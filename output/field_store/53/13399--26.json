He's liable to be along any time, now.\" He  glanced at her scorched, smoke-stained dress. \"He'll sure think you made a  hand, all right!\"    Val took the hint, and blushed with true feminine shame that she was not  looking her best. \"I'll go and change,\" she murmured, and rose wearily.  \"But I feel as if the world had been 'rolled up in a scroll and burned,' as  the Bible puts it, and as if nothing matters any more.\"    \"It does, though. We'll all go right along living the same as ever, and  the first snow will make this fire seem as old as the war--except to the  cattle; they're the ones to get it in the neck this winter.\"    He went out and walked aimlessly around in the yard, and went over to the  smoking remains of the stable, and to the heap of black ashes where the  stacks had been. Manley would be hard hit, he knew. He wished he would  hurry and come, and relieve him of the responsibility of keeping Val  company. He wondered a little, in his masculine way, that women should  always be afraid when there was no cause for fear. For instance, she had  stayed alone a good many times, evidently, when there was real danger of a  fire sweeping down upon her at any hour of the day or night; but now, when  there was no longer a possibility of anything happening, she had turned  white and begged him to stay--and Val, he judged shrewdly, was not the sort  of woman who finds it easy to beg favors of anybody.    There came a sound of galloping, up on the hill, and he turned quickly.  Dull dusk was settling bleakly down upon the land, but he could see three  or four horsemen just making the first descent from the top. He shouted a  wordless greeting, and heard their answering yells. In another minute or  two they were pulling up at the house, where he had hurried to meet them.  Val, tucking a side comb hastily into her freshly coiled hair, her pretty  self clothed all in white linen, appeased eagerly in the doorway.    \"Why--where's Manley?\" she demanded anxiously.    Blumenthall was dismounting near her, and he touched his hat before he  answered. \"We were on the way home, and we thought we'd better ride around  this way and see how you came out,\" he evaded. \"I see you lost your hay and  buildings--pretty close call for the house, too, I should judge. You must  have got here in time to do something, Kent.\"    \"But where's Manley?\" Val was growing pale again. \"Has anything happened?  Is he hurt? Tell me!\"    \"Oh, he's all right, Mrs. Fleetwood.\" Blumenthall glanced meaningly at  Kent--and Fred De Garmo, sitting to one side of his saddle, looked at  Polycarp Jenks and smiled slightly. \"We left town ahead of him, and knocked  right along.\"    Val regarded the group suspiciously. \"He's coming, then, is he?\"    \"Oh, certainly. Glad you're all right, Mrs. Fleetwood. That was an awful  fire--it swept the whole country clean between the two rivers, I'm afraid.  This wind made it bad.\" He was tightening his cinch, and now he unhooked  the stirrup from the horn and mounted again. \"We'll have to be getting  along--don't know, yet, how we came out of it over to the ranch. But our  guards ought to have stopped it there.\" He looked at Kent. \"How did the  Wishbone make it?\" he inquired.    \"I was just going to ask you if you knew,\" Kent replied, scowling because  he saw Fred looking at Val in what he considered an impertinent manner. \"My  horse ran off while I was fighting fire here, so I'm afoot. I was waiting  for Man to show up.\"    \"You'll git all of that you want--_he-he!_\" Polycarp cut in tactlessly.  \"Man won't git home t'-night--not unless--\"    \"Aw, come on.\" Fred started along the charred trail which led across the  coulee and up the farther side. Blumenthall spoke a last, commonplace  sentence or two, just to round off the conversation and make the  termination not too abrupt, and they rode away, with Polycarp glancing  curiously back, now and then, as though he was tempted to stay and gossip,  and yet was anxious to know all that had happened at the Double Diamond.    \"What did Polycarp Jenks mean--about Manley not coming to-night?\" Val was  standing in the doorway, staring after the group of horsemen.    \"Nothing, I guess, Polycarp never does mean anything half the time; he just  talks to hear his head roar. Man'll come, all right. This bunch happened to  beat him out, is all.\"    \"Oh, do you think so? Mr. Blumenthall acted as if there was something--\"    \"Well, what can you expect of a man that lives on oatmeal mush and toast  and hot water?\" Kent demanded aggressively. \"And Fred De Garmo is always  grinning and winking at somebody; and that other fellow is a Swede and got  about as much sense as a prairie dog--and Polycarp is an old granny gossip  that nobody ever pays any attention to. Man won't stay in town--hell be too  anxious.\"    \"It's terrible,\" sighed Val, \"about the hay and the stables. Manley will  be so discouraged--he worked so hard to cut and stack that hay. And he was  just going to gather the calves together and put them in the river field,  in a couple of weeks--and now there isn't anything to feed them!\"    \"I guess he's coming; I hear somebody.\" Kent was straining his eyes to see  the top of the hill, where the dismal sight shadows lay heavily upon the  dismal black earth. \"Sounds to me like a rig, though. Maybe he drove out.\"  He left her, went to the wire gate which gave egress from the tiny, unkempt  yard, and walked along the trail to meet the newcomer.    \"You stay there,\" he called back, when he thought he heard Val following  him. \"I'm just going to tell him you're all right. You'll get that white  dress all smudged up in these ashes.\"    In the narrow little gully where the trail crossed the half-dry channel  from the spring he met the rig. The driver pulled up when he caught sight  of Kent.    \"Who's that? Did she git out of it?\" cried Arline Hawley, in a breathless  undertone, \"Oh--it's you, is it, Kent? I couldn't stand it--I just had to  come and see if she's alive. So I made Hank hitch right up--as soon as we  knew the fire wasn't going to git into all that brush along the creek, and  run down to the town--and bring me over. And the way--\"    \"But where's Man?\" Kent laid a hand upon the wheel and shot the question  into the stream of Arline's talk.    \"Man! I dunno what devil gits into men sometimes. Man went and got drunk  as a fool soon as he seen the fire and knew what coulda happened out here.  Started right in to drownd his sorrows before he made sure whether he had  any to drown! If that ain't like a man, every time! Time we all got back to  town, and the fire was kiting away from us instead of coming up toward  us, he was too drunk to do anything. He must of poured it down him by the  quart. He--\"    \"Manley! Is that you, dear?\" It was Val, a slim, white figure against the  blackness all around her, coming down the trail to see what delayed them.  \"Why don't you come to the house? There _is_ a house, you know. We aren't  quite burned out. And I'm all right, so there's no need to worry any more.\"    \"Now, ain't that a darned shame?\" muttered Arline wrathfully to Kent. \"A  feller that'll drink when he's got a wife like that had oughta be hung!    \"It's me, Arline Hawley!\" She raised her voice to its ordinary shrill  level. \"It ain't just the proper time to make a call, I guess, but it's  better late than never. Man, he was took with one of his spells, so I told  him I'd come on out and take you back to town. How are you, anyhow? Scared  plumb to death, I'll bet, when that fire come over the hill. You needn't  'a' tramped clear down here--we was coming on to the house in a minute. I  got to chewin' the rag with Kent. Git in; you might as well ride back to  the house, now you're here.\"    \"Manley didn't come?\" Val was standing beside the rig, near Kent. Her  white-clothed figure was indistinct, and her face obscured in the dark. Her  voice was quiet--lifelessly quiet. \"Is he sick?\"    \"Well--of course has nerves was all upset--\"    \"Oh! Then he _is_ sick?\"    \"Well--nothing dangerous, but--he wasn't feelin' well, so I thought I'd  come out and take you back with me.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"Man was awful worried; you mustn't think he wasn't. He was pretty near  crazy, for a while.\"    \"Oh, yes, certainly.\"    \"Get in and ride. And you mustn't worry none about Man, nor feel hurt that  he didn't come. He felt so bad--\"    \"I'll walk, thank you; it's only a few steps. And I'm not worried at all. I  quite understand.\"    The team started on slowly, and Mrs. Hawley turned in the seat so that she  could continue talking without interruption to the two who walked behind.  But it was Kent who answered her at intervals, when she asked a direct  question or appeared to be waiting for some comment. Betweenwhiles he was  wondering if Val did, after all, understand. She knew so little of the West  and its ways, and her faith in Manley was so firm and unquestioning,  that he felt sure she was only hurt at what looked very much like an  indifference to her welfare. He suspected shrewdly that she was thinking  what she would have done in Manley's place, and was trying to reconcile  Mrs. Hawley's assurances that Manley was not actually sick or disabled with  the blunt fact that he had stayed in town and permitted others to come out  to see if she were alive or dead.    And Kent had another problem to solve. Should he tell her the truth? He had  never ceased to feel, in some measure, responsible for her position. And  she was sure to discover the truth before long; not even her innocence  and her ignorance of life could shield her from that knowledge. He let  a question or two of Arline's go unanswered while he struggled for a  decision, but when they reached the house, only one point was dearly  settled in his mind. Instead of riding as far as he might, and then walking  across the prairie to the Wishbone, he intended to go on to town with  them--\"to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8556"],[0,"The History of England from the Norman Conquest to the Death of John (1066-1216) (#19)"],[1," objection was ever made.  Within a few months a serious insurrection broke out among those who  hoped to make Robert king, but no one alleged that William's title was  imperfect because he had not been elected. If the English crown was held  by the people of the time to be elective in any sense, it was not in the  sense which we at present understand by the word \"constitutional.\"    Immediately after the coronation, the new king went back to Winchester to  fulfil a duty which he owed to his father. The great hoard which the  Conqueror had collected in the ancient capital was distributed with a  free hand to the churches of England. William II was as greedy of money  as his father. His exactions pressed even more heavily on the kingdom,  and the Church believed that it was peculiarly the victim of his  financial tyranny, but he showed no disposition to begrudge these  benefactions for the safety of his father's soul. Money was sent to each  monastery and church in the kingdom, and to many rich gifts of other  things, and to each county a hundred pounds for distribution to the poor.    Until the following spring the disposition of the kingdom which Lanfranc  had made was unquestioned and undisturbed. William II wore his crown at  the meeting of the court in London at Christmas time, and nothing during  the winter called for any special exertion of royal authority on his  part. But beneath the surface a great conspiracy was forming, for the  purpose of overthrowing the new king and of putting his brother Robert in  his place. During Lent the movers of this conspiracy were especially  active, and immediately after Easter the insurrection broke out. It was  an insurrection in which almost all the Norman barons of England took  part, and their real object was the interest neither of king nor of  kingdom, but only their own personal and selfish advantage. A purely  feudal insurrection, inspired solely by those local and separatist  tendencies which the feudal system cherished, it reveals, even more  clearly than the insurrection of the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk under  William I, the solid reserve of strength in the support of the nation  which was the only thing that sustained the Norman kingship in England  during the feudal age.    The writers upon whom we depend for our knowledge of these events  represent the rebellious barons as moved by two chief motives. Of these  that which is put forward as the leading motive is their opposition to  the division of the Norman land into two separate realms, by the  succession of the elder brother in Normandy and of the younger in  England. The fact that these barons held fiefs in both countries, and  under two different lords, certainly put them in an awkward position, but  in one by no means uncommon throughout the feudal world. A suzerain of  the Norman type, however, in the event of a quarrel between the king and  the duke, could make things exceedingly uncomfortable for the vassals who  held of both, and these men seem to have believed that their divided  allegiance would endanger their possessions in one land or the other.  They were in a fair way, they thought, to lose under the sons the  increase of wealth and honours for which they had fought under the  father. A second motive was found in the contrasted characters of the two  brothers. Our authorities represent this as less influential than the  first, but the circumstances of the case would lead us to believe that it  had equal weight with the barons. William they considered a man of  violence, who was likely to respect no right; Robert was \"more  tractable.\" That Robert was the elder son, that they had already sworn  allegiance to him, while they owed nothing to William, which are  suggested as among their motives, probably had no real influence in  deciding their action. But the other two motives are so completely in  accord with the facts of the situation that we must accept them as giving  the reasons for the insurrection. The barons were opposed to the  separation of the two countries, and they wished a manageable suzerain.    The insurrection was in appearance an exceedingly dangerous one. Almost  every Norman baron in England revolted and carried his vassals with him.  Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, the king's uncle, was the prime mover in the  affair. He had been released from his prison by the Conqueror on his  death-bed, and had been restored by William II to his earldom of Kent;  but his hope of becoming the chief counsellor of the king, as he had  become of Robert in Normandy, was disappointed. With him was his brother,  Robert of Cornwall, Count of Mortain. The other great baron-bishop of the  Conquest, Geoffrey of Coutances, was also in insurrection, and with him  his nephew, Robert of Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland. Another leading  rebel was Roger, Earl of Shrewsbury, with his three sons, the chief of  whom, Robert of Bellême, was sent over from Normandy by Duke Robert, with  Eustace of Boulogne, to aid the insurrection in England until he should  himself be able to cross the channel. The treason of one man, William of  St. Calais, Bishop of Durham, was regarded by the English writers as  particularly heinous, if indeed we are right in referring their words to  him and not to Bishop Odo; it is at least evident from the sequel that  the king regarded his conduct in that light. The reason is not altogether  clear, unless it be that the position of greatest influence in England,  which Bishop Odo had desired in vain, had been given him by the king.  Other familiar names must be added to these: William of Eu, Roger of  Lacy, Ralph of Mortimer, Roger Bigod, Hugh of Grantmesnil. On the king's  side there were few Norman names to equal these: Hugh of Avranches, Earl  of Chester, William of Warenne, and of course the vassals of the great  Archbishop Lanfranc. But the real strength of the king was not derived  from the baronial elements. The castles in most of the great towns  remained faithful, and so did nearly all the bishops and the Church as a  whole. But the weight which turned the scale and gave the decision to the  king, was the support of the great mass of the nation, of the English as  opposed to the Norman.    For so great a show of strength, the insurrection was very short-lived,  and it was put down with almost no fighting. The refusal of the barons to  come to the Easter court, April 14, was their first overt act of  rebellion, though it had been evident in March that the rebellion was  coming, and before the close of the summer confiscation or amnesty had  been measured out to the defeated rebels. We are told that the crown was  offered to Robert and accepted by him, and great hopes were entertained  of decisive aid which he was to send; but nothing came of it. Two sieges,  of Pevensey castle and of Rochester castle, were the most important  military events. There was considerable ravaging of the country by the  rebels in the west, and some little fighting there. The Bishop of  Coutances and his nephew seized Bristol and laid waste the country about,  but were unsuccessful in their siege of Ilchester. Roger of Lacy and  others collected a force at Hereford, and advanced to attack Worcester,  but were beaten off by the Norman garrison and the men of Bishop  Wulfstan. Minor incidents of the same kind occurred in Gloucestershire,  Leicestershire, Norfolk, and the north. But the decisive events were in  the south-east, in the operations of the king against his uncle Odo. At  London William called round him his supporters, appealing especially to  the English, and promising to grant good laws, to levy no unjust taxes,  and to allow men the freedom of their woods and of hunting. With an army  which did not seem large, he advanced against Rochester, where the Bishop  of Bayeux was, to strike the heart of the insurrection.    Tunbridge castle, which was held for Odo, was first stormed, and on the  news of this Odo thought it prudent to betake himself to Pevensey, where  his brother, Robert of Mortain, was, and where reinforcements from Robert  of Normandy would be likely to land. William at once turned from his  march to Rochester and began the siege of Pevensey. The Norman  reinforcements which Robert finally sent were driven back with great  loss, and after some weeks Pevensey was compelled to surrender. Bishop  Odo agreed to secure the surrender of Rochester, and then to retire from  England, only to return if the king should send for him. But William  unwisely sent him on to Rochester with a small advance detachment, to  occupy the castle, while he himself followed more slowly with the main  body. The castle refused to surrender. Odo's expression of face made  known his real wishes, and was more convincing than his words. A sudden  sally of the garrison overpowered his guards, and the bishop was carried  into the castle to try the fortune of a siege once more. For this siege  the king again appealed to the country and called for the help of all  under the old Saxon penalty of the disgraceful name of \"nithing.\" The  defenders of the castle suffered greatly from the blockade, and were soon  compelled to yield upon such terms as the king pleased, who was with  difficulty persuaded to give up his first idea of sending them all to the  gallows.    The monk Orderic Vitalis, who wrote an account of these events a  generation after they occurred, was struck with one characteristic of  this insurrection, which the careful observer of any time would hardly  fail to notice. He says: \"The rebels, although they were so many and  abundantly furnished with arms and supplies, did not dare to join battle  with the king in his kingdom.\" It was an age, to be sure, when wars were  decided less by fighting in the open field than by the siege and defence  of castles; and yet the collapse of so formidable an insurrection as  this, after no resistance at all in proportion to its apparent fighting  strength, is surely a"]]]
