On parting he slipped upon my finger a curiously wrought ring set  with a dead-black, lusterless stone, which appeared more like a  bit of bituminous coal than the priceless Barsoomian gem which in  reality it is.    \"There had been but three others cut from the mother stone,\" he  said, \"which is in my possession.  These three are worn by nobles  high in my confidence, all of whom have been sent on secret missions  to the court of Salensus Oll.    \"Should you come within fifty feet of any of these three you will  feel a rapid, pricking sensation in the finger upon which you wear  this ring.  He who wears one of its mates will experience the same  feeling; it is caused by an electrical action that takes place the  moment two of these gems cut from the same mother stone come within  the radius of each other's power.  By it you will know that a friend  is at hand upon whom you may depend for assistance in time of need.    \"Should another wearer of one of these gems call upon you for aid  do not deny him, and should death threaten you swallow the ring  rather than let it fall into the hands of enemies.  Guard it with  your life, John Carter, for some day it may mean more than life to  you.\"    With this parting admonition our good friend turned back toward  Marentina, and we set our faces in the direction of the city of  Kadabra and the court of Salensus Oll, Jeddak of Jeddaks.    That very evening we came within sight of the walled and glass-roofed  city of Kadabra.  It lies in a low depression near the pole,  surrounded by rocky, snow-clad hills.  From the pass through which  we entered the valley we had a splendid view of this great city of  the north.  Its crystal domes sparkled in the brilliant sunlight  gleaming above the frost-covered outer wall that circles the entire  one hundred miles of its circumference.    At regular intervals great gates give entrance to the city; but  even at the distance from which we looked upon the massive pile  we could see that all were closed, and, in accordance with Talu's  suggestion, we deferred attempting to enter the city until the  following morning.    As he had said, we found numerous caves in the hillsides about  us, and into one of these we crept for the night.  Our warm orluk  skins kept us perfectly comfortable, and it was only after a  most refreshing sleep that we awoke shortly after daylight on the  following morning.    Already the city was astir, and from several of the gates we saw  parties of yellow men emerging.  Following closely each detail  of the instructions given us by our good friend of Marentina, we  remained concealed for several hours until one party of some half  dozen warriors had passed along the trail below our hiding place  and entered the hills by way of the pass along which we had come  the previous evening.    After giving them time to get well out of sight of our cave, Thuvan  Dihn and I crept out and followed them, overtaking them when they  were well into the hills.    When we had come almost to them I called aloud to their leader, when  the whole party halted and turned toward us.  The crucial test had  come.  Could we but deceive these men the rest would be comparatively  easy.    \"Kaor!\" I cried as I came closer to them.    \"Kaor!\" responded the officer in charge of the party.    \"We be from Illall,\" I continued, giving the name of the most remote  city of Okar, which has little or no intercourse with Kadabra.  \"Only yesterday we arrived, and this morning the captain of the  gate told us that you were setting out to hunt orluks, which is  a sport we do not find in our own neighborhood.  We have hastened  after you to pray that you allow us to accompany you.\"    The officer was entirely deceived, and graciously permitted us to  go with them for the day.  The chance guess that they were bound  upon an orluk hunt proved correct, and Talu had said that the  chances were ten to one that such would be the mission of any party  leaving Kadabra by the pass through which we entered the valley,  since that way leads directly to the vast plains frequented by this  elephantine beast of prey.    In so far as the hunt was concerned, the day was a failure, for  we did not see a single orluk; but this proved more than fortunate  for us, since the yellow men were so chagrined by their misfortune  that they would not enter the city by the same gate by which they  had left it in the morning, as it seemed that they had made great  boasts to the captain of that gate about their skill at this  dangerous sport.    We, therefore, approached Kadabra at a point several miles from  that at which the party had quitted it in the morning, and so were  relieved of the danger of embarrassing questions and explanations  on the part of the gate captain, whom we had said had directed us  to this particular hunting party.    We had come quite close to the city when my attention was attracted  toward a tall, black shaft that reared its head several hundred  feet into the air from what appeared to be a tangled mass of junk  or wreckage, now partially snow-covered.    I did not dare venture an inquiry for fear of arousing suspicion  by evident ignorance of something which as a yellow man I should  have known; but before we reached the city gate I was to learn the  purpose of that grim shaft and the meaning of the mighty accumulation  beneath it.    We had come almost to the gate when one of the party called to  his fellows, at the same time pointing toward the distant southern  horizon.  Following the direction he indicated, my eyes descried  the hull of a large flier approaching rapidly from above the crest  of the encircling hills.    \"Still other fools who would solve the mysteries of the forbidden  north,\" said the officer, half to himself.  \"Will they never cease  their fatal curiosity?\"    \"Let us hope not,\" answered one of the warriors, \"for then what  should we do for slaves and sport?\"    \"True; but what stupid beasts they are to continue to come to a  region from whence none of them ever has returned.\"    \"Let us tarry and watch the end of this one,\" suggested one of the  men.    The officer looked toward the city.    \"The watch has seen him,\" he said; \"we may remain, for we may be  needed.\"    I looked toward the city and saw several hundred warriors issuing  from the nearest gate.  They moved leisurely, as though there were  no need for haste--nor was there, as I was presently to learn.    Then I turned my eyes once more toward the flier.  She was moving  rapidly toward the city, and when she had come close enough I was  surprised to see that her propellers were idle.    Straight for that grim shaft she bore.  At the last minute I saw  the great blades move to reverse her, yet on she came as though  drawn by some mighty, irresistible power.    Intense excitement prevailed upon her deck, where men were running  hither and thither, manning the guns and preparing to launch the  small, one-man fliers, a fleet of which is part of the equipment  of every Martian war vessel.  Closer and closer to the black shaft  the ship sped.  In another instant she must strike, and then I saw  the familiar signal flown that sends the lesser boats in a great  flock from the deck of the mother ship.    Instantly a hundred tiny fliers rose from her deck, like a swarm of  huge dragon flies; but scarcely were they clear of the battleship  than the nose of each turned toward the shaft, and they, too, rushed  on at frightful speed toward the same now seemingly inevitable end  that menaced the larger vessel.    A moment later the collision came.  Men were hurled in every  direction from the ship's deck, while she, bent and crumpled, took  the last, long plunge to the scrap-heap at the shaft's base.    With her fell a shower of her own tiny fliers, for each of them  had come in violent collision with the solid shaft.    I noticed that the wrecked fliers scraped down the shaft's side,  and that their fall was not as rapid as might have been expected;  and then suddenly the secret of the shaft burst upon me, and with  it an explanation of the cause that prevented a flier that passed  too far across the ice-barrier ever returning.    The shaft was a mighty magnet, and when once a vessel came within  the radius of its powerful attraction for the aluminum steel that  enters so largely into the construction of all Barsoomian craft,  no power on earth could prevent such an end as we had just witnessed.    I afterward learned that the shaft rests directly over the magnetic  pole of Mars, but whether this adds in any way to its incalculable  power of attraction I do not know.  I am a fighting man, not a  scientist.    Here, at last, was an explanation of the long absence of Tardos Mors  and Mors Kajak.  These valiant and intrepid warriors had dared the  mysteries and dangers of the frozen north to search for Carthoris,  whose long absence had bowed in grief the head of his beautiful  mother, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.    The moment that the last of the fliers came to rest at the base of  the shaft the black-bearded, yellow warriors swarmed over the mass  of wreckage upon which they lay, making prisoners of those who were  uninjured and occasionally despatching with a sword-thrust one of  the wounded who seemed prone to resent their taunts and insults.    A few of the uninjured red men battled bravely against their cruel  foes, but for the most part they seemed too overwhelmed by the  horror of the catastrophe that had befallen them to do more than  submit supinely to the golden chains with which they were manacled.    When the last of the prisoners had been confined, the party  returned to the city, at the gate of which we met a pack of fierce,  gold-collared apts, each of which marched between two warriors,  who held them with strong chains of the same metal as their collars.

That was the general understanding of the  matter here at the time. In this he made no concession of principle  whatever. He was as stiff as a man could be in his Whig doctrines.  They did this for him simply because he was popular--because he was  Lincoln. STEPHEN T. LOGAN. July 6, 1875.] say that Lincoln ran in 1832  as a Whig, and that his speeches were unevasively in defense of the  principles of that party. Without discussing the merits of the party  or its purposes, we may insist that his adopting them thus openly at  the outset of his career was an extremely characteristic act, and  marks thus early the scrupulous conscientiousness which shaped every  action of his life. The State of Illinois was by a large majority  Democratic, hopelessly attached to the person and policy of Jackson.  Nowhere had that despotic leader more violent and unscrupulous  partisans than there. They were proud of their very servility, and  preferred the name of \"whole-hog Jackson men\" to that of Democrats.  The Whigs embraced in their scanty ranks the leading men of the State,  those who have since been most distinguished in its history, such as  S. T. Logan, Stuart, Browning, Dubois, Hardin, Breese, and many  others. But they were utterly unable to do anything except by dividing  the Jackson men, whose very numbers made their party unwieldy, and by  throwing their votes with the more decent and conservative portion of  them. In this way, in the late election, they had secured the success  of Governor Reynolds--the Old Ranger--against Governor Kinney, who  represented the vehement and proscriptive spirit which Jackson had  just breathed into the party. He had visited the General in  Washington, and had come back giving out threatenings and slaughter  against the Whigs in the true Tennessee style, declaring that \"all  Whigs should be whipped out of office like dogs out of a meat-house\";  the force of south-western simile could no further go. But the great  popularity of Reynolds and the adroit management of the Whigs carried  him through successfully. A single fact will show on which side the  people who could read were enlisted. The \"whole-hog\" party had one  newspaper, the opposition five. Of course it would have been  impossible for Reynolds to poll a respectable vote if his loyalty to  Jackson had been seriously doubted. As it was, he lost many votes  through a report that he had been guilty of saying that \"he was as  strong for Jackson as any reasonable man should be.\" The Governor  himself, in his naive account of the canvass, acknowledges the  damaging nature of this accusation, and comforts himself with quoting  an indiscretion of Kinney's, who opposed a projected canal on the  ground that \"it would flood the country with Yankees.\"    It showed some moral courage, and certainly an absence of the  shuffling politician's fair-weather policy, that Lincoln, in his  obscure and penniless youth, at the very beginning of his career, when  he was not embarrassed by antecedents or family connections, and when,  in fact, what little social influence he knew would have led him the  other way, chose to oppose a furiously intolerant majority, and to  take his stand with the party which was doomed to long-continued  defeat in Illinois. The motives which led him to take this decisive  course are not difficult to imagine. The better sort of people in  Sangamon County were Whigs, though the majority were Democrats, and he  preferred through life the better sort to the majority. The papers he  read were the Louisville \"Journal\" and the \"Sangamo Journal,\" both  Whig. Reading the speeches and debates of the day, he sided with  Webster against Calhoun, and with Clay against anybody. Though his  notions of politics, like those of any ill-educated young man of  twenty-two, must have been rather crude, and not at all sufficient to  live and to die by, he had adopted them honestly and sincerely, with  no selfish regard to his own interests; and though he ardently desired  success, he never abated one jot or tittle of his convictions for any  possible personal gain, then or thereafter.    In the circular in which he announced his candidacy he made no  reference to national politics, but confined himself mainly to a  discussion of the practicability of improving the navigation of the  Sangamon, the favorite hobby of the place and time. He had no monopoly  of this \"issue.\" It formed the burden of nearly every candidate's  appeal to the people in that year. The excitement occasioned by the  trip of the _Talisman_ had not yet died away, although the little  steamer was now dust and ashes, and her bold commander had left the  State to avoid an awkward meeting with the sheriff. The hope of seeing  Springfield an emporium of commerce was still lively among the  citizens of Sangamon County, and in no one of the handbills of the  political aspirants of the season was that hope more judiciously  encouraged than in the one signed by Abraham Lincoln. It was a well-  written circular, remarkable for its soberness and, reserve when we  consider the age and the limited advantages of the writer. It  concluded in these words: \"Upon the subjects of which I have treated,  I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in regard to any or  all of them; but holding it a sound maxim that it is better only  sometimes to be right than at all times wrong, so soon as I discover  my opinions to be erroneous I shall be ready to renounce them....  Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or  not, I can say for one, that I have no other so great as that of being  truly esteemed of my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their  esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to  be developed. I am young, and unknown to many of you. I was born and  have ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy  or powerful relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown  exclusively upon the independent voters of the county; and, if  elected, they will have conferred a favor upon me, for which I shall  be unremitting in my labors to compensate. But if the good people in  their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been  too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.\"    This is almost precisely the style of his later years. The errors of  grammar and construction which spring invariably from an effort to  avoid redundancy of expression remained with him through life. He  seemed to grudge the space required for necessary parts of speech. But  his language was at twenty-two, as it was thirty years later, the  simple and manly attire of his thought, with little attempt at  ornament and none at disguise. There was an intermediate time when he  sinned in the direction of fine writing; but this ebullition soon  passed away, and left that marvelously strong and transparent style in  which his two inaugurals were written.    Of course, in the ten days left him after his return from the field, a  canvass of the county, which was then--before its division--several  thousand square miles in extent, was out of the question. He made a  few speeches in the neighborhood of New Salem, and at least one in  Springfield. He was wholly unknown there except by his few comrades in  arms. We find him mentioned in the county paper only once during the  summer, in an editorial note adding the name of Captain Lincoln to  those candidates for the Legislature who were periling their lives on  the frontier and had left their reputations in charge of their  generous fellow-citizens at home. On the occasion of his speaking at  Springfield, most of the candidates had come together to address a  meeting there to give their electors some idea of their quality. These  were severe ordeals for the rash aspirants for popular favor. Besides  those citizens who came to listen and judge, there were many whose  only object was the free whisky provided for the occasion, and who,  after potations pottle-deep, became not only highly unparliamentary  but even dangerous to life and limb. This wild chivalry of Lick Creek  was, however, less redoubtable to Lincoln than it might be to an urban  statesman unacquainted with the frolic brutality of Clary's Grove.  Their gambols never caused him to lose his self-possession. It is  related that once, while he was speaking, he saw a ruffian attack a  friend of his in the crowd, and the rencontre not resulting according  to the orator's sympathies, he descended from the stand, seized the  objectionable fighting man by the neck, \"threw him some ten feet,\"  then calmly mounted to his place and finished his speech, the course  of his logic undisturbed by this athletic parenthesis. Judge Logan saw  Lincoln for the first time on the day when he came up to Springfield  on his canvass this summer. He thus speaks of his future partner: \"He  was a very tall, gawky, and rough-looking fellow then; his pantaloons  didn't meet his shoes by six inches. But after he began speaking I  became very much interested in him. He made a very sensible speech.  His manner was very much the same as in after life; that is, the same  peculiar characteristics were apparent then, though of course in after  years he evinced more knowledge and experience. But he had then the  same novelty and the same peculiarity in presenting his ideas. He had  the same individuality that he kept through all his life.\"    There were two or three men at the meeting whose good opinion was  worth more than all the votes of Lick Creek to one beginning life:  Stephen T. Logan, a young lawyer who had recently come from Kentucky  with the best equipment for a _nisi prius_ practitioner ever  brought into the State; Major Stuart, whom we have met in the Black  Hawk war, once commanding a battalion and then marching as a private;  and"]]]
