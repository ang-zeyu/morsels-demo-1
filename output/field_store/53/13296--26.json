[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Complete (#19)"],[1," Pentaur--\"a priest, who in the war of free-will  against law becomes a deserter, who forgets his duty and his oath--he  will not long stand beside thee to support thee, for he--even though  every God had blessed him with the richest gifts--he is damned. We drive  him from among us, we curse him, we--\"    At these words Bent-Anat looked now at Ameni, trembling with excitement,  now at Pentaur standing opposite to her. Her face was red and white  by turns, as light and shade chase each other on the ground when at  noon-day a palm-grove is stirred by a storm.    The poet took a step towards her.    She felt that if he spoke it would be to defend all that she had done,  and to ruin himself. A deep sympathy, a nameless anguish seized her  soul, and before Pentaur could open his lips, she had sunk slowly down  before Ameni, saying in low tones:    \"I have sinned and defiled myself; thou hast said it--as Pentaur said it  by the hut of the paraschites. Restore me to cleanness, Ameni, for I am  unclean.\"    Like a flame that is crushed out by a hand, so the fire in the  high-priest's eye was extinguished. Graciously, almost lovingly, he  looked down on the princess, blessed her and conducted her before the  holy of holies, there had clouds of incense wafted round her, anointed  her with the nine holy oils, and commanded her to return to the royal  castle.    Yet, said he, her guilt was not expiated; she should shortly learn by  what prayers and exercises she might attain once more to perfect purity  before the Gods, of whom he purposed to enquire in the holy place.    During all these ceremonies the priests stationed in the forecourt  continued their lamentations.    The people standing before the temple listened to the priest's chant,  and interrupted it from time to time with ringing cries of wailing, for  already a dark rumor of what was going on within had spread among the  multitude.    The sun was going down. The visitors to the Necropolis must soon be  leaving it, and Bent-Anat, for whose appearance the people impatiently  waited, would not show herself. One and another said the princess had  been cursed, because she had taken remedies to the fair and injured  Uarda, who was known to many of them.    Among the curious who had flocked together were many embalmers,  laborers, and humble folk, who lived in the Necropolis. The mutinous and  refractory temper of the Egyptians, which brought such heavy suffering  on them under their later foreign rulers, was aroused, and rising  with every minute. They reviled the pride of the priests, and their  senseless, worthless, institutions. A drunken soldier, who soon reeled  back into the tavern which he had but just left, distinguished himself  as ringleader, and was the first to pick up a heavy stone to fling at  the huge brass-plated temple gates. A few boys followed his example  with shouts, and law-abiding men even, urged by the clamor of fanatical  women, let themselves be led away to stone-flinging and words of abuse.    Within the House of Seti the priests' chant went on uninterruptedly;  but at last, when the noise of the crowd grew louder, the great gate was  thrown open, and with a solemn step Ameni, in full robes, and followed  by twenty pastophori--[An order of priests]--who bore images of the Gods  and holy symbols on their shoulders--Ameni walked into the midst of the  crowd.    All were silent.    \"Wherefore do you disturb our worship?\" he asked loudly and calmly.    A roar of confused cries answered him, in which the frequently repeated  name of Bent-Anat could alone be distinguished.    Ameni preserved his immoveable composure, and, raising his crozier, he  cried--    \"Make way for the daughter of Rameses, who sought and has found  purification from the Gods, who behold the guilt of the highest as  of the lowest among you. They reward the pious, but they punish the  offender. Kneel down and let us pray that they may forgive you, and  bless both you and your children.\"    Ameni took the holy Sistrum       [A rattling metal instrument used by the Egyptians in the service of     the Gods. Many specimens are extant in Museums. Plutarch describes     it correctly, thus: \"The Sistrum is rounded above, and the loop     holds the four bars which are shaken.\" On the bend of the Sistrum     they often set the head of a cat with a human face.]    from one of the attendant pastophori, and held it on high; the priests  behind him raised a solemn hymn, and the crowd sank on their knees; nor  did they move till the chant ceased and the high-priest again cried out:    \"The Immortals bless you by me their servant. Leave this spot and make  way for the daughter of Rameses.\"    With these words he withdrew into the temple, and the patrol, without  meeting with any opposition, cleared the road guarded by Sphinxes which  led to the Nile.    As Bent-Anat mounted her chariot Ameni said \"Thou art the child of  kings. The house of thy father rests on the shoulders of the people.  Loosen the old laws which hold them subject, and the people will conduct  themselves like these fools.\"    Ameni retired. Bent-Anat slowly arranged the reins in her hand, her eyes  resting the while on the poet, who, leaning against a door-post, gazed  at her in beatitude. She let her whip fall to the ground, that he might  pick it up and restore it to her, but he did not observe it. A runner  sprang forward and handed it to the princess, whose horses started off,  tossing themselves and neighing.    Pentaur remained as if spell-bound, standing by the pillar, till the  rattle of the departing wheels on the flag-way of the Avenue of Sphinxes  had altogether died away, and the reflection of the glowing sunset  painted the eastern hills with soft and rosy hues.    The far-sounding clang of a brass gong roused the poet from his ecstasy.  It was the tomtom calling him to duty, to the lecture on rhetoric which  at this hour he had to deliver to the young priests. He laid his left  hand to his heart, and pressed his right hand to his forehead, as if  to collect in its grasp his wandering thoughts; then silently and  mechanically he went towards the open court in which his disciples  awaited him. But instead of, as usual, considering on the way the  subject he was to treat, his spirit and heart were occupied with the  occurrences of the last few hours. One image reigned supreme in his  imagination, filling it with delight--it was that of the fairest woman,  who, radiant in her royal dignity and trembling with pride, had thrown  herself in the dust for his sake. He felt as if her action had invested  her whole being with a new and princely worth, as if her glance had  brought light to his inmost soul, he seemed to breathe a freer air, to  be borne onward on winged feet.    In such a mood he appeared before his hearers. When he found himself  confronting all the the well-known faces, he remembered what it was  he was called upon to do. He supported himself against the wall of the  court, and opened the papyrus-roll handed to him by his favorite pupil,  the young Anana. It was the book which twenty-four hours ago he had  promised to begin upon. He looked now upon the characters that covered  it, and felt that he was unable to read a word.    With a powerful effort he collected himself, and looking upwards tried  to find the thread he had cut at the end of yesterday's lecture, and  intended to resume to-day; but between yesterday and to-day, as it  seemed to him, lay a vast sea whose roaring surges stunned his memory  and powers of thought.    His scholars, squatting cross-legged on reed mats before him, gazed in  astonishment on their silent master who was usually so ready of speech,  and looked enquiringly at each other. A young priest whispered to his  neighbor, \"He is praying--\" and Anana noticed with silent anxiety the  strong hand of his teacher clutching the manuscript so tightly that the  slight material of which it consisted threatened to split.    At last Pentaur looked down; he had found a subject. While he was  looking upwards his gaze fell on the opposite wall, and the painted  name of the king with the accompanying title \"the good God\" met his eye.  Starting from these words he put this question to his hearers, \"How do  we apprehend the Goodness of the Divinity?\"    He challenged one priest after another to treat this subject as if he  were standing before his future congregation.    Several disciples rose, and spoke with more or less truth and feeling.  At last it came to Anana's turn, who, in well-chosen words, praised  the purpose-full beauty of animate and inanimate creation, in which the  goodness of Amon       [Amon, that is to say, \"the hidden one.\" He was the God of Thebes,     which was under his aegis, and after the Hykssos were expelled from     the Nile-valley, he was united with Ra of Heliopolis and endowed     with the attributes of all the remaining Gods. His nature was more     and more spiritualized, till in the esoteric philosophy of the time     of the Rameses he is compared to the All filling and All guiding     intelligence. He is \"the husband of his mother, his own father, and     his own son,\" As the living Osiris, he is the soul and spirit of all     creation.]    of Ra,       [Ra, originally the Sun-God; later his name was introduced into the     pantheistic mystic philosophy for that of the God who is the     Universe.]    and Ptah,       [Ptah is the Greek Henhaistas, the oldest of the Gods, the great     maker of the material for the creation, the \"first beginner,\" by     whose side the seven Chnemu stand, as architects, to help him, and     who was named \"the lord of truth,\" because the laws and conditions     of being proceeded from him. He created also the germ of light, he     stood therefore at the head of the solar Gods, and was called the     creator of ice, from which, when he had cleft it, the sun and the     moan came forth. Hence his name \"the opener.\"]    as well "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#19)"],[1,"thou Croesus? my daughter Tachot can speak of nothing else  than of this beardless youth, who seems to have quite turned her little  head with his sweet looks and words. Thou needest not to blush, young  madcap! A man such as thou art, may well look at king's daughters; but  wert thou thy father Cyrus himself, I could not allow my Tachot to leave  me for Persia!\"    \"Father!\" whispered the crown-prince Psamtik, interrupting this  conversation. \"Father, take care what you say, and remember Phanes.\" The  king turned a frowning glance on his son; but following his advice, took  much less part in the conversation, which now became more general.    The seat at the banquet-table, occupied by Aristomachus, placed him  nearly opposite to Croesus, on whom, in total silence and without once  indulging in a smile at the king's jests, his eyes had been fixed  from the beginning of the revel. When the Pharaoh ceased to speak, he  accosted Croesus suddenly with the following question: \"I would know,  Lydian, whether the snow still covered the mountains, when ye left  Persia.\"    Smiling, and a little surprised at this strange speech, Croesus  answered: \"Most of the Persian mountains were green when we started for  Egypt four months ago; but there are heights in the land of Cambyses  on which, even in the hottest seasons, the snow never melts, and the  glimmer of their white crests we could still perceive, as we descended  into the plains.\"    The Spartan's face brightened visibly, and Croesus, attracted by this  serious, earnest man, asked his name. \"My name is Aristomachus.\"    \"That name seems known to me.\"    \"You were acquainted with many Hellenes, and my name is common among  them.\"    \"Your dialect would bespeak you my opinion a Spartan.\"    \"I was one once.\"    \"And now no more?\"    \"He who forsakes his native land without permission, is worthy of  death.\"    \"Have you forsaken it with your own free-will?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"For what reason?\"    \"To escape dishonor.\"    \"What was your crime?\"    \"I had committed none.\"    \"You were accused unjustly?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who was the author of your ill-fortune?\"    \"Yourself.\"    Croesus started from his seat. The serious tone and gloomy face of  the Spartan proved that this was no jest, and those who sat near the  speakers, and had been following this strange dialogue, were alarmed and  begged Aristomachus to explain his words.    He hesitated and seemed unwilling to speak; at last, however, at the  king's summons, he began thus:    \"In obedience to the oracle, you, Croesus, had chosen us Lacedaemonians,  as the most powerful among the Hellenes, to be your allies against the  might of Persia; and you gave us gold for the statue of Apollo on Mount  Thornax. The ephori, on this, resolved to present you with a gigantic  bronze wine-bowl, richly wrought. I was chosen as bearer of this gift.  Before reaching Sardis our ship was wrecked in a storm. The wine-cup  sank with it, and we reached Samos with nothing but our lives. On  returning home I was accused by enemies, and those who grudged my good  fortune, of having sold both ship and wine-vessel to the Samians. As  they could not convict me of the crime, and had yet determined on my  ruin, I was sentenced to two days' and nights' exposure on the pillory.  My foot was chained to it during the night; but before the morning of  disgrace dawned, my brother brought me secretly a sword, that my honor  might be saved, though at the expense of my life. But I could not  die before revenging myself on the men who had worked my ruin; and  therefore, cutting the manacled foot from my leg, I escaped, and hid in  the rushes on the banks of the Furotas. My brother brought me food and  drink in secret; and after two months I was able to walk on the wooden  leg you now see. Apollo undertook my revenge; he never misses his mark,  and my two worst opponents died of the plague. Still I durst not return  home, and at length took ship from Gythium to fight against the Persians  under you, Croesus. On landing at Teos, I heard that you were king no  longer, that the mighty Cyrus, the father of yonder beautiful youth, had  conquered the powerful province of Lydia in a few weeks, and reduced the  richest of kings to beggary.\"    Every guest gazed at Aristomachus in admiration. Croesus shook his hard  hand; and Bartja exclaimed: \"Spartan, I would I could take you back with  me to Susa, that my friends there might see what I have seen myself, the  most courageous, the most honorable of men!\"    \"Believe me, boy,\" returned Aristomachus smiling, \"every Spartan would  have done the same. In our country it needs more courage to be a coward  than a brave man.\"    \"And you, Bartja,\" cried Darius, the Persian king's cousin, \"could you  have borne to stand at the pillory?\" Bartja reddened, but it was easy to  see that he too preferred death to disgrace.    \"Zopyrus, what say you?\" asked Darius of the third young Persian.    \"I could mutilate my own limbs for love of you two,\" answered he,  grasping unobserved the hands of his two friends.    With an ironical smile Psamtik sat watching this scene--the pleased  faces of Amasis, Croesus and Gyges, the meaning glances of the  Egyptians, and the contented looks with which Aristomachus gazed on the  young heroes.    Ibykus now told of the oracle which had promised Aristomachus a return  to his native land, on the approach of the men from the snowy mountains,  and at the same time, mentioned the hospitable house of Rhodopis.    On hearing this name Psamtik grew restless; Croesus expressed a wish to  form the acquaintance of the Thracian matron, of whom AEsop had related  so much that was praiseworthy; and, as the other guests, many of whom  had lost consciousness through excessive drinking, were leaving the  hall, the dethroned monarch, the poet, the sculptor and the Spartan hero  made an agreement to go to Naukratis the next day, and there enjoy the  conversation of Rhodopis.          CHAPTER VI.    On the night following the banquet just described, Amasis allowed  himself only three hours' rest. On this, as on every other morning, the  young priests wakened him at the first cock-crow, conducted him as usual  to the bath, arrayed him in the royal vestments and led him to the altar  in the court of the palace, where in presence of the populace he offered  sacrifice. During the offering the priests sang prayers in a loud voice,  enumerated the virtues of their king, and, that blame might in no case  light on the head of their ruler, made his bad advisers responsible for  every deadly sin committed in ignorance.    They exhorted him to the performance of good deeds, while extolling his  virtues; read aloud profitable portions of the holy writings, containing  the deeds and sayings of great men, and then conducted him to his  apartments, where letters and information from all parts of the kingdom  awaited him.    Amasis was in the habit of observing most faithfully these  daily-repeated ceremonies and hours of work; the remaining portion of  the day he spent as it pleased him, and generally in cheerful society.    The priests reproached him with this, alleging that such a life was  not suited to a monarch; and on one occasion he had thus replied to the  indignant high-priest: \"Look at this bow! if always bent it must lose  its power, but, if used for half of each day and then allowed to rest,  it will remain strong and useful till the string breaks.\"    Amasis had just signed his name to the last letter, granting the  petition of a Nornarch--[Administrator of a Province]--for money  to carry on different embankments rendered necessary by the last  inundation, when a servant entered, bringing a request from the  crown-prince Psamtik for an audience of a few minutes.    Amasis, who till this moment had been smiling cheerfully at the cheering  reports from all parts of the country, now became suddenly serious and  thoughtful. After long delay he answered: \"Go and inform the prince that  he may appear.\"    Psamtik appeared, pale and gloomy as ever; he bowed low and  reverentially, on entering his father's presence.    Amasis nodded silently in return, and then asked abruptly and sternly:  \"What is thy desire? my time is limited.\"    \"For your son, more than for others,\" replied the prince with quivering  lips. \"Seven times have I petitioned for the great favor, which thou  grantest for the first time to-day.\"    \"No reproaches! I suspect the reason of thy visit. Thou desirest an  answer to thy doubts as to the birth of thy sister Nitetis.\"    \"I have no curiosity; I come rather to warn thee, and to remind thee  that I am not the only one who is acquainted with this mystery.\"    \"Speakest thou of Phanes?\"    \"Of whom else should I speak? He is banished from Egypt and from his  own country, and must leave Naukratis in a few days. What guarantee hast  thou, that he will not betray us to the Persians?\"    \"The friendship and kindness which I have always shown him.\"    \"Dost thou believe in the gratitude of men?\"    \"No! but I rely on my own discernment of character. Phanes will not  betray us! he is my friend, I repeat it!\"    \"Thy friend perhaps, but my mortal enemy!\"    \"Then stand on thy guard! I have nothing to fear from him.\"    \"For thyself perhaps nought, but for our country! O father, reflect that  though as thy son I may be hateful in thine eyes, yet as Egypt's future  I ought to be near thy heart. Remember, that at thy death, which may the  gods long avert, I shall represent the existence of this glorious land  as thou dost now; my fall will be the ruin of thine house, of Egypt!\"    Amasis became more and more serious, and Psamtik went on eagerly: \"Thou  knowest that I am right! Phanes can betray our land to any foreign  enemy; he is as intimately acquainted with it as we are; and beside  this, he possesses a secret, the knowledge of which would convert our  most powerful ally into a most formidable enemy.\"    \"There"]]]
