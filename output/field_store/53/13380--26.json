The power that protects you would crumble my sinews,  and reduce me to a heap of ashes in a moment, if I were to harbour a  thought hostile to your safety. Thus are appearances at length solved.  Little did I expect that they originated hence. What a portion is  assigned to you? Scanned by the eyes of this intelligence, your path  will be without pits to swallow, or snares to entangle you. Environed by  the arms of this protection, all artifices will be frustrated, and all  malice repelled.\"    Here succeeded a new pause. I was still observant of every gesture and  look. The tranquil solemnity that had lately possessed his countenance  gave way to a new expression. All now was trepidation and anxiety.    \"I must be gone,\" said he in a faltering accent. \"Why do I linger here?  I will not ask your forgiveness. I see that your terrors are invincible.  Your pardon will be extorted by fear, and not dictated by compassion. I  must fly from you forever. He that could plot against your honor, must  expect from you and your friends persecution and death. I must doom  myself to endless exile.\"    Saying this, he hastily left the room. I listened while he descended the  stairs, and, unbolting the outer door, went forth. I did not follow him  with my eyes, as the moon-light would have enabled me to do. Relieved by  his absence, and exhausted by the conflict of my fears, I threw myself  on a chair, and resigned myself to those bewildering ideas which  incidents like these could not fail to produce.        Chapter X      Order could not readily be introduced into my thoughts. The voice still  rung in my ears. Every accent that was uttered by Carwin was fresh in my  remembrance. His unwelcome approach, the recognition of his person, his  hasty departure, produced a complex impression on my mind which no words  can delineate. I strove to give a slower motion to my thoughts, and to  regulate a confusion which became painful; but my efforts were nugatory.  I covered my eyes with my hand, and sat, I know not how long, without  power to arrange or utter my conceptions.    I had remained for hours, as I believed, in absolute solitude. No  thought of personal danger had molested my tranquillity. I had made  no preparation for defence. What was it that suggested the design of  perusing my father's manuscript? If, instead of this, I had retired  to bed, and to sleep, to what fate might I not have been reserved? The  ruffian, who must almost have suppressed his breathing to screen himself  from discovery, would have noticed this signal, and I should have  awakened only to perish with affright, and to abhor myself. Could I have  remained unconscious of my danger? Could I have tranquilly slept in the  midst of so deadly a snare?    And who was he that threatened to destroy me? By what means could he  hide himself in this closet? Surely he is gifted with supernatural  power. Such is the enemy of whose attempts I was forewarned. Daily I had  seen him and conversed with him. Nothing could be discerned through the  impenetrable veil of his duplicity. When busied in conjectures, as to  the author of the evil that was threatened, my mind did not light, for  a moment, upon his image. Yet has he not avowed himself my enemy? Why  should he be here if he had not meditated evil?    He confesses that this has been his second attempt. What was the scene  of his former conspiracy? Was it not he whose whispers betrayed him? Am  I deceived; or was there not a faint resemblance between the voice of  this man and that which talked of grasping my throat, and extinguishing  my life in a moment? Then he had a colleague in his crime; now he  is alone. Then death was the scope of his thoughts; now an injury  unspeakably more dreadful. How thankful should I be to the power that  has interposed to save me!    That power is invisible. It is subject to the cognizance of one of my  senses. What are the means that will inform me of what nature it is?  He has set himself to counterwork the machinations of this man, who had  menaced destruction to all that is dear to me, and whose cunning had  surmounted every human impediment. There was none to rescue me from  his grasp. My rashness even hastened the completion of his scheme, and  precluded him from the benefits of deliberation. I had robbed him of the  power to repent and forbear. Had I been apprized of the danger, I should  have regarded my conduct as the means of rendering my escape from it  impossible. Such, likewise, seem to have been the fears of my invisible  protector. Else why that startling intreaty to refrain from opening the  closet? By what inexplicable infatuation was I compelled to proceed?    Yet my conduct was wise. Carwin, unable to comprehend my folly, ascribed  my behaviour to my knowledge. He conceived himself previously detected,  and such detection being possible to flow only from MY heavenly friend,  and HIS enemy, his fears acquired additional strength.    He is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being. Perhaps he  is a human agent. Yet, on that supposition his atchievements are  incredible. Why should I be selected as the object of his care; or, if  a mere mortal, should I not recognize some one, whom, benefits imparted  and received had prompted to love me? What were the limits and duration  of his guardianship? Was the genius of my birth entrusted by divine  benignity with this province? Are human faculties adequate to  receive stronger proofs of the existence of unfettered and beneficent  intelligences than I have received?    But who was this man's coadjutor? The voice that acknowledged an  alliance in treachery with Carwin warned me to avoid the summer-house.  He assured me that there only my safety was endangered. His assurance,  as it now appears, was fallacious. Was there not deceit in his  admonition? Was his compact really annulled? Some purpose was, perhaps,  to be accomplished by preventing my future visits to that spot. Why was  I enjoined silence to others, on the subject of this admonition, unless  it were for some unauthorized and guilty purpose?    No one but myself was accustomed to visit it. Backward, it was hidden  from distant view by the rock, and in front, it was screened from all  examination, by creeping plants, and the branches of cedars. What  recess could be more propitious to secrecy? The spirit which haunted it  formerly was pure and rapturous. It was a fane sacred to the memory  of infantile days, and to blissful imaginations of the future! What a  gloomy reverse had succeeded since the ominous arrival of this stranger!  Now, perhaps, it is the scene of his meditations. Purposes fraught with  horror, that shun the light, and contemplate the pollution of innocence,  are here engendered, and fostered, and reared to maturity.    Such were the ideas that, during the night, were tumultuously revolved  by me. I reviewed every conversation in which Carwin had borne a part.  I studied to discover the true inferences deducible from his deportment  and words with regard to his former adventures and actual views. I  pondered on the comments which he made on the relation which I had given  of the closet dialogue. No new ideas suggested themselves in the course  of this review. My expectation had, from the first, been disappointed  on the small degree of surprize which this narrative excited in him. He  never explicitly declared his opinion as to the nature of those voices,  or decided whether they were real or visionary. He recommended no  measures of caution or prevention.    But what measures were now to be taken? Was the danger which threatened  me at an end? Had I nothing more to fear? I was lonely, and without  means of defence. I could not calculate the motives and regulate the  footsteps of this person. What certainty was there, that he would not  re-assume his purposes, and swiftly return to the execution of them?    This idea covered me once more with dismay. How deeply did I regret the  solitude in which I was placed, and how ardently did I desire the return  of day! But neither of these inconveniencies were susceptible of remedy.  At first, it occurred to me to summon my servant, and make her spend the  night in my chamber; but the inefficacy of this expedient to enhance my  safety was easily seen. Once I resolved to leave the house, and retire  to my brother's, but was deterred by reflecting on the unseasonableness  of the hour, on the alarm which my arrival, and the account which I  should be obliged to give, might occasion, and on the danger to which I  might expose myself in the way thither. I began, likewise, to consider  Carwin's return to molest me as exceedingly improbable. He had  relinquished, of his own accord, his design, and departed without  compulsion. \"Surely,\" said I, \"there is omnipotence in the cause that  changed the views of a man like Carwin. The divinity that shielded me  from his attempts will take suitable care of my future safety. Thus to  yield to my fears is to deserve that they should be real.\"    Scarcely had I uttered these words, when my attention was startled by  the sound of footsteps. They denoted some one stepping into the piazza  in front of my house. My new-born confidence was extinguished in a  moment. Carwin, I thought, had repented his departure, and was hastily  returning. The possibility that his return was prompted by intentions  consistent with my safety, found no place in my mind. Images of  violation and murder assailed me anew, and the terrors which succeeded  almost incapacitated me from taking any measures for my defence. It was  an impulse of which I was scarcely conscious, that made me fasten the  lock and draw the bolts of my chamber door. Having done this, I threw  myself on a seat; for I trembled to a degree which disabled me from  standing, and my soul was so perfectly absorbed in the act of listening,  that almost the vital motions were stopped.    The door"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#19)"],[1,"by  thongs of bamboo. Cutting a passage through these, we entered the place,  which contained perhaps a hundred houses, neatly built of wicker-work, and  having their high conical roofs thatched with palmetto-leaves. Such  edifices were in the highest degree combustible, and being set on fire, it  was worth while for a lover of the picturesque to watch the flames, as  they ran up the conical roofs, and meeting at the apex, whirled themselves  fiercely into the darkened air.    While this was going on, the war-bells, drums, and war-horns of the  natives were continually sounding; and flocks of vultures (perhaps a more  accurate ornithologist might call them turkey-buzzards) appeared in the  sky, wheeling slowly and heavily over our heads. These ravenous birds  seemed to have a presentiment that there were deeds of valor to be done:  nor was it quite a comfortable idea, that some of them, ere nightfall,  might gratify their appetite at one's own personal expense. To confess the  truth, however, they were probably attracted by the scent of some  slaughtered bullocks; it being indifferent to a turkey-buzzard whether he  prey on a cow or a Christian. After destroying the first town, we marched  about a mile and a half up the beach, to attack a second. On our advance,  the marine drummer and fifer were ordered from the front of the column to  the rear, as being a position of less danger. They of course obeyed; but  the little drummer deeming it a reflection upon his courage, burst into  tears, and actually blubbered aloud as he beat the _pas de charge_. It  was a strange operation of manly spirit in a boyish stage of development.    As we approached the second town, our boat-keepers, who watched the scene,  distinctly saw a party of thirty or forty natives lying behind a palisade,  with their guns pointed at our advanced guard. Unconscious that the enemy  were so near, we halted for an instant, about forty yards from the town,  and then advanced at a run. This so disconcerted the defenders that they  fled, after firing only a few shots, none of which took effect. In fact,  the natives proved themselves but miserable marksmen. They can seldom hit  an object in motion, although, if a man stand still, they sometimes manage  to put a copper-slug into his body, by taking aim a long time. After  firing, the savage runs a long distance before he ventures to load. Had  their skill or their hardihood been greater, we must have suffered  severely; for the woods extended nearly to the water's edge, and exposed  us, during the whole day, to the fire of a sheltered and invisible enemy.    After the storm and conflagration of the second town, we took a brief  rest, and then proceeded to capture and burn another, situated about a  mile to the northward. This accomplished, we judged it to be dinner-time.  Indeed, we had done work enough to ensure an appetite; and history does  not make mention, so far as I am aware, of such destruction of cities so  expeditiously effected. Having emptied our baskets, we advanced about  three miles along the beach--still with the slugs of the enemy whistling  in our ears--and gave to the devouring element another town. Man is  perhaps never happier than when his native destructiveness can be freely  exercised, and with the benevolent complacency of performing a good  action, instead of the remorse of perpetrating a bad one. It unites the  charms of sin and virtue. Thus, in all probability, few of us had ever  spent a day of higher enjoyment than this, when we roamed about, with a  musket in one hand and a torch in the other, devastating what had hitherto  been the homes of a people.    One of the sweetest spots that I have seen in Africa, was a little hamlet  of three houses, standing apart from the four large towns above-mentioned,  and surrounded by an impervious hedge of thorn-bushes, with two palisaded  entrances. Forcing our way through one of these narrow portals, we beheld  a grassy area of about fifty yards across, overshadowed by a tree of very  dense foliage, which had its massive roots in the centre, and spread its  great protecting branches over the whole enclosure. The three dwellings  were of the same sort of basket-work as those already described, but  particularly neat, and giving a pleasant impression of the domestic life  of their inhabitants. This small, secluded hamlet had probably been the  residence of one family, a patriarch, perhaps, with his descendants to the  third or fourth generation--who, beneath that shadowy tree, must have  enjoyed all the happiness of which uncultivated man is susceptible. Nor  would it be too great a stretch of liberality, to suppose that the green  hedge of impervious thorns had kept out the vices of their race, and that  the little area within was a sphere where all the virtues of the native  African had been put in daily practice. These three dwellings, and the  verdant wall around them, and the great tree that brooded over the whole,  might unquestionably have been spared, with safety to our consciences. But  when man takes upon himself the office of an avenger by the sword, he is  not to be perplexed with such little scrupulosities, as whether one  individual or family be less guilty than the rest. Providence, it is to be  presumed, will find some method of setting such matters right. In fine,  when the negro patriarch's strong sable sons supported their decrepit sire  homeward, with their wives, \"black, but comely,\" bearing the glistening,  satin-skinned babies on their backs, and their other little ebony  responsibilities trudging in the rear, there must have been a dismal wail;  for there was the ancestral tree, its foliage shrivelled with fire,  stretching out its desolate arms over the ashes of the three wicker  dwellings.    The business of the day was over. Besides short excursions, and charges  into the bush, the men had marched and countermarched at least twelve  miles upon the beach, with the surf sometimes rolling far beyond our  track. Some hundreds of slugs had been fired at us; and, on our part, we  had blazed away at every native who had ventured to show his face; but the  amount of casualties, after such a day of battle, reminds one of the  bloodless victories and defeats of an Italian army, during the middle  ages. In a word, we had but two men wounded; and whether any of the enemy  were killed or no, it is impossible to say. At all events, we slew a  number of neat cattle, eight or nine of which were sent on board the  ships, where they answered a much better purpose than as many human  carcasses. The other spoil consisted of several canoes, together with  numerous household utensils--which we shall bring home as trophies and  curiosities. There was also a chain cable, and many other articles  belonging to the Mary Carver, and a pocket-book, containing a letter  addressed to Captain Robert McFarland. The purport of the epistle is not a  matter of public interest; but it was written in a lady's delicate hand,  and was probably warm with affection; and little did the fair writer dream  that her missive would find its way into an African hut, where it was  probably regarded as a piece of witchcraft.    Thus ended the warfare of Little Berebee. The degree of retribution meted  out had by no means exceeded what the original outrage demanded; and the  mode of it was sanctioned by the customs of the African people. According  to their unwritten laws, if individuals of a tribe commit a crime against  another tribe or nation, the criminal must either be delivered up, or  punished at home, or the tribe itself becomes responsible for their guilt.  An example was of peremptory necessity; and the American vessels trading  on the coast will long experience a good effect from this day's battle and  destruction. The story will be remembered in the black man's traditions,  and will have its due weight in many a palaver. Nevertheless, though the  burning of villages be a very pretty pastime, yet it leaves us in a  moralizing mood, as most pleasures are apt to do; and one would fain hope  that civilized man, in his controversies with the barbarian, will at  length cease to descend to the barbarian level, and may adopt some other  method of proving his superiority, than by his greater power to inflict  suffering. For myself personally, the \"good old way\" suits me tolerably  enough; but I am disinterestedly anxious that posterity should find a  better.    16.--We sailed at day-light for Grand Berebee. Nearing the point on which  it is situated, the ships hoisted white flags at the fore, in token of  amity. A message was sent on shore to the King, who came off in a large  canoe, and set his hand to a treaty, promising to keep good faith with  American vessels. He likewise made himself responsible for the good  conduct of the other tribes in the vicinity.    On board the Macedonian, there were five prisoners, who had been taken two  months ago, by the brig Porpoise. One was the eldest son of this King, and  the others belonged to his tribe. The meeting between the King and prince  was very affecting, and fully proved that nature has not left these wild  people destitute of warmth and tenderness of heart. They threw themselves  into each other's arms, wept, laughed, and danced for joy. To the King,  his son was like one risen from the dead; he had given him up for lost,  supposing that the young man had been executed. The prisoners were each  presented with a new frock and trowsers, besides tobacco, handkerchiefs,  and other suitable gifts. The prince received a lieutenant's old uniform  coat; and when they got into their canoe, it was amusing to see how  awkwardly he paddled, in this outlandish trim. He made two or three  attempts to get the coat off, but without success. One of his companions  then offered his assistance; but as he took the prince by the collar,  instead of the sleeve, it was found impracticable to rid him of the  garment. "]]]
