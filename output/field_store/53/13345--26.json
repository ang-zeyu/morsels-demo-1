The views of Marx on the State are not very  clear. On the one hand he seems willing,, like the  modern State Socialists, to allow great power to the  State, but on the other hand he suggests that when  the Socialist revolution has been consummated, the  State, as we know it, will disappear. Among the  measures which are advocated in the Communist  Manifesto as immediately desirable, there are several  which would very greatly increase the power of  the existing State. For example, ``Centralization  of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a  national bank with State capital and an exclusive  monopoly;'' and again, ``Centralization of the  means of communication and transport in the hands  of the State.'' But the Manifesto goes on to say:      When, in the course of development, class distinctions  have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated  in the hands of a vast association of the whole  nation, the public power will lose its political character.  Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised  power of one class for oppressing another. If the  proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is  compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize  itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes  itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by  force the old conditions of production, then it will,  along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions  for the existence of class antagonisms, and of  classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its  own supremacy as a class.    In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes  and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in  which; the free development of each is the condition for  the free development of all.[47]      [47] Communist Manifesto, p. 22.      This attitude Marx preserved in essentials  throughout his life. Accordingly, it is not to be  wondered at that his followers, so far as regards their  immediate aims, have in the main become out-and-out  State Socialists. On the other hand, the Syndicalists,  who accept from Marx the doctrine of the class  war, which they regard as what is really vital in his  teaching, reject the State with abhorrence and wish  to abolish it wholly, in which respect they are at one  with the Anarchists. The Guild Socialists, though  some persons in this country regard them as extremists,  really represent the English love of compromise.  The Syndicalist arguments as to the dangers inherent  in the power of the State have made them dissatisfied  with the old State Socialism, but they are  unable to accept the Anarchist view that society can  dispense altogether with a central authority.  Accordingly they propose that there should be two  co-equal instruments of Government in a community,  the one geographical, representing the consumers,  and essentially the continuation of the democratic  State; the other representing the producers, organized,  not geographically, but in guilds, after the  manner of industrial unionism. These two author-  ities will deal with different classes of questions.  Guild Socialists do not regard the industrial authority  as forming part of the State, for they contend  that it is the essence of the State to be geographical;  but the industrial authority will resemble the present  State in the fact that it will have coercive powers,  and that its decrees will be enforced, when necessary.  It is to be suspected that Syndicalists also, much as  they object to the existing State, would not object  to coercion of individuals in an industry by the  Trade Union in that industry. Government within  the Trade Union would probably be quite as strict  as State government is now. In saying this we are  assuming that the theoretical Anarchism of Syndicalist  leaders would not survive accession to power,  but I am afraid experience shows that this is not a  very hazardous assumption.    Among all these different views, the one which  raises the deepest issue is the Anarchist contention  that all coercion by the community is unnecessary.  Like most of the things that Anarchists say, there  is much more to be urged in support of this view  than most people would suppose at first sight. Kropotkin,  who is its ablest exponent, points out how  much has been achieved already by the method of free  agreement. He does not wish to abolish government  in the sense of collective decisions: what he does wish  to abolish is the system by which a decision is en-  forced upon those who oppose it.[48] The whole system  of representative government and majority rule is  to him a bad thing.[49] He points to such instances  as the agreements among the different railway systems  of the Continent for the running of through  expresses and for co-operation generally. He points  out that in such cases the different companies or  authorities concerned each appoint a delegate, and that  the delegates suggest a basis of agreement, which has  to be subsequently ratified by each of the bodies ap-  pointing them. The assembly of delegates has no  coercive power whatever, and a majority can do  nothing against a recalcitrant minority. Yet this has  not prevented the conclusion of very elaborate systems  of agreements. By such methods, so Anarchists  contend, the USEFUL functions of government can be  carried out without any coercion. They maintain  that the usefulness of agreement is so patent as to  make co-operation certain if once the predatory  motives associated with the present system of private  property were removed.      [48] ``On the other hand, the STATE has also been confused with  GOVERNMENT. As there can be no State without government, it  has been sometimes said that it is the absence of government,  and not the abolition of the State, that should be the aim.    ``It seems to me, however, that State and government represent  two ideas of a different kind. The State idea implies quite  another idea to that of government. It not only includes the  existence of a power placed above society, but also a territorial  concentration and a concentration of many functions of the life  of society in the hands of a few or even of all. It implies new  relations among the members of society.    ``This characteristic distinction, which perhaps escapes  notice at first sight, appears clearly when the origin of the State  is studied.'' Kropotkin, ``The State.'' p. 4.    [49] Representative government has accomplished its historical  mission; it has given a mortal blow to Court-rule; and by  its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions.  But, to see in it the government of the future Socialist society,  is to commit a gross error. Each economical phase of life  implies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the  very basis of the present economical life--private property--  without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political  organization. Life already shows in which direction the change  will be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but  in resorting to free organization and free federation in all those  branches which are now considered as attributes of the State.''  Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism,'' pp. 28-29.      Attractive as this view is, I cannot resist the  conclusion that it results from impatience and  represents the attempt to find a short-cut toward the  ideal which all humane people desire.    Let us begin with the question of private crime.[50]  Anarchists maintain that the criminal is manufactured  by bad social conditions and would disappear  in such a world as they aim at creating.[51] No doubt  there is a great measure of truth in this view. There  would be little motive to robbery, for example, in an  Anarchist world, unless it were organized on a large  scale by a body of men bent on upsetting the Anarchist  regime. It may also be conceded that impulses  toward criminal violence could be very largely eliminated  by a better education. But all such contentions,  it seems to me, have their limitations. To take  an extreme case, we cannot suppose that there would  be no lunatics in an Anarchist community, and some  of these lunatics would, no doubt, be homicidal.  Probably no one would argue that they ought to be  left at liberty. But there are no sharp lines in nature;  from the homicidal lunatic to the sane man  of violent passions there is a continuous gradation.  Even in the most perfect community there will be  men and women, otherwise sane, who will feel an  impulse to commit murder from jealousy. These are  now usually restrained by the fear of punishment,  but if this fear were removed, such murders would  probably become much more common, as may be  seen from the present behavior of certain soldiers  on leave. Moreover, certain kinds of conduct arouse  public hostility, and would almost inevitably lead to  lynching, if no other recognized method of punishment  existed. There is in most men a certain natural  vindictiveness, not always directed against the worst  members of the community. For example, Spinoza  was very nearly murdered by the mob because he was  suspected of undue friendliness to France at a time  when Holland was at war with that country. Apart  from such cases, there would be the very real danger  of an organized attempt to destroy Anarchism  and revive ancient oppressions. Is it to be supposed,  for example, that Napoleon, if he had been born into  such a community as Kropotkin advocates, would  have acquiesced tamely in a world where his genius  could find no scope? I cannot see what should prevent  a combination of ambitious men forming themselves  into a private army, manufacturing their own  munitions, and at last enslaving the defenseless citizens,  who had relied upon the inherent attractiveness  of liberty.

To begin with, they were  soundly beaten in the semi-final for the House football cup by  Allardyce's lot. With Drummond away, there was none to mark the captain  of the School team at half, and Allardyce had raced through in a manner  that must have compensated him to a certain extent for the poor time he  had had in first fifteen matches. The game had ended in a Seymourite  defeat by nineteen points to five.    Nor had the Boxing left the house in a better position. Linton fought  pluckily in the Light-Weights, but went down before Stanning, after  beating a representative of Templar's. Mill did not show up well in the  Heavy-Weights, and was defeated in his first bout. Seymour's were  reduced to telling themselves how different it all would have been if  Drummond had been there.    Sheen watched the Light-Weight contests, and nearly danced with  irritation. He felt that he could have eaten Stanning. The man was  quick with his left, but he couldn't _box_. He hadn't a notion of  side-stepping, and the upper-cut appeared to be entirely outside his  range. He would like to see him tackle Francis.    Sheen thought bitterly of Drummond. Why on earth couldn't he have given  him a chance. It was maddening.    The Fives carried on the story. Menzies was swamped by a Day's man. He  might just as well have stayed away altogether. The star of Seymour's  was very low on the horizon.    And then the house scored its one success. The headmaster announced it  in the Hall after prayers in his dry, unemotional way.    \"I have received the list of marks,\" he said, \"from the examiners for  the Gotford Scholarship.\" He paused. Sheen felt a sudden calm triumph  flood over him. Somehow, intuitively, he knew that he had won. He  waited without excitement for the next words.    \"Out of a possible thousand marks, Sheen, who wins the scholarship,  obtained seven hundred and one, Stanning six hundred and four,  Wilson....\"    Sheen walked out of the Hall in the unique position of a Gotford winner  with only one friend to congratulate him. Jack Bruce was the one. The  other six hundred and thirty-three members of the school made no  demonstration.    There was a pleasant custom at Seymour's of applauding at tea any  Seymourite who had won distinction, and so shed a reflected glory on  the house. The head of the house would observe, \"Well played,  So-and-So!\" and the rest of the house would express their emotion in  the way that seemed best to them, to the subsequent exultation of the  local crockery merchant, who had generally to supply at least a dozen  fresh cups and plates to the house after one of these occasions. When  it was for getting his first eleven or first fifteen cap that the lucky  man was being cheered, the total of breakages sometimes ran into the  twenties.    Rigby, good, easy man, was a little doubtful as to what course to  pursue in the circumstances. Should he give the signal? After all, the  fellow _had_ won the Gotford. It was a score for the house, and  they wanted all the scores they could get in these lean years. Perhaps,  then, he had better.    \"Well played, Sheen,\" said he.    There was a dead silence. A giggle from the fags' table showed that the  comedy of the situation was not lost on the young mind.    The head of the house looked troubled. This was awfully awkward.    \"Well played, Sheen,\" he said again.    \"Don't mention it, Rigby,\" said the winner of the Gotford politely,  looking up from his plate.          XVIII    MR BEVAN MAKES A SUGGESTION      When one has been working hard with a single end in view, the arrival  and departure of the supreme moment is apt to leave a feeling of  emptiness, as if life had been drained of all its interest, and left  nothing sufficiently exciting to make it worth doing. Horatius, as he  followed his plough on a warm day over the corn land which his  gratified country bestowed on him for his masterly handling of the  traffic on the bridge, must sometimes have felt it was a little tame.  The feeling is far more acute when one has been unexpectedly baulked in  one's desire for action. Sheen, for the first few days after he  received Drummond's brief note, felt that it was useless for him to try  to do anything. The Fates were against him. In stories, as Mr Anstey  has pointed out, the hero is never long without his chance of  retrieving his reputation. A mad bull comes into the school grounds,  and he alone (the hero, not the bull) is calm. Or there is a fire, and  whose is that pale and gesticulating form at the upper window? The  bully's, of course. And who is that climbing nimbly up the Virginia  creeper? Why, the hero. Who else? Three hearty cheers for the plucky  hero.    But in real life opportunities of distinguishing oneself are less  frequent.    Sheen continued his visits to the \"Blue Boar\", but more because he  shrank from telling Joe Bevan that all his trouble had been for  nothing, than because he had any definite object in view. It was bitter  to listen to the eulogies of the pugilist, when all the while he knew  that, as far as any immediate results were concerned, it did not really  matter whether he boxed well or feebly. Some day, perhaps, as Mr Bevan  was fond of pointing out when he approached the subject of  disadvantages of boxing, he might meet a hooligan when he was crossing  a field with his sister; but he found that but small consolation. He  was in the position of one who wants a small sum of ready money, and is  told that, in a few years, he may come into a fortune. By the time he  got a chance of proving himself a man with his hands, he would be an  Old Wrykinian. He was leaving at the end of the summer term.    Jack Bruce was sympathetic, and talked more freely than was his wont.    \"I can't understand it,\" he said. \"Drummond always seemed a good sort.  I should have thought he would have sent you in for the house like a  shot. Are you sure you put it plainly in your letter? What did you  say?\"    Sheen repeated the main points of his letter.    \"Did you tell him who had been teaching you?\"    \"No. I just said I'd been boxing lately.\"    \"Pity,\" said Jack Bruce. \"If you'd mentioned that it was Joe who'd been  training you, he would probably have been much more for it. You see, he  couldn't know whether you were any good or not from your letter. But if  you'd told him that Joe Bevan and Hunt both thought you good, he'd have  seen there was something in it.\"    \"It never occurred to me. Like a fool, I was counting on the thing so  much that it didn't strike me there would be any real difficulty in  getting him to see my point. Especially when he got mumps and couldn't  go in himself. Well, it can't be helped now.\"    And the conversation turned to the prospects of Jack Bruce's father in  the forthcoming election, the polling for which had just begun.    \"I'm busy now,\" said Bruce. \"I'm not sure that I shall be able to do  much sparring with you for a bit.\"    \"My dear chap, don't let me--\"    \"Oh, it's all right, really. Taking you to the 'Blue Boar' doesn't land  me out of my way at all. Most of the work lies round in this direction.  I call at cottages, and lug oldest inhabitants to the poll. It's rare  sport.\"    \"Does your pater know?\"    \"Oh, yes. He rots me about it like anything, but, all the same, I  believe he's really rather bucked because I've roped in quite a dozen  voters who wouldn't have stirred a yard if I hadn't turned up. That's  where we're scoring. Pedder hasn't got a car yet, and these old rotters  round here aren't going to move out of their chairs to go for a ride in  an ordinary cart. But they chuck away their crutches and hop into a  motor like one o'clock.\"    \"It must be rather a rag,\" said Sheen.    The car drew up at the door of the \"Blue Boar\". Sheen got out and ran  upstairs to the gymnasium. Joe Bevan was sparring a round with Francis.  He watched them while he changed, but without the enthusiasm of which  he had been conscious on previous occasions. The solid cleverness of  Joe Bevan, and the quickness and cunning of the bantam-weight, were as  much in evidence as before, but somehow the glamour and romance which  had surrounded them were gone. He no longer watched eagerly to pick up  the slightest hint from these experts. He felt no more interest than he  would have felt in watching a game of lawn tennis. He _had_ been  keen. Since his disappointment with regard to the House Boxing he had  become indifferent.    Joe Bevan noticed this before he had been boxing with him a minute.    \"Hullo, sir,\" he said, \"what's this? Tired today? Not feeling well? You  aren't boxing like yourself, not at all you aren't. There's no weight  behind 'em. You're tapping. What's the matter with your feet, too? You  aren't getting about as quickly as I should like to see. What have you  been doing to yourself?\"    \"Nothing that I know of,\" said Sheen. \"I'm sorry I'm so rotten. Let's  have another try.\"    The second try proved as unsatisfactory as the first. He was listless,  and his leads and counters lacked conviction.    Joe Bevan, who identified himself with his pupils with that  thoroughness which is the hall-mark of the first-class boxing  instructor, looked so pained at his sudden loss of form, that Sheen  could not resist the temptation to confide in him. After all, he must  tell him some time.    \"The fact is,\" he said, as they sat on the balcony overlooking the  river, waiting for Jack Bruce to return with his car, \"I've had a bit  of a sickener.\"    \"I thought you'd got sick of it,\" said Mr Bevan. \"Well, have a bit of a  rest.\"    \"I don't mean that I'm tired of boxing,\" Sheen hastened to explain.  \"After all the trouble you've taken with me, it would be a bit thick if  I chucked it just as I was beginning to get on. It isn't that. But you  know how keen I was on boxing for the house?\"    Joe Bevan nodded.    \"Did you get beat?\"    \"They wouldn't let me go"]]]
