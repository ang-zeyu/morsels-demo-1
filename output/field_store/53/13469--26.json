There remained four most important objects, to which the  anxious attention of all Abolitionists was now directed.    _First_,--The law had been passed, forced upon the Planters, the  Traders, and the Parliament, by the voice of the people; and there was a  necessity for keeping a watchful eye over its execution.    _Secondly_,--The statute, however rigorously it might be enforced, left,  of course, the whole amount of the Foreign Slave traffic untouched, and  it was infinitely to be desired that means should be adopted for  extending our Abolition to other nations.    _Thirdly_,--Some compensation was due to Africa, for the countless  miseries which our criminal conduct had for ages inflicted upon her, and  strict justice, to say nothing of common humanity and Christian charity,  demanded that every means should be used for aiding in the progress of  her civilization, and effacing as far as possible the dreadful marks  which had been left upon her by our crimes.    _Lastly,_--Many of those whom we had transported by fraud and violence  from their native country, and still more of the descendants of others  who had fallen a sacrifice to our cruelties, and perished in the course  of nature, slaves in a foreign land, remained to suffer the dreadful  evils of West India bondage. It seemed to follow, that the earliest  opportunity consistent with their own condition, should be taken to free  those unhappy beings, the victims of our sordid cruelty; and all the  more to be pitied, as we were all the more to be blamed, because one  result of our transgression was the having placed them in so unnatural a  position, that their enemies might seem to be furnished with an argument  more plausible than sound, drawn from the Negro's supposed unfitness for  immediate emancipation.    In order to promote these four great objects, a society was formed in  May 1807, called the African Institution, and although, at first, its  labours were chiefly directed to the portion of the subject relating to  Africa, by degrees, as the extinction of the British Slave Trade was  accomplished, its care was chiefly bestowed on West India matters, which  were more within the power of this country than the slave traffic, still  carried on by foreign nations. But it is necessary in the first place,  to recite the measures by which our own share in that enormous crime was  surrendered, and the stigma partially obliterated, which it had brought  upon our national character, Thomas Clarkson bore a forward and  important part in all these useful and virtuous proceedings. His health  was now, by rest among the Lakes of Westmoreland for several years,  comparatively restored and his mind once more bent itself to the  accomplishment of the grand object; of his life, we may he permitted  reverently to suggest, the end of his existence.    Mr. Stephen and others, at first, deemed the certainty of the Act passed  in March 1807, being evaded under the stimulus, and the insurance  against capture afforded by the enormous profits of the traffic, so  clear, that they expected the law to become, almost from the time of its  being enacted, a dead letter. There soon appeared the strongest reasons  to concur in this opinion, the result of long and close observation in  the Islands where Mr. Stephen had passed part of his life. The  slave-dealers knew the risk of penalty and forfeiture which they ran;  but they also knew that if one voyage in three or four was successful,  they were abundantly remunerated for all their losses; and, therefore,  they were no more restrained by the Abolition Act, than by any moderate  increase of the cost or the risk attending their wicked adventures. This  was sure, to be the case, as long as the law only treated slavetrading  as a contraband commerce, subjecting those who drove it to nothing but  pecuniary penalties. But it was equally evident that the same persons  who made these calculations of profit and risk, while they only could  lose the ship or the money by a seizure, would hesitate before they  encountered the hazard of being tried as for a crime. And, surely, if  ever these was an act which deserved to be declared felony, and dealt  with as such, it was this of slave-trading. Accordingly, in 1810, Mr.  Brougham, then a member of the House of Commons, in moving an address to  the crown, (which was unanimously agreed to,) for more vigorous measures  against the traffic, both British and Foreign, gave notice of the Bill,  which he next year carried through Parliament, and which declared the  traffic to be a felony, punishable with transportation. Some years  afterwards it was by another Act made capital, under the name of Piracy,  but this has since been repealed. Several convictions have taken place  under the former Act, (of 1811,) and there cannot be the least doubt  that the law has proved effectual, and that the Slave Trade has long  ceased to exist as far as the British dominions are concerned.    That foreign states continue shamefully to carry it on, is no less  certain. There are yearly transported to Cuba and Brazil, above 100,000  unhappy beings, by the two weakest nations in Europe, and these two most  entirely subject to the influence and even direct control of England.  The inevitable consequence is, that more misery is now inflicted on  Africa by the criminals, gently called Slave-traders, of these two  guilty nations, than if there were no treaties for the abolition of the  traffic. The number required is always carried over, and hence, as many  perish by a miserable death in escaping from the cruisers, as reach  their destination. The recitals of horror which have been made to  Parliament and the country on this dreadful subject, are enough to  curdle the blood in the veins and heart of any one endued with the  common feelings of humanity. The whole system of prevention, or rather  of capture, after the crime has been committed, seems framed with a view  to exasperate the evils of the infernal traffic, to scourge Africa with  more intolerable torments, and to make human blood be spilt like water.  Our cruisers, are excited to an active discharge of their duty, by the  benefit of sharing in the price fetched when the captured ship is  condemned and sold; but this is a small sum, indeed, compared with the  rich reward of head-money held out, being so much for every slave taken  on board. It is thus made the direct interest of these cruisers, that  the vessels should have their human cargoes on board, rather than be  prevented from shipping them. True, this vile policy may prove less  mischievous where no treaty exists, giving a right to seize when there  are no slaves in the vessel, because here a slave ship is suffered to  pass, how clear soever her destination might be; yet, even here, the  inducement to send in boats, and seize as soon as a slave or two may be  on board, is removed, and the cruiser is told, \"only let all these  wretched beings be torn from their country, and safely lodged in the  vessel's hold, and your reward is great and sure.\" Then, whenever there  is an outfit clause, that is a power to seize vessels fitted for the  traffic, this mischievous plan tends directly to make the cruiser let  the slaver make ready and put to sea, or it has no tendency or meaning  at all. Accordingly, the course is for the cruiser to stand out to sea,  and not allow herself to be seen in the offing--the crime is  consummated--the slaves are stowed away--the pirate--captain weighs  anchor--the pirate-vessel freighted with victims, and manned by  criminals fares forth--the cruiser, the British cruiser, gives  chace--and then begin those scenes of horror, surpassing all that the  poet ever conceived, whose theme was the torments of the damned and the  wickedness of the fiends. Casks are filled with the slave, and in these  they are stowed away; or to lighten the vessel, they are flung overboard  by the score; sometimes they are flung overboard in casks, that the  chasing ship may be detained by endeavours to pick them up; the dying  and the dead strew the deck; women giving birth to the fruit of the  womb, amidst the corpses of their husbands and their children; and  other, yet worse and nameless atrocities, fill up the terrible picture,  of impotent justice and triumphant guilt. But the guilt is not all  Spanish and Portuguese. The English Government can enforce its demands  on the puny cabinets of Madrid and Lisbon, scarce conscious of a  substantive existence, in all that concerns our petty interests:  wherever justice and mercy to mankind demand our interference, there our  voice sinks within us, and no sound is uttered. That any treaty without  an outfit clause should be suffered to exist between powers so situated,  is an outrage upon all justice, all reason, all common sense. But one  thing is certain, that unless we are to go further, we have gone too  far, and must in mercy to hapless Africa retrace our steps. Unless we  really put the traffic down with a strong hand, and instantly, we must  instantly repeal the treaties that pretended to abolish it, for these  exacerbate the evil a hundred fold, and are ineffectual to any one  purpose but putting money into the pockets of our men of war. The fact  is as unquestionable, as it is appalling, that all our anxious  endeavours to extinguish the Foreign Slave Trade, have ended in making  it incomparably worse than it was before we pretended to put it down;  that owing to our efforts, there are thrice the number of slaves yearly  torn from Africa; and that wholly because of our efforts, two thirds of  these are murdered on the high seas and in the holds of the pirate  vessels.    It is said, that when these scenes were described to an indignant nation  last session of Parliament, the actual effects of this bad system were  denied, though its tendency could not be disputed.    It was averred that \"no British seaman could be capable of neglecting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"creeping things,    That fain would have scratched up my buried gold.

The comedy of _Timon_, which was chiefly taken from Lucian, and one,  if not more, of Boiardo's prose translations from other ancients, were  written at the request of Duke Ercole, who was a great lover of dramatic  versions of this kind, and built a theatre for their exhibition at an  enormous expense. These prose translations consist of Apuleius's  _Golden Ass_, Herodotus (the Duke's order), the _Golden Ass_ of Lucian,  Xenophon's _Cyropaedia_ (not printed), Emilius Probus (also not printed,  and supposed to be Cornelius Nepos), and Riccobaldo's credulous _Historia  Universalis_, with additions. It seems not improbable, that he also  translated Homer and Diodorus; and Doni the bookmaker asserts, that he  wrote a work called the _Testamento dell' Anima_ (the Soul's Testament)  but Mr. Panizzi calls Doni \"a barefaced impostor;\" and says, that as  the work is mentioned by nobody else, we may be \"certain that it never  existed,\" and that the title was \"a forgery of the impudent priest.\"    Nothing else of Boiardo's writing is known to exist, but a collection  of official letters in the archives of Modena, which, according to  Tiraboschi, are of no great importance. It is difficult to suppose,  however, that they would not be worth looking at. The author of the  _Orlando Innamorato_ could hardly write, even upon the driest matters  of government, with the aridity of a common clerk. Some little lurking  well-head of character or circumstance, interesting to readers of a later  age, would probably break through the barren ground. Perhaps the letters  went counter to some of the good Jesuit's theology.    Boiardo's prose translations from the authors of antiquity are so scarce,  that Mr. Panizzi himself, a learned and miscellaneous reader, says he  never saw them. I am willing to get the only advantage in my power  over an Italian critic, by saying that I have had some of them in my  hands,--brought there by the pleasant chances of the bookstalls; but I  can give no account of them. A modern critic, quoted by this gentleman  (Gamba, _Testi di Lingua_), calls the version of Apuleius \"rude and  curious;\"[3] but adds, that it contains \"expressions full of liveliness  and propriety.\" By \"rude\" is probably meant obsolete, and comparatively  unlearned. Correctness of interpretation and classical nicety of style  (as Mr. Panizzi observes) were the growths of a later age.    Nothing is told us by his biographers of the person of Boiardo: and it is  not safe to determine a man's _physique_ from his writings, unless  perhaps with respect to the greater or less amount of his animal spirits;  for the able-bodied may write effeminately, and the feeblest supply the  defect of corporal stamina with spiritual. Portraits, however, seem to be  extant. Mazzuchelli discovered that a medal had been struck in the  poet's honour; and in the castle of Scandiano (though \"the halls where  knights and ladies listened to the adventures of the Paladin are now  turned into granaries,\" and Orlando himself has nearly disappeared  from the outside, where he was painted in huge dimensions as  if \"entrusted with the wardenship\") there was a likeness of Boiardo  executed by Niccolo dell' Abate, together with the principal events of  the _Orlando Innamorato_ and the _AEneid_.But part of these  paintings (Mr. Panizzi tells us) were destroyed, and part removed from  the castle to Modena\" to save them from certain loss;\" and he does not  add whether the portrait was among the latter.    From anecdotes, however, and from the poet's writings, we gather the  nature of the man; and this appears to have been very amiable. There is  an aristocratic tone in his poem, when speaking of the sort of people of  whom the mass of soldiers is wont to consist; and Foscolo says, that the  Count of Scandiano writes like a feudal lord. But common soldiers are not  apt to be the _elite_ of mankind; neither do we know with how goodnatured  a smile the mention of them may have been accompanied. People often give  a tone to what they read, more belonging to their own minds than the  author's. All the accounts left us of Boiardo, hostile as well as  friendly, prove him to have been an indulgent and popular man. According  to one, he was fond of making personal inquiries among its inhabitants  into the history of his native place; and he requited them so generously  for their information, that it was customary with them to say, when they  wished good fortune to one another, \"Heaven send Boiardo to your house!\"  There is said to have been a tradition at Scandiano, that having tried in  vain one day, as he was riding out, to discover a name for one of his  heroes, expressive of his lofty character, and the word _Rodamonte_  coming into his head, he galloped back with a pleasant ostentation to his  castle, crying it out aloud, and ordering the bells of the place to be  rung in its holiour; to the astonishment of the good people, who took  \"Rodamonte\" for some newly-discovered saint. His friend Paganelli of  Modena, who wrote a Latin poem on the _Empire of Cupid_, extolled  the Governor of Reggio for ranking among the deity's most generous  vassals,--one who, in spite of his office of magistrate, looked with  an indulgent eye on errors to which himself was liable, and who was  accustomed to prefer the study of love-verses to that of the law. The  learned lawyer, his countryman Panciroli, probably in resentment, as  Panizzi says, of this preference, accused him of an excess of benignity,  and of being fitter for writing poems than punishing ill deeds; and in  truth, as the same critic observes, \"he must have been considered crazy  by the whole tribe of lawyers of that age,\" if it be true that he  anticipated the opinion of Beccaria, in thinking that no crime ought to  be punished with death.    The great work of this interesting and accomplished person, the _Orlando  Innamorato_, is an epic romance, founded on the love of the great Paladin  for the peerless beauty Angelica, whose name has enamoured the ears of  posterity. The poem introduces us to the pleasantest paths in that track  of reading in which Milton has told us that his \"young feet delighted to  wander.\" Nor did he forsake it in his age.      \"Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,    When Agrican with all his northern powers    Besieged Albracca, as romances tell,    The city of Gallaphrone, from whence to win    The fairest of her sex, Angelica.\"                                                _Paradise Regained._    The _Orlando Innamorato_ may be divided into three principal  portions:-the search for Angelica by Orlando and her other lovers; the  siege of her father's city Albracca by the Tartars; and that of Paris  and Charlemagne by the Moors. These, however, are all more or less  intermingled, and with the greatest art; and there are numerous episodes  of a like intertexture. The fairies and fairy-gardens of British romance,  and the fabulous glories of the house of Este, now proclaimed for the  first time, were added by the author to the enchantments of Pulci,  together with a pervading elegance; and had the poem been completed, we  were to have heard again of the traitor Gan of Maganza, for the purpose  of exalting the imaginary founder of that house, Ruggero.    This resuscitation of the Helen of antiquity, under a more seducing form,  was an invention of Boiardo's; so was the subjection of Charles's hero  Orlando to the passion of love; so, besides the heroine and her name,  was that of other interesting characters with beautiful names, which  afterwards figured in Ariosto. This inventive faculty is indeed so  conspicuous in every part of the work, on small as well as great  occasions, in fairy-adventures and those of flesh and blood, that  although the author appears to have had both his loves and his fairies  suggested to him by our romances of Arthur and the Round Table, it  constitutes, next to the pervading elegance above mentioned, his chief  claim to our admiration. Another of his merits is a certain tender  gallantry, or rather an honest admixture of animal passion with  spiritual, also the precursor of the like ingenuous emotions in Ariosto;  and he furthermore set his follower the example, not only of good  breeding, but of a constant heroical cheerfulness, looking with faith on  nature. Pulci has a constant cheerfulness, but not with so much grace and  dignity. Foscolo has remarked, that Boiardo's characters even surpass  those of Ariosto in truth and variety, and that his Angelica more engages  our feelings;[4] to which I will venture to add, that if his style is  less strong and complete, it never gives us a sense of elaboration. I  should take Boiardo to have been the healthier man, though of a less  determined will than Ariosto, and perhaps, on the whole, less robust.  You find in Boiardo almost which Ariosto perfected,--chivalry, battles,  combats, loves and graces, passions, enchantments, classical and romantic  fable, eulogy, satire, mirth, pathos, philosophy. It is like the first  sketch of a great picture, not the worse in"]]]
