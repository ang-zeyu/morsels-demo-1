My  First Lieutenant, the Navigator and the Engineer have bunks in a room  together, and then we have a small officers' mess.    On this job up here, as we are not to return to Germany for supplies,  and, consequently, I should say we may have to live on what we can get  out of steamers, I don't propose to use my torpedoes unless I meet a  warship or an exceptionally large steamer.    The gun's the thing, as Arnauld de la Perriere has proved in the  Mediterranean; but half the fellows won't follow his example, simply  because they don't realize that it's no use employing the gun unless it  is used accurately, and good shooting only comes after long drill.    I have impressed this fact on my gun crew, and particularly the two  gun-layers, and I make Voigtman (my young First Lieutenant) take the  crew through their loading drill twice a day, together with practice of  rapid manning of the gun after a \"surface\" or rapid abandonment of the  gun should the diving alarms sound in the middle of practice. I have  also impressed on Voigtman that I consider that he is the gun control  officer, and that I expect him to make the efficient working of the gun  his main consideration.    As regards the crew, they are the usual mixed crowd that one gets  nowadays: half of them are old sailors, the others recruits and new  arrivals from the Fleet. My main business at the moment is to get the  youngsters into shape, and for this purpose I have been doing a number  of crash dives. It also gives me an opportunity of getting used to the  boat's peculiarities under water. She seems to have a tendency to  become tail-heavy, but this may be due to bad trimming.    Voigtman has been in U.B.43 for nine months, and seems a capable  officer. Socially, I don't think he can boast of much descent, but he  has no airs, and treats me with pleasing respect, apart from service  considerations.           *       *       *       *       *    A very awkward accident took place this morning, which resulted in  severe injury to Johann Wiener, my second coxswain.    A party of men under his direction were engaged in shifting the stern  torpedo from its tube, in order to replace it with a spare torpedo, as  I never allow any of my torpedoes to stay in the tube for more than a  week at a time owing to corrosion. The torpedo which had been in the  tube had been launched back and was on the floor plates.    The spare torpedo, destined for the vacant tube, was hanging overhead,  when without any warning the hook on the lifting band fractured, and  the 1,000 kilogrammes' mass of metal crashed down.    Wonderful to relate, no one was killed, but two men were badly bruised,  and Wiener has been very seriously injured. He was standing astride the  spare torpedo, and his right leg was extremely badly crushed, mostly  below the knee.    Unfortunately it took about ten minutes to release him from his  position of terrible agony. I should have expected him to faint, but he  did not. His face went dead white, and he began to sweat freely, but  otherwise endured his ordeal with praiseworthy fortitude.    [Illustration: \"The 1,000 kilogrammes of metal crashed down.\"]    [Illustration: \"Good-bye! Steer west for America!\"]    [Illustration: \"It is a snug anchorage and here I intend to remain.\"]    I am now confronted with a perplexing situation. I cannot take him back  to Germany; I cannot even leave my station and proceed south to any of  the Norwegian ports. If I could find a neutral steamer with a doctor on  board, I would tranship him to her; but the chances of this God-send  materializing are a thousand to one in these latitudes. If I sighted a  hospital ship I would close her, but as far as I know at present there  are no hospital ships running up here. The chances of outside  assistance may therefore be reckoned as nil. Wiener's hope of life  depends on me, and I cannot make up my mind to take the step which  sooner or later must be taken--that is to say, amputation.    It is a curious fact, but true, nevertheless, that although, as a  result of the war, men's lives, considered in quantity, seem of little  importance, when it comes to the individual case, a personal contact, a  man's life assumes all its pre-war importance.    I feel acutely my responsibility in this matter. I see from his papers  that he is a married man with a family; this seems to make it worse. I  feel that a whole chain of people depend on me.           *       *       *       *       *    Since I wrote the above words this morning, Wiener has taken a decided  turn for the worse.    I have been reading the \"Medical Handbook,\" with reference to the  remarks on amputation, gangrene, etc., and I have also been examining  his leg. The poor devil is in great pain, and there is no doubt that  mortification has set in, as was indeed inevitable. I have decided that  he must have his last chance, and that at 8 p.m. to-night I will  endeavour to amputate.          _Midnight_.      I have done it--only partially successful.           *       *       *       *       *    Last night, in accordance with my decision, I operated on Wiener.  Voigtman assisted me. It was a terrible business, but I think it  desirable to record the details whilst they are fresh in my memory, as  a Court of Inquiry may be held later on. Voigtman and I spent the whole  afternoon in the study of such meagre details on the subject as are  available in the \"Medical Handbook.\" We selected our knives and a saw  and sterilized them; we also disinfected our hands.    At 7.45 I dived the boat to sixty metres, at which depth the boat was  steady. We had done our best with the wardroom-table, and upon this the  patient was placed. I decided to amputate about four inches above the  knee, where the flesh still seemed sound. I considered it impracticable  to administer an anaesthetic, owing to my absolute inexperience in this  matter.    Three men held the patient down, as with a firm incision I began the  work. The sawing through the bone was an agonizing procedure, and I  needed all my resolution to complete the task. Up to this stage all had  gone as well as could be expected, when I suddenly went through the  last piece of bone and cut deep into the flesh on the other side. An  instantaneous gush of blood took place, and I realized that I had  unexpectedly severed the popliteal artery, before Voigtman, who was  tying the veins, was ready to deal with it.    I endeavoured to staunch the deadly flow by nipping the vein between my  thumb and forefinger, whilst Voigtman hastily tried to tie it. Thinking  it was tied, I released it, and alas! the flow at once started again;  once more I seized the vein, and once again Voigtman tried to tie it.  Useless--we could not stop the blood. He would undoubtedly have bled to  death before our eyes, had not Voigtman cauterized the place with an  electric soldering-iron which was handy.    Much shaken, I completed the amputation, and we dressed the stump as  well as we could.    At the moment of writing he is still alive, but as white as snow; he  must have lost litres of blood through that artery.          9 _p.m._      Wiener died two hours ago. I should say the immediate cause of death  was shock and loss of blood. I did my best.           *       *       *       *       *    We have been out on this extended patrol area seven days, but not a  wisp of smoke greets our eyes.    Nothing but sea, sea, sea. Oh, how monotonous it is! I cannot make out  where the shipping has got to. Tomorrow I am going to close the North  Cape again. I think everything must be going inside me. I am too far  out here.           *       *       *       *       *    The North Cape bears due east. Nothing afloat in sight. Where the devil  can all the shipping be? In ten days' time I am due to meet my supply  ship; meanwhile I think I'll have to take another cast out, of three  hundred miles or so.           *       *       *       *       *    Nothing in sight, nothing, nothing.    The barometer falling fast and we are in for a gale. I have decided to  make the coast again, as I don't want to fail to turn up punctually at  the rendezvous.           *       *       *       *       *    In the Standarak-Landholm Fjord--thank heavens.    Heavens! we have had a time. We were still two hundred and fifty miles  from the coast when we were caught by the gale. And a gale up here is a  gale, and no second thoughts about it. To say it blew with the force of  ten thousand devils is to understate the case. The sea came on to us in  huge foaming rollers like waves of attacking infantry intent on  overwhelming us.    We struggled east at about three knots. But she stuck it magnificently.  Low scudding clouds obscured the sky and came like a procession of  ghosts from the north-east. Sun observations were impossible for two  reasons. Firstly, no one could get on deck; secondly, there was no  visible sun. This lasted for three days, at the end of which time we  had only the vaguest idea as to where we were.    The gale then blew out, but, contrary to all expectations, was  succeeded by a most abominable fog, thick and white like cotton-wool.  These were hardly ideal conditions under which to close a rocky and  unknown coast, but it had to be done. The trouble was that it was  entirely useless taking soundings, as the twenty-metre depth-line on  the chart went right up to the land. We crept slowly eastwards, till,  when by dead reckoning we were ten miles inside the coast, the  Navigator accidentally leant on the whistle lever; this action on his  part probably saved the ship, as an immediate echo answered the blast.  In an instant we were going full-speed astern. We altered course  sixteen points and proceeded ten miles westerly, where we lay on and  off the coast all night, cursing the fog.    Next day it lifted, and we spent the whole time trying to find the  entrance to the S. Landholm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#19)"],[1,"when an  army was betrayed abroad, when seditions were raised at home; in short,  when the public was faithlessly administered and the majesty of the  Roman People was debased: these were actions, and actions were punished,  but words were free. Augustus was the first who brought libels under the  penalties of this wrested law, incensed as he was by the insolence of  Cassius Severus, who had in his writings wantonly defamed men and ladies  of illustrious quality. Tiberius too afterwards, when Pompeius Macer,  the Praetor, consulted him \"whether process should be granted upon  this law?\" answered, \"That the laws must be executed.\" He also  was exasperated by satirical verses written by unknown authors and  dispersed; exposing his cruelty, his pride, and his mind naturally  alienated from his mother.    It will be worth while to relate here the pretended crimes charged upon  Falanius and Rubrius, two Roman knights of small fortunes; that hence  may be seen from what beginnings, and by how much dark art of Tiberius,  this grievous mischief crept in; how it was again restrained; how at  last it blazed out and consumed all things. To Falanius was objected  by his accusers, that \"amongst the adorers of Augustus, who went in  fraternities from house to house, he had admitted one Cassius, a mimic  and prostitute; and having sold his gardens, had likewise with them sold  the statue of Augustus.\" The crime imputed to Rubrius was, \"That he had  sworn falsely by the divinity of Augustus.\" When these accusations  were known to Tiberius, he wrote to the consuls, \"That Heaven was not  therefore decreed to his father, that the worship of him might be a  snare to the citizens of Rome; that Cassius, the player, was wont to  assist with others of his profession at the interludes consecrated by  his mother to the memory of Augustus: neither did it affect religion,  that his effigies, like other images of the Gods, were comprehended in  the sale of houses and gardens. As to the false swearing by his name,  it was to be deemed the same as if Rubrius had profaned the name of  Jupiter; but to the Gods belonged the avenging of injuries done to the  Gods.\"    Not long after, Granius Marcellus, Praetor of Bithynia, was charged with  high treason by his own Quaestor, Cepio Crispinus; Romanus Hispo, the  pleader, supporting the charge. This Cepio began a course of life which,  through the miseries of the times and the bold wickedness of men, became  afterwards famous: at first needy and obscure, but of a busy spirit,  he made court to the cruelty of the Prince by occult informations; and  presently, as an open accuser, grew terrible to every distinguished  Roman. This procured him credit with one, hatred from all, and made a  precedent to be followed by others, who from poverty became rich; from  being contemned, dreadful; and in the destruction which they brought  upon others, found at last their own. He accused Marcellus of \"malignant  words concerning Tiberius,\" an inevitable crime! when the accuser,  collecting all the most detestable parts of the Prince's character,  alleged them as the expressions of the accused; for, because they were  true, they were believed to have been spoken. To this, Hispo added,  \"That the statue of Marcellus was by him placed higher than those of the  Caesars; and that, having cut off the head of Augustus, he had in the  room of it set the head of Tiberius.\" This enraged him so, that breaking  silence, he cried, \"He would himself, in this cause, give his vote  explicitly and under the tie of an oath.\" By this he meant to force the  assent of the rest of the Senate. There remained even then some faint  traces of expiring liberty. Hence Cneius Piso asked him, \"In what place,  Caesar, will you choose to give your opinion? If first, I shall have  your example to follow; if last, I fear I may ignorantly dissent from  you.\" The words pierced him, but he bore them, the rather as he was  ashamed of his unwary transport; and he suffered the accused to be  acquitted of high treason. To try him for the public money was referred  to the proper judges.    Nor sufficed it Tiberius to assist in the deliberations of the Senate  only: he likewise sat in the seats of justice; but always on one side,  because he would not dispossess the Praetor of his chair; and by his  presence there, many ordinances were established against the intrigues  and solicitations of the Grandees. But while private justice was thus  promoted, public liberty was overthrown. About this time, Pius Aurelius,  the Senator, whose house, yielding to the pressure of the public road  and aqueducts, had fallen, complained to the Senate and prayed relief:  a suit opposed by the Praetors who managed the treasury; but he was  relieved by Tiberius, who ordered him the price of his house; for he  was fond of being liberal upon honest occasions: a virtue which he long  retained, even after he had utterly abandoned all other virtues. Upon  Propertius Celer, once Praetor, but now desiring leave to resign the  dignity of Senator, as a burden to his poverty, he bestowed a thousand  great sesterces; [Footnote: L8333.] upon ample information, that Celer's  necessities were derived from his father. Others, who attempted the same  thing, he ordered to lay their condition before the Senate; and from  an affectation of severity was thus austere even where he acted with  uprightness. Hence the rest preferred poverty and silence to begging and  relief.    The same year the Tiber, being swelled with continual rains, overflowed  the level parts of the city; and the common destruction of men and  houses followed the returning flood. Hence Asinius Callus moved \"that  the Sibylline books might be consulted.\" Tiberius opposed it, equally  smothering all inquiries whatsoever, whether into matters human or  divine. To Ateius Capito, however, and Lucius Arruntius, was committed  the care of restraining the river within its banks. The provinces of  Achaia and Macedon, praying relief from their public burdens, were for  the present discharged of their Proconsular government, and subjected to  the Emperor's lieutenants. In the entertainment of gladiators at Rome,  Drusus presided: it was exhibited in the name of Germanicus, and his  own; and at it he manifested too much lust of blood, even of the blood  of slaves: a quality terrible to the populace; and hence his father  was said to have reproved him. His own absence from these shows was  variously construed: by some it was ascribed to his impatience of a  crowd; by others to his reserved and solitary genius, and his fear of  an unequal comparison with Augustus, who was wont to be a cheerful  spectator. But, that he thus purposely furnished matter for exposing the  cruelty of his son there, and for raising him popular hate, is what I  would not believe; though this too was asserted.    The dissensions of the theatre, begun last year, broke out now more  violently, with the slaughter of several, not of the people only, but of  the soldiers, with that of a Centurion. Nay, a Tribune of a Praetorian  cohort was wounded, whilst they were securing the magistrates from  insults, and quelling the licentiousness of the rabble. This riot was  canvassed in the Senate, and votes were passing for empowering the  Praetors to whip the players. Haterius Agrippa, Tribune of the People,  opposed it; and was sharply reprimanded by a speech of Asinius Gallus.  Tiberius was silent, and to the Senate allowed these empty apparitions  of liberty. The opposition, however, prevailed, in reverence to the  authority of Augustus; who, upon a certain occasion, had given his  judgment, \"that players were exempt from stripes:\" nor would Tiberius  assume to violate any words of his. To limit the wages of players, and  restrain the licentiousness of their partisans, many decrees were made:  the most remarkable were, \"That no Senator should enter the house of a  pantomime; no Roman Knight attend them abroad; they should show nowhere  but in the theatre; and the Praetors should have power to punish any  insolence in the spectators with exile.\"    The Spaniards were, upon their petition, permitted to build a temple  to Augustus in the colony of Tarragon; an example this for all the  provinces to follow. In answer to the people, who prayed to be relieved  from the _centesima_, a tax of one in the hundred, established at the  end of the civil wars, upon all vendible commodities; Tiberius by an  edict declared, \"That upon this tax depended the fund for maintaining  the army; nor even thus was the Commonwealth equal to the expense, if  before their twentieth year the veterans were dismissed.\" So that  the concessions made them during the late sedition, to discharge  them finally at the end of sixteen years, as they were made through  necessity, were for the future abolished.    It was next proposed to the Senate, by Arruntius and Ateius, whether,  in order to restrain the overflowing of the Tiber, the channels of the  several rivers and lakes by which it was swelled, must not be diverted.  Upon this question the deputies of several cities and colonies were  heard. The Florentines besought, \"that the bed of the Clanis [Footnote:  Chiana.] might not be turned into their river Arnus; [Footnote: Arno.]  for that the same would prove their utter ruin.\" The like plea was urged  by the Interamnates; [Footnote: Terni.] \"since the most fruitful plains  in Italy would be lost, if, according to the project, the Nar, branched  out into rivulets, overflowed them.\" Nor were the Reatinians less  earnest against stopping the outlets of the Lake Velinus into the Nar;  \"otherwise,\" they said, \"it would break over its banks, and stagnate all  the adjacent country; the direction of nature was best in all natural  things: it was she that to rivers had appointed their courses and  discharges, and set them their limits as well as their sources. Regard  too was to be paid to the religion of our"]]]
