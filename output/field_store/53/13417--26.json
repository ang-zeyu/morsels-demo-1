Doggedly he  followed the faint spoor, pausing by day only to kill and eat, and at  night only to sleep and refresh himself.    Occasionally he passed parties of savage warriors; but these he gave a  wide berth, for he was hunting with a purpose that was not to be  distracted by the minor accidents of the trail.    These parties were of the collecting hordes of the Waziri and their  allies which Basuli had scattered his messengers broadcast to summon.  They were marching to a common rendezvous in preparation for an assault  upon the stronghold of Achmet Zek; but to Tarzan they were enemies--he  retained no conscious memory of any friendship for the black men.    It was night when he halted outside the palisaded village of the Arab  raider.  Perched in the branches of a great tree he gazed down upon the  life within the enclosure.  To this place had the spoor led him.  His  quarry must be within; but how was he to find him among so many huts?  Tarzan, although cognizant of his mighty powers, realized also his  limitations.  He knew that he could not successfully cope with great  numbers in open battle.  He must resort to the stealth and trickery of  the wild beast, if he were to succeed.    Sitting in the safety of his tree, munching upon the leg bone of Horta,  the boar, Tarzan waited a favorable opportunity to enter the village.  For awhile he gnawed at the bulging, round ends of the large bone,  splintering off small pieces between his strong jaws, and sucking at  the delicious marrow within; but all the time he cast repeated glances  into the village.  He saw white-robed figures, and half-naked blacks;  but not once did he see one who resembled the stealer of the gems.    Patiently he waited until the streets were deserted by all save the  sentries at the gates, then he dropped lightly to the ground, circled  to the opposite side of the village and approached the palisade.    At his side hung a long, rawhide rope--a natural and more dependable  evolution from the grass rope of his childhood. Loosening this, he  spread the noose upon the ground behind him, and with a quick movement  of his wrist tossed the coils over one of the sharpened projections of  the summit of the palisade.    Drawing the noose taut, he tested the solidity of its hold. Satisfied,  the ape-man ran nimbly up the vertical wall, aided by the rope which he  clutched in both hands.  Once at the top it required but a moment to  gather the dangling rope once more into its coils, make it fast again  at his waist, take a quick glance downward within the palisade, and,  assured that no one lurked directly beneath him, drop softly to the  ground.    Now he was within the village.  Before him stretched a series of tents  and native huts.  The business of exploring each of them would be  fraught with danger; but danger was only a natural factor of each day's  life--it never appalled Tarzan.  The chances appealed to him--the  chances of life and death, with his prowess and his faculties pitted  against those of a worthy antagonist.    It was not necessary that he enter each habitation--through a door, a  window or an open chink, his nose told him whether or not his prey lay  within.  For some time he found one disappointment following upon the  heels of another in quick succession.  No spoor of the Belgian was  discernible. But at last he came to a tent where the smell of the thief  was strong.  Tarzan listened, his ear close to the canvas at the rear,  but no sound came from within.    At last he cut one of the pin ropes, raised the bottom of the canvas,  and intruded his head within the interior.  All was quiet and dark.  Tarzan crawled cautiously within--the scent of the Belgian was strong;  but it was not live scent. Even before he had examined the interior  minutely, Tarzan knew that no one was within it.    In one corner he found a pile of blankets and clothing scattered about;  but no pouch of pretty pebbles.  A careful examination of the balance  of the tent revealed nothing more, at least nothing to indicate the  presence of the jewels; but at the side where the blankets and clothing  lay, the ape-man discovered that the tent wall had been loosened at the  bottom, and presently he sensed that the Belgian had recently passed  out of the tent by this avenue.    Tarzan was not long in following the way that his prey had fled.  The  spoor led always in the shadow and at the rear of the huts and tents of  the village--it was quite evident to Tarzan that the Belgian had gone  alone and secretly upon his mission.  Evidently he feared the  inhabitants of the village, or at least his work had been of such a  nature that he dared not risk detection.    At the back of a native hut the spoor led through a small hole recently  cut in the brush wall and into the dark interior beyond.  Fearlessly,  Tarzan followed the trail.  On hands and knees, he crawled through the  small aperture.  Within the hut his nostrils were assailed by many  odors; but clear and distinct among them was one that half aroused a  latent memory of the past--it was the faint and delicate odor of a  woman.  With the cognizance of it there rose in the breast of the  ape-man a strange uneasiness--the result of an irresistible force which  he was destined to become acquainted with anew--the instinct which  draws the male to his mate.    In the same hut was the scent spoor of the Belgian, too, and as both  these assailed the nostrils of the ape-man, mingling one with the  other, a jealous rage leaped and burned within him, though his memory  held before the mirror of recollection no image of the she to which he  had attached his desire.    Like the tent he had investigated, the hut, too, was empty, and after  satisfying himself that his stolen pouch was secreted nowhere within,  he left, as he had entered, by the hole in the rear wall.    Here he took up the spoor of the Belgian, followed it across the  clearing, over the palisade, and out into the dark jungle beyond.          15    The Flight of Werper      After Werper had arranged the dummy in his bed, and sneaked out into  the darkness of the village beneath the rear wall of his tent, he had  gone directly to the hut in which Jane Clayton was held captive.    Before the doorway squatted a black sentry.  Werper approached him  boldly, spoke a few words in his ear, handed him a package of tobacco,  and passed into the hut.  The black grinned and winked as the European  disappeared within the darkness of the interior.    The Belgian, being one of Achmet Zek's principal lieutenants, might  naturally go where he wished within or without the village, and so the  sentry had not questioned his right to enter the hut with the white,  woman prisoner.    Within, Werper called in French and in a low whisper: \"Lady Greystoke!  It is I, M. Frecoult.  Where are you?\" But there was no response.  Hastily the man felt around the interior, groping blindly through the  darkness with outstretched hands.  There was no one within!    Werper's astonishment surpassed words.  He was on the point of stepping  without to question the sentry, when his eyes, becoming accustomed to  the dark, discovered a blotch of lesser blackness near the base of the  rear wall of the hut. Examination revealed the fact that the blotch was  an opening cut in the wall.  It was large enough to permit the passage  of his body, and assured as he was that Lady Greystoke had passed out  through the aperture in an attempt to escape the village, he lost no  time in availing himself of the same avenue; but neither did he lose  time in a fruitless search for Jane Clayton.    His own life depended upon the chance of his eluding, or outdistancing  Achmet Zek, when that worthy should have discovered that he had  escaped.  His original plan had contemplated connivance in the escape  of Lady Greystoke for two very good and sufficient reasons.  The first  was that by saving her he would win the gratitude of the English, and  thus lessen the chance of his extradition should his identity and his  crime against his superior officer be charged against him.    The second reason was based upon the fact that only one direction of  escape was safely open to him.  He could not travel to the west because  of the Belgian possessions which lay between him and the Atlantic.  The  south was closed to him by the feared presence of the savage ape-man he  had robbed.  To the north lay the friends and allies of Achmet Zek.  Only toward the east, through British East Africa, lay reasonable  assurance of freedom.    Accompanied by a titled Englishwoman whom he had rescued from a  frightful fate, and his identity vouched for by her as that of a  Frenchman by the name of Frecoult, he had looked forward, and not  without reason, to the active assistance of the British from the moment  that he came in contact with their first outpost.    But now that Lady Greystoke had disappeared, though he still looked  toward the east for hope, his chances were lessened, and another,  subsidiary design completely dashed. From the moment that he had first  laid eyes upon Jane Clayton he had nursed within his breast a secret  passion for the beautiful American wife of the English lord, and when  Achmet Zek's discovery of the jewels had necessitated flight, the  Belgian had dreamed, in his planning, of a future in which he might  convince Lady Greystoke that her husband was dead, and by playing upon  her gratitude win her for himself.    At that part of the village farthest from the gates, Werper discovered  that two or three long poles, taken from a nearby pile which had been  collected for the construction of huts, had been leaned against the top  of the palisade, forming a precarious, though not impossible avenue of  escape.    Rightly, he inferred that thus had Lady Greystoke found the means to  scale the wall, nor did he lose even a moment in following her lead.  Once in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#19)"],[1,"of the dreamer are well placed,  and a home will be bequeathed to him or her.    To dream of sweet cakes, is gain for the laboring and a favorable  opportunity for the enterprising.  Those in love will prosper.    Pound cake is significant of much pleasure either from society or business.  For a young woman to dream of her wedding cake is the only bad luck cake  in the category.  Baking them is not so good an omen as seeing them  or eating them.    _Calomel_.    To dream of calomel shows some person is seeking to deceive  and injure you through the unconscious abetting of friends.  For a young woman to dream of taking it, foretells that she will be  victimized through the artful designing of persons whom she trusts.  If it is applied externally, she will close her eyes to deceit  in order to enjoy a short season of pleasure.    _Calves_.[30]    To dream of calves peacefully grazing on a velvety lawn,  foretells to the young, happy, festive gatherings and enjoyment.  Those engaged in seeking wealth will see it rapidly increasing.      [30] See Cattle.    _Called_.    To hear your name called in a dream by strange voices,  denotes that your business will fall into a precarious state,  and that strangers may lend you assistance, or you may fail  to meet your obligations.    To hear the voice of a friend or relative, denotes the desperate  illness of some one of them, and may be death; in the latter  case you may be called upon to stand as guardian over some one,  in governing whom you should use much discretion.    Lovers hearing the voice of their affianced should heed the warning.  If they have been negligent in attention they should make amends.  Otherwise they may suffer separation from misunderstanding.    To hear the voice of the dead may be a warning of your own serious  illness or some business worry from bad judgment may ensue.  The voice is an echo thrown back from the future on the subjective mind,  taking the sound of your ancestor's voice from coming in contact  with that part of your ancestor which remains with you.  A certain portion of mind matter remains the same in lines  of family descent.    _Calendar_.    To dream of keeping a calendar, indicates that you will be very orderly  and systematic in habits throughout the year.    To see a calendar, denotes disappointment in your calculations.    _Calm_.    To see calm seas, denotes successful ending of doubtful undertaking.    To feel calm and happy, is a sign of a long and well-spent life  and a vigorous old age.    _Calumny_.    To dream that you are the subject of calumny, denotes that your  interests will suffer at the hands of evil-minded gossips.  For a young woman, it warns her to be careful of her conduct,  as her movements are being critically observed by persons  who claim to be her friends.    _Camera_.    To dream of a camera, signifies that changes will bring  undeserved environments.  For a young woman to dream that she  is taking pictures with a camera, foretells that her immediate  future will have much that is displeasing and that a friend  will subject her to acute disappointment.    _Cameo Brooch_.    To dream of a cameo brooch, denotes some sad occurrence will soon  claim your attention.    _Camels_.    To see this beast of burden, signifies that you will entertain  great patience and fortitude in time of almost unbearable  anguish and failures that will seemingly sweep every vestige  of hope from you.    To own a camel, is a sign that you will possess rich mining property.    To see a herd of camels on the desert, denotes assistance when all human  aid seems at a low ebb, and of sickness from which you will arise,  contrary to all expectations.    _Camp_.    To dream of camping in the open air, you may expect a change in your affairs,  also prepare to make a long and wearisome journey.    To see a camping settlement, many of your companions will remove  to new estates and your own prospects will appear gloomy.    For a young woman to dream that she is in a camp, denotes that  her lover will have trouble in getting her to name a day  for their wedding, and that he will prove a kind husband.  If in a military camp she will marry the first time she  has a chance.    A married woman after dreaming of being in a soldier's camp  is in danger of having her husband's name sullied, and divorce  courts may be her destination.    _Campaign_.    To dream of making a political one, signifies your opposition to  approved ways of conducting business, and you will set up original  plans for yourself regardless of enemies' working against you.  Those in power will lose.    If it is a religious people conducting a campaign against sin,  it denotes that you will be called upon to contribute from your  private means to sustain charitable institutions.    For a woman to dream that she is interested in a campaign against  fallen women, denotes that she will surmount obstacles and prove  courageous in time of need.    _Cane_.    To see cane growing in your dream, foretells favorable advancement  will be made toward fortune.  To see it cut, denotes absolute failure  in all undertakings.    _Cancer_.    To have one successfully treated in a dream, denotes a sudden  rise from obscure poverty to wealthy surroundings.    To dream of a cancer, denotes illness of some one near you,  and quarrels with those you love.  Depressions may follow  to the man of affairs after this dream.    To dream of a cancer, foretells sorrow in its ugliest phase.  Love will resolve itself into cold formality, and business  will be worrying and profitless.    _Canal_.    To see the water of a canal muddy and stagnant-looking, portends  sickness and disorders of the stomach and dark designs of enemies.  But if its waters are clear a placid life and the devotion of friends  is before you.    For a young woman to glide in a canoe across a canal, denotes a chaste life  and an adoring husband.  If she crossed the canal on a bridge over clear  water and gathers ferns and other greens on the banks, she will enjoy a life  of ceaseless rounds of pleasure and attain to high social distinction.  But if the water be turbid she will often find herself tangled in meshes  of perplexity and will be the victim of nervous troubles.    _Canary Birds_.  To dream of this sweet songster, denotes  unexpected pleasures.  For the young to dream of possessing  a beautiful canary, denotes high class honors and a successful  passage through the literary world, or a happy termination  of love's young dream.    To dream one is given you, indicates a welcome legacy.  To give away a canary, denotes that you will suffer disappointment  in your dearest wishes.    To dream that one dies, denotes the unfaithfulness of dear friends.    Advancing, fluttering, and singing canaries, in luxurious apartments,  denotes feasting and a life of exquisite refinement,  wealth, and satisfying friendships.  If the light is weird  or unnaturally bright, it augurs that you are entertaining  illusive hopes.  Your over-confidence is your worst enemy.  A young woman after this dream should beware, lest flattering  promises react upon her in disappointment.  Fairy-like scenes  in a dream are peculiarly misleading and treacherous to women.    _Candles_.    To see them burning with a clear and steady flame, denotes the constancy  of those about you and a well-grounded fortune.    For a maiden to dream that she is molding candles, denotes that she will have  an unexpected offer of marriage and a pleasant visit to distant relatives.  If she is lighting a candle, she will meet her lover clandestinely because  of parental objections.    To see a candle wasting in a draught, enemies are circulating  detrimental reports about you.    To snuff a candle, portends sorowful{sic} news.  Friends are dead  or in distressful straits.    _Candlestick_.    To see a candlestick bearing a whole candle, denotes that a bright future  lies before you filled with health, happiness and loving companions.  If empty, the reverse.    _Canker_.[31]    To dream of seeing canker on anything, is an omen of evil.  It foretells death and treacherous companions for the young.  Sorrow and loneliness to the aged.    Cankerous growths in the flesh, denote future distinctions either  as head of State or stage life.      [31] The last definition is not consistent with other parts of this book,  but I let it stand, as I find it among my automatic writings.      _Cannon_.    This dream denotes that one's home and country are in danger  of foreign intrusion, from which our youth will suffer from  the perils of war.    For a young woman to hear or see cannons, denotes she will be a soldier's wife  and will have to bid him godspeed as he marches in defense of her and honor.    The reader will have to interpret dreams of this character  by the influences surrounding him, and by the experiences stored  away in his subjective mind.  If you have thought about cannons  a great deal and you dream of them when there is no war, they are  most likely to warn you against struggle and probable defeat.  Or if business is manipulated by yourself successful engagements  after much worry and ill luck may ensue.    _Cannon-Ball_.    This means that secret enemies are uniting against you.  For a maid  to see a cannon-ball, denotes that she will have a soldier sweetheart.  For a youth to see a cannon-ball, denotes that he will be called upon  to defend his country.    _Canoe_.    To paddle a canoe on a calm stream, denotes your perfect confidence  in your own ability to conduct your business in a profitable way.    To row with a sweetheart, means an early marriage and fidelity.  To row on rough waters you will have to tame a shrew before you  attain connubial bliss.  Affairs in the business world will  prove disappointing after you dream of rowing in muddy waters.  If the waters are shallow and swift, a hasty courtship or stolen pleasures,  from which there can be no lasting good,"]]]
