Arrayed  from head to tail in a robe of richest sable hue, the bird called  rice-bird loves spots cultivated by the hand of man. The woodcutter's  house on the hills in the interior, and the planter's habitation on the  sea-coast, equally attract this songless species of the order of pie,  provided the Indian-corn be ripe there. He is nearly of the jackdaw's  size and makes his nest far away from the haunts of men. He may truly  be called a blackbird: independent of his plumage, his beak, inside and  out, his legs, his toes and claws are jet black.    Mankind, by clearing the ground and sowing a variety of seeds, induces  many kinds of birds to leave their native haunts and come and settle  near him: their little depredations on his seeds and fruits prove that  it is the property, and not the proprietor, which has the attractions.    One bird, however, in Demerara is not actuated by selfish motives: this  is the cassique. In size he is larger than the starling: he courts the  society of man, but disdains to live by his labours. When Nature calls  for support he repairs to the neighbouring forest, and there partakes  of the store of fruits and seeds which she has produced in abundance  for her aerial tribes. When his repast is over he returns to man, and  pays the little tribute which he owes him for his protection. He takes  his station on a tree close to his house, and there, for hours  together, pours forth a succession of imitative notes. His own song is  sweet, but very short. If a toucan be yelping in the neighbourhood, he  drops it, and imitates him. Then he will amuse his protector with the  cries of the different species of the woodpecker, and when the sheep  bleat he will distinctly answer them. Then comes his own song again;  and if a puppy-dog or a guinea-fowl interrupt him, he takes them off  admirably, and by his different gestures during the time you would  conclude that he enjoys the sport.    The cassique is gregarious, and imitates any sound he hears with such  exactness that he goes by no other name than that of mocking bird  amongst the colonists.    At breeding-time a number of these pretty choristers resort to a tree  near the planter's house, and from its outside branches weave their  pendulous nests. So conscious do they seem that they never give  offence, and so little suspicious are they of receiving any injury from  man, that they will choose a tree within forty yards from his house,  and occupy the branches so low down that he may peep into the nests. A  tree in Waratilla Creek affords a proof of this.    The proportions of the cassique are so fine that he may be said to be a  model of symmetry in ornithology. On each wing he has a bright yellow  spot, and his rump, belly and half the tail are of the same colour. All  the rest of the body is black. His beak is the colour of sulphur, but  it fades in death, and requires the same operation as the bill of the  toucan to make it keep its colours. Up the rivers, in the interior,  there is another cassique, nearly the same size and of the same habits,  though not gifted with its powers of imitation. Except in  breeding-time, you will see hundreds of them retiring to roost amongst  the moca-moca-trees and low shrubs on the banks of the Demerara, after  you pass the first island. They are not common on the sea-coast. The  rump of this cassique is a flaming scarlet. All the rest of the body is  a rich glossy black. His bill is sulphur-colour. You may often see  numbers of this species weaving their pendulous nests on one side of a  tree, while numbers of the other species are busy in forming theirs on  the opposite side of the same tree. Though such near neighbours, the  females are never observed to kick up a row or come to blows!    Another species of cassique, as large as a crow, is very common in the  plantations. In the morning he generally repairs to a large tree, and  there, with his tail spread over his back and shaking his lowered  wings, he produces notes which, though they cannot be said to amount to  a song, still have something very sweet and pleasing in them. He makes  his nest in the same form as the other cassiques. It is above four feet  long, and when you pass under the tree, which often contains fifty or  sixty of them, you cannot help stopping to admire them as they wave to  and fro, the sport of every storm and breeze. The rump is chestnut; ten  feathers of the tail are a fine yellow, the remaining two, which are  the middle ones, are black, and an inch shorter than the others. His  bill is sulphur-colour; all the rest of the body black, with here and  there shades of brown. He has five or six long narrow black feathers on  the back of his head, which he erects at pleasure.    There is one more species of cassique in Demerara which always prefers  the forests to the cultivated parts. His economy is the same as that of  the other cassiques. He is rather smaller than the last described bird.  His body is greenish, and his tail and rump paler than those of the  former. Half of his beak is red.    You would not be long in the forests of Demerara without noticing the  woodpeckers. You meet with them feeding at all hours of the day. Well  may they do so. Were they to follow the example of most of the other  birds, and only feed in the morning and evening, they would be often on  short allowance, for they sometimes have to labour three or four hours  at the tree before they get to their food. The sound which the largest  kind makes in hammering against the bark of the tree is so loud that  you would never suppose it to proceed from the efforts of a bird. You  would take it to be the woodman, with his axe, trying by a sturdy blow,  often repeated, whether the tree were sound or not. There are fourteen  species here: the largest the size of a magpie, the smallest no bigger  than the wren. They are all beautiful, and the greater part of them  have their heads ornamented with a fine crest, movable at pleasure.    It is said, if you once give a dog a bad name, whether innocent or  guilty, he never loses it. It sticks close to him wherever he goes. He  has many a kick and many a blow to bear on account of it; and there is  nobody to stand up for him. The woodpecker is little better off. The  proprietors of woods in Europe have long accused him of injuring their  timber by boring holes in it and letting in the water, which soon rots  it. The colonists in America have the same complaint against him. Had  he the power of speech, which Ovid's birds possessed in days of yore,  he could soon make a defence: \"Mighty lord of the woods,\" he would say  to man, \"why do you wrongfully accuse me? Why do you hunt me up and  down to death for an imaginary offence? I have never spoiled a leaf of  your property, much less your wood. Your merciless shot strikes me at  the very time I am doing you a service. But your shortsightedness will  not let you see it, or your pride is above examining closely the  actions of so insignificant a little bird as I am. If there be that  spark of feeling in your breast which they say man possesses, or ought  to possess, above all other animals, do a poor injured creature a  little kindness and watch me in your woods only for one day. I never  wound your healthy trees. I should perish for want in the attempt. The  sound bark would easily resist the force of my bill; and were I even to  pierce through it, there would be nothing inside that I could fancy or  my stomach digest. I often visit them it is true, but a knock or two  convince me that I must go elsewhere for support; and were you to  listen attentively to the sound which my bill causes, you would know  whether I am upon a healthy or an unhealthy tree. Wood and bark are not  my food. I live entirely upon the insects which have already formed a  lodgment in the distempered tree. When the sound informs me that my  prey is there, I labour for hours together till I get at it, and by  consuming it for my own support, I prevent its further depredations in  that part. Thus I discover for you your hidden and unsuspected foe,  which has been devouring your wood in such secrecy that you had not the  least suspicion it was there. The hole which I make in order to get at  the pernicious vermin will be seen by you as you pass under the tree. I  leave it as a signal to tell you that your tree has already stood too  long. It is past its prime. Millions of insects, engendered by disease,  are preying upon its vitals. Ere long it will fall a log in useless  ruins. Warned by this loss, cut down the rest in time, and spare, O  spare the unoffending woodpecker.\"    In the rivers and different creeks you number six species of the  kingfisher. They make their nest in a hole in the sand on the side of  the bank. As there is always plenty of foliage to protect them from the  heat of the sun, they feed at all hours of the day. Though their  plumage is prettily varied, still it falls far short of the brilliancy  displayed by the English kingfisher. This little native of Britain  would outweigh them altogether in the scale of beauty.    A bird called jacamar is often taken for a kingfisher, but it has no  relationship to that tribe. It frequently sits in the trees over the  water, and as its beak bears some resemblance to that of the  kingfisher, this may probably account for its being taken for one; it  feeds entirely upon insects; it sits on a branch in motionless  expectation, and as soon as a fly, butterfly, or moth pass by, it darts  at it, and returns to the branch it had just left. It seems an  indolent, sedentary bird, shunning the society of all others in the  forest. It never visits the plantations, but is found at all times of  the year in the woods. There are four species of jacamar in Demerara.  They are all beautiful: the largest, rich and superb in the extreme.  Its plumage is of so fine a changing blue and golden-green"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#19)"],[1,"minences, the spectrum of  the latter showing calcium, hydrogen, and helium; that of the former  including a number of metals.    The D line of sodium is a double line, and in the same eclipse (1868)  an orange line was noticed which was afterwards found to lie close to  the two components of the D line. It did not correspond with any known  terrestrial element, and the unknown element was called \"helium.\" It  was not until 1895 that Sir William Ramsay found this element as a gas  in the mineral cleavite.    The spectrum of the corona is partly continuous, indicating light  reflected from the sun's body. But it also shows a green line  corresponding with no known terrestrial element, and the name  \"coronium\" has been given to the substance causing it.    A vast number of facts have been added to our knowledge about the sun  by photography and the spectroscope. Speculations and hypotheses in  plenty have been offered, but it may be long before we have a complete  theory evolved to explain all the phenomena of the storm-swept  metallic atmosphere of the sun.    The proceedings of scientific societies teem with such facts and  \"working hypotheses,\" and the best of them have been collected by Miss  Clerke in her _History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century_. As  to established facts, we learn from the spectroscopic researches (1)  that the continuous spectrum is derived from the _photosphere_ or  solar gaseous material compressed almost to liquid consistency; (2)  that the _reversing layer_ surrounds it and gives rise to black  lines in the spectrum; that the _chromosphere_ surrounds this, is  composed mainly of hydrogen, and is the cause of the red prominences  in eclipses; and that the gaseous _corona_ surrounds all of  these, and extends to vast distances outside the sun's visible  surface.

THE MOON AND PLANETS.      _The Moon_.--Telescopic discoveries about the moon commence with  Galileo's discovery that her surface has mountains and valleys, like  the earth. He also found that, while she always turns the same face to  us, there is periodically a slight twist to let us see a little round  the eastern or western edge. This was called _libration_, and the  explanation was clear when it was understood that in showing always  the same face to us she makes one revolution a month on her axis  _uniformly_, and that her revolution round the earth is not  uniform.    Galileo said that the mountains on the moon showed greater differences  of level than those on the earth.  Shroeter supported this  opinion. W. Herschel opposed it. But Beer and Maedler measured the  heights of lunar mountains by their shadows, and found four of them  over 20,000 feet above the surrounding plains.    Langrenus [1] was the first to do serious work on selenography, and  named the lunar features after eminent men. Riccioli also made lunar  charts. In 1692 Cassini made a chart of the full moon. Since then we  have the charts of Schroeter, Beer and Maedler (1837), and of Schmidt,  of Athens (1878); and, above all, the photographic atlas by Loewy and  Puiseux.    The details of the moon's surface require for their discussion a whole  book, like that of Neison or the one by Nasmyth and Carpenter. Here a  few words must suffice. Mountain ranges like our Andes or Himalayas  are rare. Instead of that, we see an immense number of circular  cavities, with rugged edges and flat interior, often with a cone in  the centre, reminding one of instantaneous photographs of the splash  of a drop of water falling into a pool. Many of these are fifty or  sixty miles across, some more. They are generally spoken of as  resembling craters of volcanoes, active or extinct, on the earth. But  some of those who have most fully studied the shapes of craters deny  altogether their resemblance to the circular objects on the moon.  These so-called craters, in many parts, are seen to be closely  grouped, especially in the snow-white parts of the moon. But there are  great smooth dark spaces, like the clear black ice on a pond, more  free from craters, to which the equally inappropriate name of seas has  been given. The most conspicuous crater, _Tycho_, is near the south  pole. At full moon there are seen to radiate from Tycho numerous  streaks of light, or \"rays,\" cutting through all the mountain  formations, and extending over fully half the lunar disc, like the  star-shaped cracks made on a sheet of ice by a blow.  Similar cracks  radiate from other large craters. It must be mentioned that these  white rays are well seen only in full light of the sun at full moon,  just as the white snow in the crevasses of a glacier is seen bright  from a distance only when the sun is high, and disappears at  sunset. Then there are deep, narrow, crooked \"rills\" which may have  been water-courses; also \"clefts\" about half a mile wide, and often  hundreds of miles long, like deep cracks in the surface going straight  through mountain and valley.    The moon shares with the sun the advantage of being a good subject for  photography, though the planets are not. This is owing to her larger  apparent size, and the abundance of illumination. The consequence is  that the finest details of the moon, as seen in the largest telescope  in the world, may be reproduced at a cost within the reach of all.    No certain changes have ever been observed; but several suspicions  have been expressed, especially as to the small crater _Linne_, in the  _Mare Serenitatis_. It is now generally agreed that no certainty can  be expected from drawings, and that for real evidence we must await  the verdict of photography.    No trace of water or of an atmosphere has been found on the moon. It  is possible that the temperature is too low. In any case, no  displacement of a star by atmospheric refraction at occultation has  been surely recorded. The moon seems to be dead.    The distance of the moon from the earth is just now the subject of  re-measurement. The base line is from Greenwich to Cape of Good Hope,  and the new feature introduced is the selection of a definite point on  a crater (Moesting A), instead of the moon's edge, as the point whose  distance is to be measured.    _The Inferior Planets_.--When the telescope was invented, the phases  of Venus attracted much attention; but the brightness of this planet,  and her proximity to the sun, as with Mercury also, seemed to be a bar  to the discovery of markings by which the axis and period of rotation  could be fixed. Cassini gave the rotation as twenty-three hours, by  observing a bright spot on her surface. Shroeter made it 23h. 21m. 19s.  This value was supported by others. In 1890 Schiaparelli[2] announced  that Venus rotates, like our moon, once in one of her revolutions, and  always directs the same face to the sun. This property has also been  ascribed to Mercury; but in neither case has the evidence been  generally accepted. Twenty-four hours is probably about the period of  rotation for each of these planets.    Several observers have claimed to have seen a planet within the orbit  of Mercury, either in transit over the sun's surface or during an  eclipse. It has even been named _Vulcan_. These announcements would  have received little attention but for the fact that the motion of  Mercury has irregularities which have not been accounted for by known  planets; and Le Verrier[3] has stated that an intra-Mercurial planet  or ring of asteroids would account for the unexplained part of the  motion of the line of apses of Mercury's orbit amounting to 38\" per  century.    _Mars_.--The first study of the appearance of Mars by Miraldi led him  to believe that there were changes proceeding in the two white caps  which are seen at the planet's poles. W. Herschel attributed these  caps to ice and snow, and the dates of his observations indicated a  melting of these ice-caps in the Martian summer.    Schroter attributed the other markings on Mars to drifting clouds. But  Beer and Maedler, in 1830-39, identified the same dark spots as being  always in the same place, though sometimes blurred by mist in the  local winter. A spot sketched by Huyghens in 1672, one frequently seen  by W. Herschel in 1783, another by Arago in 1813, and nearly all the  markings recorded by Beer and Maedler in 1830, were seen and drawn by  F. Kaiser in Leyden during seventeen nights of the opposition of 1862  (_Ast. Nacht._, No. 1,468), whence he deduced the period of rotation  to be 24h. 37m. 22s.,62--or one-tenth of a second less than the period  deduced by R. A. Proctor from a drawing by Hooke in 1666.    It must be noted that, if the periods of rotation both of Mercury and  Venus be about twenty-four hours, as seems probable, all the four  planets nearest to the sun rotate in the same period, while the great  planets rotate in about ten hours (Uranus and Neptune being still  indeterminate).    The general surface of Mars is a deep yellow; but there are dark grey  or greenish patches. Sir John Herschel was the first to attribute the  ruddy colour of Mars to its soil rather than to its atmosphere.    The observations of that keen-sighted observer Dawes led to the first  good map of Mars, in 1869. In the 1877 opposition Schiaparelli revived  interest in the planet by the discovery of canals, uniformly about  sixty miles wide,"]]]
