Instead, he asked how much the mass before him amounted to, and  when he was informed he doubled it, saying: \"I was not aware that I had  allowed him so little.\" It can clearly be seen, then, that as a result of  the magnitude of his expenditures he would quickly exhaust the treasures  in the royal vaults and quickly need new revenues. Hence unusual taxes  were imposed and the property of the well-to-do was not left intact. Some  lost their possessions to spite him and others destroyed themselves with  their livelihoods. Similarly he hated and made away with some others who  had no considerable wealth; for, if they possessed any excellent trait or  were of a good family, he became suspicious that they disliked him.    [Sidenote:--6--] Such were the general characteristics of Nero. I shall  now proceed to details.    In the matter of horse-races Nero grew so enthusiastic that he adorned  famous race-horses that had passed their prime with the regular street  costume for men and honored them with money for their fodder. The  horsebreeders and charioteers, elated at this enthusiasm of his, proceeded  to abuse unjustifiably even the praetors and consuls. But Aulus Fabricius,  when praetor, finding that they refused to hold contests on fair terms,  dispensed with them entirely. He trained dogs to draw chariots and  introduced them in place of horses. When this was done, the wearers of the  white and of the red immediately entered their chariots: but, as the  Greens and the Blues would not even then participate, Nero at his own cost  gave the prizes to the horses, and the regular program of the circus was  carried out.    Agrippina showed readiness to attack the greatest undertakings, as is  evidenced by her causing the death of Marcus Julius Silanus, to whom she  sent some of the poison with which she had treacherously murdered her  husband.    Silanus was governor of Asia, and was in no respect inferior to the  general character of his family. It was for this, more than for anything  else, she said, that she killed him, not wishing to have him preferred  before Nero, by reason of the latter's manner of life. Moreover, she  turned everything into trade and gathered money from the most  insignificant and basest sources.    Laelianus, who was despatched to Armenia in place of Pollio, had been  assigned to the command of the night watch. And he was no better than  Pollio, for, while surpassing him in reputation, he was all the more  insatiable in respect to gain.    [Sidenote: A.D. 55 (a.u. 808)] [Sidenote:--7--] Agrippina found a  grievance in the fact that she was no longer supreme in affairs of the  palace. It was chiefly because of Acte. Acte had been brought as a slave  from Asia. She caught the fancy of Nero, was adopted into the family of  Attalus, and was cherished much more carefully than was Nero's wife  Octavia. Agrippina, indignant at this and at other matters, first  attempted to rebuke him, and set herself to humiliating his associates,  some by beatings and by getting rid of others. But when she accomplished  nothing, she took it greatly to heart and remarked to him: \"It was I who  made you emperor,\" just as if she had the power to take away the authority  from him again. She did not comprehend that every form of independent  power given to any one by a private citizen immediately ceases to be the  property of the giver and belongs to the one who receives it to use  against his benefactor.    Britannicus Nero murdered treacherously by poison, and then, as the skin  was turned livid by the action of the drug, he smeared the body with  gypsum. But as it was being carried through the Forum a heavy rain falling  while the gypsum was still damp washed it all away, so that the horror was  exposed not only to comment but to view. [After Britannicus was dead  Seneca and Burrus ceased to give careful attention to public interests and  were satisfied if they might manage them conservatively and still preserve  their lives. Consequently Nero now made himself conspicuous by giving free  rein to all his desires without fear of retribution. His behavior began to  be absolutely insensate, as is shown, for instance, by his punishing a  certain knight, Antonius, as a seller of poisons and by further burning  the poisons publicly. He took great credit for this action as well as for  prosecuting some persons who had tampered with wills; but other people  only laughed to see him punishing his own acts in the persons of others.]    [Sidenote:--8--] His secret acts of licentiousness were many, both at home  and throughout the City, by night and by day. He used to frequent the  taverns and wandered about everywhere like a private person. Any number of  beatings and insults took place in this connection and the evil spread to  the theatres, so that those who worked as dancers and who had charge of  the horses paid no attention either to praetors or to consuls. They were  disorderly themselves and led others to be the same, while Nero not only  did not restrain them even by words, but stirred them up all the more. He  delighted in their actions and used to be secretly conveyed in a litter  into the theatres, where unseen by the rest he watched the proceedings.  Indeed, he forbade the soldiers who had usually been in attendance at all  public gatherings to appear there any longer. The reason he assigned was  that they ought not to superintend anything but strictly military affairs,  but his true purpose was to afford those who wished to raise a disturbance  the amplest scope. He made use of the same excuse in reference to his not  allowing any soldier to attend his mother, saying that no one except the  emperor ought to be guarded by them. In this way he displayed his enmity  toward the masses, and as for his mother he was already openly at variance  with her. Everything that they said to each other, or that the imperial  pair did each day, was reported outside the palace, yet it did not all  reach the public and hence conjectures were made to supply missing details  and different versions arose. What was conceivable as happening, in view  of the baseness and lewdness of the pair, was noised abroad as having  already taken place, and reports possessing some credibility were believed  as true. The populace, seeing Agrippina now for the first time without  Pretorians, took care not to fall in with her even by accident; and if any  one did chance to meet her he would hastily get out of the way without  saying a word.    [Sidenote:--9--] At one spectacle men on horseback overcame bulls while  riding along beside them, and the knights who served as Nero's personal  guard brought down with their javelins four hundred bears and three  hundred lions. On the same occasion thirty knights belonging to the  military fought in the arena. The emperor sanctioned such proceedings  openly. Secretly, however, he carried on nocturnal revels throughout the  length and breadth of the city, insulting the women, practicing lewdness  on boys, stripping those whom he encountered, striking, wounding,  murdering. He had an idea that his incognito was impenetrable, for he used  all sorts of different costumes and false hair at different times: but he  would be recognized by his retinue and by his deeds. No one else would  have dared to commit so many and such gross outrages so recklessly.  [Sidenote: A.D. 56 (a.u. 809)] It was becoming unsafe even for a person to  stay at home, since he would break into shops and houses. It came about  that a certain Julius Montanus, [Footnote: _C. Iulius Montanus C.F._  (Cp. Suetonius, Life of Nero, chapter 60).] a senator, enraged on his  wife's account, fell upon this reveler and inflicted many blows upon him,  so that he had to remain several days in concealment by reason of the  black eyes he had received. Montanus did not suffer for it, since Nero  thought the violence had been all an accident and was for showing no anger  at the occurrence, had not the other sent him a letter begging his pardon.  Nero on reading the epistle remarked: \"So he knew that he was striking  Nero.\" The suicide of Montanus followed hard after.    [Sidenote: A.D. 57 (a.u. 810)] In the course of producing a spectacle at  one of the theatres, he suddenly filled the place with sea-water so that  the fishes and sea-monsters [Footnote: [Greek: ktaenae] of the MSS. was  changed to [Greek: kaetae] on the conjecture of Sylburgius, who was  followed by Bekker, Dindorf, and Boissevain. (Compare also Suetonius, Life  of Nero, chapter 12).] swam in it, and had a naval battle between  \"Persians\" and \"Athenians.\" At the close of it he suddenly withdrew the  water, dried the subsoil, and continued land contests, not only between  two men at a time but with crowds pitted against other crowds.    [Sidenote: A.D. 58 (a.u. 811)] [Sidenote:--10--] Subsequent to this,  oratorical contests took place, and as a result even of these numbers were  exiled and put to death.--Seneca also was held to account, one of the  charges against him being that he was intimate with Agrippina. [It had not  been enough for him to debauch Julia, nor had he become better as a result  of exile, but he went on to make advances to such a woman as Agrippina,  with such a son.] Not only in this instance but in others he was convicted  of doing precisely the opposite of what he taught in his philosophical  doctrines. He brought accusations against tyranny, yet he made himself a  teacher of tyrants: he denounced such of his associates as were powerful,  yet he did not hold aloof from the palace himself: he had nothing good to  say of flatterers, yet he had so fawned upon Messalina and Claudius's  freedmen [that he had sent them from the island a book containing eulogies  upon them; this latter caused him such mortification that he erased the  passage.] While finding fault with the rich, he himself possessed a  property of seven thousand five hundred myriads; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#2)"],[1,"cine--How the Chipmunk Carried the  Good News.

Without even knocking at the door there noiselessly entered our northern  home two large, unhandsome Indians. They paid not the slightest attention  to the grown-up palefaces present, but in their ghostly way marched across  the room to the corner where the two little children were playing on the  floor. Quickly but gently picking them up they swung them to their  shoulders, and then, without a word of salutation or even a glance at the  parents, they noiselessly passed out of that narrow door and disappeared in  the virgin forest. They were pagan Saulteaux, by name Souwanas and Jakoos.    The Indian names by which these two children were called by the natives  were \"Sagastaookemou,\" which means the \"Sunrise Gentleman,\" and  \"Minnehaha,\" \"Laughing Waters.\"    To the wigwam of Souwanas, \"South Wind,\" these children were being carried.  They had no fear of these big Indians, though the boy was only six years  old, and his little sister but four. They had learned to look with laughing  eyes even into the fiercest and ugliest of these red faces and had made  them their friends.    So even now, while being carried away among the dense trees, they merrily  laughed and shouted to each other. The bright patches of sunshine on the  ground, the singing birds, and the few brilliant-hued summer flowers,  brought forth their exclamations of delight, while all the time the grave,  silent Indians hurried them on deeper and deeper into the forest. Yet  carefully they guarded their precious loads, and as the antlered deer in  passing through the thick woods and under the low branches never strike  trunk or bough, so these sons of the forest glided swiftly on without  allowing any hurt to come to the children of the paleface, even if at times  the faint trail led them over slippery rocks and under low intertwining  branches.    The wigwam of Souwanas was pitched in a beautiful spot at the edge of the  great forest near the sandy, rocky eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg. This  great lake is well called The Sea, which is the meaning of its Indian name.  It is about as long as Lakes Ontario and Erie combined and in some places  is eighty miles wide.    At the entrance of the wigwam, which was made of a couple of tanned  reindeerskins, the children were carefully lifted down from the men's  shoulders and then taken into this Indian abode. Coming in suddenly from  the bright sunshine it was some time before they could see distinctly. The  door flap of deerskin had dropped like a curtain behind them. All the light  there was came in through the hole in the top, where the poles of the  wigwam crossed each other. Presently, however, they were able to see a  circle of Indian children gathered around a small fire that smoldered on  the ground in the center of the tent. It was now in the pleasant summer  time, but the fire was needed for something else than warmth, as the little  Sagastao and Minnehaha discovered before long. They were soon seated in the  circle with the red children, who, young though they were, were a wee bit  startled at seeing these little palefaces. The white children, however,  simply laughed with glee. This outward demonstration seemed very improper  to the silent red children, who were taught to refrain from expressions of  their gladness or sorrow.    The Indians had brought the white children for a characteristic reason.  They had said among themselves, \"If the white father and mother love us as  they say they do we will test them by taking away their children without  asking permission.\" They also wished to show their own love for the  children, and so had really brought them to a children's feast.    It was perhaps as queer a tea party as you ever heard of. There was no  table on which to put the good things prepared for the feast. No plates, no  cups and saucers, no knives, no spoons, not even a chair! There were no  cakes, no tarts, no jam, no pies, not even any bread and butter!    \"Well, what a feast!\" you say. \"Without any place to sit, or good things to  eat!\" Not too fast! There were both of these. There was the lap of mother  earth, and so down on the ground, with bearskins and deerskins on it for  rugs, the children sat. Then the deerskin door was again opened and in came  Indians with birch-bark dishes, called _rogans_, in which were nicely  prepared wild ducks, rabbits, and partridges. But as they were uncooked  they could not yet be eaten by the now expectant, hungry children.    Then began the preparation of the feast. Some of the Indians added dry wood  to the fire until there was a hot, smokeless blaze. Others took out their  sharp hunting knives and cleverly cut up the ducks, rabbits, and  partridges. Then these pieces were spitted on the ends of sharp points of  hard wood and skillfully broiled or toasted in the hot flames. As fast as  the dainty bits of meat were cooked and a little cooled they were given to  the children in their fingers, and in that way the little ones had their  feast.    Now, please don't turn up your noses at such a feast. Think of it: out in a  wigwam in the lovely forest, where the wild birds sing and the squirrels  chatter, where is heard the music of the waves playing on the shore but a  few yards away, with great friendly Indians as your waiters! The very air  of that northern summer gives you an appetite ready for anything.    Those little people, red and white, soon became the jolliest of friends,  and as the white children could speak the Indian language as well as their  own they were soon all chattering away most merrily while they daintily  picked the bones. Of course this way of eating was hard upon their hands,  faces, and clothing, but what healthy child ever gave a second thought--if  a first--to any of these things?    After a time this feast, as all feasts must, came to an end. Then the  question was, \"What shall we do next for the children?\" for the whole day  had been planned by the grown-up Indians for the entertainment of the  little people. Canoes had been collected on the shore of Winnipeg, handy if  it should be decided that they all should go for an afternoon outing on the  water. However, Souwanas, who had gone out to look at the sky and observe  the winds and waves, now came in and reported that he thought they would  better put off the canoe trip to some time when the lake was more calm. It  was then suggested that the children be asked what would please them most.  The little folks, white and red, were not"]]]
