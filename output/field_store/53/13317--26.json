He is very eccentric; ain't he?\"    \"I don't know who he is,\" she replied. \"Father agrees with you. He  says he talks sometimes as if he was daft, but that, I believe, is  only because he is so learned. He has a house a way back in the  forest, where he lives occasionally; but the greater part of the year  he wanders about the woods, and camps out like--\"    She hesitated a moment, and then brought out the reluctant word: \"an  Indian. He knows the name of every plant and flower in the country,  and their uses; and the nature of every root, or bark, or leaf that  ever was; and then he knows all the ores, and coal mines, and  everything of that kind. He is a great hand for stuffing birds and  animals, and has some of every kind there is in the province. As for  butterflies, beetles, and those sort of things, he will chase them  like a child all day. His house is a regular--. I don't recollect the  word in English; in Gaelic it is 'tigh neonachais.'\"    \"Museum?\" said I.    \"Ah, that's it,\" said she.    \"He can't have much practice,\" I said, \"if he goes racing and chasing  over the country that way, like a run-away engine.\"    \"He don't want it, Sir,\" she replied, \"he is very well off. He says he  is one of the richest men in the country, for he don't spend half his  income, and that any man who does that is wealthy. He says he ain't a  doctor. Whether he is or not, I don't know; but he makes wonderful  cures. Nothing in the world makes him so angry as when anybody sends  for him that can afford a doctor, for he don't take pay. Now, this  morning he stormed, and raved, and stamped, and foamed at the mouth,  as if he was mad; he fairly swore, a thing I never heard him do  before; and he seized the hammer that he chips off stones with, and  threatened the man so who come for him, that he stood with the door in  his hand, while he begged him to go.    \"'Oh, Sir,' said he, 'the Squire will die if you don't go.'    \"'Let him die, then,' he replied, 'and be hanged. What is it to me? It  serves him right. Why didn't he send for Doctor Smith, and pay him?  Does he think I am a going to rob that man of his living? Be off, Sir,  off with you. Tell him I can't come, and won't come, and do you go for  a magistrate to make his will.'    \"As soon as the man quitted the house, his fit left him.    \"'Well,\" said he, 'Peter, I suppose we musn't let the man perish after  all; but I wish he hadn't sent for me, especially just now, for I want  to have a long talk with Mr Slick.'    \"And he and father set off immediately through the woods.\"    \"Suppose we beat up his quarters,\" said I, \"Jessie. I should like to  see his house and collection, amazingly.\"    \"Oh,\" said she, \"so should I, above all things; but I wouldn't ask him  for the world. He'll do it for you, I know he will; for he says you  are a man after his own heart. You study nature so; and I don't know  what all, he said of you.\"    \"Well, well,\" sais I, \"old trapper as he is, see if I don't catch him.  I know how to bait the trap; so he will walk right into it. And then,  if he has anything to eat there, I'll show him how to cook it woodsman  fashion. I'll teach him how to dress a salmon; roast, boil, or bake.  How to make a bee-hunter's mess; a new way to do his potatoes camp  fashion; and how to dispense with kitchen-ranges, cabouses, or  cooking-stoves. If I could only knock over some wild-ducks at the lake  here, I'd show him a simple way of preparing them, that would make his  mouth water, I know. Truth is, a man that lives in the country ought  to know a little of everything a'most, and he can't be comfortable if  he don't. But dear me, I must be a movin.\"    So I made her a bow, and she made me one of her best courtseys. And I  held out my hand to her, but she didn't take it, though I see a smile  playin' over her face. The fact is, it is just as well she didn't, for  I intended to draw her--. Well, it ain't no matter what I intended to  do; and therefore it ain't no use to confess what I didn't realise.    \"Truth is,\" said I, lingering a bit, not to look disappointed, \"a  farmer ought to know what to raise, how to live, and where to save. If  two things are equally good, and one costs money, and the other only a  little trouble, the choice ain't difficult, is it?\"    \"Mr Slick,\" sais she, \"are you a farmer?\"    \"I was bred and born on a farm, dear,\" sais I, \"and on one, too, where  nothin' was ever wasted, and no time ever lost; where there was a  place for everything, and everything was in its place. Where peace and  plenty reigned; and where there was a shot in the locker for the  minister, and another for the poor, and--\"    \"You don't mean to say that you considered them game, did you?\" said  she, looking archly.    \"Thank you,\" sais I. \"But now you are making game of me, Miss; that's  not a bad hit of yours though; and a shot for the bank, at the eend of  the year. I know all about farm things, from raisin' Indian corn down  to managing a pea-hen; the most difficult thing to regulate next to a  wife, I ever see.\"    \"Do you live on a farm now?\"    \"Yes, when I am to home,\" sais I, \"I have returned again to the old  occupation and the old place; for, after all, what's bred in the bone,  you know, is hard to get out of the flesh, and home is home, however  homely. The stones, and the trees, and the brooks, and the hills look  like old friends--don't you think so?\"    \"I should think so,\" she said; \"but I have never returned to my home  or my people, and never shall.\" And the tears rose in her eyes, and  she got up and walked to the window, and said, with her back towards  me, as if she was looking at the weather: \"The doctor has a fine day  for his journey; I hope he will return soon. I think you will like  him.\"    And then she came back and took her seat, as composed as if I had  never awakened those sad thoughts. Poor thing! I knew what was passing  in her mind, as well as if those eloquent tears had not touched my  heart. Somehow or another, it appears to me, like a stumblin' horse, I  am always a-striking my foot agin some stone, or stump, or root, that  any fellow might see with half an eye. She forced a smile, and said:    \"Are you married, Sir?\"    \"Married,\" sais I, \"to be sure I am; I married Flora.\"    \"You must think me as innocent as she was, to believe that,\" she said,  and laughed at the idea. \"How many children have you?\"    \"Seven,\" sais I:      \"Richard R., and Ira C.,    Betsey Anne, and Jessie B.,    Sary D., Eugeen--E,    And Iren--ee.\"    \"I have heard a great deal of you, Mr Slick,\" she said, \"but you are  the queerest man I ever see. You talk so serious, and yet you are so  full of fun.\"    \"That's because I don't pretend to nothin', dear;\" sais I, \"I am just  a nateral man. There is a time for all things, and a way to do 'em  too. If I have to freeze down solid to a thing, why then, ice is the  word. If there is a thaw, then fun and snow-ballin' is the ticket. I  listen to a preacher, and try to be the better for his argufying, if  he has any sense, and will let me; and I listen to the violin, and  dance to it, if it's in tune, and played right. I like my pastime, and  one day in seven is all the Lord asks. Evangelical people say he wants  the other six. Let them state day and date and book and page for that,  for I won't take their word for it. So I won't dance of a Sunday; but  show me a pretty gall, and give me good music, and see if I don't  dance any other day. I am not a droll man, dear, but I say what I  think, and do what I please, as long as I know I ain't saying or doing  wrong. And if that ain't poetry, it's truth, that's all.\"    \"I wish you knew the doctor,\" said she; \"I don't understand these  things, but you are the only man I ever met that talked like him, only  he hante the fun you have; but he enjoys fun beyond everything. I must  say I rather like him, though he is odd, and I am sure you would, for  you could comprehend many things he sais that I don't.\"    \"It strikes me,\" sais I to myself, for I thought, puttin' this and  that together; \"her rather likin' him, and her desire to see his  house, and her tryin' to flatter me that I talked like him; that  perhaps, like her young Gaelic friend's brother who dreamed of the  silver dollars, she might have had a dream of him.\"    So, sais I, \"I have an idea, Jessie, that there is a subject, if he  talked to you upon, you could understand.\"    \"Oh, nonsense,\" said she, rising and laughing, \"now do you go on board  and get me your book; and I will go and see about dinner for the  Doc--for my father and you.\"    Well, I held out my hand, and said,    \"Good-morning, Miss Jessie. Recollect, when I bring you the book that  you must pay the forfeit.\"    She dropt my hand in a minute, stood up as straight as a tragedy  actress, and held her head as high as the Queen of Sheby. She gave me  a look I shan't very easily forget, it was so full of scorn and pride.    \"And you too, Sir,\" said she, \"I didn't expect this of you,\" and then  left the room.    \"Hullo!\" sais I, \"who's half-cracked now; you or the doctor? it  appears to me it's six of one and half-a-dozen of the other;\" and I  took my hat, and walked down to the beach and hailed a boat.    About four I returned to the house, and brought with me, as I  promised, the \"Clockmaker.\" When I entered the room, I found Jessie  there, who received me with her usual ease and composure. She was  trimming a work-bag, the sides of which were made of the inner bark of  the birch-tree, and beautifully worked with porcupine quills and moose  hair.    \"Well,\" sais I, \"that is the most delicate thing I ever saw in all my  born days. Creation, how that would be prized in Boston! How on earth  did you learn to do that?\" sais I.    \"Why,\" said she, with an effort that evidently cost her a struggle,  \"my people make and barter them at the Fort at the north-west for  things of more use. Indians have no money.\"    It "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#19)"],[1,"never want, depend upon it.  I would have given you still more for him, but that, perhaps, you'd  suspect I intended it as a design upon you.--O sir, said I, take back  your guineas! I will not touch one, nor will my father, I am sure, till  he knows what is to be done for them; and particularly what is to become  of me. Why then, Pamela, said he, suppose I find a man of probity,  and genteel calling, for a husband for you, that shall make you a  gentlewoman as long as you live?--I want no husband, sir, said I: for  now I began to see him in all his black colours!--Yet being so much in  his power, I thought I would a little dissemble. But, said he, you  are so pretty, that go where you will, you can never be free from the  designs of some or other of our sex; and I shall think I don't answer  the care of my dying mother for you, who committed you to me, if I don't  provide you a husband to protect your virtue, and your innocence; and a  worthy one I have thought of for you.    O black, perfidious creature! thought I, what an implement art thou  in the hands of Lucifer, to ruin the innocent heart!--Yet still I  dissembled: for I feared much both him and the place I was in. But,  whom, pray sir, have you thought of?--Why, said he, young Mr. Williams,  my chaplain, in Lincolnshire, who will make you happy. Does he know,  sir, said I, any thing of your honour's intentions?--No, my girl, said  he, and kissed me, (much against my will; for his very breath was now  poison to me,) but his dependance upon my favour, and your beauty and  merit, will make him rejoice at my kindness to him. Well, sir, said I,  then it is time enough to consider of this matter; and it cannot hinder  me from going to my father's: for what will staying a fortnight longer  signify to this? Your honour's care and goodness may extend to me there,  as well as here; and Mr. Williams, and all the world, shall know that I  am not ashamed of my father's poverty.    He would kiss me again, and I said, If I am to think of Mr. Williams, or  any body, I beg you'll not be so free with me: that is not pretty, I'm  sure. Well, said he, but you stay this next fortnight, and in that time  I'll have both Williams and your father here; for I will have the match  concluded in my house; and when I have brought it on, you shall settle  it as you please together. Meantime take and send only these fifty  pieces to your father, as an earnest of my favour, and I'll make you  all happy.--Sir, said I, I beg at least two hours to consider of this.  I shall, said he, be gone out in one hour; and I would have you write to  your father what I propose; and John shall carry it on purpose: and he  shall take the purse with him for the good old man, if you approve it.  Sir, said I, I will then let you know in one hour my resolution. Do so,  said he; and gave me another kiss, and let me go.    O how I rejoiced I had got out of his clutches!--So I write you this,  that you may see how matters stand; for I am resolved to come away, if  possible. Base, wicked, treacherous gentleman as he is!    So here was a trap laid for your poor Pamela! I tremble to think of  it! O what a scene of wickedness was here laid down for all my wretched  life! Black-hearted wretch! how I hate him!--For, at first, as you'll  see by what I have written, he would have made me believe other things;  and this of Mr. Williams, I suppose, came into his head after he walked  out from his closet, to give himself time to think how to delude me  better: but the covering was now too thin, and easy to be seen through.    I went to my chamber, and the first thing I did was to write to him; for  I thought it was best not to see him again, if I could help it; and I  put it under his parlour door, after I had copied it, as follows:    'HONOURED SIR,    'Your last proposal to me convinces me, that I ought not to stay, but  to go to my father, if it were but to ask his advice about Mr. Williams.  And I am so set upon it, that I am not to be persuaded. So, honoured  sir, with a thousand thanks for all favours, I will set out to-morrow  early; and the honour you designed me, as Mrs. Jervis tells me, of your  chariot, there will be no occasion for: because I can hire, I believe,  farmer Brady's chaise. So, begging you will not take it amiss, I shall  ever be 'Your dutiful Servant.'    'As to the purse, sir, my poor father, to be sure, won't forgive me, if  I take it, till he can know how to deserve it which is impossible.'    So he has just now sent Mrs. Jervis to tell me, that since I am resolved  to go, go I may, and the travelling chariot shall be ready; but it shall  be worse for me; for that he will never trouble himself about me as long  as he lives. Well, so I get out of the house, I care not; only I should  have been glad I could, with innocence, have made you, my dear parents,  happy.    I cannot imagine the reason of it, but John, who I thought was gone with  my last, is but now going; and he sends to know if I have any thing else  to carry. So I break off to send you this with the former.    I am now preparing for my journey, and about taking leave of my good  fellow-servants: and if I have not time to write, I must tell you the  rest, when I am so happy as to be with you.    One word more: I slip in a paper of verses, on my going: sad poor stuff!  but as they come from me, you'll not dislike them, may be. I shewed them  to Mrs. Jervis, and she liked them, and took a copy; and made one sing  them to her, and in the green-room too; but I looked into the closet  first. I will only add, that I am Your dutiful DAUGHTER.    Let me just say, That he has this moment sent me five guineas by Mrs.  Jervis, as a present for my pocket: So I shall be very rich; for as she  brought them, I thought I might take them. He says he won't see me: and  I may go when I will in the morning; and Lincolnshire Robin shall drive  me: but he is so angry, he orders that nobody shall go out at the door  with me, not so much as into the coach-yard. Well! I can't help it, not  I! But does not this expose himself more than me?    But John waits, and I would have brought this and the other myself; but  he says, he has put it up among other things, and so can take both as  well as one.    John is very good, and very honest; I am under great obligations to him.  I'd give him a guinea, now I'm so rich, if I thought he'd take it. I  hear nothing of my lady's clothes, and those my master gave me: for I  told Mrs. Jervis, I would not take them; but I fancy, by a word or two  that was dropped, they will be sent after me. Dear sirs! what a rich  Pamela you'll have if they should! But as I can't wear them if they do,  I don't desire them; and if I have them, will turn them into money, as I  can have opportunity. Well, no more--I'm in a fearful hurry!      VERSES ON MY GOING AWAY.                 I.      My fellow-servants dear, attend    To these few lines, which I have penn'd:    I'm sure they're from your honest friend,    And wisher-well, poor PAMELA.                II.      I, from a state of low degree,    Was plac'd in this good family:    Too high a fate for humble me,    The helpless, hopeless PAMELA.               III.      Yet though my happy lot was so,    Joyful, I homeward from it go,    No less content, when poor and low,    Than here you find your PAMELA.                IV.      For what indeed is happiness,    But conscience innocence and peace?    And that's a treasure I possess;    Thank Heaven that gave it PAMELA.                 V.      My future lot I cannot know    But this I'm sure, where'er I go,    Whate'er I am, whate'er I do,    I'll be the grateful PAMELA.                VI.      No sad regrets my heart annoy,    I'll pray for all your peace and joy,    From master high, to scullion boy,    For all your loves to PAMELA.               VII.      One thing or two I've more to say;    God's holy will, be sure, obey;    And for our master always pray,    As ever shall poor PAMELA.              VIII.      For, oh! we pity should the great,    Instead of envying their estate;    Temptations always on 'em wait,    Exempt from which are such as we.               IX.      Their riches, gay deceitful snares,    Enlarge their fears, increase their cares    Their servants' joy surpasses theirs;    At least so judges PAMELA.                 X.      Your parents and relations love    Let them your duty ever prove;    And you'll be bless'd by Heav'n above,    As will, I hope, poor PAMELA.                XI.      For if asham'd I e'er could be    Of my dear parents' low degree,    What lot had been too mean for me,    Unbless'd, unvirtuous PAMELA.               XII.      Thrice happy may you ever be,    Each one in his and her degree;    And, sirs, whene'er you think of me,    Pray for content to PAMELA.              XIII.      Pray for her wish'd content and peace;    And rest assur'd she'll never cease,    To pray for all your joys increase,    While life is lent to PAMELA.               XIV.      On God all future good depends:    Serve him.  And so my sonnet ends,    With, thank ye, thank ye, honest friends,    For all your loves to PAMELA,    Here it is necessary the reader should know, that the fair Pamela's  trials were not yet over; but the worst were to come, at a time when she  thought them at an end, and that she was returning to her father: for  when her master found her virtue was not to be subdued, and he had in  vain tried to conquer his passion for her, being a gentleman of pleasure  and intrigue, he had ordered his Lincolnshire coachman to bring his  travelling chariot from thence, not caring to trust his Bedfordshire  coachman, who, with the rest of the servants, so greatly loved and  honoured the fair damsel; and having given him instructions accordingly,  and prohibited the other servants, on pretence of resenting Pamela's  behaviour, from accompanying her any part of the road, he drove her  five miles on the way to "]]]
