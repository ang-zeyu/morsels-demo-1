I knew you meant to croak Donnegan.\"    \"Me croak him? Why should I croak him?\"    \"Because you been trailing him two thousand miles. Because you ain't got  the nerve to meet him face to face and you got to sneak in and take a  crack at him while he's lying asleep. That's you, Lefty Joe!\"    He saw Lefty sway toward him; but, all stories aside, it is a very bold  tramp that cares for argument of a serious nature with a brakie. And  even Lefty Joe was deterred from violent action. In the darkness his  upper lip twitched, but he carefully smoothed his voice.    \"You don't know nothing, pal,\" he declared.    \"Don't I?\"    \"Nothing,\" repeated Lefty.    He reached into his clothes and produced something which rustled in the  rush of wind. He fumbled, and finally passed a scrap of the paper into  the hand of the brakie.    \"My heavens,\" drawled the latter. \"D'you think you can fix me with a  buck for a job like this? You can't bribe me to stand around while you  bump off Donnegan. Can't be done, Lefty!\"    \"One buck, did you say?\"    Lefty Joe expertly lighted a match in spite of the roaring wind, and by  this wild light the brakie read the denomination of the bill with a  gasp. He rolled up his face and was in time to catch the sneer on the  face of Lefty before a gust snatched away the light of the match.    They had topped the highest point in Jericho Pass and now the long train  dropped into the down grade with terrific speed. The wind became a  hurricane. But to the brakie all this was no more than a calm night. His  thoughts were raging in him, and if he looked back far enough he  remembered the dollar which Donnegan had given him; and how he had  promised Donnegan to give the warning before anything went wrong. He  thought of this, but rustling against the palm of his right hand was  the bill whose denomination he had read, and that figure ate into his  memory, ate into his brain.    After all what was Donnegan to him? What was Donnegan but a worthless  tramp? Without any answer to that last monosyllabic query, the brakie  hunched forward, and began to work his way up the train.    The tramp watched him go with laughter. It was silent laughter. In the  most quiet room it would not have sounded louder than a continual, light  hissing noise. Then he, in turn, moved from his place, and worked his  way along the train in the opposite direction to that in which the  brakie had disappeared.    He went expertly, swinging from car to car with apelike clumsiness--and  surety. Two cars back. It was not so easy to reach the sliding side door  of that empty car. Considering the fact that it was night, that the  train was bucking furiously over the old roadbed, Lefty had a not  altogether simple task before him. But he managed it with the same  apelike adroitness. He could climb with his feet as well as his hands.  He would trust a ledge as well as he would trust the rung of a ladder.    Under his discreet manipulations from above the door loosened and it  became possible to work it back. But even this the tramp did with  considerable care. He took advantage of the lurching of the train, and  every time the car jerked he forced the door to roll a little, so that  it might seem for all the world as though the motion of the train alone  were operating it.    For suppose that Donnegan wakened out of his sound sleep and observed  the motion of the door; he would be suspicious if the door opened in a  single continued motion; but if it worked in these degrees he would be  hypersuspicious if he dreamed of danger. So the tramp gave five whole  minutes to that work.    When it was done he waited for a time, another five minutes, perhaps, to  see if the door would be moved back. And when it was not disturbed, but  allowed to stand open, he knew that Donnegan still slept.    It was time then for action, and Lefty Joe prepared for the descent into  the home of the enemy. Let it not be thought that he approached this  moment with a fallen heart, and with a cringing, snaky feeling as a man  might be expected to feel when he approached to murder a sleeping  foeman. For that was not Lefty's emotion at all. Rather he was overcome  by a tremendous happiness. He could have sung with joy at the thought  that he was about to rid himself of this pest.    True, the gang was broken up. But it might rise again. Donnegan had  fallen upon it like a blight. But with Donnegan out of the way would not  Suds come back to him instantly? And would not Kennebec Lou himself  return in admiration of a man who had done what he, Kennebec, could not  do? With those two as a nucleus, how greatly might he not build!    Justice must be done to Lefty Joe. He approached this murder as a  statesman approaches the removal of a foe from the path of public  prosperity. There was no more rancor in his attitude. It was rather the  blissful largeness of the heart that comes to the politician when he  unearths the scandal which will blight the race of his rival.    With the peaceful smile of a child, therefore, Lefty Joe lay stretched  at full length along the top of the car and made his choice of weapons.  On the whole, his usual preference, day or night, was for a revolver.  Give him a gat and Lefty was at home in any company. But he had reasons  for transferring his alliance on this occasion. In the first place, a  box car which is reeling and pitching to and fro, from side to side, is  not a very good shooting platform--even for a snapshot like Lefty Joe.  Also, the pitch darkness in the car would be a further annoyance to good  aim. And in the third and most decisive place, if he were to miss his  first shot he would not be extremely apt to place his second bullet. For  Donnegan had a reputation with his own revolver. Indeed, it was said  that he rarely carried the weapon, because when he did he was always  tempted too strongly to use it. So that the chances were large that  Donnegan would not have the gun now. Yet if he did have it--if he,  Lefty, did miss his first shot--then the story would be brief and bitter  indeed.    On the other hand, a knife offered advantages almost too numerous to be  listed. It gave one the deadly assurance which only comes with the  knowledge of an edge of steel in one's hand. And when the knife reaches  its mark it ends a battle at a stroke.    Of course these doubts and considerations pro and con went through the  mind of the tramp in about the same space of time that it requires for a  dog to waken, snap at a fly, and drowse again. Eventually, he took out  his knife. It was a sheath knife which he wore from a noose of silk  around his throat, and it always lay closest to his heart. The blade of  the knife was of the finest Spanish steel, in the days when Spanish  smiths knew how to draw out steel to a streak of light; the handle of  the knife was from Milan. On the whole, it was a delicate and beautiful  weapon--and it had the durable suppleness of--say--hatred itself.    Lefty Joe, like a pirate in a tale, took this weapon between his teeth;  allowed his squat, heavy bulk to swing down and dangle at arm's length  for an instant, and then he swung himself a little and landed softly on  the floor of the car.    Who has not heard snow drop from the branch upon other snow beneath?  That was the way Lefty Joe dropped to the floor of the car. He remained  as he had fallen; crouched, alert, with one hand spread out on the  boards to balance him and give him a leverage and a start in case he  should wish to spring in any direction.    Then he began to probe the darkness in every direction; with every  glance he allowed his head to dart out a little. The movement was like a  chicken pecking at imaginary grains of corn. But eventually he satisfied  himself that his quarry lay in the forward end of the car; that he was  prone; that he, Lefty, had accomplished nine-tenths of his purpose by  entering the place of his enemy unobserved.          3      But even though this major step was accomplished successfully, Lefty Joe  was not the man to abandon caution in the midst of an enterprise. The  roar of the train would have covered sounds ten times as loud as those  of his snaky approach, yet he glided forward with as much care as though  he were stepping on old stairs in a silent house. He could see a vague  shadow--Donnegan; but chiefly he worked by that peculiar sense of  direction which some people possess in a dim light. The blind, of  course, have that sense in a high degree of sensitiveness, but even  those who are not blind may learn to trust the peculiar and inverted  sense of direction.    With this to aid him, Lefty Joe went steadily, slowly across the first  and most dangerous stage of his journey. That is, he got away from the  square of the open door, where the faint starlight might vaguely serve  to silhouette his body. After this, it was easier work.    Of course, when he alighted on the floor of the car, the knife had been  transferred from his teeth to his left hand; and all during his progress  forward the knife was being balanced delicately, as though he were not  yet quite sure of the weight of the weapon. Just as a prize fighter  keeps his deadly, poised hands in play, moving them as though he fears  to lose his intimate touch with them.    This stalking had occupied a matter of split seconds. Now Lefty Joe rose  slowly. He was leaning very far forward, and he warded against the roll  of the car by spreading out his right hand close to the floor; his left  hand he poised with the knife, and he began to gather his muscles for  the leap. He had already taken the last preliminary movement--he had  swung himself to the right side a little and, lightening his left foot,  had thrown all his weight upon the right--in fact, his body was  literally suspended in the instant of springing, catlike, when the  shadow which was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#2)"],[1," must prove what seem'd to thee.  If not from side to side this rarity  Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence  Its contrary no further lets it pass.  And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,  Must be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glass  Reflected, which behind it lead conceals.  Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue  Than in the other part the ray is shown,  By being thence refracted farther back.  From this perplexity will free thee soon  Experience, if thereof thou trial make,  The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.  Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove  From thee alike, and more remote the third.  Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;  Then turn'd toward them, cause behind thy back  A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,  And thus reflected come to thee from all.  Though that beheld most distant do not stretch  A space so ample, yet in brightness thou  Will own it equaling the rest.  But now,  As under snow the ground, if the warm ray  Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue  And cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,  Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform  With light so lively, that the tremulous beam  Shall quiver where it falls.  Within the heaven,  Where peace divine inhabits, circles round  A body, in whose virtue dies the being  Of all that it contains.  The following heaven,  That hath so many lights, this being divides,  Through  different essences, from it distinct,  And yet contain'd within it.  The other orbs  Their separate distinctions variously  Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt.  Thus do these organs of the world proceed,  As thou beholdest now, from step to step,  Their influences from above deriving,  And thence transmitting downwards.  Mark me well,  How through this passage to the truth I ford,  The truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,  May'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.    \"The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,  As mallet by the workman's hand, must needs  By blessed movers be inspir'd.  This heaven,  Made beauteous by so many luminaries,  From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,  Its image takes an impress as a seal:  And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,  Through members different, yet together form'd,  In different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en so  The intellectual efficacy unfolds  Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;  On its own unity revolving still.  Different virtue compact different  Makes with the precious body it enlivens,  With which it knits, as life in you is knit.  From its original nature full of joy,  The virtue mingled through the body shines,  As joy through pupil of the living eye.  From hence proceeds, that which from light to light  Seems different, and not from dense or rare.  This is the formal cause, that generates  Proportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear.\"          CANTO III    That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'd  Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect,  By proof of right, and of the false reproof;  And I, to own myself convinc'd and free  Of doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my head  Erect for speech.  But soon a sight appear'd,  Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd,  That of confession I no longer thought.    As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave  Clear and unmov'd, and flowing not so deep  As that its bed is dark, the shape returns  So faint of our impictur'd lineaments,  That on white forehead set a pearl as strong  Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,  All stretch'd to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'd  Delusion opposite to that, which rais'd  Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.    Sudden, as I perceiv'd them, deeming these  Reflected semblances to see of whom  They were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;  Then turn'd them back, directed on the light  Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams  From her celestial eyes.  \"Wonder not thou,\"  She cry'd, \"at this my smiling, when I see  Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth  It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,  Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.  True substances are these, which thou behold'st,  Hither through failure of their vow exil'd.  But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,  That the true light, which fills them with desire,  Permits not from its beams their feet to stray.\"    Straight to the shadow which for converse seem'd  Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,  As one by over-eagerness perplex'd:  \"O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays  Of life eternal, of that sweetness know'st  The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far  All apprehension, me it well would please,  If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this  Your station here.\" Whence she, with kindness prompt,  And eyes glist'ning with smiles: \"Our charity,  To any wish by justice introduc'd,  Bars not the door, no more than she above,  Who would have all her court be like herself.  I was a virgin sister in the earth;  And if thy mind observe me well, this form,  With such addition grac'd of loveliness,  Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know  Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,  Here 'mid these other blessed also blest.  Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone  With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,  Admitted to his order dwell in joy.  And this condition, which appears so low,  Is for this cause assign'd us, that our vows  Were in some part neglected and made void.\"    Whence I to her replied: \"Something divine  Beams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,  From former knowledge quite transmuting you.  Therefore to recollect was I so slow.  But what thou sayst hath to my memory  Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms  Is easier.  Yet inform me, ye, who here  Are happy, long ye for a higher place  More to behold, and more in love to dwell?\"    She with those other spirits gently smil'd,  Then answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'd  With love's first flame to glow: \"Brother! our will  Is in composure settled by the power  Of charity, who makes us will alone  What we possess, and nought beyond desire;  If we should wish to be exalted more,  Then must our wishes jar with the high will  Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs  Thou wilt confess not possible, if here  To be in charity must needs befall,  And if her nature well thou contemplate.  Rather it is inherent in this state  Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within  The divine will, by which our wills with his  Are one.  So that as we from step to step  Are plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases all,  E'en as our King, who in us plants his will;  And in his will is our tranquillity;  It is the mighty ocean, whither tends  Whatever it creates and nature makes.\"    Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n  Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew  The supreme virtue show'r not over all.    But as it chances, if one sort of food  Hath satiated, and of another still  The appetite remains, that this is ask'd,  And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I  In word and motion, bent from her to learn  What web it was, through which she had not drawn  The shuttle to its point.  She thus began:  \"Exalted worth and perfectness of life  The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,  By whose pure laws upon your nether earth  The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,  That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep  With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,  Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.  from the world, to follow her, when young  Escap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,  Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.  Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,  Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.  God knows how after that my life was fram'd.  This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst  At my right side, burning with all the light  Of this our orb, what of myself I tell  May to herself apply.  From her, like me  A sister, with like violence were torn  The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.  E'en when she to the world again was brought  In spite of her own will and better wont,  Yet not for that the bosom's inward veil  Did she renounce.  This is the luminary  Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,  Which blew the second over Suabia's realm,  That power produc'd, which was the third and last.\"    She ceas'd from further talk, and then began  \"Ave Maria\" singing, and with that song  Vanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave.    Mine eye, that far as it was capable,  Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,  Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,  And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.  But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:  So that the sight sustain'd it not at first.  Whence I to question her became less prompt.          CANTO IV    Between two kinds of food, both equally  Remote and tempting, first a man might die  Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose.  E'en so would stand a lamb between the maw  Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:  E'en so between two deer a dog would stand,  Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise  I to myself impute, by equal doubts  Held in suspense, since of necessity  It happen'd.  Silent was I, yet desire  Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake  My wish more earnestly than language could.    As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed  From ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust  And violent; so look'd Beatrice then.    \"Well I discern,\" she thus her words address'd,  \"How contrary desires each way constrain thee,  So that thy anxious thought is in itself  Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.  Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;  What reason that another's violence  Should stint the measure of my fair desert?    \"Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,  That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem'd,  Return.  These are the questions which thy will  Urge equally; and"]]]
