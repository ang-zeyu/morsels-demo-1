And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,    My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,    Not Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,    Not all my brothel's gasping on the shore,    As thine, Andromache! thy griefs I dread.      \"I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!    In Argive looms our battles to design,    And woes, of which so large a part was thine!    To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring    The weight of waters from Hype'ria's spring.    There, while you groan beneath the load of life,    They cry: 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'    Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,    Embitters all thy woes by naming me.    The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,    A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!    May I lie cold before that dreadful day,    Pressed with a load of monumental clay!    Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,    Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.\"      Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy    Stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.    The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,    Scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest.    With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,    And Hector hasted to relieve his child;    The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,    And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.    Then kissed the child, and, lifting high in air,    Thus to the gods preferred a father's prayer:      \"O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,    And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!    Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,    To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,    Against his country's foes the war to wage,    And rise the Hector of the future age!    So when triumphant from successful toils,    Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,    Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,    And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame;'    While pleased, amidst the general shouts of Troy,    His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.\"      He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,    Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;    Soft on her fragrant breast the babe he laid,    Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.    The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,    She mingled with the smile a tender tear.    The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,    And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:      \"Andromache, my soul's far better part,    Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?    No hostile hand can antedate my doom,    Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.    Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;    And such the hard condition of our birth,    No force can then resist, no flight can save--    All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.    No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,    There guide the spindle and direct the loom:    Me, glory summons to the martial scene--    The field of combat is the sphere of men;    Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,    The first in danger, as the first in fame.\"      Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes    His towery helmet black with shading plumes.    His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,    Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye,    That stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,    Sought her own palace and indulged her woe.    There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,    Through all her train the soft infection ran:    The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,    And mourn the living Hector as the dead.      --B. VI. POPE'S. Trans.      HECTOR'S EXPLOITS, AND DEATH OF PATRO'CLUS.    Hector hastened to the field, and there his exploits aroused the  enthusiasm and courage of his countrymen; who drove back the  Grecian hosts. Disheartened, the Greeks sent Ulysses and Ajax  to Achilles to plead with that warrior for his return with his  forces to the Grecian camp. But Achilles obstinately refused to  take part in the conflict, which was continued with varying  success, until the Trojans succeeded in breaking through the  Grecian wall, and attempted to fire the Greek ships, which were  saved by the valor of Ajax. In compliance with the request of  the aged Nestor, however, of whom the poet YOUNG tells us that--      When Nestor spoke, none asked if he prevailed;    That god of sweet persuasion never failed--    Achilles now placed his own armor on Patroclus, and, giving him  also his shield, sent him to the aid of the Greeks. The Trojans,  supposing Patroclus to be the famous Achilles, became panic-stricken,  and were pursued with great slaughter to the walls of Troy.    Apollo now goes to the aid of the Trojans, smites Patroclus,  whose armor is strewn on the plain, and then the hero is killed  by Hector, who proudly places the plume of Achilles on his own  helmet.      His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield    Drops from his arm; his baldric strews the field;    The corslet his astonished breast forsakes;    Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;    Stupid he stares, and all assistless stands:    Such is the force of more than mortal hands.      Achilles' plume is stained with dust and gore:    That plume which never stooped to earth before,    Long used, untouched, in fighting fields to shine,    And shade the temples of the mad divine.    Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;    Not long--for fate pursues him, and the god.      --B. XVI.    Then ensued a most terrific conflict for the body of the slain  warrior, in which Ajax, Glaucus, Hector, AEneas, and Menelaus  participated, the latter finally succeeding in bearing it off  to the ships. The grief of Achilles over the body of his friend,  and at the loss of his wonderful armor, is represented as being  intense; and so great a blow to the Greeks was the loss of the  armor considered, that Vulcan formed for Achilles a new one, and  also a new shield. Homer's description of the latter piece of  marvelous workmanship--which is often referred to as a truthful  picture of the times, and especially of the advanced condition  of some of the arts and sciences in the Heroic, or post-Heroic,  age--is too long for insertion here entire; but we proceed to  give sufficient extracts from it to show at least the magnificent  conception of the poet.      How Vulcan Formed the Shield of Achilles.      He first a vast and massive buckler made;    There all the wonders of his work displayed,    With silver belt adorned, and triply wound,    Orb within orb, the border beaming round.    Five plates composed the shield; these Vulcan's art    Charged with his skilful mind each varied part.      There earth, there heaven appeared; there ocean flowed;    There the orbed moon and sun unwearied glowed;    There every star that gems the brow of night--    Ple'iads and Hy'ads, and O-ri'on's might;    The Bear, that, watchful in his ceaseless roll    Around the star whose light illumes the pole,    Still eyes Orion, nor e'er stoops to lave    His beams unconscious of the ocean wave.      There, by the god's creative power revealed,    Two stately cities filled with life the shield.    Here nuptials--solemn rites--and throngs of gay    Assembled guests; forth issuing filled the way.    Bright blazed the torches as they swept along    Through streets that rung with hymeneal song;    And while gay youths, swift circling round and round,    Danced to the pipe and harp's harmonious sound,    The women thronged, and wondering as they viewed,    Stood in each portal and the pomp pursued.      Next on the shield a forum met the view;    Two men, contending, there a concourse drew:    A citizen was slain; keen rose the strife--    'Twas compensation claim'd for loss of life.    This swore, the mulct for blood was strictly paid:    This, that the fine long due was yet delayed.    Both claim'd th' award and bade the laws decide;    And partial numbers, ranged on either side,    With eager clamors for decision call,    Till the feared heralds seat and silence all.    There the hoar elders, in their sacred place,    On seats of polished stone the circle grace;    Rise with a herald's sceptre, weigh the cause,    And speak in turn the sentence of the laws;    While, in the midst, for him to bear away    Who rightliest spoke, two golden talents lay.      The other city on the shield displayed    Two hosts that girt it, in bright mail arrayed;    Diverse their counsel: these to burn decide,    And those to seize, and all its wealth divide.    The town their summons scorned, resistance dared,    And secretly for ambush arms prepared.    Wife, grandsire, child, one soul alike in all,    Stand on the battlements and guard the wall.    Mars, Pallas, led their host: gold either god,    A golden radiance from their armor flowed.    Next, described as displayed on the shield, is a picture of spies  at a distance, an ambuscade, and a battle; the scene then changes  to ploughing and sowing, and the incidents connected with the  gathering of a bountiful harvest; then are introduced a vineyard,  the gathering of the grapes, and a merrymaking by the youths at  the close of the day; then we have a wild outlying scene of  herdsmen with their cattle, the latter attacked by two famished  lions, and the tumult that followed. The description closes as  follows:      Now the god's changeful artifice displayed    Fair flocks at pasture in a lovely glade;    And folds and sheltering stalls peeped up between,    And shepherd-huts diversified the scene.      Now on the shield a choir appear'd to move,    Whose flying feet the tuneful labyrinth wove;    Youths and fair girls there, hand in hand, advanced,    Timed to the song their steps, and gayly danced.    Round every maid light robes of linen flowed;    Round every youth a glossy tunic glowed;    Those wreathed with flowers, while from their partners hung    Swords that, all gold, from belts of silver"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#19)"],[1,"locked.\"    I descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the  bath; my feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself  against the iron banister. After having ascertained that the door  leading to the Loggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda  was now sitting on the bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green  velvet furs. When she made a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs  were her only covering. It made me start terribly, I don't know why?  I was like one condemned to death, who knows he is on the way to the  scaffold, and yet begins to tremble when he sees it.    \"Come, Gregor, take me on your arms.\"    \"You mean, mistress?\"    \"You are to carry me, don't you understand?\"    I lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined  hers around my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs  with her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her  foot sought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful  burden I was carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to  break down beneath it.    The bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft  quiet light from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their  broad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here  steps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which  occupied the center.    \"There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\" said Wanda,  as I let her down on the couch, \"go get it, and also bring the whip.\"    I flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress's  hands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot  which I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did  this very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again  and again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet  cushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and  there beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will  compelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in  that which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the truth  of this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last was full,  and Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and stood  before me like the goddess in the Tribuna.    At that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled  beauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees  before her, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.    My soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,  suddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in  Wanda.    She slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a  calmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was  intermingled. I could see her plunge into and rise out of the  crystalline water, and the wavelets which she herself raised played  about her like tender lovers.    Our nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is  more beautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more  beautiful than a Venus of stone.    And when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate  light rippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I  wrapped the linen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The  calm bliss remained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon  a footstool, she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak.  The lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body.  Her left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan  in the dark fur of the sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly  with the whip.    By chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite,  and I cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in  a picture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so  imaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that  its lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.    \"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.    I pointed to the mirror.    \"Ah, that is really beautiful,\" she exclaimed, \"too bad one can't  capture the moment and make it permanent.\"    \"And why not?\" I asked. \"Would not any artist, even the most famous,  be proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by  means of his brush.    \"The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to  the world,\" I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \"is  horrible--all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye  with its green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body.  The idea fills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the  hand of an artist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the  rest of us disappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace  of your having been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself  have long fallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\"    Wanda smiled.    \"Too bad, that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael,\" she  said, \"but, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our  little German might do?\" She pondered.    \"Yes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love  mixes his colors.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is  completely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with  red hair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt  to use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of  virginity. The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I  am. Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears  too soon.           *       *       *       *       *    Now she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her  insolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of  which I stand, jealously listening.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Are you mad, me--ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\"  she exclaimed and laughed again. \"Wait a moment, I will show you  another picture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you  shall copy it.\"    Her head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the  sunlight.    \"Gregor!\"    I hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.    \"Lead him to the bath,\" Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried  away.    A few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the  sable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and  stretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay  at her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand  played with the whip. \"Look at me,\" she said, \"with your deep,  fanatical look, that's it.\"    The painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his  beautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.    \"Well, how do you like the picture?\"    \"Yes, that is how I want to paint you,\" said the German, but it was  really not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the  weeping of a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.           *       *       *       *       *    The charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh  parts are painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible  under a few bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.    Wanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her  breast.    \"This picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is  simultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\"  explained the painter, who again had become pale as death.    \"And what will you call it?\" she asked, \"but what is the matter with  you, are you ill?\"    \"I am afraid--\" he answered with a consuming look fixed on the  beautiful woman in furs, \"but let us talk of the picture.\"    \"Yes, let us talk about the picture.\"    \"I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus  for the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world  of ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur  and her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a  beautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing  him, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves  her. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more  rapidly. I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays  with him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he  feels his blood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.    During the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers  into little pellets with which she bombards him.    \"I am glad you are in such good humor,\" said the painter, \"but your face  has lost the expression which I need for my picture.\"    \"The expression which you need for your picture,\" she replied,  smiling. \"Wait a moment.\"    She rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at  her with stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,  mingled with disgust and admiration.    While whipping me, Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel,  contemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.    \"Is this the expression you need for your picture?\" she exclaimed.  The painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her  eye.    \"It is the expression--\" he stammered, \"but I can't paint now--\"    \"What?\" said Wanda, scornfully, \"perhaps I can help you?\"    \"Yes--\" cried the German, as if taken with madness, \"whip me too.\"    \"Oh! With pleasure,\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \"but if  I am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\"    \"Whip me to death,\" cried the painter.    \"Will you let me tie you?\" she asked, smiling.    \""]]]
