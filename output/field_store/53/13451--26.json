It was well for Robin Hood that that same forester's head was spinning  with ale, or else he would never have taken another step. As it was, the  arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then he turned around  and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.    \"Ye said I was no archer,\" cried he aloud, \"but say so now again!\"    The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on  his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him from out of his  quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart's blood.  Then, before  the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into  the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much  heart, for each feared to suffer the death of his fellow; so presently  they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham  Town.    Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood.  Gone was all the joy  and brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within him, and  it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.    \"Alas!\" cried he, \"thou hast found me an archer that will make thy wife  to wring!  I would that thou hadst ne'er said one word to me, or that I  had never passed thy way, or e'en that my right forefinger had been  stricken off ere that this had happened! In haste I smote, but grieve I  sore at leisure!\"  And then, even in his trouble, he remembered the old  saw that \"What is done is done; and the egg cracked cannot be cured.\"    And so he came to dwell in the greenwood that was to be his home for  many a year to come, never again to see the happy days with the lads and  lasses of sweet Locksley Town; for he was outlawed, not only because he  had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the King's deer,  and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever  would bring him to the court of the King.    Now the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would bring this  knave Robin Hood to justice, and for two reasons: first, because he  wanted the two hundred pounds, and next, because the forester that Robin  Hood had killed was of kin to him.    But Robin Hood lay hidden in Sherwood Forest for one year, and in that  time there gathered around him many others like himself, cast out from  other folk for this cause and for that. Some had shot deer in hungry  wintertime, when they could get no other food, and had been seen in the  act by the foresters, but had escaped, thus saving their ears; some had  been turned out of their inheritance, that their farms might be added to  the King's lands in Sherwood Forest; some had been despoiled by a great  baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire--all, for one cause or  another, had come to Sherwood to escape wrong and oppression.    So, in all that year, fivescore or more good stout yeomen gathered about  Robin Hood, and chose him to be their leader and chief. Then they vowed  that even as they themselves had been despoiled they would despoil their  oppressors, whether baron, abbot, knight, or squire, and that from each  they would take that which had been wrung from the poor by unjust taxes,  or land rents, or in wrongful fines. But to the poor folk they would  give a helping hand in need and trouble, and would return to them that  which had been unjustly taken from them. Besides this, they swore never  to harm a child nor to wrong a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow; so  that, after a while, when the people began to find that no harm was  meant to them, but that money or food came in time of want to many a  poor family, they came to praise Robin and his merry men, and to tell  many tales of him and of his doings in Sherwood Forest, for they felt  him to be one of themselves.    Up rose Robin Hood one merry morn when all the birds were singing  blithely among the leaves, and up rose all his merry men, each fellow  washing his head and hands in the cold brown brook that leaped laughing  from stone to stone. Then said Robin, \"For fourteen days have we seen no  sport, so now I will go abroad to seek adventures forthwith.  But tarry  ye, my merry men all, here in the greenwood; only see that ye mind well  my call. Three blasts upon the bugle horn I will blow in my hour of  need; then come quickly, for I shall want your aid.\"    So saying, he strode away through the leafy forest glades until he had  come to the verge of Sherwood.  There he wandered for a long time,  through highway and byway, through dingly dell and forest skirts. Now he  met a fair buxom lass in a shady lane, and each gave the other a merry  word and passed their way; now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad,  to whom he doffed his cap, and who bowed sedately in return to the fair  youth; now he saw a fat monk on a pannier-laden ass; now a gallant  knight, with spear and shield and armor that flashed brightly in the  sunlight; now a page clad in crimson; and now a stout burgher from good  Nottingham Town, pacing along with serious footsteps; all these sights  he saw, but adventure found he none.  At last he took a road by the  forest skirts, a bypath that dipped toward a broad, pebbly stream  spanned by a narrow bridge made of a log of wood.  As he drew nigh this  bridge he saw a tall stranger coming from the other side. Thereupon  Robin quickened his pace, as did the stranger likewise, each thinking to  cross first.    \"Now stand thou back,\" quoth Robin, \"and let the better man cross  first.\"    \"Nay,\" answered the stranger, \"then stand back shine own self, for the  better man, I wet, am I.\"    \"That will we presently see,\" quoth Robin, \"and meanwhile stand thou  where thou art, or else, by the bright brow of Saint AElfrida, I will  show thee right good Nottingham play with a clothyard shaft betwixt thy  ribs.\"    \"Now,\" quoth the stranger, \"I will tan thy hide till it be as many  colors as a beggar's cloak, if thou darest so much as touch a string of  that same bow that thou holdest in thy hands.\"    \"Thou pratest like an ass,\" said Robin, \"for I could send this shaft  clean through thy proud heart before a curtal friar could say grace over  a roast goose at Michaelmastide.\"    \"And thou pratest like a coward,\" answered the stranger, \"for thou  standest there with a good yew bow to shoot at my heart, while I have  nought in my hand but a plain blackthorn staff wherewith to meet thee.\"    \"Now,\" quoth Robin, \"by the faith of my heart, never have I had a  coward's name in all my life before.  I will lay by my trusty bow and  eke my arrows, and if thou darest abide my coming, I will go and cut a  cudgel to test thy manhood withal.\"    \"Ay, marry, that will I abide thy coming, and joyously, too,\" quoth the  stranger; whereupon he leaned sturdily upon his staff to await Robin.    Then Robin Hood stepped quickly to the coverside and cut a good staff of  ground oak, straight, without new, and six feet in length, and came back  trimming away the tender stems from it, while the stranger waited for  him, leaning upon his staff, and whistling as he gazed round about.  Robin observed him furtively as he trimmed his staff, measuring him from  top to toe from out the corner of his eye, and thought that he had never  seen a lustier or a stouter man. Tall was Robin, but taller was the  stranger by a head and a neck, for he was seven feet in height.  Broad  was Robin across the shoulders, but broader was the stranger by twice  the breadth of a palm, while he measured at least an ell around the  waist.    \"Nevertheless,\" said Robin to himself, \"I will baste thy hide right  merrily, my good fellow\"; then, aloud, \"Lo, here is my good staff, lusty  and tough. Now wait my coming, an thou darest, and meet me an thou  fearest not. Then we will fight until one or the other of us tumble into  the stream by dint of blows.\"    \"Marry, that meeteth my whole heart!\" cried the stranger, twirling his  staff above his head, betwixt his fingers and thumb, until it whistled  again.    Never did the Knights of Arthur's Round Table meet in a stouter fight  than did these two.  In a moment Robin stepped quickly upon the bridge  where the stranger stood; first he made a feint, and then delivered a  blow at the stranger's head that, had it met its mark, would have  tumbled him speedily into the water. But the stranger turned the blow  right deftly and in return gave one as stout, which Robin also turned as  the stranger had done. So they stood, each in his place, neither moving  a finger's-breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given  and received by each in that time, till here and there were sore bones  and bumps, yet neither thought of crying \"Enough,\" nor seemed likely to  fall from off the bridge. Now and then they stopped to rest, and each  thought that he never had seen in all his life before such a hand at  quarterstaff. At last Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that  made his jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun.  So shrewd  was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's-breadth of falling  off the bridge, but he regained himself right quickly and, by a  dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to  flow. Then Robin grew mad with anger and smote with all his might at the  other. But the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked Robin,  and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the water, as  the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.    \"And where art thou now, my good lad?\" shouted the stranger, roaring  with laughter.    \"Oh, in the flood and floating adown with the tide,\" cried Robin, nor  could he forbear laughing himself at his sorry plight. Then, gaining his  feet, he waded to the bank, the little fish speeding hither and thither,  all frightened at his splashing.    \"Give me thy hand,\" cried he, when he had reached the bank. \"I must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#2)"],[1,"and Santa Fe traders with necessaries for  their journey; and there was an incessant hammering and banging from a  dozen blacksmiths' sheds, where the heavy wagons were being repaired,  and the horses and oxen shod. The streets were thronged with men,  horses, and mules. While I was in the town, a train of emigrant wagons  from Illinois passed through, to join the camp on the prairie, and  stopped in the principal street. A multitude of healthy children's faces  were peeping out from under the covers of the wagons. Here and there a  buxom damsel was seated on horseback, holding over her sunburnt face an  old umbrella or a parasol, once gaudy enough but now miserably faded.  The men, very sober-looking countrymen, stood about their oxen; and as I  passed I noticed three old fellows, who, with their long whips in their  hands, were zealously discussing the doctrine of regeneration. The  emigrants, however, are not all of this stamp. Among them are some of  the vilest outcasts in the country. I have often perplexed myself to  divine the various motives that give impulse to this strange migration;  but whatever they may be, whether an insane hope of a better condition  in life, or a desire of shaking off restraints of law and society, or  mere restlessness, certain it is that multitudes bitterly repent the  journey, and after they have reached the land of promise are happy  enough to escape from it.    In the course of seven or eight days we had brought our preparations  near to a close. Meanwhile our friends had completed theirs, and  becoming tired of Westport, they told us that they would set out in  advance and wait at the crossing of the Kansas till we should come up.  Accordingly R. and the muleteers went forward with the wagon and tent,  while the captain and his brother, together with Sorel, and a trapper  named Boisverd, who had joined them, followed with the band of horses.  The commencement of the journey was ominous, for the captain was  scarcely a mile from Westport, riding along in state at the head of his  party, leading his intended buffalo horse by a rope, when a tremendous  thunderstorm came on, and drenched them all to the skin. They hurried on  to reach the place, about seven miles off, where R. was to have had the  camp in readiness to receive them. But this prudent person, when he  saw the storm approaching, had selected a sheltered glade in the woods,  where he pitched his tent, and was sipping a comfortable cup of coffee,  while the captain galloped for miles beyond through the rain to look  for him. At length the storm cleared away, and the sharp-eyed trapper  succeeded in discovering his tent: R. had by this time finished his  coffee, and was seated on a buffalo robe smoking his pipe. The captain  was one of the most easy-tempered men in existence, so he bore his  ill-luck with great composure, shared the dregs of the coffee with his  brother, and lay down to sleep in his wet clothes.    We ourselves had our share of the deluge. We were leading a pair of  mules to Kansas when the storm broke. Such sharp and incessant flashes  of lightning, such stunning and continuous thunder, I have never known  before. The woods were completely obscured by the diagonal sheets of  rain that fell with a heavy roar, and rose in spray from the ground; and  the streams rose so rapidly that we could hardly ford them. At length,  looming through the rain, we saw the log-house of Colonel Chick, who  received us with his usual bland hospitality; while his wife, who,  though a little soured and stiffened by too frequent attendance on  camp-meetings, was not behind him in hospitable feeling, supplied us  with the means of repairing our drenched and bedraggled condition. The  storm, clearing away at about sunset, opened a noble prospect from the  porch of the colonel's house, which stands upon a high hill. The sun  streamed from the breaking clouds upon the swift and angry Missouri, and  on the immense expanse of luxuriant forest that stretched from its banks  back to the distant bluffs.    Returning on the next day to Westport, we received a message from the  captain, who had ridden back to deliver it in person, but finding that  we were in Kansas, had intrusted it with an acquaintance of his named  Vogel, who kept a small grocery and liquor shop. Whisky by the way  circulates more freely in Westport than is altogether safe in a place  where every man carries a loaded pistol in his pocket. As we passed this  establishment, we saw Vogel's broad German face and knavish-looking eyes  thrust from his door. He said he had something to tell us, and  invited us to take a dram. Neither his liquor nor his message was very  palatable. The captain had returned to give us notice that R., who  assumed the direction of his party, had determined upon another route  from that agreed upon between us; and instead of taking the course of  the traders, to pass northward by Fort Leavenworth, and follow the path  marked out by the dragoons in their expedition of last summer. To adopt  such a plan without consulting us, we looked upon as a very high-handed  proceeding; but suppressing our dissatisfaction as well as we could, we  made up our minds to join them at Fort Leavenworth, where they were to  wait for us.    Accordingly, our preparation being now complete, we attempted one fine  morning to commence our journey. The first step was an unfortunate one.  No sooner were our animals put in harness, than the shaft mule reared  and plunged, burst ropes and straps, and nearly flung the cart into  the Missouri. Finding her wholly uncontrollable, we exchanged her  for another, with which we were furnished by our friend Mr. Boone of  Westport, a grandson of Daniel Boone, the pioneer. This foretaste of  prairie experience was very soon followed by another. Westport was  scarcely out of sight, when we encountered a deep muddy gully, of a  species that afterward became but too familiar to us; and here for the  space of an hour or more the car stuck fast.        CHAPTER II    BREAKING THE ICE      Both Shaw and myself were tolerably inured to the vicissitudes of  traveling. We had experienced them under various forms, and a birch  canoe was as familiar to us as a steamboat. The restlessness, the love  of wilds and hatred of cities, natural perhaps in early years to every  unperverted son of Adam, was not our only motive for undertaking the  present journey. My companion hoped to shake off the effects of a  disorder that had impaired a constitution originally hardy and robust;  and I was anxious to pursue some inquiries relative to the character and  usages of the remote Indian nations, being already familiar with many of  the border tribes.    Emerging from the mud-hole where we last took leave of the reader, we  pursued our way for some time along the narrow track, in the checkered  sunshine and shadow of the woods, till at length, issuing forth into  the broad light, we left behind us the farthest outskirts of that great  forest, that once spread unbroken from the western plains to the shore  of the Atlantic. Looking over an intervening belt of shrubbery, we saw  the green, oceanlike expanse of prairie, stretching swell over swell to  the horizon.    It was a mild, calm spring day; a day when one is more disposed to  musing and reverie than to action, and the softest part of his nature is  apt to gain the ascendency. I rode in advance of the party, as we passed  through the shrubbery, and as a nook of green grass offered a strong  temptation, I dismounted and lay down there. All the trees and saplings  were in flower, or budding into fresh leaf; the red clusters of the  maple-blossoms and the rich flowers of the Indian apple were there in  profusion; and I was half inclined to regret leaving behind the land of  gardens for the rude and stern scenes of the prairie and the mountains.    Meanwhile the party came in sight from out of the bushes. Foremost rode  Henry Chatillon, our guide and hunter, a fine athletic figure, mounted  on a hardy gray Wyandotte pony. He wore a white blanket-coat, a broad  hat of felt, moccasins, and pantaloons of deerskin, ornamented along the  seams with rows of long fringes. His knife was stuck in his belt; his  bullet-pouch and powder-horn hung at his side, and his rifle lay before  him, resting against the high pommel of his saddle, which, like all his  equipments, had seen hard service, and was much the worse for wear. Shaw  followed close, mounted on a little sorrel horse, and leading a larger  animal by a rope. His outfit, which resembled mine, had been provided  with a view to use rather than ornament. It consisted of a plain, black  Spanish saddle, with holsters of heavy pistols, a blanket rolled up  behind it, and the trail-rope attached to his horse's neck hanging  coiled in front. He carried a double-barreled smooth-bore, while I  boasted a rifle of some fifteen pounds' weight. At that time our attire,  though far from elegant, bore some marks of civilization, and offered a  very favorable contrast to the inimitable shabbiness of our appearance  on the return journey. A red flannel shirt, belted around the waist like  a frock, then constituted our upper garment; moccasins had supplanted  our failing boots; and the remaining essential portion of our attire  consisted of an extraordinary article, manufactured by a squaw out of  smoked buckskin. Our muleteer, Delorier, brought up the rear with his  cart, waddling ankle-deep in the mud, alternately puffing at his pipe,  and ejaculating in his prairie patois: \"Sacre enfant de garce!\" as  one of the mules would seem to recoil before some abyss of unusual  profundity. The cart was of the kind that one may see by scores around  the market-place in Montreal, and had a white covering to protect the  articles within. These were our provisions and a tent, with ammunition,  blankets, and presents for the Indians.    We were in all four men with eight animals;"]]]
