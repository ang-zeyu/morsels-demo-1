In each Episcopalian, Catholic, and  Dissenting community there are new some most erudite, most useful  men; but if we take the great multitude of them, and compare their  circumstances--their facilities for education, the varied channels  of usefulness they have--with those of their predecessors, it will  be found that the latter were the cleverer, often the wiser, and  always the merrier men. Plainness, erudition, blithesomeness, were  their characteristics. Aye, look at our modern men given up largely  to threnody-chiming and to polishing off tea and muffin with elderly  females, and compare them, say, for instance, with--    The poet Praed's immortal Vicar,  Who wisely wore the cleric gown,  Sound in theology and liquor;  Quite human, though a true divine,  His fellow-men he would not libel;  He gave his friends good honest wine,  And drew his doctrine from the Bible.    Institute a comparison, and then you will say that whilst modern men  may be very aesthetic and neatly dressed, the ancient apostolic  successors, though less refined, had much more metal in them, were  more kindly, genial; and told their followers to live well, to eat  well, and to mind none of the hair-splitting neological folly which  is now cracking up Christendom. In old times the Lord did not \"call\"  so many parsons from one church to another as it is said He does  now; in the days which have passed the bulk of subordinate parsons  did not feel a sort of conscientious hankering every three years for  an \"enlarged sphere of usefulness,\" where the salary was  proportionately increased. We have known multitudes of parsons, in  our time, who have been \"called\" to places where their salaries were  increased; we know of but few who have gravitated to a church where  the salary was less than the one left. \"Business\" enters largely  into the conceptions of clergymen. As a rule, no teachers of  religion, except Catholic priests and Methodist ministers, leave one  place for another where less of this world's goods and chattels  predominate; and THEY are COMPELLED to do so, else the result might  be different. When a priest gets his mittimus he has to budge; it is  not a question of \"he said or she said,\" but of--go; and when a  Wesleyan is triennially told to either look after the interests of a  fresh circuit or retire into space, he has to do so. It would be  wrong to say that lucre is at the bottom of every parsonic change;  but it is at the foundation of the great majority--eh? If it isn't,  just make an inquiry, as we have done. This may sound like a  deviation from our text--perhaps it is; but the question it refers  to is so closely associated with the subject of parsons and priests,  that we should have scarcely been doing justice to the matter if we  had not had a quiet \"fling\" at the money part of it. In the letters  which will follow this, we shall deal disinterestedly with all--  shall give Churchmen, Catholics, Quakers, Independents, Baptists,  Wesleyans, Ranters, and Calathumpians, fair play. Our object will be  to present a picture of things as they are, and to avoid all  meddling with creeds. People may believe what they like, so far as  we are concerned, if they behave themselves, and pay their debts. It  is utterly impossible to get all to be of the same opinion; creeds,  like faces, must differ, have differed, always will differ; and the  best plan is to let people have their own way so long as it is  consistent with the general welfare of social and civil life. It  being understood that \"the milk of human kindness is within the PALE  of the Church,\" we shall begin there. The Parish Church of Preston  will constitute our first theme.        No. I.        PRESTON PARISH CHURCH.        It doesn't particularly matter when the building we call our Parish  Church was first erected; and, if it did, the world would have to  die of literary inanition before it got the exact date. None of the  larger sort of antiquaries agree absolutely upon the subject, and  the smaller fry go in for all sorts of figures, varying as to time  from about two years to one hundred and fifty. This may be taken as  a homoeopathic dose in respect to its history:- built about 900  years since by Catholics, and dedicated to St. Wilfrid; handed over  to Protestants by somebody, who was perhaps acting on the very  generous principle of giving other folk's property, in the 16th  century; rebuilt in 1581, and dedicated to St. John; rebuilt in  1770; enlarged, elaborated, and rejuvenised in 1853; plagued with  dry rot for a considerable time afterwards; in a pretty good state  of architectural health now; and likely to last out both this  generation and the next. It looks rather genteel and stately  outside; it has a good steeple, kept duly alive by a congregation of  traditional jackdaws; it has a capital set of bells which have put  in a good deal of overtime during the past five months, through a  pressure of election business; and in its entirety, as Baines once  remarked, the building looks like \"a good ordinary Parish Church.\"  There is nothing either snobbish or sublime about it; and, speaking  after Josh Billings, \"it's a fair even-going critter,\" capable of  being either pulled down or made bigger. That is about the length  and breadth of the matter, and if we had to appeal to the  commonwealth as to the correctness of our position it would be found  that the \"ayes have it.\" We don't believe in the Parish Church; but  a good deal of people do, and why shouldn't they have their way in a  small fight as well as the rest of folk? All, except Mormons and  Fenians, who honestly believe in anything, are entitled to respect.    Our Parish Church has a good contour, and many of its exterior  architectural details are well conceived and arranged; but, like  other buildings of the same order, it has got a multiplicity of  strange hobgoblin figure-heads about it which serve no purpose  either earthly or heavenly, and which are understood by hardly one  out of five million. We could never yet make it out why those  grotesque pieces of masonry--gargoyles, we believe, they are called-  -were fixed to any place of worship. Around our Parish Church and  half-way up the steeple, there are, at almost every angle and  prominence, rudely carved monstrosities, conspicuous for nothing but  their ineffable and heathenish ugliness. Huge eyes, great mouths,  immense tooth, savage faces and distorted bodies are their prime  characteristics. The man who invented this species of ecclesiastical  decoration must have been either mad or in \"the horrors.\" An evenly  balanced mind could never have thought of them, and why they should  he specially tacked to churches is a mystery in accordance with  neither King Solomon nor Cocker. The graveyard of our Parish Church  is, we dare say, something which very few people think of. We have  seen many such places in our time; but that in connection with our  Parish Church is about the grimmest specimen in the lot. It has a  barren, cold, dingy, unconsecrated look with it; and why it should  have we can't tell. Either ruffianism or neglect must at some time  have done a good stroke of business in it; for many of the  gravestones are cracked in two; some are nearly broken to pieces;  and a considerable number of those in the principal parts of the  yard are being gradually worn out. We see no fun, for instance, in  \"paving\" the entrances to the church with gravestones. Somebody  must, at some time, have paid a considerable amount of money in  getting the gravestones of their relatives smoothed and lettered;  and it could never have been intended that they should be flattened  down, close as tile work, for a promiscuous multitude of people to  walk over and efface. The back of the churchyard is in a very weary,  delapidated and melancholy state. Why can't a few shrubs and flowers  be planted in it? Why is not the ground trimmed up and made decent?  From the time when the Egyptians worshipped cats and onions down to  the present hour, religious folk have paid some special attention to  their grave spaces, and we want to see the custom kept up. Our  Parish Church yard has a sad, forsaken appearance; if it had run to  seed and ended in nothing, or had been neglected and closed up by an  army of hypochondriacs, it could not have been more gloomy, barren,  or disheartening. The ground should be looked after, and the stones  preserved as much as possible. It is a question of shoes v.  gravestones at present, and, if there is not some change of  position, the shoes will in the end win.    About the interior of our Parish Church there is nothing  particularly wonderful; it has a respectable, substantial,  reverential appearance, and that is quite as much as any church  should have. There is no emblematic ritualistic moonshine in any  part of it; we hope there never may be; we are sure there never will  be so long as the men now at the helm are in office. But let us  start at the beginning. The principal entrance is through a massive  and somewhat dimly-lighted porch, which, in its time, has  necessarily, like all church porches, been the scene of much pious  gossip, superstition, and sanctimonious scandal. It is rather a snug  place to halt in. If you stand on one side of the large octagonal  font, which is placed in the centre of the inner perch, and  patronised by about 20 of the rising race every Sunday afternoon,  you will be able to see everybody, whilst nobody can distinctly see  you. As a rule, many people are too fired, or too ill, or too idle,  to go to a place of worship on a Sunday morning, and at our Parish  Church one may plainly notice this. A certain number always put in a  regular appearance. If they did not attend the Parish Church twice a  day they would become apprehensive as to both their temporal  respectability awl spiritual welfare. They are descendants of the  old long-horned stock, and have a mighty notion of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#2)"],[1,"fences, since society cannot exist anywhere without such laws; but  there was no complicated jurisprudence produced by the friction of  competing classes striving for justice and right, or even for the  interests of contending parties. We do not look to Egypt or to China for  wise punishment of ordinary crimes; but we do look to Greece and Rome,  and to Rome especially, for a legislation which shall balance the  complicated relations of society on principles of enlightened reason.  Moreover, those great popular rights which we now most zealously defend  have generally been extorted in the strife of classes and parties,  sometimes from kings, and sometimes from princes and nobles. Where there  has been no opposition to absolutism these rights have not been secured;  but whenever and wherever the people have been a power they have  imperiously made their wants known, and so far as they have been  reasonable they have been finally secured,--perhaps after angry  expostulations and, disputations.    Now, it is this kind of legislation which is remarkable in the history  of Greece and Rome, secured by a combination of the people against the  ruling classes in the interests of justice and the common welfare, and  finally endorsed and upheld even by monarchs themselves. It is from this  legislation that modern nations have learned wisdom; for a permanent law  in a free country may be the result of a hundred years of discussion or  contention,--a compromise of parties, a lesson in human experience. As  the laws of Greece and Rome alone among the ancients are rich in moral  wisdom and adapted more or less to all nations and ages in the struggle  for equal rights and wise social regulations, I shall confine myself to  them. Besides, I aim not to give useless and curious details, but to  show how far in general the enlightened nations of antiquity made  attainments in those things which we call civilization, and particularly  in that great department which concerns so nearly all human  interests,--that of the regulation of mutual social relations; and this  by modes and with results which have had their direct influence upon our  modern times.    When we consider the native genius of the Greeks, and their marvellous  achievements in philosophy, literature, and art, we are surprised that  they were so inferior to the Romans in jurisprudence,--although in the  early days of the Roman republic a deputation of citizens was sent to  Athens to study the laws of Solon. But neither nations nor individuals  are great in everything. Before Solon lived, Lycurgus had given laws to  the Spartans. This lawgiver, one of the descendants of Hercules, was  born, according to Grote, about eight hundred and eighty years before  Christ, and was the uncle of the reigning king. There is, however, no  certainty as to the time when he lived; it was probably about the period  when Carthage was founded by the Phoenicians. He instituted the Spartan  senate, and gave an aristocratic form to the constitution. But the  senate, composed of about thirty old men who acted in conjunction with  the two kings, did not differ materially from the council of chiefs, or  old men, found in other ancient Grecian States; the Spartan chiefs  simply modified or curtailed the power of the kings. In the course of  time the senate, with the kings included in it, became the governing  body of the State, and this oligarchical form of government lasted  several hundred years. We know but little of the especial laws given by  Lycurgus. We know the distinctions of society,--citizens and helots,  and their mutual relations,--the distribution of lands to check luxury,  the public men, the public training of youth, the severe discipline to  which all were subjected, the cruelty exercised towards slaves, the  attention given to gymnastic exercises and athletic sports,--in short,  the habits and customs of the people rather than any regular system of  jurisprudence. Lycurgus was the trainer of a military brotherhood rather  than a law-giver. Under his regime the citizen belonged to the State  rather than to his family, and all the ends of the State were warlike  rather than peaceful,--not looking to the settlement of quarrels on  principles of equity, or a development of industrial interests, which  are the great aims of modern legislation.    The influence of the Athenian Solon on the laws which affected  individuals is more apparent than that of the Spartan Lycurgus, the  earliest of the Grecian legislators. But Solon had a predecessor in  Athens itself,--Draco, who in 624 was appointed to reduce to writing the  arbitrary decisions of the archons, thus giving a form of permanent law  and a basis for a court of appeal. Draco's laws were extraordinarily  severe, punishing small thefts and even laziness with death. The  formulation of any system of justice would have, as Draco's did, a  beneficial influence on the growth of the State; but the severity of  these bloody laws caused them to be hated and in practice neglected,  until Solon arose. Solon was born in Athens about 638 B.C., and  belonged to the noblest family of the State. He was contemporary with  Pisistratus and Thales. His father having lost his property, Solon  applied himself to merchandise,--always a respectable calling in a  mercantile city. He first became known as a writer of love poems; then  came into prominence as a successful military commander of volunteer  forces in a disastrous war; and at last he gained the confidence of his  countrymen so completely that in a period of anarchy, distress, and  mutiny,--the poor being so grievously oppressed by the rich that a sixth  part of the produce of land went to the landlord,--he was chosen archon,  with authority to revise the laws, and might have made himself king. He  abolished the custom of selling the body of a debtor for debt, and even  annulled debts in a state of general distress,--which did not please the  rich, nor even the poor, since they desired a redivision of lands such  as Lycurgus had made in Sparta. He repealed the severe laws of Draco,  which inflicted capital punishment for so many small offences, retaining  the extreme penalty only for murder and treason. In order further to  promote the interests of the people, he empowered any man whatever to  enter an action for one that was injured. He left the great offices of  state, however, in the hands of the rich, giving the people a share in  those which were not so important. He re-established the council of the  Areopagus, composed of those who had been archons, and nine were  appointed annually for the general guardianship of the laws; but he  instituted another court or senate of four hundred citizens, for the  cognizance of all matters before they were submitted to the higher  court. Although the poorest and most numerous class were not eligible  for office, they had the right of suffrage, and could vote for the  principal officers. It would at first seem that the legislation of Solon  gave especial privileges to the rich, but it is generally understood  that he was the founder of the democracy of Athens. He gave the  Athenians, not the best possible code, but the best they were capable of  receiving. He intended to give to the people as much power as was  strictly needed, and no more; but in a free State the people continually  encroach on the privileges of the rich, and thus gradually the chief  power falls into their hands.    Whatever the power which Solon gave to the people, and however great  their subsequent encroachments, it cannot be doubted that he was the  first to lay the foundations of constitutional government,--that is, one  in which the people took part in legislation and in the election of  rulers. The greatest benefit which he conferred on the State was in the  laws which gave relief to poor debtors, those which enabled people to  protect themselves by constitutional means, and those which prohibited  fathers from selling their daughters and sisters for slaves,--an  abomination which had long disgraced the Athenian republic.    Some of Solon's laws were of questionable utility. He prohibited the  exportation of the fruits of the soil in Attica, with the exception of  olive-oil alone,--a regulation difficult to be enforced in a mercantile  State. Neither would he grant citizenship to immigrants; and he released  sons from supporting their parents in old age if the parents had  neglected to give them a trade. He encouraged all developments of  national industries, knowing that the wealth of the State depended on  them. Solon was the first Athenian legislator who granted the power of  testamentary bequests when a man had no legitimate children. Sons  succeeded to the property of their parents, with the obligation of  giving a marriage dowry to their sisters. If there were no sons, the  daughters inherited the property of their parents; but a person who had  no children could bequeath his property to whom he pleased. Solon  prohibited costly sacrifices at funerals; he forbade evil-speaking of  the dead, and indeed of all persons before judges and archons; he  pronounced a man infamous who took part in a sedition.    When this enlightened and disinterested man had finished his work of  legislation, 494 B.C., he visited Egypt and Cyprus, and devoted his  leisure to the composition of poems. He also, it is said, when a  prisoner in the hands of the Persians, visited Croesus, the rich king of  Lydia, and gave to him an admonitory lesson on the vicissitudes of life.  After a prolonged absence, Solon returned to Athens about the time of  the usurpation of his kinsman Peisistratus (560 B.C.), who, however,  suffered the aged legislator and patriot to go unharmed, and even  allowed most of his laws to remain in force.    The constitution and laws of Athens continued substantially for about a  hundred years after the archonship of Solon, when the democratic party  under Cleisthenes gained"]]]
