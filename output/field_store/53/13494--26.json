Meyer); Volume XV  (Schopenhauer, Wagner, Nietzsche, Emperor William II.); Volume XVIII  (Gerhart Hauptmann, Detlev von Liliencron, Richard Dehmel). The last  two volumes will be devoted to the most recent of contemporary authors.    The editors have been fortunate in associating with themselves a  notable number of distinguished contributors from many universities  and colleges in this country and abroad. A general introduction to the  whole series has been written by Professor Richard M. Meyer of the  University of Berlin. The last two volumes will be in charge of  Professor Julius Petersen of the University of Basel. The  introductions to Goethe and Schiller have been prepared by Professor  Calvin Thomas, of Columbia University; that to the Romantic  Philosophers by Professor Frank Thilly, of Cornell University; that to  Richard Wagner by Professor W. R. Spalding, of Harvard University.  And, similarly, every important author in this collection will be  introduced by some authoritative and well known specialist.    The crux of the whole undertaking lies in the correctness and adequacy  of the translations. How difficult, if not impossible, a really  satisfactory translation is, especially in lyric poetry, no one  realizes more clearly than the editors. Their only comfort is that  they have succeeded in obtaining the assistance of many well trained  and thoroughly equipped scholars, among them such names of poets as  Hermann Hagedorn, Percy MacKaye, George Sylvester Viereck, and  Martin Schuetze.

PUBLISHERS' FOREWORD    The German Classics is the first work issued by The German Publication  Society in pursuance of a comprehensive plan to open to the  English-speaking people of the world the treasures of German thought  and achievement in Literature, Art and Science.    In the production of this monumental work the thanks and appreciation  of the Publishers are especially due to Hugo Reisinger, Esq., whose  loyal support and constant encouragement have made possible its  publication.      General Introduction    By Richard M. Meyer, Ph.D. Professor of German Literature, University  of Berlin.    Men formerly pictured the origin and development of a literature as an  order less play of incalculable forces; out of a seething chaos forms  more or less definite arose, and then, one day, behold! the literary  earth was there, with sun and moon, water and mountains, animals and  men. This conception was intimately connected with that of the origin  of individual literary compositions. These likewise--since the new  \"theory of genius,\" spreading from England, had gained recognition  throughout the whole of Europe, especially in those countries speaking  the Germanic languages--were imagined to be a mere succession of  inspirations and even of improvisations. This view of the subject can  no longer be held either wholly or in part, though in the origin and  growth of literature, as in every other origin and development, much  manifestly remains that is still incomprehensible and incalculable.  But even as regards the individual literary work, writers  themselves--as latterly Richard Dehmel--have laid almost too strong an  emphasis on the element of conscious deliberation. And concerning the  whole literary product of an individual, which seems to offer the most  instructive analogies to the literary achievement of a people, we  received a short time ago a remarkable opinion from Carl Spitteler. He  asserts that he is guided in his choice of definite styles and  definite forms by an absolutely clear purpose; that he has, for  example, essayed every kind of metre which could possibly be suited to  his \"cosmic\" epic, or that he has written a novelette solely in order  to have once written a novelette. Although in these confessions, as  well as in Edgar Allen Poe's celebrated _Poet's Art_, self-delusion  and pleasure in the paradoxical may very likely be mingled, it still  remains true that such dicta as these point to certain peculiarities  in the development of literatures. Experiments with all kinds of  forms, imitation of certain literary _genres_ without intrinsic  necessity, and deliberate selection of new species, play a larger part  in the history of modern German literature than people for a long time  wished to admit. It is true, however, that all this experimenting,  imitating, and speculating, in the end serves a higher necessity, as  well in the poet of genius as in a great literature.    Three kinds of forces virtually determine the general trend of all  artistic development as, indeed, of all other forms of  evolution--forces which constitute the sum total of those that we  comprehend under the joint name of _tradition_, a sum total of  progressive tendencies which we will designate as _esthetic ideals_,  and, mediating between the two, the _typical development of the  individuals themselves_--above all, naturally, individuals of genius  who really create literature.    These powers are present everywhere, but in very different proportion.  Characteristic of Romance literatures and also of the English, is the  great predominance of the conservative elements. Thus not only is the  literature of the constitutional mother-country democratic, but also  the literature of France, otherwise so decidedly aristocratic: a  majority dictates its laws to the distinguished individual and is  inclined to ostracize him, if too headstrong, and exile him from the  \"Republic of Letters.\" This, for instance, is what happened to Lord  Byron among the British. On the other hand, German literature, like  Germanic literatures in general, is disposed to concede, at least at  times, a dictatorial leadership to the individual, even at the cost of  tradition--as, for example, to a Klopstock, a Goethe, or a Richard  Wagner. But, in exchange, the leader is often forced to uphold his  power, no matter how much it may have been due to his achievements, by  coercive measures--as, again for example, by means of a praetorian  guard of partisans, such as Klopstock first created for himself in the  Goettinger \"Hain,\" but which was most effectively organized by Wagner,  and such as Victor Hugo, imitating the German model, possessed in the  Young Guard which applauded _Hernani_. Another method of enforcing his  mastery is the organization of a systematic reign of terror,  consisting of bitter satires, such as Schiller and Goethe (after the  model of Pope) founded in the _Xenien_, and the Romanticists  established in many different forms--satires much more personal and  much better aimed than was the general sort of mockery which the  Romance or Romanized imitators of Horace flung at Bavius and Maevius.  In saying all this, however, we have at the same time made it clear  that the power and influence of the individual of genius receives much  more positive expression in German literature than in those which  produced men like Corneille, Calderon, yes, even Dante and  Shakespeare. German literary history is, more than any other, occupied  with the _Individual_.    If we now try rapidly to comprehend to what extent each one of the  already enumerated literary forces has participated in the development  of modern German literature, we must, first of all, emphasize the fact  that here the question is, intrinsically, one of construction--of a  really new creation.    German literature since 1700 is not simply the continuation of former  literature with the addition of radical innovations, as is the case  with the literature of the same period in England, but was  systematically constructed on new theories--if it may be said that  nature and history systematically \"construct.\" A destruction, a  suspension of tradition, had taken place, such as no other civilized  nation has ever experienced in a like degree--in which connection the  lately much-disputed question as to whether the complete decay dates  from the time of the Thirty Years' War or the latter merely marks the  climax of a long period of decadence may be left to take care of  itself. In any event, about the year 1700 the literature of Germany  stood lower than that of any other nation, once in possession of a  great civilization and literature, has ever stood in recent times.  Everything, literally everything, had to be created _de novo_; and it  is natural that a nation which had to struggle for its very existence,  for which life itself had become a daily questioning of fate, could at  first think of renovation only through its conservative forces. Any  violent commotion in the religious or political, in the economic or  social, sphere, as well as in the esthetic, might prove fatal, or at  least appear to be so.    The strongest conservative factor of a literature is the language.  Upon its relative immutability depends, in general, the possibility of  literary compositions becoming the common possession of many  generations--depends absolutely all transmission. Especially is poetic  language wont to bear the stamp of constancy; convenient formulas,  obvious rhymes, established epithets, favorite metaphors, do not, in  periods of exhaustion, afford much choice in the matter of  phraseology. On the other hand, however, a new tenor of thought, often  enough a new tenor of feeling, is continually pressing forward to  demand a medium of expression. This battle between the established  linguistic form and the new content gives rise to charming, but at the  same time alarming, conflicts. In the seventeenth century it was felt  strongly how much the store of linguistic expression had diminished,  partly on account of a violent and careless \"working of the mine,\"  which made prodigal use of the existing medium, as was the case in the  prose of Luther and, above all, of Johann Fischart and his  contemporaries; partly on account of a narrow confinement to a small  number of ideas and words,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#2)"],[1,"ase, but, by degrees, my sphere of influence has extended until it now  includes all cases in which a special knowledge of medicine or physical  science can be brought to bear upon law.\"    \"But you plead in court, I observe,\" said I.    \"Very seldom,\" he replied. \"More usually I appear in the character of  that _bete noir_ of judges and counsel--the scientific witness. But in  most instances I do not appear at all; I merely direct investigations,  arrange and analyse the results, and prime the counsel with facts and  suggestions for cross-examination.\"    \"A good deal more interesting than acting as understudy for an absent  g.p.,\" said I, a little enviously. \"But you deserve to succeed, for you  were always a deuce of a worker, to say nothing of your capabilities.\"    \"Yes, I worked hard,\" replied Thorndyke, \"and I work hard still; but I  have my hours of labour and my hours of leisure, unlike you poor devils  of general practitioners, who are liable to be dragged away from the  dinner table or roused out of your first sleep by--confound it all! who  can that be?\"    For at this moment, as a sort of commentary on his self-congratulation,  there came a smart rapping at the outer door.    \"Must see who it is, I suppose,\" he continued, \"though one expects  people to accept the hint of a closed oak.\"    He strode across the room and flung open the door with an air of by no  means gracious inquiry.    \"It's rather late for a business call,\" said an apologetic voice  outside, \"but my client was anxious to see you without delay.\"    \"Come in, Mr. Lawley,\" said Thorndyke, rather stiffly, and, as he held  the door open, the two visitors entered. They were both men--one  middle-aged, rather foxy in appearance and of a typically legal aspect,  and the other a fine, handsome young fellow of very prepossessing  exterior, though at present rather pale and wild-looking, and evidently  in a state of profound agitation.    \"I am afraid,\" said the latter, with a glance at me and the dinner  table, \"that our visit--for which I am alone responsible--is a most  unseasonable one. If we are really inconveniencing you, Dr. Thorndyke,  pray tell us, and my business must wait.\"    Thorndyke had cast a keen and curious glance at the young man, and he  now replied in a much more genial tone--    \"I take it that your business is of a kind that will not wait, and as to  inconveniencing us, why, my friend and I are both doctors, and, as you  are aware, no doctor expects to call any part of the twenty-four hours  his own unreservedly.\"    I had risen on the entrance of the two strangers, and now proposed to  take a walk on the Embankment and return later, but the young man  interrupted me.    \"Pray don't go away on my account,\" he said. \"The facts that I am about  to lay before Dr. Thorndyke will be known to all the world by this time  to-morrow, so there is no occasion for any show of secrecy.\"    \"In that case,\" said Thorndyke, \"let us draw our chairs up to the fire  and fall to business forthwith. We had just finished our dinner and were  waiting for the coffee, which I hear my man bringing down at this  moment.\"    We accordingly drew up our chairs, and when Polton had set the coffee on  the table and retired, the lawyer plunged into the matter without  preamble.          CHAPTER II    THE SUSPECT      \"I had better,\" said he, \"give you a general outline of the case as it  presents itself to the legal mind, and then my client, Mr. Reuben  Hornby, can fill in the details if necessary, and answer any questions  that you may wish to put to him.    \"Mr. Reuben occupies a position of trust in the business of his uncle,  John Hornby, who is a gold and silver refiner and dealer in precious  metals generally. There is a certain amount of outside assay work  carried on in the establishment, but the main business consists in the  testing and refining of samples of gold sent from certain mines in South  Africa.    \"About five years ago Mr. Reuben and his cousin Walter--another nephew  of John Hornby--left school, and both were articled to their uncle, with  the view to their ultimately becoming partners in the house; and they  have remained with him ever since, occupying, as I have said, positions  of considerable responsibility.    \"And now for a few words as to how business is conducted in Mr. Hornby's  establishment. The samples of gold are handed over at the docks to some  accredited representative of the firm--generally either Mr. Reuben or  Mr. Walter--who has been despatched to meet the ship, and conveyed  either to the bank or to the works according to circumstances. Of course  every effort is made to have as little gold as possible on the premises,  and the bars are always removed to the bank at the earliest opportunity;  but it happens unavoidably that samples of considerable value have often  to remain on the premises all night, and so the works are furnished with  a large and powerful safe or strong room for their reception. This safe  is situated in the private office under the eye of the principal, and,  as an additional precaution, the caretaker, who acts as night-watchman,  occupies a room directly over the office, and patrols the building  periodically through the night.    \"Now a very strange thing has occurred with regard to this safe. It  happens that one of Mr. Hornby's customers in South Africa is interested  in a diamond mine, and, although transactions in precious stones form no  part of the business of the house, he has, from time to time, sent  parcels of rough diamonds addressed to Mr. Hornby, to be either  deposited in the bank or handed on to the diamond brokers.    \"A fortnight ago Mr. Hornby was advised that a parcel of stones had been  despatched by the _Elmina Castle_, and it appeared that the parcel was  an unusually large one and contained stones of exceptional size and  value. Under these circumstances Mr. Reuben was sent down to the docks  at an early hour in the hope the ship might arrive in time for the  stones to be lodged in the bank at once. Unfortunately, however, this  was not the case, and the diamonds had to be taken to the works and  locked up in the safe.\"    \"Who placed them in the safe?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"Mr. Hornby himself, to whom Mr. Reuben delivered up the package on his  return from the docks.\"    \"Yes,\" said Thorndyke, \"and what happened next?\"    \"Well, on the following morning, when the safe was opened, the diamonds  had disappeared.\"    \"Had the place been broken into?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"No. The place was all locked up as usual, and the caretaker, who had  made his accustomed rounds, had heard nothing, and the safe was,  outwardly, quite undisturbed. It had evidently been opened with keys and  locked again after the stones were removed.\"    \"And in whose custody were the keys of the safe?\" inquired Thorndyke.    \"Mr. Hornby usually kept the keys himself, but, on occasions, when he  was absent from the office, he handed them over to one of his  nephews--whichever happened to be in charge at the time. But on this  occasion the keys did not go out of his custody from the time when he  locked up the safe, after depositing the diamonds in it, to the time  when it was opened by him on the following morning.\"    \"And was there anything that tended to throw suspicion upon anyone?\"  asked Thorndyke.    \"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Lawley, with an uncomfortable glance at his client,  \"unfortunately there was. It seemed that the person who abstracted the  diamonds must have cut or scratched his thumb or finger in some way, for  there were two drops of blood on the bottom of the safe and one or two  bloody smears on a piece of paper, and, in addition, a remarkably clear  imprint of a thumb.\"  \"Also in blood?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"Yes. The thumb had apparently been put down on one of the drops and  then, while still wet with blood, had been pressed on the paper in  taking hold of it or otherwise.\"    \"Well, and what next?\"    \"Well,\" said the lawyer, fidgeting in his chair, \"to make a long story  short, the thumb-print has been identified as that of Mr. Reuben  Hornby.\"    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Thorndyke. \"The plot thickens with a vengeance. I had  better jot down a few notes before you proceed any further.\"    He took from a drawer a small paper-covered notebook, on the cover of  which he wrote \"Reuben Hornby,\" and then, laying the book open on a  blotting-pad, which he rested on his knee, he made a few brief notes.    \"Now,\" he said, when he had finished, \"with reference to this  thumb-print. There is no doubt, I suppose, as to the identification?\"    \"None whatever,\" replied Mr. Lawley. \"The Scotland Yard people, of  course, took possession of the paper, which was handed to the director  of the finger-print department for examination and comparison with those  in their collection. The report of the experts is that the thumb-print  does not agree with any of the thumb-prints of criminals in their  possession; that it is a very peculiar one, inasmuch as the  ridge-pattern on the bulb of the thumb--which is a remarkably distinct  and characteristic one--is crossed by the scar of a deep cut, rendering  identification easy and infallible; that it agrees in every respect with  the thumb-print of Mr. Reuben Hornby, and is, in fact, his thumb-print  beyond any possible doubt.\"    \"Is there any possibility,\" asked Thorndyke, \"that the paper bearing the  thumb-print could have been introduced by any person?\"    \"No,\" answered the lawyer. \"It is quite impossible. The paper on which  the mark was found was a leaf from Mr. Hornby's memorandum block. He had  pencilled on it some particulars relating to the diamonds, and laid it  on the parcel before he closed up the safe.\"    \"Was anyone present when Mr. Hornby opened the safe in the morning?\"  asked Thorndyke.    \"No, he was alone,\" answered the lawyer. \"He saw at a glance that the  diamonds were missing, and then he observed the paper with the  thumb-mark on it, on"]]]
