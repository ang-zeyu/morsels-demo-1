With many kinds of plants, the radicle, whilst still enclosed within the  seed and likewise after its first protrusion, lies in a straight line with  the future hypocotyl and with the longitudinal axis of the cotyledons. This  is the case with Cucurbita ovifera: nevertheless, in whatever position the  seeds were buried, the hypocotyl always came up arched in one particular  direction. Seeds were planted in friable peat at a depth of about an inch  in a vertical position, with the end from which the radicle protrudes  downwards. Therefore all the parts occupied the same relative positions  which they would ultimately hold after the seedlings had risen clear above  the surface. Notwithstanding this fact, the hypocotyl arched itself; and as  the arch grew upwards through the peat, the buried seeds were turned either  upside down, or were laid horizontally, being afterwards dragged above the  ground. Ultimately the hypocotyl straightened itself in the usual manner;  and now after all these movements the several parts occupied the same  position relatively to one another and to the centre of the earth, which  they  [page 90]  had done when the seeds were first buried. But it may be argued in this and  other such cases that, as the hypocotyl grows up through the soil, the seed  will almost certainly be tilted to one side; and then from the resistance  which it must offer during its further elevation, the upper part of the  hypocotyl will be doubled down and thus become arched. This view seems the  more probable, because with Ranunculus ficaria only the petioles of the  leaves which forced a passage through the earth were arched; and not those  which arose from the summits of the bulbs above the ground. Nevertheless,  this explanation does not apply to the Cucurbita, for when germinating  seeds were suspended in damp air in various positions by pins passing  through the cotyledons, fixed to the inside of the lids of jars, in which  case the hypocotyls were not subjected to any friction or constraint, yet  the upper part became spontaneously arched. This fact, moreover, proves  that it is not the weight of the cotyledons which causes the arching. Seeds  of Helianthus annuus and of two species of Ipomoea (those of 'I. bona nox'  being for the genus large and heavy) were pinned in the same manner, and  the hypocotyls became spontaneously arched; the radicles, which had been  vertically dependent, assumed in consequence a horizontal position. In the  case of Ipomoea leptophylla it is the petioles of the cotyledons which  become arched whilst rising through the ground; and this occurred  spontaneously when the seeds were fixed to the lids of jars.    It may, however, be suggested with some degree of probability that the  arching was aboriginally caused by mechanical compulsion, owing to the  confinement of the parts in question within the seed-coats, or to friction  whilst they were being dragged upwards. But  [page 91]  if this is so, we must admit from the cases just given, that a tendency in  the upper part of the several specified organs to bend downwards and thus  to become arched, has now become with many plants firmly inherited. The  arching, to whatever cause it may be due, is the result of modified  circumnutation, through increased growth along the convex side of the part;  such growth being only temporary, for the part always straightens itself  subsequently by increased growth along the concave side, as will hereafter  be described.    It is a curious fact that the hypocotyls of some plants, which are but  little developed and which never raise their cotyledons above the ground,  nevertheless inherit a slight tendency to arch themselves, although this  movement is not of the least use to them. We refer to a movement observed  by Sachs in the hypocotyls of the bean and some other Leguminosae, and  which is shown in the accompanying figure (Fig. 59), copied from his  Essay.* The hypocotyl and radicle at first grow perpendicularly downwards,  as at A, and then bend, often in the course of 24 hours, into the position  shown at B. As we shall hereafter often have to recur to this movement, we  will, for brevity sake, call it \"Sachs' curvature.\" At first sight it might  be thought that the altered position of the radicle in B was wholly due to  the outgrowth of the epicotyl (e), the petiole (p) serving as a hinge; and  it is probable that this is partly the cause; but the hypocotyl and upper  part of the radicle themselves become slightly curved.    The above movement in the bean was repeatedly seen by us; but our  observations were made chiefly on Phaseolus multiflorus, the cotyledons of  which are like-    * 'Arbeiten des bot. Instit. Würzburg,' vol. i. 1873, p. 403.  [page 92]    wise hypogean. Some seedlings with well-developed radicles were first  immersed in a solution of permanganate of potassium; and, judging from the  changes of colour (though these were not very clearly defined), the  hypocotyl is about .3 inch in length. Straight, thin, black lines of this  length were now drawn from the bases of the short petioles along the  hypocotyls    Fig. 59. Vicia faba: germinating seeds, suspended in damp air: A, with  radicle growing perpendicularly downwards; B, the same bean after 24 hours  and after the radicle has curved itself; r. radicle; h, short hypocotyl; e,  epicotyl appearing as a knob in A and as an arch in B; p, petiole of the  cotyledon, the latter enclosed within the seed-coats.    of 23 germinating seeds, which were pinned to the lids of jars, generally  with the hilum downwards, and with their radicles pointing to the centre of  the earth. After an interval of from 24 to 48 hours the black lines on the  hypocotyls of 16 out of the 23 seedlings became distinctly curved, but in  very various degrees (namely, with radii between 20 and  [page 93]  80 mm. on Sachs' cyclometer) in the same relative direction as shown at B  in Fig. 59. As geotropism will obviously tend to check this curvature,  seven seeds were allowed to germinate with proper precautions for their  growth in a klinostat,* by which means geotropism was eliminated. The  position of the hypocotyls was observed during four successive days, and  they continued to bend towards the hilum and lower surface of the seed. On  the fourth day they were deflected by an average angle of 63o from a line  perpendicular to the lower surface, and were therefore considerably more  curved than the hypocotyl and radicle in the bean at B (Fig. 59), though in  the same relative direction.    It will, we presume, be admitted that all leguminous plants with hypogean  cotyledons are descended from forms which once raised their cotyledons  above the ground in the ordinary manner; and in doing so, it is certain  that their hypocotyls would have been abruptly arched, as in the case of  every other dicotyledonous plant. This is especially clear in the case of  Phaseolus, for out of five species, the seedlings of which we observed,  namely, P. multiflorus, caracalla, vulgaris, Hernandesii and Roxburghii  (inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds), the three last-named species have  well-developed hypocotyls which break through the ground as arches. Now, if  we imagine a seedling of the common bean or of P. multiflorus, to behave as  its progenitors once did, the hypocotyl (h, Fig. 59), in whatever position  the seed may have been buried, would become so much arched that the upper  part would be doubled down parallel to the lower part; and    * An instrument devised by Sachs, consisting essentially of a slowly  revolving horizontal axis, on which the plant under observation is  supported: see 'Würzburg Arbeiten,' 1879, p. 209.  [page 94]    this is exactly the kind of curvature which actually occurs in these two  plants, though to a much less degree. Therefore we can hardly doubt that  their short hypocotyls have retained by inheritance a tendency to curve  themselves in the same manner as they did at a former period, when this  movement was highly important to them for breaking through the ground,  though now rendered useless by the cotyledons being hypogean. Rudimentary  structures are in most cases highly variable, and we might expect that  rudimentary or obsolete actions would be equally so; and Sachs' curvature  varies extremely in amount, and sometimes altogether fails. This is the  sole instance known to us of the inheritance, though in a feeble degree, of  movements which have become superfluous from changes which the species has  undergone.    Rudimentary Cotyledons.--A few remarks on this subject may be here  interpolated. It is well known that some dicotyledonous plants produce only  a single cotyledon; for instance, certain species of Ranunculus, Corydalis,  Chaerophyllum; and we will here endeavour to show that the loss of one or  both cotyledons is apparently due to a store of nutriment being laid up in  some other part, as in the hypocotyl or one of the two cotyledons, or one  of the secondary radicles.    Fig. 60. Citrus aurantium: two young seedlings: c, larger cotyledon; c',  smaller cotyledon; h, thickened hypocotyl; r, radicle. In A the epicotyl is  still arched, in B it has become erect.  [page 95]    With the orange (Citrus aurantium) the cotyledons are hypogean, and one is  larger than the other, as may be seen in A (Fig. 60). In B the inequality  is rather greater, and the stem has grown between the points of insertion  of the two petioles, so that they do not stand opposite to one another; in  another case the separation amounted to one-fifth of an inch. The smaller  cotyledon of one seedling was extremely thin, and not half the length of  the larger one, so that it was clearly becoming rudimentary,* In all these  seedlings the hypocotyl was enlarged or swollen.

Polly read on and on, from one thing to another, not daring to look up  to see the effect, until at last everything in the way of gossip was  exhausted.    \"Is that all?\" asked Mrs. Chatterton hungrily.    Polly, hunting the columns for anything, even a murder account if it  was but in high life, turned the paper again disconsolately, obliged to  confess it was.    \"Well, do put it by, then,\" said Mrs. Chatterton sharply, \"and not  whirl it before my face; it gives me a frightful headache.\"    \"I might get the Town Talk\" suggested Polly, as a bright thought struck  her. \"It came yesterday. I saw it on the library table.\"    \"So it is Saturday.\" Mrs. Chatterton looked up quickly. \"Yes, you may,  Polly,\" her mouth watering for the revel she would have in its contents.    So Polly ran over the stairs with delighted feet, and into the library,  beginning to rummage over the papers and magazines on the reading table.    \"Where is it?\" she exclaimed, turning them with quick fingers. \"O dear!  it was right here last evening.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Phronsie, from the depths of a big arm-chair, and  looking up from her book. Then she saw as soon as she had asked the  question that Polly was in trouble, so she laid down her book, and slid  out of the chair. \"What is it, Polly? Let me help you, do.\"    \"Why, the Town Talk--that hateful old society thing,\" said Polly,  throwing the papers to right and left. \"You know, Phronsie; it has a  picture of a bottle of ink, and a big quill for a heading. O dear! do  help me, child, for she will get nervous if I am gone long.\"    \"Oh! I know where that is,\" said Phronsie deliberately, laying a cool  little hand on Polly's hot one.    \"Where?\" demanded Polly feverishly. \"Oh, Phronsie! where?\"    \"Jack Rutherford has it.\"    Polly threw down the papers, and started for the door.    \"He has gone,\" said Phronsie; \"he went home almost an hour ago.\"    Polly turned sharply at her. \"What did he want Town Talk for?\"    \"He said it was big, and he asked Grandpapa if he might have it, and  Grandpapa said, Yes. I don't know what he wanted it for,\" said  Phronsie. \"And he took other newspapers, too, Polly; oh! ever so many.\"    \"Well, I don't care how many he took, nor what they were,\" cried Polly,  \"only that very identical one. O dear me! Well, I'll ask Jasper.\"    And rushing from the library, Phronsie following in a small panic over  Polly's distress, she knocked at the door of Jasper's den, a little  room in the wing, looking out on the east lawn.    \"Oh! I am so glad you are here,\" she exclaimed as \"Come in!\" greeted  her, and both Phronsie and she precipitated themselves with no show of  ceremony, in front of his study table. \"O Jasper! could you get me a  copy of \"Town Talk?\" Jack Rutherford has gone off with ours.\"    \"Town Talk!\" repeated Jasper, raising his head from his hands to stare  at her.    \"Yes; Jack has taken ours off; Grandpapa gave it to him. Can you,  Jasper? Will it break up your study much?\" she poured out anxiously.    \"No--that is--never mind,\" said Jasper, pushing the book away and  springing from his chair. \"But whatever in the world do you want that  trash for?\" He turned, and looked at her curiously.    \"Mrs. Chatterton will let me read it to her; she said so,\" cried Polly,  clasping her hands nervously, \"but if I don't get the paper soon, why,  I'm afraid she'll change her mind.\"    Jasper gave a low whistle as he flung himself into his coat.  \"Inestimable privilege!\" he exclaimed at last, tossing on his cap.    \"Oh, Jasper! you are so good,\" cried Polly in a small rapture. \"I'm so  sorry to have to ask you.\"    \"I'll go for you, Jasper,\" declared Phronsie; \"Mamsie will let me; I  almost know she will.\"    \"No, no, Phronsie,\" said Jasper, as she was flying off; \"it isn't any  place for you to go to. I shall get one at the hotel--the Allibone.  I'll be back in a trice, Polly.\"    Polly went out, and sat down in one of the big oaken chairs in the hall  to seize it as it came, and Phronsie deposited herself in an opposite  chair, and watched Polly. And presently in came Jasper, waving the  desired journal. Polly, with a beaming face, grasped it and rushed off  upstairs.    \"Polly,\" called the boy, looking after her, \"it isn't too late now for  you to go with them. Lucy Bennett met me at the corner and she said  they will take the twelve o'clock train, instead of the eleven, and she  wanted me to beg you to come.\"    \"No, no,\" tossed back Polly, rushing on, \"I am quite determined to stay  at home.\" Then she went into Mrs. Chatterton's room, and closed the  door. But she couldn't so easily shut out the longings that would rise  in her heart for the Saturday outing that the other girls were to have.  How lovely it would be! the run out to Silvia Horne's charming house  some ten miles distant; the elegant luncheon they would have, followed  by games, and a dance in the ball-room upstairs, that Silvia's older  sisters used for their beautiful parties. Then the merry return before  dusk, of the twelve girls, all capital friends at school! Oh--oh!    \"You've been an unconscionable time,\" exclaimed Mrs. Chatterton in a  sharp, high key, \"just to get a paper. Well, do sit down; I am quite  tired waiting for you.\"    Polly sat down, and resolutely plunged into the column where the news  items promised the most plentiful yield but in between the lines ran  the doings of the girls: how they were all assembling by this time at  Lucy Bennett's; how they were hurrying off to the train, and all the  other delightful movements of the \"outing\" flashed before her eyes, as  she finished item after item of her dreary task. But how Mrs.  Chatterton gloated over it!    At last Polly, feeling as if she could not endure another five minutes  of it, glanced up to see the old lady's eyes actually sparkling; her  mouth had fallen into contented curves, and the jeweled hand resting on  the chair-arm was playing with the fringe, while she leaned forward  that she might not lose a word.    \"Read that again, Polly,\" she said, \"the list of presents exhibited at  Arabella Granger's wedding. I didn't hear any mention of the  Archibalds. It can't be that they have fallen out; and read more  slowly.\"    So Polly began once more the long lists of gifts that ushered in the  matrimonial happiness of Mrs. John Westover nee Miss Arabella Granger;  this time, however, stimulated by the pleasure she was giving, to find  it an endurable task.    It seemed to Polly as if Mrs. John Westover had everything on earth  given to her that could possibly be presented at a wedding;  nevertheless the list was gone through again bravely, Polly retracing  her steps two or three times to read the items over for her listener's  slow digestion.    \"The Archibalds are not mentioned, either as being there or sending a  gift, nor the Harlands, nor the Smythes, so I am very glad I didn't  remember her,\" said Mrs. Chatterton, drawing herself up with a relieved  sigh. \"Those presents sound fine on paper, but it isn't as well as she  might have done if she had made a different match. Now something else,  Polly,\" and she dismissed Mrs. Westover with a careless wave of her  hand. Polly flew off into the fashion hints, and was immediately lost  in the whirl of coming toilets. No one noticed when the door opened, so  of course no one saw Mrs. Whitney standing smiling behind the old  lady's big chair.    \"Well, Polly,\" said a pleasant voice suddenly.    Down went Town Talk to the floor as Polly sprang up with a glad cry,  and Mrs. Chatterton turned around nervously.    \"Oh, Auntie--Auntie!\" cried Polly, convulsively clinging to her, \"are  you really here, and is Dicky home?\"    \"Dear child,\" said Mrs. Whitney, as much a girl for the moment as Polly  herself. And pressing kisses on the red lips, while she folded her  close--\"Yes, Dick is at home. There, go and find him; he is in Mrs.  Pepper's room.\"    \"I am glad to see you so much better, Mrs. Chatterton,\" said Mrs.  Whitney, leaning over the invalid's chair to lay the tenderest of palms  on the hand resting on the chair-arm.    \"Oh, yes, Marian; I am better,\" said Mrs. Chatterton, looking around  for Polly, then down at the delicious Town Talk carelessly thrown on  the floor. \"Will you send her back as soon as possible?\" she asked with  her old imperativeness.    \"Who--Polly?\" said Mrs. Whitney, following the glance. \"Why, she has  gone to see Dick, you know. Now, why cannot I read a bit?\" and she  picked up the paper.    \"You don't know what has been read,\" said Mrs. Chatterton as Mrs.  Whitney drew up a chair and sat down, running her eye in a practiced  way over the front page. \"Dear me, it makes me quite nervous, Marian,  to see you prowling around all over the sheet that way.\"    \"Oh! I shall find something interesting quite soon, I fancy,\" said Mrs.  Whitney cheerfully, her heart on her boy and the jolly home-coming he  was having. \"Here is the Washington news; I mean all about the  receptions and teas.\"    \"She has read that,\" said Mrs. Chatterton.    \"Now for the fashion department.\" Mrs. Whitney whirled the paper over  dexterously. \"Do you know, Mrs. Chatterton, gray stuffs are to be worn  more than ever this spring?\"    \"I don't care about that,\" said Mrs. Chatterton quickly, \"and besides,  quite likely there'll be a complete revolution before spring really  sets in, and gray stuffs will go out. Find some description of tea  gowns, can't you? I must have one or two more.\"    \"And here are some wonderfully pretty caps, if they are all like the  descriptions,\" said Mrs. Whitney, unluckily dropping on another  paragraph.    \"Caps! who wants to hear about them?\" cried Mrs. Chatterton in a  dudgeon. \"I hope I'm not at the cap period yet.\"    \"Oh! those lovely little lace arrangements,\" said Mrs. Whitney hastily;  \"don't you know how exquisite they are at Pinaud's?\" she cried.    \"I'm sure I"]]]
