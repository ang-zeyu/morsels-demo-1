They  were watchful, and mighty quick on the draw.\"    \"That could be it. That's about as thin and as specious an explanation  as I ever saw cooked up, but it _does_ cover the facts ... and the two  of us will be able to make it stick ... but take notice, pretty boy,  that certain parties are not going to like this at all. In fact, they  are going to be very highly put out.\"    \"That's a nice hunk of understatement, boss. But notice one beautiful  thing about this story?\" Herkimer grinned maliciously. \"It lets us pass  the buck to Big Jim Towne. We can be--and will be--sore as hell because  he picks such weak-sister characters to do his killings!\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the heavily armored improvised ambulance, Virgil Samms sat up and  directed a thought at his friend Kinnison, finding his mind a turmoil  of confusion.    \"What's the matter, Rod?\"    \"Plenty!\" the big Lensman snapped back. \"They were--maybe still  are--too damn far ahead of us. Something has been going on that we  haven't even suspected. I stood by, as innocent as a three-year-old  girl baby, and let you walk right into that one--and I emphatically  do not enjoy getting caught with my pants down that way. It makes me  jumpy. This may be all, but it may not be--not by eleven thousand  light-years--and I'm trying to dope out what is going to happen next.\"    \"And what have you deduced?\"    \"Nothing. I'm stuck. So I'm tossing it into your lap. Besides, that's  what you are getting paid for, thinking. So go ahead and think. What  would you be doing, if you were on the other side?\"    \"I see. You think, then, that it might not be good technique to take  the time to go back to the spaceport?\"    \"You get the idea. But--can you stand transfer?\"    \"Certainly. They got my shoulder dressed and taped, and my arm in a  sling. Shock practically all gone. Some pain, but not much. I can walk  without falling down.\"    \"Fair enough. Clayton!\" He Lensed a vigorous thought. \"Have any of the  observers spotted anything, high up or far off?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Good. Kinnison to Commodore Clayton, orders. Have a 'copter come down  and pick up Samms and myself on tractors. Instruct the _Boise_ and  the cruisers to maintain utmost vigilance. Instruct the _Chicago_ to  pick us up. Detach the _Chicago_ and the _Boise_ from your task force.  Assign them to me. Off.\"    \"Clayton to Commissioner Kinnison. Orders received and are being  carried out. Off.\"    The transfers were made without incident. The two super-dreadnaughts  leaped into the high stratosphere and tore westward. Half-way to the  Hill, Kinnison called Dr. Frederick Rodebush.    \"Fred? Kinnison. Have Cleve and Bergenholm link up with us. Now--how  are the Geigers on the outside of the Hill behaving?\"    \"Normal, all of them,\" the physicist-Lensman reported after a moment.  \"Why?\"    Kinnison detailed the happenings of the recent past. \"So tell the boys  to unlimber all the stuff the Hill has got.\"    \"My God!\" Cleveland exclaimed. \"Why, that's putting us back to the days  of the Interplanetary Wars!\"    \"With one notable exception,\" Kinnison pointed out. \"The attack, if  any, will be strictly modern. I hope we'll be able to handle it. One  good thing, the old mountain's got a lot of sheer mass. How much  radioactivity will it stand?\"    \"Allotropic iron, U-235, or plutonium?\" Rodebush seized his slide-rule.    \"What difference does it make?\"    \"From a practical standpoint ... perhaps none. But with a task force  defending, not many bombs could get through, so I'd say ...\"    \"I wasn't thinking so much of bombs.\"    \"What, then?\"    \"Isotopes. A good, thick blanket of dust. Slow-speed, fine stuff that  neither our ships nor the Hill's screens could handle. We've got to  decide, first, whether Virgil will be safer there in the Hill or out in  space in the _Chicago_; and second, for how long.\"    \"I see ... I'd say here, _under_ the Hill. Months, perhaps years,  before anything could work down this far. And we can _always_ get out.  No matter how hot the surface gets, we've got enough screen, heavy  water, cadmium, lead, mercury, and everything else necessary to get him  out through the locks.\"    \"That's what I was hoping you'd say. And now, about the defense ...  I wonder ... I don't want everybody to think I've gone completely  hysterical, but I'll be damned if I want to get caught again with....\"  His thought faded out.    \"May I offer a suggestion, sir?\" Bergenholm's thought broke the  prolonged silence.    \"I'd be very glad to have it--your suggestions so far haven't been idle  vaporings. Another hunch?\"    \"No, sir, a logical procedure. It has been some months since the last  emergency call-out drill was held. If you issue such another call now,  and nothing happens, it can be simply another surprise drill; with  credit, promotion, and monetary awards for the best performances;  further practice and instruction for the less proficient units.\"    \"Splendid, Dr. Bergenholm!\" Samms' brilliant and agile mind snatched  up the thought and carried it along. \"And what a chance, Rod, for  something vastly larger and more important than a Continental, or even  a Tellurian, drill--make it the first maneuver of the Galactic Patrol!\"    \"I'd like to, Virge, but we can't. My boys are ready, but you aren't.  No top appointments and no authority.\"    \"That can be arranged in a very few minutes. We have been waiting for  the psychological moment. This, especially if trouble should develop,  is the time. You yourself expect an attack, do you not?\"    \"Yes. I would not start anything unless and until I was ready to finish  it, and I see no reason for assuming that whoever it was that tried to  kill you is not at least as good a planner as I am.\"    \"And the rest of you...? Dr. Bergenholm?\"    \"My reasoning, while it does not exactly parallel that of Commissioner  Kinnison, leads to the same conclusion; that an attack in great force  is to be expected.\"    \"Not _exactly_ parallel?\" Kinnison demanded. \"In what respects?\"    \"You do not seem to have considered the possibility, Commissioner, that  the proposed assassination of First Lensman Samms could very well have  been only the first step in a comprehensive operation.\"    \"I didn't ... and it _could_ have been. So go ahead, Virge, with....\"    The thought was never finished, for Samms had already gone ahead.  Simultaneously, it seemed, the minds of eight other Lensmen joined  the group of Tellurians. Samms, intensely serious, spoke aloud to his  friend:    \"The Galactic Council is now assembled. Do you, Roderick K. Kinnison,  promise to uphold, in as much as you conscientiously can and with all  that in you lies, the authority of this Council throughout all space?\"    \"I promise.\"    \"By virtue of the authority vested in me its president by the Galactic  Council, I appoint you Port Admiral of the Galactic Patrol. My fellow  councillors are now inducting the armed forces of their various solar  systems into the Galactic Patrol ... It will not take long ... There,  you may make your appointments and issue orders for the mobilization.\"    The two super-dreadnaughts were now approaching the Hill. The _Boise_  stayed \"up on top\"; the _Chicago_ went down. Kinnison, however, paid  very little attention to the landing or to Samms' disembarkation, and  none whatever to the _Chicago's_ reascent into the high heavens. He  knew that everything was under control; and, now alone in his cabin, he  was busy.    \"All personnel of all armed forces just inducted into the Galactic  Patrol, attention!\" He spoke into an ultra-wave microphone, the  familiar parade-ground rasp very evident in his deep and resonant  voice. \"Kinnison of Tellus, Port Admiral, speaking. Each of you has  taken oath to the Galactic Patrol?\"    They had.    \"At ease. The organization chart already in your hands is made  effective as of now. Enter in your logs the date and time. Promotions:  Commodore Clayton of North America, Tellus....\"    In his office at New York Spaceport Clayton came to attention and  saluted crisply; his eyes shining, his deeply-scarred face alight.    \"... to be Admiral of the First Galactic Region. Commodore Schweikert  of Europe, Tellus ...\"    In Berlin a narrow-waisted, almost foppish-seeming man, with roached  blond hair and blue eyes, bowed stiffly from the waist and saluted  punctiliously.    \"... to be Lieutenant-Admiral of the First Galactic Region.\"    And so on, down the list. A marshal and a lieutenant-marshal of the  Solarian System; a general and a lieutenant-general of the planet Sol  Three. Promotions, agreed upon long since, to fill the high offices  thus vacated. Then the list of commodores upon other planets--Guindlos  of Redland, Mars; Sesseffsen of Talleron, Venus; Raymond of the Jovian  Sub-System; Newman of Alphacent; Walters of Sirius; van-Meeter of  Valeria; Adams of Procyon; Roberts of Altair; Barrtell of Fomalhout;  Armand of Vega; and Coigne of Aldebaran--each of whom was actually the  commander-in-chief of the armed forces of a world. Each of these was  made general of his planet.    \"Except for lieutenant-commodores and up, who will tune their minds to  me--dismissed!\" Kinnison stopped talking and went onto his Lens.    \"That was for the record. I don't need to tell you, fellows, how glad  I am to be able to do this. You're tops, all of you--I don't know of  anybody I'd rather have at my back when the ether gets rough ...\"    \"Right back at you, chief!\" \"Same to you Rod!\" \"Rocky Rod, Port  Admiral!\" \"Now we're blasting!\" came a melange of thoughts. Those  splendid men, with whom he had shared so much of danger and of stress,  were all as jubilant as schoolboys.    \"But the thing that makes this possible may also make it necessary  for us to go to work; to earn your extra stars and my wheel.\"  Kinnison smothered the welter of thoughts and outlined the situation,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#19)"],[1,"be noticed in the next chapter. Bacteria are  agents of decomposition, and they are just as likely to decompose  material which the farmer wishes to preserve as they are to  decompose material which the farmer desires to undergo the process  of decay. They are as ready to attack his fruits and vegetables as  to ripen his cream. The skin of fruits and vegetables is a  moderately good protection of the interior from the attack of  bacteria; but if the skin be broken in any place, bacteria get in  and cause decay, and to prevent it the farmer uses a cold cellar.  The bacteria prevent the farmer from preserving meats for any  length of time unless he checks their growth in some way. They get  into the eggs of his fowls and ruin them. Their troublesome nature  in the dairy in preventing the keeping of milk has already been  noticed. If he plants his seeds in very moist, damp weather, the  soil bacteria cause too rapid a decomposition of the seeds and  they rot in the ground instead of sprouting. They produce  disagreeable odours, and are the cause of most of the peculiar  smells, good and bad, around the barn. They attack the organic  matter which gets into his well or brook or pond, decomposing it,  filling the water with disagreeable and perhaps poisonous products  which render it unfit to drink. They not only aid in the decay of  the fallen tree in his forests; but in the same way attack the  timber which he wishes to preserve, especially if it is kept in a  moist condition. Thus they contribute largely to the gradual  destruction of wooden structures. It is therefore the presence of  these organisms which forces him to dry his hay, to smoke his  hams, to corn his beef, to keep his fruits and vegetables cool and  prevent skin bruises, to ice his dairy, to protect his timber from  rain, to use stone instead of wooden foundations for buildings,  etc. In general, when the farmer desires to get rid of any organic  refuse, he depends upon bacteria, for they are his sole agents  (aside from fire) for the final destruction of organic matter.  When he wishes to convert waste organic refuse into fertilizing  material, he uses the bacteria of his compost heap. On the other  hand, whenever he desires to preserve organic material, the  bacteria are the enemies against which he must carefully guard.    Thus the farmer's life from year's end to year's end is in most  intimate association with bacteria. Upon them he depends to insure  the continued fertility of his soil and the constant continued  production of good crops. Upon them he depends to turn into plant  food all the organic refuse from his house or from his barn. Upon  them he depends to replenish his stock of nitrogen. It is these  organisms which furnish his dairy with its butter flavours and  with the taste of its cheese. But, on the other hand, against them  he must be constantly alert. All his food products must be  protected from their ravages. A successful farmer's life, then,  largely resolves itself into a skilful management of bacterial  activity. To aid them in destroying or decomposing everything  which he does not desire to preserve, and to prevent their  destroying the organic material which he wishes to keep for future  use, is the object of a considerable portion of farm labour; and  the most successful farmer to-day, and we believe the most  successful farmer of the future, is the one who most intelligently  and skilfully manipulates these gigantic forces furnished him by  the growth of his microscopical allies.    RELATION OF BACTERIA TO COAL. Another one of Nature's processes in  which bacteria have played an important part is in the formation  of coal. It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of coal in  modern civilization. Aside from its use as fuel, upon which  civilization is dependent, coal is a source of an endless variety  of valuable products. It is the source of our illuminating gas,  and ammonia is one of the products of the gas manufacture. From  the coal also comes coal tar, the material from which such a long  series of valuable materials, as aniline colours, carbolic acid,  etc, is derived. The list of products which we owe to coal is very  long, and the value of this material is hardly to be overrated. In  the preparation of these ingredients from coal bacteria do not  play any part. Most of them are derived by means of distillation.  But when asked for the agents which have given us the coal of the  coal beds, we shall find that here, too, we owe a great debt to  bacteria.    Coal, as is well known, has come from the accumulation of the  luxuriant vegetable growth of the past geological ages. It has  therefore been directly furnished us by the vegetation of the  green plants of the past, and, in general, it represents so much  carbonic dioxide which these plants have extracted from the  atmosphere. But while the green plants have been the active agents  in producing this assimilation, bacteria have played an important  part in coal manufacture in two different directions. The first  appears to be in furnishing these plants with nitrogen. Without a  store of fixed nitrogen in the soil these carboniferous plants  could not have grown. This matter has already been considered. We  have no very absolute knowledge as to the agency of bacteria in  furnishing nitrogen for this vegetation in past ages, but there is  every reason to believe that in the past, as in the present, the  chief source of organic nitrogen has been from the atmosphere and  derived from the atmosphere through the agency of bacteria. In the  absence of any other known factor we may be pretty safe in the  assumption that bacteria played an important part in this nitrogen  fixation, and that bacteria must therefore be regarded as the  agents which have furnished us the nitrogen stored in the coal.    But in a later stage of coal formation bacteria have contributed  more directly to the formation of coal. Coal is not simply  accumulated vegetation. The coal of our coal beds is very  different in its chemical composition from the wood of the trees.  It contains a much higher percentage of carbon and a lower  percentage of hydrogen and oxygen than ordinary vegetable  substances. The conversion of the vegetation of the carboniferous  ages into coal was accompanied by a gradual loss of hydrogen and a  consequent increase in the percentage of carbon. It is this change  that has added to the density of the substance and makes the  greater value of coal as fuel. There is little doubt now as to the  method by which this woody material of the past has been converted  into coal. The same process appears to be going on in a similar  manner to-day in the peat beds of various northern countries. The  fallen vegetation, trees, trunks, branches, and leaves, accumulate  in masses, and, when the conditions of moisture and temperature  are right, begin to undergo a fermentation. Ordinarily this action  of bacteria, as already noticed, produces an almost complete  though slow oxidation of the carbon, and results in the total  decay of the vegetable matter. But if the vegetable mass be  covered by water and mud under proper conditions of moisture and  temperature, a different kind of fermentation arises which does  not produce such complete decay. The covering of water prevents  the access of oxygen to the fermenting mass, an oxidation of the  carbon is largely prevented, and the vegetable matter slowly  changes its character. Under the influence of this slow  fermentation, aided, probably by pressure, the mass becomes more  and more solid and condensed, its woody character becomes less and  less distinct, and there is a gradual loss of the hydrogen and the  oxygen. Doubtless there is a loss of carbon also, for there is an  evolution of marsh gas which contains carbon. But, in this slow  fermentation taking place under the water in peat bogs and marshes  the carbon loss is relatively small; the woody material does not  become completely oxidized, as it does in free operations of  decay. The loss of hydrogen and oxygen from the mass is greater  than that of carbon, and the percentage of carbon therefore  increases. This is not the ordinary kind of fermentation that goes  on in vegetable accumulations. It requires special conditions and  possibly special kinds of fermenting organisms. Peat is not formed  in all climates. In warm regions, or where the woody matter is  freely exposed to the air, the fermentation of vegetable matter is  more complete, and it is entirely destroyed by oxidation. It is  only in colder regions and when covered with water that the  destruction of the organic matter stops short of decay. But such  incomplete fermentation is still going on in many parts of the  world, and by its means vegetable accumulations are being  converted into peat.    This formation of peat appears to be a first step in the formation  of denser coal. By a continuation of the same processes the mass  becomes still more dense and solid. As we pass from the top to the  bottom of such an accumulation of peat, we find it becoming denser  and denser, and at the bottom it is commonly of a hard consistence,  brownish in colour, and with only slight traces of the  original woody structure. Such material is called lignite. It  contains a higher percentage of carbon than peat, but a lower  percentage than coal, and is plainly a step in coal formation. But  the process goes on, the hydrogen and oxygen loss continuing until  there is finally produced true coal.    If this is the correct understanding of the formation of coal, we  see that we have plainly a process in which bacterial life has had  a large and important share. We are, of course, densely ignorant  of the exact processes going on. We know nothing positively as to  the kind of microorganisms which produce this slow, peculiar  fermentation. As yet, the fermentation going on in the formation  of the peat has not been studied by the"]]]
