THE FIRST LIBERAL CHURCH    In 1770 the brig Hand-in-Hand went ashore at Good Luck, New Jersey. Among  the passengers on board the vessel, that it would perhaps be wrong to  call ill fated, was John Murray, founder of Universalism in America. He  had left England in despair, for his wife and children were dead, and so  broken was he in his power of thought and purpose that he felt as if he  should never preach again.    In fact, his rescue from the wreck was passive, on his part, and he  suffered himself to be carried ashore, recking little whether he reached  it or no. After he had been for half an hour or so on the soil of the new  country, to which he had made his entrance in so unexpected a manner, he  began to feel hungry, and set off afoot along the desolate beach. He came  to a cabin where an old man stood in a doorway with a basket of fish  beside him. \"Will you sell me a fish?\" asked Murray.    \"No. The fish is all yours. I expected you.\"    \"You do not know me.\"    \"You are the man who is to tell us of God.\"    \"I will never preach of Him again.\"    \"I built that log church yonder. Don't say that you will not preach in  it. Whenever a clergyman, Presbyterian, Methody, or Baptist, came here, I  asked him to preach in my kitchen. I tried to get him to stay; but no--he  always had work elsewhere. Last night I saw the brig driven on the bar,  and a voice said to me, 'In that ship is the man who will teach of God.  Not the old God of terrors, but one of love and mercy. He has come  through great sorrow to do this work.' I have made ready for you. Do not  go away.\"    The minister felt a strange lifting in his heart. He fell on his knees  before the little house and offered up a prayer. Long he staid in that  place, preaching gentle doctrines and ministering to the men and women of  that lonely village, and when the fisherman apostle, Thomas Potter, died  he left the church to Murray, who, in turn, bequeathed it, \"free, for the  use of all Christian people.\"          ON AND NEAR THE DELAWARE          THE PHANTOM DRAGOON    The height that rises a mile or so to the south of Newark, Delaware, is  called Iron Hill, because it is rich in hematite ore, but about the time  of General Howe's advance to the Brandywine it might well have won its  name because of the panoply of war--the sullen guns, the flashing swords,  and glistening bayonets--that appeared among the British tents pitched on  it. After the red-coats had established camp here the American outposts  were advanced and one of the pickets was stationed at Welsh Tract Church.  On his first tour of duty the sentry was thrown into great alarm by the  appearance of a figure robed from head to foot in white, that rode a  horse at a charging gait within ten feet of his face. When guard was  relieved the soldier begged that he might never be assigned to that post  again. His nerves were strong in the presence of an enemy in the  flesh--but an enemy out of the grave! Ugh! He would desert rather than  encounter that shape again. His request was granted. The sentry who  succeeded him was startled, in the small hours, by a rush of hoofs and  the flash of a pallid form. He fired at it, and thought that he heard the  sound of a mocking laugh come back.    Every night the phantom horseman made his rounds, and several times the  sentinels shot at him without effect, the white horse and white rider  showing no annoyance at these assaults. When it came the turn of a  sceptical and unimaginative old corporal to take the night detail, he  took the liberty of assuming the responsibilities of this post himself.  He looked well to the priming of his musket, and at midnight withdrew out  of the moonshine and waited, with his gun resting on a fence. It was not  long before the beat of hoofs was heard approaching, and in spite of  himself the corporal felt a thrill along his spine as a mounted figure  that might have represented Death on the pale horse came into view; but  he jammed his hat down, set his teeth, and sighted his flint-lock with  deliberation. The rider was near, when bang went the corporal's musket,  and a white form was lying in the road, a horse speeding into the  distance. Scrambling over the fence, the corporal, reassured, ran to the  form and turned it over: a British scout, quite dead. The daring fellow,  relying on the superstitious fears of the rustics in his front, had made  a nightly ride as a ghost, in order to keep the American outposts from  advancing, and also to guess, from elevated points, at the strength and  disposition of their troops. He wore a cuirass of steel, but that did not  protect his brain from the corporal's bullet.          DELAWARE WATER GAP    The Indian name of this beautiful region, Minisink, \"the water is gone,\"  agrees with the belief of geologists that a lake once existed behind the  Blue Ridge, and that it burst its way through the hills at this point.  Similar results were produced by a cataclysm on the Connecticut at Mount  Holyoke, on the Lehigh at Mauch Chunk, and Runaway Pond, New Hampshire,  got its name by a like performance. The aborigines, whatever may be said  against them, enjoyed natural beauty, and their habitations were often  made in this delightful region, their councils being attended by chief  Tamanend, or Tammany, a Delaware, whose wisdom and virtues were such as  to raise him to the place of patron saint of America. The notorious  Tammany Society of New York is named for him. When this chief became old  and feeble his tribe abandoned him in a hut at New Britain, Pennsylvania,  and there he tried to kill himself by stabbing, but failing in that, he  flung burning leaves over himself, and so perished. He was buried where  he died. It was a princess of his tribe that gave the name of Lover's  Leap to a cliff on Mount Tammany, by leaping from it to her death,  because her love for a young European was not reciprocated.    There is a silver-mine somewhere on the opposite mountain of Minsi, the  knowledge of its location having perished with the death of a recluse,  who coined the metal he took from it into valuable though illegal  dollars, going townward every winter to squander his earnings. During the  Revolution \"Oran the Hawk,\" a Tory and renegade, was vexatious to the  people of Delaware Valley, and a detachment of colonial troops was sent  in pursuit of him. They overtook him at the Gap and chased him up the  slopes of Tammany, though he checked their progress by rolling stones  among them. One rock struck a trooper, crushed him, and bore him down to  the base of a cliff, his blood smearing it in his descent. But though he  seemed to have eluded his pursuers, Oran was shot in several places  during his flight, and when at last he cast himself into a thicket, to  rest and get breath, it was never to rise again. His bones, cracked by  bullets and gnawed by beasts, were found there when the leaves fell.          THE PHANTOM DRUMMER    Colonel Howell, of the king's troops, was a gay fellow, framed to make  women false; but when he met the rosy, sweet-natured daughter of farmer  Jarrett, near Valley Forge, he attempted no dalliance, for he fell too  seriously in love. He might not venture into the old man's presence, for  Jarrett had a son with Washington, and he hated a red-coat as he did the  devil; but the young officer met the girl in secret, and they plighted  troth beneath the garden trees, hidden in gray mist. As Howell bent to  take his first kiss that night, a rising wind went past, bringing from  afar the roll of a drum, and as they talked the drum kept drawing nearer,  until it seemed at hand. The officer peered across the wall, then hurried  to his mistress' side, as pale as death. The fields outside were empty of  life.    Louder came the rattling drum; it seemed to enter the gate, pass but a  yard away, go through the wall, and die in the distance. When it ceased,  Howell started as if a spell had been lifted, laxed his grip on the  maiden's hand, then drew her to his breast convulsively. Ruth's terror  was more vague but no less genuine than his own, and some moments passed  before she could summon voice to ask him what this visitation meant. He  answered, \"Something is about to change my fortunes for good or ill;  probably for ill. Important events in my family for the past three  generations have been heralded by that drum, and those events were  disasters oftener than benefits.\" Few more words passed, and with another  kiss the soldier scaled the wall and galloped away, the triple beat of  his charger's hoofs sounding back into the maiden's ears like drum-taps.  In a skirmish next day Colonel Howell was shot. He was carried to farmer  Jarrett's house and left there, in spite of the old man's protest, for he  was willing to give no shelter to his country's enemies. When Ruth saw  her lover in this strait she was like to have fallen, but when she  learned that it would take but a few days of quiet and care to restore  him to health, she was ready to forgive her fellow-countrymen for  inflicting an injury that might result in happiness for both of them.    It took a great deal of teasing to overcome the scruples of the farmer,  but he gruffly consented to receive the young man until his hurt should  heal. Ruth attended him faithfully, and the cheerful, manly nature of the  officer so won the farmer's heart that he soon forgot the color of  Howell's coat. Nor was he surprised when Howell told him that he loved  his daughter and asked for her hand; indeed, it had been easy to guess  their affection, and the old man declared that but for his allegiance to  a tyrant he would gladly own him as a son-in-law. It was a long struggle  between love and duty that ensued in Howell's breast, and love was  victor. If he might marry Ruth he would leave the army. The old man gave  prompt consent, and a secret marriage was arranged."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#19)"],[1,"sake and with Heaven's help I will undertake this battle.\"    They then clothed him in the richest armour that the city could furnish,  with a good hauberk of steel, and a helmet whose gold circle sparkled  with precious stones, and on the top whereof stood a flower wrought of  divers colours in rare gems. Gloves of mail he wore, and greaves upon  his legs, and a shirt of ring-mail upon his body, with a quilted  gambeson beneath: sharp was the sword, and richly carved the heavy spear  he bare; his threefold shield was overlaid with gold. They led forth to  him a swift steed; but before he mounted he went down upon his knees and  meekly told his beads, praying God to succor him that day. And the two  kings held a parley for an hour, Anlaf promising on his part that if his  champion fell he would go back with all his host to Denmark and never  more make war on Britain, whilst Athelstan agreed, if his knight were  vanquished, to make Anlaf King of England, and henceforth to be his  vassal and pay tribute both of gold and silver money.    Then Colbrand stode forth to the battle. So great was he of stature that  no horse could bear him, nor indeed could any man make a cart wherein to  carry him. He was armed with black armour of so great weight that a  score of men could scarce bear up his hauberk only, and it took three to  carry his helmet. He bare a great dart within his hand, and slung around  his body were swords and battle-axes more than two hundred in number.    Sir Guy rode boldly at him, but his spear shivered into pieces against  the giant's armour. Then Colbrand threw three darts. The first two  passed wide, but the third crashed through Sir Guy's shield, and glided  betwixt his arm and side, nor fell to ground till it had sped over a  good acre of the field. Then a blow from the giant's sword just missed  the knight, but lighting on his saddle at the back of him hewed horse  and saddle clean in two; so Sir Guy was brought to ground. Yet lightly  sprang he to his feet, and though seemingly but a child beside the  monster man, he laid on hotly with his sword upon the giant's armour,  until the sword brake in his hands. Then Colbrand called on him to  yield, since he had no longer a weapon wherewith to fight. \"Nay,\"  answered Sir Guy, \"but I will have one are of thine,\" and with that ran  deftly to the giant's side and wrenched away a battle-axe wherewith he  maintained the combat. Right well Sir Guy endured while Colbrand's  mighty strokes shattered his armour all about him, until his shield  being broke in pieces it seemed he could no longer make defence, and the  Danes raised a great shout at their champion's triumph. Then Colbrand  aimed a last stroke at the knight to lay him low, but Sir Guy lightly  avoiding it, the giant's sword smote into the earth a foot or more, and  before he could withdraw it or free his hand, Sir Guy hewed off the arm  with his battle-axe; and since Colbrand's weight leaned on that arm, he  fell to the ground. So Sir Guy cut off his head, and triumphed over the  giant Colbrand, and the Danes withdrew to their own country.    Then without so much as telling who he was, Sir Guy doffed his armour  and put on his palmer's weeds again, and secretly withdrawing himself  from all the feasts and games they held in honour of him in the city of  Winchester, passed out alone and took his journey toward Warwick on  foot.    Many a year had gone since he had left his wife and home. The boy whom  Felice had borne him, named Raynburn, he had never seen; nor, as it  befell, did he ever see his son. For Raynburn in his childhood had been  stolen away by Saracens and carried to a far heathen country, where King  Aragus brought him up and made him first his page, then chamberlain, and  as he grew to manhood, knighted him. And now he fought the battles of  King Aragus with a strong arm like his father Guy's, neither could any  endure against his spear. But all these years Felice had passed in  prayer and charity, entertaining pilgrims and tired wayfarers, and  comforting the sick and the distressed. And it was so that Sir Guy, all  travel-worn and with his pilgrim's staff in hand, came to her house and  craved an alms. She took him in and washed his feet and ministered to  him, asking oftentimes if in his travels he had seen her lord Sir Guy.  But when he watched her gentleness to the poor and to the children at  her gate, he feared to break in upon her holy life, and so refrained  himself before her and would not reveal himself, but with a heavy heart  came out from the lady's door and gat him to a hermit's cell. There he  abode in fasting and in penitence many weeks, till feeling his end draw  near, he took the ring from his finger and sent it by a herdsman to  Felice. \"Where got you this token?\" cried Felice, all trembling with her  wonderment and fear. \"From a poor beggar-man that lives in yonder cell,\"  the herdsman answered. \"From a beggar? Nay, but from a kingly man,\" said  Felice, \"for he is my husband, Guy of Warwick!\" and gave the herdsman a  hundred marks. Then she hasted and came to Sir Guy in his hermit's cell,  and for a long space they wept in each other's arms and neither spake a  word.    Weaker and fainter waxed Sir Guy. In a little while he died, and Felice  closed his tired eyes. Fifteen weary days she lingered sore in grief,  and then God's angel came and closed her own.          CHAPTER VIII    CHEVY CHASE        God prosper long our noble king,      Our lives and safeties all;    A woeful hunting once there did      In Chevy Chase befall.      To drive the deer with hound and horn      Earl Percy took the way;    The child may rue that is unborn      The hunting of that day.      The stout earl of Northumberland      A vow to God did make,    His pleasure in the Scottish woods      Three summer days to take--      The chiefest harts in Chevy Chase      To kill and bear away.    These tidings to Earl Douglas came      In Scotland where he lay;      Who sent Earl Percy present word      He would prevent his sport.    The English earl not fearing that,      Did to the woods resort.    With fifteen hundred bowmen bold,      All chosen men of might,    Who knew full well in time of need      To aim their shafts aright.      The gallant greyhound swiftly ran      To chase the fallow deer;    On Monday they began to hunt      Ere daylight did appear;      And long before high noon they had      A hundred fat bucks slain;    Then having dined, the drovers went      To rouse the deer again.      The bowmen mustered on the hills,      Well able to endure;    Their backsides all with special care      That day were guarded sure.      The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,      The nimble deer to take,    That with their cries the hills and dales      An echo shrill did make.      Lord Percy to the quarry went      To view the tender deer;    Quoth he, \"Earl Douglas promised once      This day to meet me here.\"      \"But if I thought he would not come,      No longer would I stay\";    With that a brave young gentleman      Thus to the earl did say:      \"Lo, yonder doth Earl Douglas come,      His men in armour bright;    Full twenty hundred Scottish spears      All marching in our sight;      \"All men of pleasant Teviotdale,      Fast by the River Tweed.\"    \"O cease your sports,\" Earl Percy said,      \"And take your bows with speed;      \"And now with me, my countrymen,      Your courage forth advance,    For there was never champion yet,      In Scotland or in France,      \"That ever did on horseback come,      And if my hap it were,    I durst encounter man for man      With him to break a spear.\"      Earl Douglas on his milk white steed,      Most like a baron bold,    Rode foremost of his company,      Whose armour shone like gold.      \"Show me,\" said he, \"whose men you be,      That hunt so boldly here,    That, without my consent, do chase      And kill my fallow deer.\"      The first man that did answer make,      Was noble Percy he,    Who said, \"We list not to declare      Nor show whose men we be:      \"Yet will we spend our dearest blood      Thy chiefest harts to slay.\"    Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,      And thus in rage did say:      \"Ere thus I will out-braved be,      One of us two shall die;    I know thee well, an earl thou art--      Lord Percy, so am I.      \"But trust me, Percy, pity it were,      And great offence, to kill    Any of these our guiltless men,      For they have done none ill.      \"Let thou and I the battle try,      And set our men aside.\"    \"Accurst be he,\" Earl Percy said,      \"By whom it is denied.\"      Then stept a gallant squire forth--      Witherington was his name--    Who said, \"I would not have it told      To Henry, our king, for shame,      \"That e'er my captain fought on foot,      And I stood looking on.    You be two earls,\" quoth Witherington,      \"And I a squire alone;      \"I'll do the best that do I may,      While I have power to stand;    While I have power to wield my sword,      I'll fight with heart and hand.\"      Our English archers bent their bows--      Their hearts were good and true;    At the first flight of arrows sent,      Full four score Scots they slew.      To drive the deer with hound and horn,      Douglas bade on the bent,    Two captains moved with mickle might,      Their spears to shivers went.      They closed full fast on every side,      No slackness there was found,    But many a gallant gentleman      Lay gasping on the ground.      O Christ! it was great grief to see      How each man chose his spear,    And how the blood out of their breasts      Did gush like water clear.      At last these two stout earls did meet      Like captains of great might;    Like lions wode, they laid on lode;      They made a cruel fight.      They fought until they both did sweat,      With swords of tempered steel,    Till blood down their cheeks like rain      They trickling down did feel.      \"O"]]]
