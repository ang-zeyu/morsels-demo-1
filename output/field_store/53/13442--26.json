Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive                                  Foundation      Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread  public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the  number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed  in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment  including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are  particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable  effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these  requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not  received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or  determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit  http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have  not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against  accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us  with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any  statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the  United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods  and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including  checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please  visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate      Section 5.            General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.      Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm  concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with  anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm  eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,  all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright  notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance  with any particular paper edition.    Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks eBook  number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed  (zipped), HTML and others.    Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the  old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.  _Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving  new filenames and etext numbers.
