The headless and handless hulk of the giant Antigonus  lies sprawling, while on his body rests Antwerp castle. Standing over  all, at the top, is Brabo high in air. He holds one of the hands of  Antigonus, which he is about to toss into the Scheldt River.    No people honor valor more than the Belgians. Themselves are to-day, as  of old, among the bravest.          THE FARM THAT RAN AWAY AND CAME BACK      There was once a Dutchman, who lived in the province called Drenthe.  Because there was a row of little trees on his farm, his name was Ryer  Van Boompjes; that is, Ryer of the Little Trees. After a while, he moved  to the shore of the Zuyder Zee and into Overijssel. Overijssel means  over the Ijssel River. There he bought a new farm, near the village of  Blokzyl. By dyking and pumping, certain wise men had changed ten acres,  of sand and heath, into pasture and land for plowing. They surrounded it  on three sides with canals. The fourth side fronted on the Zuyder Zee.  Then they advertised, in glowing language, the merits of the new land  and Ryer Van Boompjes bought it and paid for his real estate. He was as  proud as a popinjay of his island and he ruled over it like a Czar or a  Kaiser.    A few years before, Ryer had married a \"queezel,\" as the Dutch call  either a nun, or a maid who is no longer young. At this date, when our  story begins, he had four blooming, but old-fashioned children, with  good appetites. They could eat cabbage and potatoes, rye bread and  cheese, by the half peck, and drink buttermilk by the quart. In  addition, Ryer owned four horses, six cows, two dogs, some roosters and  hens, a flock of geese, two dozen ducks, and a donkey.    Yet although Ryer was rich, as wealth is reckoned in Drenthe, whence he  had come, he was greedy for more. He skimped the food of his animals. So  much did he do this, that his neighbors declared that they had seen him  put green spectacles on his cows and the donkey. Then he mixed straws  and shavings with the hay to make the animals think they were eating  fresh grass.    When he ploughed, he drove his horses close to the edge next to the  water, so as to make use of every half inch of land. When sometimes bits  of fen land, from his neighbor's farms, got loose and floated on the  water, Ryer felt he was in luck. He would go out at night, grapple the  boggy stuff and fasten it to his own land.    After this had happened several times, and Ryer had added a half acre to  his holdings, his greed possessed him like a bad fairy. He began to  steal the land on the other side of the Zuyder Zee. In the course of  time, he became a regular land thief. Whenever he saw, or heard of, a  floating bit of territory, he rowed his boat after it by night. Before  morning, aided by wicked helpers, who shared in the plunder, and were in  his pay, he would have the bog attached to his own farm.    All this time, he hardly realized that his ill-gotten property, now  increased to twelve acres or more, was itself a very shaky bit of real  estate. In fact, it was not real at all. His wife one day told him so,  for she knew of her mean husband's trickery.    About this time, heavy rains fell, for many days, and without ceasing,  until all the region was reduced to pulp and the country seemed afloat.  The dykes appeared ready to burst. Thousands feared that the land had an  attack of the disease called val (fall) and that the soil would sink  under the waves as portions of the realm had done before, in days long  gone by.    Yet none of this impending trouble worried Ryer, whose greed grew by  what it fed upon. In fact, the first day the sun shone again, quickly  drying up parts of his farm, he had two horses harnessed up for work.  Then he drove them so near the edge of the ditch that plough, man, and  horses tumbled, and down they went, into the shiny mess of mud and  water.    At this moment, also, the water, from below the bottom of the Zuyder  Zee, welled up, in a great wave, like a mushroom, and the whole of  Ryer's soggy estate was on the point of breaking loose and seemed ready  to float away.    The stingy fellow, as he fell overboard, bumped his head so hard on the  plough beam, that he lay senseless for a half hour. He would certainly  have been drowned, had not Pete, his stout son, who was not far away,  and had seen the tumble, ran to the house, launched a boat and rowed  quickly to the spot, where he had last seen his father. Grabbing his  daddy by the collar, he hauled him, half dead, into the boat. Between  his bump and his fright, and the cold bath, old Ryer was a long time  coming to his wits. With filial piety, Pete kept on rubbing the paternal  hands and restoring the circulation.    All this, however, took a long time, even an hour or more. When his  father was able to sit up and talk, Pete started to row back to the  little wharf in front of his home.    But where was it,--the farm, with the house and fields? Whither had they  gone? Ryer was too mystified to get his bearings, but Pete knew the  points of the compass. Yet his father's farm was not there. He looked at  the shore of Overijssel, which he had left. Instead of the old, straight  lines of willow trees, with the church spire beyond, there was a hollow  and empty place. It looked as if a giant, as big as the world itself,  had bitten out a piece of land and swallowed it down. Dumbfounded,  father and son looked, the one at the other, but said nothing, for there  was nothing to say.    Meanwhile, what had become of the farm and \"the Queezel,\" as the  neighbors still called her--that is, the mother with the children. These  good people soon saw that they were floating off somewhere. The mainland  was every moment receding further into the distance. In fact, the farm  was moving from Overijssel northward, towards Friesland. One by one, the  church spires of the village near by faded from sight.    But when the wind changed from south to west, they seemed as if on a  ship, with sails set, and to be making due west, for North Holland. The  younger children, so far from being afraid, clapped their hands in glee.  They thought it great fun to ferry across the big water, which they had  so long seen before their eyes. Their stingy father had never owned a  carriage, or allowed the horses to be ridden. He always made his family  walk to church. Whether it were to the sermon, in the morning, or to  hear the catechism expounded by the Domine, in the afternoon, all the  family had to tramp on their wooden shoes there and back.    As for the floating farm, the cows could not understand it. They mooed  piteously, while the donkey brayed loudly. At night, and day after day,  no one could attend properly to the animals, to see that they were fed  and given water. One always sees a big tub in the middle of a Dutch  pasture field. Neither ducks, nor geese, nor chickens minded it in the  least, but the thirsty cattle and horses, at the end of the first day,  had drunk the tub dry. None of the dumb brutes, even if they had not  been afraid of being drowned, could drink from the Zuyder Zee, for it  was chiefly sea water, that is, salt, or at least brackish.    Occasionally this errant farm, that had thus broken loose, passed by  fishermen, who wondered at so much land thus adrift. Yet they feared to  hail, and go on board, lest the owners might think them intruding.  Others thought it none of their business, supposing some crazy fellow  was using his farm as a ship, to move his lands, goods and household,  and thus save expense. In some of the villages, the runaway farm was  descried from the tops of the church towers. Then, it furnished a  subject for chat and gossip, during three days, to the women, as they  milked the cows, or knitted stockings. To the men, also, while they  smoked, or drank their coffee, it was a lively topic.    \"There were real people on it and a house and stables,\" said the sexton  of a church, who declared that he had seen this new sort of a flying  Dutchman. It was the usual sight--\"cow, dog, and stork,\" and then he  quoted the old Dutch proverb.    At last, after several days, and when Ryer and his son were nearly  finished, with fatigue and fright, in trying to row their boat to catch  up with the runaway farm, they finally reached a village across the  Zuyder Zee, in North Holland, where rye bread and turnips satisfied  their hunger and they had waffles for dessert. Their small change went  quickly, and then the two men were at their wit's end to know what  further to do.    By this time, out on the floating farm, the mother and children were  wild with fear of starving. All the food for the cattle had been eaten  up, the dog had no meat, the cat no milk, and the stork had run out of  its supply of frogs. There was no sugar or coffee, and neither rye nor  currant-bread, or sliced sausage or wafer-thin cheese for any one; but  only potatoes and some barley grain. Happily, however, in drifting  within sight of the village of Osterbeek, the mother and the children  noticed that the east wind was freshening. Soon they descried the tops  of the church towers of North Holland. The smell of cows and cheese and  of burning peat fires from the chimneys made both animals and human  beings happy, as the wind blew the island westward to the village.    Curiously enough, this was the very place at which, by hard rowing, Ryer  and Pete had also arrived. Father and son were sitting in the hotel  parlor, with their eyes down on the sandy floor, wondering how they were  to pay for their next sandwich and coffee, for their money was all gone.    At that moment, a small boy clattered over the bricks in his klomps. He  kicked these off, at the door, and rushed into the room. He had on his  yellow baggy trousers and his hair, of the same color, was cut level  with his ears. Half out of breath, he announced the coming, afloat, of  what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#19)"],[1,"leader  and galloped nearly a hundred miles to overtake him. Fremont gave  the mountaineer most cordial greeting and insisted so strongly on his  accompanying him that Carson could not refuse.    The object of Fremont's second exploration was to connect the survey of  the previous year with those of Commander Wilkes on the Pacific coast.  The first objective point was the Great Salt Lake of Utah, of which very  little was known at that time.    Carson was sent back to the fort to procure a number of mules. He did as  directed and rejoined Fremont at St. Vrain's Fort. The region traversed  by these explorers is so well known today that it is hard to realize  what a terra incognita it was but a short time since. Perhaps it will  be most instructive at this point to quote the words of the great  Pathfinder himself. The party arrived on the 21st of August on the  Bear River, one of the principal tributaries of Great Salt Lake. The  narrative of Fremont proceeds:    \"We were now entering a region, which for us possessed a strange and  extraordinary interest. We were upon the waters of the famous lake which  forms a salient point among the remarkable geographical features of the  country, and around which the vague and superstitious accounts of  the trappers had thrown a delightful obscurity, which we anticipated  pleasure in dispelling, but which, in the meantime, left a crowded field  for the exercise of our imagination.    \"In our occasional conversations with the few old hunters who had  visited the region, it had been a subject of frequent speculation; and  the wonders which they related were not the less agreeable because they  were highly exaggerated and impossible.    \"Hitherto this lake had been seen only by trappers, who were wandering  through the country in search of new beaver streams, caring very little  for geography; its islands had never been visited; and none were to  be found who had entirely made the circuit of its shores, and no  instrumental observations, or geographical survey of any description,  had ever been made anywhere in the neighboring region. It was generally  supposed that it had no visible outlet; but, among the trappers,  including those in my own camp, were many who believed that somewhere  on its surface was a terrible whirlpool, through which its waters found  their way to the ocean by some subterranean communication. All these  things had been made a frequent subject of discussion in our desultory  conversations around the fires at night; and my own mind had become  tolerably well filled with their indefinite pictures, and insensibly  colored with their romantic descriptions, which, in the pleasure  of excitement, I was well disposed to believe, and half expected to  realize.    \"In about six miles' travel from our encampment we reached one of the  points in our journey to which we had always looked forward with great  interest--the famous Beer Springs, which, on account of the effervescing  gas and acid taste, had received their name from the voyageurs and  trappers of the country, who, in the midst of their rude and hard lives,  are fond of finding some fancied resemblance to the luxuries they rarely  have the good fortune to enjoy.    \"Although somewhat disappointed in the expectations which various  descriptions had led me to form of unusual beauty of situation and  scenery, I found it altogether a place of very great interest; and a  traveller for the first time in a volcanic region remains in a constant  excitement, and at every step is arrested by something remarkable and  new. There is a confusion of interesting objects gathered together in  a small space. Around the place of encampment the Beer Springs were  numerous but, as far as we could ascertain, were entirely confined to  that locality in the bottom. In the bed of the river in front, for  a space of several hundred yards, they were very abundant; the  effervescing gas rising up and agitating the water in countless bubbling  columns. In the vicinity round about were numerous springs of an  entirely different and equally marked mineral character. In a rather  picturesque spot, about 1,300 yards below our encampment and immediately  on the river bank, is the most remarkable spring of the place. In an  opening on the rock, a white column of scattered water is thrown up, in  form, like a jet d'eau, to a variable height of about three feet, and,  though it is maintained in a constant supply, its greatest height is  attained only at regular intervals, according to the action of the force  below. It is accompanied by a subterranean noise, which, together with  the motion of the water, makes very much the impression of a steamboat  in motion; and, without knowing that it had been already previously so  called, we gave to it the name of the Steamboat Spring. The rock through  which it is forced is slightly raised in a convex manner, and gathered  at the opening into an urn mouthed form, and is evidently formed by  continued deposition from the water, and colored bright red by oxide of  iron.    \"It is a hot spring, and the water has a pungent, disagreeable metallic  taste, leaving a burning effect on the tongue. Within perhaps two yards  of the jet d'eau, is a small hole of about an inch in diameter, through  which, at regular intervals, escapes a blast of hot air with a light  wreath of smoke, accompanied by a regular noise.    \"As they approached the lake, they passed over a country of bold and  striking scenery, and through several 'gates,' as they called certain  narrow valleys. The 'standing rock' is a huge column, occupying the  centre of one of these passes. It fell from a height of perhaps 3,000  feet, and happened to remain in its present upright position.    \"At last, on the 6th of September, the object for which their eyes had  long been straining was brought to view.    \"September 6.--This time we reached the butte without any difficulty;  and ascending to the summit, immediately at our feet beheld the object  of our anxious search, the waters of the Inland Sea, stretching in still  and solitary grandeur, far beyond the limit of our vision. It was one of  the great points of the exploration; and as we looked eagerly over the  lake in the first emotions of excited pleasure, I am doubtful if the  followers of Balboa felt more enthusiasm when, from the heights of  the Andes, they saw for the first time the great Western Ocean. It was  certainly a magnificent object, and a noble terminus to this part of our  expedition; and to travellers so long shut up among mountain ranges,  a sudden view over the expanse of silent waters had in it something  sublime. Several large islands raised their high rocky heads out of  the waves; but whether or not they were timbered was still left to our  imagination, as the distance was too great to determine if the dark hues  upon them were woodland or naked rock. During the day the clouds had  been gathering black over the mountains to the westward, and while we  were looking, a storm burst down with sudden fury upon the lake, and  entirely hid the islands from our view.    \"On the edge of the stream a favorable spot was selected in a grove,  and felling the timber, we made a strong corral, or horse pen, for the  animals, and a little fort for the people who were to remain. We were  now probably in the country of the Utah Indians, though none reside upon  the lake. The India rubber boat was repaired with prepared cloth and  gum, and filled with air, in readiness for the next day.    \"The provisions which Carson had brought with him being now exhausted,  and our stock reduced to a small quantity of roots, I determined to  retain with me only a sufficient number of men for the execution of our  design; and accordingly seven were sent back to Fort Hall, under the  guidance of Francois Lajeunesse, who, having been for many years a  trapper in the country, was an experienced mountaineer.    \"We formed now but a small family. With Mr. Preuss and myself,  Carson, Bernier, and Basil Lajeunesse had been selected for the boat  expedition--the first ever attempted on this interior sea; and Badau,  with Derosier, and Jacob (the colored man), were to be left in charge  of the camp. We were favored with most delightful weather. Tonight  there was a brilliant sunset of golden orange and green, which left the  western sky clear and beautifully pure; but clouds in the east made me  lose an occulation. The summer frogs were singing around us, and the  evening was very pleasant, with a temperature of 60 degrees--a night  of a more southern autumn. For our supper, we had yampak, the most  agreeably flavored of the roots, seasoned by a small fat duck, which  had come in the way of Jacob's rifle. Around our fire tonight were  many speculations on what tomorrow would bring forth; and in our busy  conjectures we fancied that we should find every one of the large  islands a tangled wilderness of trees and shrubbery, teeming with game  of every description that the neighboring region afforded, and which the  foot of a white man or Indian had never violated. Frequently, during the  day, clouds had rested on the summits of their lofty mountains, and we  believed that we should find clear streams and springs of fresh water;  and we indulged in anticipations of the luxurious repasts with which  we were to indemnify ourselves for past privations. Neither, in our  discussions, were the whirlpool and other mysterious dangers forgotten,  which Indian and hunter's stories attributed to this unexplored lake.  The men had discovered that, instead of being strongly sewed, (like that  of the preceding year, which had so triumphantly rode the canons of the  Upper Great Platte), our present boat was only pasted together in a very  insecure manner, the maker having been allowed so little time in the  construction that he was obliged to crowd the labor of two months into  several days. The insecurity of the boat was"]]]
