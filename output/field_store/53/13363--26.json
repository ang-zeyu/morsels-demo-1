But still--still, we don't  have no luck.\"    \"Well, then, if we fight like the devil an' don't ever whip, it must be  the general's fault,\" said the youth grandly and decisively.  \"And I  don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting, yet always  losing through some derned old lunkhead of a general.\"    A sarcastic man who was tramping at the youth's side, then spoke  lazily.  \"Mebbe yeh think yeh fit th' hull battle yestirday, Fleming,\"  he remarked.    The speech pierced the youth.  Inwardly he was reduced to an abject  pulp by these chance words.  His legs quaked privately.  He cast a  frightened glance at the sarcastic man.    \"Why, no,\" he hastened to say in a conciliating voice \"I don't think I  fought the whole battle yesterday.\"    But the other seemed innocent of any deeper meaning.  Apparently, he  had no information.  It was merely his habit.  \"Oh!\" he replied in the  same tone of calm derision.    The youth, nevertheless, felt a threat.  His mind shrank from going  near to the danger, and thereafter he was silent.  The significance of  the sarcastic man's words took from him all loud moods that would make  him appear prominent.  He became suddenly a modest person.    There was low-toned talk among the troops.  The officers were impatient  and snappy, their countenances clouded with the tales of misfortune.  The troops, sifting through the forest, were sullen.  In the youth's  company once a man's laugh rang out.  A dozen soldiers turned their  faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure.    The noise of firing dogged their footsteps.  Sometimes, it seemed to be  driven a little way, but it always returned again with increased  insolence.  The men muttered and cursed, throwing black looks in its  direction.    In a clear space the troops were at last halted.  Regiments and  brigades, broken and detached through their encounters with thickets,  grew together again and lines were faced toward the pursuing bark of  the enemy's infantry.    This noise, following like the yelpings of eager, metallic hounds,  increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went  serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy  thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings.  The woods began to  crackle as if afire.    \"Whoop-a-dadee,\" said a man, \"here we are!  Everybody fightin'.  Blood  an' destruction.\"    \"I was willin' t' bet they'd attack as soon as th' sun got fairly up,\"  savagely asserted the lieutenant who commanded the youth's company.  He  jerked without mercy at his little mustache.  He strode to and fro with  dark dignity in the rear of his men, who were lying down behind  whatever protection they had collected.    A battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfully  shelling the distance.  The regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the  moment when the gray shadows of the woods before them should be slashed  by the lines of flame.  There was much growling and swearing.    \"Good Gawd,\" the youth grumbled, \"we're always being chased around like  rats!  It makes me sick.  Nobody seems to know where we go or why we  go.  We just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here  and get licked there, and nobody knows what it's done for.  It makes a  man feel like a damn' kitten in a bag.  Now, I'd like to know what the  eternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow, unless it  was to give the rebs a regular pot shot at us.  We came in here and got  our legs all tangled up in these cussed briers, and then we begin to  fight and the rebs had an easy time of it.  Don't tell me it's just  luck!  I know better.  It's this derned old--\"    The friend seemed jaded, but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of  calm confidence.  \"It'll turn out all right in th' end,\" he said.    \"Oh, the devil it will!  You always talk like a dog-hanged parson.  Don't tell me!  I know--\"    At this time there was an interposition by the savage-minded  lieutenant, who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction  upon his men.  \"You boys shut right up! There no need 'a your wastin'  your breath in long-winded arguments about this an' that an' th' other.  You've been jawin' like a lot 'a old hens.  All you've got t' do is to  fight, an' you'll get plenty 'a that t' do in about ten minutes.  Less  talkin' an' more fightin' is what's best for you boys.  I never saw  sech gabbling jackasses.\"    He paused, ready to pounce upon any man who might have the temerity to  reply.  No words being said, he resumed his dignified pacing.    \"There's too much chin music an' too little fightin' in this war,  anyhow,\" he said to them, turning his head for a final remark.    The day had grown more white, until the sun shed his full radiance upon  the thronged forest.  A sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward  that part of the line where lay the youth's regiment.  The front  shifted a trifle to meet it squarely.  There was a wait.  In this part  of the field there passed slowly the intense moments that precede the  tempest.    A single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment.  In an instant  it was joined by many others.  There was a mighty song of clashes and  crashes that went sweeping through the woods.  The guns in the rear,  aroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burr-like at them,  suddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band  of guns.  The battle roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a  single, long explosion.    In the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the  attitudes of the men.  They were worn, exhausted, having slept but  little and labored much.  They rolled their eyes toward the advancing  battle as they stood awaiting the shock.  Some shrank and flinched.  They stood as men tied to stakes.          Chapter 17      This advance of the enemy had seemed to the youth like a ruthless  hunting. He began to fume with rage and exasperation.  He beat his foot  upon the ground, and scowled with hate at the swirling smoke that was  approaching like a phantom flood.  There was a maddening quality in  this seeming resolution of the foe to give him no rest, to give him no  time to sit down and think.  Yesterday he had fought and had fled  rapidly.  There had been many adventures.  For to-day he felt that he  had earned opportunities for contemplative repose.  He could have  enjoyed portraying to uninitiated listeners various scenes at which he  had been a witness or ably discussing the processes of war with other  proved men.  Too it was important that he should have time for physical  recuperation.  He was sore and stiff from his experiences.  He had  received his fill of all exertions, and he wished to rest.    But those other men seemed never to grow weary; they were fighting with  their old speed.  He had a wild hate for the relentless foe.  Yesterday, when he had imagined the universe to be against him, he had  hated it, little gods and big gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe  with the same great hatred.  He was not going to be badgered of his  life, like a kitten chased by boys, he said.  It was not well to drive  men into final corners; at those moments they could all develop teeth  and claws.    He leaned and spoke into his friend's ear.  He menaced the woods with a  gesture.  \"If they keep on chasing us, by Gawd, they'd better watch  out.  Can't stand TOO much.\"    The friend twisted his head and made a calm reply.  \"If they keep on  a-chasin' us they'll drive us all inteh th' river.\"    The youth cried out savagely at this statement.  He crouched behind a  little tree, with his eyes burning hatefully and his teeth set in a  curlike snarl.  The awkward bandage was still about his head, and upon  it, over his wound, there was a spot of dry blood.  His hair was  wondrously tousled, and some straggling, moving locks hung over the  cloth of the bandage down toward his forehead.  His jacket and shirt  were open at the throat, and exposed his young bronzed neck.  There  could be seen spasmodic gulpings at his throat.    His fingers twined nervously about his rifle.  He wished that it was an  engine of annihilating power.  He felt that he and his companions were  being taunted and derided from sincere convictions that they were poor  and puny.  His knowledge of his inability to take vengeance for it made  his rage into a dark and stormy specter, that possessed him and made  him dream of abominable cruelties.  The tormentors were flies sucking  insolently at his blood, and he thought that he would have given his  life for a revenge of seeing their faces in pitiful plights.    The winds of battle had swept all about the regiment, until the one  rifle, instantly followed by others, flashed in its front.  A moment  later the regiment roared forth its sudden and valiant retort.  A dense  wall of smoke settled down.  It was furiously slit and slashed by the  knifelike fire from the rifles.    To the youth the fighters resembled animals tossed for a death struggle  into a dark pit.  There was a sensation that he and his fellows, at  bay, were pushing back, always pushing fierce onslaughts of creatures  who were slippery.  Their beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase  upon the bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade them with  ease, and come through, between, around, and about with unopposed skill.    When, in a dream, it occurred to the youth that his rifle was an  impotent stick, he lost sense of everything but his hate, his desire to  smash into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he could feel  upon the faces of his enemies.    The blue smoke-swallowed line curled and writhed like a snake stepped  upon.  It swung its ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.    The youth was not conscious that he was erect upon his feet.  He did  not know the direction of the ground.  Indeed, once he even lost the  habit of balance and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#19)"],[1,"seems evident to me that the Woman-Suffrage movement no more grew  logically out of the great discussions on human bondage which began with  Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Hamilton, and John Jay, and ended  with Sumner, Seward, and Lincoln, than the communes of this country grew  out of the utterances of the Fathers based on the declaration that \"All  men are created equal, and are endowed with certain inalienable rights,  among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"    It was among those whose mistaken zeal and wild conduct were most  mischievous, that the Suffrage sentiment gathered head. Their lack of  judgment in defying the opinions of their own sex, as well as of the  other, their wrapt forgetfulness of proprieties, which incited mobs and  proved a fine tool for the frenzy of so-called social reformers, brought  contempt upon womanhood as well as upon the cause they advocated. Women,  in the churches and out, were the strength of the Anti-slavery movement;  but not these women. As to the notable meeting in London, had the  delegates been the highest and largest minded and most cultured of their  sex, and had their cause been the noblest, they and it would have been  dishonored by the method of its presentation. American women of to-day  would no more applaud such conduct than did those of fifty years ago.  Women have won lasting public favor and place, while Suffrage has won an  uneasy footing by unenviable methods.    This survey enables us to understand what otherwise would seem most  strange, how the women of the Suffrage movement, in claiming the right of  suffrage, ignored the duties and powers based upon and connected with it--  those that formed the defence which made possible any such nation as ours.  Added to the extreme Quaker doctrine of peace-at-any-price, was the  fanatical notion of the sinfulness of all war, all use of physical force,  and a cool assumption that opinion was law. Mrs. Maria Chapman read, at  one of the early Woman's-Rights conventions, a string of verses that  reveals the absurdity of the situation. It was in reply to \"A Clerical  Appeal,\" issued by the Rev. Nehemiah Adams, whose \"South-Side View of  Slavery\" received more Anti-slavery attention than it deserved, for it  expressed only his own fantastic ideas. In the \"Appeal\" he maintains that  women should paint in water colors only, not in oil. Mrs. Chapman says:      \"Our patriot fathers, of eloquent fame,       Waged war against tangible forms;     Aye, _their_ foes were men--and if ours were the same,       We might speedily quiet their storms;     But, ah! their descendants enjoy not such bliss,       The assumptions of Britain were nothing to this.      \"Could we but array all our force in the field,       We'd teach these usurpers of power     That their bodily safety demands they should yield,       And in presence of womanhood cower;     But alas! for our tethered and impotent state,     Chained by notions of knighthood--we can but debate.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"Oh! shade of the prophet Mahomet, arise!       Place woman again in her 'sphere,'     And teach that her soul was not born for the skies,       But to flutter a brief moment here.     This doctrine of Jesus, as preached up by Paul,       If embraced in its spirit will ruin us all.\"    Mention of Mrs. Chapman recalls her attitude toward Frederick Douglass and  the further fact that he became an advocate of Suffrage. In his \"Life and  Times\" he says: \"I could not meet her [Mrs. Stanton's] arguments except  with the shallow plea of 'custom,' 'natural division of duties,'  'indelicacy of woman's taking part in politics,' 'the common talk of  woman's sphere,' and the like, all of which that able woman brushed away  by those arguments which no man has yet successfully refuted.\" Mr.  Douglass might have called to mind the fact, to the recognition of which  he had been so thoroughly converted, and which he set forth on page 460 of  his book, when he wrote: \"I insisted that the liberties of the American  people were dependent upon the ballot-box, the jury-box, and the  cartridge-box.\" He forgot that Mrs. Stanton, in defiance of those social  laws that had weight with him, was asking to use the first, to use  partially the second, and to ignore the third, on which both of the others  depend for continuance.    The \"History\" is dedicated to Harriet Martineau (among other women) as one  who influenced the starting of the Suffrage movement. Turning to Miss  Martineau's \"Society in America,\" published in 1837, I find the following  in her account of the Anti-slavery movement in the United States: \"The  progress of the Abolition question within three years throughout the whole  of the rural districts of the North, is a far stronger testimony to the  virtue of the nation than the noisy clamor of a portion of the  slaveholders of the South, and the merchant aristocracy of the North, and  the silence of the clergy, against it. The nation must not be judged of by  that portion whose worldly interests are involved in the maintenance of  the anomaly; nor yet by the eight hundred flourishing Abolition societies  of the North, with all the supporters they have in unassociated  individuals. If it be found that the five Abolitionists who first met in a  little chamber five years ago, to measure their moral strength against  this national enormity, have become a host beneath whose assaults the  vicious institution is rocking to its foundations, it is time that slavery  was ceasing to be a national reproach.\"    An observer who could be made to believe that these five Abolitionists had  really accomplished more toward the overthrow of slavery than eight  hundred flourishing Abolition societies and their outside supporters, and  that the great body of clergymen were silent, because they did not adopt  the methods of the five who set themselves against church and state, shows  a credulity that leads one to question the information and the conclusions  on which her judgment of the relation of American women to the Republic  were based.    As a proof that when women entered into public work in a womanly way they  found support from the church and the Abolitionists, we may point to  perhaps the first organized charitable and industrial work done among  women in this country. In 1834 Mrs. Charles Hawking, of New York City, had  convened in the Third Free Church, corner of Houston and Thompson streets,  a meeting which resulted in the immediate formation of \"The Moral Reform  Society.\" Clergymen who were in sympathy with the movement addressed the  meeting. \"The Female Guardian Society\" was founded by them a year later,  and a newspaper was established to present its claims. The officers were  women. They visited the Tombs, and held weekly prayer-meetings. They  secured the legislation necessary to bring about the separation of men and  women in the city prisons, and the appointment of matrons for the women.  In 1853 they procured an enactment \"whereby dissipated and vicious  parents, by habitually neglecting due care and provision for their  offspring, shall forfeit their natural claim to them, and whereby such  children shall be removed from them and placed under better influences  till the claim of the parents shall be re-established by continued  sobriety, industry, and general good conduct.\" They secured the passage of  the Truant Act, and the appointment of Truant Officers. Mr. Lewis Tappan  was not only the auditor for the organization, but gave effective help by  suggestions that led to the establishment of the first Home for the  Friendless, of which there are now seven in charge of the society. In  1854, Industrial schools were added. Cooking, housekeeping, kindergarten,  and fresh-air work developed rapidly. There are now twelve industrial  schools, where six thousand children are taught. The report of the first  semi-annual meeting, held in Utica, N. Y., is in quaint contrast to the  reports of the first Suffrage meetings. They say: \"The utmost harmony and  union of feeling have characterized all the proceedings, and as we looked  around and saw the intelligence and piety and moral worth that was  assembled there, and listened to the discussion of subjects of practical  importance, while every one was manifestly seeking to know and do her  duty, we could not but feel that the most determined opposer of 'women's  meetings' would have found nothing to censure had he been present. There  has been no frivolity, no fanaticism, no disorder. We are sure that not a  wife or mother was there who was not at least as well disposed and  prepared to discharge her relative duties as she would have been if she  had kept at home.\"    Upon the great cause of Temperance, also, the Woman-Suffrage movement  early laid a blighting hand. As will be remembered, total abstinence was  one of the doctrines to which many of the no-government, common-property,  men and women were pledged. Western and Central New York has been the  birthplace of some of the wildest and most destructive movements that our  social life has witnessed. If the year 1848, which saw the beginnings of  the Woman-Suffrage movement, was wonderful for revolutions and  insurrections the world over, the years that preceded it were remarkable,  especially in this country and this State, for some of the maddest  vagaries that ever have been known here. There and then arose the Shaker  excitement, so fantastic that only now and then was the outside world  permitted to know what was being done. Then and there Fourierism found its  most fruitful field, and of the dozen or more communities that were  started, several united in forming, near Rochester, an Industrial Union.  John Collins started a number of vague branches of what the Fourierites  called the \"no-God, no-government, no-marriage, no-money, no-meat, no-  salt, no-pepper\" system of community. Here John H.
