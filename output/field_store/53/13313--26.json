[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],[0,"The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#19)"],[1," to the time  when the book of Chronicles was compiled, seems to tally remarkably  with the tradition concerning its authorship. Notwithstanding this  agreement, however, the authenticity of Chronicles has been vehemently  impugned by De Wette and other German critics, whose arguments have  been successfully refuted by Dahler, Keil, Movers, and others. It has  been clearly shown that the attack was grounded not upon any real  marks of spuriousness in the books themselves, but solely upon the  desire of the critics in question to remove a witness whose evidence  was fatal to their favorite theory as to the post-Babylonian origin of  the books of Moses. If the accounts in the books of Chronicles of the  courses of priests and Levites, and the ordinances of divine service as  arranged by David, and restored by Hezekiah and Josiah, are genuine,  it necessarily follows that the Levitical law, as set forth in the  Pentateuch, was not invented after the return from the captivity. Hence  the successful vindication of the authenticity of Chronicles has a very  important bearing upon many of the very gravest theological questions.\"  (Smith's Bible Dictionary, p. 429.)    4. _Compilation and Spirit of the Books of Chronicles:_ \"Though the  latest of all the canonical writings, it represents the workmanship  of many generations. It resembles the structure of an ancient  cathedral, with fragments of every style worked into the building  as it proceeded,--here a piece of the most hoary antiquity, there a  precious relic of a lost hymn or genealogy of some renowned psalmist or  warrior,--but all preserved, and wrought together, as by the workmen  of mediaeval times, under the guidance of the same sacerdotal mind,  with the spirit of the same priestly order. Far below the prophetic  books of the Kings in interest and solidity, it yet furnishes a useful  counterpart by filling up the voids with materials which none but  the peculiar traditions and feelings of the Levitical caste could  have supplied. It is the culminating point of the purely Levitical  system, both in what it relates, in what it omits, and the manner of  its relations and omissions.\" (Dean Stanley, quoted in Smith's Bible  Dictionary, p. 432.)    5. _The Birth Right to Joseph:_ \"It should be remembered that to  Joseph, the son of Jacob, a double portion of honor was granted in  Israel. While no tribe is especially called by his name, yet two tribes  are his through his sons, viz., the tribe of Ephraim and the tribe of  Manasseh. This came about in the following manner: Reuben, the first  born of Jacob defiled his father's wife Bilhah. For which awful crime  he lost his place as a prince in the house of Israel, which place was  given indirectly to Joseph, the son of Jacob, by his wife Rachel. Why  I say indirectly is because Ephraim, Joseph's younger son, was the one  who received the blessing of the first born from the patriarch Jacob,  and it is for this reason that the Lord was wont to say, \"I am a father  to Israel, and Ephraim is my first born.\" In proof see Special Text of  lesson; also Y.

C., and that of Nehemiah stops soon after the thirty-second year  of Artaxerxes, 432 B. C. A great part of this space, however, is left  without record; and we may distinguish three periods: 1. The period  that elapsed from the first return of exiles to the completion of the  temple; 2. the time of Ezra's activity as leader of the second colony  of returned exiles; and 3, the period when Ezra and Nehemiah are seen  together in the work of reformation at Jerusalem. The first two periods  are embraced in the book of Ezra; the last, in the book of Nehemiah.\"  (Bible Treasury, p. 69.)    2. _Book of Ezra. Protestant View:_ \"The Book of Ezra contains records  of events occurring about the termination of the Babylonian exile. It  comprises accounts of the favors bestowed upon the Jews by Persian  kings; of the rebuilding of the temple; of the mission of Ezra to  Jerusalem, and his regulations and reforms. Such records forming  the subject of the Book of Ezra, we must not be surprised that its  parts are not so intimately connected with each other as we might  have expected if the author had set forth his intention to furnish  a complete history of his times. * * * * The beginning of the book  of Ezra agrees verbatum with the conclusion of the second book of  Chronicles, and terminates abruptly with the statement of the divorces  affected by his authority, by which the marriages of Israelites with  foreign women were dissolved. Since the book of Ezra has no marked  conclusion, it was, even in early times, considered to form part  of the book of Nehemiah, the contents of which are of a similar  description. As, however, the book of Ezra is a collection of records  of remarkable events occurring at the conclusion of the exile and in  the times immediately following it, attempting no display of the art  of book-making, the mere want of an artificial conclusion cannot be  considered a sufficient reason for regarding it as the first portion of  Nehemiah. It is, however, likely that the similarity of the contents  of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah was the cause of their being placed  together in the Hebrew Bible.\" (Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature,  Kitto, p. 690.)    3. _Catholic View of the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah:_    (a) _Ezra_, called by Catholics \"Esdras:\" \"This book taketh its name  from the writer: who was a holy priest, and doctor of the law. He is  called by the Hebrews Ezra.\"    (b) _Nehemiah_--Catholic form of name, \"Nehemias:\" \"This book takes  its name from the writer, who was cup-bearer to Artaxerxes (surnamed  Longimanus) king of Persia, and was sent by him with a commission to  rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. It is also called the Second Book of  Esdras; because it is a continuation of the history, begun by Esdras,  of the state of the people of God after their return from captivity.\"  (Introductions in Douay Bible to First and Second Book of Esdras.)    4. _Book of Esther:_ \"Esther derives its name from the Jewish lady,  who, having become wife of the king of Persia, employed her royal  influence to effect a memorable deliverance for the persecuted  Church of God. Various opinions are embraced and supported as to the  authorship of this book, some ascribing it to Ezra, to Nehemiah, and to  Mordecai. The preponderance of authorities is in favor of the last.\"  (Commentary, Critical and Explanatory, p 8.)    5. _Historical Character:_ \"The historical character of the book of  Esther is undoubted, since, besides many internal evidences, its  authenticity is proved by the strong testimony of the feast of Purim,  the celebration of which can be traced up to the events which are  described in this book. Its claim, however, to canonical authority, has  been questioned on the ground that the name of God does not once occur  in it. But the uniform tradition both of the Jewish and the Christian  churches supports this claim, which nothing in the book tends to shake;  while it is a record of the superintending care of divine providence  over his chosen people, with which it is of the utmost importance  the church should be furnished. The name of God is strangely enough  omitted, but the presence of God is felt throughout the history; and  the whole tone and tendency of the book is so decidedly subservient  to the honor of God and the cause of true religion that it has been  generally received by the Church in all ages into the sacred canon.\"  (Commentary, Critical and Explanatory, p. 8.)    6. _Purim:_ \"A celebrated Jewish festival instituted by Mordecai, at  the suggestion of Esther, in the reign of Ahasuerus, king of Persia,  to commemorate the deliverance of the Jews from the designs of Haman.  It derived its name from the lots cast every day for twelve months in  presence of Haman, with the view of discovering an auspicious day for  the destruction of all the Jews in the Persian dominion; when the lot  fell on the 13th day of Adar (February and part of March).\" (Kitto's  Biblical Literature, p. 588.)    \"The fact that the feast of Purim has come down to us from time almost  immemorial,\" says"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#19)"],[1,"placed an intellectual and  sensible gorilla, two years of age, in the hands of a family  specially fitted by education and home surroundings to develop its  mind and its manners. The results of those efforts have given to  the gorilla an entirely new mental status. Thanks to the  enterprise and diligence of Major Rupert Penny and Miss Cunningham  in purchasing and caring for a sick and miserable young male  gorilla,--a most hazardous risk,--a new chapter in wild-animal  psychology now is to be written.    In December, 1918, \"John Gorilla\" was purchased in a London  department store, out of a daily atmosphere heated to _85  degrees_, and a nightly condition of solitude and terror. From  that awful state it was taken to live in Major Penny's comfortable  apartments. John was seriously ill. He was in a \"rickety\"  condition, and he weighed only 32 pounds. With a pure atmosphere,  kept at 65 degrees only, and amid good surroundings, he soon  became well. He attained such robust health and buoyant spirits  that in March, 1921, he stood 40 1/2 inches high and weighed 112  pounds.    At my solicitation Miss Cunningham wrote out for me the very  remarkable personal history of that wonderful animal,--apparently  the most wonderful gorilla ever observed in captivity. It is a  clear, straightforward and convincing record, and not one of its  statements is to be for one moment doubted. While it is too long  to reproduce here in its entirety, I will present a condensation  of it, in Miss Cunningham's own words that will record the salient  facts,--with no changes save in arrangement.    Miss Cunningham says:    LONELINESS. \"We soon found it was impossible to leave him alone at  night, because he shrieked every night, and nearly all night, from  loneliness and fear. This we found he had done in the store where  he lived before coming to us. He always began to cry directly he  saw the assistants putting things away for the night. We found  that this loneliness at night was trying on his health and  appetite. As soon as possible my nephew had his bed made up every  night in the room adjoining the cage, with the result that John  was quite happy, and began to grow and put on fat.    TREATMENT. \"I fed him, washed his hands, face and feet twice a  day, and brushed and combed his hair,--which he would try to do  himself whenever he got hold of the brush or comb. He soon got to  like all this.    TRAINING. \"My next idea was to teach him to be strictly clean in  his habits. It was my ambition to be able to have him upstairs in  our house as an ordinary member of the household. I taught him  first as a child is taught and handled. This took some time. At  first I could not make him understand what we expected of him,  even though I always petted him and gave him grapes (of which he  was especially fond), but I think at first he imagined that this  treatment was a punishment. At first, without other reasons, he  would roll on the floor and shriek, but directly he understood  what was expected of him he soon learned, and began to behave  excellently.    \"This training occupied quite six weeks. About February, 1919, we  took him out of his cage, and allowed him the freedom of the  house. Thereafter he would run upstairs to the bathroom of his own  accord, turning the doorknob of whatever room he was in, and also  opening the door of the bathroom.... He would get out of bed in  the night by himself, go back to bed, and pull the blankets over  himself quite neatly.    FOOD. \"John's appetite seemed to tire of foods very quickly. The  only thing he stuck to was milk, which he liked best when warmed.  We began by giving him a quart a day, rising to three and one-half  quarts a day. I found that he preferred to choose his own food, so  I used to prepare for him several kinds, such as bananas, oranges,  apples, grapes, raisins, currants, dates and any small fruits in  season, such as raspberries or strawberries, _all of which he  liked to have warmed!_    \"These displays I placed on a high shelf in the kitchen, where he  could get them with difficulty. I think that he thought himself  very clever when he stole anything. He never would eat anything  stale. He was extremely fond of fresh lemon jelly, but he never  would touch it after the second day. He loved roses, _to  eat_, more than anything. The more beautiful they were, the  more he liked them, but he never would eat faded roses. He never  cared much for nuts of any other kind than baked peanuts, save  walnuts. I found that nuts gave him dreadful spells of  indigestion.    USE OF TOOLS. \"He knew what hammers and chisels were for, but for  obvious reasons we never encouraged him in anything to do with  carpentry. With cocoanuts he was very funny. He knew that they had  to be broken, and he would try to break them on the floor. When he  found he couldn't manage that, he would bring the nut to one of us  and try to make us understand what he wished. If we gave him a  hammer he would try to use it on the nut, and on not being able to  manage that, he would give back to us both the hammer and the  cocoanut.    GAMES AND PLAY. \"We never taught him any tricks; he simply  acquired knowledge himself. A game he was very fond of was to  pretend he was blind, shutting his eyes very tightly, and running  around the room knocking against tables and chairs. . . . We found  that exercise was the thing he required to keep him in health, and  my nephew used to give him plenty of that by playing hide and seek  with him in the morning before breakfast, and in the evening  before dinner,--up and down stairs, in and out of all the rooms.  He simply loved that game, and would giggle and laugh while being  chased.... If he saw that a stranger was at all nervous about him,  he loved running past him, and giving him a smack on the leg,--and  you could see him grin as he did so.    \"A thing he greatly enjoyed was to stand on the top rail of his  bed and jump on the springs, head over heels, just like a child.    CAUTION. \"He was very cautious. He would never run into a dark  room without first turning on the light.    FEAR. \"John seemed to realize danger for other people in high  places, for if anyone looked out of a high window he always pushed  them away if he were at the window himself, but if he was away  from it he would run and pull them back. . . . He was very much  afraid of full-grown sheep, cows and horses, but he loved colts,  calves and lambs, proving to us that he recognized youth.    WOODS VS. FIELDS. \"We found he did not like fields or open  country, but he was very happy in a garden, or in woods. . . . He  always liked nibbling twigs, and to eat the green buds of trees.    TABLE MANNERS. \"His table manners were really very good. He always  sat at the table, and whenever a meal was ready, would pull his  own chair up to his place. He did not care to eat a great deal,  but he especially liked to drink water out of a tumbler. . . . He  was the least greedy of all the animals I have ever seen. He never  would snatch anything, and always ate very slowly. He always drank  a lot of water, which he would always get himself whenever he  wanted it by turning on a tap. Strange to say, he always turned  off the water when he had finished drinking.    PLAYING TO THE GALLERY. \"John seemed to think that everyone was  delighted to see him, and he would throw up the window whenever he  was permitted. If he found the sash locked he would unfasten it,  and when a big crowd had collected outside he would clap his chest  and his hands. [Footnote: In the summer of 1920 a globe-trotter  just arrived from England excitedly reported to me: \"While driving  along a street in London _I saw a live gorilla_ in the upper  window of an apartment. It was a _real gorilla;_ and it  clapped its hands at us as we looked! Now _what_ did it all  mean?\" Fortunately I was able to explain it.]    PUNISHMENT AND REPENTANCE. \"We made one very great mistake with  John. His cage was used as a punishment, with the result that we  never could leave him there alone, for he would shriek all the  time. . . . Now, a stick was the one thing that our gorilla would  not stand from anyone, save Major Penny and myself. Presently we  found out that the only way to deal with him was to tell him that  he was very naughty, and push him away from us; when he would roll  on the floor and cry, and be very-repentant, holding one's ankles,  and putting his head on our feet.    AFFECTION FOR A CHILD. \"He was especially fond of my little niece,  three years old. John and she used to play together for hours, and  he seemed to understand what she wanted him to do. If she ever  cried, and her mother would not go and pick her up, John would  always try and nip the mother, or give her a smack with the full  weight of his hand, evidently thinking she was the cause of the  child's tears.    A SENSE OF GOOD ORDER. \"He loved to take everything  out of a wastepaper basket and strew the contents all over the  room, after which, when told to do so he would pick up everything  and put it all back, but looking very bored all the while. If the basket  was very full he would push it all down very carefully, to make room  for more. He would always put things back when told to do so, such  as books from a bookshelf or things from a table.
