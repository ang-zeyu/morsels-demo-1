Deeply attached to Miss Moon, he suffered  from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak.\"    I nodded.    \"I remember. Yes, I recall the Sipperley case. He couldn't bring himself  to the scratch. A marked coldness of the feet, was there not? I recollect  you saying he was letting--what was it?--letting something do something.  Cats entered into it, if I am not mistaken.\"    \"Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would', sir.\"    \"That's right. But how about the cats?\"    \"Like the poor cat i' the adage, sir.\"    \"Exactly. It beats me how you think up these things. And Gussie, you say,  is in the same posish?\"    \"Yes, sir. Each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage,  his courage fails him.\"    \"And yet, if he wants this female to be his wife, he's got to say so,  what? I mean, only civil to mention it.\"    \"Precisely, sir.\"    I mused.    \"Well, I suppose this was inevitable, Jeeves. I wouldn't have thought  that this Fink-Nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine _p_,  but, if he has, no wonder he finds the going sticky.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Look at the life he's led.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I don't suppose he has spoken to a girl for years. What a lesson this is  to us, Jeeves, not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into  glass tanks. You can't be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing.  In this life, you can choose between two courses. You can either shut  yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks, or you can be a  dasher with the sex. You can't do both.\"    \"No, sir.\"    I mused once more. Gussie and I, as I say, had rather lost touch, but all  the same I was exercised about the poor fish, as I am about all my pals,  close or distant, who find themselves treading upon Life's banana skins.  It seemed to me that he was up against it.    I threw my mind back to the last time I had seen him. About two years  ago, it had been. I had looked in at his place while on a motor trip, and  he had put me right off my feed by bringing a couple of green things with  legs to the luncheon table, crooning over them like a young mother and  eventually losing one of them in the salad. That picture, rising before  my eyes, didn't give me much confidence in the unfortunate goof's ability  to woo and win, I must say. Especially if the girl he had earmarked was  one of these tough modern thugs, all lipstick and cool, hard, sardonic  eyes, as she probably was.    \"Tell me, Jeeves,\" I said, wishing to know the worst, \"what sort of a  girl is this girl of Gussie's?\"    \"I have not met the young lady, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle speaks highly of her  attractions.\"    \"Seemed to like her, did he?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Did he mention her name? Perhaps I know her.\"    \"She is a Miss Bassett, sir. Miss Madeline Bassett.\"    \"What?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    I was deeply intrigued.    \"Egad, Jeeves! Fancy that. It's a small world, isn't it, what?\"    \"The young lady is an acquaintance of yours, sir?\"    \"I know her well. Your news has relieved my mind, Jeeves. It makes the  whole thing begin to seem far more like a practical working proposition.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"Absolutely. I confess that until you supplied this information I was  feeling profoundly dubious about poor old Gussie's chances of inducing  any spinster of any parish to join him in the saunter down the aisle. You  will agree with me that he is not everybody's money.\"    \"There may be something in what you say, sir.\"    \"Cleopatra wouldn't have liked him.\"    \"Possibly not, sir.\"    \"And I doubt if he would go any too well with Tallulah Bankhead.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"But when you tell me that the object of his affections is Miss Bassett,  why, then, Jeeves, hope begins to dawn a bit. He's just the sort of chap  a girl like Madeline Bassett might scoop in with relish.\"    This Bassett, I must explain, had been a fellow visitor of ours at  Cannes; and as she and Angela had struck up one of those effervescent  friendships which girls do strike up, I had seen quite a bit of her.  Indeed, in my moodier moments it sometimes seemed to me that I could not  move a step without stubbing my toe on the woman.    And what made it all so painful and distressing was that the more we met,  the less did I seem able to find to say to her.    You know how it is with some girls. They seem to take the stuffing right  out of you. I mean to say, there is something about their personality  that paralyses the vocal cords and reduces the contents of the brain to  cauliflower. It was like that with this Bassett and me; so much so that I  have known occasions when for minutes at a stretch Bertram Wooster might  have been observed fumbling with the tie, shuffling the feet, and  behaving in all other respects in her presence like the complete dumb  brick. When, therefore, she took her departure some two weeks before we  did, you may readily imagine that, in Bertram's opinion, it was not a day  too soon.    It was not her beauty, mark you, that thus numbed me. She was a pretty  enough girl in a droopy, blonde, saucer-eyed way, but not the sort of  breath-taker that takes the breath.    No, what caused this disintegration in a usually fairly fluent prattler  with the sex was her whole mental attitude. I don't want to wrong  anybody, so I won't go so far as to say that she actually wrote poetry,  but her conversation, to my mind, was of a nature calculated to excite  the liveliest suspicions. Well, I mean to say, when a girl suddenly asks  you out of a blue sky if you don't sometimes feel that the stars are  God's daisy-chain, you begin to think a bit.    As regards the fusing of her soul and mine, therefore, there was nothing  doing. But with Gussie, the posish was entirely different. The thing that  had stymied me--viz. that this girl was obviously all loaded down with  ideals and sentiment and what not--was quite in order as far as he was  concerned.    Gussie had always been one of those dreamy, soulful birds--you can't shut  yourself up in the country and live only for newts, if you're not--and I  could see no reason why, if he could somehow be induced to get the low,  burning words off his chest, he and the Bassett shouldn't hit it off like  ham and eggs.    \"She's just the type for him,\" I said.    \"I am most gratified to hear it, sir.\"    \"And he's just the type for her. In fine, a good thing and one to be  pushed along with the utmost energy. Strain every nerve, Jeeves.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" replied the honest fellow. \"I will attend to the matter  at once.\"    Now up to this point, as you will doubtless agree, what you might call a  perfect harmony had prevailed. Friendly gossip between employer and  employed, and everything as sweet as a nut. But at this juncture, I  regret to say, there was an unpleasant switch. The atmosphere suddenly  changed, the storm clouds began to gather, and before we knew where we  were, the jarring note had come bounding on the scene. I have known this  to happen before in the Wooster home.    The first intimation I had that things were about to hot up was a pained  and disapproving cough from the neighbourhood of the carpet. For, during  the above exchanges, I should explain, while I, having dried the frame,  had been dressing in a leisurely manner, donning here a sock, there a  shoe, and gradually climbing into the vest, the shirt, the tie, and the  knee-length, Jeeves had been down on the lower level, unpacking my  effects.    He now rose, holding a white object. And at the sight of it, I realized  that another of our domestic crises had arrived, another of those  unfortunate clashes of will between two strong men, and that Bertram,  unless he remembered his fighting ancestors and stood up for his rights,  was about to be put upon.    I don't know if you were at Cannes this summer. If you were, you will  recall that anybody with any pretensions to being the life and soul of  the party was accustomed to attend binges at the Casino in the ordinary  evening-wear trouserings topped to the north by a white mess-jacket with  brass buttons. And ever since I had stepped aboard the Blue Train at  Cannes station, I had been wondering on and off how mine would go with  Jeeves.    In the matter of evening costume, you see, Jeeves is hidebound and  reactionary. I had had trouble with him before about soft-bosomed shirts.  And while these mess-jackets had, as I say, been all the rage--_tout ce  qu'il y a de chic_--on the Cote d'Azur, I had never concealed it from  myself, even when treading the measure at the Palm Beach Casino in the  one I had hastened to buy, that there might be something of an upheaval  about it on my return.    I prepared to be firm.    \"Yes, Jeeves?\" I said. And though my voice was suave, a close observer in  a position to watch my eyes would have noticed a steely glint. Nobody has  a greater respect for Jeeves's intellect than I have, but this  disposition of his to dictate to the hand that fed him had got, I felt,  to be checked. This mess-jacket was very near to my heart, and I jolly  well intended to fight for it with all the vim of grand old Sieur de  Wooster at the Battle of Agincourt.    \"Yes, Jeeves?\" I said. \"Something on your mind, Jeeves?\"    \"I fear that you inadvertently left Cannes in the possession of a coat  belonging to some other gentleman, sir.\"    I switched on the steely a bit more.    \"No, Jeeves,\" I said, in a level tone, \"the object under advisement is  mine. I bought it out there.\"    \"You wore it, sir?\"    \"Every night.\"    \"But surely you are not proposing to wear it in England, sir?\"    I saw that we had arrived at the nub.    \"Yes, Jeeves.\"    \"But, sir----\"    \"You were saying, Jeeves?\"    \"It is quite unsuitable, sir.\"    \"I do not agree with you, Jeeves. I anticipate a great popular success  for this jacket. It is my intention to spring it on the public tomorrow  at Pongo Twistleton's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#2)"],[1,"to him, however, the first of  these letters was written when Smethurst, alias Barker, had spent all  the money he had obtained from the crime, and found himself destitute in  New York.    \"Kershaw, then in fairly prosperous circumstances, sent him a L10 note  for the sake of old times. The second, when the tables had turned, and  Kershaw had begun to go downhill, Smethurst, as he then already called  himself, sent his whilom friend L50. After that, as Mueller gathered,  Kershaw had made sundry demands on Smethurst's ever-increasing purse,  and had accompanied these demands by various threats, which, considering  the distant country in which the millionaire lived, were worse than  futile.    \"But now the climax had come, and Kershaw, after a final moment of  hesitation, handed over to his German friend the two last letters  purporting to have been written by Smethurst, and which, if you  remember, played such an important part in the mysterious story of this  extraordinary crime. I have a copy of both these letters here,\" added  the man in the corner, as he took out a piece of paper from a very  worn-out pocket-book, and, unfolding it very deliberately, he began to  read:--    \"'Sir,--Your preposterous demands for money are wholly unwarrantable. I  have already helped you quite as much as you deserve. However, for the  sake of old times, and because you once helped me when I was in a  terrible difficulty, I am willing to once more let you impose upon my  good nature. A friend of mine here, a Russian merchant, to whom I have  sold my business, starts in a few days for an extended tour to many  European and Asiatic ports in his yacht, and has invited me to accompany  him as far as England. Being tired of foreign parts, and desirous of  seeing the old country once again after thirty years' absence, I have  decided to accept his invitation. I don't know when we may actually be  in Europe, but I promise you that as soon as we touch a suitable port I  will write to you again, making an appointment for you to see me in  London. But remember that if your demands are too preposterous I will  not for a moment listen to them, and that I am the last man in the world  to submit to persistent and unwarrantable blackmail.      'I am, sir,        'Yours truly,            'Francis Smethurst.'    \"The second letter was dated from Southampton,\" continued the old man in  the corner calmly, \"and, curiously enough, was the only letter which  Kershaw professed to have received from Smethurst of which he had kept  the envelope, and which was dated. It was quite brief,\" he added,  referring once more to his piece of paper.    \"'Dear Sir,--Referring to my letter of a few weeks ago, I wish to inform  you that the _Tsarskoe Selo_ will touch at Tilbury on Tuesday next, the  10th. I shall land there, and immediately go up to London by the first  train I can get. If you like, you may meet me at Fenchurch Street  Station, in the first-class waiting-room, in the late afternoon. Since I  surmise that after thirty years' absence my face may not be familiar to  you, I may as well tell you that you will recognize me by a heavy  Astrakhan fur coat, which I shall wear, together with a cap of the same.  You may then introduce yourself to me, and I will personally listen to  what you may have to say.        'Yours faithfully,          'Francis Smethurst.'    \"It was this last letter which had caused William Kershaw's excitement  and his wife's tears. In the German's own words, he was walking up and  down the room like a wild beast, gesticulating wildly, and muttering  sundry exclamations. Mrs. Kershaw, however, was full of apprehension.  She mistrusted the man from foreign parts--who, according to her  husband's story, had already one crime upon his conscience--who might,  she feared, risk another, in order to be rid of a dangerous enemy.  Woman-like, she thought the scheme a dishonourable one, for the law, she  knew, is severe on the blackmailer.    \"The assignation might be a cunning trap, in any case it was a curious  one; why, she argued, did not Smethurst elect to see Kershaw at his  hotel the following day? A thousand whys and wherefores made her  anxious, but the fat German had been won over by Kershaw's visions of  untold gold, held tantalisingly before his eyes. He had lent the  necessary L2, with which his friend intended to tidy himself up a bit  before he went to meet his friend the millionaire. Half an hour  afterwards Kershaw had left his lodgings, and that was the last the  unfortunate woman saw of her husband, or Mueller, the German, of his  friend.    \"Anxiously his wife waited that night, but he did not return; the next  day she seems to have spent in making purposeless and futile inquiries  about the neighbourhood of Fenchurch Street; and on the 12th she went to  Scotland Yard, gave what particulars she knew, and placed in the hands  of the police the two letters written by Smethurst.\"          CHAPTER II    A MILLIONAIRE IN THE DOCK      The man in the corner had finished his glass of milk. His watery blue  eyes looked across at Miss Polly Burton's eager little face, from which  all traces of severity had now been chased away by an obvious and  intense excitement.    \"It was only on the 31st,\" he resumed after a while, \"that a body,  decomposed past all recognition, was found by two lightermen in the  bottom of a disused barge. She had been moored at one time at the foot  of one of those dark flights of steps which lead down between tall  warehouses to the river in the East End of London. I have a photograph  of the place here,\" he added, selecting one out of his pocket, and  placing it before Polly.    \"The actual barge, you see, had already been removed when I took this  snapshot, but you will realize what a perfect place this alley is for  the purpose of one man cutting another's throat in comfort, and without  fear of detection. The body, as I said, was decomposed beyond all  recognition; it had probably been there eleven days, but sundry  articles, such as a silver ring and a tie pin, were recognizable, and  were identified by Mrs. Kershaw as belonging to her husband.    \"She, of course, was loud in denouncing Smethurst, and the police had no  doubt a very strong case against him, for two days after the discovery  of the body in the barge, the Siberian millionaire, as he was already  popularly called by enterprising interviewers, was arrested in his  luxurious suite of rooms at the Hotel Cecil.    \"To confess the truth, at this point I was not a little puzzled. Mrs.  Kershaw's story and Smethurst's letters had both found their way into  the papers, and following my usual method--mind you, I am only an  amateur, I try to reason out a case for the love of the thing--I sought  about for a motive for the crime, which the police declared Smethurst  had committed. To effectually get rid of a dangerous blackmailer was the  generally accepted theory. Well! did it ever strike you how paltry that  motive really was?\"    Miss Polly had to confess, however, that it had never struck her in that  light.    \"Surely a man who had succeeded in building up an immense fortune by his  own individual efforts, was not the sort of fool to believe that he had  anything to fear from a man like Kershaw. He must have _known_ that  Kershaw held no damning proofs against him--not enough to hang him,  anyway. Have you ever seen Smethurst?\" he added, as he once more fumbled  in his pocket-book.    Polly replied that she had seen Smethurst's picture in the illustrated  papers at the time. Then he added, placing a small photograph before  her:    \"What strikes you most about the face?\"    \"Well, I think its strange, astonished expression, due to the total  absence of eyebrows, and the funny foreign cut of the hair.\"    \"So close that it almost looks as if it had been shaved. Exactly. That  is what struck me most when I elbowed my way into the court that morning  and first caught sight of the millionaire in the dock. He was a tall,  soldierly-looking man, upright in stature, his face very bronzed and  tanned. He wore neither moustache nor beard, his hair was cropped quite  close to his head, like a Frenchman's; but, of course, what was so very  remarkable about him was that total absence of eyebrows and even  eyelashes, which gave the face such a peculiar appearance--as you say, a  perpetually astonished look.    \"He seemed, however, wonderfully calm; he had been accommodated with a  chair in the dock--being a millionaire--and chatted pleasantly with his  lawyer, Sir Arthur Inglewood, in the intervals between the calling of  the several witnesses for the prosecution; whilst during the examination  of these witnesses he sat quite placidly, with his head shaded by his  hand.    \"Mueller and Mrs. Kershaw repeated the story which they had already told  to the police. I think you said that you were not able, owing to  pressure of work, to go to the court that day, and hear the case, so  perhaps you have no recollection of Mrs. Kershaw. No? Ah, well! Here is  a snapshot I managed to get of her once. That is her. Exactly as she  stood in the box--over-dressed--in elaborate crape, with a bonnet which  once had contained pink roses, and to which a remnant of pink petals  still clung obtrusively amidst the deep black.    \"She would not look at the prisoner, and turned her head resolutely  towards the magistrate. I fancy she had been fond of that vagabond  husband of hers: an enormous wedding-ring encircled her finger, and  that, too, was swathed in black. She firmly believed that Kershaw's  murderer sat there in the dock, and she literally flaunted her grief  before him.    \"I was indescribably sorry for her. As for Mueller, he was just fat,  oily, pompous, conscious of his own importance as a witness; his fat  fingers, covered with brass rings, gripped the two incriminating  letters, which he had identified. They were his passports, as it were,  to a"]]]
