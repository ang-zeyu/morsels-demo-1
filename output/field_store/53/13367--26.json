The pudding being broke to pieces by the  fall, Tom crept out covered all over with the batter, and walked home.  His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful  state, put him into a teacup, and soon washed off the batter; after  which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.    Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk her  cow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was very  high, for fear of being blown away, she tied him to a thistle with a  piece of fine thread. The cow soon observed Tom's oak-leaf hat, and  liking the appearance of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one  mouthful. While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her  great teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared out  as loud as he could: \"Mother, mother!\"    \"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?\" said his mother.    \"Here, mother,\" replied he, \"in the red cow's mouth.\"    His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised  at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.  Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the  ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in her  bosom and ran home with him.    Tom's father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle with,  and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and rolled  into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him up, and flew  with him over the sea, and there dropped him.    A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was  soon after caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they  opened the fish in order to cook it, every one was astonished at finding  such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted at being free again.  They carried him to the king, who made Tom his dwarf, and he soon grew  a great favourite at court; for by his tricks and gambols he not only  amused the king and queen, but also all the Knights of the Round Table.    It is said that when the king rode out on horseback, he often took  Tom along with him, and if a shower came on, he used to creep into his  majesty's waistcoat-pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.    King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if they  were as small as he was, and whether they were well off. Tom told the  king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the court,  but in rather poor circumstances. On hearing this, the king carried Tom  to his treasury, the place where he kept all his money, and told him to  take as much money as he could carry home to his parents, which made  the poor little fellow caper with joy. Tom went immediately to procure  a purse, which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the  treasury, where he received a silver threepenny-piece to put into it.    Our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his  back; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and set  forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any accident, and  after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days  and two nights he reached his father's house in safety.    Tom had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his  back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet  him, and carried him into the house. But he soon returned to Court.    As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the batter-pudding, and the inside  of the fish, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to be  mounted as a knight on a mouse.      Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,      His boots of chicken's hide;    And by a nimble fairy blade,    Well learned in the tailoring trade,      His clothing was supplied.    A needle dangled by his side;    A dapper mouse he used to ride,    Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!    It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress and mounted on  the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and nobility, who were  all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancing charger.    The king was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little chair  to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also a  palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in. He  also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.    The queen was so enraged at the honours conferred on Sir Thomas that she  resolved to ruin him, and told the king that the little knight had been  saucy to her.    The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the  danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he lay  for a long time until he was almost starved with hunger; but at last he  ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground,  near the place of his concealment, he got close to it and jumping  astride on it, was carried up into the air. The butterfly flew with him  from tree to tree and from field to field, and at last returned to the  court, where the king and nobility all strove to catch him; but at last  poor Tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in which he was almost  drowned.    When the queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be  beheaded; and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of his  execution.    However a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about  till the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.    The king received Tom again into favour, which he did not live to enjoy,  for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew his sword  and fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last overcame him.      He fell dead on the ground where he stood,    And the spider suck'd every drop of his blood.    King Arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their  little favourite that they went into mourning and raised a fine white  marble monument over his grave with the following epitaph:      Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,    Who died by a spider's cruel bite.    He was well known in Arthur's court,    Where he afforded gallant sport;    He rode at tilt and tournament,    And on a mouse a-hunting went.    Alive he filled the court with mirth;    His death to sorrow soon gave birth.    Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head    And cry,--Alas! Tom Thumb is dead!          MR. FOX    Lady Mary was young, and Lady Mary was fair. She had two brothers, and  more lovers than she could count. But of them all, the bravest and most  gallant, was a Mr. Fox, whom she met when she was down at her father's  country-house. No one knew who Mr. Fox was; but he was certainly brave,  and surely rich, and of all her lovers, Lady Mary cared for him alone.  At last it was agreed upon between them that they should be married.  Lady Mary asked Mr. Fox where they should live, and he described to her  his castle, and where it was; but, strange to say, did not ask her, or  her brothers to come and see it.    So one day, near the wedding-day, when her brothers were out, and Mr.  Fox was away for a day or two on business, as he said, Lady Mary set out  for Mr. Fox's castle. And after many searchings, she came at last to  it, and a fine strong house it was, with high walls and a deep moat. And  when she came up to the gateway she saw written on it:    BE BOLD, BE BOLD.    But as the gate was open, she went through it, and found no one there.  So she went up to the doorway, and over it she found written:    BE BOLD, BE BOLD, BUT NOT TOO BOLD.    Still she went on, till she came into the hall, and went up the broad  stairs till she came to a door in the gallery, over which was written:    BE BOLD, BE BOLD, BUT NOT TOO BOLD, LEST THAT YOUR HEART'S BLOOD SHOULD  RUN COLD.    But Lady Mary was a brave one, she was, and she opened the door, and  what do you think she saw? Why, bodies and skeletons of beautiful young  ladies all stained with blood. So Lady Mary thought it was high time to  get out of that horrid place, and she closed the door, went through the  gallery, and was just going down the stairs, and out of the hall, when  who should she see through the window, but Mr. Fox dragging a beautiful  young lady along from the gateway to the door. Lady Mary rushed  downstairs, and hid herself behind a cask, just in time, as Mr. Fox came  in with the poor young lady who seemed to have fainted. Just as he got  near Lady Mary, Mr. Fox saw a diamond ring glittering on the finger of  the young lady he was dragging, and he tried to pull it off. But it was  tightly fixed, and would not come off, so Mr. Fox cursed and swore, and  drew his sword, raised it, and brought it down upon the hand of the poor  lady. The sword cut off the hand, which jumped up into the air, and fell  of all places in the world into Lady Mary's lap. Mr. Fox looked about a  bit, but did not think of looking behind the cask, so at last he went on  dragging the young lady up the stairs into the Bloody Chamber.    As soon as she heard him pass through the gallery, Lady Mary crept  out of the door, down through the gateway, and ran home as fast as she  could.    Now it happened that the very next day the marriage contract of Lady  Mary and Mr. Fox was to be signed, and there was a splendid breakfast  before that. And when Mr. Fox was seated at table opposite Lady Mary,  he looked at her. \"How pale you are this morning, my dear.\" \"Yes,\"  said she, \"I had a bad night's rest last night. I had horrible dreams.\"  \"Dreams go by contraries,\" said Mr. Fox; \"but tell us your dream, and  your sweet voice will make the time pass till the happy hour comes.\"    \"I dreamed,\" said Lady Mary, \"that I went yestermorn to your castle, and  I found it in the woods, with high walls, and a deep moat, and over the  gateway was written:    BE BOLD, BE BOLD.    \"But it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#19)"],[1,"converted, gained several proselytes, particularly Osaid Ebn Hodeira,  a chief man of the city, and Saad Ebn Moâdh, prince of the tribe of Aws;  Mohammedism spreading so fast, that there was scarce a house wherein there  were not some who had embraced it.     The next year, being the thirteenth of Mohammed's mission, Masáh returned  to Mecca, accompanied by seventy-three men and two women of Medina, who had  professed Islamism, besides some others who were as yet unbelievers.  On their  arrival, they immediately sent to Mohammed, and offered him their assistance,  of which he was now in great need, for his adversaries were by this time grown  so powerful in Mecca, that he could not stay there much longer without  imminent danger.  Wherefore he accepted their proposal, and met them one  night, by appointment, at al Akaba above mentioned, attended by his uncle al  Abbas, who, though he was not then a believer, wished his nephew well, and  made a speech to those of Medina, wherein he told them, that as Mohammed was  obliged to quit his native city, and seek an asylum elsewhere, and they had  offered him their protection, they would do well not to deceive him; and that  if they were not firmly resolved to defend and not betray him, they had better  declare their minds, and let him provide for his safety in some other manner.  Upon their protesting their sincerity, Mohammed swore to be faithful to them,  on condition that they should protect him against all insults, as heartily as  they would their own wives and families.  They then asked him what recompense  they were to expect if they should happen to be killed in his quarrel; he  answered, Paradise.  Whereupon they pledged their faith to him, and so  returned home;3 after Mohammed had chosen twelve out of their number, who were  to have the same authority among them as the twelve apostles of Christ had  among his disciples.4     Hitherto Mohammed had propagated his religion by fair means, so that the  whole success of his enterprise, before his flight to Medina, must be  attributed to persuasion only, and not to compulsion.  For before this second  oath of fealty or inauguration at al Akaba, he had no permission to use any  force at all; and in several places of the Korân, which he pretended were  revealed during his stay at Mecca,       1  Cap. 60.  2  Vide Kor. c. 6.  3  Abulfeda.  Vit.  Moham. p. 40, &c.  4  Ebn Ishâk.          he declares his business was only to preach and admonish; that he had no  authority to compel any person to embrace his religion; and that whether  people believed, or not, was none of his concern, but belonged solely unto  GOD.  And he was so far from allowing his followers to use force, that he  exhorted them to bear patiently those injuries which were offered them on  account of their faith; and when persecuted himself, chose rather to quit the  place of his birth and retire to Medina, than to make any resistance.  But  this great passiveness and moderation seems entirely owing to his want of  power, and the great superiority of his opposers for the first twelve years of  his mission; for no sooner was he enabled, by the assistance of those of  Medina, to make head against his enemies, than he gave out, that GOD had  allowed him and his followers to defend themselves against the infidels; and  at length as his forces increased, he pretended to have the divine leave even  to attack them, and to destroy idolatry, and set up the true faith by the  sword; finding by experience that his designs would otherwise proceed very  slowly, if they were not utterly overthrown, and knowing on the other hand  that innovators, when they depend solely on their own strength, and can  compel, seldom run any risk; from whence, the politician observes, it follows,  that all the armed prophets have succeeded, and the unarmed ones have failed.  Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus would not have been able to establish the  observance of their institutions for any length of time had they not been  armed.1  The first passage of the Korân which gave Mohammed the permission of  defending himself by arms, is said to have been that in the twenty-second  chapter; after which a great number to the same purpose were revealed.     That Mohammed had a right to take up arms for his own defence against his  unjust persecutors, may perhaps be allowed; but whether he ought afterwards to  have made use of that means for the establishing of his religion is a question  I will not here determine.  How far the secular power may or ought to  interpose in affairs of this nature, mankind are not agreed.  The method of  converting by the sword, gives no very favourable idea of the faith which is  so propagated, and is disallowed by everybody in those of another religion,  though the same persons are willing to admit of it for the advancement of  their own; supposing that though a false religion ought not to be established  by authority, yet a true one may; and accordingly force is almost as  constantly employed in these cases by those who have the power in their hands,  as it is constantly complained of by those who suffer the violence.  It is  certainly one of the most convincing proofs that Mohammedism was no other than  human invention, that it owed its progress and establishment almost entirely  to the sword; and it is one of the strongest demonstrations of the divine  original of Christianity, that it prevailed against all the forces and powers  of the world by the mere dint of its own truth, after having stood the  assaults of all manner of persecutions, as well as other oppositions, for 300  years together and at length made the Roman emperors themselves submit  thereto;2 after which time, indeed, this proof seems to fail, Christianity  being        1  Machiavelli, Princ. c. 6.   2  See Prideaux's Letter  to the Deists, p. 220, &c.          then established and Paganism abolished by public authority, which has had  great influence in the propagation of the one and destruction of the other  ever since.1  But to return.     Mohammed having provided for the security of his companions as well as his  own, by the league offensive and defensive which he had now concluded with  those of Medina, directed them to repair thither, which they accordingly did;  but himself with Abu Becr and Ali stayed behind, having not yet received the  divine permission, as he pretended, to leave Mecca.  The Koreish, fearing the  consequence of this new alliance, began to think it absolutely necessary to  prevent Mohammed's escape to Medina, and having held a council thereon, after  several milder expedients had been rejected, they came to a resolution that he  should be killed; and agreed that a man should be chosen out of every tribe  for the execution of this design, and that each man should have a blow at him  with his sword, that the guilt of his blood might fall equally on all the  tribes, to whose united power the Hashemites were much inferior, and therefore  durst not attempt to revenge their kinsman's death.     This conspiracy was scarce formed when by some means or other it came to  Mohammed knowledge, and he gave out that it was revealed to him the angel  Gabriel, who had now ordered him to retire to Medina.  Whereupon, to amuse his  enemies, he directed Ali to lie down in his place and wrap himself up in his  green cloak, which he did, and Mohammed escape miraculously, as they pretend,2  to Abu Becr's house, unperceived by the conspirators, who had already  assembled at the prophet's door.  They in the meantime, looking through the  crevice and seeing Ali, whom they took to be Mohammed himself, asleep,  continued watching there till morning, when Ali arose, and they found  themselves deceived.     From Abu Becr's house Mohammed and he went to a cave in Mount Thur, to the  south-east of Mecca, accompanied only by Amer Ebn Foheirah, Abu Becr's  servant, and Abd'allah Ebn Oreikat, an idolater, whom they had hired for a  guide.  In this cave they lay hid three days to avoid the search of their  enemies, which they very narrowly escaped, and not without the assistance of  more miracles than one; for some say that the Koreish were struck with  blindness, so that they could not find the cave; others, that after Mohammed  and his companions were got in, two pigeons laid their eggs at the entrance,  and a spider covered the mouth of the cave with her web,3 which made them look  no farther.4  Abu Becr, seeing the prophet in such imminent danger, became  very sorrowful, whereupon Mohammed comforted him with these words, recorded in  the Korân:5 \"Be not grieved, for GOD is with us.\"  Their enemies being  retired, they left the cave and set out for Medina, by a by-road, and having  fortunately, or as the Mohammedans tell us, miraculously, escaped some who  were sent to pursue them,       1  See Bayle's Dict. Hist. Art. Mahomet, Rem. O.  2  See the notes  to chap. 8 and 36.   3  It is observable that the Jews have a  like tradition concerning David, when he fled from Saul into the cave; and the  Targum paraphrases these words of the second verse of Psalm lvii., which was  composed on occasion of that deliverance: \"I will pray before the most high  GOD that performeth all things for me, in this manner; I will pray before the  most high GOD, who called a spider to weave a web for my sake in the mouth of  the cave.\"   4  Al Beidâwi in Kor. c. 9.  Vide D'Herbel. Bibl.  Orient p. 445.  5  Cap. 9.        arrived safely at that city; whither Ali followed them in three days, after he  had settled some affairs at Mecca.4     The first thing Mohammed did after his arrival at Medina, was to build a  temple for his religious worship, and a house for himself, which he did on a  parcel of ground which had before served to put camels in, or as others tell  us, for a burying-ground, and belonged to Sahal and Soheil the sons of Amru,  who were orphans.5  This action Dr. Prideaux exclaims against, representing it "]]]
