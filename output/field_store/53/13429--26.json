[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#19)"],[1,"  This declaration was endorsed by the representatives of Great Britain,  France and Italy at Versailles on June 3, 1918. On June 29, Mr. Lansing  completed and explained his statement as follows:        \"Since the issuance by this government on May 29 of a statement      regarding the nationalist aspirations for freedom of the Czecho-Slovaks      and Jugoslavs, German and Austrian officials have sought to      misinterpret and distort its manifest interpretation. In order,      therefore, that there may be no misunderstanding concerning the meaning      of this statement, the Secretary of State to-day further announces the      position of the United States Government to be that _all branches of      the Slav race should be completely freed from German and Austrian      rule_.\"    On the following day, that is on June 30, 1918, President Poincare  presented the Czecho-Slovak army with a flag and delivered an inspiring  speech to them.    On the occasion of the handing of this flag by President Pioncare to the  Czecho-Slovak army, M. Pichon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf  of the government of the French Republic, addressed the following letter to  Dr. Edouard Benes, the general secretary of the Czecho-Slovak National  Council in Paris:        \"At the moment when the 21st Regiment of Chasseurs, the first unit of      the autonomous Czecho-Slovak army in France, after receiving its flag,      is leaving its quarters to take up its position in a sector amongst its      French brothers-in-arms, the Republican Government, in recognition of      your efforts and your attachment to the Allied cause, considers it just      and necessary to proclaim _the right of your nation to its independence      and to recognise publicly and officially the National Council as the      supreme organ of its general interests and the first step towards a      future Czecho-Slovak Government_.        \"During many centuries the Czecho-Slovak nation has enjoyed the      incomparable benefit of independence. It has been deprived of this      independence through the violence of the Habsburgs allied to the German      princes. The historic rights of nations are imperishable. It is for the      defence of these rights that France, attacked, is fighting to-day      together with her Allies. The cause of the Czechs is especially dear to      her.        \"France will never forget the Prague manifestation of December 8, 1870.      Neither will she forget the resistance of its population and the      refusal of Czech soldiers to fight for Austria-Hungary, for which      heroism thousands of these patriots paid with their lives. France has      also heard the appeals of the Czech deputies of January 6, April 13,      and May 16, 1918.        \"Faithful to the principles of respect for nationalities and the      liberation of oppressed nations, _the Government of the Republic      considers the claims of the Czecho-Slovak nation as just and well      founded, and will, at the right moment, support with all its solicitude      the realisation of your aspirations to independence within the historic      boundaries of your territories_ at present suffering under the      oppressive yoke of Austria and Hungary.        \"It is very pleasant for me, Monsieur le Secretaire General, to make      this declaration. Your sentiments, reflecting those of your      compatriots, are for me the measure of the high degree of the future      happiness of your country.        \"In the name of the Government of the French Republic I tender _my      warmest and most sincere wishes that the Czecho-Slovak State may      speedily become, through the common efforts of all the Allies and in      close union with Poland and the Jugoslav State, an insurmountable      barrier to Teutonic aggression_ and a factor for peace in a      reconstituted Europe in accordance with the principles of justice and      rights of nationalities.\"    It is unnecessary to add long comments to this clear and explicit state  paper which forms a veritable pledge on the part of France to secure  Czecho-Slovak independence. It is a recognition of Bohemia's right to  independence and of the National Council as the supreme organ of the  Czecho-Slovak nation abroad. At the same time it is also an acceptance of  our programme of the reorganisation of Central Europe, necessitating the  break-up of Austria, and in this respect it is also a success and a pledge  for the Poles and Yugoslavs.    6. If France and Italy showed such deep understanding of the cause of  Bohemia's liberty, exhibited in practice by special military conventions  concluded with our National Council, Great Britain may be proud of no less  generosity. Although having no direct interests in seeing Bohemia  independent, Great Britain, true to her traditions as a champion of the  liberties of small nations, did not hesitate to give us a declaration which  not only fully endorses all pledges of France and Italy, but which goes  still further and practically recognises our full national sovereignty.    On August 9, 1918, His Majesty's Government issued the following  declaration:        \"Since the beginning of the war the Czecho-Slovak nation has resisted      the common enemy by every means in its power. The Czecho-Slovaks have      constituted a considerable army, fighting on three different      battlefields and attempting, in Russia and Siberia, to arrest the      Germanic invasion.        \"_In consideration of their efforts to achieve independence, Great      Britain regards the Czecho-Slovaks as an Allied nation and recognises      the unity of the three Czecho-Slovak armies as an Allied and      belligerent army waging a regular warfare against Austria-Hungary and      Germany_.        \"Great Britain also recognises _the right of the Czecho-Slovak National      Council as the supreme organ of the Czecho-Slovak national interests,      and as the present trustee of the future Czecho-Slovak Government to      exercise supreme authority over this Allied and belligerent army_.\"    It will be readily seen of what a tremendous significance this declaration  is from an international point of view. Apart from the fact that it  recognises our efforts towards independence, the declaration says  explicitly that the Czecho-Slovaks, abroad and at home, are an Allied  nation, which implies that the Allies will treat them henceforward as such,  and will allow their government to establish consular service and to send  representatives to Allied conferences. The sovereignty both of the  Czecho-Slovak army and of the National Council is fully recognised in this  declaration which proclaims \"the unity of the three Czecho-Slovak armies  (in Russia, France and Italy) as an _Allied and belligerent army_ waging  _regular warfare_ against Austria.\" Only a sovereign army is a belligerent  army waging regular warfare. Thus the Czecho-Slovaks, according to  international law, are no more rebels but regular soldiers whom, when  captured, Austria has no more the right to execute. Similarly also the  recognition of the National Council as the \"trustee\" of the Czecho-Slovak  Government is clear and explicit; in fact a \"trustee\" is the word applied  to a provisional government of a state. As a matter of fact, the National  Council, on the ground of this recognition of full sovereignty, was  constituted as a Provisional Government on October 14, 1918, and has the  power to exercise all rights appertaining to a sovereign and independent  government.    Thus implicitly Great Britain considers Czecho-Slovak independence already  a _fait accompli_. It speaks of and considers a Czecho-Slovak State no more  as a probability, but as a certainty. As with the Czecho-Slovaks so with  Great Britain, Austria exists no more.    The recognition is of additional importance because it comes from Great  Britain who has always been considered a traditional friend of Austria, and  who is known for conservatism in foreign politics. The decision to issue a  declaration of such far-reaching importance was surely arrived at only  after due and careful deliberation. The step which Great Britain has taken  thereby once more proves the deep sense of justice and the far-sightedness  of British statesmen. Needless to say that the Czecho-Slovaks will always  remain grateful to Great Britain for this bold and generous act. Its  immediate effect has been consternation in Vienna and encouragement both to  the Czecho-Slovak soldiers fighting on the side of the Entente and to the  Czech leaders courageously defending Bohemia's rights in Vienna. As deputy  Klofac put it at a meeting in Laibach on August 15:        \"Henceforward the Czechs will refuse to hold any negotiations with      Vienna, with whom any compromise is now out of the question. The      Czecho-Slovaks will firmly continue the struggle for complete national      independence, strengthened by the support of other Slavs, and by the      knowledge that the British and other Allied governments had formally      acknowledged and were working for the establishment of an independent      Czecho-Slovak State.\"    This chapter would not be complete if we did not quote the subsequent  declarations of the United States of America and Japan, practically  endorsing the British declaration.    On September 3, Mr. Lansing issued the following statement:        \"The Czecho-Slovak peoples having taken up arms against the German and      Austro-Hungarian empires, and having placed in the field organised      armies, which are waging war against those empires under officers of      their own nationality and in accordance with the rules and practices of      civilised nations, and Czecho-Slovaks having in the prosecution of      their independence in the present war confided the supreme political      authority to the Czecho-Slovak National Council, the Government of the      United States recognises that a state of belligerency exists"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#19)"],[1,"fact; _secondly,_ that it be consistent with itself. If  we observe these circumstances, and render our definition intelligible,  I am persuaded that all mankind will be found of one opinion with  regard to it.    It is universally allowed that nothing exists without a cause of its  existence, and that chance, when strictly examined, is a mere negative  word, and means not any real power which has anywhere a being in nature.  But it is pretended that some causes are necessary, some not necessary.  Here then is the advantage of definitions. Let any one _define_ a cause,  without comprehending, as a part of the definition, a _necessary  connexion_ with its effect; and let him show distinctly the origin of  the idea, expressed by the definition; and I shall readily give up the  whole controversy. But if the foregoing explication of the matter be  received, this must be absolutely impracticable. Had not objects a  regular conjunction with each other, we should never have entertained  any notion of cause and effect; and this regular conjunction produces  that inference of the understanding, which is the only connexion, that  we can have any comprehension of. Whoever attempts a definition of  cause, exclusive of these circumstances, will be obliged either to  employ unintelligible terms or such as are synonymous to the term which  he endeavours to define.[18] And if the definition above mentioned be  admitted; liberty, when opposed to necessity, not to constraint, is the  same thing with chance; which is universally allowed to have no  existence.        [18] Thus, if a cause be defined, _that which produces any      thing;_ it is easy to observe, that _producing_ is synonymous      to _causing._ In like manner, if a cause be defined, _that by      which any thing exists;_ this is liable to the same objection.      For what is meant by these words, _by which?_ Had it been said,      that a cause is _that_ after which _any thing constantly      exists;_ we should have understood the terms. For this is,      indeed, all we know of the matter. And this constancy forms the      very essence of necessity, nor have we any other idea of it.      PART II.      75. There is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more  blameable, than, in philosophical disputes, to endeavour the refutation  of any hypothesis, by a pretence of its dangerous consequences to  religion and morality. When any opinion leads to absurdities, it is  certainly false; but it is not certain that an opinion is false, because  it is of dangerous consequence. Such topics, therefore, ought entirely  to be forborne; as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only  to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general,  without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I frankly submit to  an examination of this kind, and shall venture to affirm that the  doctrines, both of necessity and of liberty, as above explained, are not  only consistent with morality, but are absolutely essential to  its support.    Necessity may be defined two ways, conformably to the two definitions of  _cause_, of which it makes an essential part. It consists either in the  constant conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the  understanding from one object to another. Now necessity, in both these  senses, (which, indeed, are at bottom the same) has universally, though  tacitly, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allowed  to belong to the will of man; and no one has ever pretended to deny that  we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that those  inferences are founded on the experienced union of like actions, with  like motives, inclinations, and circumstances. The only particular in  which any one can differ, is, that either, perhaps, he will refuse to  give the name of necessity to this property of human actions: But as  long as the meaning is understood, I hope the word can do no harm: Or  that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the  operations of matter. But this, it must be acknowledged, can be of no  consequence to morality or religion, whatever it may be to natural  philosophy or metaphysics. We may here be mistaken in asserting that  there is no idea of any other necessity or connexion in the actions of  body: But surely we ascribe nothing to the actions of the mind, but what  everyone does, and must readily allow of. We change no circumstance in  the received orthodox system with regard to the will, but only in that  with regard to material objects and causes. Nothing, therefore, can be  more innocent, at least, than this doctrine.    76. All laws being founded on rewards and punishments, it is supposed as  a fundamental principle, that these motives have a regular and uniform  influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil  actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but, as it  is usually conjoined with the action, it must be esteemed a _cause_, and  be looked upon as an instance of that necessity, which we would here  establish.    The only proper object of hatred or vengeance is a person or creature,  endowed with thought and consciousness; and when any criminal or  injurious actions excite that passion, it is only by their relation to  the person, or connexion with him. Actions are, by their very nature,  temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some _cause_ in  the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can  neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil. The actions  themselves may be blameable; they may be contrary to all the rules of  morality and religion: But the person is not answerable for them; and as  they proceeded from nothing in him that is durable and constant, and  leave nothing of that nature behind them, it is impossible he can, upon  their account, become the object of punishment or vengeance. According  to the principle, therefore, which denies necessity, and consequently  causes, a man is as pure and untainted, after having committed the most  horrid crime, as at the first moment of his birth, nor is his character  anywise concerned in his actions, since they are not derived from it,  and the wickedness of the one can never be used as a proof of the  depravity of the other.    Men are not blamed for such actions as they perform ignorantly and  casually, whatever may be the consequences. Why? but because the  principles of these actions are only momentary, and terminate in them  alone. Men are less blamed for such actions as they perform hastily and  unpremeditately than for such as proceed from deliberation. For what  reason? but because a hasty temper, though a constant cause or  principle in the mind, operates only by intervals, and infects not the  whole character. Again, repentance wipes off every crime, if attended  with a reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for?  but by asserting that actions render a person criminal merely as they  are proofs of criminal principles in the mind; and when, by an  alteration of these principles, they cease to be just proofs, they  likewise cease to be criminal. But, except upon the doctrine of  necessity, they never were just proofs, and consequently never  were criminal.    77. It will be equally easy to prove, and from the same arguments, that  _liberty_, according to that definition above mentioned, in which all  men agree, is also essential to morality, and that no human actions,  where it is wanting, are susceptible of any moral qualities, or can be  the objects either of approbation or dislike. For as actions are objects  of our moral sentiment, so far only as they are indications of the  internal character, passions, and affections; it is impossible that they  can give rise either to praise or blame, where they proceed not from  these principles, but are derived altogether from external violence.    78. I pretend not to have obviated or removed all objections to this  theory, with regard to necessity and liberty. I can foresee other  objections, derived from topics which have not here been treated of. It  may be said, for instance, that, if voluntary actions be subjected to  the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter, there is a  continued chain of necessary causes, pre-ordained and pre-determined,  reaching from the original cause of all to every single volition of  every human creature. No contingency anywhere in the universe; no  indifference; no liberty. While we act, we are, at the same time, acted  upon. The ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of the  world, who first bestowed motion on this immense machine, and placed all  beings in that particular position, whence every subsequent event, by  an inevitable necessity, must result. Human actions, therefore, either  can have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from so good a cause;  or if they have any turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same  guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author.  For as a man, who fired a mine, is answerable for all the consequences  whether the train he employed be long or short; so wherever a continued  chain of necessary causes is fixed, that Being, either finite or  infinite, who produces the first, is likewise the author of all the  rest, and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong  to them. Our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this  rule, upon unquestionable reasons, when we examine the consequences of  any human action; and these reasons must still have greater force when  applied to the volitions and intentions of a Being infinitely wise and  powerful. Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for so limited a  creature as man; but those imperfections have no place in our Creator.  He foresaw, he ordained, he intended all those actions of men, which we  so rashly pronounce criminal. And we"]]]
