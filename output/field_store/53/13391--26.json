My time is not valuable.          Preventing a Scandal.    Boys should never be afraid or ashamed to do little odd jobs by which to  acquire money. Too many boys are afraid, or at least seem to be  embarrassed when asked to do chores, and thus earn small sums of money. In  order to appreciate wealth we must earn it ourselves. That is the reason I  labor. I do not need to labor. My parents are still living, and they  certainly would not see me suffer for the necessities of life. But life in  that way would not have the keen relish that it would if I earned the  money myself.    Sawing wood used to be a favorite pastime with boys twenty years ago. I  remember the first money I ever earned was by sawing wood. My brother and  myself were to receive $5 for sawing five cords of wood. We allowed the  job to stand, however, until the weather got quite warm, and then we  decided to hire a foreigner who came along that way one glorious summer  day when all nature seemed tickled and we knew that the fish would be apt  to bite. So we hired the foreigner, and while he sawed, we would bet with  him on various \"dead sure things\" until he got the wood sawed, when he  went away owing us fifty cents.    We had a neighbor who was very wealthy. He noticed that we boys earned our  own spending money, and he yearned to have his son try to ditto. So he  told the boy that he was going away for a few weeks and that he would give  him $2 per cord, or double price, to saw the wood. He wanted to teach the  boy to earn and appreciate his money. So, when the old man went away, the  boy secured a colored man to do the job at $1 per cord, by which process  the youth made $10. This he judiciously invested in clothes, meeting his  father at the train in a new summer suit and a speckled cane. The old man  said he could see by the sparkle in the boy's clear, honest eyes, that  healthful exercise was what boys needed.    When I was a boy I frequently acquired large sums of money by carrying  coal up two flights of stairs for wealthy people who were too fat to do it  themselves. This money I invested from time to time in side shows and  other zoological attractions.    One day I saw a coal cart back up and unload itself on the walk in such a  way as to indicate that the coal would have to be manually elevated inside  the building. I waited till I nearly froze to death, for the owner to come  along and solicit my aid. Finally he came. He smelled strong of carbolic  acid, and I afterward learned that he was a physician and surgeon.    We haggled over the price for some time, as I had to carry the coal up two  flights in an old waste paper basket and it was quite a task. Finally we  agreed. I proceeded with the work. About dusk I went up the last flight of  stairs with the last load. My feet seemed to weigh about nineteen pounds  apiece and my face was very sombre.    In the gloaming I saw my employer. He was writing a prescription by the  dim, uncertain light. He told me to put the last basketful in the little  closet off the hall and then come and get my pay. I took the coal into the  closet, but I do not know what I did with it. As I opened the door and  stepped in, a tall skeleton got down off the nail and embraced me like a  prodigal son. It fell on my neck and draped itself all over me. Its  glittering phalanges entered the bosom of my gingham shirt and rested  lightly on the pit of my stomach. I could feel the pelvis bone in the  small of my back. The room was dark, but I did not light the gas. Whether  it was the skeleton of a lady or gentleman, I never knew; but I thought,  for the sake of my good name, I would not remain. My good name and a  strong yearning for home were all that I had at that time.    So I went home. Afterwards, I learned that this physician got all his coal  carried up stairs for nothing in this way, and he had tried to get rooms  two flights further up in the building, so that the boys would have  further to fall when they made their egress.          About Portraits.    Hudson, Wis., August 25, 1885.    Hon. William F. Vilas, Postmaster-General, Washington, D.C.    Dear Sir,--For some time I have been thinking of writing to you and asking  you how you were getting along with your department since I left it. I did  not wish to write you for the purpose of currying favor with an  administration against which I squandered a ballot last fall. Neither do I  desire to convey the impression that I would like to open a correspondence  with you for the purpose of killing time. If you ever feel like sitting  down and answering this letter in an off-hand way it would please me very  much, but do not put yourself out to do so. I wanted to ask you, however,  how you like the pictures of yourself recently published by the patent  insides. That was my principal object in writing. Having seen you before  this great calamity befell you, I wanted to inquire whether you had really  changed so much. As I remember your face, it was rather unusually  intellectual and attractive for a great man. Great men are very rarely  pretty. I guess that, aside from yourself, myself, and Mr. Evarts, there  is hardly an eminent man in the country who would be considered handsome.  But the engraver has done you a great injustice, or else you have sadly  changed since I saw you. It hardly seems possible that your nose has  drifted around to leeward and swelled up at the end, as the engraver would  have us believe. I do not believe that in a few short months the look of  firmness and conscious rectitude that I noticed could have changed to that  of indecision and vacuity which we see in some of your late portraits as  printed.    [Illustration: A NOSE ON THE BIAS.]    I saw one yesterday, with your name attached to it, and it made my heart  ache for your family. As a resident in your State I felt humiliated. Two  of Wisconsin's ablest men have been thus slaughtered by the rude broad-axe  of the engraver. Last fall, Senator Spooner, who is also a man with a  first-class head and face, was libeled in this same reckless way. It makes  me mad, and in that way impairs my usefulness. I am not a good citizen,  husband or father when I am mad. I am a perfect simoom of wrath at such  times, and I am not responsible for what I do.    Nothing can arouse the indignation of your friends, regardless of party,  so much as the thought that while you are working so hard in the  postoffice at Washington with your coat off, collecting box rent and  making up the Western mail, the remorseless engraver and electrotyper are  seeking to down you by making pictures of you in which you appear either  as a dude or a tough.    While I have not the pleasure of being a member of your party, having  belonged to what has been sneeringly alluded to as the g.o.p., I cannot  refrain from expressing my sympathy at this time. Though we may have  differed heretofore upon important questions of political economy, I  cannot exult over these portraits. Others may gloat over these efforts to  injure you, but I do not. I am not much of a gloater, anyhow.    I leave those to gloat who are in the gloat business.    Still, it is one of the drawbacks incident to greatness. We struggle hard  through life that we may win the confidence of our fellow-men, only at  last to have pictures of ourselves printed and distributed where they will  injure us.    [Illustration: ASSORTED PHYSIOGNOMY.]    I desire to add before closing this letter, Mr. Vilas, that with those who  are acquainted with you and know your sterling worth, these portraits will  make no difference. We will not allow them to influence us socially or  politically. What the effect may be upon offensive partisans who are total  strangers to you, I do not know.    My theory in relation to these cuts is, that they are combined and  interchangeable, so that, with slight modifications, they are used for all  great men. The cut, with the extras that go with it, consists of one head  with hair (front view), one bald head (front view), one head with hair  (side view), one bald head (side view), one pair eyes (with glasses), one  pair eyes (plain), one Roman nose, one Grecian nose, one turn-up nose, one  set whiskers (full), one moustache, one pair side-whiskers, one chin, one  set large ears, one set medium ears, one set small ears, one set  shoulders, with collar and necktie for above, one monkey-wrench, one set  quoins, one galley, one oil can, one screwdriver. These different features  are then arranged so that a great variety of clergymen, murderers,  senators, embezzlers, artists, dynamiters, humorists, arsonists,  larcenists, poets, statesmen, base ball players, rinkists, pianists,  capitalists, bigamists and sluggists are easily represented. No newspaper  office should be without them. They are very simple, and any child can  easily learn to operate it. They are invaluable in all cases, for no one  knows at what moment a revolting crime may be committed by a comparatively  unknown man, whose portrait you wish to give, and in this age of rapid  political transformations, presentations and combinations, no enterprising  paper should delay the acquisition of a combined portrait for the use of  its readers.    Hoping that you are well, and that you will at once proceed to let no  guilty man escape, I remain, yours truly,    Bill Nye.          The Old South.    The Old South Meeting House, in Boston, is the most remarkable structure  in many respects to be found in that remarkable city. Always eager  wherever I go to search out at once the gospel privileges, it is not to be  wondered at, that I should have gone to the Old South the first day after  I landed in Boston.    It is hardly necessary to go over the history of the Old South, except,  perhaps, to refresh the memory of those who live outside of Boston. The  Old South Society was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#19)"],[1,"ll, strictly speaking: the heroine gets out of  her difficulties by demanding of her task-master the completion of  counter-tasks equally hard, or by showing him the absurdity of his  demands. (See Bolte-Polivka, 2 : 362-370, for a full discussion  of these subgroups.) \"In all stories of the kind,\" writes Child,  \"the person upon whom a task is imposed stands acquitted if another  of no less difficulty is devised which must be performed first. This  preliminary may be something that is essential for the execution of  the other, as in the German ballads, or equally well something that  has no kind of relation to the original requisition, as in the English  ballads.\" It will be seen that in the nature of the counter-demands  the Filipino stories agree rather with the German than the English.    (6) Hero is forbidden to walk on the king's ground. To circumvent the  king, hero fills a sledge with earth taken from his own orchard, and  has himself drawn into the presence of his Majesty. When challenged,  the hero protests that he is not on the king's ground, but his  own. This same episode is found in \"Juan the Fool,\" No. 49 (q. v.).    (7) The stealing of the sleeping king by the banished wife, who has  permission to take with her from the palace what she loves best,  is found only in A. This episode, however, is very common elsewhere,  and forms the conclusion of more than seventy Occidental stories of  this cycle. (See Bolte-Polivka, 2 : 349-355.)    (8) The division of the hen, found in B and also at the end of \"Juan  the Fool\" (No. 49), is fully discussed by Bolte and Polivka (2 :  360). See also R. Koehler's notes to Gonzenbach, 2 : 205-206. The  combination of this motif with the \"chastity-wager\" motif found in  \"Rodolfo\" (B), is also met with in a Mentonais story, \"La femme avisee\"  (Romania, 11 : 415-416).    (9) For wearing of shoes only when crossing rivers, and raising  umbrella only when sleeping under a tree, see again \"Juan the Fool.\" A  rather close parallel to this incident, as well as to the seemingly  foolish questions Rodolfo asks Estela's father, and the daughter's  wise interpretation of them, may be found in the Kashmir story,  \"Why the Fish laughed\" (Knowles, 484-490 = Jacob 1, No. XXIV). See  also a Tibetan story in Ralston 2 : 111; Benfey in \"Ausland,\" 1859,  p. 487; Spence Hardy, \"Manual of Buddhism,\" pp. 220-227, 364. Compare  especially Bompas, No. LXXXIX, \"The Bridegroom who spoke in Riddles.\"    Finally mention may be made of two Arabian stories overlooked by Bolte  and Polivka, in one of which a woman sends supper to a stranger, and  along with the food an enigmatical message describing what she has  sent. The Negress porter eats a part of the food, but delivers the  message. The stranger shrewdly guesses its meaning, and sends back a  reply that convicts the Negress of theft of a part of the gift. The  other story opens with the \"bride-wager\" riddle, and later enumerates  many instances of the ingenuity of the clever young wife. See Phillott  and Azoo, \"Some Arab Folk-Tales from Hazramaut,\" Nos. I and XVII  (in JRASB 2 [1906] : 399-439).    Benfey (Ausland, 1859, passim) traces the story of the \"Clever Lass\"  back to India. The original situation consisted of the testing of the  sagacity of a minister who had fallen into disgrace. This minister  aids his royal master in a riddle-contest with a neighboring hostile  king. Later in the development of the cycle these sagacity tests were  transferred to a wife who helps her husband, or to a maiden who helps  her father, out of similar difficulties. (Compare the last part of my  note to No. 1 in this collection.) Bolte and Polivka, however (2 :  373) seem to think it probable that the last part of the story--the  marriage of the heroine, her expulsion, and her theft of the sleeping  king--was native to Europe.    The Filipino folk-tales belonging to this cycle appear to go back  directly to India as a source. Incident 4 (see above) seems to me  conclusive evidence, as this is a purely Oriental conception, being  recorded only in India, Tibet, and South Siberia. The chap-book version  (A) doubtless owes much to popular tradition in the Islands, although  the anonymous author, in his \"Preface to the Reader,\" says that he has  derived his story from a book (unnamed),--hango sa novela. I have not  been able to trace his original; there is no Spanish form of the tale,  so far as I know.    Compare with this whole cycle No. 38, \"A Negrito Slave,\" and the notes.        TALE 8    THE STORY OF ZARAGOZA.      Narrated by Teodato P. Macabulos, a Tagalog from Manila.      Years and years ago there lived in a village a poor couple, Luis and  Maria. Luis was lazy and selfish, while Maria was hard-working and  dutiful. Three children had been born to this pair, but none had lived  long enough to be baptized. The wife was once more about to be blessed  with a child, and Luis made up his mind what he should do to save its  life. Soon the day came when Maria bore her second son. Luis, fearing  that this child, like the others, would die unchristened, decided to  have it baptized the very next morning. Maria was very glad to know  of her husband's determination, for she believed that the early deaths  of their other children were probably due to delay in baptizing them.    The next morning Luis, with the infant in his arms, hastened to  the church; but in his haste he forgot to ask his wife who should  stand as godfather. As he was considering this oversight, a strange  man passed by, whom he asked, \"Will you be so kind as to act as my  child's godfather?\"    \"With all my heart,\" was the stranger's reply.    They then entered the church, and the child was named Luis, after his  father. When the services were over, Luis entreated Zaragoza--such  was the name of the godfather--to dine at his house. As Zaragoza  had just arrived in that village for the first time, he was but too  ready to accept the invitation. Now, Zaragoza was a kind-hearted man,  and soon won the confidence of his host and hostess, who invited him  to remain with them for several days. Luis and Zaragoza became close  friends, and often consulted each other on matters of importance.    One evening, as the two friends were conversing, their talk turned  upon the affairs of the kingdom. Luis told his friend how the king  oppressed the people by levying heavy taxes on all sorts of property,  and for that reason was very rich. Zaragoza, moved by the news,  decided to avenge the wrongs of the people. Luis hesitated, for he  could think of no sure means of punishing the tyrannical monarch. Then  Zaragoza suggested that they should try to steal the king's treasure,  which was hidden in a cellar of the palace. Luis was much pleased with  the project, for he thought that it was Zaragoza's plan for them to  enrich themselves and live in comfort and luxury.    Accordingly, one evening the two friends, with a pick-axe, a hoe,  and a shovel, directed their way towards the palace. They approached  the cellar by a small door, and then began to dig in the ground at  the foot of the cellar wall. After a few hours of steady work, they  succeeded in making an excavation leading into the interior. Zaragoza  entered, and gathered up as many bags of money as he and Luis could  carry. During the night they made several trips to the cellar, each  time taking back to their house as much money as they could manage. For  a long time the secret way was not discovered, and the two friends  lost no opportunity of increasing their already great hoard. Zaragoza  gave away freely much of his share to the poor; but his friend was  selfish, and kept constantly admonishing him not to be too liberal.    In time the king observed that the bulk of his treasure was  considerably reduced, and he ordered his soldiers to find out what had  caused the disappearance of so much money. Upon close examination,  the soldiers discovered the secret passage; and the king, enraged,  summoned his counsellors to discuss what should be done to punish  the thief.    In the mean time the two friends were earnestly discussing whether  they should get more bags of money, or should refrain from making  further thefts. Zaragoza suggested that they would better first get  in touch with the secret deliberations of the court before making  another attempt. Luis, however, as if called by fate, insisted that  they should make one more visit to the king's cellar, and then inquire  about the unrest at court. Persuaded against his better judgment,  Zaragoza followed his friend to the palace, and saw that their secret  passage was in the same condition as they had lately left it. Luis  lowered himself into the hole; but lo! the whiz of an arrow was heard,  and then a faint cry from Luis.    \"What is the matter? Are you hurt?\" asked Zaragoza.    \"I am dying! Take care of my son!\" These were Luis's last words.    Zaragoza knew not what to do. He tried to pull up the dead body of his  friend; but in vain, for it was firmly caught between two heavy blocks  of wood, and was pierced by many arrows. But Zaragoza was shrewd;  and, fearing the consequences of the discovery of Luis's corpse,  he cut off the dead man's head and hurried home with it, leaving  the body behind. He broke the fatal news to Maria, whose grief was  boundless. She asked him why he had mutilated her husband's body, and  he satisfied her by telling her that they would be betrayed if Luis  were recognized. Taking young Luis in her arms, Maria said, \"For the  sake of your godson, see that his father's body is properly buried.\"    \"Upon my word of honor, I promise to do as you wish,\" was Zaragoza's  reply.    Meantime the king was discussing the theft with his advisers. Finally,  wishing to identify the criminal, the king decreed that the body should  be carried through the principal streets of the city and neighboring  villages, followed by a train of soldiers, who were instructed to  arrest any"]]]
