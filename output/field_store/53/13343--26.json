[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#19)"],[1,"the open window, had had all his ardour for the chase  redoubled by the sight of the cupboard door, which Fenn in his hurry  had not remembered to close. Mr Kay had made certain by two separate  trials that that door had been locked. And now it was wide open. Ergo,  the apostle of the jemmy and the skeleton key must still be in the  house. Mr Kay, secure in the recollection that burglars never show  fight if they can possibly help it, determined to search the house.    Fenn made up his mind swiftly. There was no time to finish dressing.  Mr Kay, peering round, might note the absence of the rest of his  clothes from their accustomed pegs if he got into bed as he was. There  was only one thing to be done. He threw back the bed-clothes, ruffled  the sheets till the bed looked as if it had been slept in, and opened  the door just as Mr Kay reached the threshold.    \"Anything the matter, sir?\" asked Fenn, promptly. \"I heard a noise  downstairs. Can I help you?\"    Mr Kay looked carefully at the ex-head of his house. Fenn was a  finely-developed youth. He stood six feet, and all of him that was not  bone was muscle. A useful colleague to have by one in a hunt for a  possibly ferocious burglar.    So thought Mr Kay.    \"So _you_ heard the noise?\" he said. \"Well, perhaps you had  better come with me. There is no doubt that a burglar has entered the  house tonight, in spite of the fact that I locked all the windows  myself. Your study window was unlocked, Fenn. It was extremely  careless of you to leave it in such a condition, and I hope you will  be more careful in future. Why, somebody might have got in through  it.\"    Fenn thought it was not at all unlikely.    \"Come along, then. I am sure the man is still in the house. He was  hiding in the cupboard by the dining-room. I know it. I am sure he is  still in the house.\"    But, in spite of the fact that Fenn was equally sure, half an hour's  search failed to discover any lurking evil-doer.    \"You had better go to bed, Fenn,\" said Mr Kay, disgustedly, at the end  of that period. \"He must have got back in some extraordinary manner.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" agreed Fenn.    He himself had certainly got back in a very extraordinary manner.    However, he _had_ got back, which was the main point.          XVIII    A VAIN QUEST      After all he had gone through that night, it disturbed Fenn very  little to find on the following morning that the professional  cracksman had gone off with one of the cups in his study. Certainly,  it was not as bad as it might have been, for he had only abstracted  one out of the half dozen that decorated the room. Fenn was a fine  runner, and had won the \"sprint\" events at the sports for two years  now.    The news of the burglary at Kay's soon spread about the school. Mr Kay  mentioned it to Mr Mulholland, and Mr Mulholland discussed it at lunch  with the prefects of his house. The juniors of Kay's were among the  last to hear of it, but when they did, they made the most of it, to  the disgust of the School House fags, to whom the episode seemed in  the nature of an infringement of copyright. Several spirited  by-battles took place that day owing to this, and at the lower end of  the table of Kay's dining-room at tea that evening there could be seen  many swollen countenances. All, however, wore pleased smiles. They had  proved to the School House their right to have a burglary of their own  if they liked. It was the first occasion since Kennedy had become head  of the house that Kay's had united in a common and patriotic cause.    Directly afternoon school was over that day, Fenn started for the  town. The only thing that caused him any anxiety now was the fear lest  the cap which he had left in the house in the High Street might rise  up as evidence against him later on. Except for that, he was safe. The  headmaster had evidently not remembered his absence from the festive  board, or he would have spoken to him on the subject before now. If he  could but recover the lost cap, all would be right with the world.  Give him back that cap, and he would turn over a new leaf with a  rapidity and emphasis which would lower the world's record for that  performance. He would be a reformed character. He would even go to the  extent of calling a truce with Mr Kay, climbing down to Kennedy, and  offering him his services in his attempt to lick the house into shape.    As a matter of fact, he had had this idea before. Jimmy Silver, who  was in the position--common at school--of being very friendly with two  people who were not on speaking terms, had been at him on the topic.    \"It's rot,\" James had said, with perfect truth, \"to see two chaps like  you making idiots of themselves over a house like Kay's. And it's all  your fault, too,\" he had added frankly. \"You know jolly well you  aren't playing the game. You ought to be backing Kennedy up all the  time. Instead of which, you go about trying to look like a Christian  martyr--\"    \"I don't,\" said Fenn, indignantly.    \"Well, like a stuffed frog, then--it's all the same to me. It's  perfect rot. If I'm walking with Kennedy, you stalk past as if we'd  both got the plague or something. And if I'm with you, Kennedy  suddenly remembers an appointment, and dashes off at a gallop in the  opposite direction. If I had to award the bronze medal for drivelling  lunacy in this place, you would get it by a narrow margin, and Kennedy  would be _proxime_, and honourably mentioned. Silly idiots!\"    \"Don't stop, Jimmy. Keep it up,\" said Fenn, settling himself in his  chair. The dialogue was taking place in Silver's study.    \"My dear chap, you didn't think I'd finished, surely! I was only  trying to find some description that would suit you. But it's no good.  I can't. Look here, take my advice--the advice,\" he added, in the  melodramatic voice he was in the habit of using whenever he wished to  conceal the fact that he was speaking seriously, \"of an old man who  wishes ye both well. Go to Kennedy, fling yourself on his chest, and  say, 'We have done those things which we ought not to have done--' No.  As you were! Compn'y, 'shun! Say 'J. Silver says that I am a rotter. I  am a worm. I have made an ass of myself. But I will be good. Shake,  pard!' That's what you've got to do. Come in.\"    And in had come Kennedy. The attractions of Kay's were small, and he  usually looked in on Jimmy Silver in the afternoons.    \"Oh, sorry,\" he said, as he saw Fenn. \"I thought you were alone,  Jimmy.\"    \"I was just going,\" said Fenn, politely.    \"Oh, don't let me disturb you,\" protested Kennedy, with winning  courtesy.    \"Not at all,\" said Fenn.    \"Oh, if you really were--\"    \"Oh, yes, really.\"    \"Get out, then,\" growled Jimmy, who had been listening in speechless  disgust to the beautifully polite conversation just recorded. \"I'll  forward that bronze medal to you, Fenn.\"    And as the door closed he had turned to rend Kennedy as he had rent  Fenn; while Fenn walked back to Kay's feeling that there was a good  deal in what Jimmy had said.    So that when he went down town that afternoon in search of his cap, he  pondered as he walked over the advisability of making a fresh start.  It would not be a bad idea. But first he must concentrate his energies  on recovering what he had lost.    He found the house in the High Street without a great deal of  difficulty, for he had marked the spot carefully as far as that had  been possible in the fog.    The door was opened to him, not by the old man with whom he had  exchanged amenities on the previous night, but by a short, thick  fellow, who looked exactly like a picture of a loafer from the pages  of a comic journal. He eyed Fenn with what might have been meant for  an inquiring look. To Fenn it seemed merely menacing.    \"Wodyer want?\" he asked, abruptly.    Eckleton was not a great distance from London, and, as a consequence,  many of London's choicest blackguards migrated there from time to  time. During the hopping season, and while the local races were on,  one might meet with two Cockney twangs for every country accent.    \"I want to see the old gentleman who lives here,\" said Fenn.    \"Wot old gentleman?\"    \"I'm afraid I don't know his name. Is this a home for old gentlemen?  If you'll bring out all you've got, I'll find my one.\"    \"Wodyer want see the old gentleman for?\"    \"To ask for my cap. I left it here last night.\"    \"Oh, yer left it 'ere last night! Well, yer cawn't see 'im.\"    \"Not from here, no,\" agreed Fenn. \"Being only eyes, you see,\" he  quoted happily, \"my wision's limited. But if you wouldn't mind moving  out of the way--\"    \"Yer cawn't see 'im. Blimey, 'ow much more of it, I should like to  know. Gerroutovit, cawn't yer! You and yer caps.\"    And he added a searching expletive by way of concluding the sentence  fittingly. After which he slipped back and slammed the door, leaving  Fenn waiting outside like the Peri at the gate of Paradise.    His resemblance to the Peri ceased after the first quarter of a  minute. That lady, we read, took her expulsion lying down. Fenn was  more vigorous. He seized the knocker, and banged lustily on the door.  He had given up all hope of getting back the cap. All he wanted was to  get the doorkeeper out into the open again, when he would proceed to  show him, to the best of his ability, what was what. It would not be  the first time he had taken on a gentleman of the same class and a  similar type of conversation.    But the man refused to be drawn. For all the reply Fenn's knocking  produced, the house might have been empty. At last, having tired his  wrist and collected a small crowd of Young Eckleton, who looked as if  they expected him to proceed to further efforts for their amusement,  he gave it up, and retired down the High Street with what dignity he  could command--which, as he was followed for the first fifty yards by  the silent but obviously expectant youths, was not a great deal.    They left him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#19)"],[1,"did not care to suppose anything so unpleasant.    Mr Dexter was still prowling about on the junior gravel, when the two  Irishmen ran round and across the senior gravel to the gymnasium. Here  they put in a few minutes' gentle sparring, and then marched boldly up  to Mr Day (who happened to have looked in five minutes after their  arrival) and got their paper.    \"What time did O'Hara and Moriarty arrive at the gymnasium?\" asked Mr  Dexter of Mr Day next morning.    \"O'Hara and Moriarty? Really, I can't remember. I know they _left_  at about a quarter to seven.\"    That profound thinker, Mr Tony Weller, was never so correct as in his  views respecting the value of an _alibi_. There are few better  things in an emergency.          XVIII    O'HARA EXCELS HIMSELF      It was Renford's turn next morning to get up and feed the ferrets.  Harvey had done it the day before.    Renford was not a youth who enjoyed early rising, but in the cause of  the ferrets he would have endured anything, so at six punctually he  slid out of bed, dressed quietly, so as not to disturb the rest of the  dormitory, and ran over to the vault. To his utter amazement he found  it locked. Such a thing had never been done before in the whole course  of his experience. He tugged at the handle, but not an inch or a  fraction of an inch would the door yield. The policy of the Open Door  had ceased to find favour in the eyes of the authorities.    A feeling of blank despair seized upon him. He thought of the dismay of  the ferrets when they woke up and realised that there was no chance of  breakfast for them. And then they would gradually waste away, and some  day somebody would go down to the vault to fetch chairs, and would come  upon two mouldering skeletons, and wonder what they had once been. He  almost wept at the vision so conjured up.    There was nobody about. Perhaps he might break in somehow. But then  there was nothing to get to work with. He could not kick the door down.  No, he must give it up, and the ferrets' breakfast-hour must be  postponed. Possibly Harvey might be able to think of something.    \"Fed 'em?\" inquired Harvey, when they met at breakfast.    \"No, I couldn't.\"    \"Why on earth not? You didn't oversleep yourself?\"    Renford poured his tale into his friend's shocked ears.    \"My hat!\" said Harvey, when he had finished, \"what on earth are we to  do? They'll starve.\"    Renford nodded mournfully.    \"Whatever made them go and lock the door?\" he said.    He seemed to think the authorities should have given him due notice of  such an action.    \"You're sure they have locked it? It isn't only stuck or something?\"    \"I lugged at the handle for hours. But you can go and see for yourself  if you like.\"    Harvey went, and, waiting till the coast was clear, attached himself to  the handle with a prehensile grasp, and put his back into one strenuous  tug. It was even as Renford had said. The door was locked beyond  possibility of doubt.    Renford and he went over to school that morning with long faces and a  general air of acute depression. It was perhaps fortunate for their  purpose that they did, for had their appearance been normal it might  not have attracted O'Hara's attention. As it was, the Irishman, meeting  them on the junior gravel, stopped and asked them what was wrong. Since  the adventure in the vault, he had felt an interest in Renford and  Harvey.    The two told their story in alternate sentences like the Strophe and  Antistrophe of a Greek chorus. (\"Steichomuthics,\" your Greek scholar  calls it, I fancy. Ha, yes! Just so.)    \"So ye can't get in because they've locked the door, an' ye don't know  what to do about it?\" said O'Hara, at the conclusion of the narrative.    Renford and Harvey informed him in chorus that that _was_ the  state of the game up to present date.    \"An' ye want me to get them out for you?\"    Neither had dared to hope that he would go so far as this. What they  had looked for had been at the most a few thoughtful words of advice.  That such a master-strategist as O'Hara should take up their cause was  an unexampled piece of good luck.    \"If you only would,\" said Harvey.    \"We should be most awfully obliged,\" said Renford.    \"Very well,\" said O'Hara.    They thanked him profusely.    O'Hara replied that it would be a privilege.    He should be sorry, he said, to have anything happen to the ferrets.    Renford and Harvey went on into school feeling more cheerful. If the  ferrets could be extracted from their present tight corner, O'Hara was  the man to do it.    O'Hara had not made his offer of assistance in any spirit of doubt. He  was certain that he could do what he had promised. For it had not  escaped his memory that this was a Tuesday--in other words, a  mathematics morning up to the quarter to eleven interval. That meant,  as has been explained previously, that, while the rest of the school  were in the form-rooms, he would be out in the passage, if he cared to  be. There would be no witnesses to what he was going to do.    But, by that curious perversity of fate which is so often noticeable,  Mr Banks was in a peculiarly lamb-like and long-suffering mood this  morning. Actions for which O'Hara would on other days have been  expelled from the room without hope of return, today were greeted with  a mild \"Don't do that, please, O'Hara,\" or even the ridiculously  inadequate \"O'Hara!\" It was perfectly disheartening. O'Hara began to  ask himself bitterly what was the use of ragging at all if this was how  it was received. And the moments were flying, and his promise to  Renford and Harvey still remained unfulfilled.    He prepared for fresh efforts.    So desperate was he, that he even resorted to crude methods like the  throwing of paper balls and the dropping of books. And when your really  scientific ragger sinks to this, he is nearing the end of his tether.  O'Hara hated to be rude, but there seemed no help for it.    The striking of a quarter past ten improved his chances. It had been  privily agreed upon beforehand amongst the members of the class that at  a quarter past ten every one was to sneeze simultaneously. The noise  startled Mr Banks considerably. The angelic mood began to wear off. A  man may be long-suffering, but he likes to draw the line somewhere.    \"Another exhibition like that,\" he said, sharply, \"and the class stays  in after school, O'Hara!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Silence.\"    \"I said nothing, sir, really.\"    \"Boy, you made a cat-like noise with your mouth.\"    \"What _sort_ of noise, sir?\"    The form waited breathlessly. This peculiarly insidious question had  been invented for mathematical use by one Sandys, who had left at the  end of the previous summer. It was but rarely that the master increased  the gaiety of nations by answering the question in the manner desired.    Mr Banks, off his guard, fell into the trap.    \"A noise like this,\" he said curtly, and to the delighted audience came  the melodious sound of a \"Mi-aou\", which put O'Hara's effort completely  in the shade, and would have challenged comparison with the war-cry of  the stoutest mouser that ever trod a tile.    A storm of imitations arose from all parts of the room. Mr Banks turned  pink, and, going straight to the root of the disturbance, forthwith  evicted O'Hara.    O'Hara left with the satisfying feeling that his duty had been done.    Mr Banks' room was at the top of the middle block. He ran softly down  the stairs at his best pace. It was not likely that the master would  come out into the passage to see if he was still there, but it might  happen, and it would be best to run as few risks as possible.    He sprinted over to the junior block, raised the trap-door, and jumped  down. He knew where the ferrets had been placed, and had no difficulty  in finding them. In another minute he was in the passage again, with  the trap-door bolted behind him.    He now asked himself--what should he do with them? He must find a safe  place, or his labours would have been in vain.    Behind the fives-court, he thought, would be the spot. Nobody ever went  there. It meant a run of three hundred yards there and the same  distance back, and there was more than a chance that he might be seen  by one of the Powers. In which case he might find it rather hard to  explain what he was doing in the middle of the grounds with a couple of  ferrets in his possession when the hands of the clock pointed to twenty  minutes to eleven.    But the odds were against his being seen. He risked it.    When the bell rang for the quarter to eleven interval the ferrets were  in their new home, happily discussing a piece of meat--Renford's  contribution, held over from the morning's meal,--and O'Hara, looking  as if he had never left the passage for an instant, was making his way  through the departing mathematical class to apologise handsomely to Mr  Banks--as was his invariable custom--for his disgraceful behaviour  during the morning's lesson.          XIX    THE MAYOR'S VISIT      School prefects at Wrykyn did weekly essays for the headmaster. Those  who had got their scholarships at the 'Varsity, or who were going up in  the following year, used to take their essays to him after school and  read them to him--an unpopular and nerve-destroying practice, akin to  suicide. Trevor had got his scholarship in the previous November. He  was due at the headmaster's private house at six o'clock on the present  Tuesday. He was looking forward to the ordeal not without apprehension.  The essay subject this week had been \"One man's meat is another man's  poison\", and Clowes, whose idea of English Essay was that it should be  a medium for intempestive frivolity, had insisted on his beginning  with, \"While I cannot conscientiously go so far as to say that one  man's meat is another man's poison, yet I am certainly of opinion that  what is highly beneficial to one man may, on the other hand, to another  man, differently constituted, be "]]]
