But I wish we hadn't  disclosed ourselves to these people. They may demand to know where we  are going, and Brazil is too near Uruguay to make it safe to tell our  errand. They may guess it, however, from having read of the wreck, and  our departure.\"    \"Oh, I guess it will be all right,\" replied Captain Weston. \"We can  tell them we are on a pleasure trip. That's true enough. It would give  us great pleasure to find that gold.\"    \"There's a boat, with some officers in it, to judge by the amount of  gold lace on them, putting off from the ship,\" remarked Mr. Sharp.    \"Ha! Yes! Evidently they intend to pay us a formal visit,\" observed Mr.  Damon. \"Bless my gaiters, though. I'm not dressed to receive company. I  think I'll put on my dress suit.\"    \"It's too late,\" advised Tom. \"They'll be here in a minute.\"    Urged on by the lusty arms of the Brazilian sailors, the boat,  containing several officers, neared the floating submarine rapidly.    \"Ahoy there!\" called an officer in the bow, his accent betraying his  unfamiliarity with the English language. \"What craft are you?\"    \"Submarine, Advance, from New Jersey,\" replied Tom. \"Who are you?\"    \"Brazilian cruiser San Paulo,\" was the reply. \"Where are you bound?\"  went on the officer.    \"On pleasure,\" answered Captain Weston quickly. \"But why do you ask? We  are an American ship, sailing under American colors. Is this Brazilian  territory?\"    \"This island is--yes,\" came back the answer, and by this time the small  boat was at the side of the submarine. Before the adventurers could  have protested, had they a desire to do so, there were a number of  officers and the crew of the San Paulo on the small deck.    With a flourish, the officer who had done the questioning drew his  sword. Waving it in the air with a dramatic gesture, he exclaimed:    \"You're our prisoners! Resist and my men shall cut you down like dogs!  Seize them, men!\"    The sailors sprang forward, each one stationing himself at the side of  one of our friends, and grasping an arm.    \"What does this mean?\" cried Captain Weston indignantly.  \"If this is a  joke, you're carrying it too far. If you're in earnest, let me warn you  against interfering with Americans!\"    \"We know what we are doing,\" was the answer from the officer.    The sailor who had hold of Captain Weston endeavored to secure a  tighter grip. The captain turned suddenly, and seizing the man about  the waist, with an exercise of tremendous strength hurled him over his  head and into the sea, the man making a great splash.    \"That's the way I'll treat any one else who dares lay a hand on me!\"  shouted the captain, who was transformed from a mild-mannered  individual into an angry, modern giant. There was a gasp of  astonishment at his feat, as the ducked sailor crawled back into the  small boat. And he did not again venture on the deck of the submarine.    \"Seize them, men!\" cried the gold-laced officer again, and this time he  and his fellows, including the crew, crowded so closely around Tom and  his friends that they could do nothing. Even Captain Weston found it  impossible to offer any resistance, for three men grabbed hold of him  but his spirit was still a fighting one, and he struggled desperately  but uselessly.    \"How dare you do this?\" he cried.    \"Yes,\" added Tom, \"what right have you to interfere with us?\"    \"Every right,\" declared the gold-laced officer.    \"You are in Brazilian territory, and I arrest you.\"    \"What for?\" demanded Mr. Sharp.    \"Because your ship is an American submarine, and we have received word  that you intend to damage our shipping, and may try to torpedo our  warships. I believe you tried to disable us a little while ago, but  failed. We consider that an act of war and you will be treated  accordingly. Take them on board the San Paulo,\" the officer went on,  turning to his aides. \"We'll try them by court-marital here. Some of  you remain and guard this submarine. We will teach these filibustering  Americans a lesson.\"          Chapter Twenty    Doomed to Death      There was no room on the small deck of the submarine to make a stand  against the officers and crew of the Brazilian warship. In fact, the  capture of the gold-seekers had been effected so suddenly that their  astonishment almost deprived them of the power to think clearly.    At another command from the officer, who was addressed as Admiral  Fanchetti, several of the sailors began to lead Tom and his friends  toward the small boat.    \"Do you feel all right, father?\" inquired the lad anxiously, as he  looked at his parent. \"These scoundrels have no right to treat us so.\"    \"Yes, Tom, I'm all right as far as the electric shock is concerned, but  I don't like to be handled in this fashion.\"    \"We ought not to submit!\" burst out Mr. Damon. \"Bless the stars and  stripes! We ought to fight.\"    \"There's no chance,\" said Mr. Sharp. \"We are right under the guns of  the ship. They could sink us with one shot. I guess we'll have to give  in for the time being.\"    \"It is most unpleasant, if I may be allowed the expression,\" commented  Captain Weston mildly. He seemed to have lost his sudden anger, but  there was a steely glint in his eyes, and a grim, set look around his  month that showed his temper was kept under control only by an effort.  It boded no good to the sailors who had hold of the doughty captain if  he should once get loose, and it was noticed that they were on their  guard.    As for Tom, he submitted quietly to the two Brazilians who had hold of  either arm, and Mr. Swift was held by only one, for it was seen that he  was feeble.    \"Into the boat with them!\" cried Admiral Fanchetti. \"And guard them  well, Lieutenant Drascalo, for I heard them plotting to escape,\" and  the admiral signaled to a younger officer, who was in charge of the men  guarding the prisoners.    \"Lieutenant Drascalo, eh?\" murmured Mr. Damon. \"I think they made a  mistake naming him. It ought to be Rascalo. He looks like a rascal.\"    \"Silenceo!\" exclaimed the lieutenant, scowling at the odd character.    \"Bless my spark plug! He's a regular fire-eater!\" went on Mr. Damon,  who appeared to have fully recovered his spirits.    \"Silenceo!\" cried the lieutenant, scowling again, but Mr. Damon did not  appear to mind.    Admiral Fanchetti and several others of the gold-laced officers  remained aboard the submarine, while Tom and his friends were hustled  into the small boat and rowed toward the warship.    \"I hope they don't damage our craft,\" murmured the young inventor, as  he saw the admiral enter the conning tower.    \"If they do, we'll complain to the United States consul and demand  damages,\" said Mr. Swift.    \"I'm afraid we won't have a chance to communicate with the consul,\"  remarked Captain Weston.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Bless my shoelaces, but will  these scoundrels--\"    \"Silenceo!\" cried Lieutenant Drascalo quickly. \"Dogs of Americans, do  you wish to insult us?\"    \"Impossible; you wouldn't appreciate a good, genuine United States  insult,\" murmured Tom under his breath.    \"What I mean,\" went on the captain, \"is that these people may carry the  proceedings off with a high hand. You heard the admiral speak of a  court-martial.\"    \"Would they dare do that?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.    \"They would dare anything in this part of the world, I'm afraid,\"  resumed Captain Weston. \"I think I see their plan, though. This admiral  is newly in command; his uniform shows that. He wants to make a name for  himself, and he seizes on our submarine as an excuse. He can send word  to his government that he destroyed a torpedo craft that sought to  wreck his ship. Thus he will acquire a reputation.\"    \"But would his government support him in such a hostile act against the  United States, a friendly nation?\" asked Tom.    \"Oh, he would not claim to have acted against the United States as a  power. He would say that it was a private submarine, and, as a matter  of fact, it is. While we are under the protection of the stars and  stripes, our vessel is not a Government one,\" and Captain Weston spoke  the last in a low voice, so the scowling lieutenant could not hear.    \"What will they do with us?\" inquired Mr. Swift.    \"Have some sort of a court-martial, perhaps,\" went on the captain, \"and  confiscate our craft. Then they will send us back home, I expect for  they would not dare harm us.\"    \"But take our submarine!\" cried Tom. \"The villains--\"    \"Silenceo!\" shouted Lieutenant Drascalo and he drew his sword.    By this time the small boat was under the big guns of the San Paulo,  and the prisoners were ordered, in broken English, to mount a companion  ladder that hung over the side. In a short time they were on deck, amid  a crowd of sailors, and they could see the boat going back to bring off  the admiral, who signaled from the submarine. Tom and his friends were  taken below to a room that looked like a prison, and there, a little  later, they were visited by Admiral Fanchetti and several officers.    \"You will be tried at once,\" said the admiral. \"I have examined your  submarine and I find she carries two torpedo tubes. It is a wonder you  did not sink me at once.\"    \"Those are not torpedo tubes!\" cried Tom, unable to keep silent, though  Captain Weston motioned him to do so.    \"I know torpedo tubes when I see them,\" declared the admiral. \"I  consider I had a very narrow escape. Your country is fortunate that  mine does not declare war against it for this act. But I take it you  are acting privately, for you fly no flag, though you claim to be from  the United States.\"    \"There's no place for a flag on the submarine,\" went on Tom. \"What good  would it be under water?\"    \"Silenceo!\" cried Lieutenant Drascalo, the admonition to silence  seeming to be the only command of which he was capable.    \"I shall confiscate your craft for my government,\" went on the admiral,  \"and shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#19)"],[1,"was the struggle that began now between Zenda and  Tarlenheim. When I look back on the time, I seem to myself to have been  half mad. Sapt has told me that I suffered no interference and listened  to no remonstrances; and if ever a King of Ruritania ruled like a  despot, I was, in those days, the man. Look where I would, I saw nothing  that made life sweet to me, and I took my life in my hand and carried it  carelessly as a man dangles an old glove. At first they strove to guard  me, to keep me safe, to persuade me not to expose myself; but when they  saw how I was set, there grew up among them--whether they knew the truth  or not--a feeling that Fate ruled the issue, and that I must be left to  play my game with Michael my own way.    Late next night I rose from table, where Flavia had sat by me, and  conducted her to the door of her apartments. There I kissed her hand,  and bade her sleep sound and wake to happy days. Then I changed my  clothes and went out. Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me with six men  and the horses. Over his saddle Sapt carried a long coil of rope, and  both were heavily armed. I had with me a short stout cudgel and a long  knife. Making a circuit, we avoided the town, and in an hour found  ourselves slowly mounting the hill that led to the Castle of Zenda. The  night was dark and very stormy; gusts of wind and spits of rain caught  us as we breasted the incline, and the great trees moaned and sighed.  When we came to a thick clump, about a quarter of a mile from the  Castle, we bade our six friends hide there with the horses. Sapt had a  whistle, and they could rejoin us in a few moments if danger came: but,  up to now, we had met no one. I hoped that Michael was still off his  guard, believing me to be safe in bed. However that might be, we gained  the top of the hill without accident, and found ourselves on the edge of  the moat where it sweeps under the road, separating the Old Castle  from it. A tree stood on the edge of the bank, and Sapt, silently and  diligently, set to make fast the rope. I stripped off my boots, took a  pull at a flask of brandy, loosened the knife in its sheath, and took  the cudgel between my teeth. Then I shook hands with my friends, not  heeding a last look of entreaty from Fritz, and laid hold of the rope. I  was going to have a look at \"Jacob's Ladder.\"    Gently I lowered myself into the water. Though the night was wild, the  day had been warm and bright, and the water was not cold. I struck out,  and began to swim round the great walls which frowned above me. I could  see only three yards ahead; I had then good hopes of not being seen,  as I crept along close under the damp, moss-grown masonry. There were  lights from the new part of the Castle on the other side, and now and  again I heard laughter and merry shouts. I fancied I recognized young  Rupert Hentzau's ringing tones, and pictured him flushed with wine.  Recalling my thoughts to the business in hand, I rested a moment. If  Johann's description were right, I must be near the window now. Very  slowly I moved; and out of the darkness ahead loomed a shape. It was  the pipe, curving from the window to the water: about four feet of its  surface were displayed; it was as big round as two men. I was about to  approach it, when I saw something else, and my heart stood still.  The nose of a boat protruded beyond the pipe on the other side; and  listening intently, I heard a slight shuffle--as of a man shifting his  position. Who was the man who guarded Michael's invention? Was he awake  or was he asleep? I felt if my knife were ready, and trod water; as  I did so, I found bottom under my feet. The foundations of the Castle  extended some fifteen inches, making a ledge; and I stood on it, out of  water from my armpits upwards. Then I crouched and peered through the  darkness under the pipe, where, curving, it left a space.    There was a man in the boat. A rifle lay by him--I saw the gleam of  the barrel. Here was the sentinel! He sat very still. I listened; he  breathed heavily, regularly, monotonously. By heaven, he slept! Kneeling  on the shelf, I drew forward under the pipe till my face was within two  feet of his. He was a big man, I saw. It was Max Holf, the brother of  Johann. My hand stole to my belt, and I drew out my knife. Of all the  deeds of my life, I love the least to think of this, and whether it were  the act of a man or a traitor I will not ask. I said to myself: \"It is  war--and the King's life is the stake.\" And I raised myself from beneath  the pipe and stood up by the boat, which lay moored by the ledge.  Holding my breath, I marked the spot and raised my arm. The great fellow  stirred. He opened his eyes--wide, wider. He gasped in terror at my  face and clutched at his rifle. I struck home. And I heard the chorus of  a love-song from the opposite bank.    Leaving him where he lay, a huddled mass, I turned to \"Jacob's Ladder.\"  My time was short. This fellow's turn of watching might be over  directly, and relief would come. Leaning over the pipe, I examined it,  from the end near the water to the topmost extremity where it passed, or  seemed to pass, through the masonry of the wall. There was no break  in it, no chink. Dropping on my knees, I tested the under side. And  my breath went quick and fast, for on this lower side, where the pipe  should have clung close to the masonry, there was a gleam of light! That  light must come from the cell of the King! I set my shoulder against the  pipe and exerted my strength. The chink widened a very, very little,  and hastily I desisted; I had done enough to show that the pipe was not  fixed in the masonry at the lower side.    Then I heard a voice--a harsh, grating voice:    \"Well, sire, if you have had enough of my society, I will leave you to  repose; but I must fasten the little ornaments first.\"    It was Detchard! I caught the English accent in a moment.    \"Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?\"    The King's voice followed. It was his, though it was faint and  hollow--different from the merry tones I had heard in the glades of the  forest.    \"Pray my brother,\" said the King, \"to kill me. I am dying by inches  here.\"    \"The duke does not desire your death, sire--yet,\" sneered Detchard;  \"when he does behold your path to heaven!\"    The King answered:    \"So be it! And now, if your orders allow it, pray leave me.\"    \"May you dream of paradise!\" said the ruffian.    The light disappeared. I heard the bolts of the door run home. And then  I heard the sobs of the King. He was alone, as he thought. Who dares  mock at him?    I did not venture to speak to him. The risk of some exclamation escaping  him in surprise was too great. I dared do nothing that night; and my  task now was to get myself away in safety, and to carry off the carcass  of the dead man. To leave him there would tell too much. Casting loose  the boat, I got in. The wind was blowing a gale now, and there was  little danger of oars being heard. I rowed swiftly round to where my  friends waited. I had just reached the spot, when a loud whistle sounded  over the moat behind me.    \"Hullo, Max!\" I heard shouted.    I hailed Sapt in a low tone. The rope came down. I tied it round the  corpse, and then went up it myself.    \"Whistle you too,\" I whispered, \"for our men, and haul in the line. No  talk now.\"    They hauled up the body. Just as it reached the road, three men on  horseback swept round from the front of the Castle. We saw them; but,  being on foot ourselves, we escaped their notice. But we heard our men  coming up with a shout.    \"The devil, but it's dark!\" cried a ringing voice.    It was young Rupert. A moment later, shots rang out. Our people had met  them. I started forward at a run, Sapt and Fritz following me.    \"Thrust, thrust!\" cried Rupert again, and a loud groan following told  that he himself was not behind-hand.    \"I'm done, Rupert!\" cried a voice. \"They're three to one. Save  yourself!\"    I ran on, holding my cudgel in my hand. Suddenly a horse came towards  me. A man was on it, leaning over his shoulder.    \"Are you cooked too, Krafstein?\" he cried.    There was no answer.    I sprang to the horse's head. It was Rupert Hentzau.    \"At last!\" I cried.    For we seemed to have him. He had only his sword in his hand. My men  were hot upon him; Sapt and Fritz were running up. I had outstripped  them; but if they got close enough to fire, he must die or surrender.    \"At last!\" I cried.    \"It's the play-actor!\" cried he, slashing at my cudgel. He cut it clean  in two; and, judging discretion better than death, I ducked my head  and (I blush to tell it) scampered for my life. The devil was in Rupert  Hentzau; for he put spurs to his horse, and I, turning to look, saw him  ride, full gallop, to the edge of the moat and leap in, while the shots  of our party fell thick round him like hail. With one gleam of moonlight  we should have riddled him with balls; but, in the darkness, he won to  the corner of the Castle, and vanished from our sight.    \"The deuce take him!\" grinned Sapt.    \"It's a pity,\" said I, \"that he's a villain. Whom have we got?\"    We had Lauengram and Krafstein: they lay dead; and, concealment being  no longer possible, we flung them, with Max, into the moat; and, drawing  together in a compact body, rode off down the hill. And, in our midst,  went the bodies of three gallant gentlemen. Thus we travelled home,  heavy at heart for the death of our friends, sore uneasy concerning  the King, and cut to the quick that young Rupert had played yet another  winning hand with us.    For my own part, I was vexed and angry that I had killed no man in open  fight, but only stabbed a knave in his sleep. And I did not love to hear  Rupert call me a play-actor.
