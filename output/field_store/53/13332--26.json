It was a freak of mine. My  favorite one was a knotted beech stick, and I carved the head myself.  There's a mighty amount of character in sticks. Don't you think so? You  have seen these fishing poles that fit into a cane? Well, that was an  old idea of mine. Dogwood clubs were favorite ones with the boys. I  'spose they use'em yet. Hickory is too heavy, unless you get it from a  young sapling. Have you ever noticed how a stick in one's hand will  change his appearance? Old women and witches would'nt look so without  sticks. Meg Merrilies understands that.\"    In this way my friend, who is a clerk, in a newspaper office, heard the  President talk for an hour. The undress of the man and the witness of  his subject would be staples for merriment if we did not reflect that  his greatness was of no conventional cast, that the playfulness of his  nature and the simplicity of his illustration lightened public business  but never arrested it.    Another gentleman, whom I know, visited the President in high dudgeon  one night. He was a newspaper proprietor and one of his editors had been  arrested.    \"Mr. Lincoln,\" he said, \"I have been off electioneering for your  re-election, and in my absence you have had my editor arrested. I won't  stand it, sir. I have fought better administrations than yours.\"    \"Why, John,\" said the President, \"I don't know much about it. I suppose  your boys have been too enterprizing. The fact is, I don't interfere  with the press much, but I suppose I am responsible.\"    \"I want you to order the man's release to-night,\" said the applicant. \"I  shan't leave here till I get it. In fact, I am the man who should be  arrested. Why don't you send me to Capitol Hill?\"    This idea pleased the President exceedingly. He laughed the other into  good humor.    \"In fact,\" he said, \"I am under restraint here, and glad of any pretext  to release a journalist.\"    So he wrote the order, and the writer got his liberty.    It must not be inferred from this, however, that the President was a  devotee to literature. He had no professional enthusiasm for it. The  literary coterie of the White House got little flattery but its members  were treated as agreeable citizens and not as the architects of any  body's fortune.    Willis went there much for awhile, but yielded to his old habit of  gossiping about the hall paper and the teapots. Emerson went there once,  and was deferred to us if he were anything but a philosopher. Yet he so  far grasped the character of his host as to indite that noble  humanitarian eulogy upon him, delivered at Concord, and printed in the  WORLD. It will not do to say definitely In this notice how several  occasional writers visited the White House, heard the President's views  and assented to them and afterward abused him. But these attained no  remembrance nor tart reproach from that least retaliatory of men. He  harbored no malice, and is said to have often placed himself on the  stand-point of Davis and Lee, and accounted for their defection while he  could not excuse it.    He was a good reader, and took all the leading NEW YORK dailies every  day. His secretaries perused them and selected all the items which would  interest the President; these were read to him and considered. He bought  few new books, but seemed ever alive to works of comic value; the vein  of humor in him was not boisterous in its manifestations, but touched  the geniality of his nature, and he reproduced all that he absorbed, to  elucidate some new issue, or turn away argument by a laugh.    As a jester, Mr. Lincoln's tendency was caricatured by the prints, but  not exaggerated. He probably told as many stories as are attributed to  him. Nor did he, as is averred, indulge in these jests on solemn  occasions. No man felt with such personal intensity the extent of the  casualties of his time, and he often gravely reasoned whether he could  be in any way responsible for the bloodshed and devastation over which  it was his duty to preside.    An acquaintance of mine--a private--once went to him to plead for a  man's life. He had never seen the man for whom he pleaded, and had no  acquaintance with the man's family. Mr. Lincoln was touched by his  disinterestedness, and said to him:    \"If I were anything but the President, I would be constantly working as  you have done.\"    Whenever a doubt of one's guilt lay on his mind, the man was spared by  his direct interference..    There was an entire absence in the President's character of the heroic  element. He would do a great deed in _deshabille_ as promptly as in full  dress. He never aimed to be brilliant, unconsciously understanding that  a great man's brilliancy is to be measured by the \"wholeness\" and  synthetic cast of his career rather than by any fitful ebullitions. For  that reason we look in vain through his messages for \"points.\" His point  was not to turn a sentence or an epigram, but to win an effect,  regardless of the route to it.    He was commonplace in his talk, and Chesterfield would have had no  patience with him; his dignity of character lay in his uprightness  rather than in his formal manner. Members of his government often  reviewed him plainly in his presence. Yet he divined the true course,  while they only argued it out.    His good feeling was not only personal, but national. He had no  prejudice against any race or potentate. And his democracy was of a  practical, rather than of a demonstrative, nature. He was not Marat, but  Moreau--not Paine and Jefferson; but Franklin.    His domestic life was like a parlor of night-time, lit by the equal  grate of his genial and uniform kindness. Young Thaddy played with him  upon the carpet; Robert came home from the war and talked to his father  as to a school-mate, he was to Mrs. Lincoln as chivalrous on the last  day of his life as when he courted her. I have somewhere seen a picture  of Henry IV. of France, riding his babies on his back: that was the  President.    So dwelt the citizen who is gone--a model in character if not in  ceremony, for good men to come who will take his place in the same White  House, and find their generation comparing them to the man thought  worthy of assassination. I am glad to sit here in his chair, where he  has bent so often,--in the atmosphere of the household he purified, in  the sight of the green grass and the blue river he hallowed by gazing  upon, in the very centre of the nation he preserved for the people, and  close the list of bloody deeds, of desperate fights of swift expiations,  of renowned obsequies of which I have written, by inditing at his table  the goodness of his life and the eternity of his memory.          LETTER VIII.    THE TRIAL.      Washington, May 26.    The most exciting trial of our times has obtained a very meager  commemoration in all but its literal features. The evidence adduced in  the course of it, has been too faithfully reported, through its  far-fetched and monotonous irregularities, but nobody realizes the  extraordinary scene from which so many columns emanate, either by aid of  the reporters' scanty descriptions, or by the purblind sketches of the  artists.    Now that the evidence is growing vapid, and the obstinacy of the  military commission has lost its coarse zest, we may find enough readers  to warrant a fuller sketch of the conspirators' prison.    About a mile below Washington, where the high Potomac Bluffs meet the  marshy border of the Eastern branch, stands the United States arsenal, a  series of long, mathematically uninteresting brick buildings, with a  broad lawn behind them, open to the water, and level military plazas, on  which are piled pyramids of shell and ball, among acres of cannon and  cannon-carriages, and caissons. A high wall, reaching circularly around  these buildings, shows above it, as one looks from Washington, the  barred windows of an older and more gloomy structure than the rest,  which forms the city front of the group of which it is the principal.  This was a penitentiary, but, long ago added to the arsenal, it has been  re-transformed to a court-room and jail, and in its third, or uppermost  story, the Military Commission is sitting.    The main road to the arsenal is by a wide and vacant avenue, which abuts  against a gate where automaton sentries walk, but the same gate can best  be reached on foot by the shores of the Potomac, in the sight, of the  forts, the shipping, and Alexandria.    The scene at the arsenal in time of peace is common-place enough, except  that across the Eastern Branch the towers of the lunatic asylum, perched  upon a height, look down baronially; but this trial of murderers has  made the spot a fair.    A whole company of volunteers keeps the gate, through which are passing  cabs, barouches, officers' ambulances, and a stream of folks on foot;  while farther along almost a regiment crosses the drive, their huddled  shelter tents extending entirely across the peninsula. These are playing  cards on the ground, and tossing quoits, and sleeping on their faces,  while a gunboat watches the river front, and under a circular wall a  line of patrols, ten yards apart, go to and fro perpetually.    It is 10 o'clock, and the court is soon to sit. Its members ride down in  superb ambulances and bring their friends along to show them the majesty  of justice. A perfect park of carriages stands by the door to the left,  and from these dismount major-generals' wives, in rustling silks;  daughters of congressmen, attired like the lilies of the milliner;  little girls who hope to be young ladies and have come with \"Pa,\" to  look at the assassins; even brides are here, in the fresh blush of their  nuptials, and they consider the late spectacle of the review as good as  lost, if the court-scene be not added to it. These tender creatures have  a weakness for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#19)"],[1," of negative particles shot away from the sun. In its details  the hypothesis of Arrhenius also affords an explanation of many  peculiarities of the Zodiacal Light, such as that it is confined to  the neighborhood of the ecliptic, and that it is stronger on the side  of the earth which is just turning away from a position under the sun  than on the other side; but it would carry us beyond our limits to go  into these particulars. The Gegenschein, according to this theory, is  a part of the same phenomenon as the Zodiacal Light, for by the laws  of perspective it is evident that the reflection from the streams of  particles situated at a point directly opposite to the sun would be at  a maximum, and this is the place which the Gegenschein occupies. Apart  from its geometrical relations to the position of the sun, the  variability of the Zodiacal Light appears to affirm its solar  dependence, and this too would be accounted for by Arrhenius'  hypothesis better than by the old theory of coronal extension. The  amount of corpuscular discharge from the sun must naturally be  governed by the state of relative activity or inactivity of the  latter, and this could not but be reflected in the varying splendor of  the Zodiacal Light. But much more extended study than has yet been  given to the subject will be required before we can feel that we know  with reasonable certainty what this mysterious phenomenon really is.  By the hypothesis of Arrhenius every planet that has an atmosphere  must have a Zodiacal Light attending it, but the phenomenon is too  faint for us to be able to see it in the case, for instance, of Venus,  whose atmosphere is very abundant. The moon has no corresponding  ``comet's tail'' because, as already explained, of the lack of a lunar  atmosphere to repel the streams by becoming itself electrified; but if  there were a lunar Zodiacal Light, no doubt we could see it because of  the relative nearness of our satellite.    Marvels of the Aurora    One of the most vivid recollections of my early boyhood is that of  seeing my father return hastily into the house one evening and call  out to the family: ``Come outside and look at the sky!'' Ours was a  country house situated on a commanding site, and as we all emerged  from the doorway we were dumbfounded to see the heavens filled with  pale flames which ran licking and quivering over the stars. Instantly  there sprang into my terrified mind the recollection of an awful  description of ``the Day of Judgment'' (the Dies Irae), which I had  heard with much perturbation of spirit in the Dutch Reformed church  from the lips of a tall, dark-browed, dreadfully-in-earnest preacher  of the old-fashioned type. My heart literally sank at sight of the  spectacle, for it recalled the preacher's very words; it was just as  he had said it would be, and it needed the assured bearing of my  elders finally to convince me that      That Day of Wrath, O dreadful day,    When Heaven and Earth shall pass away,    As David and the Sibyl say    had not actually come upon us. And even the older members of the  household were not untouched with misgivings when menacing spots of  crimson appeared, breaking out now here, now there, in the shuddering  sky. Toward the north the spectacle was appalling. A huge arch spanned  an unnaturally dark segment resting on the horizon, and above this  arch sprang up beams and streamers in a state of incessant agitation,  sometimes shooting up to the zenith with a velocity that took one's  breath, and sometimes suddenly falling into long ranks, and marching,  marching, marching, like an endless phalanx of fiery specters, and  moving, as I remember, always from east to west. The absolute silence  with which these mysterious evolutions were performed and the  quavering reflections which were thrown upon the ground increased the  awfulness of the exhibition. Occasionally enormous curtains of lambent  flame rolled and unrolled with a majestic motion, or were shaken to  and fro as if by a mighty, noiseless wind. At times, too, a sudden  billowing rush would be made toward the zenith, and for a minute the  sky overhead would glow so brightly that the stars seemed to have been  consumed. The spectacle continued with varying intensity for hours.    This exhibition occurred in Central New York, a latitude in which the  Aurora Borealis is seldom seen with so much splendor. I remember  another similar one seen from the city of New York in November, 1882.  On this last occasion some observers saw a great upright beam of light  which majestically moved across the heavens, stalking like an  apparition in the midst of the auroral pageant, of whose general  movements it seemed to be independent, maintaining always its upright  posture, and following a magnetic parallel from east to west. This  mysterious beam was seen by no less than twenty-six observers in  different parts of the country, and a comparison of their observations  led to a curious calculation indicating that the apparition was about  one hundred and thirty-three miles tall and moved at the speed of ten  miles per second!    But, as everybody knows, it is in the Arctic regions that the Aurora,  or the ``Northern Lights,'' can best be seen. There, in the long polar  night, when for months together the sun does not rise, the strange  coruscations in the sky often afford a kind of spectral daylight in  unison with the weird scenery of the world of ice. The pages in the  narratives of Arctic exploration that are devoted to descriptions of  the wonderful effects of the Northern Lights are second to none that  man has ever penned in their fascination. The lights, as I have  already intimated, display astonishing colors, particularly shades of  red and green, as they flit from place to place in the sky. The  discovery that the magnetic needle is affected by the Aurora,  quivering and darting about in a state of extraordinary excitement  when the lights are playing in the sky, only added to the mystery of  the phenomenon until its electro-magnetic nature had been established.  This became evident as soon as it was known that the focus of the  displays was the magnetic pole; and when the far South was visited the  Aurora Australis was found, having its center at the South Magnetic  Pole. Then, if not before, it was clear that the earth was a great  globular magnet, having its poles of opposite magnetism, and that the  auroral lights, whatever their precise cause might be, were  manifestations of the magnetic activity of our planet. After the  invention of magnetic telegraphy it was found that whenever a great  Aurora occurred the telegraph lines were interrupted in their  operation, and the ocean cables ceased to work. Such a phenomenon is  called a ``magnetic storm.''    The interest excited by the Aurora in scientific circles was greatly  stimulated when, in the last half of the nineteenth century, it was  discovered that it is a phenomenon intimately associated with  disturbances on the sun. The ancient ``Zurich Chronicles,'' extending  from the year 1000 to the year 1800, in which both sun-spots visible  to the naked eye and great displays of the auroral lights were  recorded, first set Rudolf Wolf on the track of this discovery. The  first notable proof of the suspected connection was furnished with  dramatic emphasis by an occurrence which happened on September 1,  1859. Near noon on that day two intensely brilliant points suddenly  broke out in a group of sun-spots which were under observation by Mr  R. C. Carrington at his observatory at Redhill, England. The points  remained visible for not more than five minutes, during which interval  they moved thirty-five thousand miles across the solar disk. Mr R.  Hodgson happened to see the same phenomenon at his observatory at  Highgate, and thus all possibility of deception was removed. But  neither of the startled observers could have anticipated what was to  follow, and, indeed, it was an occurrence which has never been  precisely duplicated. I quote the eloquent account given by Miss  Clerke in her History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century.      This unique phenomenon seemed as if specially designed to    accentuate the inference of a sympathetic relation between the    earth and the sun. From August 28 to September 4, 1859, a magnetic    storm of unparalleled intensity, extent, and duration was in    progress over the entire globe. Telegraphic communication was    everywhere interrupted -- except, indeed, that it was in some cases    found practicable to work the lines without batteries by the agency    of the earth-currents alone; sparks issued from the wires; gorgeous    auroras draped the skies in solemn crimson over both hemispheres,    and even in the tropics; the magnetic needle lost all trace of    continuity in its movements and darted to and fro as if stricken    with inexplicable panic. The coincidence was even closer. At the    very instant of the solar outburst witnessed by Carrington and    Hodgson the photographic apparatus at Kew registered a marked    disturbance of all the three magnetic elements; while shortly after    the ensuing midnight the electric agitation culminated, thrilling    the whole earth with subtle vibrations, and lighting up the    atmosphere from pole to pole with coruscating splendors which    perhaps dimly recall the times when our ancient planet itself shone    as a star.    If this amazing occurrence stood alone, and as I have already said it  has never been exactly duplicated, doubt might be felt concerning some  of the inferences drawn from it; but in varying forms it has been  repeated many times, so that now hardly anyone questions the reality  of the assumed connection between solar outbursts and magnetic storms  accompanied by auroral displays on the earth. It is true that the late  Lord Kelvin raised difficulties in the way of the hypothesis of a  direct magnetic action of the sun upon the"]]]
