And I'm a  poorer man than Macy Cameron an' less able to give.\"    The tone and the words were both cruel--or seemed to be to Ruth's  mind. But she said, bravely:    \"People know that you're my uncle--\"    \"I was yer mother's uncle; that's all. The relationship ain't much,\"  declared Uncle Jabez.    \"Jabez,\" said the little old woman, solemnly, \"you've been a good  friend to me--ye've borne with me in sickness and in weakness. Ye  took me from the a'mshouse when I didn't have a penny to my name and  nobody else to turn to, it seemed. I've tried ter do for ye  faithfully. But I ain't done my duty by you no more than this child  here has since she's come here to the Red Mill. You know that well  yourself, too. Don't blame the pretty leetle creetur for havin' the  nateral vanity that all young things hez. Remember, Jabez, that it was  through you that she has had to accept clothing from outsiders.\"    \"Through me?\" growled the miller, raising his countenance and scowling  at the brave old woman--for it took courage for Aunt Alvirah to speak  to him in this way.    \"Helen Cam'ron wouldn't have been called on to give Ruthie her frocks  which she only wore last year, and outgrew, if you hadn't lost  Ruthie's trunk. Ye know that, Jabez,\" urged Aunt Alvirah.    \"I s'pose I'm never to hear the last of that!\" stormed the miller.    \"You are still to hear the first word from Ruthie about it, Jabez,\"  admonished his housekeeper.    \"Well!\"    \"Well,\" repeated Aunt Alvirah, still speaking quietly but earnestly.  \"You know it ain't my way to interfere in your affairs, Jabez. But  right is right. It was you lost Ruthie's trunk. I never knew ye ter be  dishonest--\"    \"What's that?\" gasped Mr. Potter, the red mantling his gray cheek  dully.    \"I never knew ye ter do a dishonest thing afore, Jabez,\" pursued Aunt  Alvirah, with her voice shaking now. \"But it's dishonest for ye to  never even perpose ter make good what ye lost. If you'd lost a sack of  grain for a neighbor ye'd made it up to him; wouldn't ye?\"    \"What's thet gotter do with a lot of foolish fal-lals an' rigamagigs  belonging to a gal that I've taken in--\"    \"To help us. And she does help us,\" declared the old woman, quickly.  \"She more'n airns her keep, Jabez. Ye know she does.\"    \"Well!\" grunted the miller again, but he actually looked somewhat  abashed and dropped his gaze to the ledger.    \"Well, then, Jabez Potter,\" said the old housekeeper, \"you think it  over--think it over, Jabez. And as sure as my name's Alviry Boggs, if  you do think it over, something will come of it!\"    This seemed like a rather mysterious saying, and there seemed to be  nothing for the miller to observe in answer to it. Ruth had ere this  dried her eyes and it was soon bedtime. It is a long time from Friday  night to Monday morning--especially to young folk. The hurt that Ruth  had felt over Julia Semple's unkind words had lost its keenness in  Ruth's mind ere school began again. So Ruth took up her school duties  quite as usual, wearing one of the pretty frocks in which, however,  she could no longer take such pride and delight.    There was really nothing for her to do but wear them. She realized  that. She felt, however, that whenever any girl looked at her she  remembered that it was Helen Cameron's cast-off dress she wore; so she  was glad that the big girls were no more friendly than before and that  they seldom looked at her.    Besides, all the school was very busy now. In a fortnight would came  graduation. About all Ruth heard at recess and between sessions, even  among the smaller girls, was the discussion of what they were to wear  on the last day of the term. It was a great day at this school, and  Miss Cramp was to graduate from her care seven pupils--four girls and  three boys--all of whom would go to the Cheslow High the coming year.  Ruth would not be ready to graduate; but before fall, if she was  faithful to the tasks Miss Cramp set her, that kind teacher assured  the girl from the Red Mill that she would be able to enter the higher  school with this graduating class.    All the older girls and many of the others were to wear white. Miss  Cramp approved of this, for even a simple white dress would look  pretty and nice and was within the means of most of the girl pupils.  Nobody asked Ruth what she would wear; and she was glad of that, for  she knew that she had no choice but to don the shabby black cloth  frock she had worn at first, or one of the \"charity\" frocks.    In this first week after the spelling-bee she did not see Helen or  Tom, and only received a brief note from Helen which she tried to  answer with her usual cheerfulness. Helen and Tom were going to the  city for a few days, therefore Ruth was not likely to see either until  the end of the term.    At the Red Mill matters went much the same as usual. If Uncle Jabez  had taken to heart anything that Aunt Alvirah had said, he did not  show it. He was as moody as ever and spoke no more to Ruth than  before. But once or twice the girl found him looking at her with a  puzzled frown which she did not understand.    On Saturday, however, at dinner, Mr. Potter said: \"Alviry, if the gal  has got her work done she can go to town with me this afternoon.\"    Ruth shrank a little and looked appealingly at the old woman. But Aunt  Alvirah would not or did not, understand Ruth's pleading, and said,  briskly:    \"She shall be ready when you've shaved and Ben's harnessed the mules,  Jabez.\"    \"Oh, Auntie!\" whispered Ruth, when the miller had gone out, \"I don't  want to go with him! I don't really!\"    \"Now, don't say that, child,\" said Aunt Alvirah. \"Don't do nothing to  make him feel that ye air afraid of him. Go 'long. Ye can call on that  leetle lame gal ye was tellin' us about while Jabez does his errands.  Now hurry, deary.\"    Ruth felt quite confused by this. It seemed that there must be some  private understanding between Aunt Alvirah and the miller. She went  slowly and changed her frock. The old lady, crying up the stairway  after her, advised her to look her smartest--so as to please Jabez,  forsooth! Indeed, she finally hobbled up stairs, with many  ejaculations of \"Oh, my back and oh, my bones!\" for the purpose of  satisfying herself that Ruth was as nicely dressed as she could be.    And Uncle Jabez--or no other man--need have been ashamed of the  appearance of Ruth Fielding when the mules came around hitched to the  heavy farm-wagon which Mr. Potter usually drove. It was piled high  with bags of flour and meal, which he proposed to exchange at the  Cheslow stores for such supplies as he might need. The load seemed  heavier than usual this day.    It was not a bad wagon to ride in, though dusty; for there was a  spring seat and over it a new hood to shield the riders from the sun.  Ruth followed Uncle Jabez out of the house and climbed up over the  wheel and into the seat when he nodded for her to do so. He followed  her, took up the reins, and the boy, Ben, stood away from the mules'  heads.    Aunt Alvirah stood on the porch and waved her apron at Ruth every time  the girl turned around, until the wagon had crossed the bridge and was  way up the long hill on the Cheslow road. It was a delightful June  afternoon and had Ruth been traversing this pleasant highway in almost  any other way, she would have enjoyed the ride mightily.      CHAPTER XXI     THE END OF THE TERM    But the companionship of the grim and glum proprietor of the Red Mill  was not conducive--in Ruth's case, at least--to any feeling of  pleasure. Uncle Jabez seemed about to speak to her a dozen times  before they were out of sight of the mill; but every time Ruth turned  toward him, half expecting to be addressed, his lips were grimly set  and he was looking straight ahead over the mules' ears.    It is doubtful if Uncle Jabez saw anything of the beauty of the day or  the variety of the landscape. Looking as he did he could not have  observed by his eyes of flesh much but the brown ribbon of road before  them, for miles. And it is doubtful if, spiritually, he appreciated  much of the beauty of the June day. The mules toiled up the long hill,  straining in their collars; but they began to trot upon the other side  of the ridge and the five miles to Cheslow were covered in a  comparatively short time.    Finally, when Uncle Jabez drew up before one of the largest stores,  she felt that she must break the awful silence. And stumblingly she  preferred her request:    \"If you are going to be some time trading, Uncle Jabez, can't I go  down to call on Mercy Curtis? I can come here again and meet you at  any time you say.\"    \"Who's that? Sam Curtis' gal--the cripple?\" asked Uncle Jabez,  shortly.    \"Yes, sir. She likes to have me come and see her.\"    \"Can't you find nothing more interestin' to do when ye come to town  than go to see a sick gal?\" was the miller's surprising inquiry.    \"I--I promised to call on her if I could whenever I was in town. She  really likes to have me come,\" explained Ruth.    \"Well, you can go,\" grunted Uncle Jabez. \"I'll stop there for ye when  I'm done tradin'.\"    He had already climbed down from the high seat. Ruth came lightly down  after him and he actually turned and jumped her over the wheel so that  her dress should not be soiled. Then, suddenly, he said:    \"Wait. I want you to go into this store with me first.\"    He turned away abruptly, so that Ruth could not see what his  countenance expressed. He carefully tied his mules to a hitching post  and then stumped into the store without again glancing in her  direction. Ruth followed him timidly.    It was a big store with many departments, and on one side were dry  goods and clothing, where the clerks were women, or young girls, while  the groceries, provisions, hardware and agricultural tools were  displayed upon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#19)"],[1,"spot where the two  young men stood behind the bushes.    \"He's seen us,\" whispered Ned.    \"Yes,\" assented Tom.  \"And it's a perfect shot.  Hope I don't miss!\"    It was not like Tom Swift to miss, nor did he on this occasion.  There  was a slight report from the electric rifle--a report not unlike the  crackle of the wireless--and the powerful projectile sped true to its  mark.    Straight through the throat and chest under the uplifted jaw of the  jaguar it went--through heart and lungs.  Then with a great coughing,  sighing snarl the beast reared up, gave a convulsive leap forward  toward its newly discovered enemies, and fell dead in a limp heap, just  beyond the native over which it had been crouching before it delivered  the death stroke, now never to fall.    \"You did it, Tom! You did it!\" cried Ned, springing up from where he  had been kneeling to give his chum a better chance to shoot.  \"You did  it, and saved the man's life!\" And Ned would have rushed out toward the  still twitching body.    \"Just a minute!\" interposed Tom.  \"Those beasts sometimes have as many  lives as a cat.  I'll give it one more for luck.\"  Another electric  projectile through the head of the jaguar produced no further effect  than to move the body slightly, and this proved conclusively that there  was no life left.  It was safe to approach, which Tom and Ned did.    Their first thought, after a glance at the jaguar, was for the Indian.  It needed but a brief examination to show that he was not badly hurt.  The jaguar had leaped on him from a low tree as he passed under it, as  the boys learned afterward, and had crushed the man to earth by the  weight of the spotted body more than by a stroke of the paw.    The American jaguar is not so formidable a beast as the native name of  tiger would cause one to suppose, though they are sufficiently  dangerous, and this one had rather badly clawed the Indian.  Fortunately the scratches were on the fleshy parts of the arms and  shoulders, where, though painful, they were not necessarily serious.    \"But if you hadn't shot just when you did, Tom, it would have been all  up with him,\" commented Ned.    \"Oh, well, I guess you'd have hit him if I hadn't,\" returned the young  inventor.  \"But let's see what we can do for this chap.\"    The man sat up wonderingly--hardly able to believe that he had been  saved from the dreaded \"tigre.\"  His wounds were bleeding rather  freely, and as Tom and Ned carried with them a first-aid kit they now  brought it into use.  The wounds were bound up, the man was given water  to drink and then, as he was able to walk, Tom and Ned offered to help  him wherever he wanted to go.    \"Blessed if I can tell whether he's one of our Indians or whether he  belongs to the Beecher crowd,\" remarked Tom.    \"Senor Beecher,\" said the Indian, adding, in Spanish, that he lived in  the vicinity and had only lately been engaged by the young professor  who hoped to discover the idol of gold before Tom's scientific friend  could do so.    Tom and Ned knew a little Spanish, and with that, and simple but  expressive signs on the part of the Indian, they learned his story.  He  had his palm-thatched hut not far from the Beecher camp, in a small  Indian village, and he, with others, had been hired on the arrival of  the Beecher party to help with the excavations.  These, for some  reason, were delayed.    \"Delayed because they daren't use the map they stole from us,\"  commented Ned.    \"Maybe,\" agreed Tom.    The Indian, whose name, it developed, was Tal, as nearly as Tom and Ned  could master it, had left camp to go to visit his wife and child in the  jungle hut, intending to return to the Beecher camp at night.  But as  he passed through the forest the jaguar had dropped on him, bearing him  to earth.    \"But you saved my life, Senor,\" he said to Tom, dropping on one knee  and trying to kiss Tom's hand, which our hero avoided.  \"And now my  life is yours,\" added the Indian.    \"Well, you'd better get home with it and take care of it,\" said Tom.  \"I'll have Professor Bumper come over and dress your scratches in a  better and more careful way.  The bandages we put on are only  temporary.\"    \"My wife she make a poultice of leaves--they cure me,\" said the Indian.    \"I guess that will be the best way,\" observed Ned.  \"These natives can  doctor themselves for some things, better than we can.\"    \"Well, we'll take him home,\" suggested Tom.  \"He might keel over from  loss of blood.  Come on,\" he added to Tal, indicating his object.    It was not far to the native's hut from the place where the jaguar had  been killed, and there Tom and Ned underwent another demonstration of  affection as soon as those of Tal's immediate family and the other  natives understood what had happened.    \"I hate this business!\" complained Tom, after having been knelt to by  the Indian's wife and child, who called him the \"preserver\" and other  endearing titles of the same kind.  \"Come on, let's hike back.\"    But Indian hospitality, especially after a life has been saved, is not  so simple as all that.    \"My life--my house--all that I own is yours,\" said Tal in deep  gratitude.  \"Take everything,\" and he waved his hand to indicate all  the possessions in his humble hut.    \"Thanks,\" answered Tom, \"but I guess you need all you have.  That's a  fine specimen of blow gun though,\" he added, seeing one hanging on the  wall.  \"I wouldn't mind having one like that.  If you get well enough  to make me one, Tal, and some arrows to go with it, I'd like it for a  curiosity to hang in my room at home.\"    \"The Senor shall have a dozen,\" promised the Indian.    \"Look, Ned,\" went on Tom, pointing to the native weapon.  \"I never saw  one just like this.  They use small arrows or darts, tipped with wild  cotton, instead of feathers.\"    \"These the arrows,\" explained Tal's wife, bringing a bundle from a  corner of the one-room hut.  As she held them out her husband gave a  cry of fear.    \"Poisoned arrows! Poisoned arrows!\" he exclaimed.  \"One scratch and the  senors are dead men.  Put them away!\"    In fear the Indian wife prepared to obey, but as she did so Tom Swift  caught sight of the package and uttered a strange cry.    \"Thundering hoptoads, Ned!\" he exclaimed.  \"The poisoned arrows are  wrapped in the piece of oiled silk that was around the professor's  missing map!\"          CHAPTER XX    AN OLD LEGEND      Fascinated, Tom and Ned gazed at the package the Indian woman held out  to them.  Undoubtedly it was oiled silk on the outside, and through the  almost transparent covering could be seen the small arrows, or darts,  used in the blow gun.    \"Where did you get that?\" asked Tom, pointing to the bundle and gazing  sternly at Tal.    \"What is the matter, Senor?\" asked the Indian in turn.  \"Is it that you  are afraid of the poisoned arrows?  Be assured they will not harm you  unless you are scratched by them.\"    Tom and Ned found it difficult to comprehend all the rapid Spanish  spoken by their host, but they managed to understand some, and his  eloquent gestures made up the rest.    \"We're not afraid,\" Tom said, noting that the oiled skin well covered  the dangerous darts.  \"But where did you get that?\"    \"I picked it up, after another Indian had thrown it away.  He got it in  your camp, Senor.  I will not lie to you.  I did not steal.  Valdez  went to your camp to steal--he is a bad Indian--and he brought back  this wrapping.  It contained something he thought was gold, but it was  not, so he----\"    \"Quick! Yes! Tell us!\" demanded Tom eagerly.  \"What did he do with the  professor's map that was in the oiled silk?  Where is it?\"    \"Oh, Senors!\" exclaimed the Indian woman, thinking perhaps her husband  was about to be dealt harshly with when she heard Tom's excited voice.  \"Tal do no harm!\"    \"No, he did no harm,\" went on Tom, in a reassuring tone.  \"But he can  do a whole lot of good if he tells us what became of the map that was  in this oiled silk.  Where is it?\" he asked again.    \"Valdez burn it up,\" answered Tal.    \"What, burned the professor's map?\" cried Ned.    \"If that was in this yellow cloth--yes,\" answered the injured man.  \"Valdez he is bad.  He say to me he is going to your camp to see what  he can take.  How he got this I know not, but he come back one morning  with the yellow package.  I see him, but he make me promise not to  tell.  But you save my life I tell you everything.    \"Valdez open the package; but it is not gold, though he think so  because it is yellow, and the man with no hair on his head keep it in  his pocket close, so close,\" and Tal hugged himself to indicate what he  meant.    \"That's Professor Bumper,\" explained Ned.    \"How did Valdez get the map out of the professor's coat?\" asked Tom.    \"Valdez he very much smart.  When man with no hair on his head take  coat off for a minute to eat breakfast Valdez take yellow thing out of  pocket.\"    \"The Indian must have sneaked into camp when we were eating,\" said Tom.  \"Those from Beecher's party and our workers look all alike to us.  We  wouldn't know one from the other, and one of our rival's might slip in.\"    \"One evidently did, if this is really the piece of oiled silk that was  around the professor's map,\" said Ned.    \"It certainly is the same,\" declared the young inventor.  \"See, there  is his name,\" and he stretched out his hand to point.    \"Don't touch!\" cried Tal.  \"Poisoned arrows snake poison--very  dead-like and quick.\"    \"Don't worry, I won't touch,\" said Tom grimly.  \"But go on.  You say  Valdez sneaked into our camp, took the oiled-silk package from the coat  pocket of Professor Bumper and went back to his own camp with it,  thinking it was gold.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tal, though it is doubtful if he understood all that  Tom said, as it was half Spanish and half English.  But the Indian knew  a little English, too.  \"Valdez, when he find no gold is very mad.  Only papers in the yellow silk-papers with queer marks "]]]
