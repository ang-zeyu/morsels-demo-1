BEETS.--For canning, select small, young beets. Prepare them by  cutting off the tops, which may be cooked as greens or canned  separately, and all but about an inch of the stems and an inch of the  roots. Scrub the trimmed beets well, and then blanch them in boiling  water for 5 to 15 minutes or until the skins may be easily scraped off  with a knife. Plunge them quickly into cold water and draw them out  again. Then scrape off the skins and remove the roots and stems. The  roots and stems are left on during the blanching and cold-dipping to  prevent them from bleeding, or losing color. When thus prepared, pack  the beets into jars, add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful, and fill  the jars with boiling water. Then adjust the jar tops and proceed to  sterilize and cook the jars of beets according to the directions for any  preferred method. In the water bath, cook them for 1-1/2 hours; in the  pressure cooker, cook them for 1 hour at a pressure of 5 pounds or for  40 minutes at a pressure of 10 pounds.    67. CARROTS, PARSNIPS, AND TURNIPS.--Young parsnips and turnips are  canned in exactly the same way as young carrots. Therefore, directions  for the canning of carrots will suffice for all three of these  vegetables. Prepare the carrots for canning by cutting off the tops and  the roots and scrubbing them well. Blanch them for 10 to 15 minutes in  boiling water, so that the skins may be easily removed, and cold-dip  them. Then remove the skins by scraping, pack the carrots into the jars,  add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful, and fill the jars with boiling  water. Adjust the jar tops next, and proceed to sterilize and cook the  jars of carrots according to the method selected. In the water bath,  cook for 1-1/2 hours; in the pressure cooker, cook for 1 hour at a  pressure of 5 pounds or for 40 minutes at a pressure of 10 pounds.      GROUP 4--SPECIAL VEGETABLES    68. Vegetables of the fourth group, which include those which cannot  well be classified in the other groups, lend themselves readily to  combinations, such as succotash, that make for variety in food. As is  true of the other vegetables, special vegetables must be fresh and sound  if good results in canning are expected.    69. LIMA AND OTHER SHELLED BEANS.--For canning, only tender beans,  whether Lima or some other variety, should be chosen. Prepare them for  immediate canning by shelling them--that is, taking them from the  pods--blanching them for 5 to 10 minutes in boiling water, and then  cold-dipping them quickly. Pack the jars to within 1/2 inch of the top,  add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jar, and fill the jars with boiling  water. Adjust the covers and proceed to sterilize and cook them. In the  water bath, boil for 2-1/2 to 3 hours; in the pressure cooker, cook for  1-1/2 hours at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 1 hour at a pressure of  10 pounds.    70. GREEN CORN.--For canning purposes, only corn that is young and milky  should be selected. Get it ready for canning by husking it and removing  the silk. Then blanch it for 3 to 5 minutes in boiling water and  cold-dip it quickly. Cut the kernels half way down to the cob and scrape  out what remains after cutting. For best results in this operation, hold  the ear of corn so that the butt end is up; then cut from the tip toward  the butt, but scrape from the butt toward the tip. Next, pack the jars  tightly with the corn, pressing it into them with a wooden masher.  Unless two persons can work together, however, cut only enough corn for  one jar and fill and partly seal it before cutting more. As corn swells  in the cooking, fill each jar to within 1/2 inch of the top. The milk in  the corn should fill all spaces between the kernels, provided there are  any, but if it does not, boiling water may be poured in. Add 1  teaspoonful of salt to each jarful of corn and adjust the jar lids. Boil  for 3 hours in the water bath; but, if the pressure cooker is to be  used, cook for 1-1/2 hours at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 1 hour at a  pressure of 10 pounds.    Corn on the cob may be canned in the same way if desired, but as only  three small ears can be put into a quart jar, this would seem to be a  waste of space and labor. If corn on the cob is to be canned, 2-quart  jars will prove more convenient than 1-quart jars.    71. PEAS.--Peas for canning should be well formed and tender, and they  should be canned as soon as possible after coming from the garden.  Proceed by washing the pods and shelling the peas. Blanch the shelled  peas for 5 to 10 minutes in live steam, and cold-dip them quickly. Pack  the peas into the jars, having them come to within 1/2 inch from the  top, add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful, and fill the jars with  boiling water. Then adjust the jar lids and proceed according to  directions for the method selected. In the water bath, boil for 2 or 3  hours; in the pressure cooker, cook for 1-1/2 hours at a pressure of 5  pounds or for 1 hour at a pressure of 10 pounds.    72. PUMPKIN AND SQUASH.--The canning of pumpkin and squash is advisable  when there is any possibility of their not keeping until they can be  used. Prepare either of these vegetables for canning by first peeling it  and cutting the edible part into inch cubes. Blanch these cubes for 10  to 15 minutes in live steam and cold-dip them quickly. Pack the jars as  full as possible, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jar, but no  water. After adjusting the jar lids, boil the jars of food for 1-1/2  hours in the water bath, or cook them for 1 hour at a pressure of 5  pounds or for 40 minutes at a pressure of 10 pounds in the pressure  cooker. When finished, the jars will be found to be only about half  full, but the contents will keep perfectly.    If desired, pumpkin or squash may first be cooked as if preparing it for  use and then put into the jars for processing.    73. SUCCOTASH.--Of course, succotash is not a vegetable, but the name of  a food that results from combining corn and beans. These vegetables may  be canned together to make for variety in the winter's food supply, or  each may be canned separately and combined later. Clean the ears of corn  in the manner previously directed; then blanch them for 5 minutes and  cold-dip them. Also, remove green Lima beans from the pods, blanch them  for 10 minutes, and cold-dip them. Then cut and scrape the corn off the  cobs and mix it with an equal quantity of the beans. Pack the mixture  into the jars to within 1/2 inch of the top, add a teaspoonful of salt  to each jarful, and fill the jars with boiling water. Adjust the jar  tops and proceed according to the directions for the process to be  employed. In the water bath, boil for 2 hours; in the pressure cooker,  cook for 50 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 35 minutes at a  pressure of 10 pounds.    74. TOMATOES.--As has been stated, tomatoes may be canned successfully  by the open-kettle method. If this method is to be employed, the first  part of the preparation is exactly the same as for the cold-pack method,  except that the jars, jar tops, and jar rubbers must be carefully  sterilized.    For canning, firm tomatoes should be selected if possible, as they will  keep their shape better than those which are very ripe. If some are  soft, they should be sorted out and canned for soup making or made into  catsup. After washing the tomatoes, proceed to blanch them. The length  of time required for blanching depends entirely on the condition of the  tomatoes. They should be blanched for 1 to 3 minutes, or just long  enough to loosen the skin. After blanching, dip them quickly into cold  water and remove the skins. These, it will be found, may be removed  easily and quickly. Pack the tomatoes thus prepared tightly into jars  and fill them with boiling water, boiling tomato juice, or stewed  tomatoes. Add a teaspoonful of salt to each jar. Then adjust the jar  lids and proceed according to the directions given for the method  selected. Boil for 22 minutes in the water bath; in the pressure cooker,  cook for 15 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or for 10 minutes at a  pressure of 10 pounds.    75. TOMATOES FOR SOUP.--If there are soft tomatoes at hand or if  tomatoes are canned by the open-kettle method, quantities of tomato  juice will be available. Such material as this may be put through a  sieve and boiled down for winter use in the making of soups, bisques,  etc. It may be canned simply by pouring the boiling juice into  sterilized jars and sealing them immediately.    76. TOMATOES AND CORN.--An excellent food combination results from  combining stewed tomatoes with corn. Such a combination may be canned  safely by either the open-kettle or the cold-pack method. The acid of  the tomatoes helps to keep the corn, but the combination requires longer  cooking than just plain tomatoes. Prepare each vegetable as for canning  separately, but, if desired, cut the tomatoes into pieces. Mix the two  foods in any desirable proportion and, for the cold-pack canning method,  put the food into the jars. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each jarful,  but no water. Then adjust the jar lids, and proceed to sterilize and  cook the jars of food. In the water bath, cook them 1-1/2 hours; in the  pressure cooker, cook them for 50 minutes at a pressure of 5 pounds or  for 35 minutes at a pressure of 10 pounds.      DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING FRUITS    77. The chief difference between the canning of fruits and the canning  of vegetables is that sugar in the form of sirup, instead of salt water,  is used for the liquid. Fruits may be canned without sugar if desired,  but nothing is gained by so doing, for sugar will have to be added  later. Because of the sugar used in canning and the acid contained in  the fruit, canned fruit has better keeping qualities than canned  vegetables. In fact, it is much more likely to keep well even though it  does not receive such "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#19)"],[1,"Barwan.  From this elevation, I saw that the course of the former ran still in a  good direction for us, to a great distance northward. On that stony  ground I found a new PITTOSPORUM five feet high, with long narrow leaves,  in the way of P. ROEANUM and ANGUSTIFOLIUM, but distinct from both in the  form of its fruit.[*] Latitude of camp 29 deg. 25' 21\". Thermometer at  sunrise, 53 deg.; at noon, 90 deg.; at 4 P. M., 96 deg.; at 9, 69 deg.;--with wet bulb,  61 deg..    [* P. SALICINUM (Lindl. MS.); foliis lineari-lanceolatis coriaccis  acutissimis aveniis, pedunculis unifloris aggregatis axillaribus,  fructibus subglobosis vix compressis.]    19TH MARCH.--Pursuing the Narran, keeping its eastern or left bank, our  course this day was more to the northward. I encamped after travelling  six miles, not only because the ground was soft and heavy for the drays,  but because I saw that the Narran turned much to the eastward, and I  contemplated the passage across it, intending to look for it again, by  travelling northward. Accordingly, as soon as our ground had been marked  out, I crossed to reconnoitre the country in that direction. I found a  fine, open, grassy country, but no signs of the river at the end of five  miles, nor even until I had ridden as far eastward. There, recrossing it,  I returned to the camp through some fine open forest country. Latitude  observed, 29 deg. 21' 51\", S. Thermometer at sunrise, 57 deg.; at 4 P. M., 96 deg.;  at 9, 71 deg.;--with wet bulb, 62 deg..    20TH MARCH.--Retracing my homeward tracks of yesterday, we proceeded in a  nearly E. N. E. direction, along much firmer ground than we had recently  traversed. The great eastern bend of the river was found amongst much  excellent grass and amidst much fine timber. A species of Anthistiria  appeared here, which seemed different from the ordinary sort, although  this was no stranger to me, when exploring the waterless plains westward  of the Lachlan, where it looked as if stunted for want of moisture. Here,  however, this variety presented the same knotty head, where other grasses  grew luxuriantly. After getting round the extreme eastern turn of the  Narran we encamped. Near the spot large rocks appeared in the bed, as if  the river was passing through the stock of the gravelly ridge I had  visited on the 18th. The rock consisted of that found about the basin of  the Darling; a quartzose conglomerate with much felspar, and having  pebbles of quartz imbedded. The large fragments of the conglomerate in  the river bed were angular, and not at all rounded at the edges. Here the  poor natives had been very industrious, as was evident from heaps of the  grass PANICUM LOEVINODE, and of the same redstalked coral-like plant,  also mentioned as having been observed in similar heaps, on the banks of  the Darling, during my journey of 1835 (vol. i. p. 238). I now  ascertained that the seed of the latter is also collected by the natives  and made into a paste. This seed was black and small, resembling fine  gunpowder when shaken out. Nevertheless it was sweet and pleasant to the  taste, possessing a nutty flavour.    The human inhabitants were few, and as invisible as other animals in  these forests--the prints of whose feet were also plain in the soft  smooth surface. As faithless as the snows of the North [*], this soil  bore the impressions of all animals obliged to go to the water, and  amongst them those of the naked feet of men, women, and children, with  the prints likewise of other BIPEDS, such as emus and kangaroos, and also  those of the native dog. Here still was our own race amongst other  animals all new and strange to Europeans. The prints of the foot of man  alone were familiar to us. But here he was living in common with other  animals, simply on the bounty of nature; artless, and apparently as much  afraid of us, and as shy, as other animals of the forest. It seemed  strange, that in a climate the most resembling that of Milton's paradise,  the circumstances of man's existence should be the most degrading.  Latitude of our camp, 29 deg. 19' 26\" S. Thermometer, at sunrise, 55 deg.; at  noon, 100 deg.; at 4 P. M., 101 deg.; at 9, 70 deg.;--with wet bulb, 65 deg.. The mean  elevation above the sea of our camps thus far on the Narran, seven in  number, was 477 feet; the bed of the river being about 15 feet lower.    [* \"And hungry Maukin's ta'en her way To kailyards green, While faithless     snaws ilk step betray Whar she has been.\"   BURNS.]    21ST MARCH.--Proceeded as usual through fine grass, the river coming  favourably round towards the north. At about two miles I found some  traces of horses, and I looked at the river bank for Commissioner  Mitchell's initials, supposing this might be \"Congo,\" where he had forded  the Narran. But we had not reached the latitude of Congo according to his  map. Nevertheless we found here such an excellent dry ford, with gently  sloping banks to a stony bottom, that the two circumstances induced me to  cross the Narran with the party. I travelled west-ward, until meeting  with a dense scrub, I turned towards the friendly Narran, where we  encamped in latitude 29 deg. 15' 31\" S. Thermometer, at sunrise, 56 deg.; at  noon, 97 deg.; at 4 P. M., 101 deg.; at 9, 72 deg.; ditto with wet bulb, 66 deg..    22D MARCH.--Gave the party a day's rest, prayers being read by the  surgeon, as was usual whenever circumstances admitted of our halting on  Sunday. The bed of the Narran presented in several places the denuded  rock, which seems the basis of all the soil and gravel of the country. At  one place irregular concretions of milk-white quartz, cemented by a  ferruginous basis, was predominant; at another, the rough surface of  compact felspar weathering white presented merely the cavities in which  large rounded pebbles had been imbedded, until the partial decomposition  of the felspar, under the river floods, had exposed them once more to the  action of water. The force of those waters, however, had not been  sufficient to cut a channel through very soft rocks extending right  across their course--a circumstance rather characteristic, perhaps, of a  river like the Narran, watering a nearly level country, and terminating  in a swamp. Thermometer at sunrise, 53 deg.; at noon, 95 deg.; at 4 P. M., 98 deg.;  at 9, 72 deg.;--with wet bulb, 66 deg.. Height above the sea, 515 feet, from  eight observations.    23RD MARCH.--All hands were bent on an early start this morning, and,  soon after seven, the party moved off. We crossed much grassy land,  almost approaching to the character of scrub as to bushes; but we pursued  a tolerably straight course to the N.W., until we again made the Narran  at 81/2 miles. Various new plants attracted my attention this day,  especially a beautiful Loranthus on the rosewood Acacia, and a small bush  bearing a green pod resembling a small capsicum in shape. Among the  sedges by the river we found the KYLLINGA MONOCEPHALA; and, on the rich  black clayed soil near it, a species of bindweed out of flower, with  large sagittate leaves: in the scrubs back from the river, grew a small  bush, about four feet high, which has been considered either a variety of  Brown's SANTALUM OBLONGATUM, or a new species distinguished by its narrow  sharp-pointed leaves. The LORANTHUS LINEARI. FOLIUS was growing on the  rosewood Acacia, and the branches of Eucalypti were inhabited by the  parasitical ORANGE LORANTH.[*] Lat., 29 deg.1 0' 6\" S. Therm. at sunrise,  51 deg.; at noon, 95 deg.; at 4 P. M., 99 deg.; at 9, 70 deg.;--wet bulb, 63 deg..    [* L. AURANTIACUS (All. Cunn. MS.); ramis elongatis laxis gracilibus,  foliis oppositis longe petiolatis oblongis obtusis lanceolatisve  acuminatis glabris 3-5-nerviis tenui-marginatis, paniculis folio  brevioribus ditrichotomis, floribus erectis, calycibus subcylindraceis  superne latioribus truncatis, petalis linearibus 6, stylo infra apicem  geniculato, stigmate dilatato truncato.--W. J. H.]    24TH MARCH.--We set off still earlier this morning. I hoped to reach the  Bokhara, on the West, a river shown on the map sent me by the  Commissioner of the district, but after travelling about seven miles to  the northward, I saw rising ground before me, which induced me to turn  towards our own friendly river the Narran; but it proved to be very far  from us, while in my search for it, to my surprise, I found it necessary  to descend several considerable declivities, covered with waterworn  pebbles. At length a slight opening in the dense scrubs through which we  had forced our way, afforded a view towards the south-east of the low  range we were upon, which trended very continuously to the north-west,  covered thickly with the \"Malga\" tree of the natives; to the traveller  the most formidable of scrubs. After several other descents, we reached  the Narran, but only at half-past three in the afternoon, when we had  travelled nearly twenty miles. How the teams were to accomplish this, it  was painful to consider. I sent back a messenger to desire that the  cattle should be detached and brought forward to the water; content to  lose one day, if that indeed would suffice to recover the jaded animals.  Casuarinae now grew amongst the river trees, and reminded me of the banks  of the Karaula in 1831. We had also noticed another novelty in the woods  we passed through this day; a small clump of trees of iron-bark with a  different kind of leaf from that of the tree known by that name in the  colony. On the higher stony land, a bush was common, and proved to be a  broad-leaved variety of EREMOPHILA MITCHELLII, if not a distinct species.  We there met with a new species of the rare and little-known genus,  GEIJERA; forming a strong-scented shrub, about ten feet high, and having  long, narrow, drooping leaves. Its fruit had a weak, peppery taste.[*]  The rare ENCHYLOENA TOMENTOSA formed a shrub a foot high, loaded with  yellow berries: all the specimens were digynous, "]]]
