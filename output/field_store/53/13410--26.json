Saturday, 12th November, William Springs. Very unwell, unable to move  to-day; I am almost blind and suffering greatly from the effects of the  water at Strangway Springs. As I wished to examine round this spring, I  remained here to-day; and, as I could not go myself, sent two of the men  in different directions. At sundown they returned, and reported that  there are no springs for ten miles distant from east-south-east to north.  To the east about three miles there is another lagoon resembling this  one, but not so large, and no springs; plenty of grass about a mile from  the lagoon. Saw two natives at a distance, but could not get near them.    Sunday, 13th November, William Springs. I feel a little better to-day,  but suffer very much from the eyes. I hope I shall be able to travel  to-morrow, for it is misery to remain in camp in the hot weather.  Latitude, 28 degrees 57 minutes 24 seconds. Variation, 4 degrees 47  minutes east.    Monday, 14th November, William Springs. Started on a course of 317  degrees for the Hope Springs, and arrived at 5 p.m. I kept to the west in  order to see what the country was in that direction, in the hope of  finding some more springs. At twenty-one miles crossed the Douglas,  coming from north-north-west; the country from it to the north-west and  north looked quite white with quartz, and showed signs of being  auriferous. From the Douglas to north-west the feed was not quite so  plentiful, salt bush with grass, the salt bush predominating; but as we  approached the Spring of Hope it improved, and became good as we neared  the creek. Distance, thirty miles.    Tuesday, 15th November, Spring of Hope. The spring is still good,  yielding a plentiful supply of water. Sent one of the men to the east and  south-east to examine some white patches of country that I saw on our  journey up here, while I, with one man and two days' provisions, started  south-west to a high and prominent hill in the range. At 11 a.m. arrived  at the top, from which I had a good view of the country all round. It is  a table-topped hill, standing on high table land, which is intersected  with numerous small watercourses, flowing towards the Douglas on the  south and west sides of the mount, which I have named Mount Anna. It is  compound of ironstone, quartz, granite, and a chalky substance, also an  immense quantity of conglomerate quartz and ironstone, which has the  appearance of having been run together in a smelting works. There are  also numerous courses of slate of different descriptions and colours; the  quartz, which exists in white patches, predominates, and gives the  country the appearance of numerous springs. These patches have deceived  me two or three times to-day. At twenty miles the sand hills begin again;  the country being rather poor, with a number of isolated hills, and also  some white chalky cliffs of twenty feet high and upwards. No water nor  appearance of any to the west for a considerable distance. Changed to the  north-west to look at some more white country. I am again disappointed;  it turns out to be quartz with low chalky cliffs, and a large quantity of  igneous stone. Country the same, with salt bush and a little grass in  places. I can see no inducement for me to go further, so I shall return  to the camp. Arrived after dark. My eyes are still very bad, and I suffer  dreadfully from them. To-day has been hot, and the reflection from the  white quartz and the heated stones was almost insufferable: what a relief  it was when the sun went down! Distance, forty-five miles.    Wednesday, 16th November, Spring of Hope. Still very ill, and unable to  go out myself. Sent Muller to examine the creek nearer Mount Margaret for  water; if he finds any near the mount, I shall move there, as it will be  nearer, for building the cone of stones on the top of the mount, than  Hawker Springs. Shod our horses, and built a small cone of stones on a  reef of rocks that runs along the top of a hill about half a mile  west-north-west from the spring, to which it will act as a land mark.  Muller has returned, and reports having found water in the other creek,  about five miles north-north-west from this; the water is in the centre  of the creek, in three or four holes, some of which are brackish, but one  of them is very good. A number of natives were camped about it, but took  to flight the moment they saw him; he tried to induce them to come near  him, but they would not; they appeared to be very much frightened, and  climbed up the cliffs to get out of his way. Plenty of feed between the  two waters; through the hills there is an abundance. I find the water  discovered to-day (which I have named The George Creek, after G.  Davenport, Esquire), will be of no advantage to me when building the cone  of stones; I shall therefore move to the Hawker Springs to-morrow.    Thursday, 17th November, Spring of Hope. Arrived at the Hawker Springs at  noon, and commenced the survey. Springs still good; some of them at this  point will require to be opened. We have opened one, and the water is  beautiful. Immense quantities of reeds and rushes. Built a cone of stones  on the hill at the westernmost spring.    Friday, 18th November, Hawker Springs. Building a cone of stones on the  top of Mount Margaret, and making other preparations for the survey.  To-day very hot, wind south-east; a great deal of lightning to the south.  Obtained bearings of the following points from the hill at Hawker  Springs--namely, Mount Margaret, Mount Younghusband, hill at Parry  Springs, Mount Charles, and Mount Stevenson.    Saturday, 19th November, Hawker Springs. Sent the party on to Fanny  Springs, where I intend to lay down my base-line. Went with Kekwick to  the top of Mount Margaret. This hill is composed of grey and red granite,  quartz, and ironstone; on the lower hill is a blue and brown stratum. I  then proceeded to examine the creeks running to the east; in following  one of them down we came upon another spring of water, running and very  good. The creek is bounded on both sides for about a mile by nearly  perpendicular cliffs, which appeared to get much lower and broken to the  west. It is situated about one mile north of Mount Margaret, and runs  into the Hawker Springs valley. Could see no more higher up. Followed the  creek down to the opening. Proceeded about half a mile, entered another  gorge, and rode up it about three-quarters of a mile; came upon another  spring, running also, water excellent. Numerous native camps in the  creek. Country the same as in the other creek; cliffs slate and not so  high, but more broken, with watercourses between them, through which  cattle could find their way to the tops of the hills, where there appears  to be plenty of grass; there is also an abundance at the mouth of the  gorge and on the plains. This creek also runs into the valley of the  Hawker Springs. Distance from Mount Margaret, two miles and a half, 8  degrees east of north. As it was getting towards sunset I found I must  make for the camp, which was about twelve miles off. Arrived after dark.  Springs still as good as when I first saw them. Very tired, having had a  very long day of it.    Sunday, 20th November, Fanny Springs. Got up at daybreak, and went to the  top of Mount Charles, on which I had ordered the men to build a cone of  stones after their arrival here yesterday. On my return to the camp the  men informed me that Smith had absconded during the night. He generally  made a practice of sleeping some little distance from the others, when I  did not see him lie down; I had checked him for it several times. It did  not appear that he had gone to sleep, but waited an opportunity to steal  away, taking with him the mare which he used to ride, and harness, etc.,  also some provisions. As I had started very early to walk to Mount  Charles, his absence was not observed until some time after I had left,  and being detained some hours on the top of the hill, in consequence of  the atmosphere being so thick that I could not obtain my observations, it  was 7 a.m. before I heard of his departure. That moment I sent Kekwick  for my own horse (he being the swiftest), and ordered him to saddle,  mount, pursue, overtake, and bring Smith back; but during the time he was  preparing, I had time to think the matter over, and decided upon not  following him, as it would only knock up my horse and detain me three or  four days. Smith must have started about midnight, for I was up taking  observations from 12.30 a.m. until daybreak, and neither saw nor heard  any one during that time. I could ill afford to lose the time in pursuing  him, situated as I was in the midst of my survey, and he being a lazy,  insolent, good-for-nothing man, and, worse than all, an incorrigible  liar, I could place no dependence upon him. We are better without him; he  has been a very great annoyance and trouble to me from the beginning  throughout the journey. What could have caused him to take such a step I  am at a loss to imagine; he has had no cause to complain of bad treatment  or anything of that sort; he never mentioned such a thing to the other  men, nor was he heard to complain of anything. Such conduct on an  expedition like ours deserves the severest punishment: there is no  knowing what fatal consequences may follow such a cowardly action. Had he  not stolen the mare, I should have cared little about his running away,  but I am short of riding horses and have a great deal for them to do  during the time I am surveying and examining the country. The vagabond  went off just as the heavy work was beginning, and it was principally for  that work that I engaged him. He put on a pair of new boots, leaving  those he had been wearing, evidently intending to push the mare as far as  she would go, expecting he would be pursued, and then leave her and walk  the rest.

'Oh, but isn't it a shame, to take a poor girl in like that!' cried Mrs.  Goyte. 'Never to let on that he was married, and raise her hopes--I call  it beastly, I do.'    'You don't know,' I said. 'You know how anxious women are to fall in  love, wife or no wife. How could he help it, if she was determined to  fall in love with him?'    'He could have helped it if he'd wanted.'    'Well,' I said, 'we aren't all heroes.'    'Oh, but that's different! The big, good Alfred!--did ever you hear such  tommy-rot in your life! Go on--what does she say at the end?'    'Er--We shall be pleased to hear of your life in England. We all send  many kind regards to your good parents. I wish you all happiness for your  future days. Your very affectionate and ever-grateful Elise.'    There was silence for a moment, during which Mrs. Goyte remained with her  head dropped, sinister and abstracted. Suddenly she lifted her face, and  her eyes flashed.    'Oh, but I call it beastly, I call it mean, to take a girl in like that.'    'Nay,' I said. 'Probably he hasn't taken her in at all. Do you think  those French girls are such poor innocent things? I guess she's a great  deal more downy than he.'    'Oh, he's one of the biggest fools that ever walked,' she cried.    'There you are!' said I.    'But it's his child right enough,' she said.    'I don't think so,' said I.    'I'm sure of it.'    'Oh, well,' I said, 'if you prefer to think that way.'    'What other reason has she for writing like that--'    I went out into the road and looked at the cattle.    'Who is this driving the cows?' I said. She too came out.    'It's the boy from the next farm,' she said.    'Oh, well,' said I, 'those Belgian girls! You never know where their  letters will end. And, after all, it's his affair--you needn't bother.'    'Oh--!' she cried, with rough scorn--'it's not _me_ that bothers. But  it's the nasty meanness of it--me writing him such loving letters'--she  put her hand before her face and laughed malevolently--'and sending him  parcels all the time. You bet he fed that gurrl on my parcels--I know he  did. It's just like him. I'll bet they laughed together over my letters.  I bet anything they did--'    'Nay,' said I. 'He'd burn your letters for fear they'd give him away.'    There was a black look on her yellow face. Suddenly a voice was heard  calling. She poked her head out of the shed, and answered coolly:    'All right!' Then turning to me: 'That's his mother looking after me.'    She laughed into my face, witch-like, and we turned down the road.    When I awoke, the morning after this episode, I found the house darkened  with deep, soft snow, which had blown against the large west windows,  covering them with a screen. I went outside, and saw the valley all white  and ghastly below me, the trees beneath black and thin looking like wire,  the rock-faces dark between the glistening shroud, and the sky above  sombre, heavy, yellowish-dark, much too heavy for this world below of  hollow bluey whiteness figured with black. I felt I was in a valley of  the dead. And I sensed I was a prisoner, for the snow was everywhere  deep, and drifted in places. So all the morning I remained indoors,  looking up the drive at the shrubs so heavily plumed with snow, at the  gateposts raised high with a foot or more of extra whiteness. Or I looked  down into the white-and-black valley that was utterly motionless and  beyond life, a hollow sarcophagus.    Nothing stirred the whole day--no plume fell off the shrubs, the valley  was as abstracted as a grove of death. I looked over at the tiny,  half-buried farms away on the bare uplands beyond the valley hollow, and  I thought of Tible in the snow, of the black witch-like little Mrs.  Goyte. And the snow seemed to lay me bare to influences I wanted to  escape.    In the faint glow of the half-clear light that came about four o'clock in  the afternoon, I was roused to see a motion in the snow away below, near  where the thorn trees stood very black and dwarfed, like a little savage  group, in the dismal white. I watched closely. Yes, there was a flapping  and a struggle--a big bird, it must be, labouring in the snow. I  wondered. Our biggest birds, in the valley, were the large hawks that  often hung flickering opposite my windows, level with me, but high above  some prey on the steep valleyside. This was much too big for a hawk--too  big for any known bird. I searched in my mind for the largest English  wild birds, geese, buzzards.    Still it laboured and strove, then was still, a dark spot, then struggled  again. I went out of the house and down the steep slope, at risk of  breaking my leg between the rocks. I knew the ground so well--and yet I  got well shaken before I drew near the thorn-trees.    Yes, it was a bird. It was Joey. It was the grey-brown peacock with a  blue neck. He was snow-wet and spent.    'Joey--Joey, de-urr!' I said, staggering unevenly towards him. He looked  so pathetic, rowing and struggling in the snow, too spent to rise, his  blue neck stretching out and lying sometimes on the snow, his eye closing  and opening quickly, his crest all battered.    'Joey dee-uur! Dee-urr!' I said caressingly to him. And at last he lay  still, blinking, in the surged and furrowed snow, whilst I came near and  touched him, stroked him, gathered him under my arm. He stretched his  long, wetted neck away from me as I held him, none the less he was quiet  in my arm, too tired, perhaps, to struggle. Still he held his poor,  crested head away from me, and seemed sometimes to droop, to wilt, as if  he might suddenly die.    He was not so heavy as I expected, yet it was a struggle to get up to the  house with him again. We set him down, not too near the fire, and gently  wiped him with cloths. He submitted, only now and then stretched his soft  neck away from us, avoiding us helplessly. Then we set warm food by him.  I _put_ it to his beak, tried to make him eat. But he ignored it. He  seemed to be ignorant of what we were doing, recoiled inside himself  inexplicably. So we put him in a basket with cloths, and left him  crouching oblivious. His food we put near him. The blinds were drawn, the  house was warm, it was night. Sometimes he stirred, but mostly he huddled  still, leaning his queer crested head on one side. He touched no food,  and took no heed of sounds or movements. We talked of brandy or  stimulants. But I realized we had best leave him alone.    In the night, however, we heard him thumping about. I got up anxiously  with a candle. He had eaten some food, and scattered more, making a mess.  And he was perched on the back of a heavy arm-chair. So I concluded he  was recovered, or recovering.    The next day was clear, and the snow had frozen, so I decided to carry  him back to Tible. He consented, after various flappings, to sit in a big  fish-bag with his battered head peeping out with wild uneasiness. And so  I set off with him, slithering down into the valley, making good progress  down in the pale shadow beside the rushing waters, then climbing  painfully up the arrested white valleyside, plumed with clusters of young  pine trees, into the paler white radiance of the snowy, upper regions,  where the wind cut fine. Joey seemed to watch all the time with wide  anxious, unseeing eye, brilliant and inscrutable. As I drew near to Tible  township he stirred violently in the bag, though I do not know if he had  recognized the place. Then, as I came to the sheds, he looked sharply  from side to side, and stretched his neck out long. I was a little afraid  of him. He gave a loud, vehement yell, opening his sinister beak, and I  stood still, looking at him as he struggled in the bag, shaken myself by  his struggles, yet not thinking to release him.    Mrs. Goyte came darting past the end of the house, her head sticking  forward in sharp scrutiny. She saw me, and came forward.    'Have you got Joey?' she cried sharply, as if I were a thief.    I opened the bag, and he flopped out, flapping as if he hated the touch  of the snow now. She gathered him up, and put her lips to his beak. She  was flushed and handsome, her eyes bright, her hair slack, thick, but  more witch-like than ever. She did not speak.    She had been followed by a grey-haired woman with a round, rather sallow  face and a slightly hostile bearing.    'Did you bring him with you, then?' she asked sharply. I answered that I  had rescued him the previous evening.    From the background slowly approached a slender man with a grey moustache  and large patches on his trousers.    'You've got'im back 'gain, ah see,' he said to his daughter-in-law. His  wife explained how I had found Joey.    'Ah,' went on the grey man. 'It wor our Alfred scared him off, back your  life. He must'a flyed ower t'valley. Tha ma' thank thy stars as 'e wor  fun, Maggie. 'E'd a bin froze. They a bit nesh, you know,' he concluded  to me.    'They are,' I answered. 'This isn't their country.'    'No, it isna,' replied Mr. Goyte. He spoke very slowly and deliberately,  quietly, as if the soft pedal were always down in his voice. He looked at  his daughter-in-law as she crouched, flushed and dark, before the  peacock, which would lay its long blue neck for a moment along her lap.  In spite of his grey moustache and thin grey hair, the elderly man had a  face young and almost delicate, like a young man's. His blue eyes  twinkled with some inscrutable source of pleasure, his skin was fine and  tender, his nose delicately arched. His grey hair being slightly ruffled,  he had a debonair look, as of a youth who is in love.    'We mun tell 'im it's come,' he said slowly, and turning he called:  'Alfred--Alfred! Wheer's ter gotten to?'    Then he turned again to the group.    'Get up then, Maggie, lass, get up wi' thee. Tha ma'es too much o'  th'bod.'    A young man approached, wearing rough khaki and kneebreeches. He was"]]]
