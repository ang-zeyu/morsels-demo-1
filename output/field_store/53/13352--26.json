See Lessons 56, 57, 61, 64, and 65.          LESSON 87.    COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.    +Adjectives have one modification;+ viz., _Comparison_.    DEFINITIONS.    +_Comparison_ is a modification of the adjective to express the relative  degree of the quality in the things compared+.    +The _Positive degree_ expresses the simple quality+.    +The _Comparative degree_ expresses a greater or a less degree of the  quality+.    +The _Superlative degree_ expresses the greatest or the least degree of the  quality+.    +RULE.--Adjectives are regularly compared by adding _er_ to the positive to  form the comparative, and _est_ to the positive to form the superlative+.    Adjectives of one syllable are _generally_ compared regularly; adjectives  of two or more syllables are often compared by prefixing _more_ and _most_.    When there are two correct forms, choose the one that can be more easily  pronounced.    Compare the following adjectives. For the spelling, consult your  dictionaries.    Model.--_Positive.  Comparative.   Superlative_.          Lovely,     lovelier,      loveliest; _or_          lovely,     more lovely,   most lovely.      Tame, warm, beautiful, brilliant, amiable, high, mad, greedy, pretty,    hot.    Some adjectives are compared _irregularly_. Learn the following forms.      _Positive.  Comparative.  Superlative_.     Good,      better,       best.     Bad,   |     Evil,  +   worse,        worst.     Ill,   |     Little,    less,         least.     Much,  |     Many,  |   more,         most.          LESSON 88.    COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS.    +_Remember_+ that, when two things or groups of things are compared, the  _comparative_ degree is commonly used; when more than two, the  _superlative_ is employed.    +_Caution_+.--Adjectives should not be _doubly_ compared.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      Of all the boys, George is the more industrious.    Peter was older than the twelve apostles.    Which is the longer of the rivers of America?    This was the most unkindest cut of all.    He chose a more humbler part.    My hat is more handsomer than yours.    The younger of those three boys is the smarter.    Which is the more northerly, Maine, Oregon, or Minnesota?    +_Caution_+.--Do not use adjectives and adverbs extravagantly.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS.      The weather is horrid.    That dress is perfectly awful.    Your coat sits frightfully.    We had an awfully good time.    This is a tremendously hard lesson.    Harry is a mighty nice boy.    +_Remember_+ that adjectives whose meaning does not admit of different  degrees cannot be compared; as, _every_, _universal_.    Use in the three different degrees such of the following adjectives as  admit of comparison.    All, serene, excellent, immortal, first, two, total, infinite,  three-legged, bright.    +_Adverbs_+ are compared in the same manner as adjectives. The following  are compared regularly. Compare them.    Fast, often, soon, late, early.    In the preceding and in the following list, find words that may be used as  adjectives.    The following are compared irregularly. Learn them.      _Pos.          Comp.        Sup. _    -----------   ----------   --------    Badly, Ill,   worse,       worst.    Well,         better,      best.    Little,       less,        least.    Much,         more,        most.    Far,          farther,     farthest.    Adverbs ending in _ly_ are generally compared by prefixing _more_ and  _most_. Compare the following.    Firmly, gracefully, actively, easily.    +To the Teacher+.--Let the pupils select and parse all the adjectives and  adverbs in Lesson 27. For forms, see p. 189. Select other exercises, and  continue the work as long as it is profitable. See \"Schemes\" for review, p.  188.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    How is a noun parsed? What modification have adjectives? What is  comparison? How many degrees of comparison are there? Define each. How are  adjectives regularly compared? Distinguish the uses of the comparative and  the superlative degree. Give the directions for using adjectives and  adverbs (Lesson 88). Illustrate. What adjectives cannot be compared? How  are adverbs compared?          LESSON 89.    MODIFICATION OF VERBS.    VOICE.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--_I picked the rose_. I will tell the same  thing in another way. _The rose was picked by me_. The first verb _picked_  shows that the subject _I_ represents the actor, and the second form of the  verb, _was picked_, shows that the subject names the thing acted upon. This  change in the form of the verb is called +Voice+. The first form is called  the +Active Voice+; and the second, the +Passive Voice+.    The _passive_ form is very convenient when we wish to assert an action  without naming any actor. _Money is coined_ is better than _somebody coins  money_.    DEFINITIONS.    +_Voice_ is that modification of the transitive verb which shows whether  the subject names the _actor_ or the _thing acted upon_+.    +The _Active Voice_ shows that the subject names the actor+.    +The _Passive Voice_ shows that the subject names the thing acted upon+.    In each of the following sentences, change the _voice_ of the verb without  changing the meaning of the sentence. Note the other changes that occur in  the sentence.      The industrious bees gather honey from the flowers.    The storm drove the vessel against the rock.    Our words should be carefully chosen.    Death separates the dearest friends.    His vices have weakened his mind and destroyed his health.    True valor protects the feeble and humbles the oppressor.    The Duke of Wellington, who commanded the English armies in the      Peninsula, never lost a battle.    Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt.    Dr. Livingstone explored a large part of Africa.    The English were conquered by the Normans.    Name all the transitive verbs in Lessons 20 and 22, and give, their  _voice_.          LESSON 90.    MODE, TENSE, NUMBER, AND PERSON.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--When I say, _James walks_, I assert the  walking as a _fact_. When I say, _James may walk_, I do not assert the  action as a fact, but as a _possible_ action. When I say, _If James walk  out, he will improve_, I assert the action, not as an actual fact, but as a  _condition_ of James's, improving. When I say to James, _Walk out_, I do  not assert that James actually does the act, I assert the action as a  _command_.    The action expressed by the verb _walk_ has been asserted in _four_  different _ways_, or +modes+. The first way is called the +Indicative  Mode+; the second, the +Potential Mode+; the third, the +Subjunctive Mode+;  the fourth, the +Imperative Mode+.    Let the teacher give other examples and require the pupils to repeat this  instruction.    For the two forms of the verb called the +Infinitive+ and the +Participle+,  see \"Hints,\" Lessons 48 and 49.    _I walk. I walked. I shall walk_. In each of these three sentences, the  manner of asserting the action is the same. _I walk_ expresses the action  as _present_. _I walked_ expresses the action as _past_, and _I shall walk_  expresses the action as _future_. As +Tense+ means _time_, the first form  is called the +Present Tense+; the second, the +Past Tense+; and the third,  the +Future Tense+.    We have three other forms of the verb, expressing the action as _completed_  in the _present_, the _past_, or the _future_.    _I have walked out to-day. I had walked out when he called. I shall have  walked out by to-morrow_. The form, _have walked_, expressing the action as  _completed_ in the present, is called the +Present Perfect Tense+. The  form, _had walked_, expressing the action as _completed_ in the past, is  called the +Past Perfect Tense+. The form, _shall have walked_, expressing  an action to be _completed_ in the future, is called the +Future Perfect  Tense+.    Let the teacher give other verbs, and require the pupils to name and  explain the different tenses.    _I walk. Thou walkest. He walks. They walk_.    In the second sentence, the verb _walk_ was changed by adding _est_; and in  the third, it was changed by adding _s_. These changes are for the sake of  agreement with the person of the subject. The verb ending in _est_ agrees  with the subject _thou_ in the second person, and the verb ending in _s_  agrees with _he_ in the third person. In the fourth sentence, the subject  is in the third person; but it is plural, and so the verb drops the _s_ to  agree with they in the plural.    Verbs are said to agree in +Person+ and +Number+ with their subjects. The  person and number _forms_ will be found in Lessons 93, 94.    +DEFINITIONS+.    +_Mode_ is that modification of the verb which denotes the manner of  asserting the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7014"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#19)"],[1,"of Chacao. The gold  is contained in pyrites, which are found sometimes disseminated almost  imperceptibly in the whole mass of the gneiss,* and sometimes united  in small veins of quartz. (* The four metals, which are found  disseminated in the granite rocks, as if they were of contemporaneous  formation, are gold, tin, titanium, and cobalt.) Most of the torrents  that traverse the mountains bear along with them grains of gold. The  poor inhabitants of Villa de Cura and San Juan have sometimes gained  thirty piastres a-day by washing the sand; but most commonly, in spite  of their industry, they do not in a week find particles of gold of the  value of two piastres. Here, however, as in every place where native  gold and auriferous pyrites are disseminated in the rock, or by the  destruction of the rocks, are deposited in alluvial lands, the people  conceive the most exaggerated ideas of the metallic riches of the  soil. But the success of the workings, which depends less on the  abundance of the ore in a vast space of land than on its accumulation  in one point, has not justified these favourable prepossessions. The  mountain of Chacao, bordered by the ravine of Tucutunemo, rises seven  hundred feet above the village of San Juan. It is formed of gneiss,  which, especially in the superior strata, passes into mica-slate. We  saw the remains of an ancient mine, known by the name of Real de Santa  Barbara. The works were directed to a stratum of cellular quartz,*  full of polyhedric cavities, mixed with iron-ore, containing  auriferous pyrites and small grains of gold, sometimes, it is said,  visible to the naked eye. (* This stratum of quartz, and the gneiss in  which it is contained, lie hor 8 of the Freyberg compass, and dip 70  degrees to the south-west. At a hundred toises distance from the  auriferous quartz, the gneiss resumes its ordinary situation, hor 3 to  4, with 60 degrees dip to the north-west. A few strata of gneiss  abound in silvery mica, and contain, instead of garnets, an immense  quantity of small octohedrons of pyrites. This silvery gneiss  resembles that of the famous mine of Himmelsfurst, in Saxony.) It  appears that the gneiss of the Cerro de Chacao also furnishes another  metallic deposit, a mixture of copper and silver-ores. This deposit  has been the object of works attempted with great ignorance by some  Mexican miners under the superintendance of M. Avalo. The gallery*  directed to the north-east, is only twenty-five toises long. (* La  Cueva de los Mexicanos.) We there found some fine specimens of blue  carbonated copper mingled with sulphate of barytes and quartz; but we  could not ourselves judge whether the ore contained any argentiferous  fahlerz, and whether it occurred in a stratum, or, as the apothecary  who was our guide asserted, in real veins. This much is certain, that  the attempt at working the mine cost more than twelve thousand  piastres in two years. It would no doubt have been more prudent to  have resumed the works on the auriferous stratum of the Real de Santa  Barbara.    The zone of gneiss just mentioned is, in the coast-chain from the sea  to the Villa de Cura, ten leagues broad. In this great extent of land,  gneiss and mica-slate are found exclusively, and they constitute one  formation.* (* This formation, which we shall call gneiss-mica-slate,  is peculiar to the chain of the coast of Caracas. Five formations must  be distinguished, as MM. von Buch and Raumer have so ably demonstrated  in their excellent papers on Landeck and the Riesengebirge, namely,  granite, granite-gneiss, gneiss, gneiss-mica-slate, and mica-slate.  Geologists whose researches have been confined to a small tract of  land, having confounded these formations which nature has separated in  several countries in the most distinct manner, have admitted that the  gneiss and mica-slate alternate everywhere in superimposed beds, or  furnish insensible transitions from one rock to the other. These  transitions and alternating superpositions take place no doubt in  formations of granite-gneiss and gneiss-mica-slate; but because these  phenomena are observed in one region, it does not follow that in other  regions we may not find very distinct circumscribed formations of  granite, gneiss, and mica-slate. The same considerations may be  applied to the formations of serpentine, which are sometimes isolated,  and sometimes belong to the eurite, mica-slate, and grunstein.) Beyond  the town of Villa de Cura and the Cerro de Chacao the aspect of the  country presents greater geognostic variety. There are still eight  leagues of declivity from the table-land of Cura to the entry of the  Llanos; and on the southern slope of the mountains of the coast, four  different formations of rock cover the gneiss. We shall first give the  description of the different strata, without grouping them  systematically.    On the south of the Cerro de Chacao, between the ravine of Tucutunemo  and Piedras Negras, the gneiss is concealed beneath a formation of  serpentine, of which the composition varies in the different  superimposed strata. Sometimes it is very pure, very homogeneous, of a  dusky olive-green, and of a conchoidal fracture: sometimes it is  veined, mixed with bluish steatite, of an unequal fracture, and  containing spangles of mica. In both these states I could not discover  in it either garnets, hornblende, or diallage. Advancing farther to  the south (and we always passed over this ground in that direction)  the green of the serpentine grows deeper, and feldspar and hornblende  are recognised in it: it is difficult to determine whether it passes  into diabasis or alternates with it. There is, however, no doubt of  its containing veins of copper-ore.* (* One of these veins, on which  two shafts have been sunk, was directed hor. 2.1, and dipped 80  degrees east. The strata of the serpentine, where it is stratified  with some regularity, run hor. 8, and dip almost perpendicularly. I  found malachite disseminated in this serpentine, where it passes into  grunstein.) At the foot of this mountain two fine springs gush out  from the serpentine. Near the village of San Juan, the granular  diabasis appears alone uncovered, and takes a greenish black hue. The  feldspar intimately mixed with the mass, may be separated into  distinct crystals. The mica is very rare, and there is no quartz. The  mass assumes at the surface a yellowish crust like dolerite and  basalt.    In the midst of this tract of trap-formation, the Morros of San Juan  rise like two castles in ruins. They appear linked to the mornes of  St. Sebastian, and to La Galera which bounds the Llanos like a rocky  wall. The Morros of San Juan are formed of limestone of a crystalline  texture; sometimes very compact, sometimes spongy, of a greenish-grey,  shining, composed of small grains, and mixed with scattered spangles  of mica. This limestone yields a strong effervescence with acids. I  could not find in it any vestige of organized bodies. It contains in  subordinate strata, masses of hardened clay of a blackish blue, and  carburetted. These masses are fissile, very heavy, and loaded with  iron; their streak is whitish, and they produce no effervescence with  acids. They assume at their surface, by their decomposition in the  air, a yellow colour. We seem to recognize in these argillaceous  strata a tendency either to the transition-slates, or to the  kieselschiefer (schistose jasper), which everywhere characterise the  black transition-limestones. When in fragments, they might be taken at  first sight for basalt or hornblende.* (* I had an opportunity of  examining again, with the greatest care, the rocks of San Juan, of  Chacao, of Parapara, and of Calabozo, during my stay at Mexico, where,  conjointly with M. del Rio, one of the most distinguished pupils of  the school of Freyberg, I formed a geognostical collection for the  Colegio de Mineria of New Spain.) Another white limestone, compact,  and containing some fragments of shells, backs the Morros de San Juan.  I could not see the line of junction of these two limestones, or that  of the calcareous formation and the diabasis.    The transverse valley which descends from Piedras Negras and the  village of San Juan, towards Parapara and the Llanos, is filled with  trap-rocks, displaying close affinity with the formation of green  slates, which they cover. Sometimes we seem to see serpentine,  sometimes grunstein, and sometimes dolerite and basalt. The  arrangement of these problematical masses is not less extraordinary.  Between San Juan, Malpaso, and Piedras Azules, they form strata  parallel to each other; and dipping regularly northward at an angle of  40 or 50 degrees, they cover even the green slates in concordant  stratification. Lower down, towards Parapara and Ortiz, where the  amygdaloids and phonolites are connected with the grunstein,  everything assumes a basaltic aspect. Balls of grunstein heaped one  upon another, form those rounded cones, which are found so frequently  in the Mittelgebirge in Bohemia, near Bilin, the country of  phonolites. The following is the result of my partial observations.    The grunstein, which at first alternated with strata of serpentine, or  was connected with that rock by insensible transitions, is seen alone,  sometimes in strata considerably inclined, and sometimes in balls with  concentric strata, imbedded in strata of the same substance. It lies,  near Malpaso, on green slates, steatitic, mingled with hornblende,  destitute of mica and grains of quartz, dipping, like the grunsteins,  45 degrees toward the north, and directed, like them, 75 degrees  north-west.    A great sterility prevails where these green slates predominate, no  doubt on account of the magnesia they contain, which (as is proved by  the magnesian-limestone of England*) is very hurtful to vegetation.
