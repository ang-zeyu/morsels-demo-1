Each succeeding Pope, however much he may have differed from  his predecessors on other points, zealously agreed in one, that of  maintaining by every possible means the papal ascendancy. No scheme was  so likely to aid in this endeavour as the Crusades. As long as they  could persuade the kings and nobles of Europe to fight and die in  Syria, their own sway was secured over the minds of men at home. Such  being their object, they never inquired whether a Crusade was or was  not likely to be successful, whether the time were well or ill chosen,  or whether men and money could be procured in sufficient abundance.  Pope Innocent III. would have been proud if he could have bent the  refractory Monarchs of England and France into so much submission. But  John and Philip Augustus were both engaged. Both had deeply offended  the church, and had been laid under her ban, and both were occupied in  important reforms at home; Philip in bestowing immunities upon his  subjects, and John in having them forced from him. The emissaries of  the Pope therefore plied them in vain;--but as in the first and second  Crusades, the eloquence of a powerful preacher incited the nobility,  and through them a certain portion of the people, Foulque, Bishop of  Neuilly, an ambitious and enterprizing prelate, entered fully into the  views of the Court of Rome, and preached the Crusade wherever he could  find an audience.  Chance favoured him to a degree he did not himself  expect, for he had in general found but few proselytes, and those few  but cold in the cause. Theobald, Count of Champagne, had instituted a  grand tournament, to which he had invited all the nobles from far and  near.  Upwards of two thousand knights were present with their  retainers, besides a vast concourse of people to witness the sports. In  the midst of the festivities Foulque arrived upon the spot, and  conceiving the opportunity to be a favourable one, he addressed the  multitude in eloquent language, and passionately called upon them to  enrol themselves for the new Crusade. The Count de Champagne, young,  ardent, and easily excited, received the cross at his hands. The  enthusiasm spread rapidly. Charles Count of Blois followed the example,  and of the two thousand knights present, scarcely one hundred and fifty  refused. The popular phrensy seemed on the point of breaking out as in  the days of yore. The Count of Flanders, the Count of Bar, the Duke of  Burgundy, and the Marquis of Montferrat, brought all their vassals to  swell the train, and in a very short space of time an effective army  was on foot and ready to march to Palestine.    The dangers of an overland journey were too well understood, and the  crusaders endeavoured to make a contract with some of the Italian  states to convey them over in their vessels. Dandolo, the aged Doge of  Venice, offered them the galleys of the Republic; but the crusaders, on  their arrival in that city, found themselves too poor to pay even half  the sum demanded. Every means was tried to raise money; the crusaders  melted down their plate, and ladies gave up their trinkets.  Contributions were solicited from the faithful, but came in so slowly,  as to make it evident to all concerned, that the faithful of Europe  were outnumbered by the prudent. As a last resource, Dandolo offered to  convey them to Palestine at the expense of the Republic, if they would  previously aid in the recapture of the city of Zara, which had been  seized from the Venetians a short time previously by the King of  Hungary. The crusaders consented, much to the displeasure of the Pope,  who threatened excommunication upon all who should be turned aside from  the voyage to Jerusalem. But notwithstanding the fulminations of the  church, the expedition never reached Palestine. The siege of Zara was  speedily undertaken. After a long and brave defence, the city  surrendered at discretion, and the crusaders were free, if they had so  chosen it, to use their swords against the Saracens. But the ambition  of the chiefs had been directed, by unforeseen circumstances, elsewhere.    After the death of Manuel Comnenus, the Greek empire had fallen a prey  to intestine divisions. His son Alexius II. had succeeded him, but was  murdered after a very short reign by his uncle Andronicus, who seized  upon the throne. His reign also was but of short duration.  Isaac  Angelus, a member of the same family, took up arms against the usurper,  and having defeated and captured him in a pitched battle, had him put  to death. He also mounted the throne only to be cast down from it. His  brother Alexius deposed him, and to incapacitate him from reigning, put  out his eyes, and shut him up in a dungeon. Neither was Alexius III.  allowed to remain in peaceable possession of the throne; the son of the  unhappy Isaac, whose name also was Alexius, fled from Constantinople,  and hearing that the crusaders had undertaken the siege of Zara, made  them the most magnificent offers if they would afterwards aid him in  deposing his uncle. His offers were, that if by their means he was  re-established in his father's dominions, he would place the Greek  church under the authority of the Pope of Rome, lend the whole force of  the Greek Empire to the conquest of Palestine, and distribute two  hundred thousand marks of silver among the crusading army. The offer  was accepted, with a proviso on the part of some of the leaders, that  they should be free to abandon the design, if it met with the  disapproval of the Pope. But this was not to be feared. The submission  of the schismatic Greeks to the See of Rome was a greater bribe to the  Pontiff, than the utter annihilation of the Saracen power in Palestine  would have been.    The crusaders were soon in movement for the imperial city. Their  operations were skilfully and courageously directed, and spread such  dismay as to paralyse the efforts of the usurper to retain possession  of his throne. After a vain resistance, he abandoned the city to its  fate, and fled no one knew whither. The aged and blind Isaac was taken  from his dungeon by his subjects, and placed upon the throne ere the  crusaders were apprized of the flight of his rival. His son Alexius IV.  was afterwards associated with him in the sovereignty.    But the conditions of the treaty gave offence to the Grecian people,  whose prelates refused to place themselves under the dominion of the  See of Rome. Alexius at first endeavoured to persuade his subjects to  submission, and prayed the crusaders to remain in Constantinople until  they had fortified him in the possession of a throne which was yet far  from secure. He soon became unpopular with his subjects; and breaking  faith with regard to the subsidies, he offended the crusaders. War was  at length declared upon him by both parties; by his people for his  tyranny, and by his former friends for his treachery. He was seized in  his palace by his own guards and thrown into prison, while the  crusaders were making ready to besiege his capital. The Greeks  immediately proceeded to the election of a new Monarch; and looking  about for a man with courage, energy, and perseverance, they fixed upon  Alexius Ducas, who, with almost every bad quality, was possessed of the  virtues they needed. He ascended the throne under the name of  Murzuphlis. One of his first acts was to rid himself of his youngest  predecessor--a broken heart had already removed the blind old Isaac--no  longer a stumbling block in his way--and the young Alexius was soon  after put to death in his prison.    War to the knife was now declared between the Greeks and the Franks,  and early in the spring of the year 1204, preparations were commenced  for an assault upon Constantinople. The French and Venetians entered  into a treaty for the division of the spoils among their soldiery, for  so confident were they of success, that failure never once entered into  their calculations. This confidence led them on to victory, while the  Greeks, cowardly as treacherous people always are, were paralysed by a  foreboding of evil. It has been a matter of astonishment to all  historians, that Murzuphlis, with the reputation for courage which he  had acquired, and the immense resources at his disposal, took no better  measures to repel the onset of the crusaders.  Their numbers were as a  mere handful in comparison with those which he could have brought  against them; and if they had the hopes of plunder to lead them on, the  Greeks had their homes to fight for, and their very existence as a  nation to protect. After an impetuous assault, repulsed for one day,  but renewed with double impetuosity on another, the crusaders lashed  their vessels against the walls, slew every man who opposed them, and,  with little loss to themselves, entered the city. Murzuphlis fled, and  Constantinople was given over to be pillaged by the victors. The wealth  they found was enormous. In money alone there was sufficient to  distribute twenty marks of silver to each knight, ten to each squire or  servant at arms, and five to each archer. Jewels, velvets, silks, and  every luxury of attire, with rare wines and fruits, and valuable  merchandise of every description, also fell into their hands, and were  bought by the trading Venetians, and the proceeds distributed among the  army. Two thousand persons were put to the sword; but had there been  less plunder to take up the attention of the victors, the slaughter  would in all probability have been much greater.    In many of the bloody wars which defile the page of history, we find  that soldiers, utterly reckless of the works of God, will destroy his  masterpiece, man, with unsparing brutality, but linger with respect  around the beautiful works of art. They will slaughter women and  children, but spare a picture; will hew"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/714"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins in the Country (#19)"],[1,"and string-beans that were ripe, besides three dozen ears of the  choicest corn, called \"Country Gentleman.\"    \"Children can only eat very tender corn,\" said Uncle Daniel, \"and as  that is sweet and milky they will have no trouble digesting it.\"    Harry looked over every ear of the green corn by pulling the husks down  and any that seemed a bit overripe he discarded.    \"We will have to take the long wagon,\" said Bert, as they began to  count up the baskets. There were two of beans, three of corn, one of  lettuce, two of sweet apples, besides five bunches of Freddie's  radishes.    \"Be sure to bring Sandy back with you,\" called Freddie, who did not go  to the camp this time. \"Tell him I'll let him be my twin brother.\"    Nan and Aunt Sarah went with the boys, but how disappointed they were  to find a strange matron in charge of the camp, and Sandy's eyes red  from crying after Mrs. Manily.    \"Oh, I knowed you would come to take me to Freddie,\" cried he, \"'cause  my other mamma is gone too, and I'm all alone.\"    \"Mrs. Manily was called away by sickness in her family,\" explained the  new matron, \"and I cannot do anything with this little boy.\"    \"He was so fond of Mrs. Manily,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"and besides he  remembers how lonely he was when his own mother went away. Maybe we  could bring him over to our house for a few days.\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Manily spoke of that,\" said the matron, \"and she had  received permission from the Society to let Edward pay a visit to Mrs.  Daniel Bobbsey. See, here is the card.\"    \"Oh, that will be lovely!\" cried Nan, hugging Sandy as tight as her  arms could squeeze.    \"Freddie told us to be sure to bring you back with us.\"    \"I am so glad to get these things,\" the matron said to Aunt Sarah, as  she took the aprons, \"for everybody has been upset with Mrs. Manily  having to leave so suddenly. The aprons are lovely. Did the little  girls make them?\"    Aunt Sarah told her about the sewing school, and then she said she was  going to have a little account printed about it in the year's report of  good work done for the Aid Society.    \"And Mrs. Manily has written an account of your circus,\" the matron  told Harry and Bert, for she had heard about the boys and their  successful charity work.    Some of the girls who knew Nan came up now and told her how Nellie, the  little cash-girl, had been taken sick and had had to be removed to the  hospital tent over in the other mountain.    This was sad news to Nan, for she loved the little cash-girl, and hoped  to see her and perhaps have her pay a visit to Aunt Sarah's.    \"Is she very sick?\" Aunt Sarah asked the matron.    \"Yes indeed,\" the other replied. \"But the doctor will soon cure her, I  think.\"    \"The child is too young to work so hard,\" Aunt Sarah declared. \"It is  no wonder her health breaks down at the slightest cause, when she has  no strength laid away to fight sickness.\"    By this time a big girl had washed and dressed Sandy, and now what a  pretty boy he was! He wore a blue-and-white-striped linen suit and had  a jaunty little white cap just like Freddie's.    He was so anxious to go that he jumped in the wagon before the others  were ready to start.    \"Get app, Bill!\" he called, grabbing at the reins, and off the old  horse started with no one in the wagon but Sandy!    Sandy had given the reins such a jerk that Bill started to run, and the  more the little boy tried to stop him the harder he went!    \"Don't slap him with the reins!\" called Harry, who was now running down  the hill as hard as he could after the wagon. \"Pull on the reins!\" he  called again.    But Sandy was so excited he kept slapping the straps up and down on  poor Bill, which to the horse, of course, meant to go faster.    \"He'll drive in the brook,\" called Bert in alarm also rushing after the  runaway.  \"Whoa, Bill! whoa, Bill!\" called everybody, the children from  the camp having now joined in following the wagon.    The brook was directly in front of Sandy.    \"Quick, Harry!\" yelled Bert. \"You'll get him in a minute.\"    It was no easy matter, however, to overtake Sandy, for the horse had  been on a run from the start. But Sandy kept his seat well, and even  seemed to think it good fun now to have everybody running after him and  no one able to catch him.    \"Oh, I'm so afraid he'll go in the pond!\" Nan told Aunt Sarah almost in  tears.    \"Bill would sit down first,\" declared Aunt Sarah, who knew her horse to  be an intelligent animal.    \"Oh! oh! oh!\" screamed everybody, for the horse had crossed from the  road into the little field that lay next the water.    \"Whoa, Bill!\" shouted Aunt Sarah at the top of her voice, and instantly  the horse stood still.    The next minute both Bert and Harry were in the wagon beside Sandy.    \"Can't I drive?\" asked the little fellow innocently, while Harry was  backing out of the swamp.    \"You certainly made Bill go,\" Harry admitted, all out of breath from  running.    \"And you gave us a good run too,\" added Bert, who was red in the face  from his violent exercise.    \"Bill knew ma meant it when she said whoa!\" Harry remarked to Bert. \"I  tell you, he stopped just in time, for a few feet further would have  sunk horse, wagon, and all in the swamp.\"    Of course it was all an accident, for Sandy had no idea of starting the  horse off, so no one blamed him when they got back to the road.    \"We'll all get in this time,\" laughed Aunt Sarah to the matron. \"And  I'll send the boys over Sunday to let you know how Sandy is.\"    \"Oh, he will be all right with Freddie!\" Bert said, patting the little  stranger on the shoulders. \"We will take good care of him.\"    It was a pleasant ride back to the Bobbsey farm, and all enjoyed  it--especially Sandy, who had gotten the idea he was a first-class  driver and knew all about horses, old Bill, in particular.    \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted Freddie, when the wagon turned in the drive.  \"I knowed you would come, Sandy!\" and the next minute the two little  boys were hand in hand running up to the barn to see Frisky, Snoop, the  chickens, ducks, pigeons, and everything at once.    Sandy was a little city boy and knew nothing about real live country  life, so that everything seemed quite wonderful to him, especially the  chickens and ducks. He was rather afraid of anything as big as Frisky.    Snoop and Fluffy were put through their circus tricks for the  stranger's benefit, and then Freddie let Sandy turn on his trapeze up  under the apple tree and showed him all the different kinds of turns  Bert and Harry had taught the younger twin how to perform on the swing.    \"How long can you stay?\" Freddie asked his little friend, while they  were swinging.    \"I don't know,\" Sandy replied vaguely.    \"Maybe you could go to the seashore with us,\" Freddie ventured. \"We are  only going to stay in the country this month.\"    \"Maybe I could go,\" lisped Sandy, \"'cause nobody ain't got charge of me  now. Mrs. Manily has gone away, you know, and I don't b'lieve in the  other lady, do you?\"    Freddie did not quite understand this but he said \"no\" just to agree  with Sandy.    \"And you know the big girl, Nellie, who always curled my hair without  pulling it,--she's gone away too, so maybe I'm your brother now,\" went  on the little orphan.    \"Course you are!\" spoke up Freddie manfully, throwing his arms around  the other, \"You're my twin brother too, 'cause that's the realest kind.  We are all twins, you know--Nan and Bert, and Flossie and me and you!\"    By this time the other Bobbseys had come out to welcome Sandy. They  thought it best to let Freddie entertain him at first, so that he would  not be strange, but now Uncle Daniel just took the little fellow up in  his arms and into his heart, for all good men love boys, especially  when they are such real little men as Sandy and Freddie happened to be.    \"He's my twin brother, Uncle Daniel,\" Freddie insisted. \"Don't you  think he's just like me curls and all?\"    \"He is certainly a fine little chap!\" the uncle replied, meaning every  word of it, \"and he is quite some like you too. Now let us feed the  chickens. See how they are around us expecting something to eat?\"    The fowls were almost ready to eat the pearl buttons off Sandy's coat,  so eager were they for their meal, and it was great fun for the two  little boys to toss the corn to them.    \"Granny will eat from your hand,\" exclaimed Uncle Daniel, \"You see, she  is just like granite-gray stone, but we call her Granny for short.\"    The Plymouth Rock hen came up to Sandy, and much to his delight ate the  corn out of his little white hand.    \"Oh, she's a pretty chicken!\" he said, stroking Granny as he would a  kitten. \"I dust love chitens,\" he added, sitting right down on the  sandy ground to let Granny come up on his lap. There was so much to see  in the poultry yard that Sandy, Freddie, and Uncle Daniel lingered  there until Martha appeared at the back door and rang the big dinner  bell in a way that meant, \"Hurry up! something will get cold if you  don't.\"    And the something proved to be chicken pot-pie with dumplings that  everybody loves. And after that there came apple pudding with hard  sauce, just full of sugar.    \"Is it a party?\" Sandy whispered to Freddie, for he was not accustomed  to more than bread and milk at his evening meal.    \"Yes, I guess so,\" ventured Freddie; \"it's because you came,\" and then  Dinah brought in little play cups of chocolate with jumbles on the  side, and Mrs. Bobbsey said that would be better than the pudding for  Freddie and Sandy.    \"I guess I'll just live here,\" solemnly said the little stranger, as if  his decision in such a matter should not be questioned.    \"I guess you better!\" Freddie agreed, \"'cause it's nicer than over  there, isn't it?\"    \"Lots,\" replied Sandy, \"only maybe Mrs. Manily will cry for me,\" and he  looked sad as his big blue eyes turned around and blinked to keep back  some tears. \"I dust love Mrs. Manily, Freddie; don't"]]]
