[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#19)"],[1," by the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant  Aid Society announced that it was able to care for at least fifty  persons as long as might be necessary. The German Society of New York,  the Irish Immigrant Society, the Italian Society, the Swedish Immigrant  Society and the Young Men's Christian Association were among the  organizations that also offered to see that no needy survivor would go  without shelter.    Mrs. W. A. Bastede, whose husband is a member of the staff of St. Luke's  Hospital, offered to the White Star Line the use of the newly opened  ward at St. Luke's, which will accommodate from thirty to sixty persons.  She said the hospital would send four ambulances with nurses and doctors  and that she had collected clothing enough for fifty persons. The line  accepted her offer and said that the hospital would be kept informed as  to what was needed. A trustee of Bellevue also called at the White Star  offices to offer ambulances. He said that five or six, with two or three  doctors and nurses on each, would be sent to the pier if required.    Many other hospitals as well as individuals called at the mayor's  office, expressing willingness to take in anybody that should be sent to  them. A woman living in Fiftieth Street just off Fifth Avenue wished  to put her home at the disposal of the survivors. D. H. Knott, of 102  Waverley Place, told the mayor that he could take care of 100 and give  them both food and lodging at the Arlington, Holly and Earl Hotels.  Commissioner Drummond visited the City Hall and arranged with the  mayor the plans for the relief to be extended directly by the city. Mr.  Drummond said that omnibuses would be provided to transfer passengers  from the ship to the Municipal Lodging House.      MRS. VANDERBILT'S EFFORTS    Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt, Jr., spent the day telephoning to her friends,  asking them to let their automobiles be used to meet the Carpathia and  take away those who needed surgical care. It was announced that as a  result of Mrs. Vanderbilt's efforts 100 limousine automobiles and all  the Fifth Avenue and Riverside Drive automobile buses would be at the  Cunard pier.    Immigration Commissioner Williams said that he would be at the pier when  the Carpathia came in. There was to be no inspection of immigrants at  Ellis Island. Instead, the commissioner sent seven or eight inspectors  to the pier to do their work there and he asked them to do it with the  greatest possible speed and the least possible bother to the shipwrecked  aliens. The immigrants who had no friends to meet them were to be  provided for until their cases could be disposed of. Mr. Williams  thought that some of them who had lost everything might have to be sent  back to their homes. Those who were to be admitted to the United States  were to be cared for by the Women's Relief Committee.      RED CROSS RELIEF    Robert W. de Forest, chairman of the Red Cross Relief Committee of the  Charity Organization Society, after conferring with Mayor Gaynor, said  that in addition to an arrangement that all funds received by the  mayor should be paid to Jacob H. Schiff, the New York treasurer of the  American Red Cross, the committee had decided that it could turn over  all the immediate relief work to the Women's Relief Committee.    The Red Cross Committee announced that careful plans had been made to  provide for every possible emergency.    The emergency committee received a telegram that Ernest P. Bicknell,  director of the American Red Cross, was coming from Washington. The Red  Cross Emergency Relief Committee was to have several representatives at  the pier to look out for the passengers on the Carpathia. Mr. Persons  and Dr. Devine were to be there and it was planned to have others.    The Salvation Army offered, through the mayor's office, accommodation  for thirty single men at the Industrial Home, 533 West Forty-eighth  Street, and for twenty others at its hotel, 18 Chatham Square. The  army's training school at 124 West Fourteenth Street was ready to take  twenty or thirty survivors. R. H. Farley, head of the White Star Line's  third class department, said that the line would give all the steerage  passengers railroad tickets to their destination.    Mayor Gaynor estimated that more than 5000 persons could be accommodated  in quarters offered through his orders. Most of these offers of course  would have to be rejected. The mayor also said that Colonel Conley of  the Sixty-ninth Regiment offered to turn out his regiment to police the  pier, but it was thought that such service would be unnecessary.      CROWDS AT THE DOCKS    Long before dark on Thursday night a few people passed the police lines  and with a yellow card were allowed to go on the dock; but reports had  been published that the Carpathia would not be in till midnight, and by  8 o'clock there were not more than two hundred people on the pier. In  the next hour the crowd with passes trebled in number. By 9 o'clock the  pier held half as many as it could comfortably contain. The early crowd  did not contain many women relatives of the survivors. Few nervous  people could be seen, but here and there was a woman, usually supported  by two male escorts, weeping softly to herself.    On the whole it was a frantic, grief-crazed crowd. Laborers rubbed  shoulders with millionaires.    The relatives of the rich had taxicabs waiting outside the docks. The  relatives of the poor went there on foot in the rain, ready to take  their loved ones.    A special train was awaiting Mrs. Charles M. Hays, widow of the  president of the Grand Trunk Railroad. A private car also waited Mrs.  George D. Widener.      EARLY ARRIVALS AT PIER    Among the first to arrive at the pier was a committee from the Stock  Exchange, headed by R. H. Thomas, and composed of Charles Knoblauch, B.  M. W. Baruch, Charles Holzderber and J. Carlisle. Mr. Thomas carried  a long black box which contained $5000 in small bills, which was to  be handed out to the needy steerage survivors of the Titanic as they  disembarked.    With the early arrivals at the pier were the relatives of Frederick  White, who was not reported among the survivors, though Mrs. White  was; Harry Mock, who came to look for a brother and sister; and Vincent  Astor, who arrived in a limousine with William A. Dobbyn, Colonel  Astor's secretary, and two doctors. The limousine was kept waiting  outside to take Mrs. Astor to the Astor home on Fifth Avenue.    EIGHT LIMOUSINE CARS    The Waldorf-Astoria had sent over eight limousine car to convey to the  hotel these survivors:    Mrs. Mark Fortune and three daughters, Mrs. Lucien P. Smith, Mrs. J.  Stewart White, Mrs. Thornton Davidson, Mrs. George C. Douglass, Mrs.  George D. Widener and maid, Mrs. George Wick, Miss Bonnell, Miss E.  Ryerson, Mrs. Susan P. Ryerson, Mrs. Arthur Ryerson, Miss Mary Wick, the  Misses Howell, Mrs. John P. Snyder and Mr. and Mrs. D. H. Bishop.      THIRTY-FIVE AMBULANCES AT THE PIER    At one time there were thirty-five ambulances drawn up; outside the  Cunard pier. Every hospital in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx was  represented. Several of the ambulances came from as far north as the  Lebanon Hospital, in the Bronx, and the Brooklyn Hospital, in Brooklyn.    Accompanying them were seventy internes and surgeons from the staffs of  the hospitals, and more than 125 male and female nurses.    St. Vincent's sent the greatest number of ambulances, at one time, eight  of them from this hospital being in line at the pier.    Miss Eva Booth, direct head of the Salvation Army, was at the pier,  accompanied by Miss Elizabeth Nye and a corps of her officers, ready  to aid as much as possible. The Sheltering Society and various other  similar organizations also were represented, all ready to take care of  those who needed them.    An officer of the Sixty-ninth Regiment, N. G. N. Y., offered the White  Star Line officials, the use of the regiment's armory for any of the  survivors.    Mrs. Thomas Hughes, Mrs. August Belmont and Mgrs. Lavelle and McMahon,  of St. Patrick's Cathedral, together with a score of black-robed Sisters  of Charity, representing the Association of Catholic Churches, were  on the pier long before the Carpathia was made fast, and worked  industriously in aiding the injured and ill.    The Rev. Dr. William Carter, pastor of the Madison Avenue Reformed  Church, was one of those at the pier with a private ambulance awaiting  Miss Sylvia Caldwell, one of the survivors, who is known in church  circles as a mission worker in foreign fields      FREE RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION    The Pennsylvania Railroad sent representatives to the pier, who said  that the railroad had a special train of nine cars in which it would  carry free any passenger who wanted to go immediately to Philadelphia  or points west. The Pennsylvania also had eight taxicabs at the pier for  conveyance of the rescued to the Pennsylvania Station, in Thirty-third  Street.    Among those who later arrived at the pier before the Carpathia docked  were P. A. B. Widener, of Philadelphia, two women relatives of J. B.  Thayer, William Harris, Jr., the theatrical man, who was accompanied by  Dr Dinkelspiel, and Henry Arthur Jones, the playwright.    RELATIVES OF SAVED AND LOST    Commander Booth, of the Salvation Army, was there especially to meet  Mrs. Elizabeth Nye and Mrs. Rogers Abbott, both Titanic survivors. Mrs.  Abbott's two sons were supposed to be among the lost. Miss Booth had  received a cablegram from London saying that other Salvation Army people  were on the Titanic. She was eager to get news of them.    Also on the pier was Major Blanton, U. S. A., stationed at Washington,  who was waiting for tidings of Major Butt, supposedly at the instance of  President Taft.    Senator William A. Clark and Mrs. Clark were also in the company. Dr.  John R. MacKenty was waiting for Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Harper. Ferdinand  W. Roebling and Carl G. Roebling, cousins of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#19)"],[1,"considered  his preparatory school too strenuous for him, and, as he had considerably  outgrown his strength, it was arranged to allow him to miss the spring  term and to stay at Durracombe until Easter. He was to go every morning  to the Vicarage for private lessons from Mr. Carey, and he was to be out  of doors as much as possible, drink plenty of milk, and try, as his  grandfather expressed it, to 'put on flesh.' Master Clive himself was  only too well content to have what he justly considered a continuation of  his holidays. He did not mean to be too clever over his lessons at the  Vicarage, and, indeed, he planned to make a little work go a long way.  Being out of doors as much as possible suited him exactly. He strutted  about Durracombe, with a rolling naval walk, making friends with  everybody, and telling them he had quite determined to go to sea and  become an Admiral. He went out motoring with his grandfather or Dr.  Ramsay, and he spent a considerable portion of time with Tom, the old  gardener, who was long-suffering in many ways, though roused to wrath by  any injury to his young bedding-out plants. Mrs. Ramsay 'mothered' Clive,  feeling it was some return for the kindness which Uncle David had shown  to her own girls. She grew fond of the young scapegrace and covered his  escapades as far as possible, so as not to alarm nervous Aunt Nellie, who  would have been much perturbed at some of her grandson's reckless  performances.    There was no harm about Clive; he was simply a young, restless, fast-  growing boy, who constantly wanted fresh outlets for his energies. He  loved to tease his cousins, but met his match in Merle, who generally  turned the tables and carried the war into the enemy's camp. When they  were not sparring or playing jokes upon one another, the two were firm  allies. Merle had always wished for a brother, and lively Clive was a  companion after her own heart. Mrs. Ramsay, indeed, complained that her  younger daughter was becoming an utter tomboy, but she was glad for the  two to be together, as she could trust Merle not to allow her cousin to  go too far, and to keep him from endangering either his own limbs or the  safety and comfort of other people.    The Spring term had advanced only a few weeks when a most untoward thing  happened. Merle got mumps! How she picked them up nobody knew, but, as  mother said, in a doctor's house you may always be prepared to catch  anything, and it was a marvel the children had had so few complaints.  Merle was not really very ill, but her face and neck were swollen and  painful, and, worst of all, she was considered in a highly infectious  condition and was carefully isolated in a top bedroom. Neither Mavis nor  Clive had had mumps, and it was hoped they might escape, though as they  had been with Merle the germs might still be incubating. Mavis was, of  course, not allowed to go to 'The Moorings,' and Clive was debarred from  his lessons at The Vicarage, and they had to preserve a species of  quarantine, equally trying to them both, for at Dr. Tremayne's suggestion  Mavis turned temporary governess to Clive and coached him in several  subjects in which he was deficient. The young rascal, highly aggrieved at  this unexpected tuition, took liberties with his gentle cousin which he  would not have dared to take with Mr. Carey, and extracted as much fun as  possible from his studies. Mavis was quite sure he made mistakes on  purpose, and pretended to be stupid in order to reduce the standard of  what was required, but the main object was to keep him quiet and out of  mischief, and her teaching served that end at any rate.    \"I wouldn't be a mistress in a boys' preparatory school if they offered  me a thousand a year!\" she told Mother. \"I'd rather clean doorsteps, or  sew buttons on shirts at a farthing a dozen, or sell watercress, or wash  dishes in a restaurant!\"    \"Nonsense! It's not so bad as all that, surely!\" laughed Mrs. Ramsay.  \"If you knew how the little wretch rags me! I only wish it was Merle who  had to teach him and that I had the mumps instead. It must be nice and  quite comfortable by the fire upstairs!\"    Merle, however, did not at all appreciate the privilege of being ill and  confined to one room. She was not so fond of indoor amusements as her  sister, and soon tired of reading and drawing and games of patience. Her  great grievance was that she was left so much alone. Mrs. Ramsay had to  attend to Aunt Nellie, to answer the telephone, and to interview patients  who came while the doctors were out and to take their messages, as well  as to do the housekeeping, so she was kept constantly busy and had not  much time to sit upstairs with Merle. Dr. Tremayne and her father paid  her flying visits, but these were too short to content her.    \"What's five minutes out of a long day?\" she asked. \"It's too bad! When  Mavis used to have bronchitis we all almost lived in her bedroom. Nobody  makes the least fuss about _me_! You don't even look decently sorry  or very sympathetic! You come smiling in as if mumps were a sort of joke.  It isn't a smiling matter to me, I can tell you. I'm fed up with them!\"    \"Poor old lady! It's a shame to laugh at your big face! Shall I cry  instead?\" said Father.    \"It wouldn't seem quite so heartless!\" retorted his indignant patient.    Next day Merle received a letter, which was pushed under the door. It was  all in rhyme, and as it was in Dr. Ramsay's handwriting she concluded  that her father must have sat up late the night before courting the muse  of poetry. His verses ran as follows:      MERLE WITH MUMPS      When Merle was suffering from the mumps    She felt most down and in the dumps;    Her friends, to cheer her up the while,    Laughed at her face to make her smile.      But eyeing with reproach her folk    She told them 'twas a sorry joke.    \"Hard-hearted wretches,\" so she cried,    \"To jeer while here upstairs I bide!\"      Having no bad intent to tease her,    But wishing only just to please her,    Her family then ceased their jeers    And showed their sympathy in tears.      Her mother, who her pillow set,    Dropped tears and made the room quite wet,    And gurgled forth, \"Alack-a-day,    That here upstairs with mumps you stay!\"      Her uncle just outside the door    Sobbed till his chest was hoarse and sore,    And, swallowing in his throat some lumps,    He mourned, \"My Niece has got the mumps\"      The maids who came her plight to see    Splashed tears in cups of milk or tea;    The room it grew so very damp    Her limbs began to feel the cramp.      Her father to her chamber crept,    And lifted up his voice and wept;    With kerchief of capacious size    He stood and groaned and mopped his eyes.      So big the tears that from him fell    They were enough to make a well,    And, standing in a pool of water,    He sighed, \"Alack! my mumpsy daughter!\"      \"Stop! Stop!\" cried Merle, \"O don't be sad!    These waterworks will drive me mad!    Good gracious, how I wish you'd smile    Instead of weeping all the while!      \"Cheer up, for goodness' sake, I pray,    And treat me in your usual way.    No more I'll call you hearts of leather,    In spite of mumps we'll laugh together!\"    Perhaps the family thought they had not done enough to relieve the tedium  of Merle's banishment; at any rate they set to work and made great  efforts to amuse her. Mavis sketched her portrait, adding wings and a  halo, and printed underneath \"Saint Merle suffering her Martyrdom.\"  Mother clicked away on the typewriter, and deposited a document in her  daughter's room, which claimed to be:    _Extract from \"The Durracombe and Devon Times\"_    SOCIETY GOSSIP    It is with sincere regret that we record the indisposition of that leader  of our local social life, Miss Merle Ramsay. Well known for her dramatic  talent, she lately acted the part of principal boy at an important  performance held in Chagmouth, the Metropolis of the West. Her audience,  which included some of the most celebrated critics and press  representatives of the neighbourhood, was unanimous in acknowledging her  spirited conception of what was certainly a difficult and delicate role,  which, in less skilled hands than hers, might have degenerated into  buffoonery or sheer melodrama. She was greatly to be congratulated on her  achievement, and it is hoped this is not the last time she will appear on  the boards and give Devon audiences the opportunity of enjoying her rare  humour. It may be noted that, in addition to her powers of dramatic  representation, Miss Ramsay has no mean record in the world of sport.    Her athletic proclivities are marked, and she has the distinguished  honour of being president of the Games Club at that great west country  centre of education 'The Moorings.' Among her many activities Miss Ramsay  numbers a facility in music and an affection for horticulture; she has  travelled much in the immediate neighbourhood of Durracombe, and her  favourite hobby is motoring.    Miss Ramsay, who through the nature of her indisposition was unable to  afford our press representative a personal interview, sent messages of  thanks for the local sympathy expressed for her condition.    \"It is a matter of much gratification to me to know that I am missed,\"  were her words; \"I trust soon to be back at work and to be able to fulfil  my many engagements.\" At the request of the local Entertainments  Committee we are asked to state that, owing to the absence of their most  prominent member, no further performances will be given for the present.  We wish Miss Ramsay a speedy return to health.    Merle laughed very much over these literary effusions, and they certainly  had the effect of cheering her up. What she pined for chiefly, however,  was company. She had a very sociable disposition and hated to be alone.  She particularly missed Clive, who had grown to be her best playfellow.  She begged for the dog or the cat to"]]]
