But the hopes of Laski were not easily extinguished. Already, in  idea, the possessor of countless millions, he was not to be cast down  for fear of present expenses. He thus continued from day to day, and  from month to month, till he was, at last, obliged to sell a portion of  his deeply-mortgaged estates, to find aliment for the hungry crucibles  of Dee and Kelly, and the no less hungry stomachs of their wives and  families. It was not till ruin stared him in the face, that he awoke  from his dream of infatuation--too happy, even then, to find that he had  escaped utter beggary. Thus restored to his senses, his first thought  was how to rid himself of his expensive visiters. Not wishing to  quarrel with them, he proposed that they should proceed to Prague, well  furnished with letters of recommendation to the Emperor Rudolph. Our  alchymists too plainly saw that nothing more was to be made of the  almost destitute Count Laski. Without hesitation, therefore, they  accepted the proposal, and set out forthwith to the Imperial residence.  They had no difficulty, on their arrival at Prague, in obtaining an  audience of the Emperor. They found him willing enough to believe  that such a thing as the philosopher's stone existed, and flattered  themselves that they had made a favourable impression upon him; but,  from some cause or other--perhaps the look of low cunning and quackery  upon the face of Kelly--the Emperor conceived no very high opinion of  their abilities. He allowed them, however, to remain for some months at  Prague, feeding themselves upon the hope that he would employ them: but  the more he saw of them, the less he liked them; and, when the Pope's  Nuncio represented to him, that he ought not to countenance such heretic  magicians, he gave orders that they should quit his dominions within  four-and-twenty hours. It was fortunate for them that so little time  was given them; for, had they remained six hours longer, the Nuncio had  received orders to procure a perpetual dungeon, or the stake, for them.    Not knowing well where to direct their steps, they resolved to return to  Cracow, where they had still a few friends; but, by this time, the funds  they had drawn from Laski were almost exhausted; and they were many days  obliged to go dinnerless and supperless. They had great difficulty to  keep their poverty a secret from the world; but they managed to bear  privation without murmuring, from a conviction that if the fact were  known, it would militate very much against their pretensions. Nobody  would believe that they were possessors of the philosopher's stone, if  it were once suspected that they did not know how to procure bread for  their subsistence. They still gained a little by casting nativities, and  kept starvation at arm's length, till a new dupe, rich enough for their  purposes, dropped into their toils, in the shape of a royal personage.  Having procured an introduction to Stephen, King of Poland,  they predicted to him, that the Emperor Rudolph would shortly be  assassinated, and that the Germans would look to Poland for his  successor. As this prediction was not precise enough to satisfy the  King, they tried their crystal again; and a spirit appeared, who told  them that the new sovereign of Germany would be Stephen of Poland.  Stephen was credulous enough to believe them, and was once present when  Kelly held his mystic conversations with the shadows of his crystal.  He also appears to have furnished them with money to carry on their  experiments in alchymy: but he grew tired, at last, of their broken  promises, and their constant drains upon his pocket; and was on the  point of discarding them with disgrace, when they met with another  dupe, to whom they eagerly transferred their services. This was Count  Rosenberg, a nobleman of large estates, at Trebona, in Bohemia. So  comfortable did they find themselves in the palace of this munificent  patron, that they remained nearly four years with him, faring  sumptuously, and having an almost unlimited command of his money. The  Count was more ambitious than avaricious: he had wealth enough, and did  not care for the philosopher's stone on account of the gold, but of  the length of days it would bring him. They had their predictions,  accordingly, all ready framed to suit his character. They prophesied  that he should be chosen King of Poland; and promised, moreover, that  he should live for five hundred years to enjoy his dignity; provided  always, that he found them sufficient money to carry on their  experiments.    But now, while fortune smiled upon them; while they revelled in the  rewards of successful villany, retributive justice came upon them in a  shape they had not anticipated. Jealousy and mistrust sprang up between  the two confederates, and led to such violent and frequent quarrels,  that Dee was in constant fear of exposure. Kelly imagined himself a much  greater personage than Dee; measuring, most likely, by the standard of  impudent roguery; and was displeased that on all occasions, and from all  persons, Dee received the greater share of honour and consideration. He  often threatened to leave Dee to shift for himself; and the latter, who  had degenerated into the mere tool of his more daring associate, was  distressed beyond measure at the prospect of his desertion. His mind was  so deeply imbued with superstition, that he believed the rhapsodies  of Kelly to be, in a great measure, derived from his intercourse with  angels; and he knew not where, in the whole world, to look for a man  of depth and wisdom enough to succeed him. As their quarrels every day  became more and more frequent, Dee wrote letters to Queen Elizabeth,  to secure a favourable reception on his return to England; whither he  intended to proceed, if Kelly forsook him. He also sent her a round  piece of silver, which he pretended he had made of a portion of brass  cut out of a warming-pan. He afterwards sent her the warming-pan also,  that she might convince herself that the piece of silver corresponded  exactly with the hole which was cut into the brass. While thus preparing  for the worst, his chief desire was to remain in Bohemia with Count  Rosenberg, who treated him well, and reposed much confidence in him.  Neither had Kelly any great objection to remain; but a new passion  had taken possession of his breast, and he was laying deep schemes to  gratify it. His own wife was ill-favoured and ill-natured; Dee's was  comely and agreeable: and he longed to make an exchange of partners,  without exciting the jealousy or shocking the morality of Dee. This was  a difficult matter; but, to a man like Kelly, who was as deficient in  rectitude and right feeling as he was full of impudence and ingenuity,  the difficulty was not insurmountable. He had also deeply studied the  character and the foibles of Dee; and he took his measures accordingly.  The next time they consulted the spirits, Kelly pretended to be shocked  at their language, and refused to tell Dee what they had said. Dee  insisted, and was informed that they were henceforth to have their wives  in common. Dee, a little startled, inquired whether the spirits might  not mean that they were to live in common harmony and good-will? Kelly  tried again, with apparent reluctance, and said the spirits insisted  upon the literal interpretation. The poor fanatic, Dee, resigned himself  to their will; but it suited Kelly's purpose to appear coy a little  longer. He declared that the spirits must be spirits, not of good, but  of evil; and refused to consult them any more. He thereupon took his  departure, saying that he would never return.    Dee, thus left to himself, was in sore trouble and distress of mind.  He knew not on whom to fix as the successor to Kelly for consulting the  spirits; but at last chose his son Arthur, a boy of eight years of age.  He consecrated him to this service with great ceremony, and impressed  upon the child's mind the dignified and awful nature of the duties  he was called upon to perform; but the poor boy had neither the  imagination, the faith, nor the artifice of Kelly. He looked intently  upon the crystal, as he was told; but could see nothing and hear  nothing. At last, when his eyes ached, he said he could see a vague  indistinct shadow; but nothing more. Dee was in despair. The deception  had been carried on so long, that he was never so happy as when he  fancied he was holding converse with superior beings; and he cursed the  day that had put estrangement between him and his dear friend Kelly.  This was exactly what Kelly had foreseen; and, when he thought  the Doctor had grieved sufficiently for his absence, he returned  unexpectedly, and entered the room where the little Arthur was in vain  endeavouring to distinguish something in the crystal. Dee, in entering  this circumstance in his journal, ascribes this sudden return to a  \"miraculous fortune,\" and a \"divine fate;\" and goes on to record that  Kelly immediately saw the spirits, which had remained invisible to  little Arthur. One of these spirits reiterated the previous command,  that they should have their wives in common. Kelly bowed his head, and  submitted; and Dee, in all humility, consented to the arrangement.    This was the extreme depth of the wretched man's degradation. In this  manner they continued to live for three or four months, when, new  quarrels breaking out, they separated once more. This time their  separation was final. Kelly, taking the elixir which he had found in  Glastonbury Abbey, proceeded to Prague, forgetful of the abrupt mode in  which he had previously been expelled from that city. Almost immediately  after his arrival, he was seized by order of the Emperor Rudolph, and  thrown into prison.

Among the foliage of low shrubbery and plants in  shady lanes and woodside thickets, we see the delicate, drooping  clusters of lilac blossoms hanging where bees can readily discover them  and, in pilfering their sweets, transfer their pollen from flower to  flower. But in case of failure to intercross these blossoms that are  dependent upon insect help to set fertile seed, what then? Must the  plant run the risk of extinction? Self-fertilization may be an evil,  but failure to produce seed at all is surely the greatest one. To guard  against such a calamity, insignificant looking flowers that have no  petals to open for the enticing of insects, but which fertilize  themselves with their own pollen, produce abundant seed close to the  ground or under it. Then what need of the showy blossoms hanging in the  thicket above? Close inbreeding in the vegetable world, as in the  animal, ultimately produces degenerate offspring; and although the showy  lilac blossoms of the wild peanut yield comparatively few  cross-fertilized seeds, these are quite sufficient to enable the vine to  maintain those desired features which are the inheritance from ancestors  that struggled in their day and generation after perfection. No plant  dares depend upon its cleistogamous or blind flowers alone for  offspring; and in the sixty or more genera containing these curious  growths, that usually look like buds arrested in development, every  plant that bears them bears also showy flowers dependent upon  cross-pollination by insect aid.    The boy who:          \"Drives home the cows from the pasture    Up through the long shady lane\"    knows how reluctantly they leave the feast afforded by the wild peanut.  Hogs, rooting about in the moist soil where it grows, unearth the hairy  pods that should produce next year's vines; hence the poor excuse for  branding a charming plant with a repellent folk-name.    This plant should not be confused with pig-nut (_carya porcina_), which  is a species of hickory.          WOOD-SORREL FAMILY _(Oxalidaceae)_      White or True Wood-sorrel; Alleluia    _Oxalis acetosella_    _Flowers_--White or delicate pink, veined with deep pink, about 1/2 in.  long. Five sepals; 5 spreading petals rounded at tips; 10 stamens, 5  longer, 5 shorter, all anther-bearing; 1 pistil with 5 stigmatic styles.  _Scape:_ Slender, leafless, 1-flowered, 2 to 5 in. high. _Leaf:_  Clover-like, of 3 leaflets, on long petioles from scaly, creeping  rootstock.    _Preferred Habitat_--Cold, damp woods.    _Flowering Season_--May-July.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia and Manitoba, southward to North Carolina.  Also a native of Europe.    Clumps of these delicate little pinkish blossoms and abundant leaves,  cuddled close to the cold earth of northern forests, usually conceal  near the dry leaves or moss from which they spring blind flowers that  never open--cleistogamous the botanists call them--flowers that lack  petals, as if they were immature buds; that lack odor, nectar, and  entrance; yet they are perfectly mature, self-fertilized, and abundantly  fruitful. Fifty-five genera of plants contain one or more species on  which these peculiar products are found, the pea family having more than  any other, although violets offer perhaps the most familiar instance to  most of us. Many of these species bury their offspring below ground; but  the wood-sorrel bears its blind flowers nodding from the top of a  curved scape at the base of the plant, where we can readily find them.  By having no petals, and other features assumed by an ordinary flower to  attract insects, and chiefly in saving pollen, they produce seed with  literally the closest economy. It is estimated that the average blind  flower of the wood-sorrel does its work with four hundred pollen grains,  while the prodigal peony scatters with the help of wind and insect  visitors more than three and a half millions!    As self-fertilization is impossible, the showy blossoms of the  wood-sorrel are a necessity not a luxury; for the insects must not be  allowed to overlook them.    Every child knows how the wood-sorrel \"goes to sleep\" by drooping its  three leaflets until they touch back to back at evening, regaining the  horizontal at sunrise--a performance most scientists now agree protects  the peculiarly sensitive leaf from cold by radiation. During the day as  well, seedling, scape, and leaves go through some interesting movements,  closely followed by Darwin in his \"Power of Movement in Plants,\" which  should be read by all interested.    _Oxalis_, the Greek for sour, applies to all sorrels because of their  acid juice; but _acetosella_ = vinegar salt, the specific name of this  plant, indicates that from it druggists obtain salt of lemons. Twenty  pounds of leaves yield between two and three ounces of oxalic acid by  crystallization. Names locally given the plant in the Old World are wood  sour or sower, cuckoo's meat, sour trefoil, and shamrock--for this is  St. Patrick's own flower, the true shamrock of the ancient Irish, some  claim. Alleluia, another folk-name, refers to the joyousness of the  Easter season, when the plant comes into bloom in England.      Violet Wood-sorrel    _Oxalis violacea_    _Flowers_--Pinkish purple, lavender, or pale magenta; less than 1 in.  long; borne on slender stems in umbels or forking clusters, each  containing from 3 to 12 flowers. Calyx of 5 obtuse sepals; 5 petals; 10  (5 longer, 5 shorter) stamens; 5 styles persistent above 5-celled ovary.  _Stem:_ From brownish, scaly bulb 4 to 9 in. high. _Leaves:_ About 1 in.  wide, compounded of 3 rounded, clover-like leaflets with prominent  midrib borne at end of slender petioles, springing from root.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rocky and sandy woods.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--Northern United States to Rocky Mountains, south to  Florida and New Mexico; more abundant southward.    Beauty of leaf and blossom is not the only attraction possessed by this  charming little plant. As a family the wood-sorrels have great interest  for botanists since Darwin devoted such exhaustive study to their power  of movement, and many other scientists have described the several forms  assumed by perfect flowers of the same species to secure  cross-fertilization. Some members of the clan also bear blind flowers,  which have been described in the account of the white wood-sorrel. Even  the rudimentary leaves of the seedlings \"go to sleep\" at evening, and  during the day are in constant movement up and down. The stems, too, are  restless; and as for the mature leaves, every child knows how they droop  their three leaflets back to back against the stem at evening,  elevating them to the perfect horizontal again by day. Extreme  sensitiveness to light has been thought to be the true explanation of so  much activity, and yet this is not a satisfactory theory in many cases.  It is certain that drooping leaves suffer far less from frost than those  whose upper surfaces are flatly exposed to the zenith. This view that  the sleep of leaves saves them from being chilled at night by radiation  is Darwin's own, supported by innumerable experiments; and probably it  would have been advanced by Linnaeus, too, since so many of his  observations in \"Somnus Plantarum\" verify the theory, had the principle  of radiation been discovered in his day.          GERANIUM FAMILY _(Geraniaceae)_    Wild or Spotted Geranium or Crane's-Bill; Alum-root    _Geranium maculatum_    _Flowers_--Pale magenta, purplish pink, or lavender, regular, 1 to 1-1/2  in. broad, solitary or a pair, borne on elongated peduncles, generally  with pair of leaves at their base. Calyx of 5 lapping, pointed sepals; 5  petals, woolly at base; 10 stamens; 1 pistil with 5 styles. _Fruit:_ A  slender capsule pointed like a crane's bill. In maturity it ejects seeds  elastically far from the parent plant. _Stem:_ 1 to 2 ft. high, hairy,  slender, simple or branching above. _Leaves:_ Older ones sometimes  spotted with white; basal ones 3 to 6 in. wide, 3 to 5 parted, variously  cleft and toothed; 2 stem leaves opposite.    _Preferred Habitat_--Open woods, thickets, and shady roadsides.    _Flowering Season_--April-July.    _Distribution_--Newfoundland to Georgia, and westward a thousand miles.    Sprengel, who was the first to exalt flowers above the level of mere  botanical specimens, had his attention led to the intimate relationship  existing between plants and insects by studying out the meaning of the  hairy corolla of the common Wild Geranium of Germany _(G. sylvaticum)_,  being convinced, as he wrote in 1787, that \"the wise Author of Nature  has not made even a single hair without a definite design.\" A hundred  years before, Nehemias Grew had said that it was necessary for pollen to  reach the stigma of a flower in order that it might set fertile seed;  and Linnaeus had to come to his aid with conclusive evidence to convince  a doubting world that this was true. Sprengel made the next step  forward, but his writings lay neglected over seventy years because he  advanced the then incredible and only partially true statement that a  flower is fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers  to its stigma. In spite of his discoveries that the hairs inside the  geranium's corolla protect its nectar from rain for the insect's  benefit, just as eyebrows keep perspiration from falling into the eye;  that most flowers which secrete nectar have what he termed \"honey  guides\"--spots of bright color, heavy veining, or some such pathfinder  on the petals--in spite of the most patient and scientific research that  shed great light on natural selection a half-century before Darwin  advanced the theory, he left it for the author of \"The Origin of  Species\" to show that cross-fertilization--the transfer of pollen from  one blossom to another, not from anthers to stigma of the same  flower--is the"]]]
