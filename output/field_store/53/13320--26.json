If, of two persons side by side, one desired to listen to music and  the other to sleep, it could be made audible to one and inaudible to  another.    \"I should strongly advise you to sleep if you can to-night, Mr. West,  in preference to listening to the finest tunes in the world,\" the  doctor said, after explaining these points. \"In the trying experience  you are just now passing through, sleep is a nerve tonic for which  there is no substitute.\"    Mindful of what had happened to me that very morning, I promised to  heed his counsel.    \"Very well,\" he said, \"then I will set the telephone at eight o'clock.\"    \"What do you mean?\" I asked.    He explained that, by a clock-work combination, a person could arrange  to be awakened at any hour by the music.    It began to appear, as has since fully proved to be the case, that I  had left my tendency to insomnia behind me with the other discomforts  of existence in the nineteenth century; for though I took no sleeping  draught this time, yet, as the night before, I had no sooner touched  the pillow than I was asleep.    I dreamed that I sat on the throne of the Abencerrages in the  banqueting hall of the Alhambra, feasting my lords and generals, who  next day were to follow the crescent against the Christian dogs of  Spain. The air, cooled by the spray of fountains, was heavy with the  scent of flowers. A band of Nautch girls, round-limbed and  luscious-lipped, danced with voluptuous grace to the music of brazen  and stringed instruments. Looking up to the latticed galleries, one  caught a gleam now and then from the eye of some beauty of the royal  harem, looking down upon the assembled flower of Moorish chivalry.  Louder and louder clashed the cymbals, wilder and wilder grew the  strain, till the blood of the desert race could no longer resist the  martial delirium, and the swart nobles leaped to their feet; a thousand  scimetars were bared, and the cry, \"Allah il Allah!\" shook the hall and  awoke me, to find it broad daylight, and the room tingling with the  electric music of the \"Turkish Reveille.\"    At the breakfast-table, when I told my host of my morning's experience,  I learned that it was not a mere chance that the piece of music which  awakened me was a reveille. The airs played at one of the halls during  the waking hours of the morning were always of an inspiring type.    \"By the way,\" I said, \"I have not thought to ask you anything about the  state of Europe. Have the societies of the Old World also been  remodeled?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"the great nations of Europe as well as  Australia, Mexico, and parts of South America, are now organized  industrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the  evolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a  loose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international  council regulates the mutual intercourse and commerce of the members of  the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races, which  are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions. Complete  autonomy within its own limits is enjoyed by every nation.\"    \"How do you carry on commerce without money?\" I said. \"In trading with  other nations, you must use some sort of money, although you dispense  with it in the internal affairs of the nation.\"    \"Oh, no; money is as superfluous in our foreign as in our internal  relations. When foreign commerce was conducted by private enterprise,  money was necessary to adjust it on account of the multifarious  complexity of the transactions; but nowadays it is a function of the  nations as units. There are thus only a dozen or so merchants in the  world, and their business being supervised by the international  council, a simple system of book accounts serves perfectly to regulate  their dealings. Customs duties of every sort are of course superfluous.  A nation simply does not import what its government does not think  requisite for the general interest. Each nation has a bureau of foreign  exchange, which manages its trading. For example, the American bureau,  estimating such and such quantities of French goods necessary to  America for a given year, sends the order to the French bureau, which  in turn sends its order to our bureau. The same is done mutually by all  the nations.\"    \"But how are the prices of foreign goods settled, since there is no  competition?\"    \"The price at which one nation supplies another with goods,\" replied  Dr. Leete, \"must be that at which it supplies its own citizens. So you  see there is no danger of misunderstanding. Of course no nation is  theoretically bound to supply another with the product of its own  labor, but it is for the interest of all to exchange some commodities.  If a nation is regularly supplying another with certain goods, notice  is required from either side of any important change in the relation.\"    \"But what if a nation, having a monopoly of some natural product,  should refuse to supply it to the others, or to one of them?\"    \"Such a case has never occurred, and could not without doing the  refusing party vastly more harm than the others,\" replied Dr. Leete.  \"In the fist place, no favoritism could be legally shown. The law  requires that each nation shall deal with the others, in all respects,  on exactly the same footing. Such a course as you suggest would cut off  the nation adopting it from the remainder of the earth for all purposes  whatever. The contingency is one that need not give us much anxiety.\"    \"But,\" said I, \"supposing a nation, having a natural monopoly in some  product of which it exports more than it consumes, should put the price  away up, and thus, without cutting off the supply, make a profit out of  its neighbors' necessities? Its own citizens would of course have to  pay the higher price on that commodity, but as a body would make more  out of foreigners than they would be out of pocket themselves.\"    \"When you come to know how prices of all commodities are determined  nowadays, you will perceive how impossible it is that they could be  altered, except with reference to the amount or arduousness of the work  required respectively to produce them,\" was Dr. Leete's reply. \"This  principle is an international as well as a national guarantee; but even  without it the sense of community of interest, international as well as  national, and the conviction of the folly of selfishness, are too deep  nowadays to render possible such a piece of sharp practice as you  apprehend. You must understand that we all look forward to an eventual  unification of the world as one nation. That, no doubt, will be the  ultimate form of society, and will realize certain economic advantages  over the present federal system of autonomous nations. Meanwhile,  however, the present system works so nearly perfectly that we are quite  content to leave to posterity the completion of the scheme. There are,  indeed, some who hold that it never will be completed, on the ground  that the federal plan is not merely a provisional solution of the  problem of human society, but the best ultimate solution.\"    \"How do you manage,\" I asked, \"when the books of any two nations do not  balance? Supposing we import more from France than we export to her.\"    \"At the end of each year,\" replied the doctor, \"the books of every  nation are examined. If France is found in our debt, probably we are in  the debt of some nation which owes France, and so on with all the  nations. The balances that remain after the accounts have been cleared  by the international council should not be large under our system.  Whatever they may be, the council requires them to be settled every few  years, and may require their settlement at any time if they are getting  too large; for it is not intended that any nation shall run largely in  debt to another, lest feelings unfavorable to amity should be  engendered. To guard further against this, the international council  inspects the commodities interchanged by the nations, to see that they  are of perfect quality.\"    \"But what are the balances finally settled with, seeing that you have  no money?\"    \"In national staples; a basis of agreement as to what staples shall be  accepted, and in what proportions, for settlement of accounts, being a  preliminary to trade relations.\"    \"Emigration is another point I want to ask you about,\" said I. \"With  every nation organized as a close industrial partnership, monopolizing  all means of production in the country, the emigrant, even if he were  permitted to land, would starve. I suppose there is no emigration  nowadays.\"    \"On the contrary, there is constant emigration, by which I suppose you  mean removal to foreign countries for permanent residence,\" replied Dr.  Leete. \"It is arranged on a simple international arrangement of  indemnities. For example, if a man at twenty-one emigrates from England  to America, England loses all the expense of his maintenance and  education, and America gets a workman for nothing. America accordingly  makes England an allowance. The same principle, varied to suit the  case, applies generally. If the man is near the term of his labor when  he emigrates, the country receiving him has the allowance. As to  imbecile persons, it is deemed best that each nation should be  responsible for its own, and the emigration of such must be under full  guarantees of support by his own nation. Subject to these regulations,  the right of any man to emigrate at any time is unrestricted.\"    \"But how about mere pleasure trips; tours of observation? How can a  stranger travel in a country whose people do not receive money, and are  themselves supplied with the means of life on a basis not extended to  him? His own credit card cannot, of course,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#19)"],[1," meantime, but Dicky sat calmly, almost drowsily, smoking, and  Selamlik Pasha sat with greasy hands clasping and unclasping, his yellow  eyes fixed on Dicky with malevolent scrutiny.    When the coffee was brought, the door had been shut, and Dicky had drawn  the curtain across, Selamlik Pasha said: \"What great affair brings us  together here, saadat el basha?\"    \"The matter of the Englishman you hold a prisoner, Excellency.\"    \"It is painful, but he is dead,\" said the Pasha, with a grimace of  cruelty.    Dicky's eyes twitched slightly, but he answered with coolness, thrusting  his elbow into the cushions and smoking hard: \"But, no, he is not dead.  Selamlik Pasha has as great an instinct for a bargain as for revenge.  Also Selamlik Pasha would torture before he kills. Is it not so?\"    \"What is your wish?\"    \"That the man be set free, Excellency.\"    \"He has trespassed. He has stolen his way into the harem. The infidel  dog has defiled the house of my wives.\"    \"He will marry the woman, with your permission, Excellency. He loved  her--so it would seem.\"    \"He shall die--the dog of an infidel!\"    Dicky was now satisfied that Sowerby was alive, and that the game was  fairly begun. He moved slowly towards his purpose.    \"I ask his life, as a favour to me. The Khedive honours me, and I can  serve you betimes, Excellency.\"    \"You called me 'Trousers,' and all Egypt laughed,\" answered the Pasha  malignantly.    \"I might have called you worse, but I did not. You may call me what you  will--I will laugh.\"    \"I will call you a fool for bringing me here to laugh at you, who now  would kiss Selamlik Pasha's shoe. I would he were your brother. I would  tear out his fingernails, pierce his eyes, burn him with hot irons, pour  boiling oil over him and red cinders down his throat--if he were your  brother.\"    \"Remember I am in the confidence of the Khedive, Pasha.\"    \"Ismail! What dare he do? Every Egyptian in the land would call him  infidel. Ismail would dare do nothing.\" His voice was angrily guttural  with triumph.    \"England will ask the price of the young man's life of you, Excellency.\"    \"England dare not move--is thy servant a fool? Every Mussulman in the  land would raise the green flag--the Jehad would be upon ye!\"    \"He is so young. He meant no ill. The face of your daughter drew him on.  He did not realise his crimen--or its penalty.\"    \"It is a fool's reasoning. Because he was a stranger and an infidel, so  has he been told of dark things done to those who desecrate our faith.\"    \"Had he been an Egyptian or a Turk--\"    \"I should slay him, were he Ismail himself. Mine own is mine own, as  Mahomet hath said. The man shall die--and who shall save him? Not even  the Sultan himself.\"    \"There are concessions in the Fayoum--you have sought them long.\"    \"Bah!\"    \"There is the Grand Cordon of the Mejidieh; there is a way to it,  Excellency.\"    \"The man's blood!\"    \"There is a high office to be vacant soon, near to the person of the  Khedive, with divers moneys and loans--\"    \"To see Donovan Pasha cringe and beg is better.\"    \"There is that mercy which one day you may have to ask for yourself or  for your own--\"    \"The fool shall die. And who shall save him?\"    \"Well, I will save him,\" said Dicky, rising slowly to his feet.    \"Pish! Go to the Khedive with the tale, and I will kill the man within  the hour, and tell it abroad, and we shall see where Donovan Pasha will  stand to-morrow. The Khedive is not stronger than his people--and there  are the French, and others!\" He spat upon the floor at Dicky's feet.  \"Go, tell the Khedive what you will, dog of an Englishman, son of a dog  with a dog's heart!\" Dicky took a step forward, with an ominous flare of  colour in his cheek. There was a table between him and Selamlik Pasha.  He put both hands upon it, and leaning over said in a voice of steel:    \"So be it, then. Shall I go to the Khedive and say that this night  Mustapha Bey, eldest and chosen son of Selamlik Pasha, the darling of  his fat heart, was seized by the Chief Eunuch, the gentle Mizraim, in  the harem of his Highness? Shall I tell him that, Trousers?\"    As Dicky spoke, slowly, calmly, Selamlik Pasha turned a greenish-yellow,  his eyes started from his head, his hand chafed the air.    \"Mustapha Bey--Khedive's harem!\" he stammered in a husky voice.    \"By the gentle Mizraim, I said,\" answered Dicky. \"Is Mustapha Bey's life  worth an hour's purchase? Is Selamlik Pasha safe?\"    \"Is--is he dead?\" gasped the cowardly Egyptian, furtively glancing  towards the door. Suddenly he fell back fainting, and Dicky threw some  water in his face, then set a cup of it beside him.    \"Drink, and pull yourself together, if you would save yourself,\" said  Dicky.    \"Save--save myself,\" said Selamlik Pasha, recovering; then, with quick  suspicion, and to gain time, added quickly: \"Ah, it is a trick! He is  not a prisoner--you lie!\"    \"I have not a reputation for lying,\" rejoined Dicky quietly. \"But see!\"  he added; and throwing open a door, pointed to where the Chief Eunuch  stood with Mahommed Yeleb, Mustapha Bey gagged and bound between them.  Dicky shut the door again, as Selamlik Pasha shrank back among the  cushions, cowardice incarnate.    \"You thought,\" said Dicky with a soft fierceness, \"you thought that I  would stoop to bargain with Selamlik Pasha and not know my way out of  the bargain? You thought an Englishman would beg, even for a life, of  such as you! You thought me, Donovan Pasha, such a fool!\"    \"Mercy, Excellency!\" said Selamlik, spreading out his hands.    Dicky laughed. \"You called me names, Selamlik--a dog, and the son of a  dog with a dog's heart. Was it wise?\"    \"Is there no way? Can no bargain be made?\"    Dicky sat down, lighting a cigarette.    \"To save a scandal in Egypt,\" answered Dicky drily, \"I am ready to grant  you terms.\"    \"Speak-Excellency.\"    \"The life of the Englishman for the life of your son and your own. Also,  the freedom of the six Circassian slaves whom you house now at Beni  Hassan, ready to bring to your palace. Also, for these slaves two  hundred Turkish pounds apiece. Also, your written word that you will  bring no more slaves into Egypt. Is the bargain fair?\"    \"Mizraim may still betray us,\" said Selamlik, trembling, with relief,  but yet apprehensive.    \"Mizraim is in my power--he acts for me,\" said Dicky. \"Whose life is  safe here save my own?\"    \"Malaish! It shall be as your will is, Excellency,\" answered Selamlik  Pasha, in a shaking voice; and he had time to wonder even then how an  Englishman could so outwit an Oriental. It was no matter how Mustapha  Bey, his son, was lured; he had been seized in the harem, and all truth  can be forsworn in Egypt, and the game was with this Donovan Pasha.    \"Send to your palace, commanding that the Englishman be brought here,\"  said Dicky. Selamlik Pasha did so.    Sowerby of the Mounted Infantry was freed that night, and the next day  Dicky Donovan had six Circassian slaves upon his hands. He passed them  over to the wife of Fielding Bey with whom he had shared past secrets  and past dangers.    Selamlik Pasha held his peace in fear; and the Khedive and Cairo never  knew why there was a truce to battle between Dicky Donovan and that vile  Pasha called Trousers.          AT THE MERCY OF TIBERIUS    In a certain year when Dicky Donovan was the one being in Egypt who had  any restraining influence on the Khedive, he suddenly asked leave of  absence to visit England. Ismail granted it with reluctance, chiefly  because he disliked any interference with his comforts, and Dicky was  one of them--in some respects the most important.    \"My friend,\" he said half petulantly to Dicky, as he tossed the plans  for a new palace to his secretary and dismissed him, \"are you not happy  here? Have you not all a prince can give?\"    \"Highness,\" answered Dicky, \"I have kith and kin in England. Shall a man  forget his native land?\" The Khedive yawned, lighted a cigarette, and  murmured through the smoke: \"Inshallah! It might be pleasant--betimes.\"    \"I have your Highness's leave to go?\" asked Dicky. \"May God preserve  your head from harm!\" answered Ismail in farewell salutation, and,  taking a ring from his finger set with a large emerald, he gave it to  Dicky. \"Gold is scarce in Egypt,\" he went on, \"but there are jewels  still in the palace--and the Khedive's promises-to-pay with every  money-barber of Europe!\" he added, with a cynical sneer, and touched his  forehead and his breast courteously as Dicky retired.    Outside the presence Dicky unbuttoned his coat like an Englishman again,  and ten minutes later flung his tarboosh into a corner of the room; for  the tarboosh was the sign of official servitude, and Dicky was never  the perfect official. Initiative was his strong point, independence his  life; he loathed the machine of system in so far as he could not command  it; he revolted at being a cog in the wheel. Ismail had discovered this,  and Dicky had been made a kind of confidential secretary who seldom  wrote a line. By his influence with Ismail he had even more power at  last than the Chief Eunuch or the valet-de-chambre, before whom the  highest officials bowed low. He was hated profoundly by many of the  household, cultivated by certain of the Ministers, fawned upon by  outsiders, trusted by the Khedive, and entirely believed in by the few  Englishmen and Frenchmen who worked for decent administration faithfully  but without hope and sometimes with nausea.    It was nausea that had seized upon Dicky at last, nausea and one other  thing--the spirit of adventure, an inveterate curiosity. His was the  instinct of the explorer, his feet were the feet of the Wandering  Jew. He knew things behind closed doors by instinct; he was like a  thought-reader in the sure touch of discovery; the Khedive looked upon  him as occult almost and laughed in the face of Sadik the Mouffetish  when he said some evil things of"]]]
