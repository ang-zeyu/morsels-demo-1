Neither must Athens be regarded as a democracy in the modern sense. She  was only so by contrast with Persia or with Sparta. Not every man in the  beautiful city voted, or enjoyed the riches that flowed into her  coffers, and could thus afford, free from pecuniary care, to devote  himself to art. Athens probably had never more than thirty thousand  \"citizens.\" The rest of the adult male population, vastly outnumbering  these, were slaves, or foreigners attracted by the city's splendor.    But those thirty thousand were certainly men. \"There were giants in  those days.\" One sometimes stands in wonder at their boldness. What all  Greece could not do, what Persia had completely failed in, they  undertook. Athens alone should conquer the world. By force of arms they  would found an empire of intellect. They fought Persia and Sparta, both  at once. Plague swept their city, yet they would not yield.[2] Their own  subject allies turned against them; and they fought those too. They sent  fleets and armies against Syracuse, the mightiest power of the West. It  was Athens against all mankind!    [Footnote 2: See _Great Plague at Athens_, page 34.]    She was unequal to the task, superbly unequal to it. The destruction of  her army at Syracuse[3] was only the foremost of a series of inevitable  disasters, which left her helpless. After that, Sparta, and then Thebes,  became the leading city of Greece. Athens slowly regained her fighting  strength; her intellectual supremacy she had not lost. Socrates,[4]  greatest of her sons, endeavored to teach a morality higher than earth  had yet received, higher than his contemporaries could grasp. Plato gave  to thought a scientific basis.    [Footnote 3: See _Defeat of the Athenians at Syracuse_, page 48.]    [Footnote 4: See _Condemnation and Death of Socrates_, page 87.]    Then Macedonia, a border kingdom of ancient kinship to the Greeks, but  not recognized as belonging among them, began to obtrude herself in  their affairs, and at length won that leadership for which they had all  contended. A hundred and fifty years had elapsed since the Greeks had  stood united against Persia. During all that time their strength had  been turned against themselves. Now at last the internecine wars were  checked, and all the power of the sturdy race was directed by one man,  Alexander, King of Macedon. Democracy had made the Greeks intellectually  glorious, but politically weak. Monarchy rose from the ruin they had  wrought.    As though that ancient invasion of Xerxes had been a crime of yesterday,  Alexander proclaimed his intention of avenging it; and the Greeks  applauded. They understood Persia now far better than in the elder days;  they saw what a feeble mass the huge heterogeneous empire had become.  Its people were slaves, its soldiers mercenaries. The Greeks themselves  had been hired to suppress more than one Persian rebellion,[5] and to  foment these also. They had learned the enormous advantage their  stronger personality gave them against the masses of sheeplike Asiatics.    [Footnote 5: See _Retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks_, page 68.]    So it was in holiday mood that they followed Alexander, and in schoolboy  roughness that they trampled on the civilization of the East. In fact,  it is worth noting that the most vigorous resistance they encountered  was not from the Persians, but from a remnant of the Semites, the  merchants of the Phoenician city of Tyre.[6] In less than eight years,  B.C. 331-323, Alexander overran the whole known world of the East,[7]  only stopping when, on the border of India, his soldiers broke into open  revolt, not against fighting, but against further wandering.    [Footnote 6: See _Alexander Reduces Tyre_, page 133.]    [Footnote 7: See _The Battle of Arbela_, page 141.]    If this invasion had been the mere outcome of one man's ambition, it  might scarce be worth recording. But Alexander was only the topmost wave  in the surging of a long imminent, inevitable racial movement. Its  effect upon civilization, upon the world, was incalculably vast.  Alexander and his successors were city-builders, administrators. As such  they spread Greek culture, the Greek idea of individualism, over all  their world.    How deep was the change, made upon the imbruted Asiatics, we may perhaps  question. Our own age has seen how much of education may be lavished on  an inferior race without materially altering the brute instincts within.  The building-up of the soul in man is not a matter of individuals, but  of centuries. Yet in at least a superficial way Greek thought became the  thought of all mankind. We may dismiss Alexander's savage conquests with  a sigh of pity; but we cannot deny him recognition as a most potent  teacher of the world.    His empire did not last. It was in too obvious opposition to all that we  have recognized as the Grecian spirit. At his death the same impulse  seems to have stirred each one of his subordinates, to snatch for  himself a kingdom from the confusion. Instead of one there were soon  three, four, and then a dozen semi-Grecian states in Asia. The Greek  element in each grew very faint.    From this time onward Asia takes a less prominent place in world  affairs. Her ancient leadership in the march of civilization had long  been yielded to the Greeks. Now her semblance of military power  disappeared as well. Only two further happenings in all Asia seem worth  noting, down to the birth of Christ. One of these was the Tartar  conquest of China, an event which coalesced the Tartars, helped make  them a nation.[8] It was thus fraught with most disastrous consequences  for the Europe of the future. The other was the revolt of the Hebrews  under Judas Maccabaeus, against their Grecian rulers. This was a  religious revolt, a religious war. Here for the first time we find a  people who will believe, who can believe, in no god but their own, who  will die sooner than give worship to another. We approach the borders of  an age where the spirit is more valued than the body, where the mental  is stronger than the physical, where facts are dominated by ideas.[9]    [Footnote 8: See _Tartar Invasion of China_, page 126.]    [Footnote 9: See _Judas Maccabaeus Liberates Judea_, page 245.]    Had Alexander even at the moment of his greatest strength directed his  forces westward instead of east, he would have found a different world  and encountered a sturdier resistance. He himself recognized this, and  during his last years was gathering all the resources of his unwieldy  empire, to hurl them against Carthage and against Italy. What the issue  might have been no man can say. Alexander's death ended forever the  impossible attempt to unite his race. Once more and until the end,  Grecian strength was wasted against itself.    This gave opportunity to the growing powers of the West. Alexander is  scarce gone ere we hear Carthage boasting that the Mediterranean is but  a private lake in her possession. She rules all Western Africa and  Spain, Sardinia and Corsica. She masters the Greeks of Sicily, against  whom Athens failed. Rome is compelled to sign treaties with her as an  inferior.    THE GROWTH OF ROME    Rome was only husbanding her strength; the little republic of B.C. 510  had grown much during the two centuries of Grecian splendor. Her people  had become far better fitted for conquest than their eastern kinsmen. It  is presumable that here too it was the difference of surroundings which  had differentiated the race. The ancient Etrurian (non-Aryan)  civilization on which the Latins intruded, was apparently more advanced  than their own. For centuries their utmost prowess scarce sufficed to  maintain their independence. Thus it was not possible for them to become  too self-satisfied, to stand afar off and look down on their neighbors  with Grecian scorn. The _ego_ was less prominently developed; the  necessity of mutual dependence and united action was more deeply taught.  Their records display less of brilliancy, but more of patient  persistency, than those of Greece, less of spectacular individualism,  more of truly patriotic self-suppression. In Rome, even more than in  Sparta, the \"State\" was everything. During the early days men found  their highest glory in making their city glorious; their proudest boast  was to be \"citizens of Rome.\"    To trace the slow steps by which the tiny republic grew to be mistress  of all Italy would take too long. She settled her internal difficulties  as all such difficulties must be settled, if the race is to progress;  that is, she became more democratic.[10] As the lower classes advanced  in knowledge and intelligence they insisted on a share of the  government. They fought their way to it. They united Rome, mastered the  other Latin cities, and admitted them to partnership in her power. She  conquered the Etruscans and the Samnites. For a moment we find her  almost overwhelmed by an inroad of the wild Celtic tribes from the  forests of Central Europe;[11] but, fortunately for her, the other  Italian states were equally crushed. It was weakness against weakness,  and the Romans retained their foremost place.    [Footnote 10: See _Institution and Fall of the Decemvirate in Rome_,  page 1.]    [Footnote 11: See _Brennus Burns Rome_, page 110.]    Not till more than a century later were they brought into serious  conflict with the Greeks. In the year B.C. 280, Pyrrhus, King of Epirus,  who had won a temporary leadership over a portion of the Grecian land,  undertook the conquest of the West.[12] Fifty years before, Alexander  with far greater power might have been victorious over a feebler Rome.  Pyrrhus failed completely. If the Romans had less dash and a less wide  experience of varied warfare than his followers, they had far more of  true, heroic endurance. The Greeks had reached that stage of individual  culture where they were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#2)"],[1,"of 1093  Bechamel, or French
