No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;  Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth  To leave that ample space, where to return  Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.\"       She then:  \"Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,  I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread  Hinders my entrance here.  Those things alone  Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,  None else, for none are terrible beside.  I am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!  That any suff'rance of your misery  Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire  Assails me.  In high heaven a blessed dame  Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief  That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,  That God's stern judgment to her will inclines.  To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:  \"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid  And I commend him to thee.\"  At her word  Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,  And coming to the place, where I abode  Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,  She thus address'd me: \"Thou true praise of God!  Beatrice!  why is not thy succour lent  To him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave  For thy sake all the multitude admires?  Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,  Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,  Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?\"  Ne'er among men did any with such speed  Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,  As when these words were spoken, I came here,  Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force  Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all  Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings.\"       \"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes  Tearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt  Redoubled zeal to serve thee.  As she will'd,  Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,  Who thy near way across the goodly mount  Prevented.  What is this comes o'er thee then?  Why, why dost thou hang back?  why in thy breast  Harbour vile fear?  why hast not courage there  And noble daring?  Since three maids so blest  Thy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;  And so much certain good my words forebode.\"       As florets, by the frosty air of night  Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,  Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;  So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,  And to my heart such kindly courage ran,  That I as one undaunted soon replied:  \"O full of pity she, who undertook  My succour!  and thou kind who didst perform  So soon her true behest!  With such desire  Thou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,  That my first purpose fully is resum'd.  Lead on: one only will is in us both.  Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.\"       So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,  I enter'd on the deep and woody way.        CANTO III    \"THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:  Through me you pass into eternal pain:  Through me among the people lost for aye.  Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:  To rear me was the task of power divine,  Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.  Before me things create were none, save things  Eternal, and eternal I endure.  All hope abandon ye who enter here.\"       Such characters in colour dim I mark'd  Over a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:  Whereat I thus: \"Master, these words import  Hard meaning.\"  He as one prepar'd replied:  \"Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;  Here be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come  Where I have told thee we shall see the souls  To misery doom'd, who intellectual good  Have lost.\"  And when his hand he had stretch'd forth  To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd,  Into that secret place he led me on.       Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans  Resounded through the air pierc'd by no star,  That e'en I wept at entering.  Various tongues,  Horrible languages, outcries of woe,  Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,  With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,  Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls  Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd,  Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.       I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:  \"O master!  What is this I hear?  What race  Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?\"       He thus to me: \"This miserable fate  Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv'd  Without or praise or blame, with that ill band  Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd  Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves  Were only.  From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,  Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth  Of Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe  Should glory thence with exultation vain.\"       I then: \"Master!  what doth aggrieve them thus,  That they lament so loud?\"  He straight replied:  \"That will I tell thee briefly.  These of death  No hope may entertain: and their blind life  So meanly passes, that all other lots  They envy.  Fame of them the world hath none,  Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.  Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.\"       And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,  Which whirling ran around so rapidly,  That it no pause obtain'd: and following came  Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er  Have thought, that death so many had despoil'd.       When some of these I recogniz'd, I saw  And knew the shade of him, who to base fear  Yielding, abjur'd his high estate.  Forthwith  I understood for certain this the tribe  Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing  And to his foes.  These wretches, who ne'er lived,  Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung  By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks  With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,  And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.       Then looking farther onwards I beheld  A throng upon the shore of a great stream:  Whereat I thus: \"Sir!  grant me now to know  Whom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem  So eager to pass o'er, as I discern  Through the blear light?\"  He thus to me in few:  \"This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive  Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.\"       Then with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame,  Fearing my words offensive to his ear,  Till we had reach'd the river, I from speech  Abstain'd.  And lo!  toward us in a bark  Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,  Crying, \"Woe to you wicked spirits!  hope not  Ever to see the sky again.  I come  To take you to the other shore across,  Into eternal darkness, there to dwell  In fierce heat and in ice.  And thou, who there  Standest, live spirit!  get thee hence, and leave  These who are dead.\"  But soon as he beheld  I left them not, \"By other way,\" said he,  \"By other haven shalt thou come to shore,  Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat  Must carry.\"  Then to him thus spake my guide:  \"Charon!  thyself torment not: so 't is will'd,  Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.\"       Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks  Of him the boatman o'er the livid lake,  Around whose eyes glar'd wheeling flames.  Meanwhile  Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang'd,  And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words  They heard.  God and their parents they blasphem'd,  The human kind, the place, the time, and seed  That did engender them and give them birth.       Then all together sorely wailing drew  To the curs'd strand, that every man must pass  Who fears not God.  Charon, demoniac form,  With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,  Beck'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar  Strikes.  As fall off the light autumnal leaves,  One still another following, till the bough  Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;  E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood  Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,  Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.       Thus go they over through the umber'd wave,  And ever they on the opposing bank  Be landed, on this side another throng  Still gathers.  \"Son,\" thus spake the courteous guide,  \"Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,  All here together come from every clime,  And to o'erpass the river are not loth:  For so heaven's justice goads them on, that fear  Is turn'd into desire.  Hence ne'er hath past  Good spirit.  If of thee Charon complain,  Now mayst thou know the import of his words.\"       This said, the gloomy region trembling shook  So terribly, that yet with clammy dews  Fear chills my brow.  The sad earth gave a blast,  That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,  Which all my senses conquer'd quite, and I  Down dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seiz'd.        CANTO IV    BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash  Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,  As one by main force rous'd.  Risen upright,  My rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd  With fixed ken to know what place it was,  Wherein I stood.  For certain on the brink  I found me of the lamentable vale,  The dread abyss, that joins a thund'rous sound  Of plaints innumerable.  Dark and deep,  And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain  Explor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern.       \"Now let us to the blind world there beneath  Descend;\" the bard began all pale of look:  \"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.\"       Then I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:  \"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,  Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?\"       He then:  \"The anguish of that race below  With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear  Mistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way  Urges to haste.\"  Onward, this said, he mov'd;  And ent'ring led me with him on the bounds  Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.  Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard  Except of sighs, that made th' eternal air  Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief  Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,  Of men, women, and infants.  Then to me  The gentle guide:  \"Inquir'st thou not what spirits  Are these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass  Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin  Were blameless; and if aught they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#2)"],[1,"it made him whine softly when the girl herself was actually  with him. He was not lonely, nights, when he should have been out  howling at the stars. He was not lonely, because one night he prowled  about until he found a certain door, and when the girl opened that door  in the morning she found him curled up tight against it. She had reached  down and hugged him, the thick smother of her long hair falling all over  him in a delightful perfume; thereafter she placed a rug before the door  for him to sleep on. All through the long nights he knew that she was  just beyond the door, and he was content. Each day he thought less and  less of the wild places, and more of her.    Then there came the beginning of the change. There was a strange hurry  and excitement around him, and the girl paid less attention to him. He  grew uneasy. He sniffed the change in the air, and he began to study his  master's face. Then there came the morning, very early, when the babiche  collar and the iron chain were fastened to him again. Not until he had  followed his master out through the door and into the street did he  begin to understand. They were sending him away! He sat suddenly back on  his haunches and refused to budge.    \"Come, Kazan,\" coaxed the man. \"Come on, boy.\"    He hung back and showed his white fangs. He expected the lash of a whip  or the blow of a club, but neither came. His master laughed and took him  back to the house. When they left it again, the girl was with them and  walked with her hand touching his head. It was she who persuaded him to  leap up through a big dark hole into the still darker interior of a car,  and it was she who lured him to the darkest corner of all, where his  master fastened his chain. Then they went out, laughing like two  children. For hours after that, Kazan lay still and tense, listening to  the queer rumble of wheels under him. Several times those wheels  stopped, and he heard voices outside. At last he was sure that he heard  a familiar voice, and he strained at his chain and whined. The closed  door slid back. A man with a lantern climbed in, followed by his master.  He paid no attention to them, but glared out through the opening into  the gloom of night. He almost broke loose when he leaped down upon the  white snow, but when he saw no one there, he stood rigid, sniffing the  air. Over him were the stars he had howled at all his life, and about  him were the forests, black and silent, shutting them in like a wall.  Vainly he sought for that one scent that was missing, and Thorpe heard  the low note of grief in his shaggy throat. He took the lantern and held  it above his head, at the same time loosening his hold on the leash. At  that signal there came a voice from out of the night. It came from  behind them, and Kazan whirled so suddenly that the loosely held chain  slipped from the man's hand. He saw the glow of other lanterns. And  then, once more, the voice--    \"Kaa-aa-zan!\"    He was off like a bolt. Thorpe laughed to himself as he followed.    \"The old pirate!\" he chuckled.    When he came to the lantern-lighted space back of the caboose, Thorpe  found Kazan crouching down at a woman's feet. It was Thorpe's wife. She  smiled triumphantly at him as he came up out of the gloom.    \"You've won!\" he laughed, not unhappily. \"I'd have wagered my last  dollar he wouldn't do that for any voice on earth. You've won! Kazan,  you brute, I've lost you!\"    His face suddenly sobered as Isobel stooped to pick up the end of the  chain.    \"He's yours, Issy,\" he added quickly, \"but you must let me care for him  until--we _know_. Give me the chain. I won't trust him even now. He's a  wolf. I've seen him take an Indian's hand off at a single snap. I've  seen him tear out another dog's jugular in one leap. He's an outlaw--a  bad dog--in spite of the fact that he hung to me like a hero and brought  me out alive. I can't trust him. Give me the chain--\"    He did not finish. With the snarl of a wild beast Kazan had leaped to  his feet. His lips drew up and bared his long fangs. His spine  stiffened, and with a sudden cry of warning, Thorpe dropped a hand to  the revolver at his belt.    Kazan paid no attention to him. Another form had approached out of the  night, and stood now in the circle of illumination made by the lanterns.  It was McCready, who was to accompany Thorpe and his young wife back to  the Red River camp, where Thorpe was in charge of the building of the  new Trans-continental. The man was straight, powerfully built and clean  shaven. His jaw was so square that it was brutal, and there was a glow  in his eyes that was almost like the passion in Kazan's as he looked at  Isobel.    Her red and white stocking-cap had slipped free of her head and was  hanging over her shoulder. The dull blaze of the lanterns shone in the  warm glow of her hair. Her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes, suddenly  turned to him, were as blue as the bluest _bakneesh_ flower and glowed  like diamonds. McCready shifted his gaze, and instantly her hand fell on  Kazan's head. For the first time the dog did not seem to feel her touch.  He still snarled at McCready, the rumbling menace in his throat growing  deeper. Thorpe's wife tugged at the chain.    \"Down, Kazan--down!\" she commanded.    At the sound of her voice he relaxed.    \"Down!\" she repeated, and her free hand fell on his head again. He slunk  to her feet. But his lips were still drawn back. Thorpe was watching  him. He wondered at the deadly venom that shot from the wolfish eyes,  and looked at McCready. The big guide had uncoiled his long dog-whip. A  strange look had come into his face. He was staring hard at Kazan.  Suddenly he leaned forward, with both hands on his knees, and for a  tense moment or two he seemed to forget that Isobel Thorpe's wonderful  blue eyes were looking at him.    \"Hoo-koosh, Pedro--_charge_!\"    That one word--_charge_--was taught only to the dogs in the service of  the Northwest Mounted Police. Kazan did not move. McCready straightened,  and quick as a shot sent the long lash of his whip curling out into the  night with a crack like a pistol report.    \"Charge, Pedro--_charge_!\"    The rumble in Kazan's throat deepened to a snarling growl, but not a  muscle of his body moved. McCready turned to Thorpe.    \"I could have sworn that I knew that dog,\" he said. \"If it's Pedro, he's  _bad_!\"    Thorpe was taking the chain. Only the girl saw the look that came for an  instant into McCready's face. It made her shiver. A few minutes before,  when the train had first stopped at Les Pas, she had offered her hand  to this man and she had seen the same thing then. But even as she  shuddered she recalled the many things her husband had told her of the  forest people. She had grown to love them, to admire their big rough  manhood and loyal hearts, before he had brought her among them; and  suddenly she smiled at McCready, struggling to overcome that thrill of  fear and dislike.    \"He doesn't like you,\" she laughed at him softly. \"Won't you make  friends with him?\"    She drew Kazan toward him, with Thorpe holding the end of the chain.  McCready came to her side as she bent over the dog. His back was to  Thorpe as he hunched down. Isobel's bowed head was within a foot of his  face. He could see the glow in her cheek and the pouting curve of her  mouth as she quieted the low rumbling in Kazan's throat. Thorpe stood  ready to pull back on the chain, but for a moment McCready was between  him and his wife, and he could not see McCready's face. The man's eyes  were not on Kazan. He was staring at the girl.    \"You're brave,\" he said. \"I don't dare do that. He would take off my  hand!\"    He took the lantern from Thorpe and led the way to a narrow snow-path  branching off, from the track. Hidden back in the thick spruce was the  camp that Thorpe had left a fortnight before. There were two tents there  now in place of the one that he and his guide had used. A big fire was  burning in front of them. Close to the fire was a long sledge, and  fastened to trees just within the outer circle of firelight Kazan saw  the shadowy forms and gleaming eyes of his team-mates. He stood stiff  and motionless while Thorpe fastened him to a sledge. Once more he was  back in his forests--and in command. His mistress was laughing and  clapping her hands delightedly in the excitement of the strange and  wonderful life of which she had now become a part. Thorpe had thrown  back the flap of their tent, and she was entering ahead of him. She did  not look back. She spoke no word to him. He whined, and turned his red  eyes on McCready.    In the tent Thorpe was saying:    \"I'm sorry old Jackpine wouldn't go back with us, Issy. He drove me  down, but for love or money I couldn't get him to return. He's a Mission  Indian, and I'd give a month's salary to have you see him handle the  dogs. I'm not sure about this man McCready. He's a queer chap, the  Company's agent here tells me, and knows the woods like a book. But dogs  don't like a stranger. Kazan isn't going to take to him worth a cent!\"    Kazan heard the girl's voice, and stood rigid and motionless listening  to it. He did not hear or see McCready when he came up stealthily behind  him. The man's voice came as suddenly as a shot at his heels.    \"_Pedro_!\"    In an instant Kazan cringed as if touched by a lash.    \"Got you that time--didn't I, you old devil!\" whispered McCready, his  face strangely pale in the firelight. \"Changed your name, eh? But I  _got_ you--didn't I?\"          CHAPTER III    McCREADY PAYS THE DEBT      For a long time after he had uttered those words McCready sat in silence  beside the fire. Only for a moment or two at a time did his eyes leave  Kazan. After a little, when he was sure that Thorpe and Isobel had  retired for the night, he went into his own tent and returned with a  flask of whisky. During the next half-hour he drank frequently. Then he  went over and sat on"]]]
