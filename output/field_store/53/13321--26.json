Presently she spoke again: \"I shall always want to know about you--what  is happening to you. How could it be otherwise?\"    She was half realising one of the deepest things in existence, that the  closest bond between two human beings is a bond of secrecy upon a thing  which vitally, fatally concerns both or either. It is a power at once  malevolent and beautiful. A secret like that of David and Hylda will  do in a day what a score of years could not accomplish, will insinuate  confidences which might never be given to the nearest or dearest. In  neither was any feeling of the heart begotten by their experiences; and  yet they had gone deeper in each other's lives than any one either  had known in a lifetime. They had struck a deeper note than love or  friendship. They had touched the chord of a secret and mutual experience  which had gone so far that their lives would be influenced by it for  ever after. Each understood this in a different way.    Hylda looked towards the letter lying on the table. It had raised in  her mind, not a doubt, but an undefined, undefinable anxiety. He saw the  glance, and said: \"I was writing to one who has been as a sister to me.  She was my mother's sister though she is almost as young as I. Her name  is Faith. There is nothing there of what concerns thee and me, though  it would make no difference if she knew.\" Suddenly a thought seemed to  strike him. \"The secret is of thee and me. There is safety. If it became  another's, there might be peril. The thing shall be between us only, for  ever?\"    \"Do you think that I--\"    \"My instinct tells me a woman of sensitive mind might one day, out of an  unmerciful honesty, tell her husband--\"    \"I am not married-\"    \"But one day--\"    She interrupted him. \"Sentimental egotism will not rule me. Tell me,\"  she added, \"tell me one thing before I go. You said that your course was  set. What is it?\"    \"I remain here,\" he answered quietly. \"I remain in the service of Prince  Kaid.\"    \"It is a dreadful government, an awful service--\"    \"That is why I stay.\"    \"You are going to try and change things here--you alone?\"    \"I hope not alone, in time.\"    \"You are going to leave England, your friends, your family, your  place--in Hamley, was it not? My aunt has read of you--my cousin--\" she  paused.    \"I had no place in Hamley. Here is my place. Distance has little to do  with understanding or affection. I had an uncle here in the East for  twenty-five years, yet I knew him better than all others in the world.  Space is nothing if minds are in sympathy. My uncle talked to me over  seas and lands. I felt him, heard him speak.\"    \"You think that minds can speak to minds, no matter what the  distance--real and definite things?\"    \"If I were parted from one very dear to me, I would try to say to him  or her what was in my mind, not by written word only, but by the flying  thought.\"    She sat down suddenly, as though overwhelmed. \"Oh, if that were  possible!\" she said. \"If only one could send a thought like that!\" Then  with an impulse, and the flicker of a sad smile, she reached out a hand.  \"If ever in the years to come you want to speak to me, will you try to  make me understand, as your uncle did with you?\"    \"I cannot tell,\" he answered. \"That which is deepest within us obeys  only the laws of its need. By instinct it turns to where help lies, as  a wild deer, fleeing, from captivity, makes for the veldt and the  watercourse.\"    She got to her feet again. \"I want to pay my debt,\" she said solemnly.  \"It is a debt that one day must be paid--so awful--so awful!\" A swift  change passed over her. She shuddered, and grew white. \"I said brave  words just now,\" she added in a hoarse whisper, \"but now I see him lying  there cold and still, and you stooping over him. I see you touch his  breast, his pulse. I see you close his eyes. One instant full of the  pulse of life, the next struck out into infinite space. Oh, I shall  never--how can I ever-forget!\" She turned her head away from him, then  composed herself again, and said quietly, with anxious eyes: \"Why was  nothing said or done? Perhaps they are only waiting. Perhaps they know.  Why was it announced that he died in his bed at home?\"    \"I cannot tell. When a man in high places dies in Egypt, it may be one  death or another. No one inquires too closely. He died in Kaid Pasha's  Palace, where other men have died, and none has inquired too closely.  To-day they told me at the Palace that his carriage was seen to leave  with himself and Mizraim the Chief Eunuch. Whatever the object, he was  secretly taken to his house from the Palace, and his brother Nahoum  seized upon his estate in the early morning.    \"I think that no one knows the truth. But it is all in the hands of  God. We can do nothing more. Thee must go. Thee should not have come.  In England thee will forget, as thee should forget. In Egypt I shall  remember, as I should remember.\"    \"Thee,\" she repeated softly. \"I love the Quaker thee. My grandmother was  an American Quaker. She always spoke like that. Will you not use thee  and thou in speaking to me, always?\"    \"We are not likely to speak together in any language in the future,\" he  answered. \"But now thee must go, and I will--\"    \"My cousin, Mr. Lacey, is waiting for me in the garden,\" she answered.  \"I shall be safe with him.\" She moved towards the door. He caught the  handle to turn it, when there came the noise of loud talking, and the  sound of footsteps in the court-yard. He opened the door slightly and  looked out, then closed it quickly. \"It is Nahoum Pasha,\" he said.  \"Please, the other room,\" he added, and pointed to a curtain. \"There is  a window leading on a garden. The garden-gate opens on a street leading  to the Ezbekiah Square and your hotel.\"    \"But, no, I shall stay here,\" she said. She drew down her veil, then  taking from her pocket another, arranged it also, so that her face was  hidden.    \"Thee must go,\" he said--\"go quickly.\" Again he pointed.    \"I will remain,\" she rejoined, with determination, and seated herself in  a chair.          CHAPTER X. THE FOUR WHO KNEW    There was a knocking at the door. David opened it. Nahoum Pasha stepped  inside, and stood still a moment looking at Hylda. Then he made low  salutation to her, touched his hand to his lips and breast saluting  David, and waited.    \"What is thy business, pasha?\" asked David quietly, and motioned towards  a chair.    \"May thy path be on the high hills, Saadat-el-basha. I come for a favour  at thy hands.\" Nahoum sat down. \"What favour is mine to give to Nahoum  Pasha?\"    \"The Prince has given thee supreme place--it was mine but yesterday. It  is well. To the deserving be the fruits of deserving.\"    \"Is merit, then, so truly rewarded here?\" asked David quietly.    \"The Prince saw merit at last when he chose your Excellency for  councillor.\"    \"How shall I show merit, then, in the eyes of Nahoum Pasha?\"    \"Even by urging the Prince to give me place under him again. Not as  heretofore--that is thy place--yet where it may be. I have capacity. I  can aid thee in the great task. Thou wouldst remake our Egypt--and my  heart is with you. I would rescue, not destroy. In years gone by I  tried to do good to this land, and I failed. I was alone. I had not the  strength to fight the forces around me. I was overcome. I had too little  faith. But my heart was with the right--I am an Armenian and a Christian  of the ancient faith. I am in sorrow. Death has humbled me. My brother  Foorgat Bey--may flowers bloom for ever on his grave!--he is dead,\"--his  eyes were fixed on those of David, as with a perfectly assured  candour--\"and my heart is like an empty house. But man must not be idle  and live--if Kaid lets me live. I have riches. Are not Foorgat's riches  mine, his Palace, his gardens, his cattle, and his plantations, are they  not mine? I may sit in the court-yard and hear the singers, may listen  to the tale-tellers by the light of the moon; I may hear the tales of  Al-Raschid chanted by one whose tongue never falters, and whose voice  is like music; after the manner of the East I may give bread and meat  to the poor at sunset; I may call the dancers to the feast. But what  comfort shall it give? I am no longer a youth. I would work. I would  labour for the land of Egypt, for by work shall we fulfil ourselves,  redeem ourselves. Saadat, I would labour, but my master has taken away  from me the anvil, the fire, and the hammer, and I sit without the door  like an armless beggar. What work to do in Egypt save to help the land,  and how shall one help, save in the Prince's service? There can be no  reform from outside. If I laboured for better things outside Kaid's  Palace, how long dost thou think I should escape the Nile, or the  diamond-dust in my coffee? The work which I did, is it not so that it,  with much more, falls now to thy hands, Saadat, with a confidence from  Kaid that never was mine?\"    \"I sought not the office.\"    \"Have I a word of blame? I come to ask for work to do with thee. Do I  not know Prince Kaid? He had come to distrust us all. As stale water  were we in his taste. He had no pleasure in us, and in our deeds he  found only stones of stumbling. He knew not whom to trust. One by one we  all had yielded to ceaseless intrigue and common distrust of each other,  until no honest man was left; till all were intent to save their lives  by holding power; for in this land to lose power is to lose life. No man  who has been in high place, has had the secrets of the Palace and the  ear of the Prince, lives after he has lost favour. The Prince, for his  safety, must ensure silence, and the only silence in Egypt is the grave.  In thee, Saadat, Kaid has found an honest man. Men will call thee mad,  if thou remainest honest, but that is within thine own bosom and with  fate. For me, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#19)"],[1,"p. If there is a wish for immortality, and  no evidence, why not say just that? If there are conflicting evidences,  why not state them? If there is not ground for a candid thinker to  make up his mind, yea or nay,--why not suspend the judgment? I weary  of these dogmatizers. I tire of these hacks of routine, who deny the  dogmas. I neither affirm nor deny. I stand here to try the case. I am  here to consider,--to consider how it is. I will try to keep the balance  true. Of what use to take the chair, and glibly rattle off theories  of societies, religion, and nature, when I know that practical  objections lie in the way, insurmountable by me and by my mates? Why  so talkative in public, when each of my neighbors can pin me to my  seat by arguments I cannot refute? Why pretend that life is so simple  a game, when we know how subtle and elusive the Proteus is? Why think  to shut up all things in your narrow coop, when we know there are not  one or two only, but ten, twenty, a thousand things, and unlike? Why  fancy that you have all the truth in your keeping? There is much to  say on all sides.    Who shall forbid a wise skepticism, seeing that there is no practical  question on which anything more than an approximate solution can be  had? Is not marriage an open question when it is alleged, from the  beginning of the world, that such as are in the institution wish to  get out, and such as are out wish to get in? And the reply of Socrates,  to him who asked whether he should choose a wife, still remains  reasonable, \"that, whether he should choose one or not, he would repent  it.\" Is not the state a question? All society is divided in opinion  on the subject of the state. Nobody loves it; great numbers dislike  it, and suffer conscientious scruples to allegiance: and the only  defense set up, is, the fear of doing worse in disorganizing. Is it  otherwise with the church? Or, to put any of the questions which touch  mankind nearest,--shall the young man aim at a leading part in law,  in politics, in trade? It will not be pretended that a success in  either of these kinds is quite coincident with what is best and inmost  in his mind. Shall he, then, cutting the stays that hold him fast to  the social state, put out to sea with no guidance but his genius? There  is much to say on both sides. Remember the open question between the  present order of \"competition,\" and the friends of \"attractive and  associated labor.\" The generous minds embrace the proposition of labor  shared by all; it is the only honesty; nothing else is safe. It is  from the poor man's hut alone, that strength and virtue come; and yet,  on the other side, it is alleged that labor impairs the form, and  breaks the spirit of man, and the laborers cry unanimously, \"We have  no thoughts.\" Culture, how indispensable! I cannot forgive you the  want of accomplishment; and yet, culture will instantly destroy that  chiefest beauty of spontaneousness. Excellent is culture for a savage;  but once let him read in the book, and he is no longer able not to  think of Plutarch's heroes. In short, since true fortitude of  understanding consists \"in not letting what we know be embarrassed by  what we do not know,\" we ought to secure those advantages which we can  command, and not risk them by clutching after the airy and unattainable.  Come, no chimeras! Let us go abroad; let us mix in affairs; let us  learn, and get, and have, and climb. \"Men are a sort of moving plants,  and, like trees, receive a great part of their nourishment from the  air. If they keep too much at home, they pine.\" Let us have a robust,  manly life; let us know what we know, for certain; what we have, let  it be solid, and seasonable, and our own. A world in the hand is worth  two in the bush. Let us have to do with real men and women, and not  with skipping ghosts.    This, then, is the right ground of the skeptic,--this of consideration,  of self-containing; not at all of unbelief; not at all of universal  denying, nor of universal doubting,--doubting even that he doubts;  least of all, of scoffing and profligate jeering at all that is stable  and good. These are no more his moods than are those of religion and  philosophy. He is the considerer, the prudent, taking in sail, counting  stock, husbanding his means, believing that a man has too many enemies,  than that he can afford to be his own; that we cannot give ourselves  too many advantages, in this unequal conflict, with powers so vast and  unweariable ranged on one side, and this little, conceited, vulnerable  popinjay that a man is, bobbing up and down into every danger, on the  other. It is a position taken up for better defense, as of more safety,  and one that can be maintained; and it is one of more opportunity and  range; as, when we build a house, the rule is, to set it not too high  nor too low, under the wind, but out of the dirt.    The philosophy we want is one of fluxions and mobility. The Spartan  and Stoic schemes are too stark and stiff for our occasion. A theory  of Saint John, and of non-resistance, seems, on the other hand, too  thin and aerial. We want some coat woven of elastic steel, stout as  the first, and limber as the second. We want a ship in these billows  we inhabit. An angular, dogmatic house would be rent to chips and  splinters, in this storm of many elements. No, it must be tight, and  fit to the form of man, to live at all; as a shell is the architecture  of a house founded on the sea. The soul of man must be the type of our  scheme, just as the body of man is the type after which a dwelling-house  is built. Adaptiveness is the peculiarity of human nature. We are  golden averages, volitant stabilities, compensated or periodic errors,  houses founded on the sea. The wise skeptic wishes to have a near view  of the best game, and the chief players; what is best in the planet;  art and nature, places and events, but mainly men. Everything that is  excellent in mankind,--a form of grace, an arm of iron, lips of  persuasion, a brain of resources, every one skilful to play and win,--he  will see and judge.    The terms of admission to this spectacle are, that he have a certain  solid and intelligible way of living of his own; some method of  answering the inevitable needs of human life; proof that he has played  with skill and success; that he has evinced the temper, stoutness, and  the range of qualities which, among his contemporaries and countrymen,  entitle him to fellowship and trust. For, the secrets of life are not  shown except to sympathy and likeness. Men do not confide themselves  to boys, or coxcombs, or pedants, but to their peers. Some wise  limitation, as the modern phrase is; some condition between the  extremes, and having itself a positive quality; some stark and  sufficient man, who is not salt or sugar, but sufficiently related to  the world to do justice to Paris or London, and, at the same time, a  vigorous and original thinker, whom cities cannot overawe, but who  uses them,--is the fit person to occupy this ground of speculation.    These qualities meet in the character of Montaigne. And yet, since the  personal regard which I entertain for Montaigne may be unduly great,  I will, under the shield of this prince of egotists, offer, as an  apology for electing him as the representative of skepticism, a word  or two to explain how my love began and grew for this admirable gossip.    A single odd volume of Cotton's translation of the Essays remained to  me from my father's library, when a boy. It lay long neglected, until,  after many years, when I was newly escaped from college, I read the  book, and procured the remaining volumes. I remember the delight and  wonder in which I lived with it. It seemed to me as if I had myself  written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my  thought and experience. It happened, when in Paris, in 1833, that, in  the cemetery of Pere le Chaise, I came to a tomb of Augustus Collignon,  who died in 1830, aged sixty-eight years, and who, said the monument,  \"lived to do right, and had formed himself to virtue on the Essays of  Montaigne.\" Some years later, I became acquainted with an accomplished  English poet, John Sterling; and, in prosecuting my correspondence,  I found that, from a love of Montaigne, he had made a pilgrimage to  his chateau, still standing near Castellan, in Perigord, and, after  two hundred and fifty years, had copied from the walls of his library  the inscriptions which Montaigne had written there. That Journal of  Mr. Sterling's, published in the Westminster Review, Mr. Hazlitt has  reprinted in the Prolegomenae to his edition of the Essays. I heard  with pleasure that one of the newly-discovered autographs of William  Shakspeare was in a copy of Florio's translation of Montaigne. It is  the only book which we certainly know to have been in the poet's  library. And, oddly enough, the duplicate copy of Florio, which the  British Museum purchased, with a view of protecting the Shakspeare  autograph (as I was informed in the Museum), turned out to have the  autograph of Ben Jonson in the fly-leaf. Leigh Hunt relates of Lord  Byron, that Montaigne was the only great writer of past times whom he  read with avowed satisfaction. Other coincidences, not needful to be  mentioned here, concurred to make this old Gascon still new and immortal  for me.    In 1571, on the death of his father, Montaigne, then thirty-eight years  old, retired from the practice of law, at Bordeaux, and settled himself  on his estate. Though he had been a man of pleasure, and sometimes a  courtier, his studious habits now grew on him, and he loved the compass,  staidness, and independence of the country gentleman's life. He took  up his economy in good earnest, and made his farms yield the most.  Downright and plain-dealing, and abhorring to be deceived or to  deceive, he was esteemed in the country for his sense and probity. In  the civil wars of"]]]
