And if thou dost wish to know their errand, I will not hide it  from time. A certain king, vehemently longing to drive this man far from  his fatherland and possessions, because in might he outshone all the  sons of Aeolus, sends him to voyage hither on a bootless venture; and  asserts that the stock of Aeolus will not escape the heart-grieving  wrath and rage of implacable Zeus, nor the unbearable curse and  vengeance due for Phrixus, until the fleece comes back to Hellas. And  their ship was fashioned by Pallas Athena, not such a one as are the  ships among the Colchians, on the vilest of which we chanced. For the  fierce waves and wind broke her utterly to pieces; but the other holds  firm with her bolts, even though all the blasts should buffet her. And  with equal swiftness she speedeth before the wind and when the crew ply  the oar with unresting hands. And he hath gathered in her the mightiest  heroes of all Achaea, and hath come to thy city from wandering far  through cities and gulfs of the dread ocean, in the hope that thou wilt  grant him the fleece. But as thou dost please, so shall it be, for he  cometh not to use force, but is eager to pay thee a recompense for the  gift. He has heard from me of thy bitter foes the Sauromatae, and he  will subdue them to thy sway. And if thou desirest to know their names  and lineage I will tell thee all. This man on whose account the rest  were gathered from Hellas, they call Jason, son of Aeson, whom Cretheus  begat. And if in truth he is of the stock of Cretheus himself, thus he  would be our kinsman on the father's side. For Cretheus and Athamas were  both sons of Aeolus; and Phrixus was the son of Athamas, son of Aeolus.  And here, if thou hast heard at all of the seed of Helios, thou dost  behold Augeias; and this is Telamon sprung from famous Aeacus; and Zeus  himself begat Aeacus. And so all the rest, all the comrades that follow  him, are the sons or grandsons of the immortals.\"    (ll. 367-371) Such was the tale of Argus; but the king at his words was  filled with rage as he heard; and his heart was lifted high in wrath.  And he spake in heavy displeasure; and was angered most of all with the  son of Chalciope; for he deemed that on their account the strangers had  come; and in his fury his eyes flashed forth beneath his brows:    (ll. 372-381) \"Begone from my sight, felons, straightway, ye and your  tricks, from the land, ere someone see a fleece and a Phrixus to his  sorrow. Banded together with your friends from Hellas, not for the  fleece, but to seize my sceptre and royal power have ye come hither.  Had ye not first tasted of my table, surely would I have cut out your  tongues and hewn off both hands and sent you forth with your feet alone,  so that ye might be stayed from starting hereafter. And what lies have  ye uttered against the blessed gods!\"    (ll. 382-385) Thus he spake in his wrath; and mightily from its depths  swelled the heart of Aeacus' son, and his soul within longed to speak  a deadly word in defiance, but Aeson's son checked him, for he himself  first made gentle answer:    (ll. 386-395) \"Aeetes, bear with this armed band, I pray. For not in the  way thou deemest have we come to thy city and palace, no, nor yet with  such desires. For who would of his own will dare to cross so wide a  sea for the goods of a stranger? But fate and the ruthless command of a  presumptuous king urged me. Grant a favour to thy suppliants, and to all  Hellas will I publish a glorious fame of thee; yea, we are ready now to  pay thee a swift recompense in war, whether it be the Sauromatae or some  other people that thou art eager to subdue to thy sway.\"    (ll. 396-400) He spake, flattering him with gentle utterance; but the  king's soul brooded a twofold purpose within him, whether he should  attack and slay them on the spot or should make trial of their might.  And this, as he pondered, seemed the better way, and he addressed Jason  in answer:    (ll. 401-421) \"Stranger, why needest thou go through thy tale to the  end? For if ye are in truth of heavenly race, or have come in no wise  inferior to me, to win the goods of strangers, I will give thee the  fleece to bear away, if thou dost wish, when I have tried thee. For  against brave men I bear no grudge, such as ye yourselves tell me of him  who bears sway in Hellas. And the trial of your courage and might shall  be a contest which I myself can compass with my hands, deadly though it  be. Two bulls with feet of bronze I have that pasture on the plain of  Ares, breathing forth flame from their jaws; them do I yoke and drive  over the stubborn field of Ares, four plough-gates; and quickly cleaving  it with the share up to the headland, I cast into the furrows the seed,  not the corn of Demeter, but the teeth of a dread serpent that grow up  into the fashion of armed men; them I slay at once, cutting them down  beneath my spear as they rise against me on all sides. In the morning do  I yoke the oxen, and at eventide I cease from the harvesting. And thou,  if thou wilt accomplish such deeds as these, on that very day shalt  carry off the fleece to the king's palace; ere that time comes I will  not give it, expect it not. For indeed it is unseemly that a brave man  should yield to a coward.\"    (ll. 422-426) Thus he spake; and Jason, fixing his eyes on the ground,  sat just as he was, speechless, helpless in his evil plight. For a long  time he turned the matter this way and that, and could in no way take on  him the task with courage, for a mighty task it seemed; and at last he  made reply with crafty words:    (ll. 427-431) \"With thy plea of right, Aeetes, thou dost shut me in  overmuch. Wherefore also I will dare that contest, monstrous as it is,  though it be my doom to die. For nothing will fall upon men more dread  than dire necessity, which indeed constrained me to come hither at a  king's command.\"    (ll. 432-438) Thus he spake, smitten by his helpless plight; and the  king with grim words addressed him, sore troubled as he was: \"Go forth  now to the gathering, since thou art eager for the toil; but if thou  shouldst fear to lift the yoke upon the oxen or shrink from the deadly  harvesting, then all this shall be my care, so that another too may  shudder to come to a man that is better than he.\"    (ll. 439-463) He spake outright; and Jason rose from his seat, and  Augeias and Telamon at once; and Argus followed alone, for he signed to  his brothers to stay there on the spot meantime; and so they went forth  from the hall. And wonderfully among them all shone the son of Aeson  for beauty and grace; and the maiden looked at him with stealthy glance,  holding her bright veil aside, her heart smouldering with pain; and  her soul creeping like a dream flitted in his track as he went. So they  passed forth from the palace sorely troubled. And Chalciope, shielding  herself from the wrath of Aeetes, had gone quickly to her chamber with  her sons. And Medea likewise followed, and much she brooded in her soul  all the cares that the Loves awaken. And before her eyes the vision  still appeared--himself what like he was, with what vesture he was clad,  what things he spake, how he sat on his seat, how he moved forth to the  door--and as she pondered she deemed there never was such another man;  and ever in her ears rung his voice and the honey-sweet words which he  uttered. And she feared for him, lest the oxen or Aeetes with his  own hand should slay him; and she mourned him as though already slain  outright, and in her affliction a round tear through very grievous  pity coursed down her cheek; and gently weeping she lifted up her voice  aloud:    (ll. 464-470) \"Why does this grief come upon me, poor wretch? Whether he  be the best of heroes now about to perish, or the worst, let him go to  his doom. Yet I would that he had escaped unharmed; yea, may this be so,  revered goddess, daughter of Perses, may he avoid death and return home;  but if it be his lot to be o'ermastered by the oxen, may he first learn  this, that I at least do not rejoice in his cruel calamity.\"    (ll. 471-474) Thus then was the maiden's heart racked by love-cares. But  when the others had gone forth from the people and the city, along the  path by which at the first they had come from the plain, then Argus  addressed Jason with these words:    (ll. 475-483) \"Son of Aeson, thou wilt despise the counsel which I will  tell thee, but, though in evil plight, it is not fitting to forbear from  the trial. Ere now thou hast heard me tell of a maiden that uses sorcery  under the guidance of Hecate, Perses' daughter. If we could win her  aid there will be no dread, methinks, of thy defeat in the contest;  but terribly do I fear that my mother will not take this task upon  her. Nevertheless I will go back again to entreat her, for a common  destruction overhangs us all.\"    (ll. 383-491) He spake with goodwill, and Jason answered with these  words: \"Good friend, if this is good in thy sight, I say not nay. Go and  move thy mother, beseeching her aid with prudent words; pitiful indeed  is our hope when we have put our return in the keeping of women.\" So  he spake, and quickly they reached the back-water. And their comrades  joyfully questioned them, when they saw them close at hand; and to them  spoke Aeson's son grieved at heart:    (ll. 492-501) \"My friends, the heart of ruthless Aeetes is utterly  filled with wrath against us, for not at all can the goal be reached  either by me or by you who question me. He said that two bulls with feet  of bronze pasture on the plain of Ares, breathing forth flame from their  jaws. And with these he bade me plough the field, four plough-gates; and  said that he would give me from a serpent's jaws"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#19)"],[1,"they  were beating him so cruelly that already they had cut the skin on his  back to the bone. Down his sides and flanks the blood ran, so that the  nag was all covered with blood down to the belly. [132] Erec came along  alone after them. He was very sad and distressed about the knight whom  he saw them treat so spitefully. Between two woods in an open field he  came up with them, and asks: \"My lords,\" says he, \"for what crime do you  treat this man so ill and lead him along like a common thief? You are  treating him too cruelly. You are driving him just as if he had been  caught stealing. It is a monstrous insult to strip a knight naked, and  then bind him and beat him so shamefully. Hand him over to me, I beg of  you with all good-will and courtesy. I have no wish to demand him of you  forcibly.\" \"Vassal,\" they say, \"what business is this of yours? You must  be mad to make any demand of us. If you do not like it, try and improve  matters.\" Erec replies: \"Indeed, I like it not, and you shall not lead  him away so easily. Since you have left the matter in my hands, I say  whoever can get possession of him let him keep him. Take your positions.  I challenge you. You shall not take him any farther before some blows  have been dealt.\" \"Vassal,\" they reply, \"you are mad, indeed, to wish  to measure your strength with us. If you were four instead of one,  you would have no more strength against us than one lamb against two  wolves.\" \"I do not know how it will turn out,\" Erec replies; \"if the sky  fails and the earth melts, then many a lark will be caught. Many a man  boasts loudly who is of little worth. On guard now, for I am going  to attack you.\" The giants were strong and fierce, and held in their  clenched hands their big clubs tipped with iron. Erec went at them lance  in rest. He fears neither of them, in spite of their menace and their  pride, and strikes the foremost of them through the eye so deep into the  brain that the blood and brains spurt out at the back of his neck; that  one lies dead and his heart stops beating. When the other saw him dead,  he had reason to be sorely grieved. Furious, he went to avenge him: with  both hands he raised his club on high and thought to strike him squarely  upon his unprotected head: but Erec watched the blow, and received it on  his shield. Even so, the giant landed such a blow that it quite stunned  him, and almost made him fall to earth from his steed. Erec covers  himself with his shield and the giant, recovering himself, thinks to  strike again quickly upon his head. But Erec had drawn his sword, and  attacked him with such fierceness that the giant was severely handled:  he strikes him so hard upon the neck that he splits him down to the  saddle-bow. He scatters his bowels upon the earth, and the body falls  full length, split in two halves. The knight weeps with joy and,  worshipping, praises God who has sent him this aid. Then Erec unbound  him, made him dress and arm himself, and mount one of the horses; the  other he made him lead with his right hand, and asks him who he is. And  he replied: \"Noble knight, thou art my liege lord. I wish to regard  thee as my lord, as by right I ought to do, for thou hast saved my life,  which but now would have been cut off from my body with great torment  and cruelty. What chance, fair gentle sire, in God's name, guided thee  hither to me, to free me by thy courage from the hands of my enemies?  Sire, I wish to do thee homage. Henceforth, I shall always accompany  thee and serve thee as my lord.\" Erec sees that he is disposed to serve  him gladly, if he may, and says: \"Friend, for your service I have no  desire; but you must know that I came hither to succour you at the  instance of your lady, whom I found sorrowing in this wood. Because of  you, she grieves and moans; for full of sorrow is her heart. I wish to  present you to her now. As soon as I have reunited you with her, I shall  continue my way alone; for you have no call to go with me. I have no  need cf your company; but I fain would know your name.\" \"Sire,\" says he,  \"as you wish. Since you desire to know my name, it must not be kept from  you. My name is Cadoc of Tabriol: know that thus I am called. But since  I must part from you. I should like to know, if it may be, who you are  and of what land, where I may sometime find and search for you, when  I shall go a way from here.\" Erec replies: \"Friend, that I will never  confide to you. Never speak of it again; but if you wish to find it out  and do me honour in any wise go quickly now without delay to my lord,  King Arthur, who with might and main is hunting the stag in yonder wood,  as I take it, not five short leagues from here. Go thither quickly and  take him word that you are sent to him as a gift by him whom yesterday  within his tent he joyfully received and lodged. And be careful not to  conceal from him from what peril I set free both your life and body. I  am dearly cherished at the court, and if you present yourself in my name  you will do me a service and honour. There you shall ask who I am; but  you cannot know it otherwise.\" \"Sire,\" says Cadoc, \"I will follow your  bidding in all respects. You need never have any fear that I do not go  with a glad heart. I shall tell the King the full truth regarding  the battle which you have fought on my behalf.\" Thus speaking, they  continued their way until they came to the maiden where Erec had left  her. The damsel's joy knew no bounds when she saw coming her lover whom  she never thought to see again. Taking him by the hand, Erec presents  him to her with the words: \"Grieve no longer, demoiselle! Behold your  lover glad and joyous.\" And she with prudence makes reply: \"Sire, by  right you have won us both. Yours we should be, to serve and honour. But  who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?\" Erec makes answer: \"My  gentle lady, no recompense do I ask of you. To God I now commend you  both, for too long, methinks, I have tarried here.\" Then he turns his  horse about, and rides away as fast as he can. Cadoc of Tabriol with his  damsel rides off in another direction; and soon he told the news to King  Arthur and the Queen.    (Vv. 4580-4778.) Erec continues to ride at great speed to the place  where Enide was awaiting him in great concern, thinking that surely he  had completely deserted her. And he, too, was in great fear lest some  one, finding her alone, might have carried her off. So he made all haste  to return. But the heat of the day was such, and his arms caused him  such distress, that his wounds broke open and burst the bandages. His  wounds never stopped bleeding before he came directly to the spot where  Enide was waiting for him. She espied him and rejoiced: but she did not  realise or know the pain from which he was suffering; for all his body  was bathed in blood, and his heart hardly had strength to beat. As he  was descending a hill he fell suddenly over upon his horse's neck. As he  tried to straighten up, he lost his saddle and stirrups, falling, as if  lifeless, in a faint. Then began such heavy grief, when Enide saw him  fall to earth. Full of fear at the sight of him, she runs toward him  like one who makes no concealment of her grief. Aloud she cries, and  wrings her hands: not a shred of her robe remains untorn across her  breast. She begins to tear her hair and lacerate her tender face. [133]  \"Ah God!\" she cries, \"fair gentle Lord, why dost Thou let me thus live  on? Come Death, and kill me hastily!\" With these words she faints upon  his body. When she recovered, she said to herself reproachfully: \"Woe is  me, wretched Enide; I am the murderer of my lord, in having killed  him by my speech. My lord would still be now alive, if I in my mad  presumption had not spoken the word which engaged him in this adventure.  Silence never harmed any one, but speech often worketh woe. The truth of  this I have tried and proved in more ways than one.\" Beside her lord she  took her seat, holding his head upon her lap. Then she begins her dole  anew. \"Alas,\" she says, \"my lord, unhappy thou, thou who never hadst a  peer; for in thee was beauty seen and prowess was made manifest; wisdom  had given thee its heart, and largess set a crown upon thee, without  which no one is esteemed. But what did I say? A grievous mistake I made  in uttering the word which has killed my lord--that fatal poisoned word  for which I must justly be reproached; and I recognise and admit that  no one is guilty but myself; I alone must be blamed for this.\" Then  fainting she falls upon the ground, and when she later sat up again, she  only moans again the more: \"God, what shall I do, and why live on? Why  does Death delay and hesitate to come and seize me without respite?  Truly, Death holds me in great contempt! Since Death does not deign to  take my life, I must myself perforce achieve the vengeance for my sinful  deed. Thus shall I die in spite of Death, who will not heed my call for  aid. Yet, I cannot die through mere desire, nor would complaining avail  me aught. The sword, which my lord had gilded on, ought by right to  avenge his death. I will not longer consume myself in distress, in  prayer, and vain desire.\" She draws the sword forth from its sheath and  begins to consider it. God, who is full of mercy, caused her to delay  a little; and while she passes in review her sorrow and her misfortune,  behold there comes riding apace a Count with numerous suite, who from  afar had heard the lady's loud outcry. God did not wish to desert her;  for now she would have killed herself, had she not been surprised by  those who took away from her the sword and thrust it back into its  sheath. The Count then dismounted from his horse and began to inquire  of her concerning the knight, and whether she was his wife or his  lady-love. \"Both one and the other, sire,\" she says, \"my sorrow is such  as I cannot tell. Woe is me that I am not dead.\" And the Count begins  to"]]]
