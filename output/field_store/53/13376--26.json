Then, he rallied, exclaiming:    \"I will earn money enough to take me back to the United States on the  first ship that comes this way. Perhaps with a sample of my nitrate  I------\"    He suddenly felt a heavy hand laid on his shoulder, and turning he was  both astonished and pleased to find one of the seaman of the  _Elizabeth_ standing beside him!    \"Ahoy, shipmate!\" greeted the sailor, giving the true nautical pitch, \"so  I've follered you into port at last, though it's a sorry cruise I've had.\"    \"Captain Hillgrove!\" cried Jack, elated. \"Where is he?\"    \"Outside, shipmate. He durstn't stay inside longer, and he sent me to keep  a lookout for you. I was giving you up when I clapped my old watchdogs on  you. You are ready to go out to the _Elizabeth_ in my boat?\"    Jack's reply was an exclamation of joy and a more fervant grip of the  honest old tar's hand.    \"Captain Hillgrove had not deserted me after all!\"    Without further trouble or delay the couple made the trip to the waiting  vessel, when Jack was greeted by the bluff old skipper:    \"Bless my eyes! but I had given you up to old Davy Jones.\"    \"And I thought you had left me in the lurch,\" said Jack frankly, as he  cringed under the grip given his hand by the other.    \"I did not dare stay in Cobija longer, my hearty. If I had done so nary a  bit of your dust would have been left on the _Elizabeth_. Bless my  eyes! but I'm just overflowing and roaring glad--run up the yards lads.  Lively, lads! put the old _Elizabeth_ on her wings. We must be a long  way from here afore sun-up.\"    Exciting scenes followed, of which Jack was a spectator and not an actor.  For the present his work was done, and he had time now to ponder upon his  ups and downs, hardly able to believe that at last he was really on his  homeward journey. He felt far more confident in the care of bluff Captain  Hillgrove than in that of the fickle Peruvians.    Nor was his confidence misplaced, for the night passed without anything  occurring to interrupt their progress, and when the sun rose the following  morning it found them many leagues from land, and bowling merrily on their  way.    Captain Hillgrove listened to his account of the fate of poor Plum Plucky  with a feeling of sorrow, though he had never met the young American.    Jack's return home was something of a triumph, though he was saddened by  the loss of his companion during those trying scenes he could not put from  his mind, while his longings to reach home were tinged with those  forebodings one cannot escape who has been away so long, and the nearer he  approached his native land the more ominous became those feelings!    Were his parents still living and well? Was--was Jenny still true to him?  What had she thought of his long, weary years of absence? Until then he  had not realized that he had been away so long.    At last the old _Elizabeth_ was safely moored at her dock.    Though Captain Hillgrove was anxious to know what the result of their  speculation was going to be, he allowed Jack time to hunt up his relatives  and friends before the nitrate was moved from the ship's hold.    I cannot begin to explain the joyous reception accorded our hero at his  home, for many had given him up as dead.    With a tremulous tongue he asked for Jenny dreading, doubting, expecting  he knew not what; and then his cup of happiness overflowed at the  thrice-welcome news of her well-being and faithfulness to him, and that  she had just returned to her native town.    Jenny was not only living and well, but she had never given up looking for  him, believing he would some day return to her.    The sweet happiness of the meeting between the pair is too sacred to be  revealed.    When the first transport of his reception home had passed, Jack proceeded  to put on the market his ship-load of nitrate, to be met with another  rebuff in the checkered wheel of fortune.    He could find no one with faith in the virtue of his product brought from  the wilds of South America.    Captain Hillgrove began to think he had made a profitless voyage, though  be it said to his credit, he stood ever by Jack.    The latter met the words of scorn uttered against him with his  characteristic good-nature. Some of the nitrate was put in the hands of  competent chemists, and still more with practical agriculturists.    \"I shall win out,\" said Jack confidently.    \"I trust so with all my heart,\" answered Jenny.    At last some favorable reports came in and then the load of nitrates was  sold at a fair profit. Of the amount Jack got several hundred dollars, the  rest going to the captain of the _Elizabeth_.          Chapter XXIV    Jack and the Ocelot        The one most satisfied with the result of this first cargo of nitrate was  Captain Hillgrove. He had not expected great returns, but found himself so  well paid that he was willing to return for another load as soon as  possible.    Jack felt confident of his ultimate success. Already he was the possessor  of a fair sum, and with the apparently unlimited deposits of nitrate now  in his possession, he believed he could easily secure a fortune. As soon  as he should get back to Peru he resolved to get possession of other  nitrate beds before the price should advance.    But with that far-seeing sagacity of his he made no talk of what he had  done or what he had in mind. Quietly he went about his work, engaging  several ships to go to South America with him, prepared to return with  loads of the precious substance. He fitted up an office at home and put a  trusty man in the place to begin to work up a business. He had fondly  looked forward to giving this place to Plum Plucky, but stern fate had  decreed different plans.    Jenny was enthusiastic over her Jack's plans, and that they might not be  separated so long again she consented to their marriage, which took place  before he started on his second trip to Peru, and she accompanied him.    Now that Jack had really got started in his speculations, he studied how  best he might promote his interest. His young wife going with him to South  America, he resolved to locate in that country until he had got fairly  under control the gigantic business he intended to build up.    While successful in his nitrate ventures, he still preserved the  manuscript he had picked up in the convict cell on the island of Robinson  Crusoe, and he looked forward to the time when he should be able to visit  the strange lake in the Andes with means to reach its mysterious island of  buried treasure.    So at last, accompanied by a party of surveyors and explorers, armed with  papers which would make him the owner of the whole region as soon as the  boundaries could be fixed, he started for the place.    He had told his real object to no one, knowing that to do so would be to  ruin his prospects without benefiting any one permanently.    He had no difficulty in leading the way to the spur of the Andes where he  had met with his thrilling experience with the jaguars, and then the party  started for the rocky ridge overlooking the niche in the mountains holding  the Devil's Waters.    It was a route that Jack had traveled several times, and feeling in the  best of spirits, he set off on a galop, on the pony he was riding.    \"Poor Plum!\" he murmured, as he rode along. \"How I wish he was a live to  enjoy this with me.\"    On and on went our hero until he came to where there was a break in the  trail. He was absorbed in thought at the time and did not notice that his  pony turned to the left instead of the right.    The way seemed easy, and presently the pony set off on a galop, which soon  brought Jack out of his revery.    \"Hullo! where am I going?\" he asked himself, and brought his steed to a  halt. Then he gazed around in perplexity. \"I declare I must be lost!\"    With the memory of what had happened when he had been lost before, Jack  lost no time in turning back. But soon he became bewildered, and brought  his steed to a standstill a second time.    \"What does this mean, Firefly?\" he asked of the pony, but the animal could  not answer.    Jack heaved a sigh and then drew a pistol he carried.    \"I'll fire a shot--that will attract the attention of the others,\" he  reasoned. \"What a dunce I was to get lost! I surely make a fine leader!\"  Throwing up the pistol he discharged it. Hardly had he done so when his  pony started to bolt. Away dashed the steed under some trees and then  through a mass of vines, and Jack was thrown to the ground, striking on  his head as he fell,--and then his senses forsook him.    How long he laid where he had fallen he did not know exactly but when he  came to his senses, it was to find darkness around him. There was no rain,  but heavy clouds filled the air and a heavy breeze filled the woods around  him.  He got up slowly, to make certain that no bones were broken, and  then looked around for his pony. The animal had disappeared and could not  be found. His pistol was also gone.    \"Now I am surely in a pickle,\" reasoned Jack. \"The question is, what am I  to do next?\"    He knew his party must have gone on long before this. He would have to  find them in some way. But how?    Not relishing a stay in the bushes he started for higher ground. He had  not gone a dozen rods when he found himself at the edge of a ravine, lined  with tall trees and vines.    \"I certainly did not come that way,\" he said to himself. \"But beyond is  higher ground and I had better go up than down.\"    Thus reasoning, he looked around for some means of getting over the  ravine. A number of vines grew across, and he determined to test them and  if they were strong enough, to use them as a rope for getting across.    The vines appeared to be as firm as a cable, and without giving the matter  a second thought he launched himself forth and started to the other side  of the cut in the forest.    He had progressed less than two yards when he felt one end of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#19)"],[1,"K.'s former guardian, and so K.  was duty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed  for the night.  'I'm haunted by a ghost from the country', he would say.            As soon as they had greeted each other - K. had invited him to sit  in the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that - he said he wanted  to speak briefly with K. in private.  \"It is necessary,\" he said with a  tired gulp, \"it is necessary for my peace of mind.\"   K. immediately  sent the junior staff from the room and told them to let no-one in.  \"What's this that I've been hearing, Josef?\" cried K.'s uncle when they  were alone, as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself  without looking at them to make himself more comfortable.  K. said  nothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the effort  of the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and  looked out the window at the other side of the street.  From where he  sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it, part of the  empty walls of houses between two shop windows.  \"You're staring out the  window!\" called out his uncle, raising his arms, \"For God's sake, Josef,  give me an answer!  Is it true, can it really be true?\"  \"Uncle Karl,\"  said K., wrenching himself back from his daydreaming, \"I really don't  know what it is you want of me.\"  \"Josef,\" said his uncle in a warning  tone, \"as far as I know, you've always told the truth.  Am I to take  what you've just said as a bad sign?\"  \"I think I know what it is you  want,\" said K. obediently, \"I expect you've heard about my trial.\"  \"That's right,\" answered his uncle with a slow nod, \"I've heard about  your trial.\"  \"Who did you hear it from, then?\" asked K.  \"Erna wrote to  me,\" said his uncle, \"she doesn't have much contact with you, it's true,  you don't pay very much attention to her, I'm afraid to say, but she  learned about it nonetheless.  I got her letter today and, of course, I  came straight here.  And for no other reason, but it seems to me that  this is reason enough.  I can read you out the part of the letter that  concerns you.\"  He drew the letter out from his wallet.  \"Here it is.  She writes; 'I have not seen Josef for a long time, I was in the bank  last week but Josef was so busy that they would not let me through; I  waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my  piano lesson.  I would have liked to have spoken to him, maybe there  will be a chance another time.  He sent me a big box of chocolates for  my name-day, that was very nice and attentive of him.  I forgot to tell  you about it when I wrote, and I only remember now that you ask me about  it.  Chocolate, as I am sure you are aware, disappears straight away in  this lodging house, almost as soon as you know somebody has given you  chocolate it is gone.  But there is something else I wanted to tell you  about Josef.  Like I said, they would not let me through to see him at  the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then.  After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of  the staff whether his meeting would last much longer.  He said it might  well do, as it was probably about the legal proceedings, he said, that  were being conducted against him.   I asked what sort of legal  proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk,  and whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not  making any mistake, there were legal proceedings underway and even that  they were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more  about it.   He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief  clerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but  he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be  some influential gentlemen who would take his side.  I'm sure that is  what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the  end, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can  see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself.  Of course, I did not  place too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to  put the bank clerk's mind at rest, he was quite a simple man.  I told  him he was not to speak to anyone else about this, and I think it is all  just a rumour, but I still think it might be good if you, Dear Father,  if you looked into the matter the next time you visit.   It will be easy  for you to find out more detail and, if it is really necessary, to do  something about it through the great and influential people you know.  But if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at  least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look  forward to it.' - She's a good child,\" said K.'s uncle when he had  finished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes.  K. nodded.  With  all the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely  forgotten about Erna, even her birthday, and the story of the chocolates  had clearly just been invented so that he wouldn't get in trouble with  his aunt and uncle.  It was very touching, and even the theatre tickets,  which he would regularly send her from then on, would not be enough to  repay her,  but he really did not feel, now, that it was right for him  to visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little,  eighteen year old schoolgirl.  \"And what do you have to say about that?\"  asked his uncle, who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read  the letter, and seemed to be about to read it again.  \"Yes, Uncle,\" said  K., \"it is true.\"  \"True!\" called out his uncle. \"What is true?  How can  this be true?  What sort of trial is it?  Not a criminal trial, I hope?\"  \"It's a criminal trial,\" answered K.  \"And you sit quietly here while  you've got a criminal trial round your neck?\" shouted his uncle, getting  ever louder.  \"The more calm I am, the better it will be for the  outcome,\" said K. in a tired voice, \"don't worry.\"  \"How can I help  worrying?!\" shouted his uncle, \"Josef, my Dear Josef, think about  yourself, about your family, think about our good name!  Up till now,  you've always been our pride, don't now become our disgrace.  I don't  like the way you're behaving,\" he said, looking at K. with his head at  an angle, \"that's not how an innocent man behaves when he's accused of  something, not if he's still got any strength in him.  Just tell me what  it's all about so that I can help you.  It's something to do with the  bank, I take it?\"  \"No,\" said K. as he stood up, \"and you're speaking  too loud, Uncle, I expect one of the staff is listening at the door and  I find that rather unpleasant.  It's best if we go somewhere else, then  I can answer all your questions, as far as I can.  And I know very well  that I have to account to the family for what I do.\"  \"You certainly  do!\" his uncle shouted, \"Quite right, you do.  Now just get a move on,  Josef, hurry up now!\"  \"I still have a few documents I need to prepare,\"  said K., and, using the intercom, he summoned his deputy who entered a  few moments later.  K.'s uncle, still angry and excited, gestured with  his hand to show that K. had summoned him, even though there was no need  whatever to do so.  K. stood in front of the desk and explained to the  young man, who listened calm and attentive, what would need to be done  that day in his absence, speaking in a calm voice and making use of  various documents.   The presence of K.'s uncle while this was going on  was quite disturbing; he did not listen to what was being said,  but at  first he stood there with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips.  Then he began to walk up and down the room, stopped now and then at the  window, or stood in front of a picture always making various  exclamations such as, \"That is totally incomprehensible to me!\" or \"Now  just tell me, what are you supposed to make of that?!\"  The young man  pretended to notice nothing of this and listened to K.'s instructions  through to the end, he made a few notes, bowed to both K. and his uncle  and then left the room.  K.'s uncle had turned his back to him and was  looking out the window, bunching up the curtains with his outstretched  hands.  The door had hardly closed when he called out, \"At last!  Now  that he's stopped jumping about we can go too!\"  Once they were in the  front hall of the bank, where several members of staff were standing  about and where, just then, the deputy director was walking across,  there was unfortunately no way of stopping K.'s uncle from continually  asking questions about the trial.  \"Now then, Josef,\" he began, lightly  acknowledging the bows from those around them as they passed, \"tell me  everything about this trial; what sort of trial is it?\"  K. made a few  comments which conveyed little information, even laughed a little, and  it  was only when they reached the front steps that he explained to his  uncle that he had not wanted to talk openly in front of those people.  \"Quite right,\" said his uncle, \"but now start talking.\"  With his head  to one side, and smoking his cigar in short, impatient draughts, he  listened.  \"First of all, Uncle,\" said K., \"it's not a trial like you'd  have in a normal courtroom.\"  \"So much the worse,\" said his uncle.  \"How's that?\" asked K., looking at him.  \"What I mean is, that's for the  worse,\" he repeated.  They were standing on the front steps of the bank;  as the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they were saying K.  drew his uncle down further, where they were absorbed into the bustle of  the street.  His uncle took K.'s arm and stopped asking questions with  such urgency about the trial, they walked on for a while in silence.  \"But how did all this come about?\" he eventually asked, stopping  abruptly enough to startle the people walking behind, who had to avoid  walking into him.  \"Things like this don't come all of a sudden,"]]]
