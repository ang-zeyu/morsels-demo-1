We'll begin taking  her apart in a few days, and I don't want anything to happen between  now and then.\"    They walked on toward the big structure, and, as they approached from  the side, they were both startled to see a dark shadow--at least so it  seemed to the youths--dart away from one of the windows.    \"Look!\" gasped Ned.    \"Hello, there!\" cried Tom sharply. \"Who's that? Who are you?\"    There was no answer, and then the fleeing shadow was merged in the  other blackness of the night.    \"Maybe it was the watchman making his rounds,\" suggested Ned.    \"No,\" answered Tom, as he broke into a run. \"If it was, he'd have  answered. There's something wrong here!\"    But he could find nothing when he reached the window from which he and  Ned had seen the shadow dart. An examination by means of a pocket  electric light betrayed nothing wrong with the sash, and if there were  footprints beneath the casement they indicated nothing, for that side  of the factory was one frequently used by the workmen.    Tom went into the building, and, for a time, could not find the  watchman. When he did come upon the man, he found him rubbing his eyes  sleepily, and acting as though he had just awakened from a nap.    \"This isn't any way to be on duty!\" said Tom sharply.  \"You're not paid  for sleeping!\"    \"I know it, Mr. Swift,\" was the apologetic answer. \"I don't know what's  come over me to-night. I never felt so sleepy in all my life. I had my  usual sleep this afternoon, too, and I've drunk strong coffee to keep  awake.\"    \"Are you sure you didn't drink anything else?\"    \"You know I'm a strict temperance man.\"    \"I know you are,\" said Tom; \"but I thought maybe you might have a cold,  or something like that.\"    \"No, I haven't taken a thing. I did have a drink of soda water before I  came on duty, but that's all.\"    \"Where'd you get it?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, a man treated me.\"    \"Who?\"    \"I don't know his name. He met me on the street and asked me how to get  to Plowden's hardware store. I showed him--walked part of the way, in  fact--and when I left he said he was going to have some soda, and asked  me to have some. I did, and it tasted good.\"    \"Well, don't go to sleep again,\" suggested Tom good-naturedly.  \"Did  you hear anything at the side window a while ago?\"    \"Not a thing, Mr. Swift. I'll be all right now. I'll take a turn  outside in the air.\"    \"All right,\" assented the young inventor.    Then, as he turned to go into the house and was bidding Ned good-night,  Tom said:    \"I don't like this.\"    \"What?\" asked his chum.    \"My sleepy watchman and the figure at the window. I more than half  suspect that one of Blakeson's tools followed Kent for the purpose of  buying him soda, only I think they might have put a drop or two of  chloral in it before he got it.  That would make him sleep.\"    \"What are you going to do, Tom?\"    \"Put another man on guard. If they think they can get into the factory  at night, and steal my plans, or get ideas from my tank, I'll fool 'em.  I'll have another man on guard.\"    This Tom did, also telling Koku to sleep in the place, to be ready if  called. But there was no disturbance that night, and the next day the  work of completing the tank went on with a rush.    It was a day or so after this, and Tom had fixed on it as the time for  taking the big machine apart for shipment, that Ned received a  telephone message at the bank from Mr. Damon.    \"Is Tom Swift over with you?\" inquired the eccentric man.    \"No. Why?\" Ned answered.    \"Well, I'm at his shop, and he isn't here. His father says he received  a message from you a little while ago, saying to come over in a hurry,  and he went. Says you told him to meet you out at that farmer Kanker's  place. I thought maybe--\"    \"At Kanker's place!\" cried Ned. \"Say, something's wrong, Mr. Damon!  Isn't Tom there?\"    \"No; I'm at his home, and he's been gone for some time.  His father  supposed he was with you. I thought I would telephone to make sure.\"    \"Whew!\" whistled Ned. \"There's something doing here, all right, and  something wrong! I'll be right over!\" he added, as he hung up the  receiver.          Chapter XX    The Search      \"Haven't you seen anything of him?\" asked Mr. Damon, as Ned jumped out  of his small runabout at the Swift home as soon as possible after  receiving the telephone message that seemed to presage something wrong.    \"Seen him? No, certainly not!\" answered the young bank clerk. \"I'm as  much surprised as you are over it. What happened, anyhow?\"    \"Bless my memorandum pad, but I hardly know!\" answered the eccentric  man. \"I arrived here a little while ago, stopping in merely to pay Tom  a visit, as I often do, and he wasn't here. His father was anxiously  waiting for him, too, wishing to consult him about some shop matters.  Mr. Swift said Tom had gone out with you, or over to your house--I  wasn't quite sure which at first--and was expected back any minute.    \"Then I called you up,\" went on Mr. Damon, \"and I was surprised to  learn you hadn't seen Tom. There must be something wrong, I think.\"    \"I'm sure of it!\" exclaimed Ned. \"Let's find Mr. Swift.  And what's  this about his going to meet me over at the place of that farmer, Mr.  Kanker, where we had the trouble about the barn Tom demolished?\"    \"I hardly know, myself. Perhaps Mr. Swift can tell us.\"    But Mr. Swift was able to throw but little light on Tom's  disappearance--whether a natural or forced disappearance remained to be  seen.    \"No matter where he is, we'll get him,\" declared Ned. \"He hasn't been  away a great while, and it may turn out that his absence is perfectly  natural.\"    \"And if it's due to the plots of any of his rivals,\" said Mr. Damon,  \"I'll denounce them all as traitors, bless my insurance policy, if I  don't! And that's what they are!  They're playing into the hands of the  enemy!\"    \"All right,\" said Ned. \"But the thing to do now is to get Tom. Perhaps  Mrs. Baggert can help us.\"    It developed that the housekeeper was of more assistance in giving  information than was Mr. Swift.    \"It was several hours ago,\" she said, \"that the telephone rang and some  one asked for Tom. The operator shifted the call to the phone out in  the tank shop where he was, and Tom began to talk. The operator, as Tom  had instructed her, listened in, as Tom wants always a witness to most  matters that go on over his wires of late.\"    \"What did she hear?\" asked Ned eagerly.    \"She heard what she thought was your voice, I believe,\" the housekeeper  said.    \"Me!\" cried the young bank clerk. \"I haven't talked to Tom to-day, over  the phone or any other way. But what next?\"    \"Well, the operator didn't listen much after that, knowing that any  talk between Tom and you was of a nature not to need a witness. Tom  hung up and then he came in here, quite excited, and began to get ready  to go out.\"    \"What was he excited about?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Bless my unlucky stars,  but a person ought to keep calm under such circumstances! That's the  only way to do! Keep calm! Great Scott! But if I had my way, all those  German spies would be--Oh, pshaw! Nothing is too bad for them! It makes  my blood boil when I think of what they've done! Tom should have kept  cool!\"    \"Go on. What was Tom excited about?\" Ned turned to the housekeeper.    \"Well, he said you had called him to tell him to meet you over at that  farmer's place,\" went on Mrs. Baggert. \"He said you had some news for  him about the men who had tried to get hold of some of his tank  secrets, and he was quite worked up over the chance of catching the  rascals.\"    \"Whew!\" whistled Ned. \"This is getting more complicated every minute.  There's something deep here, Mr. Damon.\"    \"I agree with you, Ned. And the sooner we find Tom Swift the better.  What next, Mrs. Baggert?\"    \"Well, Tom got ready and went away in his small automobile. He said  he'd be back as soon as he could after meeting you.\"    \"And I never said a word to him!\" cried Ned. \"It's all a plot--a scheme  of that Blakeson gang to get him into their power. Oh, how could Tom be  so fooled? He knows my voice, over the phone as well as otherwise. I  don't see how he could be taken in.\"    \"Let's ask the telephone operator,\" suggested Mr. Damon.  \"She knows  your voice, too. Perhaps she can give us a clew.\"    A talk with the young woman at the telephone switchboard in the Swift  plant brought out a new point. This was that the speaker, in response  to whose information Tom Swift had left home, had not said he was Ned  Newton.    \"He said,\" reported Miss Blair, \"that he was speaking for you, Mr.  Newton, as you were busy in the bank. Whoever it was, said you wanted  Tom to meet you at the Kanker farm. I heard that much over the wire,  and naturally supposed the message came from you.\"    \"Well, that puts a little different face on it,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Tom  wasn't deceived by the voice, then, for he must have thought it was  some one speaking for you, Ned.\"    \"But the situation is serious, just the same,\" declared Ned. \"Tom has  gone to keep an appointment I never made, and the question is with whom  will he keep it?\"    \"That's it!\" cried the eccentric man. \"Probably some of those  scoundrels were waiting at the farm for him, and they've got him no one  knows where by this time!\"    \"Oh, hardly as bad as that,\" suggested Ned. \"Tom is able to look out  for himself. He'd put up a big fight before he'd permit himself to be  carried off.\"    \"Well, what do you think did happen?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I think they wanted to get him out to the farm to see if they couldn't  squeeze some more money out of him,\" was the answer. \"Tom was pretty  easy in that barn business, and I guess Kanker was sore because he  haven't asked a larger sum.  They knew Tom wouldn't come out on their  own invitation, so they forged my name, so to speak.\"    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#19)"],[1,"Unc Nunkie to life. His fault was  more thoughtless than wicked, but that did not alter the fact that he  had committed a fault. At first he had felt sorrow and remorse, but the  more he thought about the unjust treatment he had received--unjust  merely because he considered it so--the more he resented his arrest,  blaming Ozma for making foolish laws and then punishing folks who broke  them. Only a six-leaved clover! A tiny green plant growing neglected  and trampled under foot. What harm could there be in picking it? Ojo  began to think Ozma must be a very bad and oppressive Ruler for such a  lovely fairyland as Oz. The Shaggy Man said the people loved her; but  how could they?    The little Munchkin boy was so busy thinking these things--which many  guilty prisoners have thought before him--that he scarcely noticed all  the splendor of the city streets through which they passed. Whenever  they met any of the happy, smiling people, the boy turned his head away  in shame, although none knew who was beneath the robe.    By and by they reached a house built just beside the great city wall,  but in a quiet, retired place. It was a pretty house, neatly painted  and with many windows. Before it was a garden filled with blooming  flowers. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers led Ojo up the gravel path  to the front door, on which he knocked.    A woman opened the door and, seeing Ojo in his white robe, exclaimed:    \"Goodness me! A prisoner at last. But what a small one, Soldier.\"    \"The size doesn't matter, Tollydiggle, my dear. The fact remains that  he is a prisoner,\" said the soldier. \"And, this being the prison, and  you the jailer, it is my duty to place the prisoner in your charge.\"    \"True. Come in, then, and I'll give you a receipt for him.\"    They entered the house and passed through a hall to a large circular  room, where the woman pulled the robe off from Ojo and looked at him  with kindly interest. The boy, on his part, was gazing around him in  amazement, for never had he dreamed of such a magnificent apartment as  this in which he stood. The roof of the dome was of colored glass,  worked into beautiful designs. The walls were paneled with plates of  gold decorated with gems of great size and many colors, and upon the  tiled floor were soft rugs delightful to walk upon. The furniture was  framed in gold and upholstered in satin brocade and it consisted of  easy chairs, divans and stools in great variety. Also there were  several tables with mirror tops and cabinets filled with rare and  curious things. In one place a case filled with books stood against the  wall, and elsewhere Ojo saw a cupboard containing all sorts of games.    \"May I stay here a little while before I go to prison?\" asked the boy,  pleadingly.    \"Why, this is your prison,\" replied Tollydiggle, \"and in me behold your  jailor. Take off those handcuffs, Soldier, for it is impossible for  anyone to escape from this house.\"    \"I know that very well,\" replied the soldier and at once unlocked the  handcuffs and released the prisoner.    The woman touched a button on the wall and lighted a big chandelier  that hung suspended from the ceiling, for it was growing dark outside.  Then she seated herself at a desk and asked:    \"What name?\"    \"Ojo the Unlucky,\" answered the Soldier with the Green Whiskers.    \"Unlucky? Ah, that accounts for it,\" said she. \"What crime?\"    \"Breaking a Law of Oz.\"    \"All right. There's your receipt, Soldier; and now I'm responsible for  the prisoner. I'm glad of it, for this is the first time I've ever had  anything to do, in my official capacity,\" remarked the jailer, in a  pleased tone.    \"It's the same with me, Tollydiggle,\" laughed the soldier. \"But my task  is finished and I must go and report to Ozma that I've done my duty  like a faithful Police Force, a loyal Army and an honest Body-Guard--as  I hope I am.\"    Saying this, he nodded farewell to Tollydiggle and Ojo and went away.    \"Now, then,\" said the woman briskly, \"I must get you some supper, for  you are doubtless hungry. What would you prefer: planked whitefish,  omelet with jelly or mutton-chops with gravy?\"    Ojo thought about it. Then he said: \"I'll take the chops, if you  please.\"    \"Very well; amuse yourself while I'm gone; I won't be long,\" and then  she went out by a door and left the prisoner alone.    Ojo was much astonished, for not only was this unlike any prison he had  ever heard of, but he was being treated more as a guest than a  criminal. There were many windows and they had no locks. There were  three doors to the room and none were bolted. He cautiously opened one  of the doors and found it led into a hallway. But he had no intention  of trying to escape. If his jailor was willing to trust him in this way  he would not betray her trust, and moreover a hot supper was being  prepared for him and his prison was very pleasant and comfortable. So  he took a book from the case and sat down in a big chair to look at the  pictures.    This amused him until the woman came in with a large tray and spread a  cloth on one of the tables. Then she arranged his supper, which proved  the most varied and delicious meal Ojo had ever eaten in his life.    Tollydiggle sat near him while he ate, sewing on some fancy work she  held in her lap. When he had finished she cleared the table and then  read to him a story from one of the books.    \"Is this really a prison?\" he asked, when she had finished reading.    \"Indeed it is,\" she replied. \"It is the only prison in the Land of Oz.\"    \"And am I a prisoner?\"    \"Bless the child! Of course.\"    \"Then why is the prison so fine, and why are you so kind to me?\" he  earnestly asked.    Tollydiggle seemed surprised by the question, but she presently  answered:    \"We consider a prisoner unfortunate. He is unfortunate in two  ways--because he has done something wrong and because he is deprived of  his liberty. Therefore we should treat him kindly, because of his  misfortune, for otherwise he would become hard and bitter and would not  be sorry he had done wrong. Ozma thinks that one who has committed a  fault did so because he was not strong and brave; therefore she puts  him in prison to make him strong and brave. When that is accomplished  he is no longer a prisoner, but a good and loyal citizen and everyone  is glad that he is now strong enough to resist doing wrong. You see, it  is kindness that makes one strong and brave; and so we are kind to our  prisoners.\"    Ojo thought this over very carefully. \"I had an idea,\" said he, \"that  prisoners were always treated harshly, to punish them.\"    \"That would be dreadful!\" cried Tollydiggle. \"Isn't one punished enough  in knowing he has done wrong? Don't you wish, Ojo, with all your heart,  that you had not been disobedient and broken a Law of Oz?\"    \"I--I hate to be different from other people,\" he admitted.    \"Yes; one likes to be respected as highly as his neighbors are,\" said  the woman. \"When you are tried and found guilty, you will be obliged to  make amends, in some way. I don't know just what Ozma will do to you,  because this is the first time one of us has broken a Law; but you may  be sure she will be just and merciful. Here in the Emerald City people  are too happy and contented ever to do wrong; but perhaps you came from  some faraway corner of our land, and having no love for Ozma carelessly  broke one of her Laws.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ojo, \"I've lived all my life in the heart of a lonely  forest, where I saw no one but dear Unc Nunkie.\"    \"I thought so,\" said Tollydiggle. \"But now we have talked enough, so  let us play a game until bedtime.\"          Chapter Sixteen    Princess Dorothy      Dorothy Gale was sitting in one of her rooms in the royal palace, while  curled up at her feet was a little black dog with a shaggy coat and  very bright eyes. She wore a plain white frock, without any jewels or  other ornaments except an emerald-green hair-ribbon, for Dorothy was a  simple little girl and had not been in the least spoiled by the  magnificence surrounding her. Once the child had lived on the Kansas  prairies, but she seemed marked for adventure, for she had made several  trips to the Land of Oz before she came to live there for good. Her  very best friend was the beautiful Ozma of Oz, who loved Dorothy so  well that she kept her in her own palace, so as to be near her. The  girl's Uncle Henry and Aunt Em--the only relatives she had in the  world--had also been brought here by Ozma and given a pleasant home.  Dorothy knew almost everybody in Oz, and it was she who had discovered  the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, as well as  Tik-Tok the Clockwork Man. Her life was very pleasant now, and although  she had been made a Princess of Oz by her friend Ozma she did not care  much to be a Princess and remained as sweet as when she had been plain  Dorothy Gale of Kansas.    Dorothy was reading in a book this evening when Jellia Jamb, the  favorite servant-maid of the palace, came to say that the Shaggy Man  wanted to see her.    \"All right,\" said Dorothy; \"tell him to come right up.\"    \"But he has some queer creatures with him--some of the queerest I've  ever laid eyes on,\" reported Jellia.    \"Never mind; let 'em all come up,\" replied Dorothy.    But when the door opened to admit not only the Shaggy Man, but Scraps,  the Woozy and the Glass Cat, Dorothy jumped up and looked at her  strange visitors in amazement. The Patchwork Girl was the most curious  of all and Dorothy was uncertain at first whether Scraps was really  alive or only a dream or a nightmare. Toto, her dog, slowly uncurled  himself and going to the Patchwork Girl sniffed at her inquiringly; but  soon he lay down again, as if to say he had no interest in such an  irregular creation.    \"You're a new one to me,\" Dorothy said reflectively, addressing the  Patchwork Girl. \"I can't imagine where you've come from.\"    \"Who, me?\" asked Scraps, looking around the"]]]
