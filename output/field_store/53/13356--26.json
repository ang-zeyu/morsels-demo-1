You have no romance in your nature, no respect for the  past; you are a Goth and a Philistine.\"    \"I am afraid you are mixing up localities, Harry. I may be a Goth or a  Philistine, but perhaps you are not aware that these peoples or tribes  had no connection with each other. Your education in matters  unconnected with the Royal Navy seems to have been even more deplorably  neglected than my own.\"    \"Shut up, youngster!\"    \"No, Lieutenant Prendergast, you are not on the quarter-deck of one of  Her Majesty's ships at present. You are not even the leader of a small  caravan on the march. We are in this locanda on terms of perfect  equality, save and except in any small advantage that you may possess  in the matter of years.\"    Harry laughed.    \"Well, Bertie, I do not altogether disagree with what you say. If I had  come here to get up the history of the Incas, and investigate the ruins  of their palaces, I should be content to stay here for some weeks; but  as it is, I am really just as anxious as you are to be on the move. I  was speaking to Dias half an hour ago, and he says that in two more  days we shall be able to start again. We have been discussing how much  flour and other things it is absolutely necessary to take. Of course  the better provided we are the more comfortable we shall be; but on the  other hand, as Dias says, it is of great importance that the mules  should carry as little weight as possible.    \"In crossing the passes we shall have the benefit of the old roads of  the Incas, but once we leave these the difficulties will be enormous.  Dias said that it might be better to dispose of our mules altogether  and get trained llamas in their place, as these can climb over rocks  where no mule could obtain a foothold. But then it would be necessary  to take with us one or two natives accustomed to their ways, and this  would not suit us at all. However, I do think that it would be worth  while to take two or three of these animals with us. They can carry a  hundred pounds apiece; but as we may be going over extraordinarily  rough country, fifty pounds would be sufficient. The advantage would be  that we could establish a sort of central camp at the farthest spot to  which the mules could go, and then make exploring expeditions with the  llamas to carry provisions and tools. The llamas are not bad eating, so  that if we found no other use for them they would assist our  commissariat.\"    \"How far can they go in a day, Harry?\"    \"Ten or twelve miles, and you may be sure that that is as much as we  can do when we are among the mountains.\"    \"Then I should think they would be very useful. I suppose there will be  no difficulty in buying them?\"    \"None at all. A good many are brought in for sale to the market every  day. Of course it would be necessary to get strong animals accustomed  to burdens.\"    Before starting there was another long consultation between Harry and  Dias as to which course it would be better to adopt. The  most-frequented pass through the mountains was that to Paucartambo,  forty miles north-east from Cuzco, at the mouth of the pass that leads  down into the plains. Between this town and the Carabaya range, a  hundred and fifty miles to the south, was to be found the rich gold  deposit to which Dias had referred. So far, however, as the traditions  he had received informed him, it was situated near the slopes of the  Tinta volcano, and between that and Ayapata. The direct road to this  spot was extremely difficult, and he was of opinion that the journey  could be more easily performed by going to Paucartambo and then  skirting the foot of the mountains.    \"You will find no difficulty in obtaining food as you go along,\" he  said; \"wild turkeys, pheasants, and other birds are to be met with in  that district. Moreover, there are many plantations which have been  deserted owing to the depredations of the Chincas, a tribe who live on  the tributaries of the Pueros, or as it used to be called, Rio Madre de  Dios. Here you will find fields of maize still growing, sugar-cane,  cacao, and rice. One after another the estates have been abandoned; at  some of them the whole of the people on the farms were massacred, and  in all the danger was so great that the proprietors found it impossible  to work them. The one drawback to that road is that we may fall in with  the Chincas, in which case they will certainly attack us. However, they  are widely scattered through the forests, and we may not fall in with  them. On the other hand, the track by the Tinta mountain from Sicuani  is extremely difficult and dangerous, We might lose several of our  animals in traversing it, and should have to depend entirely on what we  carried for food.\"    \"Then by all means let us go the other way, Dias. Were we to lose some  of our mules it would be impossible to replace them, and it would be  useless to find gold if we could not carry it away.\"    Two days later they started, four llamas having been added to the  caravan. Dias explained that it would not be necessary to take any  natives to attend to these animals, as, once started, they would follow  the mules without difficulty, especially if they were fed with them  before starting. Three days' travelling brought them to the little  town, which lay very high up in the hills. The cold here was bitter,  and the party needed all their wraps, and were glad to get in motion as  soon as it was light. Passing over a range of mountains above  Paucartambo, where a thin layer of snow crunched under their feet, they  began the tremendous descent into the plain. In a short time the  morning mist cleared away. The road led through a tropical forest. It  took them over three hours to reach the river Chirimayu, a descent of  eleven thousand feet in the course of eight miles.    Here they halted by the side of a splendid waterfall. The hills rose up  perpendicularly on every side except where the little river made its  way through the gorge; they were covered with brushwood, ferns, and  creepers, thick with flowers of many colours, while lofty palms and  forest trees grew wherever their roots could find a hold. Splendid  butterflies of immense size flitted about; birds of many kinds and  beautiful plumage flew hither and thither among the trees;  humming-birds sucked the honey from the bright flowers; parrots  chattered and screamed in the upper branches of the trees, and the foam  and spray of the torrent sparkled in the sun. Harry and his brother  stood struck with admiration at the loveliness of the scene, even Donna  Maria and Jose ceased their chatter as they looked at a scene such as  they had never before witnessed.    \"It is worth coming all the way from England to see this, Bertie.\"    \"It is, indeed. If it is all like this I sha'n't mind how long Dias  takes to find the place he is in search of.\"    At a word from Dias they all set to work to take the burdens off the  animals. A place was cleared for the tents. When these had been erected  Jose collected dried sticks. A fire was soon lighted, and Maria began  to prepare breakfast.    \"Is it unhealthy here, Dias?\"    \"Not here, senors; we are still many hundred feet above the plain. In  the forest there it is unhealthy for whites, the trees grow so thickly  that it is difficult to penetrate them, swamps and morasses lie in many  places, and the air is thick and heavy. We shall not go down there  until we need. When we must descend we shall find an abundance of  maize, and fruits of all sorts. The savages kill the people they find  on the estates, but do not destroy the crops or devastate the fields.  They are wise enough to know that these are useful to them, and though  they are too lazy to work themselves they appreciate the good things  that others have planted.\"    \"It is rather early to make a halt, Dias.\"    \"We have work to do, senor. In the first place we must find a spot  where large trees stand on the bank of the torrent. Two or three of  these must be felled so that they fall across it; then we shall have to  chop off the branches, lay them flat side by side, and make a bridge  over which to take animals. After breakfast we must set about this  work, and it will be too late before we finish to think of going  farther to-day.\"    \"It is well that we bought four good axes and plenty of rope at Cuzco,\"  Harry said.    \"We shall want them very often, senor. Three large torrents come down  between this and the Tinta volcano, besides many smaller ones. Some  rise from the hills to the north of us. These fall into others, which  eventually combine to make the Madre de Dios. So far as is known boats  can descend the river to the Amazon without meeting with any obstacle,  from a point only a few miles from the head of the Pueros, which we  shall presently cross. The fact that there are no cataracts during the  whole course from the hills to the junction of the rivers, shows how  perfectly flat the great plain is.\"    \"And did either the Incas or the Spaniards ever conquer the Chincas and  cultivate these splendid plains?\"    \"The Incas drove them back some distance, senor, and forced them to pay  a tribute, but they never conquered them. Doubtless they cultivated the  land for some leagues from the foot of the mountains, as did the  Spaniards, and it was considered the most fertile part of the Montana,  as their possessions this side of the Cordilleras were called. The  Spaniards tried to push farther, but met with such stout opposition by  the savages that they were forced to desist.\"    All were ready when Maria announced breakfast. After the meal they sat  smoking for half an hour, reluctant to commence the heavy work before  them.    \"We had better be moving, senor,\" Dias said as he rose to his feet, \"or  we shall not get the bridge made before dark.\"    A hundred yards from the camp they found three large trees growing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/708"],[0,"The Princess and the Goblin (#19)"],[1,"which the spiders had spun far over the seas, which her grandmother had  sat in the moonlight and spun again for her, which she had tempered in  the rose-fire and tied to her opal ring, had left her--had gone where  she could no longer follow it--had brought her into a horrible cavern,  and there left her!  She was forsaken indeed!    'When shall I wake?' she said to herself in an agony, but the same  moment knew that it was no dream.  She threw herself upon the heap, and  began to cry.  It was well she did not know what creatures, one of them  with stone shoes on her feet, were lying in the next cave. But neither  did she know who was on the other side of the slab.    At length the thought struck her that at least she could follow the  thread backwards, and thus get out of the mountain, and home.  She rose  at once, and found the thread.  But the instant she tried to feel it  backwards, it vanished from her touch.  Forwards, it led her hand up to  the heap of stones--backwards it seemed nowhere. Neither could she see  it as before in the light of the fire.  She burst into a wailing cry,  and again threw herself down on the stones.        CHAPTER 21    The Escape    As the princess lay and sobbed she kept feeling the thread  mechanically, following it with her finger many times up to the stones  in which it disappeared.  By and by she began, still mechanically, to  poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could.  All at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the  stones and see where the thread went next. Almost laughing at herself  for never having thought of this before, she jumped to her feet.  Her  fear vanished; once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could  not have brought her there just to leave her there; and she began to  throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could, sometimes two  or three at a handful, sometimes taking both hands to lift one.  After  clearing them away a little, she found that the thread turned and went  straight downwards.  Hence, as the heap sloped a good deal, growing of  course wider towards its base, she had to throw away a multitude of  stones to follow the thread.  But this was not all, for she soon found  that the thread, after going straight down for a little way, turned  first sideways in one direction, then sideways in another, and then  shot, at various angles, hither and thither inside the heap, so that  she began to be afraid that to clear the thread she must remove the  whole huge gathering.  She was dismayed at the very idea, but, losing  no time, set to work with a will; and with aching back, and bleeding  fingers and hands, she worked on, sustained by the pleasure of seeing  the heap slowly diminish and begin to show itself on the opposite side  of the fire.  Another thing which helped to keep up her courage was  that, as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread, instead of lying  loose upon the stone, it tightened up; this made her sure that her  grandmother was at the end of it somewhere.    She had got about half-way down when she started, and nearly fell with  fright.  Close to her ears as it seemed, a voice broke out singing:      'Jabber, bother, smash!    You'll have it all in a crash.    Jabber, smash, bother!    You'll have the worst of the pother.    Smash, bother, jabber!--'      Here Curdie stopped, either because he could not find a rhyme to  'jabber', or because he remembered what he had forgotten when he woke  up at the sound of Irene's labours, that his plan was to make the  goblins think he was getting weak.  But he had uttered enough to let  Irene know who he was.    'It's Curdie!' she cried joyfully.    'Hush! hush!' came Curdie's voice again from somewhere.  'Speak softly.'    'Why, you were singing loud!' said Irene.    'Yes.  But they know I am here, and they don't know you are.  Who are  you?'    'I'm Irene,' answered the princess.  'I know who you are quite well.  You're Curdie.'    'Why, how ever did you come here, Irene?'    'My great-great-grandmother sent me; and I think I've found out why.  You can't get out, I suppose?'    'No, I can't.  What are you doing?'    'Clearing away a huge heap of stones.'    'There's a princess!' exclaimed Curdie, in a tone of delight, but still  speaking in little more than a whisper.  'I can't think how you got  here, though.'    'My grandmother sent me after her thread.'    'I don't know what you mean,' said Curdie; 'but so you're there, it  doesn't much matter.'    'Oh, yes, it does!' returned Irene.  'I should never have been here but  for her.'    'You can tell me all about it when we get out, then.  There's no time  to lose now,'said Curdie.    And Irene went to work, as fresh as when she began.    'There's such a lot of stones!' she said.  'It will take me a long time  to get them all away.'    'How far on have you got?' asked Curdie.    'I've got about the half away, but the other half is ever so much  bigger.'    'I don't think you will have to move the lower half.  Do you see a slab  laid up against the wall?'    Irene looked, and felt about with her hands, and soon perceived the  outlines of the slab.    'Yes,' she answered, 'I do.'    'Then, I think,' rejoined Curdie, 'when you have cleared the slab about  half-way down, or a bit more, I shall be able to push it over.'    'I must follow my thread,' returned Irene, 'whatever I do.'    'What do you mean?' exclaimed Curdie. 'You will see when you get out,'  answered the princess, and went on harder than ever.    But she was soon satisfied that what Curdie wanted done and what the  thread wanted done were one and the same thing.  For she not only saw  that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the  face of the slab, but that, a little more than half-way down, the  thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the  place where Curdie was confined, so that she could not follow it any  farther until the slab was out of her way. As soon as she found this,  she said in a right joyous whisper:    'Now, Curdie, I think if you were to give a great push, the slab would  tumble over.'    'Stand quite clear of it, then,' said Curdie, 'and let me know when you  are ready.'    Irene got off the heap, and stood on one side of it.  'Now, Curdie!'  she cried.    Curdie gave a great rush with his shoulder against it.  Out tumbled the  slab on the heap, and out crept Curdie over the top of it.    'You've saved my life, Irene!' he whispered.    'Oh, Curdie! I'm so glad!  Let's get out of this horrid place as fast  as we can.'    'That's easier said than done,' returned he.    'Oh, no, it's quite easy,' said Irene.  'We have only to follow my  thread.  I am sure that it's going to take us out now.'    She had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into the hole,  while Curdie was searching the floor of the cavern for his pickaxe.    'Here it is!' he cried.  'No, it is not,' he added, in a disappointed  tone.  'What can it be, then?  I declare it's a torch. That is jolly!  It's better almost than my pickaxe.  Much better if it weren't for  those stone shoes!' he went on, as he lighted the torch by blowing the  last embers of the expiring fire.    When he looked up, with the lighted torch casting a glare into the  great darkness of the huge cavern, he caught sight of Irene  disappearing in the hole out of which he had himself just come.    'Where are you going there?' he cried.  'That's not the way out. That's  where I couldn't get out.'    'I know that,' whispered Irene.  'But this is the way my thread goes,  and I must follow it.'    'What nonsense the child talks!' said Curdie to himself.  'I must  follow her, though, and see that she comes to no harm.  She will soon  find she can't get out that way, and then she will come with me.'    So he crept over the slab once more into the hole with his torch in his  hand.  But when he looked about in it, he could see her nowhere.  And  now he discovered that although the hole was narrow, it was much longer  than he had supposed; for in one direction the roof came down very low,  and the hole went off in a narrow passage, of which he could not see  the end.  The princess must have crept in there.  He got on his knees  and one hand, holding the torch with the other, and crept after her.  The hole twisted about, in some parts so low that he could hardly get  through, in others so high that he could not see the roof, but  everywhere it was narrow--far too narrow for a goblin to get through,  and so I presume they never thought that Curdie might.  He was  beginning to feel very uncomfortable lest something should have  befallen the princess, when he heard her voice almost close to his ear,  whispering:    'Aren't you coming, Curdie?'    And when he turned the next corner there she stood waiting for him.    'I knew you couldn't go wrong in that narrow hole, but now you must  keep by me, for here is a great wide place,' she said.    'I can't understand it,' said Curdie, half to himself, half to Irene.    'Never mind,' she returned.  'Wait till we get out.'    Curdie, utterly astonished that she had already got so far, and by a  path he had known nothing of, thought it better to let her do as she  pleased.  'At all events,' he said again to himself, 'I know nothing  about the way, miner as I am; and she seems to think she does know  something about it, though how she should passes my comprehension.  So  she's just as likely to find her way as I am, and as she insists on  taking the lead, I must follow.  We can't be much worse off than we  are, anyhow.'  Reasoning thus, he followed her a few steps, and came  out in another great cavern, across which Irene walked in a straight  line, as confidently as if she knew every step of the way.  Curdie went  on after her, flashing his torch about, and trying to see something of  what lay around them. Suddenly he started back a pace as the light fell  upon something close by"]]]
