The chief was among the first to return to the village, and as it was  he that Tarzan was most anxious to interview, he lost no time in  entering into a palaver with the black.    The fellow was short and stout, with an unusually low and degraded  countenance and apelike arms.  His whole expression denoted  deceitfulness.    Only the superstitious terror engendered in him by the stories poured  into his ears by the whites and blacks of the Russian's party kept him  from leaping upon Tarzan with his warriors and slaying him forthwith,  for he and his people were inveterate maneaters.  But the fear that he  might indeed be a devil, and that out there in the jungle behind him  his fierce demons waited to do his bidding, kept M'ganwazam from  putting his desires into action.    Tarzan questioned the fellow closely, and by comparing his statements  with those of the young warrior he had first talked with he learned  that Rokoff and his safari were in terror-stricken retreat in the  direction of the far East Coast.    Many of the Russian's porters had already deserted him.   In that very  village he had hanged five for theft and attempted desertion.  Judging,  however, from what the Waganwazam had learned from those of the  Russian's blacks who were not too far gone in terror of the brutal  Rokoff to fear even to speak of their plans, it was apparent that he  would not travel any great distance before the last of his porters,  cooks, tent-boys, gun-bearers, askari, and even his headman, would have  turned back into the bush, leaving him to the mercy of the merciless  jungle.    M'ganwazam denied that there had been any white woman or child with the  party of whites; but even as he spoke Tarzan was convinced that he  lied.  Several times the ape-man approached the subject from different  angles, but never was he successful in surprising the wily cannibal  into a direct contradiction of his original statement that there had  been no women or children with the party.    Tarzan demanded food of the chief, and after considerable haggling on  the part of the monarch succeeded in obtaining a meal.  He then tried  to draw out others of the tribe, especially the young man whom he had  captured in the bush, but M'ganwazam's presence sealed their lips.    At last, convinced that these people knew a great deal more than they  had told him concerning the whereabouts of the Russian and the fate of  Jane and the child, Tarzan determined to remain overnight among them in  the hope of discovering something further of importance.    When he had stated his decision to the chief he was rather surprised to  note the sudden change in the fellow's attitude toward him.  From  apparent dislike and suspicion M'ganwazam became a most eager and  solicitous host.    Nothing would do but that the ape-man should occupy the best hut in the  village, from which M'ganwazam's oldest wife was forthwith summarily  ejected, while the chief took up his temporary abode in the hut of one  of his younger consorts.    Had Tarzan chanced to recall the fact that a princely reward had been  offered the blacks if they should succeed in killing him, he might have  more quickly interpreted M'ganwazam's sudden change in front.    To have the white giant sleeping peacefully in one of his own huts  would greatly facilitate the matter of earning the reward, and so the  chief was urgent in his suggestions that Tarzan, doubtless being very  much fatigued after his travels, should retire early to the comforts of  the anything but inviting palace.    As much as the ape-man detested the thought of sleeping within a native  hut, he had determined to do so this night, on the chance that he might  be able to induce one of the younger men to sit and chat with him  before the fire that burned in the centre of the smoke-filled dwelling,  and from him draw the truths he sought.  So Tarzan accepted the  invitation of old M'ganwazam, insisting, however, that he much  preferred sharing a hut with some of the younger men rather than  driving the chief's old wife out in the cold.    The toothless old hag grinned her appreciation of this suggestion, and  as the plan still better suited the chief's scheme, in that it would  permit him to surround Tarzan with a gang of picked assassins, he  readily assented, so that presently Tarzan had been installed in a hut  close to the village gate.    As there was to be a dance that night in honour of a band of recently  returned hunters, Tarzan was left alone in the hut, the young men, as  M'ganwazam explained, having to take part in the festivities.    As soon as the ape-man was safely installed in the trap, M'Ganwazam  called about him the young warriors whom he had selected to spend the  night with the white devil!    None of them was overly enthusiastic about the plan, since deep in  their superstitious hearts lay an exaggerated fear of the strange white  giant; but the word of M'ganwazam was law among his people, so not one  dared refuse the duty he was called upon to perform.    As M'ganwazam unfolded his plan in whispers to the savages squatting  about him the old, toothless hag, to whom Tarzan had saved her hut for  the night, hovered about the conspirators ostensibly to replenish the  supply of firewood for the blaze about which the men sat, but really to  drink in as much of their conversation as possible.    Tarzan had slept for perhaps an hour or two despite the savage din of  the revellers when his keen senses came suddenly alert to a  suspiciously stealthy movement in the hut in which he lay.  The fire  had died down to a little heap of glowing embers, which accentuated  rather than relieved the darkness that shrouded the interior of the  evil-smelling dwelling, yet the trained senses of the ape-man warned  him of another presence creeping almost silently toward him through the  gloom.    He doubted that it was one of his hut mates returning from the  festivities, for he still heard the wild cries of the dancers and the  din of the tom-toms in the village street without.   Who could it be  that took such pains to conceal his approach?    As the presence came within reach of him the ape-man bounded lightly to  the opposite side of the hut, his spear poised ready at his side.    \"Who is it,\" he asked, \"that creeps upon Tarzan of the Apes, like a  hungry lion out of the darkness?\"    \"Silence, bwana!\" replied an old cracked voice.  \"It is Tambudza--she  whose hut you would not take, and thus drive an old woman out into the  cold night.\"    \"What does Tambudza want of Tarzan of the Apes?\" asked the ape-man.    \"You were kind to me to whom none is now kind, and I have come to warn  you in payment of your kindness,\" answered the old hag.    \"Warn me of what?\"    \"M'ganwazam has chosen the young men who are to sleep in the hut with  you,\" replied Tambudza.  \"I was near as he talked with them, and heard  him issuing his instructions to them.   When the dance is run well into  the morning they are to come to the hut.    \"If you are awake they are to pretend that they have come to sleep, but  if you sleep it is M'ganwazam's command that you be killed.  If you are  not then asleep they will wait quietly beside you until you do sleep,  and then they will all fall upon you together and slay you.  M'ganwazam  is determined to win the reward the white man has offered.\"    \"I had forgotten the reward,\" said Tarzan, half to himself, and then he  added, \"How may M'ganwazam hope to collect the reward now that the  white men who are my enemies have left his country and gone he knows  not where?\"    \"Oh, they have not gone far,\" replied Tambudza.   \"M'ganwazam knows  where they camp.  His runners could quickly overtake them--they move  slowly.\"    \"Where are they?\" asked Tarzan.    \"Do you wish to come to them?\" asked Tambudza in way of reply.    Tarzan nodded.    \"I cannot tell you where they lie so that you could come to the place  yourself, but I could lead you to them, bwana.\"    In their interest in the conversation neither of the speakers had  noticed the little figure which crept into the darkness of the hut  behind them, nor did they see it when it slunk noiselessly out again.    It was little Buulaoo, the chief's son by one of his younger wives--a  vindictive, degenerate little rascal who hated Tambudza, and was ever  seeking opportunities to spy upon her and report her slightest breach  of custom to his father.    \"Come, then,\" said Tarzan quickly, \"let us be on our way.\"    This Buulaoo did not hear, for he was already legging it up the village  street to where his hideous sire guzzled native beer, and watched the  evolutions of the frantic dancers leaping high in the air and cavorting  wildly in their hysterical capers.    So it happened that as Tarzan and Tambudza sneaked warily from the  village and melted into the Stygian darkness of the jungle two lithe  runners took their way in the same direction, though by another trail.    When they had come sufficiently far from the village to make it safe  for them to speak above a whisper, Tarzan asked the old woman if she  had seen aught of a white woman and a little child.    \"Yes, bwana,\" replied Tambudza, \"there was a woman with them and a  little child--a little white piccaninny.   It died here in our village  of the fever and they buried it!\"          Chapter 12    A Black Scoundrel      When Jane"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#19)"],[1,"the sides of the chest.    The animal should be allowed to drink but a limited amount of water. The  feed must be highly nutritious. Milk and eggs should be given if necessary.  A laxative dose of oil should be given. Calomel, aloes, and digitalis are  recommended when the effusion period approaches in order to increase the  elimination of fluid, and lessen its entrance into the body cavity. If the  amount of effusion is large, puncture of the thoracic cavity with a trocar  and cannula may be practised. This operation should be performed carefully,  and all possible precautions used against infection of the wound. During  the later period of the disease iodide of potassium, iron and bitter tonics  should be given.    BROKEN-WIND, HEAVES.--The terms broken-wind and heaves are used in a way to  include a number of different diseases of the respiratory organs of the  horse. The term heaves is applied almost wholly to an emphysematous  condition of the lungs. Broken-wind may include the following diseased  conditions: obstruction of the nasal passages by bony enlargements and  tumors; tumors in the pharynx; enlarged neck glands; collection of pus in  the guttural pouches and paralysis of the left, or both recurrent nerves  (roaring).    _The common causes_ of heaves are pre-existing diseases of the respiratory  organs, severe exercise when the animal is not in condition and wrong  methods of feeding. Heaves is more common in horses that are fed heavily on  dusty timothy and clover hay and allowed to drink large quantities of water  after feeding, than in horses that are fed green feeds, graze on pastures  or receive prairie hay for roughage. Chronic indigestion seems to aggravate  the disease. Over-distention of the stomach and intestines due to feeding  too much roughage and grain interferes with respiration. Severe exercise  when in this condition may result in over-distention, dilation and rupture  of the air cells. This is the most common structural change met with in the  lungs of horses affected with heaves. It is termed emphysema.    _The common symptoms_ noted are the double contraction of the muscles of  the flank with each expiration, a short, dry cough and the dilated  nostrils. The frequent passage of gas is a prominent symptom in  well-established cases of heaves. Chronic indigestion is commonly present  in heavy horses that are not well cared for, or are given hard work. This  condition aggravates the distressed breathing.    Heaves is a permanent disorder, but it may be relieved by climatic changes  and careful attention to the animal's diet.    The following _preventive treatment_ is recommended: Dusty hay should not  be fed to horses. Clover hay is not a safe feed for horses that are worked  hard. When starting on a drive after feeding, the horse should not be  driven fast, but allowed to go slowly for a few miles.    The symptoms can be greatly relieved by careful attention to the diet. A  limited quantity of roughage should be fed, and this should be good in  quality and fed in the evening. During the warm weather, the animal should  be watered frequently. After quitting work in the evening the animal may be  allowed to drink as much water as it wants. Plenty of grain, soft feed and  roots may be fed. A small handful of flaxseed meal given with the feed  helps in keeping down constipation. Fowler's solution of arsenic may be  given twice daily with the feed, in half-ounce doses for a period of ten  days or two weeks. Chronic indigestion should be combated by digestive  tonics.

The _heart_ is the central organ of the circulatory system  (Fig. 23). Its function is to force the blood through the blood-vessels. It  is situated in the thoracic cavity between the lungs, and enclosed by a  special fold of the pleura, the pericardial sack. There are two kinds of  blood-vessels, arteries and veins. The _arteries_ leave the heart and carry  the blood to the many different organs of the body. The _veins_ return to  the heart and carry the blood from the body tissues. The _capillaries_ are  small blood-vessels, microscopic in size, that connect the arteries with  the veins. The arteries carry the pure blood. The opposite is true,  however, of the lesser or pulmonary system. The pulmonary artery carries  the impure blood to the lungs, and the pulmonary veins carry the pure blood  back from the lungs. The _lymphatic vessels_ carry a transparent or  slightly colored fluid and chyle from the tissues and alimentary canal.  This system of vessels empties into the venous system.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Photograph of model of horse's heart: auricle;  ventricle; pulmonary artery; pulmonary veins; posterior aorta; and anterior  aorta.]    _The functions of the blood_ are to nourish the body tissues; furnish  material for the purpose of the body secretions; supply the cells of the  body with oxygen; convey from the tissues injurious substances produced by  the cellular activity; and destroy organisms that may have entered the body  tissues. The cellular and fluid portions of the blood are not always  destructive to disease-producing organisms. In certain infectious diseases,  the fluid portion of the blood may contain innumerable organisms, and  destruction of the blood cells occurs.    _In inflammation_ of tissue the circulation of the blood in the inflamed  part undergoes certain characteristic changes. At the beginning there is an  increase in the blood going to the part. This is followed by a slowing of  the blood stream in the small vessels, and the collecting of the blood  cells in the capillaries and veins. These circulatory changes are followed  by the migration of the blood cells, and the escape of the fluid portion of  the blood into the surrounding tissue. The character of the above  circulatory changes depends on the extent of the injury to the tissue.    PALPITATION.--This disturbance in domestic animals seems to be purely  functional. It may occur independent of any organic heart disease. A highly  nervous condition, excitement, over-exertion, debility from disease and the  feeding of an improper ration are the common causes.    The heart beats are so violent and tumultuous as to shake the body, and be  noticed when standing near the animal. The heart sounds are louder than  normal and the pulse beats small and irregular. It may be differentiated  from spasm of the diaphragm by determining the relationship of the heart  beats to the abrupt shocks observed in the costal and flank regions.    _The treatment_ consists in keeping the animal quiet and avoiding any  excitement. A quiet stall away from the other animals is best. The  treatment of palpitation resulting from some organic heart disease must be  directed largely at the original disease. Morphine is commonly used for the  treatment of this disorder. Weak, anaemic animals should receive blood and  bitter tonics. If we have reason to believe that the disturbance is caused  by improper feeding, the animal should receive a spare diet for a few days.  In such cases it is advisable to administer a physic.    PERICARDITIS.--Inflammation of the pericardial sack is usually a secondary  disease. It is frequently met with in influenza, contagious  pleuropneumonia, hog-cholera and rheumatism. Cattle may suffer from  traumatic pericarditis caused by sharp, pointed, foreign bodies passing  through the wall of the reticulum and penetrating the pericardial sack. The  jagged ends of fractured ribs may cause extensive injury to neighboring  parts, and the inflammation spreads to the pericardial sack.    _The symptoms_ of pericarditis may not be recognized at the very beginning  when the disease occurs as a complication of influenza, or infectious  pleuropneumonia. The manifestation of pain by moving about in the stall,  refusing to eat and the anxious expression of the face are the first  symptoms that the attendant may notice. The body temperature is higher than  normal, and the pulse rapid and irregular. On auscultation, friction sounds  that correspond to the tumultuous beats of the heart are heard. When fluid  collects within the pericardial sack, the heart beats become feeble and the  pulse weak. Labored breathing and bluish discoloration of the lips follow.  The disease usually runs a very acute course. The prognosis is unfavorable.    _The treatment_ recommended in pneumonia is indicated in this disease.  Absolute rest and the feeding of an easily digested, laxative diet is a  very essential part of the treatment. At the very beginning morphine may be  given to quiet the tumultuous beats of the heart. Cold applications to the  chest wall in the form of ice packs should be used. Heart tonics and  stimulants such as digitalis, strychnine and alcohol should be administered  when the pulse beats weaken. To promote absorption of the exudate, iodide  of sodium may be given. Mustard paste, or a cantharides blister applied  over the region of the heart is useful in easing the pain and overcoming  the inflammation. If fluid collects in sufficient quantity to seriously  interfere with the heart action, the sack may be punctured with the trocar  and cannula and the fluid withdrawn."]]]
