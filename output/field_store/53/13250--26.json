And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way  of truth shall be evil spoken of.\" (2 Peter 2:1, 2).    John the Revelator expressly predicted the restoration of the Gospel  (Rev. 14:6, 7); and such restoration would be impossible had not the  Gospel been taken from the earth. Book of Mormon Scriptures foretold in  plainness the great falling away and the subsequent restoration of the  Gospel of Christ. (See 1 Nephi 13: 5-9; 3 Nephi 16:7).    The Apostasy Affirmed    The apostate condition of Christendom has been recognized and affirmed  by high ecclesiastical authority. Let a single citation suffice. The  Church of England thus proclaims the fact of degeneracy, as set forth  in her \"Homily against Peril of Idolatry,\" published about the middle  of the sixteenth century and retained to this day as an official  declaration:    \"So that laity and clergy, learned and unlearned, all ages, sects,  and degrees of men, women, and children of whole Christendom--an  horrible and most dreadful thing to think--have been at once drowned in  abominable idolatry; of all other vices most detested of God, and most  damnable to man; and that by the space of eight hundred years and more.\"    By revelation through Joseph Smith the prophet the Lord thus confirmed  the predictions of His ancient servants with respect to the apostasy  of mankind: \"For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have  broken mine everlasting covenant. They seek not the Lord to establish  his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the  image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and  whose substance is that of an idol.\" (D&C 1:15, 16).    The universal apostasy has been succeeded by the restoration of the  Gospel, of which blessed truth the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints bears testimony to the world.    Footnotes    1. See the author's \"The Great Apostasy,\" 170 pp., _The Deseret News_,  Salt Lake City, Utah.        -- 30 --    THE MORNING BREAKS, THE SHADOWS FLEE    Light of the Gospel Again Shines    WE believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive  Church, viz.: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.  (Articles of Faith, No. 6).    As one of the signs whereby men may know when the Lord's coming is  near, Christ specified this feature of the latter times: \"And this  gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness  unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\" (Matt. 24:14). As this  follows in immediate sequence to our Lord's prediction of the general  apostasy, incident to which false prophets would arise, iniquity  abound, and love for the truth wax cold, an actual restoration of the  Gospel had to occur, or the Savior's words recorded in the 24th chapter  of Matthew would be inconsistent and their fulfilment impossible.    The Revelator John was shown the scenes of the days immediately before  the latter-day advent of the Christ. In recording the vision as then  already past he wrote:    \"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the  everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to  every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud  voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is  come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the  fountains of waters.\" (Rev. 14:6, 7).    If an angel was to come to earth, bringing the Gospel, the fact is  plain that the Gospel could not be at that time upon the earth. The  Gospel, which the angel would bring, was to be preached \"to every  nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\"; and this in strict and  logical consistency with the Lord's personal prophecy quoted above,  that one of the distinguishing signs of the last days was that the  Gospel of the kingdom, \"this Gospel,\" that is to say, the Gospel that  He had proclaimed, would be \"preached in all the world for a witness  unto all nations.\"    But, many have asked, had we not the Gospel? The Holy Bible, which  is the scriptural repository of the Gospel record has been among men  from the time of its earliest compilation; why then the necessity of a  restoration? Yes, we had the Bible; but the Gospel is something other  and greater than a book.    The Holy Scriptures, invaluable and sacred though they be, profess  to be only the letter of the Gospel. Is it reasonable to assume that  the mere possession of a Bible, or even a perfect memorization of its  contents, could give to man the authority to administer the ordinances  prescribed therein? It is quite as plausible to say that if one owns a  copy of the statutes of his state or nation and learns therefrom the  duties of sheriff, judge, governor or president, the knowledge thus  acquired would be authority for him to administer in the respective  offices. Statutes are not self-operative.    The Holy Scriptures define and prescribe certain administrative  ordinances, such as water baptism and the laying on of hands for the  bestowal of the Holy Ghost, which ordinances, unless the Lord Christ  spoke fable and falsehood, are indispensable to individual salvation.  But the right and authority to administer those essential and saving  ordinances cannot be arrogated to one's self by ever so intensive a  study of the scriptural record.    The angel seen by the Revelator, in vision of the then distant future,  was to bring to earth not the bare record and letter of requirement as  to baptism and other rites, for this the world already would have, in  part at least; but he was to restore to earth the Divine commission,  the actual appointment and authority to officiate in those sacred and  saving ordinances, in short the power of the Holy Priesthood, which the  world would not at that time possess.    We affirm that on the 15th of May, 1829, a heavenly messenger appeared  on the earth in light and glory, and, laying his hands upon the heads  of Joseph Smith and an associate in the ministry, Oliver Cowdery,  conferred upon them the Lesser or Aaronic Priesthood, saying:    \"Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the  Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels,  and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the  remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth,  until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in  righteousness.\" (D&C, Sec. 13).    The personage who thus appeared and officiated as an angel of light  announced himself as John, known of old as the Baptist, and stated that  he acted under instructions from the Apostles Peter, James, and John,  who held the presidency of the Higher or Melchizedek Priesthood in the  earlier Gospel dispensation. Later, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery  were visited by the presiding Apostles of old, Peter, James and John,  who ordained them to the Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek,  which comprises the fulness of authority operative in the Church of  Jesus Christ.    In accordance with this high commission the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints has been established; and presents to the world today  \"the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, viz.:  apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.\"    Come ye and share the priceless blessings of the restored Gospel, for  verily, the darkness of the long night of apostasy has been dispelled,  and the spiritual light of heaven again illumines the earth.    \"The morning breaks, the shadows flee;  Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled.  The dawning of a brighter day  Majestic rises on the world.\"        -- 31 --    THE BEGINNING OF THE END    Ushering in of the Last Dispensation    THE inauguration of the last or current dispensation of the Gospel of  Jesus Christ, which is verily the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times,  was in this wise.    In the year 1820 there lived at Manchester, N. Y., Joseph Smith Jr.  then in his fifteenth year, the third son in a respected and pious  family. At the time of which we speak great excitement with much  sectarian rivalry was manifest in religious matters, and the boy Joseph  was seriously concerned as to which of the contending sects was the  true Church of Christ; for it was plain that all could not be right.  Let us read the account written by himself.    \"During this time of great excitement, my mind was called up to serious  reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and  often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties,  though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would  permit. In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the  Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so  great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations,  that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted  with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right  and who was wrong.    \"My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great  and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists  and Methodists, and used all the powers of either reason or sophistry  to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were  in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn  were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and  disprove all others. In the midst of this war of words and tumult of  opinions, I often said to myself, What is to be done?

Pratt, p. 117.)    Speaking of the pleasure of his companionship with the Prophet, Elder  Pratt also says: \"As we journeyed day after day, and generally lodged  together, we had much sweet communion concerning the things of God  and the mysteries of His kingdom, and I received many admonitions and  instructions which I shall never forget.\" (Ibid., p. 117.)    4. Speaking of \"Father Beaman\" and his interesting family, Elder Parley  P. Pratt has the following interesting passage, which discloses the  fact that \"Father Beaman\" was acquainted with the work during the time  that the Book of Mormon was translating: \"Among those whose hospitality  we shared in that vicinity [Geneseo] was old Father Beaman and his  amiable and interesting family. He was a good singer, and so were his  three daughters; we were much edified and comforted in their society,  and were deeply interested in hearing the old gentleman and Brother  Joseph converse on their early acquaintance and history. He [Beaman]  had been intimate with Joseph long before the first organization of the  Church; had assisted him to preserve the plates of the Book of Mormon  from the enemy, and had at one time had them concealed under his own  hearth.\" (Ibid., pp. 117, 118.)    {46}        Chapter IV.

Willis, a young man who had been  in the Church for some time, and who was driven from Jackson county  into Clay county, returned thither to look for a stray cow, and while  at the house of Esquire Manship, a justice of the peace (where he had  called with Brother John Follet, to prove his title to the cow), was  caught by that unhung land pirate and inhuman monster, Moses Wilson,  and whipped in a most cruel and savage manner, while surrounded by some  half dozen of the old mobbers. This was an unpardonable act; all that  know Mr. Willis can bear testimony that he is a young man, honest,  peaceable and unoffending, working righteousness, and molesting no one,  May God reward Moses Wilson according to his works.    I went to Chardon today to attend the court in the case of \"Doctor\"  Philastus Hurlburt.    [Sidenote: The Trial of \"Doctor\" Hurlburt for Threatening the Prophet's  Life.]    _April 1_.--This day at Brother Rider's in Chardon. The court has not  brought forward Hurlburt's trial yet, and we were engaged in issuing  subpoenas for witnesses. My soul delighteth in the law of the Lord, for  He forgiveth my sins, and will confound mine enemies. The Lord shall  destroy him who has lifted his heel against me, even that wicked man  Dr. Philastus Hurlburt; He will deliver him to the fowls of heaven, and  his bones shall be cast to the blasts of the wind, for he lifted his  arm against the Almighty, therefore the Lord shall destroy him.    {47} Wednesday, April the 2nd, and Thursday, the 3rd, attended the  court. Hurlburt was on trial for threatening my life. Friday morning  I returned home, and in the evening attended Council, of which the  following are the minutes:        _Minutes of Council_.        Kirtland, April 4, 1834.        This evening a Council of High Priests assembled at the house of      President Joseph Smith, Jun., to reconsider the case of brother      George F. James. President Joseph Smith, Jun., presiding.        Brother George said that he had often promised to take up his cross      and magnify his calling, but had failed, and ought to have written      to the President ere this time and given him the information      that this pecuniary affairs called his attention at home, which      prevented his fulfilling the promise he made to President Joseph      Smith, in going out to proclaim the Gospel; and he sincerely asked      pardon of the Lord, and of his brethren, and particularly of      Brother Joseph. He also said he was willing to ask the forgiveness      of this Church. He said relative to certain charges, which were,      that he \"had not attended meetings, and had treated lightly some      of the weak,\" etc.; that he had attended meetings generally; and      as far as speaking or treating lightly any brother because of his      weakness, that was foreign from his mind, and was that which he had      never done, nor could he ever and such principles in his bosom.        President Joseph Smith said he had no hardness; he only wished      Brother George to consider this as a chastisement, and that the      Council were bound to take notice of his conduct heretofore; but      now, if Brother George was willing to walk according to the new      covenant, he should have his hand of fellowship. The Council then      expressed their satisfaction at Brother George's confession.        (Signed) Oliver Cowdery, Clerk.    _April 5--_I went to Chardon as a witness for Father Johnson, and  returned in the evening. Mr. Russell, the state's attorney for Portage  county, called on me. He approached me in a gentlemanly manner, and  treated me with great respect.    [Sidenote: Special Prayer.]    _April 7_.-Bishop Whitney, Elder Frederick G. Williams, Oliver Cowdrey,  Heber C. Kimball, and myself, met in the council room, and bowed down  before the Lord, and prayed that He would furnish the means to deliver  the Firm from debt, that they might be set at liberty; also, that I  might prevail {48} against that wicked man Hurlburt, and that he might  be put to shame.    The Presidency wrote Elder Orson Hyde, who yet remained in the state of  New York, as follows:        Kirtland, April 7, 1834.        Dear Brother Orson:--We received yours of the 31st ultimo in due      course of mail, and were much grieved on learning that you were not      likely to succeed according to our expectations. Myself, Brothers      Newel, Frederick and Oliver, retired to the translating room, where      prayer was wont to be made, and unbosomed our feelings before God;      and cannot but exercise faith yet that you, in the miraculous      providences of God, will succeed in obtaining help. The fact is,      unless we can obtain help, I myself cannot go to Zion, and if I do      not go, it will be impossible to get my brethren in Kirtland, any      of them, to go; and if we do not go, it is in vain for our eastern      brethren to think of going up to better themselves by obtaining so      goodly a land, (which now can be obtained for one dollar and one      quarter per acre,) and stand against that wicked mob; for unless      they do the will of God, God will not help them; and if God does      not help them, all is vain.        Now the fact is, this is the head of the Church and the life of the      body; and those able men, as members of the body, God has appointed      to be hands to administer to the necessities of the body. Now if a      man's hand refuses to administer to the necessities of his body,      it must perish of hunger; and if the body perish, all the members      perish with it; and if the head fail, the whole body is sickened,      the heart faints, and the body dies, the spirit takes its exit, and      the carcase remains to be devoured by worms.        Now, Brother Orson, if this Church, which is essaying to be the      Church of Christ will not help us, when they can do it without      sacrifice, with those blessings which God has bestowed upon them, I      prophesy--I speak the truth, I lie not--God shall take away their      talent, and give it to those who have no talent, and shall prevent      them from ever obtaining a place of refuge, or an inheritance upon      the land of Zion; therefore they may tarry, for they might as well      be overtaken where they are, as to incur the displeasure of God,      and fall under His wrath by the way side, as to fall into the hands      of a merciless mob, where there is no God to deliver, as salt that      has lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be      trodden under foot of men.        We therefore adjure you to beseech them, in the name of the Lord,      by the Son of God, to lend us a helping hand; and if all this will      not soften their hearts to administer to our necessity for Zion's      sake, turn your back upon them, and return speedily to Kirtland;      and the blood of {49} Zion be upon their heads, even as upon the      heads of her enemies; and let their recompense be as the recompense      of her enemies; for thus shall it come to pass, saith the Lord of      Hosts, who has the cattle upon a thousand hills, who has put forth      His Almighty hand to bring to pass His strange act; and what man      shall put forth his hand to steady the ark of God, or be found      turning a deaf ear to the voice of His servant? God shall speak in      due time, and all will be declared. Amen.        Your brethren in the New Covenant,        Joseph Smith, Jun.,        Frederick G. Williams,        Oliver Cowdery.    [Sidenote: Judgment Against Hurlburt.]    _April 9_.--After an impartial trial, the court decided that Dr.  Philastus Hurlburt be bound over, under two hundred dollar bonds,  to keep the peace for six months, and pay the cost, which amounted  to nearly three hundred dollars, all of which was in answer to our  prayers, for which I thank my Heavenly Father.
