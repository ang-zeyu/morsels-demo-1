[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#19)"],[1,", never had private  ends to foster, and never hesitated when there was something important  to be done. He was loyal to the Prophet, true to his brethren; and as  he was now a seventy, he wanted to magnify his office by service in the  missionary field.    He felt impressed that he wanted to take a mission to Fox Islands,  off the coast of Maine, although he was not at all familiar with the  locality nor with the conditions there. To his impressions of the  spirit of God, he found a hearty response in the minds of the apostles.    \"Feeling,\" he said, \"that it was my duty to start at once upon {71}  this mission, I did not tarry at home one year after having taken a  wife as the law of Moses allowed. On the contrary, I started just one  month and one day after that important event. I left my wife with  a Sister Hale with whom she expected to stay for a season. I left  Kirtland in good spirits, in company with Elder Jonathan Hale, and  walked twelve miles to Fairport, where we were joined by Elder Milton  Holmes. There we went aboard the steamer Sandusky, made our way to  Buffalo, and proceeded thence to Syracuse by way of the Erie Canal. We  then walked to Richland, Oswego County, New York, where I met my two  brothers whom I had not seen for several years.\" The elder of these  brothers had become, through trial and temptation, indifferent to the  Church. This was a source of deep sorrow to Wilford, who warned him  against opposing the truth, and faithfully instructed him in his duty  to the gospel which he had embraced.    From Richland they proceeded to Sackett's Harbor, thence across Lake  Ontario by steamer, Oneida, to Kingston, Upper Canada, and along the  canal to Jones' Falls, whence they walked to a place called Bastard,  Leeds County. There they found a branch of the Church presided over  by John E. Page and James Blakesly. \"We accompanied them to their  place of meeting,\" said Elder Woodruff, \"and attended a conference,  at which three hundred members of the Church were present. Thirty-two  persons presented themselves for ordination. I was asked to officiate  in company with Elder William Draper. We ordained seven elders, nine  priests, eleven teachers, and five deacons.    \"We addressed the people several times during this conference, and at  its close were called to administer to a woman who was possessed of  a devil. At times she was dumb and greatly afflicted with the evil  spirits that dwelt in her. She believed in Jesus, and in us as His  servants, and wished us to administer to her. Four of us laid our hands  upon her head, and in the name of Jesus Christ commanded the devil to  depart from her. The evil spirits left immediately, and the woman arose  with great joy and gave thanks and praise unto God; for, according to  her faith, she was made whole from that hour. A child that was sick was  also healed by the laying on of hands, according to the word of God.    {72} \"We walked thirty miles to visit another branch of the Saints  at Leeds, where we met with John Gordon and a John Snider. There we  held a meeting, and bore testimony to the people. A Sister Carns came  to us and asked that the ordinance for the healing of the sick be  performed for two of her children who were afflicted. One was a nursing  babe which was lying at the point of death. I took it in my arms and  presented it before the elders, who laid their hands upon it, and it  was made whole immediately. I handed it back to the mother entirely  healed. We afterwards laid hands upon the other, and it was also  healed. It was done by the power of God, in the name of Jesus Christ,  and the parents praised God for His goodness.\"    From Leeds they went to Schenectady, New York. On this journey they  were accompanied by Elders Isaac Russell, John Goodson, and John  Snider. In New York they expected to join Apostles Heber C. Kimball  and Orson Hyde who were soon to leave on a mission to England. Elder  Russell seemed to be troubled constantly by evil spirits. They were  also troublesome to him while in England, where Apostles Hyde and  Kimball had a severe contest with them, when administering to him.    After separating from the three brethren named, Elder Woodruff and his  companions went by rail to Albany, and walked from there to Canaan,  Connecticut, where they found a branch of the Church. Here they met  Jesse and Julian Moses and Francis K. Benedict. They held a two day's  meeting at Canaan, and Elder Woodruff ordained Julian Moses and Francis  K. Benedict to the office of an elder.    At Colebrook, Elder Woodruff visited his half-sister, Eunice Woodruff,  who taught school there. \"I spent five hours,\" he wrote, \"watching her  in the performance of her school duties. Five years before, when I last  beheld Eunice at our father's house, she was a child of only twelve  years; but now I beheld her an instructor of the youth. As I looked  upon her, my heart was filled with admiration for those accomplishments  in her which adorn the female sex. Her spirit was blithe, and her  step, as she moved among her pupils, showed the energy of youth. She  handed me a bundle of letters from her brother Asahel. The teachings  and instructions contained in those letters, if followed by the youth,  would lead them past a thousand snares. As I read, I {73} smiled and  wept, and prayed in my heart, 'O God, protect my brothers, my sisters,  my wife, and my parents.'\" Wilford's affection for his family and  relatives was strong and beautiful.    From Colebrook he proceeded to Avon. \"There I visited,\" he wrote, \"many  of my former neighbors, and my relatives, also the grave of my mother,  Beulah Woodruff, who died June 11th, 1808, when she was twenty-six  years of age. The following verse was upon her tombstone:      'A pleasing form, a generous heart,    A good companion, just without art;    Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend,    Beloved through life, lamented in the end.'    \"At the close of the day I walked six miles to Farmington, where my  father, Aphek Woodruff, was living, and I had the happy privilege of  once more meeting him and my stepmother, whom I had not seen for seven  years. They greeted me with great kindness. It was a happy meeting.  After visiting with my father for a day or two, I returned to Avon,  where most of my relatives lived, and held meetings with them. On the  12th of June, 1837, I baptized my uncle, Ozem Woodruff, his wife,  Hannah, and their son, John, and we rejoiced together; for this was in  fulfillment of a dream I had in 1818, when I was eleven years of age.    \"On the 15th of July I had an appointment to preach at the house of  my uncle, Adna Hart. While there I had the happy privilege of meeting  with my wife Phoebe W. Woodruff, who had come from Kirtland to meet me  and accompany me to her father's home in Scarboro, Maine. Those who  had assembled to hear me preach were relatives, neighbors, and former  friends. After meeting, we returned to Farmington, to my father's home,  where I spent the night with my father, stepmother, sister, and wife.  Elder Hale was also with us.    \"On the 19th of July, Elder Hale left us to go to his friends in  New Rowley, Massachusetts. The same evening I held a meeting in the  Methodist meetinghouse in the town of Farmington. I had a large  congregation of citizens with whom I {74} had been acquainted from  my youth. My parents, wife, and sister attended the meeting. The  congregation seemed satisfied with the doctrines I taught, and  requested me to hold another meeting; but I felt anxious to continue my  journey, and on the 20th of July I parted from father, stepmother, and  sister, and, with my wife, took stage for Hartford.    \"On my arrival there, not having money to pay fare for both of us,  I paid my wife's fare to Rowley, Massachusetts, where there was a  branch of the Church presided over by Brother Nathaniel Holmes, father  of Jonathan and Milton Holmes. I journeyed on foot. The first day I  walked fifty-two miles, the second day forty-eight, and the third day  thirty-six miles, arriving at Rowley at 2 o'clock, having made the one  hundred and thirty-six miles in a little over two and a half days. On  the second day, when within a mile or two of my stopping place, I felt  so weary and worn-out that every step was made with painful effort.  Just then a gentleman came dashing along in his carriage. As he came  up I prayed to the Lord that he would invite me to ride. Instead of  doing this, he went by with great speed until about ten rods ahead,  when his horse, without being spoken to, or reined up, and for some  cause unknown to the driver, came to a sudden stop. It appeared as if  a barrier, unseen by others, stood in his way. Instantly the gentleman  turned and asked me to ride. The invitation I accepted gladly, and we  sped on our way.    \"I spent eight days at New Rowley, holding meeting and visiting with  the Saints, including the Holmes family, and left there on the 1st of  August. On the 8th of August, in company with my wife and Elder Hale,  I visited my wife's father, Ezra Carter, and his family in Scarboro,  Maine, it being the first time I had ever seen any of her relatives.    \"We were received very kindly. My wife had been absent from her father's  home about one year. I remained eight days with Father Carter, and  household, and one day I went out to sea with Fabian and Ezra Carter,  my brothers-in-law, in a boat to fish with hooks. We caught two hundred  and fifty cod, haddock, and hake, and we saw four whales, two at a  time. It was the first time I had ever seen the kind of animal which is  said to have swallowed Jonah.    {75} \"On the 18th of August, 1837, I parted with my wife and her  father's household, leaving her with them, and, in company with  Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the mission that I had in view when I  left Kirtland. We walked ten miles to Portland, and took passage on  the steamboat, Bangor, which carried us to Owl's Head"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47707"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 3 (#19)"],[1,"of the Union. In other states the  war lasted at most but four years; but counting her western border  warfare in the struggle for Kansas, the war was waged in western  Missouri from 1855 to 1865, ten years: and for many years after the  close of the Civil War, a guerrilla warfare was intermittently carried  on by bands of outlaws harbored in western Missouri--especially  in Jackson, Ray, Caldwell and Clay counties--that terrorized the  community and shocked the world by the daring and atrocity of their  crimes--including bank robberies in open day, express train wrecking  and robberies, and murders. Not until 1881 was this effectually stopped  by the betrayal and murder of the outlaw chief of these bands.    Missouri sent into the Union Armies one hundred and nine thousand of  her sons, including eight thousand negroes. About thirty thousand  enlisted in the confederate army. According to official reports  the percentage of troops to population in the western states and  territories was 13.6 per cent, and in the New England states 12 per  cent; whilst in Missouri, if there be added to her quota sent to the  northern army the thirty thousand sent to the confederate army, her  percentage was fourteen per cent, _or sixty per cent of those who were  subject to military duty_. Of the deaths among these enlisted men, only  approximate {LXXIII} estimates may be made, since of the mortality  among the Confederates no official records were kept. But of those  who entered the Union service, thirteen thousand eight hundred and  eighty-five deaths are officially reported. The rate of mortality in  the Confederate forces, owing to the greater hardships they endured,  and the lack of medical attendants to care for the wounded, was much  higher, and is generally estimated at twelve thousand, (most of whom  were from western Missouri), which added to the deaths of those in the  Union army would aggregate the loss among the troops from Missouri to  twenty-five thousand eight hundred and eighty-five. \"This estimate,\"  says Lucien Carr, \"does not cover those who were killed in the  skirmishes that took place between the home guards and the guerrillas;  nor does it include those who were not in either army, but who were  shot down by \"bushwhackers\" and \"bushwhacking\" Federal soldiers. Of  these latter there is no record, though there were but few sections of  the state in which such scenes were not more or less frequent. Assuming  the deaths from these two sources to have been 1,200, and summing up  the results, it will be found that the number of Missourians who were  killed in the war and died from disease during their term of service  amounted to not less than 27,000 men.\" [75]    The loss in treasure was in full proportion to the loss in blood. The  state expended $7,000,000 in fitting out and maintaining her Union  troops in the field. [76] She lost $40,000,000 in slave property; and  four years after the close of the war--two of which, 1867-8, were  remarkably prosperous--the taxable wealth of the state was $46,000,000  less than it was in 1860. \"In many portions of the state,\" says the  historian to whom I am indebted for so many of the facts relating  to Missouri in these pages, \"especially in the southern and western  borders, whole counties had been devastated. The houses were burned,  the fences destroyed, and the farms laid waste. Much of the live stock  of the state had disappeared; and everywhere, even in those sections  that were comparatively quiet and peaceful, the quantity of land in  cultivation was much less than it had been at the outbreak of the war.  Added to these sources of decline, and in some measure a cause of  them, was the considerable emigration from the state which now took  place, and particularly from those regions that lay in the pathway  of the armies, or from those neighborhoods that were given over to  the \"bushwhackers.\" The amount of loss from these different sources  cannot be accurately gauged, but some idea may be formed of it, and of  the unsettled condition of affairs, from the fact that only 41 out of  the 113 counties in the state {LXXIV} receipted for the tax books for  1861; and in these counties, only $250,000 out of the $600,000 charged  against them were collected.\" [77]    This only in a general way indicates the losses in property sustained  by the state during the period under consideration, but it assists one  to understand somewhat the enormity of those losses.    It is in no spirit of gloating exultation that these facts in  Missouri's history are referred to here. It gives no gratification to  the writer to recount the woes of Missouri, and his hope is that it  will give none to the reader. These facts of history are set down only  because they are valuable for the lesson they teach. It may be that  visible retribution does not always follow in the wake of state or  national wrong-doing; but it is well that it should sometimes do so,  lest men should come to think that Eternal Justice sleeps, or may be  thwarted, or, what would be worst of all, that she does not exist. I  say it is well, therefore, that sometimes visible retribution should  follow state and national as well as individual transgressions, that  the truth of the great principle that \"as men sow, so shall they reap,\"  may be vindicated. Missouri in her treatment of the Latter-day Saints  during the years 1833-9, sowed the wind; in the disastrous events which  overtook her during the years 1855-65, she reaped the whirlwind. Let  us hope that in those events Justice was fully vindicated so far as  the state of Missouri is concerned; and that the lessons of her sad  experience may not be lost to the world. May the awful and visible  retribution visited upon Missouri teach all states and nations that  when they feel power they must not forget Justice; may it teach all  peoples that states and nations in their corporate capacity are such  entities as may be held accountable before God and the world for their  actions; that righteousness exalteth a nation, while injustice is  a reproach to any people. May the retribution that was so palpably  visited upon the state of Missouri satisfy and encourage the Latter-day  Saints; not that I would see them rejoice in the suffering of the  wicked; but rejoice rather in the evidence that Justice slumbereth not;  that their wrongs are not hidden from the All-seeing eye of God; that  they are within the circle of His love; that they cannot be unjustly  assailed with impunity, however humble and weak they may be. From all  these considerations may they be established in peace, hope, confidence  and charity; knowing that God is their friend; that His arm is strong  to protect; or, if in the course of God's economy in the management of  the affairs of the world it must needs be that for a time they suffer  at the hands of oppressors, that He will avenge them of their enemies;  and amply reward them for their sufferings in His cause.
