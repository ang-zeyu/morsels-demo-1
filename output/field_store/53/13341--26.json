Again the answer was \"no.\"    Then did that Indian offer the lodge and everything he had in it,  including his wife. But the trader was obdurate.    \"Why didn't you take it,\" said the friend whom he told of the  affair; \"the stuff would have netted five hundred dollars, and all  for one flask of whiskey.\"    \"Not much,\" said the trader, \"it was my last flask I wouldn't 'a'  had a drop for myself. But it just shows, how fond these Indians  are of whiskey.\"    While some of the Chipewyans show fine physique, and many do great  feats of strength and endurance, they seem on the whole inferior  to whites.    Thus the strongest portager on the river is said to be Billy  Loutit's brother George. At Athabaska Landing I was shown a house  on a hill, half a mile away, to which he had carried on his back  450 pounds of flour without stopping. Some said it was only 350  pounds, but none made it less. As George is only three-quarters  white, this is perhaps not a case in point. But during our stay  at Fort Smith we had several athletic meets of Indians and whites,  the latter represented by Preble and the police boys, and no matter  whether in running, walking, high jumping, broad jumping, wrestling,  or boxing, the whites were ahead.    As rifle-shots, also, the natives seem far inferior. In the matter  of moose-hunting only, as already noted, the red-man was master.  This, of course, is a matter of life-long training. A white man  brought up to it would probably do as well as an Indian even in  this very Indian department.    These tribes are still in the hunting and fishing stage; they make  no pretence of agriculture or stockraising. Except that they wear  white man's clothes and are most of them nominally Roman Catholics,  they live as their fathers did 100 years ago. But there is one  remarkable circumstance that impressed me more and more--practically  every Chipewyan reads and writes his own language.    This miracle was inborn on me slowly. On the first Buffalo hunt we  had found a smoothened pole stuck in the ground by the trail. It  was inscribed as herewith.    \"What is that Sousi?\" \"It's a notice from Chief William that Swiggert  wants men on the portage,\" and he translated it literally: \"The fat  white man 5 scows, small white man 2 scows, gone down, men wanted  for Rapids, Johnnie Bolette this letter for you. (Signed) Chief  William.\"    Each of our guides in succession had shown a similar familiarity  with the script of his people, and many times we found spideresque  characters on tree or stone that supplied valuable information.  They could, however tell me nothing of its age or origin, simply  \"We all do it; it is easy.\"    At Fort Resolution I met the Jesuit fathers and got the desired  chance of learning about the Chipewyan script.    First, it is not a true alphabet, but a syllabic; not letters, but  syllables, are indicated by each character; 73 characters are all  that are needed to express the whole language. It is so simple  and stenographic that the fathers often use it as a rapid way of  writing French. It has, however, the disadvantage of ambiguity at  times. Any Indian boy can learn it in a week or two; practically  all the Indians use it. What a commentary on our own cumbrous and  illogical spelling, which takes even a bright child two or three  years to learn!    Now, I already knew something of the Cree syllabic invented by  the Rev. James Evans, Methodist missionary on Lake Winnipeg in the  '40s, but Cree is a much less complex language; only 36 characters  are needed, and these are so simple that an intelligent Cree can  learn to write his own language in one day.    In support, of this astounding statement I give, first, the 36  characters which cover every fundamental sound in their language  and then a sample of application. While crude and inconcise, it  was so logical and simple that in a few years the missionary had  taught practically the whole Cree nation to read and write. And  Lord Dufferin, when the matter came before him during his north-west  tour, said enthusiastically: \"There have been men buried in  Westminster Abbey with national honours whose claims to fame were  far less than those of this devoted missionary, the man who taught  a whole nation to read and write.\"    These things I knew, and now followed up my Jesuit source of  information.    \"Who invented this?\"    \"I don't know for sure. It is in general use.\"    \"Was it a native idea?\"    \"Oh, no; some white man made it.\"    \"Where? Here or in the south?\"    \"It came originally from the Crees, as near as we can tell.\"    \"Was it a Cree or a missionary that first thought of it?\"    \"I believe it was a missionary.\"    \"Frankly, now, wasn't it invented in 1840 by Rev. James Evans,  Methodist missionary to the Crees on Lake Winnipeg?\"    Oh, how he hated to admit it, but he was too honest to deny it.    \"Yes, it seems to me it was some name like that. 'Je ne sais pas.'\"    Reader, take a map of North America, a large one, and mark off the  vast area bounded by the Saskatchewan, the Rockies, the Hudson Bay,  and the Arctic circle, and realise that in this region, as large  as continental Europe outside of Russia and Spain, one simple,  earnest man, inspired by the love of Him who alone is perfect  love, invented and popularised a method of writing that in a few  years--in less than a generation, indeed--has turned the whole native  population from ignorant illiterates to a people who are proud to  read and write their own language. This, I take it, is one of the  greatest feats of a civiliser. The world has not yet heard, much  less comprehended, the magnitude of the achievement; when it does  there will be no name on the Canadian roll of fame that will stand  higher or be blazoned more brightly than that of James Evans the  missionary.          CHAPTER XXIII    THE DOGS OF FORT RESOLUTION        It sounds like the opening of an epic poem but it is not.    The Chipewyan calender is divided in two seasons--dog season and  canoe season. What the horse is to the Arab, what the Reindeer is  to the Lap and the Yak to the Thibetan, the dog is to the Chipewyan  for at least one-half of the year, until it is displaced by the  canoe.    During dog season the canoes are piled away somewhat carelessly or  guarded only from the sun. During canoe season the dogs are treated  atrociously. Let us remember, first, that these are dogs in every  doggy sense, the worshipping servants of man, asking nothing but  a poor living in return for abject love and tireless service, as  well as the relinquishment of all family ties and natural life. In  winter, because they cannot serve without good food, they are well  fed on fish that is hung on scaffolds in the fall in time to be  frozen before wholly spoiled. The journeys they will make and the  devoted service they render at this time is none too strongly set  forth in Butler's \"Cerf Vola\" and London's \"Call of the Wild.\" It  is, indeed, the dog alone that makes life possible during the white  half-year of the boreal calender. One cannot be many days in the  north without hearing tales of dog prowess, devotion, and heroism.  A typical incident was related as follows by Thomas Anderson:    Over thirty years ago, Chief Factor George McTavish and his driver,  Jack Harvey, were travelling from East Main to Rupert's House (65  miles) in a blizzard so thick and fierce that they could scarcely  see the leading dog. He was a splendid, vigorous creature, but all  at once he lay down and refused to go. The driver struck him, but  the factor reproved the man, as this dog had never needed the whip.  The driver then went ahead and found open water only a few feet  from the dogs, though out of sight. After that they gave the leader  free rein, surrendered themselves to his guidance, and in spite of  the blinding blizzard they struck the flagpole of Rupert's between  11 and 12 that night, only a little behind time.    Many of the wild Wolf traits still remain with them. They commonly  pair; they bury surplus food; the mothers disgorge food for the  young; they rally to defend one of their own clan against a stranger;  and they punish failure with death.    A thousand incidents might be adduced to show that in the north  there is little possibility of winter travel without dogs and little  possibility of life without winter travel.    But April comes with melting snows and May with open rivers and  brown earth everywhere; then, indeed, the reign of the dog is over.  The long yellow-birch canoe is taken down from the shanty roof or  from a sheltered scaffold, stitched, gummed, and launched; and the  dogs are turned loose to fend for themselves. Gratitude for past  services or future does not enter into the owner's thoughts to  secure a fair allowance of food. All their training and instinct  prompts them to hang about camp, where, kicked, stoned, beaten,  and starved, they steal and hunt as best they may, until the sad  season of summer is worn away and merry winter with its toil and  good food is back once more.    From leaving Fort MacMurray we saw daily the starving dog, and  I fed them when I could. At Smith Landing the daily dog became a  daily fifty. One big fellow annexed us. \"I found them first,\" he  seemed to say, and no other dog came about our camp without a fight.    Of course he fared well on our scraps, but many a time it made my  heart ache and my food-store suffer to see the gaunt skeletons in  the bushes, just beyond his sphere of influence, watching for a  chance to rush in and secure a mouthful of--anything to stay the  devastating pang. My journal of the time sets forth in full detail  the diversity of their diet, not only every possible scrap of  fish and meat or whatsoever smelled of fish or meat, but rawhide,  leather, old boots, flour-bags, potato-peelings, soap, wooden  fragments of meat-boxes, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#19)"],[1,"Riseholme was never supposed to last more than half an hour, however  much you were enjoying it, and never less, however bored you might be,  and he felt sure he had already exceeded this.    \"I must be off,\" he said. \"Too delightful to think that you and Mr  Shuttleworth will come to lunch with me tomorrow. Half past one, shall  we say?\"    \"Excellent; but where do you live?\"    \"Just across the green. Shall I call for you?\" he asked.    \"Certainly not. Why should you have that bother?\" she said. \"Ah, let me  come with you to the inn-door, and perhaps you will shew me from  there.\"    She passed through the hall with him, and they stood together in the  sight of all Riseholme, which was strolling about the green at this as  at most other hours. Instantly all faces turned round in their  direction, like so many sunflowers following the sun, while Georgie  pointed out his particular mulberry tree. When everybody had had a good  look, he raised his hat.    _\"A domani_ then,\" she said. \"So many thanks.\"    And quite distinctly she kissed her hand to him as he turned away....    \"So she talks Italian too,\" thought Georgie, as he dropped little  crumbs of information to his friends on his way to his house.  _\"Domani,_ that means tomorrow. Oh yes; she was meaning lunch.\"    It is hardly necessary to add that on the table in his hall there was  one of Lucia's commoner kinds of note, merely a half sheet folded  together in her own manner. Georgie felt that it was scarcely more  necessary to read it, for he felt quite sure that it contained some  excuse for not coming to his house at six in order to call on Mr and  Mrs Bracely. But he gave a glance at it before he rolled it up in a  ball for Tipsipoozie to play with, and found its contents to be  precisely what he expected, the excuse being that she had not done her  practising. But the post-script was interesting, for it told him that  she had asked Foljambe to give her his copy of Siegfried....    Georgie strolled down past The Hurst before dinner. Mozart was silent  now, but there came out of the open windows the most amazing hash of  sound, which he could just recognise as being the piano arrangement of  the duet between Brunnhilde and Siegfried at the end. He would have  been dull indeed if he had not instantly guessed what _that_  signified.          Chapter SEVEN      A fresh thrill went through an atmosphere already super-saturated with  excitement, when next morning all Lucia's friends who had been bidden  to the garden-party (Tightum) were rung up on the telephone and  informed that the party was Hightum. That caused a good deal of extra  work, because the Tightum robes had to be put away again, and the  Hightums aired and brushed and valetted. But it was well worth it, for  Riseholme had not the slightest difficulty in conjecturing that Olga  Bracely was to be among the guests. For a cultured and artistic centre  the presence of a star that blazed so regally in the very zenith of the  firmament of art absolutely demanded the Hightum which the presence of  poor Lady Ambermere (though she would not have liked that) had been  powerless to bring out of their cupboards. And these delightful  anticipations concentrated themselves into one rose-coloured point of  joy, when no less than two independent observers, without collusion,  saw the piano-tuner either entering or leaving The Hurst, while a  third, an ear-witness, unmistakably heard the tuning of the piano  actually going on. It was thus clear to all penetrating minds that Olga  Bracely was going to sing. It was further known that something was  going on between her and Georgie, for she had been heard by one Miss  Antrobus to ask for Georgie's number at the telephone in the Ambermere  Arms. Etiquette forbade her actually to listen to what passed, but she  could not help hearing Olga laugh at something (presumably) that  Georgie said. He himself took no part in the green-parliament that  morning, but had been seen to dash into the fruiterer's and out again,  before he went in a great hurry to The Hurst, shortly after  twelve-thirty. Classes on Eastern philosophy under the tuition of  Mrs Quantock's Indian, were already beginning to be hinted at, but  today in the breathless excitement about the prima-donna nobody cared  about that; they might all have been taking lessons in cannibalism,  and nobody would have been interested. Finally about one o'clock one  of the motors in which the party had arrived yesterday drew up at the  door of the Ambermere Arms, and presently Mr Bracely,--no, dear, Mr  Shuttleworth got in and drove off alone. That was very odd conduct in a  lately-married bridegroom, and it was hoped that there had been no  quarrel.    Olga had, of course, been given no directions as to Hightum or Tightum,  and when she walked across to Georgie's house shortly after half-past  one only Mrs Weston who was going back home to lunch at top speed was  aware that she was dressed in a very simple dark blue morning frock,  that would almost have passed for Scrub. It is true that it was  exceedingly well cut, and had not the look of having been rolled up in  a ball and hastily ironed out again that usually distinguished Scrub,  and she also wore a string of particularly fine pearls round her neck,  the sort of ornament that in Riseholme would only be seen in an  evening Hightum, even if anybody in Riseholme had owned such things.  Lucia, not long ago had expressed the opinion that jewels were vulgar  except at night, and for her part she wore none at all, preferring one  Greek cameo of uncertain authenticity.    Georgie received Olga alone, for Hermy and Ursy were not yet back from  their golf.    \"It is good of you to let me come without my husband,\" she said. \"His  excuse is toothache and he has driven into Brinton--\"    \"I'm very sorry,\" said Georgie.    \"You needn't be, for now I'll tell you his real reason. He thought that  if he lunched with you he would have to come on to the garden party,  and that he was absolutely determined not to do. You were the thin edge  of the wedge, in fact. My dear, what a delicious house. All panelled,  with that lovely garden behind. And croquet--may we play croquet after  lunch? I always try to cheat, and if I'm found out I lose my temper.  Georgie won't play with me, so I play with my maid.\"    \"This Georgie will,\" said he.    \"How nice of him! And do you know what we did this morning, before the  toothache didn't begin? We went all over that house three doors away,  which is being done up. It belongs to the proprietor of the Ambermere  Arms. And--oh, I wonder if you can keep a secret?\"    \"Yes,\" said Georgie. He probably had never kept one yet, but there was  no reason why he shouldn't begin now.    \"Well, I'm absolutely determined to buy it, only I daren't tell my  husband until I've done it. He has an odd nature. When a thing is done,  settled, and there's no help for it, he finds it adorable, but he also  finds fatal objections to doing it at all, if he is consulted about it  before it is done. So not a word! I shall buy it, make the garden,  furnish it, down to the minutest detail, and engage the servants, and  then he'll give it me for a birthday present. I had to tell somebody or  I should burst.\"    Georgie nearly swooned with fervour and admiration.    \"But what a perfect plan!\" he said. \"You really like our little  Riseholme?\"    \"It's not a question of liking; it's a mere detail of not being able to  do without it. I don't like breathing, but I should die if I didn't. I  want some delicious, hole-in-the-corner, lazy backwater sort of place,  where nothing ever happens, and nobody ever does anything. I've been  observing all the morning, and your habits are adorable. Nothing ever  happens here, and that will precisely suit me, when I get away from my  work.\"    Georgie was nearer swooning than ever at this. He could hardly believe  his ears when she talked of Riseholme being a lazy backwater, and  almost thought she must have been speaking of London, where, as Lucia  had acutely observed, people sat in the Park all morning and talked of  each other's affairs, and spent the afternoon at picture-galleries, and  danced all night. There was a flippant, lazy existence.    But she was far too much absorbed in her project to notice his  stupefaction.    \"But if you breathe a word,\" she said, \"everything will be spoilt. It  has to burst on Georgie. Oh, and there's another mulberry-tree in your  garden as well as the one in front. It's too much.\"    Her eyes followed Foljambe out of the door.    \"And I know your parlour-maid is called Paravicini or Grosvenor,\" she  said.    \"No, she is Foljambe,\" said Georgie.    She laughed.    \"I knew I was right,\" she said. \"It's practically the same thing. Oh,  and last night! I never had such an awful evening. Why didn't you warn  me, and my husband should have had toothache then instead of this  morning.\"    \"What happened?\" asked he.    \"But the woman's insane, that Ambermere parrot, I mean. Georgie and I  were ten minutes late, and she had a jet tiara on, and why did she ask  us to dine at a quarter to eight, if she meant a quarter to eight,  instead of saying half-past-seven? They were actually going into dinner  when we came, a mournful procession of three moth-eaten men and three  whiskered women. Upon which the procession broke up, as if we had been  the riot act, and was arranged again, as a funeral procession, and  Georgie with Lady Ambermere was the hearse. We dined in the family  vault and talked about Lady Ambermere's pug. She talked about you, too,  and said you were of county family, and that Mrs Lucas was a very  decent sort of woman, and that she herself was going to look in on her  garden-party today. Then she looked at my pearls, and asked if they  were genuine. So I looked at her teeth, and there was no need to ask  about them.\"    \"Don't miss out a moment,\" said Georgie greedily.    \"Whenever Lady Ambermere"]]]
