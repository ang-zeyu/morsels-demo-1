But as he was advanced to higher places  of trust, so he became more entangled in the affairs of state, the  consequence of which proved very prejudicial to him. The duke of  Lancaster having been the chief instrument of raising him to dignity,  expected the fruits of those favours in a ready compliance with him  in all his designs. That prince was certainly one of the proudest and  most ambitious men of his time, nor could he patiently bear the name  of a subject even to his father; nothing but absolute power, and the  title of king could satisfy him; upon the death of his elder brother,  Edward the black prince, he fixed an eye upon the English crown, and  seemed to stretch out an impatient hand to reach it. In this view he  sought, by all means possible, to secure his interest against the  decease of the old king; and being afraid of the opposition of the  clergy, who are always strenuous against an irregular succession, he  embraced the opinions and espoused the interests of Wickliff, who now  appeared at Oxford, and being a man of very great abilities, and much  esteemed at court, drew over to his party great numbers, as well  fashionable as low people. In this confusion, the duke of Lancaster  endeavoured all he could to shake the power of the clergy, and to  procure votaries amongst the leading popular men. Chaucer had no small  hand in promoting these proceedings, both by his public interest and  writings. Towards the close of Edward's reign, he was very active in  the intrigues of the court party, and so recommended himself to the  Prince successor, that upon his ascending the throne, he confirmed to  him by the title of Dilectus Armiger Noster, the grant made by the  late king of twenty marks per annum, and at the same time confirmed  the other grant of the late King for a pitcher of wine to be delivered  him daily in the port of London. In less than two years after this, we  find our poet so reduced in his cirumstances, (but by what means is  unknown) that the King in order to screen him from his creditors, took  him under his protection, and allowed him still to enjoy his former  grants. The duke of Lancaster, whose restless ambition ever excited  him to disturb the state, engaged now with, all the interest of  which he was master to promote himself to the crown; the opinions of  Wickliff gained ground, and so great a commotion now prevailed amongst  the clergy, that the king perceiving the state in danger, and being  willing to support the clerical interest, suffered the archbishop of  Canterbury to summon Wickliff to appear before him, whose interest  after this arraignment very much decayed.[2] The king who was devoted  to his pleasures, resigned himself, to some young courtiers who hated  the duke of Lancaster, and caused a fryar to accuse him of an attempt  to kill the king; but before he had an opportunity of making out the  charge against him, the fryar was murdered in a cruel and barbarous  manner by lord John Holland, to whose care he had been committed. This  lord John Holland, called lord Huntingdon, and duke of Exeter, was  half brother to the King, and had married Elizabeth, daughter of  the duke of Lancaster. He was a great patron of Chaucer, and much  respected by him. With the duke of Lancaster's interest Chaucer's  also sunk. His patron being unable to support him, he could no longer  struggle against opposite parties, or maintain his posts of honour.  The duke passing over sea, his friends felt all the malice of an  enraged court; which induced them to call in a number of the populace  to assist them, of which our poet was a zealous promoter. One John  of Northampton, a late lord mayor of London was at the head of these  disturbances; which did not long continue; for upon beheading one of  the rioters, and Northampton's being taken into custody, the commotion  subsided. Strict search was made after Chaucer, who escaped into  Hainault; afterwards he went to France, and finding the king resolute  to get him into his hands, he fled from thence to Zealand. Several  accomplices in this affair were with him, whom he supported in their  exile, while the chief ringleaders, (except Northampton who was  condemned at Reading upon the evidence of his clerk) had restored  themselves to court favour by acknowledging their crime, and now  forgot the integrity and resolution of Chaucer, who suffered exile to  secure their secrets; and so monstrously ungrateful were they, that  they wished his death, and by keeping supplies of money from him,  endeavoured to effect it;--While he expended his fortune in removing  from place to place, and in supporting his fellow exiles, so far from  receiving any assistance from England, his apartments were let, and  the money received for rent was never acccounted for to him; nor could  he recover any from those who owed it him, they being of opinion  it was impossible for him ever to return to his own country. The  government still pursuing their resentment against him and his  friends, they were obliged to leave Zealand, and Chaucer being unable  to bear longer the calamities of poverty and exile, and finding no  security wherever he fled, chose rather to throw himself upon the laws  of his country, than perish abroad by hunger and oppression. He had  not long returned till he was arrested by order of the king, and  confined in the tower of London. The court sometimes flattered  him with the return of the royal favour if he would impeach his  accomplices, and sometimes threatened him with immediate destruction;  their threats and promises he along while disregarded, but  recollecting the ingratitude of his old friends, and the miseries he  had already suffered, he at last made a confession, and according to  the custom of trials at that time, offered to prove the truth of it by  combat. What the consequence of this discovery was to his accomplices,  is uncertain, it no doubt exposed him to their resentment, and  procured him the name of a traytor; but the king, who regarded him as  one beloved by his grandfather, was pleased to pardon him. Thus fallen  from a heighth of greatness, our poet retired to bemoan the fickleness  of fortune, and then wrote his Testament of Love, in which are many  pathetic exclamations concerning the vicissitude of human things,  which he then bitterly experienced. But as he had formerly been the  favourite of fortune, when dignities were multiplied thick upon him,  so his miseries now succeeded with an equal swiftness; he was not only  discarded by his majesty, unpensioned, and abandoned, but he lost the  favour of the duke of Lancaster, as the influence of his wife's sister  with that prince was now much lessened. The duke being dejected with  the troubles in which he was involved, began to reflect on his  vicious course of life, and particularly his keeping that lady as  his concubine; which produced a resolution of putting her out of his  house, and he made a vow to that purpose. Chaucer, thus reduced, and  weary of the perpetual turmoils at court, retired to Woodstock, to  enjoy a studious quiet; where he wrote his excellent treatise of the  Astrolabe; but notwithstanding the severe treatment of the government,  he still retained his loyalty, and strictly enjoined his son to pray  for the king. As the pious resolutions of some people are often the  consequence of a present evil, so at the return of prosperity they are  soon dissipated. This proved the case with the duke of Lancaster: his  party again gathered strength, his interest began to rise; upon which  he took again his mistress to his bosom, and not content with heaping  favours, honours, and titles upon her, he made her his wife, procured  an act of parliament to legitimate her children, which gave great  offence to the duchess of Gloucester, the countess of Derby, and  Arundel, as she then was entitled to take place of them. With her  interest, Chaucer's also returned, and after a long and bitter storm,  the sun began to shine upon him with an evening ray; for at the  sixty-fifth year of his age, the king granted to him, by the title of  Delectus Armiger Noster, an annuity of twenty marks per annum  during his life, as a compensation for the former pension his needy  circumstances obliged him to part with; but however sufficient that  might be for present support, yet as he was encumbered with debts,  he durst not appear publickly till his majesty again granted him his  royal protection to screen him from the persecution of his creditors;  he also restored to him his grant of a pitcher of wine daily, and a  pipe annually, to be delivered to him by his son Thomas, who that year  possessed the office of chief butler to the king.    Now that I have mentioned his son, it will not be improper, to take  a view of our author's domestical affairs, at least as far as we are  enabled, by materials that have descended to our times.    Thomas his eldest son, was married to one of the greatest fortunes in  England, Maud, daughter and heir of Sir John Burgheershe, knight of  the garter, and Dr. Henry Burghurshe bishop of Lincoln, chancellor  and treasurer of England. Mr. Speight says this lady was given him in  marriage by Edward III. in return of his services performed in his  embassies in France. His second son Lewis was born in 1381, for when  his father wrote the treatise of the Astrolabe, he was ten years  old; he was then a student in Merton college in Oxford, and pupil to  Nicholas Strade, but there is no further account of him. Thomas who  now enjoyed the office of chief butler to his majesty, had the same  place confirmed to him for life, by letters patent to king Henry IV,  and continued by Henry VI. In the 2d year of Henry IV, we find him  Speaker of the House of Commons, Sheriff of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#2)"],[1,"moment.    If Teeka had not been so absorbed in her own vaingloriousness she might  have noted the rustling of leaves in the tree above her--a rustling  which was not caused by any movement of the wind, since there was no  wind.  And had she looked up she might have seen a sleek body crouching  almost directly over her and wicked yellow eyes glaring hungrily down  upon her, but Teeka did not look up.    With his wound Taug had backed off growling horribly.  Tarzan had  followed him, screaming insults at him, and menacing him with his  brandishing blade.  Teeka moved from beneath the tree in an effort to  keep close to the duelists.    The branch above Teeka bent and swayed a trifle with the movement of  the body of the watcher stretched along it.  Taug had halted now and  was preparing to make a new stand.  His lips were flecked with foam,  and saliva drooled from his jowls.  He stood with head lowered and arms  outstretched, preparing for a sudden charge to close quarters.  Could  he but lay his mighty hands upon that soft, brown skin the battle would  be his.  Taug considered Tarzan's manner of fighting unfair.  He would  not close.  Instead, he leaped nimbly just beyond the reach of Taug's  muscular fingers.    The ape-boy had as yet never come to a real trial of strength with a  bull ape, other than in play, and so he was not at all sure that it  would be safe to put his muscles to the test in a life and death  struggle.  Not that he was afraid, for Tarzan knew nothing of fear.  The instinct of self-preservation gave him caution--that was all.  He  took risks only when it seemed necessary, and then he would hesitate at  nothing.    His own method of fighting seemed best fitted to his build and to his  armament.  His teeth, while strong and sharp, were, as weapons of  offense, pitifully inadequate by comparison with the mighty fighting  fangs of the anthropoids.  By dancing about, just out of reach of an  antagonist, Tarzan could do infinite injury with his long, sharp  hunting knife, and at the same time escape many of the painful and  dangerous wounds which would be sure to follow his falling into the  clutches of a bull ape.    And so Taug charged and bellowed like a bull, and Tarzan of the Apes  danced lightly to this side and that, hurling jungle billingsgate at  his foe, the while he nicked him now and again with his knife.    There were lulls in the fighting when the two would stand panting for  breath, facing each other, mustering their wits and their forces for a  new onslaught.  It was during a pause such as this that Taug chanced to  let his eyes rove beyond his foeman.  Instantly the entire aspect of  the ape altered.  Rage left his countenance to be supplanted by an  expression of fear.    With a cry that every ape there recognized, Taug turned and fled.  No  need to question him--his warning proclaimed the near presence of their  ancient enemy.    Tarzan started to seek safety, as did the other members of the tribe,  and as he did so he heard a panther's scream mingled with the  frightened cry of a she-ape.  Taug heard, too; but he did not pause in  his flight.    With the ape-boy, however, it was different.  He looked back to see if  any member of the tribe was close pressed by the beast of prey, and the  sight that met his eyes filled them with an expression of horror.    Teeka it was who cried out in terror as she fled across a little  clearing toward the trees upon the opposite side, for after her leaped  Sheeta, the panther, in easy, graceful bounds.  Sheeta appeared to be  in no hurry.  His meat was assured, since even though the ape reached  the trees ahead of him she could not climb beyond his clutches before  he could be upon her.    Tarzan saw that Teeka must die.  He cried to Taug and the other bulls  to hasten to Teeka's assistance, and at the same time he ran toward the  pursuing beast, taking down his rope as he came.  Tarzan knew that once  the great bulls were aroused none of the jungle, not even Numa, the  lion, was anxious to measure fangs with them, and that if all those of  the tribe who chanced to be present today would charge, Sheeta, the  great cat, would doubtless turn tail and run for his life.    Taug heard, as did the others, but no one came to Tarzan's assistance  or Teeka's rescue, and Sheeta was rapidly closing up the distance  between himself and his prey.    The ape-boy, leaping after the panther, cried aloud to the beast in an  effort to turn it from Teeka or otherwise distract its attention until  the she-ape could gain the safety of the higher branches where Sheeta  dared not go.  He called the panther every opprobrious name that fell  to his tongue.  He dared him to stop and do battle with him; but Sheeta  only loped on after the luscious titbit now almost within his reach.    Tarzan was not far behind and he was gaining, but the distance was so  short that he scarce hoped to overhaul the carnivore before it had  felled Teeka.  In his right hand the boy swung his grass rope above his  head as he ran.  He hated to chance a miss, for the distance was much  greater than he ever had cast before except in practice.  It was the  full length of his grass rope which separated him from Sheeta, and yet  there was no other thing to do.  He could not reach the brute's side  before it overhauled Teeka.  He must chance a throw.    And just as Teeka sprang for the lower limb of a great tree, and Sheeta  rose behind her in a long, sinuous leap, the coils of the ape-boy's  grass rope shot swiftly through the air, straightening into a long thin  line as the open noose hovered for an instant above the savage head and  the snarling jaws.  Then it settled--clean and true about the tawny  neck it settled, and Tarzan, with a quick twist of his rope-hand, drew  the noose taut, bracing himself for the shock when Sheeta should have  taken up the slack.    Just short of Teeka's glossy rump the cruel talons raked the air as the  rope tightened and Sheeta was brought to a sudden stop--a stop that  snapped the big beast over upon his back.  Instantly Sheeta was  up--with glaring eyes, and lashing tail, and gaping jaws, from which  issued hideous cries of rage and disappointment.    He saw the ape-boy, the cause of his discomfiture, scarce forty feet  before him, and Sheeta charged.    Teeka was safe now; Tarzan saw to that by a quick glance into the tree  whose safety she had gained not an instant too soon, and Sheeta was  charging.  It was useless to risk his life in idle and unequal combat  from which no good could come; but could he escape a battle with the  enraged cat? And if he was forced to fight, what chance had he to  survive? Tarzan was constrained to admit that his position was aught  but a desirable one.  The trees were too far to hope to reach in time  to elude the cat.  Tarzan could but stand facing that hideous charge.  In his right hand he grasped his hunting knife--a puny, futile thing  indeed by comparison with the great rows of mighty teeth which lined  Sheeta's powerful jaws, and the sharp talons encased within his padded  paws; yet the young Lord Greystoke faced it with the same courageous  resignation with which some fearless ancestor went down to defeat and  death on Senlac Hill by Hastings.    From safety points in the trees the great apes watched, screaming  hatred at Sheeta and advice at Tarzan, for the progenitors of man have,  naturally, many human traits.  Teeka was frightened.  She screamed at  the bulls to hasten to Tarzan's assistance; but the bulls were  otherwise engaged--principally in giving advice and making faces.  Anyway, Tarzan was not a real Mangani, so why should they risk their  lives in an effort to protect him?    And now Sheeta was almost upon the lithe, naked body, and--the body was  not there.  Quick as was the great cat, the ape-boy was quicker.  He  leaped to one side almost as the panther's talons were closing upon  him, and as Sheeta went hurtling to the ground beyond, Tarzan was  racing for the safety of the nearest tree.    The panther recovered himself almost immediately and, wheeling, tore  after his prey, the ape-boy's rope dragging along the ground behind  him.  In doubling back after Tarzan, Sheeta had passed around a low  bush.  It was a mere nothing in the path of any jungle creature of the  size and weight of Sheeta--provided it had no trailing rope dangling  behind.  But Sheeta was handicapped by such a rope, and as he leaped  once again after Tarzan of the Apes the rope encircled the small bush,  became tangled in it and brought the panther to a sudden stop.  An  instant later Tarzan was safe among the higher branches of a small tree  into which Sheeta could not follow him.    Here he perched, hurling twigs and epithets at the raging feline  beneath him.  The other members of the tribe now took up the  bombardment, using such hard-shelled fruits and dead branches as came  within their reach, until Sheeta, goaded to frenzy and snapping at the  grass rope, finally succeeded in severing its strands.  For a moment  the panther stood glaring first at one of his tormentors and then at  another, until, with a final scream of rage, he turned and slunk off  into the tangled mazes of the jungle.    A half hour later the tribe was again upon the ground, feeding as  though naught had occurred to interrupt the somber dullness of their  lives.  Tarzan had recovered the greater part of his rope and was busy  fashioning a new noose, while Teeka squatted close behind him, in  evident token that her choice was made.    Taug eyed them sullenly.  Once when he came close, Teeka bared her  fangs and growled at him, and Tarzan showed his canines in an ugly  snarl; but Taug did not provoke a quarrel.  He seemed to accept after  the manner of his kind the decision of the she as an indication that he  had been vanquished in his battle for her favors.    Later in the day, his rope repaired, Tarzan took to the trees in search  of game.  More than"]]]
