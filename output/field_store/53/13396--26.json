It is not expected that the host or hostess can devote the entire  day to guests. Sir Walter Scott's conduct towards his guests at  Abbotsford furnishes a model of hospitality. He never saw them  till dinner; but whilst he was busily engaged in writing, he left  his house, servants, carriages, horses, and grounds at their  entire disposal.    Byron gives a perfect picture of guest life at a country house:    \"The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,  Or hunt; the young, because they liked the sport  The first thing boys like, after play and fruit;  The middle-aged, to make the day more short;  For ennui is a growth of English root,  Though nameless in our language-we retort  The fact for words, and let the French translate  That awful yawn which sleep cannot abate.    \"The elderly walked through the library,  And tumbled books, or criticized the pictures,  Or sauntered through the garden piteously,   And made upon the hot-house several strictures;  Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,   Or in the morning papers read their lectures;  Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,  Longing at sixty for the hour of six.\"    \"But none were 'gene;' the great hour of union  Was rung by dinner's knell! till then all were  Masters of their own time-or in communion,  Or solitary, as they chose to bear  The hours,-which how to pass to few is known.  Each rose up at his own, and had to spare  What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast  When, where, and how he chose for that repast.\"'    In this country, hospitality is but seldom conducted on the lavish  broad scale possible at an English country residence; but, as far  as possible, it is better to allow guests perfect liberty for  breakfast hour and morning employments.    Great discretion must be used among guests to avoid all criticism  on their host, his friends, his household, his manner of living,  and all that concerns him. If anything goes wrong during the  visit, one should seem not to see it. If the dinner is late, it is  very impolite to appear impatient. If any plan falls to the  ground, no comments or disapproval must be indulged in, and no  disappointment betrayed. If the children of the house are  fractious, or noisy, or ill-bred, a visitor must never find fault  with their behavior.    The same caution must be exercised in the treatment of your  friend's friends. They may be such as you do not care to become  intimate with; but you must not evince dislike or special  avoidance, and must always have recourse rather to a negative than  a positive line of conduct. A person of tact can always keep  people at a distance without hurting their feelings.    Your host's horses, carriages, books, and grounds should be even  more carefully used than if they were your own. A goodnatured man  will delight in seeing his visitors enjoy all the good things he  places at their disposal; but they should not abuse his  indulgence. To ride a horse too far or too fast, to dog's-ear or  blot the books in the library, to gather choice and favorite  flowers, are all signs of an under-bred and selfish nature. Above  all, we should be thoughtful in our treatment of the servants,  never commenting upon their shortcomings, or scolding them.    The religious opinions, especially of those from whom we are  receiving hospitality, must on no account be shocked, scoffed at,  or in any way treated with a want of respect. If our friends go  regularly to church, we should accompany them there; or, without  remark, repair to the place of worship most agreeable to our own  religious convictions. If family prayers are read, we should  endeavor to be present. If silent grace is the custom at meal  times, our heads must also bow, and a short mental prayer be said.  If the Sunday is observed with great strictness, we should refrain  from any pursuits to which objection could possibly be made, even  if they appear to ourselves perfectly proper and innocent. In  short, we must remember that for the time the feelings and  prejudices of the host and hostess are our own.    There is no occasion when it is more necessary to remember that  social intercourse is made up of innumerable little acts of  kindness, self-denial, charity, chivalry, and good-fellowship,  than when a number of people find themselves thrown together for  companionship in the house of some mutual friend.    Letters delivered in the presence of the host or hostess, or when  the other guests are present, must not be opened until the  receiver asks permission to read them.    A lady may never offer to pay any of the expenses incurred by  taking her about--carriage hire, steamboat fares, or such outlay  nor must a gentleman do so unless he is the only gentleman of the  party. It will then be well for the hostess, before starting, to  hand him the necessary tickets previously purchased.    When a guest is ready to leave you, be sure that the trunks are  strapped and ticketed, a carriage ready in good season, a luncheon  prepared for refreshment upon the journey, a substantial meal  ready in good season for comfortable enjoyment of it, and the  departure made as pleasant as possible.    \"Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.\" It is the first  duty of the guest, after returning home, to write to the host or  hostess, expressing the pleasure derived from the visit, and  mentioning each member of the family by name, desiring to be  remembered to all.      STREET ETIQUETTE.    WHEN a gentleman recognizes a friend in the course of his walk, he  must lift his hat with the hand farthest from him. Lifting the hat  is a sufficient recognition between gentlemen; but in meeting a  lady, an old gentleman, or a clergyman, it is necessary to bow  also.    If a gentleman wishes to shake hands with a friend, he must lift  his hat with the left hand, leaving the right free to extend.  Never must he give his left hand, or extend a portion of the  right. The whole right hand is _en regle_.    A lady must recognize a gentleman, by bowing, before he is at  liberty to acknowledge an acquaintance with her. Should she bow,  he must lift his hat and bow also. If he is sufficiently barbarous  to have a cigar in his mouth, he must remove it while bowing to a  lady.    If a gentleman is walking with a lady, he should insist upon  carrying any book, parcel, or umbrella she may have with her.    No gentleman may smoke when walking with a lady. He should even  decline to do so though he may be asked to continue smoking.    Should a lady stop a gentleman to speak, she must make a slight  inclination of the head as a token of dismissal, and he must  accept it as such, bow, and leave her.    No lady will be guilty of the vulgarity of sucking the head of her  parasol in the street.    To eat anything, even confectionery, in the street, is a sign of  low breeding.    A gentleman must give a lady, an old gentleman, or clergyman with  whom he may be walking, the upper side (nearest the houses) of the  pavement.    If a gentleman meets a lady friend who is walking with any one he  does not know, he must not stop, nor must he stop if his companion  is unacquainted with a lady friend whom he may chance to meet. The  lady, however, has a perfect right to do as she likes. If she  should stop, the strangers must be introduced, and none of the  group should go on and wait, whether the introduction be agreeable  or not.    A lady should avoid walking very rapidly. It is very ungraceful  and unbecoming.    Swinging the arms is an awkward and ill-bred habit.    For a lady to run across the street, to avoid a carriage passing,  is not only ill-bred, but exceedingly dangerous.    To attempt to cross the street between the carriages of a funeral  procession is rude and disrespectful; and we cannot but commend  the foreign custom of removing the hat, and standing in a  respectful attitude until the melancholy train has passed.    When a gentleman is walking alone, he must always turn aside to  give the upper side of the pavement to a lady, to any one carrying  a heavy load, to a clergyman, or to an old gentleman.    Never push violently through a crowd. If a gentleman or lady is  really in haste, a few courteous words will open a passage more  quickly than the most vigorous pushing or shoving.    If a lady is caught in a shower, and a gentleman offers an  umbrella, she may accept it, if he is going in the same direction  as herself and accompanies her. If not, and he still insists,  etiquette requires the return of the umbrella as soon as the lady  reaches her destination. No lady may accept this courtesy from a  strange gentleman, but must decline it firmly, but politely.    Stopping to stare in the shop-windows is against the rules of  strict etiquette.    If a gentleman and lady are obliged to cross a narrow walk, plank,  or slippery place, the lady may go first, and the gentleman walk  close behind her, to aid her if needful. If the place is short,  then the gentleman should go first, and then offer his hand to  assist the lady across. If a gentleman meet a lady or old  gentleman at such a crossing, he may, with perfect propriety,  assist them in crossing, even if perfect strangers to him.    A gentleman must hold his hat in his hand if he stops to inquire  his own way, or to direct another.    If a gentleman sees a lady alone hesitating at a bad crossing, or  leaving a carriage at an awkward place, he may offer his hand to  assist her in crossing or alighting, raise his hat, bow, and pass  on. A lady may, with perfect propriety, accept such assistance  from a stranger, thanking him, and returning his bow.    If a lady leaves an omnibus or car alone, the gentleman nearest  the door should alight, assist her out, and enter the omnibus  again.    Gentlemen should always pass up the fare of ladies in an omnibus.

Then I heard another voice which sent the blood throbbing  through my heart: \"Piriou Louis, hunt the hounds well and spare neither  spur nor whip. Thou Raoul and thou Gaston, see that the _epervier_  does not prove himself _niais_, and if it be best in your judgment,  _faites courtoisie a l'oiseau. Jardiner un oiseau_, like the  _mue_ there on Hastur's wrist, is not difficult, but thou, Raoul,  mayest not find it so simple to govern that _hagard_. Twice last  week he foamed _au vif_ and lost the _beccade_ although he is  used to the _leurre_. The bird acts like a stupid _branchier.  Paitre un hagard n'est pas si facile.\"_    Was I dreaming? The old language of falconry which I had read in yellow  manuscripts--the old forgotten French of the middle ages was sounding in  my ears while the hounds bayed and the hawks' bells tinkled accompaniment  to the stamping horses. She spoke again in the sweet forgotten language:    \"If you would rather attach the _longe_ and leave thy _hagard au  bloc_, Raoul, I shall say nothing; for it were a pity to spoil so fair  a day's sport with an ill-trained _sors_. _Essimer abaisser_,--it is  possibly the best way. _Ca lui donnera des reins._ I was perhaps hasty  with the bird. It takes time to pass _a la filiere_ and the exercises  _d'escap_.\"    Then the falconer Raoul bowed in his stirrups and replied: \"If it be the  pleasure of Mademoiselle, I shall keep the hawk.\"    \"It is my wish,\" she answered. \"Falconry I know, but you have yet to give  me many a lesson in _Autourserie_, my poor Raoul. Sieur Piriou Louis  mount!\"    The huntsman sprang into an archway and in an instant returned, mounted  upon a strong black horse, followed by a piqueur also mounted.    \"Ah!\" she cried joyously, \"speed Glemarec Rene! speed! speed all! Sound  thy horn, Sieur Piriou!\"    The silvery music of the hunting-horn filled the courtyard, the hounds  sprang through the gateway and galloping hoof-beats plunged out of the  paved court; loud on the drawbridge, suddenly muffled, then lost in the  heather and bracken of the moors. Distant and more distant sounded the  horn, until it became so faint that the sudden carol of a soaring lark  drowned it in my ears. I heard the voice below responding to some call  from within the house.    \"I do not regret the chase, I will go another time Courtesy to the  stranger, Pelagie, remember!\"    And a feeble voice came quavering from within the house,  \"_Courtoisie_.\"    I stripped, and rubbed myself from head to foot in the huge earthen basin  of icy water which stood upon the stone floor at the foot of my bed. Then  I looked about for my clothes. They were gone, but on a settle near the  door lay a heap of garments which I inspected with astonishment. As my  clothes had vanished, I was compelled to attire myself in the costume  which had evidently been placed there for me to wear while my own clothes  dried. Everything was there, cap, shoes, and hunting doublet of silvery  grey homespun; but the close-fitting costume and seamless shoes belonged  to another century, and I remembered the strange costumes of the three  falconers in the court-yard. I was sure that it was not the modern dress  of any portion of France or Brittany; but not until I was dressed and  stood before a mirror between the windows did I realize that I was  clothed much more like a young huntsman of the middle ages than like a  Breton of that day. I hesitated and picked up the cap. Should I go down  and present myself in that strange guise? There seemed to be no help for  it, my own clothes were gone and there was no bell in the ancient chamber  to call a servant; so I contented myself with removing a short hawk's  feather from the cap, and, opening the door, went downstairs.    By the fireplace in the large room at the foot of the stairs an old  Breton woman sat spinning with a distaff. She looked up at me when I  appeared, and, smiling frankly, wished me health in the Breton language,  to which I laughingly replied in French. At the same moment my hostess  appeared and returned my salutation with a grace and dignity that sent a  thrill to my heart. Her lovely head with its dark curly hair was crowned  with a head-dress which set all doubts as to the epoch of my own costume  at rest. Her slender figure was exquisitely set off in the homespun  hunting-gown edged with silver, and on her gauntlet-covered wrist she  bore one of her petted hawks. With perfect simplicity she took my hand  and led me into the garden in the court, and seating herself before a  table invited me very sweetly to sit beside her. Then she asked me in her  soft quaint accent how I had passed the night, and whether I was very  much inconvenienced by wearing the clothes which old Pelagie had put  there for me while I slept. I looked at my own clothes and shoes, drying  in the sun by the garden-wall, and hated them. What horrors they were  compared with the graceful costume which I now wore! I told her this  laughing, but she agreed with me very seriously.    \"We will throw them away,\" she said in a quiet voice. In my astonishment  I attempted to explain that I not only could not think of accepting  clothes from anybody, although for all I knew it might be the custom of  hospitality in that part of the country, but that I should cut an  impossible figure if I returned to France clothed as I was then.    She laughed and tossed her pretty head, saying something in old French  which I did not understand, and then Pelagie trotted out with a tray on  which stood two bowls of milk, a loaf of white bread, fruit, a platter of  honey-comb, and a flagon of deep red wine. \"You see I have not yet broken  my fast because I wished you to eat with me. But I am very hungry,\" she  smiled.    \"I would rather die than forget one word of what you have said!\" I  blurted out, while my cheeks burned. \"She will think me mad,\" I added to  myself, but she turned to me with sparkling eyes.    \"Ah!\" she murmured. \"Then Monsieur knows all that there is of chivalry--\"    She crossed herself and broke bread. I sat and watched her white hands,  not daring to raise my eyes to hers.    \"Will you not eat?\" she asked. \"Why do you look so troubled?\"    Ah, why? I knew it now. I knew I would give my life to touch with my lips  those rosy palms--I understood now that from the moment when I looked  into her dark eyes there on the moor last night I had loved her. My great  and sudden passion held me speechless.    \"Are you ill at ease?\" she asked again.    Then, like a man who pronounces his own doom, I answered in a low voice:  \"Yes, I am ill at ease for love of you.\" And as she did not stir nor  answer, the same power moved my lips in spite of me and I said, \"I, who  am unworthy of the lightest of your thoughts, I who abuse hospitality and  repay your gentle courtesy with bold presumption, I love you.\"    She leaned her head upon her hands, and answered softly, \"I love you.  Your words are very dear to me. I love you.\"    \"Then I shall win you.\"    \"Win me,\" she replied.    But all the time I had been sitting silent, my face turned toward her.  She, also silent, her sweet face resting on her upturned palm, sat facing  me, and as her eyes looked into mine I knew that neither she nor I had  spoken human speech; but I knew that her soul had answered mine, and I  drew myself up feeling youth and joyous love coursing through every vein.  She, with a bright colour in her lovely face, seemed as one awakened from  a dream, and her eyes sought mine with a questioning glance which made me  tremble with delight. We broke our fast, speaking of ourselves. I told  her my name and she told me hers, the Demoiselle Jeanne d'Ys.    She spoke of her father and mother's death, and how the nineteen of her  years had been passed in the little fortified farm alone with her nurse  Pelagie, Glemarec Rene the piqueur, and the four falconers, Raoul,  Gaston, Hastur, and the Sieur Piriou Louis, who had served her father.  She had never been outside the moorland--never even had seen a human soul  before, except the falconers and Pelagie. She did not know how she had  heard of Kerselec; perhaps the falconers had spoken of it. She knew the  legends of Loup Garou and Jeanne la Flamme from her nurse Pelagie. She  embroidered and spun flax. Her hawks and hounds were her only  distraction. When she had met me there on the moor she had been so  frightened that she almost dropped at the sound of my voice. She had, it  was true, seen ships at sea from the cliffs, but as far as the eye could  reach the moors over which she galloped were destitute of any sign of  human life. There was a legend which old Pelagie told, how anybody once  lost in the unexplored moorland might never return, because the moors  were enchanted. She did not know whether it was true, she never had  thought about it until she met me. She did not know whether the falconers  had even been outside, or whether they could go if they would. The books  in the house which Pelagie, the nurse, had taught her to read were  hundreds of years old.    All this she told me with a sweet seriousness seldom seen in any one but  children. My own name she found easy to pronounce, and insisted, because  my first name was Philip, I must have French blood in me. She did not  seem curious to learn anything about the outside world, and I thought  perhaps she considered it had forfeited her interest and respect from the  stories of her nurse.    We were still sitting at the table, and she was throwing grapes to the  small field birds which came fearlessly to our very feet.    I began to speak in a vague way of going, but she would not hear of it,  and before I knew it I had promised to stay"]]]
