Kimball's Journal (#19)"],[1,"ham,  however, went to his trunk to get money to pay the bill and found we  had sufficient to pay our passage to Columbus, to which place we took  passage in the stage and tarried over night. When he paid the next  bill, he found he had sufficient means to pay our passage to Worcester,  and accordingly we took passage for that place. When we arrived there,  Brother Brigham went to his trunk again to get money to pay, and found  sufficient to pay our passage to Cleveland.    While on our way to Cleveland, and within about twenty miles of that  place we passed a little town called Strongsville. Brother Brigham had  a strong impression to stop at a tavern when we first came into that  town; but as the stage did not stop there we went on.    We arrived at Cleveland about eleven o'clock at night, took lodgings  and remained till next morning.    On the morning of November 3rd, it being Sunday, we went to the  Episcopalian church, and while returning to the hotel, we met my  father-in-law, and learned that Elders Smith, Turley and Hedlock had  just arrived in Cleveland. Father Murray was as much astonished to see  me alive as though he had seen one risen from the dead. I don't think I  ever saw a man feel better than he did when I met him in the street.    We walked with him a short distance and met the brethren, whose  health was good compared with what it had been, and who were in fine  spirits. We learned that they had stayed over night at the tavern  in Strongsville, where Brother Brigham had such a strong impression  to stop the night previous. They had picked up Elder John Taylor at  Dayton, where he was left at a tavern very sick with the ague a few  days before, by Father Coltrin, who proceeded to Kirtland.    Brothers Taylor and Hedlock got into the stage with us, which left  early in the afternoon, and rode as far as Willoughby. We proceeded  to Kirtland and arrived the same evening, where we found a good many  brethren and friends, who were glad to see us. Thus was the prediction  fulfilled which I made on my sick bed, in regard to reaching Kirtland  before my brethren.    Brother Brigham had one York shilling left, and on looking over our  expenses, we found we had paid out over eighty-seven dollars out of  the thirteen dollars and fifty cents we had at Pleasant Garden, which  was all the money we had to pay our passage with. We had traveled over  four hundred miles by stage, for which we paid from eight to ten cents  a mile, and had taken three meals a day, for each of which we were  charged fifty cents, also fifty cents for our lodgings. Brother Brigham  often suspected that I put the money in his trunk or clothes, thinking  that I had a purse of money which I had not acquainted him with; but  this was not so; the money could only have been put in his trunk by  some heavenly messenger, who thus administered to our necessities daily  as he knew we needed.    There was a division of sentiment among the brethren in Kirtland, many  of whom lacked the energy to move to Missouri, and some lacked the  disposition.    On Sunday, the 10th of November, Elder John Taylor preached in the  temple in the forenoon, and I preached in the afternoon. I had great  freedom in speaking, and compared my hearers to a parcel of old earthen  pots that were cracked in burning, for they were mostly apostates who  were living there.    Immediately after I returned to the house of Ira Bond, Martin Harris,  Cyrus Smalling and others came in and attacked me on what I had been  saying, asking me who I referred to in my comparisons. I answered, \"To  no one in particular, but to anyone that the coat fits.\" I was so sick  that I referred them to Brother Hedlock, who came in at that moment,  to talk with, as I was lying on a bed, having a chill, and not able  to talk. John Moreton and others declared I should never preach in  the house again. Some of the people tried to make me angry, so as to  quarrel with me, but they failed.    I made my home at Dean Gould's, in the house of Ira Bond. They were all  very kind to me. I staid with them most of the time I was in Kirtland,  during which the weather was very stormy.    I was thankful to get rid of the chills that time without the aid of  medicine, but I continued afflicted with a cough which I caught by  riding in the stage at night.    On Sunday, the 17th, Brother Brigham preached in the forenoon, and  Brother John Taylor in the afternoon. In the evening Brother Brigham  anointed Brother John Taylor in the house of the Lord, he having  previously washed himself in pure water; then we all went to the  temple. I was called upon and opened the meeting by prayer, when  Brigham anointed him with pure sweet oil and pronounced such blessings  upon him as the Spirit gave utterance to, and Brother Taylor then arose  and prayed.    Brother Theodore Turley, one of the Seventies, was then anointed by  Daniel S. Miles one of the presidents of the Seventies; both of which  anointings were sealed by loud shouts of hosannah. Then their feet were  washed and the meeting closed.    A council was held with Brothers Kellog, Moreton and others, who took  the lead in Kirtland. We proposed that some of the Elders should remain  there and preach for a few weeks, but John Moreton replied that they  had had many talented preachers, and he considered that men of such  ordinary ability as the missionaries of our party possessed could do no  good in Kirtland; he thought possibly that Brother John Taylor _might_  do, but he was not sure.    Kirtland at that time was a desolate looking place, about one-half of  the houses being empty and going to ruin.    We had but little means to prosecute our journey, but, God being our  helper, we felt to press our way onward.    I left there with my brethren on the 22nd of November, and went  to Fairport. There we were detained till the 26th on account of a  tremendous snow storm. Our board cost us fifteen dollars while there.  We boarded a boat and landed at Buffalo on the 27th, in the morning,  and proceeded by stage to Batavia, where we arrived in the evening. The  next afternoon, we took the cars for Rochester.    When we got to Byron, I got out and left the brethren, supposing Harvy  Hall, my brother-in-law, was living there. I had scarcely left the cars  when I was informed that he had gone to Rochester. I think I never felt  worse in my life, my anticipations were so great to see him, and I  could not get away till the next night. Just at evening, I got aboard  the cars and arrived at Hall's at eight the next evening, where I was  joyfully received. I staid there one week, and was confined to my bed  some of the time. I had to take deck passage on the steamboat for the  want of means, and took cold and it settled in my right side. I was so  bad that I could hardly draw my breath.    A letter from my wife reached Mendon, my old home about three weeks  before I did. Sister Hall was at my brother Solomon's, and advised him  to take it out. He did so, and opened it, but could not tell where I  was. Supposing that I was dead, my relatives were feeling very badly  when I arrived there. I was taken to my brother Solomon's, and he and  his family were all rejoiced to see me once more in the land of the  living.    Nathaniel Campbell, my wife's brother-in-law, came and took me home  with him to Victor. I received great kindness from them and from all my  old friends. Several of the neighbors came in while I was there, and  my wife's sister introduced me as her \"Mormon\" brother. They seemed  to take a great interest in our sufferings, and this seemed to be the  feeling of all candid people.    I was urged by my friends to return and bring my family, and remain  with them, or at least to stop there till warm weather, on account of  my poor health, as a little fatigue would bring me down again. However,  I knew it would not do, as \"no man, having put his hand to the plow,  and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\"    I preached in Mendon school house Sunday, December 21st, at one  o'clock. The house was full. Then in the evening again there was an  appointment for their Methodist preacher, but as he did not come,  nothing would do but I must preach. I also preached at Miller's Corner.  There seemed to be a great desire to hear, but my health would not  permit me to speak much.    On the 29th, Brother William E. Murray came through the snow up to  his horses' sides, determined to have me go home with him. It was as  much as we could do to get to his house. It was a pleasure to me to  see them. William said to me, \"When you want to pray, Heber, use your  liberty.\" He and his family seemed to take much pleasure in the things  of God; and on the first day of the year 1840, I went into the water  and baptized him and his wife. He gave me a little money, a pair of  pantaloons and a pair of drawers, and would have given me fifty dollars  if he had had it. My sister, Mrs. Wheeler, gave me another pair of  drawers and two fine shirts, and a shawl to wear around my neck. An old  friend, John E. Tomlinson, gave me a dollar and said if I would come  again he'd give me more. These, with Brother Wheeler, were the only  ones who would help me upon my mission. Others were willing to assist  me if I would only forsake my \"Mormonism\" and come back and live with  them; but I felt that I would rather live in a cave, or be driven with  the Saints every other year while I lived, and be one with them, than  to apostatize and have all the good things of the earth, for I would  feel myself disgraced in the sight of God and man.    On the 6th of January, I preached in Mendon for the fourth time. I also  had calls to preach in other parts of the town, as well as other towns  in that region. The Baptist church that I had formerly been a member  of, had about died out.    While in Victor, I had several calls to go to Pike. After being much  wrought upon, I consented to go. William Murray and wife"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/477"],[0,"Criminal Sociology (#19)"],[1,"long after they had admitted that  I was in the right, declared impulsively that ``the constant  commission of crime arises from the lack of timely repression,''  and that ``one of the chief causes of the growth of crime in Italy  is the mildness of our punishments.''  Or else they forgot to ask  themselves the elementary question of criminal sociology, whether  and how far punishments have a genuinely defensive force.  This is  just what happens with pedagogues who enter upon long discussions  on the various methods and means of <p 97>education, without  asking themselves beforehand whether and how far education has the  actual power of modifying the temperament and character which  heredity stamps upon every individual.    These conclusions take us far beyond the limit of penal severity,  and at the same time they suffice to combat the objection commonly  raised against those who think, like ourselves, that repressive  justice ought to concern itself not with the punishment of past  crime, but with the prevention of future crime.  For whilst the  advocates of severity, and those whom I will call the  ``laxativists,'' virtually think (apart from a few platonic  statements) only of punishments as remedies of offences, we on the  other hand believe that punishments are merely secondary  instruments of social self-defence, and remedies ought to be  adapted to the actual factors of the offence.  And since the  social factors are most capable of modification, so we say with  Prins that ``for social evils we require social cures.''    M. Tarde, then, was not quite accurate in his remark that my  conviction as to the very slight efficacy of punishments is a mere  consequence of my ideas on the anthropological and physical  character of crime, and that, ``on the contrary, the  preponderating importance which he has assigned to the social  causes logically debars him from accepting this conclusion.''  As  a matter of fact, punishment regarded as a psychological motive so  far as it is a legal deterrent, and as a physical motive so far as  it implies the confinement of the person condemned, would more  naturally belong, in abstract <p 98>logic, to the biological and  physical theory of crime.  Whereas it is precisely because I  recognise the influence of social environment, in addition, that  experimental logic convinces me that punishment is not an  efficacious remedy of crime, unless forces are applied beforehand  to neutralise, or at any rate to counteract, the social factors of  crime.    And if this is not a new conclusion, as one of our critics  observes by way of reproach--as though it were not one of the  characteristics of truth to repeat itself persistently, however  much it may be forgotten or even opposed--we must nevertheless  remark that it is now repeated with a mass of new observations and  definite applications, which give it a force unknown to mere  logical deductions.    The classical school has concerned itself simply with mitigation  of punishment as compared with medi<ae>val excess; and for this  reason, because every age has its own mission, it could not also  concern itself with the prevention of crimes, which is far more  useful and efficacious.  A few isolated thinkers, it is true,  wrote a few bold and far-reaching pages on preventive methods in  opposition to the numerous volumes on punishment; but their words  had no effect upon criminalists and legislators, because science  had not yet undertaken the positive and methodical observation of  the natural factors of crime.    I will confine myself to a few examples, in order to show that  amongst practical men, as amongst public officials and  legislators, the illusion that punishments are the true panacea of  crime is always predominant.  <p 99>    Practical men declare that ``the prohibitive penal law ought to be  regarded as the first and most important of preventive laws.''  The pr<e'>fets in their circulars, being concerned about the  increase of crime, put forward the most vigilant and severe  repression as a sovereign remedy.  A counsellor of the French Cour  de Cassation writes that ``in a worthy system of social police  there is no better guarantee for order and safety than  intimidation.''  The Keeper of the Seals, in his report on French  penal statistics for 1876, speaking of the continued increase of  indecent assaults, comes to the conclusion that ``in any case,  only firm and energetic repression can avail against a lamentable  increase of crimes against morality.''  And more recently another  Keeper of the Seals ended his report on the statistics of 1826 to  1880 by observing that ``the growth of crime can only be opposed  by an incessantly vigorous repression.''  M. Tarde agreed with  this conclusion, saying that ``if crimes are only, as has been  said, railway accidents of a society travelling at full speed, it  must not be forgotten that, the faster the train, the stronger  must be the brake . . . and it is certain that such a state of  affairs demands an increase or a new departure of repression and  punishment.''    It may be admitted that our conclusion is not a novelty; but, as  Stuart Mill said, there are two ways of effecting useful  innovations, to discover what was not known before, or else to  repeat with new demonstrations the truths which had been  forgotten.    And this illusion as to the influence of punishments <p 100>is so  widespread that it is well to inquire into its historic and  psychological arguments; for, as Spencer says, in order to decide  as to the value of an idea, it is useful to examine its genealogy.    We may pass by the foundation of primitive vengeance, which from  the age of private combats passed into the spirit and form of the  earliest penal laws, and still subsists as a more or less  unconscious and enfeebled residuum in modern society.  We may also  pass by the hereditary effect of the traditions of medi<ae>val  severity, which excite an instinctive sympathy for stern  punishment in connection with every crime.    But one of the main reasons of this tendency is an error of  psychological perspective, whereby men have forgotten the profound  differences of the ideas, habits, and sentiments of the various  social strata, concerning which I have spoken above.  Through this  forgetfulness the honest and instructed classes confound their own  idea of the penal law, and the impression it makes upon them, with  the idea and the impression of the social classes from which the  majority of criminals are recruited.  This has been remarked upon  by Beccaria, Carmignani, and Holtzendorff amongst the classical  criminalists, and by Lombroso and others of the new school who  have studied the slang and literature of criminals, which are  their psychological mirror.  Again, it is forgotten that for the  higher classes, apart from their physical and moral repugnance  against crime, which is the most powerful repelling force, there  is the fear of public opinion, almost unknown amongst the classes  which <p 101>have stopped short at a lower stage of human  evolution.    For the higher classes one example may suffice.  It is the fact  observed upon by Mr. Spencer, that gambling debts and Stock  Exchange bargains are scrupulously discharged, though for them  there is neither penal obligation nor evidence in writing.  And it  may be added that imprisonment for debt never promoted the  fulfilment of contracts, nor has its abolition discouraged it.    As for the lower classes, one visit to a prison suffices.  There,  if you ask a prisoner why the punishment did not deter him from  the crime, you generally get no answer, because he has never  thought about it.  Or else he replies, as I have often found, that  ``if you were afraid of hurting yourself when you went to work,  you would give up working.''  These indeed are what one would  expect to be the feelings prevailing amongst the lower social  strata, to whom honest sentiments and ideas, which for us are  traditional and organic, come very late--just as Mr. Stanley  observed that the people in Central Africa are only now beginning  to employ stone guns, which in past ages were used in Europe.    Another fallacy which helps to strengthen confidence in  punishments is that the effect of exceptional and summary laws is  treated on the same basis as that of the ordinary codes, slow and  uncertain in their procedure, which saps all their force by the  chance of immunity, and the interval between the unlawful act and  its legal consequence.    Lombroso and Tarde, indeed, have confronted me <p 102>with  historic examples of vigorous and even savage repressions, whereby  it was possible to stamp out some epidemic crime.  But these  examples are not conclusive, for I have shown that, as soon as  these exceptional repressions were at an end, as, for instance,  after the death of Pope Sixtus V., brigandage and other crimes  were persistently renewed.  But my main rejoinder is this, that  these exceptional repressions depend upon the _jus belli_; and  therefore cannot enter into the ordinary and constant methods of  penal administration.  This may not have the effect of an  extraordinary repression, secured by a somewhat unscrupulous  promptitude, which strikes innocent and guilty alike; and thus it  is impossible to treat as equal, or even to compare, the influence  of methods which are essentially different.    Another false comparison is drawn between the effective force of  various punishments, and their potentiality is confounded, whereas  it is necessary to distinguish the punishment of the written code  from that of the judge, and still more from that carried into  execution.  In fact it is only natural that punishment should more  or less terrify the criminal who has been judged and is about to  be condemned; but this in no way proves its efficacy, which should  have been displayed by the menace of the law in guarding the  prisoner against the crime.
