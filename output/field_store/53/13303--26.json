For example, through the  winter and spring of 1937 cotton factories in hundreds of cases  were running on a three-shift basis, piling up cotton goods in the  factory, and in the hands of middle men and retailers.  For example,  also, automobile manufacturers not only turned out a normal  increase of finished cars, but encouraged the normal increase to  run into abnormal figures, using every known method to push their  sales.  This meant, of course, that the steel mills of the nation  ran on a twenty-four hour basis, and the tire companies and cotton  factories and glass factories and others speeded up to meet the  same type of abnormally stimulated demand.  The buying power of the  nation lagged behind.    \"Thus by the autumn of 1937, last autumn, the nation again had  stocks on hand which the consuming public could not buy because the  purchasing power of the consuming public had not kept pace with the  production.    \"During the same period. . . the prices of many vital products had  risen faster than was warranted. . . .  In the case of many  commodities the price to the consumer was raised well above the  inflationary boom prices of 1929.  In many lines of goods and  materials, prices got so high that buyers and builders ceased to  buy or to build.    \". . .  The economic process of getting out the raw materials,  putting them through the manufacturing and finishing processes,  selling them to the retailers, selling them to the consumer, and  finally using them, got completely out of balance.    \". . .  The laying off of workers came upon us last autumn and has  been continuing at such a pace ever since that all of us,  government and banking and business and workers, and those faced  with destitution, recognize the need for action.\"    All of this I said to the Congress today and I repeat it to you,  the people of the country tonight.    I went on to point out to the Senate and the House of  Representatives that all the energies of government and business  must be directed to increasing the national income, to putting more  people into private jobs, to giving security and a feeling of  security to all people in all walks of life.    I am constantly thinking of all our people--unemployed and employed  alike--of their human problems of food and clothing and homes and  education and health and old age.  You and I agree that security is  our greatest need; the chance to work, the opportunity of making a  reasonable profit in our business--whether it be a very small  business or a larger one--the possibility of selling our farm  products for enough money for our families to live on decently.  I  know these are the things that decide the well-being of all our  people.    Therefore, I am determined to do all in my power to help you attain  that security and because I know that the people themselves have a  deep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind cannot be a  lasting one except on a basis of business fair dealing and a basis  where all from the top to the bottom share in the prosperity.  I  repeated to the Congress today that neither it nor the Chief  Executive can afford \"to weaken or destroy great reforms which,  during the past five years, have been effected on behalf of the  American people.  In our rehabilitation of the banking structure and  of agriculture, in our provisions for adequate and cheaper credit  for all types of business, in our acceptance of national  responsibility for unemployment relief, in our strengthening of the  credit of state and local government, in our encouragement of  housing, and slum clearance and home ownership, in our supervision  of stock exchanges and public utility holding companies and the  issuance of new securities, in our provision for social security,  the electorate of America wants no backward steps taken.    \"We have recognized the right of labor to free organization, to  collective bargaining; and machinery for the handling of labor  relations is now in existence.  The principles are established even  though we can all admit that, through the evolution of time,  administration and practices can be improved.  Such improvement can  come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere efforts  to understand and assist on the part of labor leaders and employers  alike.    \"The never-ceasing evolution of human society will doubtless bring  forth new problems which will require new adjustments.  Our  immediate task is to consolidate and maintain the gains achieved.    \"In this situation there is no reason and no occasion for any  American to allow his fears to be aroused or his energy and  enterprise to be paralyzed by doubt or uncertainty.\"    I came to the conclusion that the present-day problem calls for  action both by the government and by the people, that we suffer  primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of  buying power.  Therefore it is up to us to create an economic  upturn.    \"How and where can and should the government help to start an  upward spiral?\"    I went on in my message today to propose three groups of measures  and I will summarize my recommendations.    First, I asked for certain appropriations which are intended to  keep the government expenditures for work relief and similar  purposes during the coming fiscal year at the same rate of  expenditure as at present.  That includes additional money for the  Works Progress Administration; additional funds for the Farm  Security Administration; additional allotments for the national  Youth Administration, and more money for the Civilian Conservation  Corps, in order that it can maintain the existing number of camps  now in operation.    These appropriations, made necessary by increased unemployment,  will cost about a billion and a quarter dollars more than the  estimates which I sent to the Congress on the third of January .    Second, I told the Congress that the administration proposes to  make additional bank reserves available for the credit needs of the  country.  About one billion four hundred million dollars of gold now  in the treasury will be used to pay these additional expenses of  the government, and three-quarters of a billion dollars of  additional credit will be made available to the banks by reducing  the reserves now required by the Federal Reserve Board.    These two steps--taking care of relief needs and adding to bank  credits--are in our best judgment insufficient by themselves to  start the nation on a sustained upward movement.    Therefore, I came to the third kind of government action which I  consider to be vital.  I said to the Congress:    \"You and I cannot afford to equip ourselves with two rounds of  ammunition where three rounds are necessary.  If we stop at relief  and credit, we may find ourselves without ammunition before the  enemy is routed.  If we are fully equipped with the third round of  ammunition, we stand to win the battle against adversity.\"    This third proposal is to make definite additions to the purchasing  power of the nation by providing new work over and above the  continuing of the old work.    First, to enable the United States Housing Authority to undertake  the immediate construction of about three hundred million dollars  of additional slum clearance projects.    Second, to renew a public works program by starting as quickly as  possible about one billion dollars worth of needed permanent public  improvements in our states, and their counties and cities.    Third, to add one hundred million dollars to the estimate for  federal aid highways in excess of the amount I recommended in  January.    Fourth, to add thirty-seven million dollars over and above the  former estimate of sixty-three million for flood control and  reclamation.    Fifth, to add twenty-five million dollars additional for federal  buildings in various parts of the country.    In recommending this program I am thinking not only of the  immediate economic needs of the people of the nation, but also of  their personal liberties--the most precious possession of all  Americans.  I am thinking of our democracy and of the recent trend  in other parts of the world away from the democratic ideal.    Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations--  disappeared not because the people of those nations disliked  democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and  insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless  in the face of government confusion and government weakness through  lack of leadership in government.  Finally, in desperation, they  chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat.  We in America know that our own democratic institutions can be  preserved and made to work.  But in order to preserve them we need  to act together, to meet the problems of the nation boldly, and to  prove that the practical operation of democratic government is  equal to the task of protecting the security of the people.    Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of  our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our  government to give employment to idle men.  The people of America  are in agreement in defending their liberties at any cost, and the  first line of that defense lies in the protection of economic  security.  Your government, seeking to protect democracy, must prove  that government is stronger than the forces of business depression.    History proves that dictatorships do not grow out of strong and  successful governments but out of weak and helpless governments.  If  by democratic methods people get a government strong enough to  protect them from fear and starvation, their democracy succeeds,  but if they do not, they grow impatient.  Therefore, the only sure  bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to  protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and  well enough informed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#19)"],[1,"in English and the Rover boys recognized  Dan Baxter.    \"Silence, on your life!\" cried Tom.    \"Tom Rover!\" gasped the bully.  \"How came you--\"    \"Silence, Baxter!  I have a pistol and you know I am a good shot.  Stand where you an and put both hands over your head.\"    \"Will I stand?  Not much!\" yelled the bully, and flung his torch  straight at Tom.  Then he turned and ran for the fort, giving the  alarm at the top of his lungs.    The torch struck Tom on the neck, and for the moment the youth was  in danger of losing his hold on the vines and tumbling to the  jagged rocks below.  But then the torch slipped away, past Sam and  Aleck, and went hissing into the dark waters of the Congo.    By this time Cujo had reached the top of the cliff and was making  after Baxter.  Both gained the end of the fort at the same time and  one mighty blow from Cujo's club laid Baxter senseless near the  doorway.    \"Help!  help!\"  The cry came in Dick's voice, and was plainly  heard by Sam and Tom.  Then Captain Villaire appeared, and a rough  and tumble battle ensued, which the Rovers well remember to this  day.    But Tom was equal to the occasion, and after the first onslaught  he turned, as if summoning help from the cliff.  \"This way!\" he  cried.  \"Tell the company to come up here and the other company  can surround the swamp!\"    Several pistol shots rang out, and the boys saw a Frenchman go  down with a broken arm.  Then Captain Villaire shouted: \"We have  been betrayed--we must flee!\"  The cry came in French, and as if  by magic the brigands disappeared into the woods behind the old  fort; and victory was upon the side of our friends.          CHAPTER XXI    INTO THE HEART OF AFRICA      \"Well, I sincerely trust we have no more such adventures.\"    The speaker was Randolph Rover.  He was seated on an old bench in  one of the rooms of the fort, binding up a finger which had been  bruised in the fray.  It was two hours later, and the fight had  come to an end some time previous.  Nobody was seriously hurt,  although Sam, Dick, and Aleck were suffering from several small  wounds.  Aleck had had his ear clipped by a bullet from Captain  Villaire's pistol and was thankful that he had not been killed.    Baxter, the picture of misery, was a prisoner.  The bully's face  was much swollen and one eye was in deep mourning.  He sat huddled  up in a heap in a corner and wondering what punishment would be  dealt out to him.  \"I suppose they'll kill me,\" he groaned, and it  may be added that he thought he almost deserved that fate.    \"You came just in time,\" said Dick.  \"Captain Villaire was about  to torture us into writing letters home asking for the money he  wanted as a ransom.  Baxter put it into his head that we were very  rich.\"    \"Oh, please don't say anything more about it!\" groaned the  unfortunate bully.  \"I--that Frenchman put up this job all on  his own hook.\"    \"I don't believe it,\" came promptly from Randolph Rover.  \"You met  him, at Boma; you cannot deny it.\"    \"So I did; but he didn't say he was going to capture you, and I--\"    \"We don't care to listen to your falsehoods, Baxter,\" interrupted  Dick sternly.    \"You are fully as guilty as anybody. You admitted it before.\"    Cujo had gone off to watch Captain Villaire and his party.  He now  came back, bringing word that the brigand had taken a fallen tree  and put out on the Congo and was drifting down the stream along  with several of his companions in crime.    \"Him won't come back,\" said the tall African.  \"Him had enough of  urn fight.\"    Nevertheless the whole party remained on guard until morning,  their weapons ready for instant use.  But no alarm came, and when  day, dawned they soon made sure that they had the entire locality  around the old fort to themselves, the Frenchman with a broken arm  having managed to crawl off and reach his friends.    What to do with Dan Baxter was a conundrum.    \"We can't take him with us, and if we leave him behind he will  only be up to more evil,\" said Dick.  \"We ought to turn him over  to the British authorities.\"    \"No, no, don't do that,\" pleaded the tall youth.  \"Let me go and  I'll promise never to interfere with you again.\"    \"Your promises are not worth the breath used in uttering them,\"  replied Tom.  \"Baxter, a worse rascal than you could not be  imagined.  Why don't you try to turn over a new leaf?\"    \"I will--if you'll only give me one more chance,\" pleaded the  former bully of Putnam Hall.    The matter was discussed in private and it was at last decided to  let Baxter go, providing he would, promise to return straight to  the coast.    \"And remember,\" said Dick, \"if we catch you following us again we  will shoot you on sight.\"    \"I won't follow--don't be alarmed,\" was the low answer, and then  Baxter was released and conducted to the road running down to  Boma.  He was given the knife he had carried, but the Rovers kept  his pistol, that he might not be able to take a long-range shot at  them.  Soon he was out of their sight, not to turn up again for a  long while to come.    It was not until the heat of the day had been spent that the  expedition resumed its journey, after, an excellent meal made from  the supplies Captain Villaire's party had left behind in their  hurried flight.  Some of the remaining supplies were done up into  bundles by Cujo, to replace those which had been lost when the  natives hired by Randolph Rover had deserted.    \"It's queer we didn't see anything of that man and woman from the  inn,\" remarked Dick, as they set off.  \"I reckon they got scared  at the very start.\"    They journeyed until long after nightfall, \"To make up for lost  time,\" as Mr. Rover expressed it, and so steadily did Cujo push on  that when a halt was called the boys were glad enough to rest.  They had reached a native village called Rowimu.  Here Cujo was  well known and he readily procured good accommodations for all  hands.    The next week passed without special incident, excepting that one  afternoon the whole party went hunting, bringing down a large  quantity of birds, and several small animals, including an  antelope, which to the boys looked like a Maine deer excepting for  the peculiar formation of its horns.    \"I wonder how Mr. Blaze is making out?\" said Tom, when they were  returning to camp from the hunt.    \"Oh, I reckon he is blasting away at game,\" laughed Sam, and Tom  at once groaned over the attempted joke.    \"Perhaps we will meet him some day--if he's in this territory,\"  put in Dick.  \"But just now I am looking for nobody but father.\"    \"And so are all of us,\" said Tom and Sam promptly.    They were getting deeper and deeper into the jungle and had to  take good care that they did not become separated.  Yet Cujo said  he understood the way perfectly and often proved his words by  mentioning something which they would soon reach, a stream, a  little lake, or a series of rocks with a tiny waterfall.    \"Been ober dis ground many times,\" said the guide.    \"I suppose this is the ground Stanley covered in his famous  expedition along the Congo,\" remarked Dick, as they journeyed  along.  \"But who really discovered the country, Uncle Randolph?\"    \"That is a difficult question to answer, Dick.  The Portuguese,  the Spanish, and the French all claim that honor, along with the  English.  I fancy different sections, were discovered by different  nationalities.  This Free State, you know, is controlled by half a  dozen nations.\"    \"I wonder if the country will ever be thoroughly civilized?\"    \"It will take a long while, I am afraid.  Christianity will have  to come first.  Many of the tribes in Africa are, you must  remember, without any form of religion whatever, being even worse  than what we call heathens, who worship some sort of a God.\"    \"Don't they believe in anything?\" asked Sam.    \"Nothing, Sam.  And their morality is of the lowest grade in  consequence.  They murder and steal whenever the chance offers,  and when they think the little children too much care for them  they pitch them into the rivers for the crocodiles to feed upon.\"    \"The beasts!\" murmured Tom.  \"Well, I reckon at that rate,  civilization can't come too quick, even if it has to advance  behind bayonets and cannon.\"          CHAPTER XXII    A HURRICANE IN THE JUNGLE      On and on went the expedition.  In the past many small towns and  villages had been visited where there were more or less white  people; but now they reached a territory where the blacks held  full sway, with--but this was rarely--a Christian missionary  among them.    At all of the places which were visited Cujo inquired about King  Susko and his people, and at last learned that the African had  passed to the southeast along the Kassai River, driving before him  several hundred head of cattle which he had picked up here and  there.    \"Him steal dat cattle,\" explained Cujo, \"but him don't say dat  stealin', him say um--um--\"    \"A tax on the people?\" suggested Dick.    \"Yes, um tax.  But him big Vief.\"    \"He must be, unless he gives the people some benefit for the tax  they are forced to pay,\" said Tom.    At one of the villages they leaned that there was another  American Party in that territory, one sent out by an Eastern  college to collect specimens of the flora of central Africa.  It  was said that the party consisted of an elderly man and half a  dozen young fellows.    \"I wouldn't mind meeting that crowd,\" said Sam.  \"They might  brighten up things a bit.\"    \"Never mind; things will pick up when once we meet King Susko,\"  said Dick.  \"But I would like to know where the crowd is from and  who is in it.\"    \"It's not likely we would know them if they are from the East,\"  said Sam.  \"Probably they hail from Yale or Harvard.\"    Two days later the storm which Cujo had predicted for some time  caught them while they were in the midst of an immense forest of  teak and rosewood.  It was the middle of the afternoon, yet the  sky became"]]]
