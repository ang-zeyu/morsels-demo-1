On Sunday morning, the 29th September, having hobbled my horses so  short, although the scrubs were so thick, they were actually in sight  at dawn; I might as well have tied them up. Starting at once, I  travelled to one or two hills we had passed by, but had not inspected  before. I could find no water anywhere. It was late when I reached the  camp, and I was gladdened to find the party still there, and that the  water supply had held out so long. On the following morning, Monday,  the 30th of September, it was at a very low ebb; the trickling had  ceased in the upper holes, though it was still oozing into the lower  ones, so that it was absolutely necessary to pack up and be off from  this wretched place. It was an expedition in itself to get water for  the camp, from the rock basins above. The horses dreaded to approach  it on account of their tender feet. It required a lot of labour to get  sufficient firewood to boil a quart pot, for, although we were camped  in a dense thicket, the small wood of which it was composed was all  green, and useless for firewood.    I intended to retreat from here to-day, but just as Robinson was  starting to find the horses a shower of rain came on, and hoping it  might end in a heavier fall, I decided to remain until to-morrow, to  give the rain a chance,--especially as, aided by the slight rain, the  horses could do without a drink, there now being only one drink  remaining, as the trickling had entirely ceased, though we yet had the  little holes full. The rain fell in a slight and gentle shower two or  three hours, but it left no trace of its fall, even upon the rocks, so  that our water supply was not increased by one pint.    To-morrow I am off; it is useless to remain in a region such as this.  But where shall I go next? The creek I had last got water in, might  even now be dry. I determined to try and reach it farther down its  channel. If it existed beyond where I left it, I expected, in  twenty-five to thirty miles, in a southerly direction, to strike it  again: therefore, I decided to travel in that direction. A few  quandongs, or native peach trees, exist amongst these gullies; also a  tree that I only know by the name of the corkwood tree. (\"Sesbania  grandiflora,\" Baron Mueller says, \"North-Western Australia; to the  verge of the tropics; Indian Archipelago; called in Australia the  corkwood tree; valuable for various utilitarian purposes. The  red-flowered variety is grandly ornamented. Dr. Roxburgh recommends  the leaves and young pods as an exquisite spinach; the plant is shy of  frost.\") The wood is soft, and light in weight and colour. It is by no  means a handsome tree. It grows about twenty feet high. Generally two  or three are huddled together, as though growing from one stem. Those  I saw were nearly all dead. They grow in the little water channels.  The ants here, as in nearly the whole of Tropical Australia, build  nests from four to six feet high--in some other parts I have known  them twenty--to escape, I suppose, from the torrents of rain that at  times fall in these regions: the height also protects their eggs and  stores from the fires the natives continually keep burning. This  burning, perhaps, accounts for the conspicuous absence of insects and  reptiles. One night, however, I certainly saw glowworms. These I have  only seen in one other region in Australia--near Geelong, in Victoria.  A tree called the native poplar (Codonocarpus cotinifolius) is also  found growing in the scrubs and water-channels of this part of the  country. The climate of this region appears very peculiar. Scarcely a  week passes without thunderstorms and rain; but the latter falls in  such small quantities that it is almost useless. It is evidently on  this account that there are no waters or watercourses deserving of the  name. I should like to know how much rain would have to fall here  before any could be discovered lying on the ground. All waters found  in this part of the country must be got out of pure sand, in a water  channel or pure rock. The native orange-tree grows here, but the  specimens I have met are very poor and stunted. The blood-wood-trees,  or red gum-trees, which always enliven any landscape where they are  found, also occur. They are not, however, the magnificent vegetable  structures which are known in Queensland and Western Australia, but  are mostly gnarled and stunted. They also grow near the watercourses.    The 1st October broke bright and clear, and I was only too thankful to  get out of this horrible region and this frightful encampment, into  which the fates had drawn me, alive. When the horses arrived, there  was only just enough water for all to drink; but one mare was away,  and Robinson said she had foaled. The foal was too young to walk or  move; the dam was extremely poor, and had been losing condition for  some time previously; so Robinson went back, killed the foal, and  brought up the mare. Now there was not sufficient water to satisfy her  when she did come. Mr. Carmichael and I packed up the horses, while  Robinson was away upon his unpleasant mission. When he brought her up,  the mare looked the picture of misery. At last I turned my back upon  this wretched camp and region; and we went away to the south. It was  half-past two o'clock when we got clear from our prison.    It is almost a work of supererogation to make many further remarks on  the character of this region--I mean, of course, since we left the  Finke. I might, at a word, condemn it as a useless desert. I will,  however, scarcely use so sweeping a term. I can truly say it is dry,  stony, scrubby, and barren, and this in my former remarks any one who  runs can read. I saw very few living creatures, but it is occasionally  visited by its native owners, to whom I do not grudge the possession  of it. Occasionally the howls of the native dog (Canis familiaris)--or  dingo as he is usually called--were heard, and their footprints in  sandy places seen. A small species of kangaroo, known as the scrub  wallaby, were sometimes seen, and startled from their pursuit of  nibbling at the roots of plants, upon which they exist; but the scrubs  being so dense, and their movements so rapid, it was utterly  impossible to get a shot at them. Their greatest enemy--besides the  wild black man and the dingo--is the large eagle-hawk, which, though  flying at an enormous height, is always on the watch; but it is only  when the wallaby lets itself out, on to the stony open, that the enemy  can swoop down upon it. The eagle trusses it with his talons, smashes  its head with its beak to quiet it, and, finally, if a female, flies  away with the victim to its nest for food for its young, or if a male  bird, to some lonely rock or secluded tarn, to gorge its fill alone. I  have frequently seen these eagles swoop on to one, and, while  struggling with its prey, have galloped up and secured it myself,  before the dazed wallaby could collect its senses. Other birds of  prey, such as sparrow-hawks, owls, and mopokes (a kind of owl),  inhabit this region, but they are not numerous. Dull-coloured, small  birds, that exist entirely without water, are found in the scrubs; and  in the mornings they are sometimes noisy, but not melodious, when  there is a likelihood of rain; and the smallest of Australian  ornithology, the diamond bird (Amadina) of Gould, is met with at  almost every watering place. Reptiles and insects, as I have said, are  scarce, on account of the continual fires the natives use in their  perpetual hunt for food.      CHAPTER 1.5. FROM 1ST TO 15TH OCTOBER, 1872.

On starting from Mount Udor, on the 1st October, our road lay at first  over rocks and stones, then for two or three miles through thick  scrubs. The country afterwards became a trifle less scrubby, and  consisted of sandhills, timbered with casuarina, and covered, as  usual, with triodia. In ten miles we passed a low bluff hill, and  camped near it, without any water. On the road we saw several quandong  trees, and got some of the ripe fruit. The day was warm and sultry;  but the night set in cool, if not cold. Mr. Carmichael went to the top  of the low bluff, and informed me of the existence of low ridges,  bounding the horizon in every direction except to the  south-south-east, and that the intervening country appeared to be  composed of sandhills, with casuarinas, or mulga scrubs.    In Baron von Mueller's extraordinary work on Select Extra-tropical  Plants, with indications of their native countries, and some of their  uses, these remarks occur:--\"Acac"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#19)"],[1,"illness, my readers will understand that my statements as to the  ingratitude of those who benefit by the prospectors' toil are not  unfounded. Unfortunately for me, my old mate, Lord Douglas, was absent  in England, and, in consequence, much misunderstanding resulted between  the syndicate and myself.          CHAPTER VII        SALE OF MINE      During my convalescence in Perth, I occupied my time by drawing in the  Government offices, a map, compiled from the various notes and journals I  had kept during the prospecting expeditions in which I had been engaged.  I also took the opportunity of getting some knowledge of astronomical  subjects, likely to be of service in the more extended expedition I had  in my mind. My thanks are due to Mr. Barlee, chief draughtsman, and  Mr. Higgins, of the Mines Department, for the kindness they showed in  helping me in this work.    It was not very long before I felt it was necessary to return to my  duties at Lake Darlot. Timing my arrival in Coolgardie to coincide with  that of Mr. Wilson from the mine, we met; and from him I was pleased to  hear how well the claim was turning out.    Since it was not necessary for both of us to be on the spot, I took one of  the camels, of which we now had five, and made all speed to a reported  \"new rush\" near Lake Lefroy, that was causing much excitement. Knots of  men could be seen in every corner of the town eagerly discussing the news;  gold, to the tune of 30,000 ounces, was being brought in; was in the town;  was actually in one of the banks! Many had seen it (or said so). Where was  this Eldorado? Every man knew; every man had directions how to get there,  from quite unimpeachable sources. It was actually in the local papers;  indeed, there could be no doubt about it. I knew of course that all this  must be discounted, but the matter was worth looking into, and I was  fortunate to get THE very latest information from one who was an old  mate of the supposed lucky digger. I found my travelling companion had  equally well authenticated information. On comparing notes we soon  discovered that our directions were entirely at variance.    To make a long story short, we at length found that, like hundreds of  others, we had been fooled, and that the whole thing was bogus. The  diggers' indignation was righteously intense, the office of the offending  newspaper was attacked, and much damage narrowly averted. One unfortunate  man, on whom fell the wrath of the crowd, returning from the supposed  rush, lied profusely when \"in drink,\" said that he had found the spot,  that hundreds of men were gleaning rich gold in fabulous quantities, that  the world had never seen so wonderful a find, that gold would soon be as  cheap as lead in the market--in fact told a thousand and one similar fairy  tales, engendered by whisky and excitement. When sober he foolishly stuck  to what he had said; and, in consequence, was sent by the diggers, under  escort, to point out the spot, which of course he could not find. His  reception in Coolgardie may be imagined! Doubtless on the Western  goldfields of America, \"lynching\" would have been his portion. Even in  order-loving Australia he might have had an unpleasant time, had not  Mr. Finnerty, the popular Warden, quelled the turmoil, and placed the  offender under Police protection. For want of the real article, a  well-attended procession burnt this idiot's effigy, and thus the great  rush ended.    It was supposed by some, if I remember rightly, that the fire which gutted  nearly half the town had its origin in this effigy-burning. What a blaze  that was to be sure! Tents, shanties, houses of hessian, shops of  corrugated iron and wood, offices, hotels, and banks, consumed in one  sheet of flame in a matter of half an hour or so, the blaze accompanied by  explosions of dynamite caps, kerosene, and cartridges. Nothing could be  done to stay its fury. To save the town, houses were demolished, to form  wide gaps across which the flames could not reach. It was the general  impression that corrugated iron was more or less fireproof. However, it  burnt like cardboard. Ruinous to some as the early fires were, they  benefited the general community, as more substantial buildings were  erected, and hessian shanties forbidden.    After a good deal of unpleasant business over the mine at Lake Darlot,  which the syndicate wished to abandon, for reasons best known to  themselves, I was at length on the road for that district, with the  agreeable news that our mine was for sale, and would soon be off our  hands.    I had a rather more enjoyable journey than my previous one, for not only  was I free from fever, and the mine in a fair way to being sold, but  winter had changed the face of the bush from dull dead yellow to bright  smiling green, dotted here and there with patches of white and pink  everlastings. One could hardly believe it was the same country. Instead of  the intense heat a bright warm sun dissipated the keen and frosty air of  early morning, while the hoar-frost at night made one glad of a good  possum rug to coil oneself up in. I did not envy the cyclists, for  sometimes, failing to hit off a camp on the road, they had perforce to  make the best of a fire as a substitute for a blanket, and to be content  with a hungry stomach, in place of having a meal.    Before the erection of telegraph wires, which now connect all the more  important mining towns, cyclists made good money by carrying special  messages from Coolgardie to the outlying districts. Except where the sand  was deep they had a good track, well-beaten by the flat pads of camels,  and could do their hundred miles a day at a push. Travelling at express  rate, they were unable to carry blankets or provisions except of the  scantiest description, and took their chance of hitting off the camp of  some wayfarer, who would always be ready to show what hospitality he  could, to messengers of so much importance. To have to part with one of  your blankets on a cold night for the benefit of another traveller, is  one of the severest exercises of self denial.    These little kindly services are always rendered, for a man in the bush  who would not show courtesy and hospitality to a fellow-wayfarer is  rightly considered a cur. No matter what time one strikes a man's camp,  his first thought, whether for stranger or friend, is to put on the  \"billy\" and make a pot of tea.    Arrived at Lake Darlot, I found work being carried on well and with  energy, as could not fail to be the case where Dave Wilson was concerned.  Poor Jim and Paddy had had hard times, before Wilson arrived, to make the  provisions last out. Nevertheless they had worked away on the reef without  complaint, while others around them were waxing rich on the alluvial.    The population had increased to some two thousand men during my absence:  two thousand men working and living in order and peace, with no police or  officials of any kind within two hundred miles--a state of affairs of  which we may justly be proud.    Evil-doing, however, was not entirely absent, and occasional cases of  robbery of gold, or pilfering of tents occurred; the offenders in such  cases were usually caught and summarily dealt with.    A \"roll up\" would be called, and those who cared to put themselves  forward, would form judge, jury, police, and all. The general verdict was  notice to quit within so many hours--an order that few would dare to  neglect. A case in which this did happen occurred at Kurnalpi when a man  was caught passing bad notes in the \"Sunday School.\" He refused to budge,  and, seeing that he was a great giant with the reputation of being the  roughest and hardest fighter in the country, the question arose who should  \"bell the cat.\" The man who had been swindled was a stranger, and  unwilling to fight his own battle; who, therefore, would volunteer to get  a sound hammering from one of the toughest blackguards in Australia.    The \"roll up\" slowly dispersed, every man muttering that it was not his  business, and that, after all, passing a \"stiff 'un\" on to a new chum was  no great crime as compared to stealing gold or robbing a camp. In this I  think they showed sound judgment. The prize-fighting gent, however, became  too bumptious, and was eventually hustled out of the place.    Our camp at Lake Darlot was rather pleasantly situated on rising ground by  the side of the blow; behind us, sheer cliffs of conglomerate, worn and  weathered into queer little caves, the floors of which were covered inches  deep by the droppings of bats and small wallabies; and, stretching away  to the South, an open plain enclosed in an endless sea of scrub. Every  morning we witnessed the strange phenomenon of a lake appearing in the sky  to the South, miles away, above the scrub, a lake surrounded by steep  white cliffs. This mirage would last perhaps half an hour, and was, I  suppose, a reflection of Lake Darlot, which lay at the back of us, some  five miles distant to the North.    Our camp consisted of the usual tents and bough-shades and for the first,  and probably the only, time in our lives we cooked our pots on a golden  fireplace. To protect the fire from the wind, so that a good pile of ashes  should collect for baking purposes, we had made a semicircular wall of  stones. The nearest available stones, quartz boulders from the blow, were  used, and so it came about that we had a gold-studded fireplace! We used  to have a curious visitor from the caves--a small black cat, which was  tame enough to wander between our legs as we sat round the fire, but too  wary to be caught. I can hardly imagine a prospector carrying a cat as  companion, and yet how else did it get there? Its shyness inclined us to  think it had strayed from civilisation. Jim tried to catch it one evening,  and not only got scratched and bitten for his trouble, but so startled the  beast that it never returned. Our party was now increased "]]]
