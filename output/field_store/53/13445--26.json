Experience has taught us that the nature of our food is not a matter of  indifference to the respiratory organs. Diseased lungs are exasperated  by a certain diet, and pacified by one of an opposite kind. The  celebrated diver, Mr. Spalding, observed, that whenever he used a diet  of animal food, or drank spirituous liquors, he consumed in a much  shorter period the oxygen of the atmospheric air in his diving-bell; and  he therefore, on such occasions, confined himself to vegetable diet. He  also found the same effect to arise from the use of fermented liquors,  and he accordingly restricted himself to the potation of simple water.  The truth of these results is confirmed by the habits of the Indian  pearl-divers, who always abstain from every alimentary stimulus previous  to their descent into the ocean.--_Dr. Paris on Diet._           *       *       *       *       *        THE MONTHS      The season has now advanced to full maturity. The corn is yielding to  the sickle, the husbandmen,        \"By whose tough labours, and rough hands,\"    our barns are stored with grain, are at their toils, and when nature is  despoiled of her riches and beauty, will, with glad and joyous heart,  celebrate the annual festival of      THE HARVEST HOME.    BY CORNELIUS WEBBE.          Hark! the ripe and hoary rye      Waving white and billowy,      Gives a husky rustle, as      Fitful breezes fluttering pass.      See the brown and bending wheat,      By its posture seems to meet      The harvest's sickle, as it gleams      Like the crescent moon in streams,      Brown with shade and night that run      Under shores and forests dun.        Lusty Labour, with tired stoop,      Levels low, at every swoop,      Armfuls of ripe-coloured corn,      Yellow as the hair of morn;      And his helpers track him close,      Laying it in even rows,      On the furrow's stubbly ridge;      Nearer to the poppied hedge.      Some who tend on him that reaps      Fastest, pile it into heaps;      And the little gleaners follow      Them again, with whoop and halloo      When they find a hand of ears      More than falls to their compeers.        Ripening in the dog-star's ray,      Some, too early mown, doth lay;      Some in graceful shocks doth stand      Nodding farewell to the land      That did give it life and birth;      Some is borne, with shout and mirth,      Drooping o'er the groaning wain.      Through the deep embowered lane;      And the happy cottaged poor,      Hail it, as it glooms their door,      With a glad, unselfish cry,      Though they'll buy it bitterly.        And the old are in the sun,      Seeing that the work is done      As it was when age was young;      And the harvest song is sung;      And the quaint and jocund tale      Takes the stint-key from the ale,      And as free and fast it runs      As a June rill from the sun's      Dry and ever-drinking mouth:--      Mirth doth alway feel a drowth.      Butt and barrel ceaseless flow      Fast as cans can come and go;      One with emptied measures comes      Drumming them with tuneful thumbs;      One reels field-ward, not quite sober,      With two cans of ripe October,      Some of last year's brewing, kept      Till the corn of this is reaped.        Now 'tis eve, and done all labour,      And to merry pipe and tabor,      Or to some cracked viol strummed      With vile skill, or table drummed      To the tune of some brisk measure,      Wont to stir the pulse to pleasure,      Men and maidens timely beat      The ringing ground with frolic feet;      And the laugh and jest go round      Till all mirth in noise is drowned.    _Literary Souvenir_.           *       *       *       *       *      ARMORIAL BEARINGS AT CROYDON PALACE.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)      Sir,--In No. 266 of the Mirror, _Sagittarius_ wishes to know the name of  the person whose armorial bearings are emblazoned at Croydon palace.    From the blazon he has given, it is rather difficult to find out; but I  should think they are meant for those of king Richard II. Impaled on the  dexter side with those of his patron saint, Edward the Confessor.  Bearings that may be seen in divers places at Westminster Hall, rebuilt  by that monarch.[1]        [1] Vide MIRROR, p. 98, Vol. iii.    I have subjoined the _proper_ blazon of the arms, which is _azure_, a  cross patonce between _five_ martlets _or_, impaling France and England  quarterly, 1st. and 4th. azure three fleurs de lis. 2nd. _or_, 2nd and  3rd Gules, 3 lions passant guardant in pale, or.    The supporting of the arms with angels, &c. was a favourite device of  Richard, as may be seen in divers antiquarian and topographical works.    It is probable the hall of Croydon palace was built during the reign of  Richard, which will account for his arms being placed there.    I am, &c.    C. F.           *       *       *       *       *        DEATH OF MR. CANNING.      The lamentable and sudden death of the Right Hon. George Canning has  produced a general sensation throughout this country. At the opening of  the present year our nation deplored the loss of a prince endeared to  the people by his honest worth--but a short interval has elapsed and  again the country is plunged in sorrow for the loss of one of its most  zealous supporters--one of its chiefest ornaments--one of its staunchest  friends--and one of its most eloquent and talented statesmen! The life  of the late George Canning furnishes much matter for meditation and  thought. From it much may be learnt. He was a genius, in the most  unlimited sense of the word; and his intellectual endowments were  commanding and imperative. Of humble origin he had to contend with  innumerable difficulties, consequent to his station in life,--and  although his talents, which were of the first order, befitted him for  the first rank in society, that rank he did not attain until the scene  of this world was about to be closed for ever from him. It may be said  of this eminent man, that he owed nothing to patronage--his _talents_  directed him to his elevated station, and to his intellectual  superiority homage was made,--not to the man.    But, in other respects, the loss of Mr. Canning is a national  bereavement. He was one of the master-spirits of the age. His very name  was distinguished--for he has added to the literature of his country--by  his writings and his eloquence he has stimulated the march of mind; he  has seconded the exertions of liberal friends to the improvements of the  uneducated, and he has patronized the useful as well as the fine arts,  philosophy and science, of his country. To expatiate at greater length  would be superfluous, as we have in another place recorded our humble  tribute to his general character.[2] We have now, therefore, merely to  put together the melancholy facts connected with his death, and which  will convey to another generation a just sense of the value, in our  time, attached to a noble and exalted genius. The just and elegant  laconism of Byron, by substituting the _past_ for the _present_ tense,  may now be adopted as a faithful and brief summary of what _was_ George  Canning.        [2] Biographical Memoir of Mr. Canning, with a Portrait, MIRROR,          Vol. iv.    \"Canning _was_ a genius, almost an universal one:--an orator, a wit, a  poet, and a statesman.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The king, with his usual quickness, was the first to perceive the  dangerous state of Mr. Canning. We understand, that almost immediately  after he had quitted him, on Monday, his majesty observed to sir William  Knighton, that Mr. Canning appeared very unwell, and that he was in  great alarm for him. On Tuesday, sir William repaired to town, at the  express command of his majesty, to see Mr. Canning. At the interview  with him, at the Treasury, Sir William made particular inquiries into  the state of his health. Mr. Canning was then troubled with a cough, and  he observed to Sir William that he almost felt as if he were an old man;  that he was much weakened; but had no idea of there being anything  dangerous in his condition, and that he trusted that rest and retirement  would set him to rights. Sir William sent Dr. Maton to Mr. Canning, and  on parting with him, he observed that, as he should not leave town until  Wednesday morning, he would call on him, at Chiswick, on his way home to  Windsor. Sir William found Mr. Canning in bed, at Chiswick. He asked him  if he felt any pain in his side? Mr. Canning answered he had felt a pain  in his side for some days, and on endeavouring to lie on his side, the  pain was so acute that he was unable to do so. Sir William then inquired  if he felt any pain in his shoulder? He said he had been for some time  affected by rheumatic pains in the shoulder. Sir William told him that  the pain did not arise from rheumatism, but from a diseased liver, and  he immediately sent for the three physicians, who remained with him, and  were to the last unremitting in their attentions.    The disease continued to make rapid progress, in spite of all that the  first medical skill could do to baffle it, watching every turn it took,  and applying, on the instant, every remedy likely to subdue its  virulence, and mitigate his sufferings.    On the following Sunday, August 5, bulletins were issued, stating that  Mr. Canning was in most imminent danger. The most painful interest was  excited in the public mind by subsequent announcements of his alarming  state, and on Wednesday morning, the following melancholy intelligence  reached town:--    _Chiswick, Wednesday, August_, 8, 1827, (A. M.)    Mr. Canning expired this morning, without pain, at ten minutes before  four o'clock.           *       *       *       *       *        MISCELLANIES.           *       *       *       *       *      BLACK BEARD.

Put 'em on sharp; the bell 'll ring in a minute.\"    Several willing hands were stretched out to assist in arming Diggory for  the enterprise, and in a few moments he was assisted to the top of the  slide.    \"All right,\" he said; \"let go!\"    The spectators held their breath, hardly daring to watch what would  happen.  But fortune favours the brave.  The adventurous juvenile rushed  down the path, shot like an arrow through the doorway, and the next  instant was seen ploughing up the snow in the playground, and eventually  disappearing head first into the middle of a big drift.    His companions all rushed down in a body to haul him out of the snow.  Acton smacked him on the back, and called him a trump; while Jack Vance  presented him on the spot with a mince-pie, which had been slightly  damaged in one of the donor's many tumbles, but was, as he remarked,  \"just as good as new for eating.\"    From that moment until the day he left there was never a more popular  boy at The Birches than Diggory Trevanock.    \"I say,\" remarked Mugford, as they met a short time later in the  cloak-room, \"that was awfully good of you to go down the slide instead  of me; what ever made you do it?\"    \"Well,\" answered the other calmly, \"I thought it would save me a lot of  bother if I showed you fellows at once that I wasn't a muff.  I don't  mind telling you I was in rather a funk when it came to the start; but  I'd said I'd do it, and of course I couldn't draw back.\"    The numerous stirring events which happened at The Birches during the  next three terms, and which it will be my pleasing duty to chronicle in  subsequent chapters, gave the boys plenty of opportunity of testing the  character of their new companion, or, in plainer English, of finding out  the stuff he was made of; and whatever his other faults may have been,  this at least is certain, that no one ever found occasion to charge  Diggory Trevanock with being either a muff or a coward.    One might have thought that the slide episode would have afforded  excitement enough for a new boy's first day at school; yet before it  closed he was destined to be mixed up in an adventure of a still  more thrilling character.    The Birches was an old house, and though its outward appearance was  modern enough, the interior impressed even youthful minds with a feeling  of reverence for its age.  The heavy timbers, the queer shape of some of  the bedrooms and attics, the narrow, crooked passages, and the little  unexpected flights of stairs, were all things belonging to a bygone age,  of which the pupils were secretly proud, and which caused them to  remember the place, and think of it at the time, as being in some way  different from an ordinary school.    \"I say, Diggy,\" exclaimed Jack Vance, addressing the new boy by the  friendly abbreviation, which seemed by mutual consent to have been  bestowed upon him in recognition of his daring exploit--\"I say, Diggy,  you're in my bedroom: there's you, and me, and Mugford.  Mug's an awful  chump, but he's a good-natured old duffer, and you and I'll do the  fighting.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Why, sometimes when Blake is out spending the evening, and old Welsby  is shut up in his library, the different rooms make raids on one  another.  It began the term before last.  Blake had been teaching us all  about how the Crusaders used to go out every now and then and make war  in Palestine, and so the fellows on the west side of the house called  themselves the Crusaders, and we were Infidels, and they'd come over and  rag us, and we should drive them back.  Miss Eleanor came up one night,  and caught us in the middle of a battle.  O Diggy, she is a trump!  Blake asked her next day before us all which boys had been out on the  landing, because he meant to punish them; and she laughed, and said:  'I'm sure I can't tell you.  Why, when I saw they were all in their  night-shirts, I shut my eyes at once!'  Of course it was all an excuse  for not giving us away.  She doesn't mind seeing chaps in their  night-shirts when they're ill, we all know that; and once or twice  when for some reason or other she told us on the quiet that there  mustn't be any disturbance that evening, no one ever went crusading--  Acton would have licked them if they had.  Acton's going to propose to  Miss Eleanor some day, he told us so, and--\"    \"But what about the bedrooms?\" interrupted Diggory; \"have you given up  having crusades?\"    \"Yes, but we have other things instead.  We call our rooms by different  names, and it's all against all; one lot come and make a raid on you,  and then you go and pay them out.  This term Kennedy and Jacobs sleep in  the room above ours, and next to the big attic.  They're always reading  sea stories, and they call their room the 'Main-top,' because it's so  high up.  Then at the end of the passage are Acton, Shaw, and Morris,  and they're the 'House of Lords;' and next to them is the 'Dogs' Home,'  where all the other fellows are put.\"    A few hours later Diggory and his two room-mates were standing at the  foot of their beds and discussing the formation of a few simple rules  for conducting a race in undressing, the last man to put the candle out.    \"You needn't bother to race,\" said Mugford; \"I'll do it--I'm sure to be  the last.\"    \"No, you aren't,\" answered Vance.  \"We'll give you coat and waistcoat  start; it'll be good fun--\"    At this moment the door was suddenly flung open, two half-dressed  figures sprang into the room, and discharged a couple of snowballs  point-blank at its occupants.  One of the missiles struck Diggory on the  shoulder, and the other struck Mugford fair and square on the side of  the head, the fragments flying all over the floor.  There was a subdued  yell of triumph, the door was slammed to with a bang, and the muffled  sound of stockinged feet thudding up the neighbouring staircase showed  that the enemy were in full retreat.    \"It's those confounded Main-top men!\" cried Jack Vance; \"I will pay them  out.  I wonder where the fellows got the snow from?\"    \"Oh, I expect they opened the window and took it off the ledge,\"  answered Diggory.  \"Look here--let's sweep it up into this piece of  paper before it melts.\"    This having been done, the three friends hastily threw off their clothes  and scrambled into bed, forgetting all about the proposed race in their  eagerness to form some plan for an immediate retaliation on the  occupants of the \"Main-top.\"    \"I wonder if they'll hear anything of the ghost again this term?\" said  Mugford,    \"What ghost?\" asked Diggory.    \"Oh, it's nothing really,\" answered Vance; \"only somebody said once  that the house is haunted, and Kennedy and Jacobs say the ghost must be  in the big attic next their room.  They hear such queer noises sometimes  that they both go under the bed-clothes.\"    \"Do they always do that?\"    \"Yes, so they say, whenever there is a row.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Diggory, \"I'll tell you what we'll do: we'll go very  quietly up into that attic, and groan and knock on the wall until you  think they've both got their heads well under the clothes, and then  we'll rush in and bag their pillows, or drag them out of bed, or  something of that sort.  You aren't afraid to go into the attic, are  you?\" he continued, seeing that the others hesitated.  \"Why, of course  there are no such things as ghosts.  Or, look here, I'll go in, and  you can wait outside.\"    \"N--no, I don't mind,\" answered Vance; \"and it'll be an awful lark  catching them with their heads under the clothes.\"    \"All right, then, let's do it; though I suppose we'd better wait till  every one's in bed.\"    The last suggestion was agreed upon, and the three friends lay talking  in an undertone until the sound of footsteps and the gleam of a candle  above the door announced the fact that Mr. Blake was retiring to rest.    \"He's always last,\" said Vance; \"we must give him time to undress, and  then we'll start.\"    A quarter of an hour later the three boys, in semi-undress, were  creeping in single file up the narrow staircase.    \"Be careful,\" whispered Vance; \"there are several loose boards, and they  crack like anything.\"    The small landing was reached in safety, and the moon, shining faintly  through a little skylight formed of a single pane of glass, enabled them  to distinguish the outline of two doors.    Now it was a very different matter, when lying warm and snug in bed, to  talk about acting the ghost, from what it was, when standing shivering  in the cold and darkness, to put the project into execution.  During the  period of waiting the conversation had turned on haunted houses, and no  one seemed particularly anxious to claim as it were the post of honour,  and be the first to enter the big attic.    \"Go on!\" whispered Mugford, nudging Vance.    \"Go on!\" repeated the latter, giving Diggory's arm a gentle push.    The new boy had certainly undertaken to play the part of the ghost, and  there was no excuse for his backing out of it at the last moment.    \"All right,\" he muttered, \"I'll go.\"    Just then a terrible thing happened.  Diggory clutched the door-knob as  though it were the handle of a galvanic battery, while Mugford and Vance  seized each other by the arm and literally gasped for breath.    The stillness had been broken by a slight sound, as of something falling  inside the attic, and this was followed a moment later by a shrill,  unearthly scream.    For five seconds the three companions stood petrified with horror, not  daring to move; then followed another scream, if anything more horrible  than the last, and accompanied this time by the clanking rattle of a  chain being dragged across the floor.    That was enough.  Talk about a _sauve qui peut_! the"]]]
