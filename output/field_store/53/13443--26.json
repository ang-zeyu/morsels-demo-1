And then, without any warning whatsoever, the river we had followed so  confidently, came to an abrupt end--vanishing into the earth.    \"Good Lord!\" I said, \"who ever would have thought of this?\"    And I stared in amazement; then I turned to Tonnison. He was looking,  with a blank expression upon his face, at the place where the river  disappeared.    In a moment he spoke.    \"Let us go on a bit; it may reappear again--anyhow, it is worth  investigating.\"    I agreed, and we went forward once more, though rather aimlessly; for we  were not at all certain in which direction to prosecute our search. For  perhaps a mile we moved onward; then Tonnison, who had been gazing about  curiously, stopped and shaded his eyes.    \"See!\" he said, after a moment, \"isn't that mist or something, over  there to the right--away in a line with that great piece of rock?\" And  he indicated with his hand.    I stared, and, after a minute, seemed to see something, but could not be  certain, and said so.    \"Anyway,\" my friend replied, \"we'll just go across and have a glance.\"  And he started off in the direction he had suggested, I following.  Presently, we came among bushes, and, after a time, out upon the top of  a high, boulder-strewn bank, from which we looked down into a wilderness  of bushes and trees.    \"Seems as though we had come upon an oasis in this desert of stone,\"  muttered Tonnison, as he gazed interestedly. Then he was silent, his  eyes fixed; and I looked also; for up from somewhere about the center of  the wooded lowland there rose high into the quiet air a great column of  hazelike spray, upon which the sun shone, causing innumerable rainbows.    \"How beautiful!\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes,\" answered Tonnison, thoughtfully. \"There must be a waterfall, or  something, over there. Perhaps it's our river come to light again. Let's  go and see.\"    Down the sloping bank we made our way, and entered among the trees and  shrubberies. The bushes were matted, and the trees overhung us, so that  the place was disagreeably gloomy; though not dark enough to hide from  me the fact that many of the trees were fruit trees, and that, here and  there, one could trace indistinctly, signs of a long departed  cultivation. Thus it came to me that we were making our way through the  riot of a great and ancient garden. I said as much to Tonnison, and he  agreed that there certainly seemed reasonable grounds for my belief.    What a wild place it was, so dismal and somber! Somehow, as we went  forward, a sense of the silent loneliness and desertion of the old  garden grew upon me, and I felt shivery. One could imagine things  lurking among the tangled bushes; while, in the very air of the place,  there seemed something uncanny. I think Tonnison was conscious of this  also, though he said nothing.    Suddenly, we came to a halt. Through the trees there had grown upon our  ears a distant sound. Tonnison bent forward, listening. I could hear it  more plainly now; it was continuous and harsh--a sort of droning roar,  seeming to come from far away. I experienced a queer, indescribable,  little feeling of nervousness. What sort of place was it into which we  had got? I looked at my companion, to see what he thought of the matter;  and noted that there was only puzzlement in his face; and then, as I  watched his features, an expression of comprehension crept over them,  and he nodded his head.    \"That's a waterfall,\" he exclaimed, with conviction. \"I know the sound  now.\" And he began to push vigorously through the bushes, in the  direction of the noise.    As we went forward, the sound became plainer continually, showing that  we were heading straight toward it. Steadily, the roaring grew louder  and nearer, until it appeared, as I remarked to Tonnison, almost to come  from under our feet--and still we were surrounded by the trees  and shrubs.    \"Take care!\" Tonnison called to me. \"Look where you're going.\" And then,  suddenly, we came out from among the trees, on to a great open space,  where, not six paces in front of us, yawned the mouth of a tremendous  chasm, from the depths of which the noise appeared to rise, along with  the continuous, mistlike spray that we had witnessed from the top of the  distant bank.    For quite a minute we stood in silence, staring in bewilderment at the  sight; then my friend went forward cautiously to the edge of the abyss.  I followed, and, together, we looked down through a boil of spray at a  monster cataract of frothing water that burst, spouting, from the side  of the chasm, nearly a hundred feet below.    \"Good Lord!\" said Tonnison.    I was silent, and rather awed. The sight was so unexpectedly grand and  eerie; though this latter quality came more upon me later.    Presently, I looked up and across to the further side of the chasm.  There, I saw something towering up among the spray: it looked like a  fragment of a great ruin, and I touched Tonnison on the shoulder. He  glanced 'round, with a start, and I pointed toward the thing. His gaze  followed my finger, and his eyes lighted up with a sudden flash of  excitement, as the object came within his field of view.    \"Come along,\" he shouted above the uproar. \"We'll have a look at it.  There's something queer about this place; I feel it in my bones.\" And he  started off, 'round the edge of the craterlike abyss. As we neared this  new thing, I saw that I had not been mistaken in my first impression. It  was undoubtedly a portion of some ruined building; yet now I made out  that it was not built upon the edge of the chasm itself, as I had at  first supposed; but perched almost at the extreme end of a huge spur of  rock that jutted out some fifty or sixty feet over the abyss. In fact,  the jagged mass of ruin was literally suspended in midair.    Arriving opposite it, we walked out on to the projecting arm of rock,  and I must confess to having felt an intolerable sense of terror as I  looked down from that dizzy perch into the unknown depths below us--into  the deeps from which there rose ever the thunder of the falling water  and the shroud of rising spray.    Reaching the ruin, we clambered 'round it cautiously, and, on the  further side, came upon a mass of fallen stones and rubble. The ruin  itself seemed to me, as I proceeded now to examine it minutely, to be a  portion of the outer wall of some prodigious structure, it was so thick  and substantially built; yet what it was doing in such a position I  could by no means conjecture. Where was the rest of the house, or  castle, or whatever there had been?    I went back to the outer side of the wall, and thence to the edge of the  chasm, leaving Tonnison rooting systematically among the heap of stones  and rubbish on the outer side. Then I commenced to examine the surface  of the ground, near the edge of the abyss, to see whether there were not  left other remnants of the building to which the fragment of ruin  evidently belonged. But though I scrutinized the earth with the greatest  care, I could see no signs of anything to show that there had ever been  a building erected on the spot, and I grew more puzzled than ever.    Then, I heard a cry from Tonnison; he was shouting my name, excitedly,  and without delay I hurried along the rocky promontory to the ruin. I  wondered whether he had hurt himself, and then the thought came, that  perhaps he had found something.    I reached the crumbled wall and climbed 'round. There I found Tonnison  standing within a small excavation that he had made among the _debris_:  he was brushing the dirt from something that looked like a book, much  crumpled and dilapidated; and opening his mouth, every second or two, to  bellow my name. As soon as he saw that I had come, he handed his prize  to me, telling me to put it into my satchel so as to protect it from the  damp, while he continued his explorations. This I did, first, however,  running the pages through my fingers, and noting that they were closely  filled with neat, old-fashioned writing which was quite legible, save in  one portion, where many of the pages were almost destroyed, being  muddied and crumpled, as though the book had been doubled back at that  part. This, I found out from Tonnison, was actually as he had discovered  it, and the damage was due, probably, to the fall of masonry upon the  opened part. Curiously enough, the book was fairly dry, which I  attributed to its having been so securely buried among the ruins.    Having put the volume away safely, I turned-to and gave Tonnison a hand  with his self-imposed task of excavating; yet, though we put in over an  hour's hard work, turning over the whole of the upheaped stones and  rubbish, we came upon nothing more than some fragments of broken wood,  that might have been parts of a desk or table; and so we gave up  searching, and went back along the rock, once more to the safety of  the land.    The next thing we did was to make a complete tour of the tremendous  chasm, which we were able to observe was in the form of an almost  perfect circle, save for where the ruin-crowned spur of rock jutted out,  spoiling its symmetry.    The abyss was, as Tonnison put it, like nothing so much as a gigantic  well or pit going sheer down into the bowels of the earth.    For some time longer, we continued to stare about us, and then, noticing  that there was a clear space away to the north of the chasm, we bent our  steps in that direction.    Here, distant from the mouth of the mighty pit by some hundreds of  yards, we came upon a great lake of silent water--silent, that is, save  in one place where there was a continuous bubbling and gurgling.    Now, being away from the noise of the spouting cataract, we were able to  hear one another speak, without having to shout at the tops of our  voices, and I asked Tonnison what he thought of the place--I told him  that I didn't like it, and that the sooner we were out of it the better  I "]]]
