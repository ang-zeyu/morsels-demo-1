[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#19)"],[1," was the young man going selecting,  and thinking England was little farther, seeing his wife and child  were waving a year's good-bye from the platform.  There were sportsmen  going two hundred miles after quail and wallaby; and cars full of  ladies returning to the wilds after their yearly or half-yearly tilt  with society and fashion in Sydney; and there were the eight we are  interested in, clustering around the door and two windows, smiling  and waving cheerful good-byes to the Captain.    He did not look at all cast down as the train steamed fussily  away--indeed, he walked down the platform with almost a jaunty air as if  the prospect of two months bachelordom was not without its redeeming  points.    It was half-past six in the afternoon when they started, and they would  reach Curlewis, which was the nearest railway station to Yarrahappini,  about five the next morning.  The expense of  sleeping-berths had been  out of the question with so many of them; but in the rack with the bags  were several rolls of rugs and two or three air-pillows against the  weary hours.  The idea of so many hours in the train had been delightful  to all the young ones; none of them but Judy had been a greater distance  than forty or fifty miles before, and it seemed perfectly fascinating  to think of rushing on and on through the blackness as well as the  daylight.    But long before ten o'clock a change came o'er the spirit of their  dreams.  Nell and Baby had had a quarrel over the puffing out of the  air-cushions, and were too tired and cross to make it up again;  Pip  had hit Bunty over the head for no ostensible reason, and received  two kicks in return; Judy's head ached, and the noise, was not calculated  to cure it; Meg had grown weary of staring out into the moving darkness,  and wondering whether Alan would notice she was never on the river-boat  now; and the poor little General was filling the hot air with  expostulations, in the shape of loud roars, at the irregularities of  the treatment he was undergoing.    Esther had taken his day clothes off, and made a picture of him in  a cream flannel nightgown and a pink wool jacket.  And for half an  hour, he had submitted good-temperedly to being handed about and  tickled and half-smothered with kisses.  He had eyen permitted Nell to  bite his little pink toes severally, and say a surprising amount of  nonsense about little pigs that went to market and did similarly  absurd things.    He had hardly remonstrated when there had been a dispute about the  possession of his person, and Bunty had clung to his head and body  while Nell pulled vigorously at his legs.    But after a time, when Esther made him a little bed on one of the  seats and tried to lay him down upon it, a sense of his grievances  came over him.    He had a swinging cot at home; with little gold bars at the foot to  blink at--he could not see why he should be mulcted of it, and made to  put up with a rug three times doubled.  He was accustomed, too, to a  shaded light, a quiet room, and a warning H'sh! h'sh! whenever  people forgot themselves sufficiently to make the slightest noise.    Here the great yellow light flared all the time, and every one of the  noisy creatures at whose hands he endured so much was within a few  feet of him.    So he lifted up his voice and wept.  And when he found weeping did not  produce his gold-barred cot, and the little dangling tassels on the  mosquito nets, he raised his voice two notes, and when even there  Esther only went on patting his shoulder in a soothing way he burst  into roars absolutely deafening.    Nellie dangled all her long curls in his face to engage his  attention, but he clutched them viciously and pulled till the tears  came into her eyes.  Esther and Meg sang lullabies till their tongues  ached, Judy tried walking him up and down the narrow space, but he  stiffened himself in her arms, and she was not strong enough to hold  him.  Finally he dropped off into an exhausted sleep, drawing deep,  sobbing breaths and little hiccoughs of sorrow.    Then Bunty was discovered asleep on the floor with his head under a seat,  and had to be lifted into an easier position; and Baby, bolt upright  in a corner, was nodding like a little pink-and-white daisy the sun has  been too much for.    One by one the long hours dragged away; farther and farther through  the silent, sleeping country flew the red-eyed train, swerving round  zigzag curves, slackening up steeper places, flashing across the  endless stretching plains.    The blackness grew grey and paler grey, and miles and miles of  monotonous gum saplings lay between the train and sky.  Up burst  the sun, and the world grew soft and rosy like a baby waked from  sleep.  Then the grey gathered again, the pink, quivering lights  faded out, and the rain came down--torrents of it, beating against  the shaking window-glass, whirled wildly ahead by a rough morning  wind, flying down from the mountains.  Such a crushed, dull-eyed,  subdued-looking eight they were as they tumbled out on the Curlewis  platform when five o'clock came.  Judy coughed at the wet, early,  air, and was hurried into the waiting-room and wrapped in a rug.    Then the train tossed out their trunks and portmanteaux and rushed on  again, leaving them desolate and miserable, looking after it, for it  seemed no one had come to meet them.    The sound of wet wheels slushing through puddles, the crack of a whip,  the even falling of horses' feet, and they were all outside again,  looking beyond the white railway palings to the road.    There were a big, covered waggonette driven by a wide yellow oil-skin  with a man somewhere in its interior, and a high buggy, from which an  immensely tall man was climbing.    \"Father!\"    Esther rushed out into the rain.  She put her arms round the dripping  mackintosh and clung fast to it for a minute or two.  Perhaps that is  what made her cheeks and eyes so wet and shining.    \"Little girl--little Esther child!\" he said, and almost lifted her  off the ground as he kissed her, tall though Meg considered her.    Then he hurried them all off into the buggies, five in one and three  in the other.  There was a twenty-five-mile drive before them yet.    \"When did you have anything to eat last?\" he asked; the depressed  looks of the children were making him quite unhappy.  \"Mother has  sent you biscuits and sandwiches, but we, can't get coffee or  anything hot till we get home.\"    Nine o'clock, Esther told him, at Newcastle, but it was so boiling  hot they had had to leave most of it in their cups and scramble into  the train again.  The horses were whipped up; and flew over the  muddy roads at a pace that Pip, despite his weariness, could not but  admire.    But it was a very damp, miserable drive, and the General wept with  hardly a break from start to finish, greatly to Esther's vexation,  for it was his first introduction to his grandfather.    At last, when everyone was beginning to feel the very end of patience  had come, a high white gate broke the monotony of dripping wet  fences.    \"Home!\" Esther said joyfully.  She jumped the General up and down on  her knee.    \"Little Boy Blue, Mum fell off that gate when she was three,\" said she,  looking at it affectionately as Pip swung it open.    Splash through the rain again; the wheels went softly now, for the  way was covered with wet fallen leaves.    \"Oh, where IS the house?\" Bunty said, peeping through Pip's arm  on the box seat, and seeing still nothing but an endless vista of  gum trees.  \"I thought, you said we were there, Esther.\"    \"Oh, the front door is not quite so near the gate as at Misrule,\"  she said.  And indeed it was not.    It was fifteen minutes before they even saw the chimneys, then there  was another gate to be opened.  A gravel drive now trimly kept,  high box round the flower-beds, a wilderness of rose bushes that  pleased Meg's eye, two chip tennis-courts under water.    Then the house.    The veranda was all they noticed; such a wide one it was, as wide as  an ordinary room, and there were lounges and chairs and tables  scattered about, hammocks swung from the corners, and a green thick  creeper with rain-blown wisteria for an outer wall.    \"O--o--oh,\" said Pip; \"o--oh!  I AM stiff--o--oh, I say, what are you  doing?\"    For Esther had deposited her infant on his knee, and leapt out of  the waggonette and up the veranda steps.    There was a tiny old lady there, with a great housekeeping apron  on.  Esther gathered her right up in her arms, and they kissed and  clung to each other till they were both crying.    \"My little girl!\" sobbed the little old lady, stroking, with eager  hands, Esther's wet hair and wetter cheeks.    And Bunty, who had followed close behind, looked from the tall figure  of his stepmother to the very small one of her mother and laughed.    Esther darted back to the buggy, took the General from Pip, and,  springing up the steps again, placed him in her mother's arms.    \"Isn't he a fat 'un!\" Bunty said, sharing in her pride; \"just you  look at his legs.\"    The old lady sat down for one minute in the wettest chair she could  find, and cuddled him close up to her.    But he doubled his little cold fists, fought himself free, and  yelled for Esther.    Mr. Hassal had emptied the buggies by now, and came up the steps  himself.    \"Aren't you going to give them some breakfast, little mother?\" he  said, and the old lady nearly dropped her grandson in her distress.    \"Dear, dear!\" she said.  \"Well, well! Just to think of it!  But it  makes one forget.\"    In ten minutes they were all in dry things, sitting in the warm  dining-room and making prodigious breakfasts.    \"WASN'T I hungry!\" Bunty said.  His mouth was full of toast, and he  was slicing the top off his fourth egg and keeping an eye on a dish  that held honey in one compartment and clotted cream in another.    \"The dear old plates!\" Esther picked hers up after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#19)"],[1,"those who profess to be the apostles of \"Mormonism,\" it will afford      me satisfaction equalled, I have no doubt, only by that which      yourself will feel on this subject.        I remain, very respectfully and truly,        Your friend,        CHAS. ANTHON.        Rev. Dr. T. W. Coit, New Rochelle, N. Y. [8]    It will be observed that there is a discrepancy between the letter  written by Professor Anthon to the Rev. Mr. Coit and the one he sent to  E. D. Howe. In the latter he states that he refused to give his opinion  in writing on the characters submitted to him; but in his letter to  Rev. Coit he says that he gave a written opinion to Harris without  hesitation, and to the effect that the marks on the paper appeared to  be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters that had  no meaning at all connected with them. According to Martin Harris'  statement he gave him a certificate to the effect that the characters  submitted were genuine, and that the translation accompanying them was  correct; but upon hearing that the existence of the Nephite plates  was made known to Joseph Smith by a heavenly messenger, he requested  the return of the paper he had given Martin Harris, and he destroyed  it, saying that the visitation of angels had ceased, etc., I shall  leave it for the anti--\"Mormon\" friends of Mr. Anthon to reconcile the  contradiction that occurs in his statements, merely remarking that  since the doctor in one letter declares that he refused to give Martin  Harris a written opinion on the characters; and in the other that he  gave him a written opinion, increases very much one's faith in Martin  Harris' statement as against that of Professor Anthon's upon this  point; namely, that the Professor gave Harris a written statement, but  afterwards recalled and destroyed it. The reader should observe also  that in his letter to Rev. Coit, written in 1841, the Professor says  that no one until that time had ever requested from him a statement  in writing on the subject of his connection with the Book of Mormon.  Yet as a matter of fact E. D. Howe had addressed him a letter on the  subject, asking him for a statement, in 1834, to which request the  professor responded, telling substantially the same story as in this  letter to Rev. Coit, excepting as to the written opinion furnished  to Harris. The contradictions in Anthon's letters leave him in a  most unenviable situation; and doubtless accounts for anti-\"Mormons\"  publishing extracts only from his letters.    The statements of Professor Anthon and Martin Harris are very  contradictory, but the sequence will show that there is much that  supports the statement of Martin Harris in the main as true; while  the anxiety of the professor to disconnect himself as far as possible  from any association with \"these wretched fanatics,\" will account for  his version of the incident. The object of Mr. Harris in presenting  these transcribed characters to the learned professor was, undoubtedly,  to learn if they were true characters, or only the idle invention of  Joseph Smith. That the answer of Professor Anthon and Dr. Mitchell was  in favor of their being true characters is evidenced by the fact that  Martin Harris returned immediately to Joseph Smith, in Harmony, made  his report, and thence went to Palmyra, in New York, to arrange his  business affairs that he might hasten back to Pennsylvania to become  the amanuensis of the young Prophet in the work of translation. This  Martin Harris would not likely have done if Professor Anthon's answer  had been what that gentleman represents it to have been in his letters  to Mr. Howe and Rev. Coit; nor would Martin Harris have ventured,  subsequently, to have furnished the money to pay for the publication  of the first edition of the book, had he been assured by the professor  that the whole thing was a \"hoax\" or a \"scheme\" to cheat him out of his  money.    As stated above, Martin Harris returned to Palmyra after this interview  with Professor Anthon, arranged his affairs, and joined the Prophet  in Harmony, about the 12th of April, 1828, when he commenced writing  as Joseph translated. This work he continued until the 14th of June  following--two months, by which time they had translated enough to make  one hundred and sixteen pages of manuscript, of large sheets--usually  called fool's cap paper.    Soon after Mr. Harris commenced to write for the Prophet he began to  importune him for the privilege of showing so much of the translation  as they had made to a number of his friends. This request the Prophet  refused to grant. Nothing daunted by this refusal, Harris asked the  Prophet to inquire of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim if he  might not have that privilege. This Joseph did, and Harris' request  was denied. He importuned him to ask again, with the like result, and  yet again did he implore that the Prophet would ask the Lord for his  permission.    \"After much solicitation,\" says the Prophet, in his account of this  affair, \"I again inquired of the Lord, and permission was granted  him to have the writings on certain conditions; which were, that he  should show them only to his brother, Preserved Harris, his own wife,  his father and his mother, and a Mrs. Cobb, a sister of his wife. In  accordance with this last answer, I required of him that he should bind  himself in a covenant to me in the most solemn manner that he would not  do otherwise than had been directed. He did so. He bound himself as  I required of him, took the writings, and went his way;\" [9] and the  Prophet took advantage of the absence of Harris, who had acted as his  scribe, to visit his parents at Manchester.    The solemn engagement which Martin Harris made with the Prophet he  broke. He showed the writings to other persons than those named in his  agreement with the Prophet, and these stole the precious manuscript  from him, and he was never able to recover it. This circumstance also  went hard with Joseph as to his standing with the Lord. He had allowed  himself to be over-persuaded by the importunities of Martin Harris,  and that after he had twice learned that it was not the will of the  Lord that Harris should have the manuscript. He learned that Harris  had lost the one hundred and sixteen pages of manuscript while he was  yet in Manchester visiting with his parents; and immediately returned  to Harmony, where he humbled himself in prayer before God that he  might obtain forgiveness for his error; but apparently to no immediate  purpose, for Moroni appeared to him and demanded the plates and also  the Urim and Thummim. These were surrendered, with what anguish of  soul one may readily understand. Exactly what length of time they were  withheld from him cannot be determined, but evidently not long; for  in July of the same year the angel guardian of the record, Moroni,  appeared to him again and presented the plates and Urim and Thummim to  him. The Prophet, through the medium of the holy instrument, obtained  the following revelation which bears the date of July, 1828: [10]        \"The works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be      frustrated, neither can they come to naught. For God doth not walk      in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand, nor      to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said,      therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal      round.        \"Remember, remember, that it is not the work of God that is      frustrated, but the work of men; for although a man may have many      revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he      boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God,      and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires,      he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.        \"Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but how strict      were your commandments; and remember also the promises which were      made to you, if you did not transgress them. And behold, how oft      you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and      have gone on in the persuasions of men. For, behold, you should      not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the      counsels of God, and despise his words--yet you should have been      faithful; and he would have extended his arm and supported you      against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have      been with you in every time of trouble.        \"Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to do the work of      the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou      wilt fall. But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that      which thou hast done, which is contrary to the commandment which I      gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to the      work; except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up and become as      other men, and have no more gift.        \"And when thou deliveredst up that which God had given thee sight      and power to translate, thou deliveredst up that which was sacred      into the hands of a wicked man, who has set at naught the counsels      of God, and has broken the most sacred promises which were made      before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and boasted in      his own wisdom. And this is the reason that thou hast lost thy      privileges for a season--for thou hast suffered the counsel of thy      director to be trampled upon from the beginning. Nevertheless, my      work shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior has      come unto the world, through the testimony of the Jews, even so      shall the knowledge of a Savior come unto my people--and to the      Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites,      [11] through the testimony of their fathers--and this testimony      shall come to the knowledge of the"]]]
