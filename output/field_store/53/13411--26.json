These fronts were cleaned whenever necessary, and then oiled with fresh  raw linseed oil from the press, put on pretty much as carefully as in  ordinary varnish work. No second coat or lapping over of the oil. All  was put on at once that it would take without running down in streams.    The result: the oil penetrates into good dry stone probably 11/2 inches,  making the stone hard and flinty, as any stone cutter will soon find out  if he tries to trim it.    It keeps the damp and therefore the frost out of the stone, as will be  seen any foggy day, the damp running down in streams on the oiled stone,  and the unoiled stone absorbing the dampness. It is therefore necessary  to oil during dry weather.    The oil is especially beneficial to balustrades and carvings, as they  are generally got out of soft stone. It is also beneficial underneath  balconies and porches, as the sun never has a chance to dry the stone in  such situations before the frost flakes it.    This I send in part payment for the great deal I have learned from your  paper.    T.H. Rilley    New York City.           *       *       *       *       *          Interesting Correspondence from China.      Messrs. Editors:--Your paper seems to increase in interest. I brought  the back volumes from Madras to Pekin, and am glad to refer to them here  where I must depend upon myself.    I have been building and repairing premises since I came here last year.  I find the carpenters and masons are very much delighted with our tools,  especially our saws, planes, borers, vise, and hammers. Our lathe is a  wonder. They use only the ancient spindle turned backwards and forwards  by a treadle or by the left hand while the right guides the chisel or  turning-tool, which cuts only half the time. They use only the turning  saw, which often fails them because it cannot be used in splitting wide  boards in the middle, and in many other places. They are great sawyers,  however. They stand heavy pine spars on end, if rather short, say 8  feet, the common length of many intended for making coffins, and cut  them up into three-eighths or half-inch stuff with great patience. A  longer one they will lean over and prop up, raising it towards the  perpendicular as they advance. They must have some hard jobs. I have  just measured a poplar plank in front of a coffin manufactory, which I  found to be 5 ft. 3 in. at the butt, 3 ft. 10 in. at the top, 8 feet  long, and about 8 inches thick. For a crosscut saw they rig one like  our wood-saw. I am sure it would deeply interest you to make a visit to  Pekin and see how this ancient, patient, and industrious people do their  work. It is truly painful to see how much time they spend in making  the simplest tool for want of at least a few labor-saving appliances.  Doubtless you have their tools on show in New York. They are to me an  interesting study, though I have been long familiar with the rude tools  of the Hindoos. It is constantly suggested to me that we must have got  many hints from the Chinese, or else indeed they have taken hints from  the West; or again, which is perhaps the true solution, implements like  words have a common origin. I should think from what I have observed in  a short time, that the Chinese resemble the Europeans in their tools  more than the Hindoos--a thing I did not at all anticipate. A clever man  could write you an interesting chapter on the ways of the Pekinese,  the Chinese Manchus, Mongols, and the rest mixed together, though the  Chinese are confessedly the workers in wood, iron, and everything else.  The Manchus are mostly hangers on of the government, living mainly upon  a miserable monthly stipend.    The reading of your unequaled journal makes me interested in you as if  you were personal friends, and so I have run away with these pointless  remarks. I am sure you will excuse me, and not wonder that one wishes to  breathe now and then.    I was an old subscriber in Madras, and hope to be till I can read no  longer. My son, who perished at Andersonville, was a subscriber to the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN till the day of his capture by Mosby.    Pekin, China.    P.R. Hunt.           *       *       *       *       *          Communication Between Deaf and Blind Mutes.      Messrs. Editors:--In a recent number of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN I notice  an ingenious method of teaching deaf and dumb persons to converse in  the dark, which is also applicable to blind mutes, and it brings to my  recollection a method which was in use among the \"telegraph boys\" some  years ago when I was one of them. Sometimes when we were visiting and  asked to communicate to a \"brother chip,\" anything that it was not  advisable for the persons around us to know, a slight tap-tapping on the  table or chair would draw the attention of the party we asked to talk  to, and then by his watching the forefinger of the writer, if across the  room, or if near enough, by placing the hand of the writer carelessly  on the shoulder of the party we desired to communicate with, the  communication was written out in the telegraph alphabet or by taking  hold of his hand and writing upon the finger.    I think this method will be found much less complicated, if not quite as  rapid, as the method with both hands, and much more convenient, as it is  only necessary to have hold of one hand of the person communicated with,  and is more rapid than writing with a pen.    For the benefit of those not acquainted with the telegraph alphabet, I  give it:       A    B    C    D     E    F    G     H    I    .-  -...  ...  -..    .   .-.  --.  ....   ..       J     K     L    M    N    O     P     Q    -.-.  -.-   ---   --   -.  . .  .....  ..-.        R      S     T    U     V     W     X     Y     . ..   ...    -   ..-   ...-  .--   ..-.  .. ..       Z    ... .    The uninitiated will observe that O differs from I in the distance  between the dots, made thus: I by two quick strokes of the forefinger; O  by one quick stroke, slight pause, and another quick stroke; the dashes  are made by holding the finger down for a short space: thus SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN would be written:        S    C    I   E  N   T   I   F   I    C     ...  .. .  ..  .  -.  -  ..  .-.  ..  .. .        A   M   E    R    I    C     A    N     .-  --   .   . ..  ..  .. .  .-    -.    In a very short time any one can learn to read by the sight or by the  touch. Anything which can add to the pleasure or comfort of these  unfortunates is of importance.    MAGNET    [Nothing can compensate for want of rapidity in a language designed for  colloquy. Although our correspondent found the Morse telegraph alphabet  a resource on occasion, he would scarcely be content to use it, and it  only for life, even if emancipation from it involved months of labor.  The motions required to spell SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN by the telegraph  alphabet are thirty-nine, but as the short dashes occupy the time of two  dots for each dash, and there are eight of these, eight more ought to be  counted in a comparison of it with an alphabet composed wholly of dots,  this would make forty-seven. To spell the same words in full by the mute  alphabet referred to would require only twenty-three motions. A still  greater disparity in rate would, we think, be found in an entire  colloquial sentence. Thus the sentence \"Hand me an apple\" would require,  by the mute alphabet, the time of fourteen dots, while with the  telegraph alphabet it would require the time of thirty-nine.--Eds.]           *       *       *       *       *          Cheap Cotton Press Wanted.      Messrs. Munn & Co.:--Please give us any information of cheap  cotton-presses, such as small neighborhoods, or single planters, in the  South could own. In particular, a press that will put 40 pounds cotton  into each cubic foot. We want cotton better handled, and to that end may  want small bales, say 150 pounds each. But these must be put into three  or four cubic feet, or they will cost too much for covering, ties, etc.  Perhaps you can furnish us with a wood-cut of some, or several, presses  worked by hand, or by horse-power, that will do good service, not cost  too much, be simple in operation, not require too much power, and be  effective as above. It may be for the interest of some of your clients  or correspondents to give us the facts, as we shall put them into  a report for circulation amongst the entire cotton interest of the  country.

Editors:--In my library hangs a powerful horseshoe magnet which  has a keeper and a weight attached of about three ounces. This weight  is sustained firmly by the attracting power of the magnet, and is not  easily shaken off by any oscillating motion, yet through some (to me)  unknown cause during each of the last ten nights the magnet has lost its  power, and the keeper and weight lie in the morning on the bottom of the  case where the magnet has hung for many years without a like occurrence,  except once on the occasion of a severe shock of an earthquake which  took place December 17, 1867.    There is no possible way for this magnet to be disturbed except by the  electric current; then why should its power thus return without the aid  of a battery or keeper? Will some one explain?
