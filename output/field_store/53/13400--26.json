Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no  market value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can  be used. (Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water  draws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press  and evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found  to make very good jelly. They are valuable to the consumer by converting  the perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant  years into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over  to years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant  form to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of  great interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value  for purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,  for use as a beverage and intoxicant.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.      It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to  grow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that  a new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,  Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit  and hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in  this country. It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to  the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby  rendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality  generally. The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire  support. It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases  the amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a  result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it  and the bag. M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper  by employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage  thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative  inefficacy. In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an  average of 7 deg. more than the straight ones, while there was a difference  of 10 deg. when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the  practical value of the invention.    Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of  grapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only  be determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,  either under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel  the full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their  utility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental  varieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are  scarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened. At  any rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to  neutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.  As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the  best of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen  out of doors, and even these do not always succeed. We know next to  nothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much  appreciated in many parts of the Continent. The fact is, our outdoor  culture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under  glass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords  some excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid  reason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a  general way.    [Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]    Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and  checking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to  get the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes  would often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average  temperature.    [Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]    If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical  contrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average  warmth some 10 deg. higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure  the grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor  culture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now  practicable.    [Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]    The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying  mildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting  administered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for  the season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving  rains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and  autumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.    [Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]    The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these  glass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening  of pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being  employed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and  shapes. In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing  the maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to  preserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J. COBNHILL, _in  the Garden_.           *       *       *       *       *          UTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.      At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an  experiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the  English public and military authorities.    Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration  and utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very  brilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which  printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the  _Soleil Journal_.    The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the  same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive  steam-engine at work. As may be supposed, the only object was to  demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the  solar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems  capable of great utility in existing circumstances. Here in France,  indeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.    Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have  suggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other  mode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been  lacking. This void this apparatus will fill up. About fifteen years ago  Professor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and  his experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much  labor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea. A company has now come  to his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes  at a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them. It is  evident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be  heated in thirty or forty minutes. A portable apparatus could boil two  and one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying  by distillation or ebullition six or eight men. The apparatus can be  easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the  worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is  insured. M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published  an interesting volume on the invention. I was able yesterday to verify  his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee  made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of  fuel. The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it  is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field  good water and to cook his food rapidly. The invention is of especial  importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is  settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.    Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission  forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report  immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen  fighting abroad for their country. I may, of course, be mistaken, but  a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest  delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London  Times_.           *       *       *       *       *          HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.    [Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]    By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.    INTRODUCTORY.      The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been  of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,  and the explorer over desert wastes. In these, its legitimate uses, the  needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate  determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very  unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and  even death.    For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to  dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle  in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of  traversing from a true meridian. This method, however, involves a  greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are  generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be  readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application  in practice.    Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the  true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8564"],[0,"Life and Travels of Mungo Park (#19)"],[1," Krieko is here but a  small rivulet; this beautiful stream takes its rise a little to the  eastward of this town, and descends with a rapid and noisy current until  it reaches the bottom of the high hill called Tappa, where it becomes  more placid, and winds gently through the lovely plains of Kooniakary;  after which, having received an additional branch from the north, it is  lost in the Senegal, somewhere near the falls of Felow.    Feb. 8th. This day we travelled over a rough stony country, and having  passed Seimpo and a number of other villages, arrived in the afternoon at  Lackarago, a small village, which stands upon the ridge of hills that  separates the kingdoms of Kasson and Kaarta. In the course of the day we  passed many hundreds of people flying from Kaarta, with their families  and effects.    Feb. 9th. Early in the morning we departed from Lackarago, and a little  to the eastward came to the brow of a hill, from whence we had an  extensive view of the country. Towards the south-east were perceived some  very distant hills, which our guide told us were the mountains of  Fooladoo. We travelled with great difficulty down a stony and abrupt  precipice, and continued our way in the bed of a dry river course, where  the trees meeting over head made the place dark and cool. In a little  time we reached the bottom of this romantic glen, and about ten o'clock  emerged from between two rocky hills, and found ourselves on the level  and sandy plains of Kaarta. At noon we arrived at a Korree, or  watering-place, where, for a few strings of beads, I purchased as much  milk and corn-meal as we could eat: indeed, provisions are here so cheap,  and the shepherds live in such affluence, that they seldom ask any,  return for what refreshments a traveller receives from them. From this  Korree we reached Feesurah at sunset, where we took up our lodging for  the night.    Feb. 10th. We continued at Feesurah all this day, to have a few clothes  washed, and learn more exactly the situation of affairs before we  ventured towards the capital.    Feb. 11th. Our landlord, taking advantage of the unsettled state of the  country, demanded so extravagant a sum for our lodging, that suspecting  he wished for an opportunity to quarrel with us, I refused to submit to  his exorbitant demand; but my attendants were so much frightened at the  reports of approaching wars that they refused to proceed any further,  unless I could settle matters with him, and induce him to accompany us to  Kemmoo, for our protection on the road. This I accomplished with some  difficulty, and by a present of a blanket which I had brought with me to  sleep in, and for which our landlord had conceived a very great liking:  matters were at length amicably adjusted, and he mounted his horse and  led the way. He was one of those Negroes who, together with the  ceremonial part of the Mahomedan religion, retain all their ancient  superstitions, and even drink strong liquors. They are called Johars, or  Jowers, and in this kingdom form a very numerous and powerful tribe. We  had no sooner got into a dark and lonely part of the first wood, than he  made a sign for us to stop, and taking hold of a hollow piece of bamboo,  that hung as an amulet round his neck, whistled very loud three times. I  confess I was somewhat startled, thinking it was a signal for some of his  companions to come and attack us; but he assured me that it was done  merely with a view to ascertain what success we were likely to meet with  on our present journey. He then dismounted, laid his spear across the  road, and having said a number of short prayers, concluded with three  loud whistles; after which he listened for some time, as if in  expectation of an answer, and receiving none, told us we might proceed  without fear, for there was no danger. About noon we passed a number of  large villages quite deserted, the inhabitants having fled into Kasson to  avoid the horrors of war. We reached Karankalla at sunset; this formerly  was a large town, but having been plundered by the Bambarrans about four  years ago, nearly one half of it is still in ruins.    Feb. 12th. At daylight we departed from Karankalla, and as it was but a  short day's journey to Kemmoo, we travelled slower than usual, and amused  ourselves by collecting such eatable fruits as grew near the road-side.  In this pursuit I had wandered a little from my people, and being  uncertain whether they were before or behind me, I hastened to a rising  ground to look about me. As I was proceeding towards this eminence, two  Negro horsemen, armed with muskets, came galloping from among the bushes:  on seeing them I made a full stop; the horsemen did the same; and all  three of us seemed equally surprised and confounded at this interview. As  I approached them, their fears increased, and one of them, after casting  upon me a look of horror, rode off at full speed; the other, in a panic  of fear, put his hands over his eyes, and continued muttering prayers  until his horse, seemingly without the rider's knowledge, conveyed him  slowly after his companion. About a mile to the westward, they fell in  with my attendants, to whom they related a frightful story: it seems  their fears had dressed me in the flowing robes of a tremendous spirit;  and one of them affirmed, that when I made my appearance, a cold blast of  wind came pouring down upon him from the sky, like so much cold water.  About noon we saw at a distance the capital of Kaarta, situated in the  middle of an open plain, the country for two miles round being cleared of  wood, by the great consumption of that article for building and fuel, and  we entered the town about two o'clock in the afternoon.    We proceeded without stopping to the court before the king's residence  but I was so completely surrounded by the gazing multitude, that I did  not attempt to dismount, but sent in the landlord and Madi Konko's son,  to acquaint the king of my arrival. In a little time they returned  accompanied by a messenger from the king, signifying that he would see me  in the evening; and, in the meantime, the messenger had orders to procure  me a lodging, and see that the crowd did not molest me. He conducted me  into a court, at the door of which he stationed a man, with a stick in  his hand, to keep off the mob, and then showed me a large hut, in which I  was to lodge. I had scarcely seated myself in this spacious apartment,  when the mob entered; it was found impossible to keep them out, and I was  surrounded by as many as the hut could contain. When the first party,  however, had seen me; and asked a few questions, they retired to make  room for another company; and in this manner the hut was filled and  emptied thirteen different times.    A little before sunset, the king sent to inform me that he was at  leisure, and wished to see me. I followed the messenger through a number  of courts surrounded with high walls, where I observed plenty of dry  grass bundled up like hay, to fodder the horses in case the town should  be invested. On entering the court in which the king was sitting, I was  astonished at the number of his attendants, and at the good order that  seemed to prevail among them; they were all seated, the fighting men on  the king's right hand, and the women and children on the left, leaving a  space between them for my passage. The king, whose name was Daisy  Koorabarri, was not to be distinguished from his subjects by any  superiority in point of dress; a bank of earth about two feet high, upon  which was spread a leopard's skin, constituted the only mark of royal  dignity. When I had seated myself upon the ground before him, and related  the various circumstances that had induced me to pass through his  country, and my reasons for soliciting his protection, he appeared  perfectly satisfied; but said it was not in his power at present to  afford me much assistance; for that all sort of communication between  Kaarta and Bambarra had been interrupted for some time past; and as  Mansong, the King of Bambarra, with his army had entered Fooladoo in his  way to Kaarta, there was but little hope of my reaching Bambarra by any  of the usual routes, inasmuch as, coming from an enemy's country, I  should certainly be plundered or taken for a spy. If his country had been  at peace, he said, I might have remained with him until a more favourable  opportunity offered; but as matters stood at present, he did not wish me  to continue in Kaarta, for fear some accident should befal me, in which  case my countrymen might say that he had murdered a white man. He would  therefore advise me to return into Kasson, and remain there until the war  should terminate, which would probably happen in the course of three or  four months; after which, if he was alive, he said, he would be glad to  see me, and if he was dead, his sons would take care of me.    This advice was certainly well meant on the part of the king; and perhaps  I was to blame in not following it; but I reflected that the hot months  were approaching; and I dreaded the thoughts of spending the rainy season  in the interior of Africa. These considerations, and the aversion I felt  at the idea of returning without having made a greater progress in  discovery, made me determine to go forwards; and though the king could  not give me a guide to Bambarra, I begged that he would allow a man to  accompany me as near the frontiers of his kingdom as was consistent with  safety. Finding that I was determined to proceed, the king told me that  one route still remained, but that, he said, was by no means free from  danger; which was to go from Kaarta into the Moorish kingdom of Ludamar,  from whence I might pass, by a circuitous route, into Bambarra. If I  wished to follow this route, he would appoint people to conduct me to  Jarra, the frontier town of Ludamar. He then enquired very particularly  how I had been treated since I had left the"]]]
