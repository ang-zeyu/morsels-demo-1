[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#19)"],[1,"abl. Virg. Ec. 3, 77. _Quoque_==even. For its position in  the sentence, cf. note, 3.    _Concessis animalibus_. Such as the Romans and other civilized nations  offer, in contradistinction to _human_ sacrifices, which the author  regards as _in_-concessa. The attempt has been made to remove from the  Germans the stain of human sacrifices. But it rests on incontrovertible  evidence (cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax., App. to B. 2. cap. 3), and indeed  attaches to them only in common with nearly all uncivilized nations. The  Gauls and Britons, and the Celtic nations generally, carried the practice  to great lengths, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 15. The neighbors of the Hebrews  offered human victims in great numbers to their gods, as we learn from  the Scriptures. Nay, the reproach rests also upon the Greeks and Romans  in their early history. Pliny informs us, that men were sacrificed as  late as the year of Rome 657.    _Isidi_. The Egyptian Isis in Germany! This shows, how far the Romans  went in comparing the gods of different nations. Gr. Ritter identifies  this goddess with the Nertha of chap. 40, the Egyptian Isis and Nertha  being both equivalent to Mother Earth, the Terra or Tellus of the Romans.    _Liburnae_. A light galley, so called from the Liburnians, a people of  Illyricum, who built and navigated them. The _signum_, here likened to a  galley, was more probably a rude crescent, connected with the worship of  the moon, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 21: Germani deorum numero ducunt Solem et  _Lunam_.    _Cohibere parietibus_==aedificiis includere, K. T. elsewhere speaks of  temples of German divinities (e.g. 40: templum Nerthi; Ann. 1, 51:  templum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove or any other sacred place was  called _templum_ by the Romans (templum from [Greek: temno], cut off, set  apart).    _Ex magnitudine_. _Ex_==secundum, cf. _ex nobilitate_, _ex virtute_ § 7.  _Ex magnitudine_ is predicate after _arbitrantur: they deem it unbecoming  the greatness_, etc.    _Humani--speciem_. Images of the gods existed at a later day in Germany  (S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax., App. to B. 2. cap. 3). But this does not  prove their existence in the days of T. Even as late as A.D. 240 Gregory  Thaumaturgus expressly declares, there were no images among the Goths. No  traces of temple-walls or images have been discovered in connection with  the numerous sites of ancient altars or places of offering which have  been exhumed in _Germany_, though both these are found on the _borders_,  both south and west, cf. Ukert, p. 236.    _Lucos et nemora_. \"Lucus (a [Greek: lukae], crepusculum) sylva densior,  obumbrans; nemus ([Greek: nemos]) sylva rarior, in quo jumenta et pecora  pascuntur.\" Bredow.    _Deorumque--vident. They invoke under the name of gods that mysterious  existence, which they see_ (not under any human or other visible form,  but) _with the eye of spiritual reverence alone_. So Gr. and K. Others  get another idea thus loosely expressed: They give to that sacred recess  the name of the divinity that fills the place, which is never profaned by  the steps of man.    _Sola reverentia_, cf. _sola mente_ applied by T. to the spiritual  religion of the Jews, H. 5, 5. The religion of the Germans and other  northern tribes was more spiritual than that of southern nations, when  both were Pagan. And after the introduction of Christianity, the Germans  were disinclined to the image-worship of the Papists.      X. _Auspicia sortesque_. _Auspicia_ (avis-spicia) properly divination by  observing the flight and cry of birds; _sortes_, by drawing lots: but  both often used in the general sense of omens, oracles.    _Ut qui maxime_, sc. _observant_. Ellipsis supplied by repeating  _observant_==to the greatest extent, none more.    _Simplex_. Sine Romana arte, cf. Cic. de Div. 2, 41, K. The Scythians had  a similar method of divining, Herod. 4, 67. Indeed, the practice of  _divining_ by _rods_ has hardly ceased to this day, among the descendants  of the German Tribes.    _Temere_, without plan on the part of the diviner.--_Fortuito_, under the  direction of chance. Gr.    _Si publice consuletur_. If the question to be decided is of a public  nature. _Consuletur_, fut., because at the time of drawing lots the  deliberation and decision are future. Or it may refer to the consultation  of the gods (cf. Ann. 14, 30: _consulere deos_): _if it is by the state  that the gods are to be consulted_. So Ritter in his last edition.    _Ter singulos tollit_. A three-fold drawing for the sake of certainty.  Thus Ariovistus drew lots three times touching the death of Valerius  (Caes. B.G. 1, 53). So also the Romans drew lots three times, Tibul. 1,  3, 10: sortes ter sustulit. Such is the interpretation of these disputed  words by Grüber, Ritter and many others, and such is certainly their  natural and obvious meaning: _he takes up three times one after another_  all the slips he has _scattered_ (_spargere_ is hardly applicable to  _three_ only): if the signs are twice or thrice favorable, the thing is  permitted; if twice or thrice unfavorable it is prohibited. The language  of Caesar (in loc. cit.) is still more explicit: _ter sortibus  consultum_. But Or., Wr. and Död. understand simply the taking up of  three lots one each time.    _Si prohibuerunt_ sc. sortes==dii. The reading _prohibuerunt_ (aL  prohibuerint) is favored by the analogy of _si displicuit_, 11, and other  passages. _Sin (==si--ne)_ is particularly frequent in antithesis with  _si_, and takes the same construction after it.    _Auspiciorum--exigitur. Auspiciorum_, here some other omens, than lots;  such as the author proceeds to specify. _Adhuc_==ad hoc, praeterea, i.e.  in addition to the lots. The sense is: _besides drawing lots, the  persuasion produced by auspices is required_.    _Etiam hic_. In Germany also (as well as at Rome and other well known  countries). _Hic_ is referred to Rome by some. But it was hardly needful  for T. to inform the Romans of that custom at Rome.    _Proprium gentis. It is a peculiarity of the German race_. It is not,  however, exclusively German. Something similar prevailed among the  Persians, Herod. 1, 189. 7, 55. Darius Hystaspes was indebted to the  neighing of his horse for his elevation to the throne.    _Iisdem memoribus_, § 9.--_Mortali opere_==hominum opere.--_Contacti_.  Notio contaminandi inest, K.--_Pressi curru_. Harnessed to the sacred  chariot. More common, pressi jugo. Poetice.    _Conscios_ sc. deorum. _The priests consider themselves the servants of  the gods, the horses the confidants of the same_. So Tibullus speaks of  the _conscia_ fibra _deorum_. Tibul. 1, 8, 3.    _Committunt_. Con and mitto, send together==_engage in fight_. A  technical expression used of gladiators and champions.    _Praejudicio. Sure prognostic_. Montesquieu finds in this custom the  origin of the duel and of knight-errantry.      XI. _Apud--pertractentur. Are handled_, i.e. discussed, among, i.e. _by  the chiefs_, sc. before being referred to the people.    _Nisi_ refers not to _coeunt_, but to _certis diebus_.    _Fortuitum_, casual, unforeseen; _subitum_, requiring immediate action.    _Inchoatur--impletur_. Ariovistus would not _fight_ before the new moon,  Caes. B.G. 1, 50.    _Numerum--noctium_. Of which custom, we have a relic and a proof in our  seven-_night_ and fort-_night_. So also the Gauls. Caes. B.G. 6, 18.    _Constituunt_==decree, determine; _condicunt_==proclaim, appoint. The  _con_ in both implies _concerted_ or public action. They are forensic  terms.    _Nox--videtur_. So with the Athenians, Macrob. Saturn. 1, 3.; and the  Hebrews, Gen. 1, 5.    _Ex libertate_, sc. _ortum, arising from_. Gün.    _Nec ut jussi. Not precisely at the appointed time_, but a day or two  later, if they choose.    _Ut turbae placuit. Ut_==simul ac, as soon as, _when_. It is the _time of  commencing their session_, that depends on the will of the multitude; not  their sitting _armed_, for that they always did, cf. _frameas concutiunt_  at the close of the section; also § 13: nihil neque publicae neque  privatae rei nisi armati agunt. To express this latter idea, the order of  the words would have been reversed thus: _armati considunt_.    _Tum et coercendi_. When the session is commenced, _then (tum)_ the  priests have the right not merely to command silence, but _also (et) to  enforce it_. This use of _et_ for _etiam_ is very rare in Cic., but  frequent in Livy, T. and later writers. See note, His. 1, 23.    _Imperatur. Imperare_ plus est, quam _jubere_. See the climax in Ter.  Eun. 2, 3, 98; jubeo, cogo atque impero. _Impero_ is properly military  command. K.    _Prout_ refers, not to the order of speaking, but to the degree of  influence they have over the people. Gr.--_Aetas_. Our word _alderman_  (elderman) is a proof, that office and honor were conferred on _age_ by  our German ancestors. So _senator_ (senex) among the Romans.    _Armis laudare_, i.e. armis concussis. \"Montesquieu is of opinion that  in this Treatise on the manners of the Germans, an attentive reader may  trace the origin of the British constitution. That beautiful system, he  says, was formed in the forests of Germany, Sp. of Laws 11, 6. The  _Saxon_ Witena-gemot (Parliament) was, beyond all doubt, an improved  political institution, grafted on the rights exercised by the people in  their own country.\" Murphy, cf. S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax. B. 8. cap. 4      XII. _Accusare--intendere. To accuse and impeach for capital crimes_.  Minor offences were tried before the courts described at the end of the  section.--_Quoque_. In addition to the legislative power spoken of in the  previous section, the council exercised _also_ certain judicial  functions. _Discrimen capitis intendere_, lit. _to endeavor to bring one  in danger of losing his life_.    _Ignavos--infames. The sluggish, the cowardly, and the impure_; for so  _corpore infames_ usually means, and there is no sufficient reason for  adopting another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#19)"],[1,"sembly, he rises and  addresses the chairman by his title, thus:  \"Mr. Chairman,\" who  immediately recognizes him by announcing his name.* [If the chairman has  any special title, as President, for instance, he should be addressed by  it, thus:  \"Mr. President.\"  Sometimes the chairman recognizes the  speaker by merely bowing to him, but the proper course is to announce  his name.] He, then having the floor, says that he \"moves the adoption  of the following resolution,\" which he reads and hands to the chairman.**  [Or, when he is recognized by the chair, he may say that he wishes to  offer the following resolutions, which he reads and then moves their  adoption.] Some one else seconds the motion, and the chairman says, \"It  has been moved and seconded that the following resolution be adopted,\"  when he reads the resolution; or he may read the resolution and then  state the question thus:  \"The question is on the adoption of the  resolution just read.\"  The merits of the resolution are then open to  discussion, but before any member can discuss the question or make any  motion, he must first obtain the floor as just described.  After the  chairman states the question, if no one rises to speak, or when he  thinks the debate closed, he asks, \"Are you ready for the question?\"  If  no one then rises, he puts the question in a form similar to the  following:  \"The question is on the adoption of the resolution    === Page 131 ===========================================================    which you have heard; as many as are in favor of its adoption will say  aye.\"  When the ayes have voted, he says, \"As many as are of a contrary  opinion will say no.\"* [There are many other ways of putting a question;  see Sec. 67, and Rules of Order, Sec. 38.  Other illustrations of the ordinary  practice in introducing business will be seen in Sec.Sec. 46-48.] He then  announces the result, stating that the motion is carried, or lost, as  the case may be, in the following form:  \"The motion is carried--the  resolution is adopted;\" or, \"The ayes have it--the resolution is  adopted.\"  A majority of the votes cast is sufficient for the adoption  of any motion, excepting those mentioned in Sec. 68.    Art. XII.  Motions.    55. Motions Classified According to their Object.  Instead of  immediately adopting or rejecting a resolution as originally submitted,  it may be desirable to dispose of it in some other way, and for this  purpose various motions have come into use, which can be made while a  resolution is being considered, and for the time being, supersede it.  No one can make any of these motions while another member has the floor,    === Page 132 ===========================================================    excepting as shown in Sec. 64, which see for the circumstances under which  each motion can be made.    The following list comprises most of these motions, arranged in eight  classes, according to the object for which each motion is used.  [The  names of the motions are printed in Italics; each class is treated  separately, as shown by the references.]    Motions Classified.      (1) To Amend or Modify ....................................... [Sec. 56]      (a) Amend.      (b) Commit.    (2) To Defer action ..........................................

(b) Adjourn.    56. To Amend or Modify.  (a) Amend.  If it is desired to modify the  question in any way, the proper motion to make is to \"amend,\" either by  \"adding\" words, or by \"striking out\" words; or by \"striking out certain  words and inserting others;\" or by \"substituting\" a different motion on  the same subject for the one before the assembly; or by \"dividing the  question\" into two or more questions, as the mover specifies, so as to  get a separate vote on any particular point or points.  Sometimes the  enemies of a measure seek to amend it in such a way as to divide its  friends, and thus defeat it.    When the amendment has been moved and seconded, the chairman should  always state the question distinctly, so that every one may know exactly  what is before them, reading first the paragraph which it is proposed to  amend; then the words to be struck out, if there are any; next, the  words to be inserted, if any; and finally, the paragraph as it will  stand if the    === Page 134 ===========================================================    amendment is adopted.  He then states that the question is on the  adoption of the amendment, which is open to debate, the remarks being  confined to the merits of the amendment, only going into the main  question so far as is necessary in order to ascertain the propriety of  adopting the amendment.    This amendment can be amended, but an \"amendment of an amendment\" cannot  be amended.  None of the undebatable motions mentioned in Sec. 66, except  to fix the time to which to adjourn, can be amended, nor can the motion  to postpone indefinitely.    (b) Commit.  If the original question is not well digested, or needs  more amendment than can well be made in the assembly, it is usual to  move \"to refer it to a committee.\"  This motion can be made while an  amendment is pending, and it opens the whole merits of the question to  debate.  This motion can be amended by specifying the number of the  committee, or how they shall be appointed, or when they shall report, or  by giving them any other instructions.  [See Sec. 53 on committees, and Sec.  46 (c) on their appointment.]    57. To Defer Action.  (a) Postpone to a certain time.  If it is desired  to defer action    === Page 135 ===========================================================    upon a question till a particular time, the proper motion to make, is to  \"postpone it to that time.\"  This motion allows of but limited debate,  which must be confined to the propriety of the postponement to that  time; it can be amended by altering the time, and this amendment allows  of the same debate.  The time specified must not be beyond that session  [Sec. 70] of the assembly, except it be the next session, in which case it  comes up with the unfinished business at the next session.  This motion  can be made when a motion to amend, or to commit or to postpone  indefinitely, is pending.    (b) Lie on the table.  Instead of postponing a question to a particular  time, it may be desired to lay it aside temporarily until some other  question is disposed of, retaining the privilege of resuming its  consideration at any time.* [In Congress this motion is commonly used to  defeat a measure, though it does not prevent a majority from taking it  at any other time.  Some societies prohibit a question from being taken  from the table, except by a two-thirds vote.  This rule deprives the  society of the advantages of the motion to \"lie on the table.\" because  it would not be safe to lay a question aside temporarily, if one-third  of the assembly were opposed to the measure, as that one-third could  prevent its ever being taken from the table.  A bare majority should not  have the power, in ordinary societies, to adopt or reject a question, or  prevent its consideration, without debate.  [See note at end of Sec. 35,  Rules of Order, on the principles involved in making questions  undebatable.] The only way to accomplish this, is to move that the  question \"lie on the table.\"  This motion    === Page 136 ===========================================================    allowing of neither debate nor amendment, the chairman immediately puts  the question; if carried, the whole matter is laid aside until the  assembly vote to \"take it from the table\" (which latter motion is  undebatable and possesses no privilege).  Sometimes this motion is used  to suppress a measure, as shown in Sec. 59 (c).    58. To Suppress Debate.  (a) Previous Question.  While as a general  rule free debate is allowed upon every motion,* [Except an \"objection to  the consideration of the question\" [Sec. 59 (a)].  See note to Sec. 35, Rules  of Order, for a full discussion of this subject of debate.] which, if  adopted, has the effect of adopting the original question or removing it  from before the assembly for the session,--yet, to prevent a minority  from making an improper use of this privilege, it is necessary to have  methods by which debate can be closed, and final action at once be taken  upon a question.    To accomplish this, when any debatable question is before the assembly,  it is only necessary for some one to obtain the floor and \"call for the  previous question;\" this call being seconded, the chairman, as it allows  of no debate, instantly puts the question, thus:  \"Shall the main  question be now put?\"  If this is carried by a two-thirds vote [Sec. 68],  all debate instantly    === Page 137 ===========================================================    ceases, excepting that the member who offered the original resolution,  or reported it from a committee, is, as"]]]
