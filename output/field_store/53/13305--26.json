Writing for the magazines, again, sounds a delightful  occupation, but literally it means nothing without the co-  operation of the editors of the magazines, and it is this co-  operation which is so difficult to secure. But to earn L600 a  year with the pen is to do a definite thing; if the book could  really tell the secret of that, it would have an enormous sale. I  have not read it, so I cannot say what the secret is. Perhaps it  was only a handbook on forgery.    How to Write for the Press disappointed me. It is concerned not  with the literary journalist (as I believe he is called) but with  the reporter (as he is never called, the proper title being  \"special representative\"). It gives in tabular form a list of the  facts you should ascertain at the different functions you attend;  with this book in your pocket there would be no excuse if you  neglected to find out at a wedding the names of the bride and  bridegroom. It also gives--and I think this is very friendly of  it--a list of useful synonyms for the principal subjects, animate  and inanimate, of description. The danger of calling the  protagonists at the court of Hymen (this one is not from the  book; I thought of it myself just now)--the danger of calling  them \"the happy pair\" more than once in a column is that your  readers begin to suspect that you are a person of extremely  limited mind, and when once they get this idea into their heads  they are not in a proper state to appreciate the rest of your  article. But if in your second paragraph you speak of \"the joyful  couple,\" and in your third of \"the ecstatic brace,\" you give an  impression of careless mystery of the language which can never be  shed away.    Among the many interesting chapters is one dealing with contested  elections. One of the questions to which the special  representative was advised to find an answer was this: \"What  outside bodies are taking active part in the contest?\" In the bad  old days--now happily gone for ever--the outside bodies of dead  cats used to take an active and important part in the contest,  and as the same body would often be used twice the reporter in  search of statistics was placed in a position of great  responsibility. Nowadays, I suppose, he is only meant to concern  himself with such bodies as the Coal Consumers' League and the  Tariff Reform League, and there would be no doubt in the mind of  anybody as to whether they were there or not.    I am afraid I should not be a success as \"our special  representative.\" I should never think of half the things which  occur to the good reporter. You read in your local paper a  sentence like this: \"The bride's brother, who only arrived last  week from Australia, where he held an important post under the  Government, and is about to proceed on a tour through Canada  with--curiously enough--a nephew of the bride-groom, gave her  away.\" Well, what a mass of information has to be gleaned before  that sentence can be written. Or this. \"The hall was packed to  suffocation, and beneath the glare of the electric light--  specially installed for this occasion by Messrs. Ampere & Son of  Pumpton, the building being at ordinary times strikingly  deficient in the matter of artificial lighting in spite of the  efforts of the more progressive members of the town council--the  faces of not a few of the fairer sex could be observed.\" You  know, I am afraid I should have forgotten all that. I should  simply have obtained a copy of the principal speech, and prefaced  it with the words,\" Mr. Dodberry then spoke as follows\"; or, if  my conscience would not allow of such a palpable misstatement,  \"Mr. Dodberry then rose with the intention of speaking as  follows.\"    In the more human art of interviewing I should be equally at  fault. The interview itself would be satisfactory, but I am  afraid that its publication would lead people to believe that all  the best things had been said by me. To remember what anybody  else has said is easy; to remember, even five minutes after, what  one has said oneself is almost impossible. For to recall YOUR  remarks in our argument at the club last night is simply a matter  of memory; to recall MINE, I have to forget all that I meant to  have said, all that I ought to have said, and all that I have  thought upon the subject since.    In fact, I begin to see that the successful reporter must  eliminate his personality altogether, whereas the successful  literary journalist depends for his success entirely upon his  personality --which is what is meant by \"style.\" I suppose it is  for this reason that, when the literary journalist is sent as  \"our extra-special representative\" to report a prize fight or a  final cup tie or a political meeting, the result is always  appalling. The \"ego\" bulges out of every line, obviously  conscious that it is showing us no ordinary reporting, determined  that it will not be overshadowed by the importance of the  subject. And those who are more interested in the matter than in  the manner regard him as an intruder, and the others regret that  he is so greatly overtaxing his strength.    So each to his business, and his handbook to each--How to Write  for the Press to the special representative, and How to Be an  Author to the author. There is no book, I believe, called How to  Be a Solicitor, or a doctor or an admiral or a brewer. That is a  different matter altogether; but any fool can write for the  papers.          Smoking as a Fine Art      My first introduction to Lady Nicotine was at the innocent age of  eight, when, finding a small piece of somebody else's tobacco  lying unclaimed on the ground, I decided to experiment with it.  Numerous desert island stories had told me that the pangs of  hunger could be allayed by chewing tobacco; it was thus that the  hero staved off death before discovering the bread-fruit tree.  Every right-minded boy of eight hopes to be shipwrecked one day,  and it was proper that I should find out for myself whether my  authorities could be trusted in this matter. So I chewed tobacco.  In the sense that I certainly did not desire food for some time  afterwards, my experience justified the authorities, but I felt  at the time that it was not so much for staving off death as for  reconciling oneself to it that tobacco-chewing was to be  recommended. I have never practised it since.    At eighteen I went to Cambridge, and bought two pipes in a case.  In those days Greek was compulsory, but not more so than two  pipes in a case. One of the pipes had an amber stem and the other  a vulcanite stem, and both of them had silver belts. That also  was compulsory. Having bought them, one was free to smoke  cigarettes. However, at the end of my first year I got to work  seriously on a shilling briar, and I have smoked that, or  something like it, ever since.    In the last four years there has grown up a new school of pipe-  smokers, by which (I suspect) I am hardly regarded as a pipe-  smoker at all. This school buys its pipes always at one  particular shop; its pupils would as soon think of smoking a pipe  without the white spot as of smoking brown paper. So far are they  from smoking brown paper that each one of them has his tobacco  specially blended according to the colour of his hair, his taste  in revues, and the locality in which he lives. The first blend is  naturally not the ideal one. It is only when he has been a  confirmed smoker for at least three months, and knows the best  and worst of all tobaccos, that his exact requirements can be  satisfied.    However, it is the pipe rather than the tobacco which marks him  as belonging to this particular school. He pins his faith, not so  much to its labour-saving devices as to the white spot outside,  the white spot of an otherwise aimless life. This tells the world  that it is one of THE pipes. Never was an announcement more  superfluous. From the moment, shortly after breakfast, when he  strikes his first match to the moment, just before bed-time, when  he strikes his hundredth, it is obviously THE pipe which he is  smoking.    For whereas men of an older school, like myself, smoke for the  pleasure of smoking, men of this school smoke for the pleasure of  pipe-owning--of selecting which of their many white-spotted pipes  they will fill with their specially-blended tobacco, of filling  the one so chosen, of lighting it, of taking it from the mouth to  gaze lovingly at the white spot and thus letting it go out, of  lighting it again and letting it go out again, of polishing it up  with their own special polisher and putting it to bed, and then  the pleasure of beginning all over again with another white-  spotted one. They are not so much pipe-smokers as pipe-keepers;  and to have spoken as I did just now of their owning pipes was  wrong, for it is they who are in bondage to the white spot. This  school is founded firmly on four years of war. When at the age of  eighteen you are suddenly given a cheque-book and called \"Sir,\"  you must do something by way of acknowledgment. A pipe in the  mouth makes it clear that there has been no mistake--you are  undoubtedly a man. But you may be excused for feeling after the  first pipe that the joys of smoking have been rated too high, and  for trying to extract your pleasure from the polish on the pipe's  surface, the pride of possessing a special mixture of your own,  and such-like matters, rather than from the actual inspiration  and expiration of smoke. In the same way a man not fond of  reading may find delight in a library of well-bound books. They  are pleasant to handle, pleasant to talk about, pleasant to show  to friends. But it is the man without the library of well-bound  books who generally does most of the reading.    So I feel that it is we of the older school who do most of the  smoking. We smoke unconsciously while we are doing other things;  THEY try, but not very successfully, to do other things while  they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#19)"],[1," open by the men stationed outside even before the authoritative  words, \"Open! in the name of the Republic!\" had echoed along the narrow  corridor.    The sergeant stood at attention and quickly lifted his hand to his  forehead in salute. A fresh squad of some half-dozen men of the  Republican Guard stood in the doorway; they were under the command of an  officer of high rank, a rough, uncouth, almost bestial-looking creature,  with lank hair worn the fashionable length under his greasy  chapeau-bras, and unkempt beard round an ill-washed and bloated face.  But he wore the tricolour sash and badge which proclaimed him one of the  military members of the Sectional Committee of Public Safety, and the  sergeant, who had been so overbearing with the women just now, had  assumed a very humble and even obsequious manner.    \"You sent for a general order to the sectional Committee,\" said the  new-comer, turning abruptly to the sergeant after he had cast a quick,  searching glance round the room, hardly condescending to look on petite  maman and Rosette, whose very souls were now gazing out of their  anguish-filled eyes.    \"I did, citizen commandant,\" replied the sergeant.    \"I am not a commandant,\" said the other curtly. \"My name is Rouget,  member of the Convention and of the Committee of Public Safety. The  sectional Committee to whom you sent for a general order of search  thought that you had blundered somehow, so they sent me to put things  right.\"    \"I am not aware that I committed any blunder, citizen,\" stammered the  sergeant dolefully. \"I could not take the responsibility of making a  domiciliary search all through the house. So I begged for fuller  orders.\"    \"And wasted the Committee's time and mine by such nonsense,\" retorted  Rouget harshly. \"Every citizen of the Republic worthy of the name should  know how to act on his own initiative when the safety of the nation  demands it.\"    \"I did not know--I did not dare--\" murmured the sergeant, obviously  cowed by this reproof, which had been delivered in the rough,  overbearing tones peculiar to these men who, one and all, had risen from  the gutter to places of importance and responsibility in the  newly-modelled State.    \"Silence!\" commanded the other peremptorily. \"Don't waste any more of my  time with your lame excuses. You have failed in zeal and initiative.  That's enough. What else have you done? Have you got the man Lenegre?\"    \"No, citizen. He is not in hiding here, and his wife and daughter will  not give us any information about him.\"    \"That is their look-out,\" retorted Rouget with a harsh laugh. \"If they  give up Lenegre of their own free will the law will deal leniently with  them, and even perhaps with him. But if we have to search the house for  him, then it means the guillotine for the lot of them.\"    He had spoken these callous words without even looking on the two  unfortunate women; nor did he ask them any further questions just then,  but continued speaking to the sergeant:    \"And what about the Englishman? The sectional Committee sent down some  spies this morning to be on the look-out for him on or about this house.  Have you got him?\"    \"Not yet, citizen. But--\"    \"Ah ca, citizen sergeant,\" broke in the other brusquely, \"meseems that  your zeal has been even more at fault than I had supposed. Have you done  anything at all, then, in the matter of Lenegre or the Englishman?\"    \"I have told you, citizen,\" retorted the sergeant sullenly, \"that I  believe Lenegre to be still in this house. At any rate, he had not gone  out of it an hour ago--that's all I know. And I wanted to search the  whole of this house, as I am sure we should have found him in one of the  other apartments. These people are all friends together, and will always  help each other to evade justice. But the Englishman was no concern of  mine. The spies of the Committee were ordered to watch for him, and when  they reported to me I was to proceed with the arrest. I was not set to  do any of the spying work. I am a soldier, and obey my orders when I get  them.\"    \"Very well, then, you'd better obey them now, citizen sergeant,\" was  Rouget's dry comment on the other man's surly explanation, \"for you seem  to have properly blundered from first to last, and will be hard put to  it to redeem your character. The Republic, remember, has no use for  fools.\"    The sergeant, after this covert threat, thought it best, apparently, to  keep his tongue, whilst Rouget continued, in the same aggressive,  peremptory tone:    \"Get on with your domiciliary visits at once. Take your own men with  you, and leave me the others. Begin on this floor, and leave your sentry  at the front door outside. Now let me see your zeal atoning for your  past slackness. Right turn! Quick march!\"    Then it was that petite maman spoke out. She had thought and thought,  and now she knew what she ought to do; she knew that that cruel, inhuman  wretch would presently begin his tramp up and down corridors and stairs,  demanding admittance at every door, entering every apartment. She knew  that the man who had saved her Pierre's life was in hiding somewhere in  the house--that he would be found and dragged to the guillotine, for she  knew that the whole governing body of this abominable Revolution was  determined not to allow that hated Englishman to escape again.    She was old and feeble, small and thin--that's why everyone called her  petite maman--but once she knew what she ought to do, then her spirit  overpowered the weakness of her wizened body.    Now she knew, and even while that arrogant member of an execrated  murdering Committee was giving final instructions to the sergeant,  petite maman said, in a calm, piping voice:    \"No need, citizen sergeant, to go and disturb all my friends and  neighbours. I'll tell you where my husband is.\"    In a moment Rouget had swung round on his heel, a hideous gleam of  satisfaction spread over his grimy face, and he said, with an ugly  sneer:    \"So! you have thought better of it, have you? Well, out with it! You'd  better be quick about it if you want to do yourselves any good.\"    \"I have my daughter to think of,\" said petite maman in a feeble,  querulous way, \"and I won't have all my neighbours in this house made  unhappy because of me. They have all been kind neighbours. Will you  promise not to molest them and to clear the house of soldiers if I tell  you where Lenegre is?\"    \"The Republic makes no promises,\" replied Rouget gruffly. \"Her citizens  must do their duty without hope of a reward. If they fail in it, they  are punished. But privately I will tell you, woman, that if you save us  the troublesome and probably unprofitable task of searching this  rabbit-warren through and through, it shall go very leniently with you  and with your daughter, and perhaps--I won't promise, remember--perhaps  with your husband also.\"    \"Very good, citizen,\" said petite maman calmly. \"I am ready.\"    \"Ready for what?\" he demanded.    \"To take you to where my husband is in hiding.\"    \"Oho! He is not in the house, then?\"    \"No.\"    \"Where is he, then?\"    \"In the Rue Ste. Anne. I will take you there.\"    Rouget cast a quick, suspicious glance on the old woman, and exchanged  one of understanding with the sergeant.    \"Very well,\" he said after a slight pause. \"But your daughter must come  along too. Sergeant,\" he added, \"I'll take three of your men with me; I  have half a dozen, but it's better to be on the safe side. Post your  fellows round the outer door, and on my way to the Rue Ste. Anne I will  leave word at the gendarmerie that a small reinforcement be sent on to  you at once. These can be here in five minutes; until then you are quite  safe.\"    Then he added under his breath, so that the women should not hear: \"The  Englishman may still be in the house. In which case, hearing us depart,  he may think us all gone and try to give us the slip. You'll know what  to do?\" he queried significantly.    \"Of course, citizen,\" replied the sergeant.    \"Now, then, citizeness--hurry up.\"    Once more there was tramping of heavy feet on stone stairs and  corridors. A squad of soldiers of the Republican Guard, with two women  in their midst, and followed by a member of the Committee of Public  Safety, a sergeant, corporal and two or three more men, excited much  anxious curiosity as they descended the steep flights of steps from the  fifth floor.    Pale, frightened faces peeped shyly through the doorways at sound of the  noisy tramp from above, but quickly disappeared again at sight of the  grimy scarlet facings and tricolour cockades.    The sergeant and three soldiers remained stationed at the foot of the  stairs inside the house. Then citizen Rouget roughly gave the order to  proceed. It seemed strange that it should require close on a dozen men  to guard two women and to apprehend one old man, but as the member of  the Committee of Public Safety whispered to the sergeant before he  finally went out of the house: \"The whole thing may be a trap, and one  can't be too careful. The Englishman is said to be very powerful; I'll  get the gendarmerie to send you another half-dozen men, and mind you  guard the house until my return.\"      IV    Five minutes later the soldiers, directed by petite maman, had reached  No. 37 Rue Ste. Anne. The big outside door stood wide open, and the  whole party turned immediately into the house.    The concierge, terrified and obsequious, rushed--trembling--out of his  box.    \"What was the pleasure of the citizen soldiers?\" he asked.    \"Tell him, citizeness,\" commanded Rouget curtly.    \"We are going to apartment No. 12 on the second floor,\" said petite  maman to the concierge.    \"Have you a key of the apartment?\" queried Rouget.    \"No, citizen,\" stammered the concierge, \"but--\"    \"Well, what is it?\" queried the other peremptorily.    \"Papa Turandot is a poor, harmless maker of volins,\" said the concierge.  \"I know him well, though"]]]
