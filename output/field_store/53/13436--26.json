ORIGIN OF CEREALS.--_Cereals,_ which is the term applied to the  edible seeds of certain grains, originated with the civilization of man.  When man lived in a savage state, he wandered about from place to place  and depended for his food on hunting and fishing; but as he ceased his  roaming and began to settle in regions that he found attractive, it was  not long before he became aware of the possibilities of the ground about  him and realized the advantage of tilling the soil as a means of  procuring food. Indeed, the cultivation of the soil for the production  of food may be considered as one of the first steps in his civilization.  Among the foods he cultivated were grains, and from the earliest times  to the present day they have been the main crop and have formed the  chief food of people wherever it is possible to produce them.    The grains belong to the family of grasses, and through cultivation  their seeds, which store the nourishment for the growth of new plants,  have been made to store a sufficient amount of nourishment to permit man  to collect and use it as food. The name cereals was derived from the  goddess Ceres, whom the Romans believed to be the protector of their  crops and harvests. Numerous grains are produced, but only eight of  these cereals are used extensively as food, namely, wheat, corn, oats,  rice, barley, rye, buckwheat, and millet.    2. ABUNDANCE OF PRODUCTION.--With the exception of the desert lands and  the Arctic regions, cereals of some kind are grown over the entire  world. Some varieties thrive in the hot countries, others flourish in  the temperate regions, and still others mature and ripen in the short  warm season of the colder northern climates. In fact, there is  practically no kind of soil that will not produce a crop of some variety  of grain. Since grains are so easily grown and are so plentiful, cereals  and foods made from them furnish a large part of the world's food  supply. Indeed, about one-fourth of all the food eaten by the  inhabitants of the world, when it is considered as a whole, is made up  of cereals.    3. ECONOMIC VALUE OF CEREALS.--The abundance of the world's grain supply  makes the cost so moderate that many of the poorer classes of people in  various countries, especially those in the Far East, live almost  entirely on cereals. Still there is another factor that controls the low  cost of cereals and grains and keeps them within the means of all  classes of people, and that is their excellent keeping quality. They  require very little care and will keep for an indefinite period of time.  Because of their unperishable nature, they may be stored in large  quantities and distributed to consumers as they are needed and at a  price that is fairly uniform.    Since the cost of cereals is moderate, they should form a large  proportion of the diet of the entire family, especially if the family's  income will allow only a limited sum to be spent for food. Some cereals,  of course, are much cheaper than others, and in purchasing this kind of  food the housewife should be governed accordingly. Those which require  an elaborate manufacturing process in their preparation for the market  are the most expensive, but they have an advantage in that they require  practically no preparation before serving. For the varieties that must  be cooked, the cost of preparing the dish, especially if the price of  fuel is high, must be taken into consideration, for unless some thought  is given to the economical use of the fuel, as well as to the method of  cooking employed, the cost of the prepared dish may be greatly  increased. However, in the preparation of cereals, very little skill or  energy is required and a general knowledge of the best methods for one  of them can, as a rule, be applied to all.    4. CEREAL PRODUCTS.--Besides the cereals already mentioned, a number of  products of cereals are extensively used in cookery, chief among them  being flour, corn starch, and other starches. Although every housewife  should possess knowledge of the uses of each of these, instruction in  them is not given until later. This Section includes particularly the  study of grains--whole, cracked, flaked, and those made into grits or  meal--and the use and the serving of them, as well as ready-to-eat  cereals, which are commonly referred to as _breakfast foods._ The only  additional foods to which attention is given at this time are macaroni,  spaghetti, and foods of a similar nature, for as these are made from  wheat they are truly cereal products. In their preparation for the  table, the rules that govern the other cereal foods apply also in a  large measure to them.      COMPOSITION OF CEREALS    5. The composition of all cereals is similar, yet each one has its  distinguishing feature. While all the five food substances--water,  mineral matter, protein, fat, and carbohydrate--are to be found in  cereals, they occur in different quantities in the various kinds. Some  contain large quantities of protein and others practically none, and  while certain ones have considerable fat others possess comparatively  small quantities. A characteristic of all cereals, however, is that they  contain a large amount of carbohydrate and a small amount of water. It  is well to remember, though, that while the food substances of cereals  are found in sufficient quantities to sustain life, they will not permit  a person to live for long periods of time exclusively on this form of  food. Likewise, it will be well to observe that the foods made from a  certain grain will be quite similar in composition to the grain itself;  that is, any change in the composition of the foods must be brought  about by the addition of other substances.    6. All grains are similar in general structure, too. The largest  proportion of carbohydrate lies in the center, this substance growing  less toward the outside of the grain. The protein lies near the outside,  and grows less toward the center. Fat is found in small amounts  scattered through the entire grain, but most of it is found in the  _germ,_ which is a tiny portion of the grain from which the new plant  sprouts. The mineral matter of cereals is found chiefly just inside the  bran, or outer covering, so that when this covering is removed, as in  the process of preparation for food, a certain amount of mineral matter  is generally lost.    7. PROTEIN IN CEREALS.--The cereals are essentially a carbohydrate food,  but some also yield a large proportion of protein. In this respect they  differ from the animal foods that produce the principal supply of  protein for the diet, for these, with the exception of milk, do not  yield carbohydrates. The grain that contains the most protein is wheat,  and in the form in which protein occurs in this cereal it is called  _gluten,_ a substance that is responsible for the hardness of wheat. The  gluten, when the wheat is mixed with water or some other liquid, becomes  gummy and elastic, a fact that accounts for the rubbery consistency of  bread dough. Cereals that contain no gluten do not make bread  successfully. Next to wheat, rye contains protein in the greatest  amount, and rice contains the least. Although protein is the most  expensive of the food substances, the kind of protein found in cereals  is one of the cheaper varieties.    8. FAT IN CEREALS.--The fat of cereals helps to contribute to their  heat-and energy-producing qualities, and, besides, it is one of the  cheaper sources of this food substance. Of the eight grains, or cereals,  used as food, oats and corn contain the most fat, or heat-producing  material. The oil of corn, because of its lack of flavor, is frequently  used in the manufacture of salad oil, cooking oil, and pastry fat. The  fat that occurs in cereals becomes rancid if they are not carefully  stored. In the making of white flour, the germ of the wheat is removed,  and since most of the fat is taken out with the germ, white flour keeps  much better than graham flour, from which the germ is not abstracted in  the milling process.    9. CARBOHYDRATE IN CEREALS.--The food substance found in the greatest  proportion in cereals is carbohydrate in the form of starch. Cereals  contain many times more starch than any of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#19)"],[1,"proportion of  salt, the slower will be the freezing process, for the melting of the  ice takes place more slowly; but the result of this slow freezing is a  finer, smoother texture. Granular, coarse-grained frozen desserts, such  as some sherbets and frappes, are frozen with a large proportion of  salt, which permits the freezing to take place more quickly.    61. On this rapidity in freezing also depends to a large extent the  increase in quantity that takes place in the frozen mixture. Any one who  has had experience in making ice cream knows that the can of the freezer  cannot be filled before the freezing is begun or it will overflow during  the freezing process. Even if it is only two-thirds or three-fourths  full, it will be entirely full when the freezing is completed. This  increase depends somewhat on the kind of mixture, as has been stated, as  well as on the way in which the crank of the freezer is turned, but it  is more largely determined by the proportion of ice and salt and  consequently by the length of time required for the freezing. As can be  readily understood, the more turning that is done, the greater will be  the quantity of air incorporated into the mixture and naturally the more  increase in volume.    62. TABLE SHOWING DETAILS OF FREEZING.--As an aid to the housewife in  the making of frozen desserts, Table I is presented. In it are given the  names of the various kinds of frozen desserts, together with the usual  texture of each, the proportion of ice and salt required to freeze each,  the way in which it freezes, and the increase in volume that can be  expected in each. In trying out the recipes that follow, it will be well  for the housewife to refer to this table for the particular dessert that  she is making, for then she will be able to carry out the freezing more  successfully and will understand what to expect in the finished product.

The preparation of frozen desserts is comparatively simple in  nature, for it usually involves nothing except the cooking of the raw  ingredients and the proper combining of the materials required in the  recipe. Sometimes a custard mixture containing starch is prepared, and  other times a real custard is made. The same rules that apply to the  preparation of these dishes under other conditions should be followed  here. As the housewife is already familiar with these principles, she  will find that there is very little to master about the preparation of  frozen desserts up to the time of freezing. A point that should always  be remembered, however, is that the mixture should be prepared long  enough before the freezing to be entirely cold when it is put into the  freezer, and that, if possible, it should be cooled in a refrigerator.  No trouble will be experienced in preparing enough frozen dessert for  the number that are to be served if it is remembered that 1 quart of  unfrozen mixture will serve six to eight persons when it is frozen.    64. FREEZING THE MIXTURE.--With the preparation of the mixture well  understood, the housewife should turn her attention to the principles  that are involved in its freezing. As has been explained, a can that has  a cover and a bail may sometimes be used, especially if the dessert does  not need turning, but a freezer is necessary for good results in the  preparation of a frozen dessert that requires turning. In the case of  those that need no turning, such as mousses, parfaits, etc., a mold of  some kind or a vacuum freezer is required.    The usual type of freezer consists of a pail, generally wooden, and a  can of smaller size that sets inside of the pail. The space between the  can and the pail is where the ice and salt that freeze the mixture are  packed. The can, which is the container for the mixture, contains a  removable dasher that is turned during the freezing and thus beats air  into the mixture. It is covered with a top that has an opening in the  center through which one end of the dasher extends, and a ring of cogs  surrounding this opening. For the entire freezer there is a top piece  that fastens to both sides of the wooden bucket. It contains a set of  cogs that fit into the cogs on the cover of the can. To one side of this  piece is attached a crank, which, upon being turned, moves both the can  containing the mixture and the dasher inside the can.    65. The first thing to be done in the freezing of any dessert is to get  the ice ready for use. This may be done in numerous ways, but perhaps  the most convenient one is shown in Fig. 7. A bag made of a heavy  material, such as canvas or ticking, and wooden mallet are used for this  purpose. Place the ice in the bag and, as here shown, hold the bag shut  with one hand and pound it with the mallet held in the other. Continue  the pounding until the ice is broken into small pieces, and then empty  it into a dishpan or some other large pan. After the proportion of salt  to ice has been decided upon, mix the salt with the ice in the manner  shown in Fig. 8.    [Illustration: FIG. 7]    [Illustration: FIG. 8]    [Illustration: FIG. 9]    [Illustration: FIG. 10]    66. Before the freezer is used, scald the can and the dasher thoroughly  with boiling water as shown in Fig. 9, and then set them aside to cool.  When entirely cold, fit the can into the freezer, and then, as shown in  Fig. 10, pour the mixture into the can. Remember that the mixture should  come to within only one-third or one-fourth of the top of the can. With  the cover placed securely on the can and the top of the freezer  attached, proceed to pack the ice and salt into the freezer. As shown in  Fig. 11, fill the space between the can and the container with these  materials, using a large spoon for this purpose. Work them down around  the can with the small end of a potato masher or similar implement, as  in Fig. 12, packing the freezer as tightly as possible and making sure  that the ice comes higher than the surface of the mixture inside of  the can.    When the packing has been finished, see that the top is securely  attached and that the hole in the side of the freezer is well stopped  up. Then proceed to freeze the cream. Turn the crank slowly, for nothing  is gained by turning the mixture rapidly at the temperature at which it  is put into the freezer. After the temperature has been reduced  considerably, and just as the mixture begins to thicken a trifle, start  turning the crank more rapidly. The air incorporated just at this time  by the turning of the dasher increases the volume considerably, for it  will remain held in the mixture.    [Illustration: FIG. 11]    [Illustration: FIG. 12]    67. PACKING THE MIXTURE.--If the frozen dessert is to be served at once,  turn the crank until it is difficult to turn any longer. However, in  case the dessert is not to be used as soon as it is made, it should be  frozen only moderately hard and then packed and allowed to freeze more.  During this second freezing process, a condition occurs that is known as  _ripening_ and that improves the quality as well as the flavor of the  dessert. After the freezing has been carried on to the desired degree,  unfasten the top of the freezer, wipe the can thoroughly around the top  with a cloth to make sure that all salt and ice are removed, and then  remove the cover. Proceed at once to lift out the dasher and to scrape  it clean with a knife or a spoon, as shown in Fig. 13. Push down the  frozen dessert in the can carefully and tightly with the aid of a spoon.  To prepare it for packing, stretch a piece of waxed paper over the top  of the can, replace the cover, and fit a cork into the hole in the cover  through which the top of the dasher extends, as Fig. 14 shows. With this  done, remove the stopper from the hole in the side of the freezer and,  as Fig. 15 shows, run off the brine that has formed by the melting of  the ice. Then repack the freezer with a mixture of ice and salt in the  proportion of 2 to 1 and set aside until needed.    [Illustration: FIG. 13]    [Illustration: FIG. 14]    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    68. USING A VACUUM FREEZER.--There are some frozen desserts that do not  necessarily require the incorporation of air by means of a dasher to be  satisfactory. For desserts of this kind, a vacuum freezer, that is, one  that requires no turning, may be used.    In such a freezer a container extends down through the center of the can  and is surrounded by an air space. The mixture to be frozen is poured  into this container from the top and the ice-and-salt mixture that does  the freezing is put in from the bottom and takes up the air space.  Covers fasten securely both the top and the bottom. A handle attached to  one side makes the handling of such a freezer an easy matter.    By many, a freezer of this kind is considered a decided advantage over  the usual variety of freezer, for it requires no turning, but there are  certain disadvantages about its use that should be understood before one  is secured."]]]
