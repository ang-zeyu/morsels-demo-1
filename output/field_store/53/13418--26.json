While they were doing this, the King sat on a seat of green rushes,  over which was spread a flame-colored satin cover, with a cushion like  it, for his elbow to rest upon.    In the evening, the harpers and singers made music, the bards recited  poetry, or the good story tellers told tales of heroes and wonders.  During all this time, one or more maidens held the king's feet, or  took turns at it, when tired; for often the revels or songs and tales  lasted far into the night. At intervals, if the story was dull, or he  had either too much dinner, or had been out hunting and got tired, His  Majesty took a nap, with his feet resting upon the lap of a pretty  maiden. This happened often in the late hours, while they were getting  the liquid refreshments ready.    Then the king's chamberlain gently nudged him, to be wideawake, and he  again enjoyed the music, and the stories, while his feet were held.    For, altogether, it was great fun.    Now there was once a Prince of Gwynedd, in Wales, named Math, who was  so fond of having his feet held, that he neglected to govern his  people properly. He spent all his time lounging in an easy chair,  while a pretty maiden held his heels and toes. He committed all public  cares to two of his nephews. These were named for short, Gily and  Gwyd.    The one whom the king loved best to have her hold his feet was the  fairest maiden in all the land, and she was named Goewen.    By and by, the prince grew so fond of having his feet held, and  stroked and patted and played with, by Goewen, that he declared that  he could not live, unless Goewen held his feet. And, she said, that if  she did not hold the king's feet, she would die.    Now this Gily, one of the king's nephews, son of Don, whom he had  appointed to look day by day after public affairs, would often be in  the hall at night. He listened to the music and stories, and seeing  Goewen, the king's foot holder, he fell in love with her. His eye  usually wandered from the story teller to the lovely girl holding the  king's feet, and he thought her as beautiful as an angel.    Soon he became so lovesick, that he felt he would risk or give his  life to get and have her for his own. But what would the king say?    Besides, he soon found out that the maiden Goewen cared nothing for  him.    Nevertheless the passion of the love-lorn youth burned hotly and kept  increasing. He confided his secret to his brother Gwyd, and asked his  aid, which was promised. So, one day, the brother went to King Math,  and begged for leave to go to Pryderi. In the king's name, he would  ask from him the gift of a herd of swine of famous breed; which, in  the quality of the pork they furnished, excelled all other pigs known.  They were finer than any seen in the land, or ever heard of before.  Their flesh was said to be sweeter, juicier, and more tender than the  best beef. Even their manners were better than those of some men.    In fact, these famous pigs were a present from the King of Fairyland.  So highly were they prized, that King Math doubted much whether his  nephew could get them at any price.    In ancient Wales the bards and poet singers were welcomed, and trusted  above all men; and this, whether in the palace or the cottage.    So Gwyd, the brother of the love-sick one, in order to get the herd of  surpassing swine, took ten companions, all young men and strong,  dressed as bards, and pretending by their actions to be such. Then  they all started out together to seek the palace of Pryderi.    Having arrived, they were entertained at a great feast, in the castle  hall. There Pryderi sat on his throne-chair, with his feet in a  maiden's lap.    The dinner over, Gwyd was asked to tell a story.    This he did, delighting everyone so much, that he was voted a jolly  good fellow by all. In fact, Pryderi felt ready to give him anything  he might demand, excepting always his foot holder.    At once, Gwyd made request to give him the herd of swine.    At this, the countenance of Pryderi fell, for he had made a promise to  his people, that he would not sell or give away the swine, until they  had produced double their number in the land; for there were no pigs  and no pork like theirs, to be bought anywhere.    Now this Gwyd was not very cunning, but he had the power of using  magic arts. By these, he could draw the veil of illusion over both the  mind and the eyes of the people.    So he made answer to Pryderi's objections thus:    \"Keep your promise to your people, oh, most honored Pryderi, and only  exchange them for the gift I make thee,\" said Gwyd.    Thereupon, exerting his powers of magic, he created the illusion of  twelve superb horses. These were all saddled, bridled, and  magnificently caparisoned. But, after twenty-four hours, they would  vanish from sight. The illusion would be over.    With these steeds, so well fitted for hunting, were twelve sleek,  fleet hounds. Taken altogether, here was a sight to make a hunter's  eyes dance with delight.    So Pryderi gave Gwyd the swine, and he quickly drove them off.    \"For,\" he whispered to his companion fellows in knavery, \"the illusion  will only last until the same hour to-morrow.\"    And so it happened. For when Pryderi's men went to the stables, to  groom the horses and feed the hounds, there was nothing in either the  stables or the kennels.    When they told this to Pryderi, he at once blew his horn and assembled  his knights, to invade the country of Gwynedd, to recover his swine.  Hearing of his coming, King Math went out to meet Pryderi in battle.    But while he was away with his army, Gily, the lover, seized the  beautiful maiden Goewen, who held the king's feet in her lap.    She was not willing to marry Gily, but he eloped with her, and carried  her off to his cottage.    The war which now raged was finally decided by single combat, as was  the custom in old days. By this, the burning of the peasants' houses,  and the ruin which threatened the whole country, ended, and peace  came.    It was not alone by the strength and fierceness of King Math, but also  by the magic spells of Gwyd, that Pryderi was slain.    After burying the hero, King Math came back to his palace and found  out what Gily had done. Then he took Goewen away from Gily, and to  make amends for her trouble, in being thus torn from his palace, King  Math made her his queen. Then the lovely Goewen shared his throne  covered with the flame colored satin. One of the most beautiful  maidens of the court was chosen to hold his feet, until such time as a  permanent choice was made.    As for the two nephews, who had fled from the wrath of their princely  uncle, they were put under bans, as outlaws, and had to live on the  borders of the kingdoms. No one of the king's people was allowed to  give them food or drink. Yet they would not obey the summons of the  king, to come and receive their punishment.    But at last, tired of being deserted by all good men and women, they  repented in sorrow. Hungry, ragged and forlorn, they came to their  uncle, the king to submit themselves to be punished.    When they appeared, Math spoke roughly to them, and said:    \"You cannot make amends for the shame you have brought upon me. Yet,  since you obey and are sorry, I shall punish you for a time and then  pardon you. You are to do penance for three years at least.\"    Then they were changed into wild deer, and he told them to come back  after twelve months.    At the end of the year they returned, bringing with them a young fawn.    As this creature was entirely innocent, it was given a human form and  baptized in the church.    But the two brothers were changed into wild swine, and driven off to  find their food in the forest.    At the end of the year, they came back with a young pig.    The king had the little animal changed into a human being, which, like  every mother's child in that time, received baptism.    Again the brothers were transformed into animal shape. This time, as  wolves, and were driven out to the hills.    At the end of a twelve months' period, they came back, three in  number, for one was a cub.    By this time, the penance of the naughty nephews was over, and they  were now to be delivered from all magic spells.    So their human nature was restored to them, but they must be washed  thoroughly. In the first place, it took much hot water and lye, made  from the wood ashes, and then a great deal of scrubbing, to make them  presentable.    Then they were anointed with sweet smelling oil, and the king ordered  them to be arrayed in elegant apparel. They were appointed to hold  honorable office at court, and from time to time to go out through the  country, to call the officers to attend to public business.    When the time came that the king sought for one of the most beautiful  maidens, who should hold his feet, Gwyd nominated to the prince's  notice his sister Arianrod. The king was gracious, and thereafter she  held his feet at all the banquets. She was looked up to with reverence  by all, and held the office for many years. Thus King Math's  reputation for grace and mercy was confirmed.          XIX      POWELL, PRINCE OF DYFED      One of the oldest of the Welsh fairy tales tells us about Pwyle, King  of Fairyland and father of the numerous clan of the Powells. He was a  mighty hunter. He could ride a horse, draw a bow, and speak the truth.  He was always honored by men, and he kept his faith and his promises  to women. The children loved him, for he loved them. In the castle  hall, he could tell the best stories. No man, bard, or warrior, foot  holder or commoner, could excel him in gaining and keeping the  attention of his hearers, even when they were sleepy and wanted to go  to bed.    One day, when out a hunting in the woods, he noticed a pack of hounds  running down a stag. He saw at once that they were not his own, for  they were snow white in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#19)"],[1,"       on the temples of terror,    Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who        is dumb as the dust-heaps of death:    Surely no soul is it, sweet as the spasm of erotic emotional        exquisite error,    Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss, beatific itself by        beatitude's breath.    Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit        and soul of our senses    Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the        semblance and sound of a sigh;    Only this oracle opens Olympian, in mystical moods and       triangular tenses--    Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the        dawn of the day when we die.    Mild is the mirk and monotonous music of memory melodiously mute        as it may be,    While the hope in the heart of a hero is bruised by the breach of        men's rapiers resigned to the rod;    Made meek as a mother whose bosom--beats bound with the bliss--        bringing bulk of a balm--breathing baby,    As they grope through the grave-yards of creeds, under skies        growing green'at a groan for the grimness of God.    Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old and its binding        is blacker than bluer:    Out of blue into black is the scheme of the skies, and their        dews are the wine of the bloodshed of things;    Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that        is freed from the fangs that pursue her,    Till the heart-beats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the        hunt that has harried the kernel of kings.                              _A. C. Swinburne,                               in \"The Heptalogia_.\"        _MARTIN LUTHER AT POTSDAM_      What lightning shall light it? What thunder shall tell it?    In the height of the height, in the depth of the deep?      Shall the sea--storm  declare it, or paint it, or smell it?        Shall the price of a slave be its treasure to keep?    When the night has grown near with the gems on her bosom,        When the white of mine eyes is the whiteness of snow,    When the cabman--in liquor--drives a blue roan, a kicker,        Into the land of the dear long ago.      Ah!--Ah, again!--You will come to me, fall on me--        You are _so_ heavy, and I am _so_ flat.    And I? I shall not be at home when you call on me,        But stray down the wind like a gentleman's hat:    I shall list to the stars when the music is purple,        Be drawn through a pipe, and exhaled into rings;    Turn to sparks, and then straightway get stuck in the gateway        That stands  between speech and unspeakable things.      As I mentioned before, by what light is it lighted?        Oh! Is it fourpence, or piebald, or gray?    Is it a mayor that a mother has knighted,        Or is it a horse of the sun and the day?    Is it a pony? If so, who will change it?        O golfer, be quiet, and mark where it scuds,    And think of its paces--of owners and races--        Relinquish the links for the study of studs.      Not understood? Take me hence! Take me yonder!        Take me away to the land of my rest--    There where the Ganges and other gees wander,        And uncles and antelopes act for the best,    And all things are mixed and run into each other        In a violet twilight of virtues and sins,    With the church-spires below you and no one to show you        Where the curate leaves off and the pew-rent begins!      In the black night through the rank grass the snakes peer--        The cobs and the cobras are partial to grass--    And a boy wanders out with a knowledge of Shakespeare        That's not often found in a boy of his class,    And a girl wanders out without any knowledge,        And a bird wanders out, and a cow wanders out,    Likewise one wether, and they wander together--        There's a good deal of wandering lying about.      But it's all for the best; I've been told by my friends, Sir,        That in verses I'd written the meaning was slight;    I've tried with no meaning--to make 'em amends, Sir--        And find that this kind's still more easy to write.    The title has nothing to do with the verses,        But think of the millions--the laborers who    In busy employment find deepest enjoyment,        And yet, like my title, have nothing to do!                              _Barry Pain_.          _COMPANIONS_      I know not of what we ponder'd        Or made pretence to talk,    As, her hand within mine, we wander'd        Tow'rd the pool by the limetree walk,    While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers        And the blush-rose bent on her stalk.      I cannot recall her figure:        Was it regal as Juno's own?    Or only a trifle bigger        Than the elves who surround the throne    Of the Faëry Queen, and are seen, I ween,        By mortals in dreams alone?      What her eyes were like, I know not:        Perhaps they were blurred with tears;    And perhaps in your skies there glow not        (On the contrary) clearer spheres.    No as to her eyes I am just as wise        As you or the cat, my dears.      Her teeth, I presume, were \"pearly\":        But which was she, brunette or blonde?    Her hair, was it quaintly curly,        Or as straight as a beadle's wand?    That I failed to remark;--it was rather dark        And shadowy round the pond.      Then the hand that reposed so snugly        In mine--was it plump or spare?    Was the countenance fair or ugly?        Nay, children, you have me there!    My eyes were p'raps blurr'd; and besides, I'd heard        That it's horribly rude to stare.      And I--was I brusque and surly?        Or oppressively bland and fond?    Was I partial to rising early?        Or why did we twain abscond,    All breakfastless too, from the public view        To prowl by a misty pond?      What passed, what was felt or spoken--        Whether anything passed at all--    And whether the heart was broken        That beat under that sheltering shawl--    (If shawl she had on, which I doubt)--has gone.        Yes, gone from me past recall.      Was I haply the lady's suitor?        Or her uncle? I can't make out--    Ask your governess, dears, or tutor.        For myself, I'm in hopeless doubt    As to why we were there, and who on earth we were,        And what this is all about.                              _C. S. Calverley_.          _THE COCK AND THE BULL_      You see this pebble-stone? It's a thing I bought    Of a bit of a chit of a boy i' the mid o' the day--    I like to dock the smaller parts-o-speech,    As we curtail the already cur-tailed cur    (You catch the paronomasia, play 'po' words?)    Did, rather, i' the pre-Landseerian days.    Well, to my muttons. I purchased the concern,    And clapt it i' my poke, having given for same    By way o' chop, swop, barter or exchange--    \"Chop\" was my snickering dandiprat's own term--    One  shilling  and  fourpence, current coin o' the realm.    O-n-e one and f-o-u-r four    Pence, one and fourpence--you are with me, sir?--    What hour it skills not: ten or eleven o' the clock,    One day (and what a roaring day it was    Go shop or sight-see--bar a spit o' rain!)    In February, eighteen sixty nine,    Alexandrina Victoria, Fidei,    Hm--hm--how runs the jargon? being on the throne.      Such, sir, are all the facts, succinctly put,    The basis or substratum--what you will--    Of the impending eighty thousand lines.    \"Not much in 'em either,\" quoth perhaps simple Hodge.    But there's a superstructure. Wait a bit.      Mark first the rationale of the thing:    Hear logic rivel and levigate the deed.    That shilling--and for matter o' that, the pence--    I had o' course upo' me--wi' me say--    (_Mecum's_ the Latin, make a note o' that)    When I popp'd pen i' stand, scratched ear, wiped snout,    (Let everybody wipe his own himself)    Sniff'd--tch!--at snuffbox; tumbled up, he-heed,    Haw-haw'd (not he-haw'd, that's another guess thing):    Then fumbled at, and stumbled out of, door,    I shoved the timber ope wi' my omoplat;    And _in vestibulo_, i' the lobby to-wit,    (Iacobi Facciolati's rendering, sir,)    Donned galligaskins, antigropeloes,    And so forth; and, complete with hat and gloves,    One on and one a-dangle i' my hand,    And ombrifuge (Lord love you!) cas o' rain,    I flopped forth, 'sbuddikins! on my own ten toes,    (I do assure you there be ten of them)    And went clump-clumping up hill and down dale    To find myself o' the sudden i' front o' the boy.    Put case I hadn't 'em on me, could I ha' bought    This sort-o'-kind-o'-what-you-might-call-toy,    This pebble-thing, o' the boy-thing? Q. E. D.    That's proven without aid for mumping Pope,    Sleek porporate or bloated cardinal.    (Isn't it, old Fatchops? You're in Euclid now.)    So, having the shilling--having i' fact a lot--    And pence and halfpence, ever so many o' them,    I purchased, as I think I said before,    The pebble (_lapis, lapidis, di, dem, de_--    What nouns 'crease short i' the genitive,  Fatchops, eh?)    O the boy, a bare-legg'd beggarly son of a gun,    For one-and-fourpence. Here we are again.    Now Law steps in, biwigged, voluminous-jaw'd;    Investigates and re-investigates.    Was the transaction illegal? Law shakes head.    Perpend, sir, all the bearings of the case.      At first the coin was mine, the chattel his.    But now (by virtue of the said exchange    And barter) _vice versa_ all the coin,    _Rer juris operationem_, vests    I' the boy and his assigns till ding o' doom;    _In saecula saeculo-o-o-orum_;    (I think I hear the Abate mouth out that.)    To have and hold the same to him and them ...    Confer some idiot on Conveyancing.    Whereas the pebble and every part thereof,    And all that appertaineth thereunto,    _Quodcunque pertinet ad em rem_,    (I fancy, sir, my Latin's rather pat)    Or shall, will, may, might, can, could, would, or should,    _Subaudi caetera_-"]]]
