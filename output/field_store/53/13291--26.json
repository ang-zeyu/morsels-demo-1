At that instant the word--the odious word--\"infamous\" rang in her ears,  and her face paled. He noticed the sudden pallor, and his eyes grew  dark with earnest questioning.    \"I see,\" he said, quietly, \"you will not come!\"    What was it that moved her? With a sudden impulse she raised her eyes  and looked at him steadily.    \"Yes, I will come!\" she said.    He inclined his head without a word, called to the dogs, and passed out.    Stella stood for a moment looking after them; then she went into the  kitchen--not laughing nor singing, but with a strange gravity; a  strange feeling had got possession of her.    She felt as if she was laboring under some spell. \"Charmed\" is an often  misused word, but it is the right word to describe the sensation.  Was it his face or his voice that haunted her? As she stood absently  looking down at the table, simple words, short and commonplace, which  he had used rang in her ears with a new meaning.    Mrs. Penfold stood and regarded her in curious astonishment. She was  getting used to Stella's quickly changing moods, but the sudden change  bewildered her.    \"Let me do it, Miss Stella,\" she pleaded, but Stella shook her head  firmly; not by one inch would she swerve from her cause for all the  beautiful voice and noble face.    In rapt silence she finished her work, then she went up-stairs and put  on her hat and came down. As she passed out of the house and down the  path, the mastiff leaped the gate and bounded toward her, and the next  moment she saw Lord Leycester seated on a stile.    He dropped down and came toward her.    \"How quick you have been,\" he said, \"I thought a pudding was a mystery  which demanded an immensity of time.\"    Stella looked up at him, her dark brows drawn to a straight line.    \"You waited for me?\" she said.    \"No,\" he said, simply, \"I came back. I did not like to think that you  should come alone.\"    Stella was silent.    \"Are you angry?\" he asked, in a low voice.    Stella was silent for a moment, then she looked at him frankly.    \"No,\" she said.    If she had but said \"yes,\" and turned back! But the path, all beautiful  with the bright coloring of Spring stretched before her, and she had  no thought of turning back, no thought or suspicion of the dark and  perilous land toward which she was traveling by his side.    Already the glamour of love was falling upon her like the soft mist of  a Summer evening; blindly, passively she was moving toward the fate  which the gods had prepared for her.          CHAPTER VII.      Side by side they walked across the meadows; the larks rising before  them and soaring up to the heavens with a burst of song; the river  running in silvery silence to the sea; the green trees waving gently in  the Summer breeze; and above them the long stretching gray masonry of  Wyndward Hall.    Lord Leycester was strangely silent for some minutes since that \"Are  you angry?\" and Stella, as she walked by his side, stooping now and  again to gather a cowslip, glanced up at his face and wondered whether  her uncle could be mistaken, whether they were not all deceived in  thinking the quiet, graceful creature with the beautiful face and  dreamy, almost womanly, soft eyes, wild and reckless, and desperate and  altogether bad. She almost forgot how she had seen him on that first  night of their meeting, with his whip upraised and the sudden fire of  anger in his eyes.    Presently he spoke, so suddenly that Stella, who had been lost in her  speculations respecting him, started guiltily:    \"I have been wondering,\" he said, \"how Mr. Etheridge takes the change  which your presence must make in the cottage.\"    Stella looked up with surprise, then she smiled.    \"He bears it with admirable resignation,\" she said, with that air of  meek archness which her uncle found so amusing.    Lord Leycester looked down at her.    \"That is a rebuke for the presumption of my remark?\" he said.    \"No,\" said Stella.    \"I did not mean to be presumptuous. Think. Your uncle has lived the  whole of his life alone, the life of a solitary, a hermit; suddenly  there enters into that life a young and beau--a young girl, full of the  spirit of youth and its aspirations. It must make a great change.\"    \"As I said,\" says Stella, \"he bears it with pious fortitude.\" Then she  added, in a lower voice, \"He is very good to me.\"    \"He could not be otherwise,\" was the quiet response. \"I mean that he  could not be anything but good, gentle, and loving with any living  thing. I have known him since I was a boy,\" he added. \"He was always  the same, always living a life of dreams. I wonder whether he takes you  as a dream?\"    \"A very substantial and responsible one, then,\" said Stella, with her  little laugh. \"One that lasts through the daytime.\"    He looked at her with that strange intent look which she had learned  that she could not meet.    \"And you?\" he said.    \"I?\" said Stella, though she knew what he meant.    He nodded.    \"How do you like the change?--this still, quiet life in the Thames  valley. Are you tired of it already? Will you pine for all the gayeties  you have left?\"    Stella looked up at him--his eyes were still fixed on hers.    \"I have left no gayeties,\" she said. \"I left a bare and horrid school  that was as unlike home as the desert of Sahara is like this lovely  meadow. How do I feel? As if I had been translated to Paradise--as if  I, who was beginning to think that I was alone in the world I had no  business to be in, had found some one friend to love----\"    She paused, and he, glancing at the black waistband to her white dress,  said, with the tenderest, most humble voice:    \"I beg your pardon. Will you forgive me?--I did not know----\"    And his voice broke.    Stella looked up at him with a smile shining through the unshed tears.    \"How--why should you know? Yes, I was quite alone in the world. My  father died a year ago.\"    \"Forgive me,\" he murmured; and he laid his hand with a feather's weight  on her arm. \"I implore you to forgive me. It was cruel and thoughtless.\"    \"No,\" said Stella. \"How should you know?\"    \"If I had been anything better than an unthinking brute, I might have  guessed.\"    There was a moment's pause, then Stella spoke.    \"Yes, it is Paradise. I had no idea England was like this, they called  it the land of fogs.\"    \"You have not seen London on a November evening,\" he said, with a  laugh. \"Most foreigners come over to England and put up at some hotel  at the west-end, and judge the whole land by the London sample--very  few come even so far as this. You have not been to London?\"    \"I passed through it,\" said Stella, \"that is all. But I heard a great  deal about it last night,\" she added, with a smile.    \"Yes!\" he said, with great interest--\"last night?\"    \"Yes, at Mrs. Hamilton's. She was kind enough to ask me to an evening  party, and one of the guests took great pains to impress me with the  importance and magnificence of London.\"    He looked at her.    \"May I ask who she was?\" he said.    \"It was not a she, but a gentleman. It was Mr. Adelstone.\"    Lord Leycester thought a moment.    \"Adelstone. Adelstone. I don't know him.\"    Before she was quite aware of it the retort slipped from her lips.    \"He knows you.\"    He looked at her with a thoughtful smile.    \"Does he? I don't remember him. Stay, yes, isn't he a relation of Mr.  Fielding's?\"    \"His nephew,\" said Stella, and feeling the dark, penetrating eyes on  her she blushed faintly. It annoyed her, and she struggled to suppress  it, but the blush came and he saw it.    \"I remember him now,\" he said; \"a tall, thin dark man. A lawyer, I  believe. Yes, I remember him. And he told you about London?\"    \"Yes,\" said Stella, and as she remembered the conversation of a few  hours ago, her color deepened. \"He is very amusing and well-informed,  and he took pity on my ignorance in the kindest way. I was very  grateful.\"    There was something in her tone that made him look at her questioningly.    \"I think,\" he said, \"your gratitude is easily earned.\"    \"Oh, no,\" she retorted; \"I am the most ungrateful of beings. Isn't that  uncle sitting there?\" she added, quickly, to change the subject.    He looked up.    \"Yes, he is hard at work. I did not think I should have won him. It was  my sister's name that worked the magic charm.\"    \"He is fond of your sister,\" said Stella, thoughtfully.    His eyes were on her in an instant.    \"He has spoken of her?\" he said.    Stella could have bitten her tongue out for the slip.    \"Yes,\" she said. \"He--he told me about her--I asked him whose house it  was upon the hills.\"    \"Meaning the Hall?\" he said, pointing with his whip.    \"Yes, and he told me. I knew by the way he spoke of your sister that he  was fond of her. Her name is Lilian, is it not?\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"Lilian,\" and the name left his lips with soft  tenderness. \"I think every one who knows her loves her. This picture is  for her.\"    Stella glanced up at his face; anything less imperious at that moment  it would be impossible to imagine.    \"Lady Lilian is fond of pictures?\" she said.    \"Yes,\" he said; \"she is devoted to art in all its forms. Yes, that  little sketch will give her more pleasure than--than--I scarcely know  what to say. What are women most fond of?\"    Stella laughed.    \"Diamonds, are they not?\"    \"Are you fond of them?\" he said. \"I think not.\"    \"Why not?\" she retorted. \"Why should I not have the attributes of my  sex? Yes, I am fond of diamonds. I am fond of everything that is  beautiful and costly and rare. I remember once going to a ball at  Florence.\"    He looked at her.    \"Only to see it!\" she exclaimed. \"I was too young to be seen, and  they took me in a gallery overlooking the great salon; and I watched  the great ladies in their beautiful dresses and shining"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5342"],[0,"The Story Girl (#19)"],[1," the bread baked. I  got up at three, and it was lovely and light, so I just gave it a right  good kneading and popped it into the oven. And it's all done and out of  the way. But the loaves don't seem quite as big as they should be,\" she  added doubtfully.    \"Sara Stanley!\" Felicity flew across the kitchen. \"Do you mean that you  put the bread right into the oven after you kneaded it without leaving  it to rise a second time?\"    The Story Girl turned quite pale.    \"Yes, I did,\" she faltered. \"Oh, Felicity, wasn't it right?\"    \"You've ruined the bread,\" said Felicity flatly. \"It's as heavy as a  stone. I declare, Sara Stanley, I'd rather have a little common sense  than be a great story teller.\"    Bitter indeed was the poor Story Girl's mortification.    \"Don't tell Uncle Roger,\" she implored humbly.    \"Oh, I won't tell him,\" promised Felicity amiably. \"It's lucky there's  enough old bread to do to-day. This will go to the hens. But it's an  awful waste of good flour.\"    The Story Girl crept out with Felix and me to the morning orchard, while  Dan and Peter went to do the barn work.    \"It isn't ANY use for me to try to learn to cook,\" she said.    \"Never mind,\" I said consolingly. \"You can tell splendid stories.\"    \"But what good would that do a hungry boy?\" wailed the Story Girl.    \"Boys ain't ALWAYS hungry,\" said Felix gravely. \"There's times when they  ain't.\"    \"I don't believe it,\" said the Story Girl drearily.    \"Besides,\" added Felix in the tone of one who says while there is life  there is yet hope, \"you may learn to cook yet if you keep on trying.\"    \"But Aunt Olivia won't let me waste the stuff. My only hope was to learn  this week. But I suppose Felicity is so disgusted with me now that she  won't give me any more lessons.\"    \"I don't care,\" said Felix. \"I like you better than Felicity, even if  you can't cook. There's lots of folks can make bread. But there isn't  many who can tell a story like you.\"    \"But it's better to be useful than just interesting,\" sighed the Story  Girl bitterly.    And Felicity, who was useful, would, in her secret soul, have given  anything to be interesting. Which is the way of human nature.    Company descended on us that afternoon. First came Aunt Janet's sister,  Mrs. Patterson, with a daughter of sixteen years and a son of two. They  were followed by a buggy-load of Markdale people; and finally, Mrs.  Elder Frewen and her sister from Vancouver, with two small daughters of  the latter, arrived.    \"It never rains but it pours,\" said Uncle Roger, as he went out to take  their horse. But Felicity's foot was on her native heath. She had been  baking all the afternoon, and, with a pantry well stocked with biscuits,  cookies, cakes, and pies, she cared not if all Carlisle came to tea.  Cecily set the table, and the Story Girl waited on it and washed all the  dishes afterwards. But all the blushing honours fell to Felicity, who  received so many compliments that her airs were quite unbearable for  the rest of the week. She presided at the head of the table with as much  grace and dignity as if she had been five times twelve years old, and  seemed to know by instinct just who took sugar and who took it not. She  was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and was so pretty that I could  hardly eat for looking at her--which is the highest compliment in a  boy's power to pay.    The Story Girl, on the contrary, was under eclipse. She was pale and  lustreless from her disturbed night and early rising; and no opportunity  offered to tell a melting tale. Nobody took any notice of her. It was  Felicity's day.    After tea Mrs. Frewen and her sister wished to visit their father's  grave in the Carlisle churchyard. It appeared that everybody wanted to  go with them; but it was evident that somebody must stay home with Jimmy  Patterson, who had just fallen sound asleep on the kitchen sofa. Dan  finally volunteered to look after him. He had a new Henty book which he  wanted to finish, and that, he said, was better fun than a walk to the  graveyard.    \"I think we'll be back before he wakes,\" said Mrs. Patterson, \"and  anyhow he is very good and won't be any trouble. Don't let him go  outside, though. He has a cold now.\"    We went away, leaving Dan sitting on the door-sill reading his book, and  Jimmy P. snoozing blissfully on the sofa. When we returned--Felix and  the girls and I were ahead of the others--Dan was still sitting in  precisely the same place and attitude; but there was no Jimmy in sight.    \"Dan, where's the baby?\" cried Felicity.    Dan looked around. His jaw fell in blank amazement. I never saw any one  look as foolish as Dan at that moment.    \"Good gracious, I don't know,\" he said helplessly.    \"You've been so deep in that wretched book that he's got out, and dear  knows where he is,\" cried Felicity distractedly.    \"I wasn't,\" cried Dan. \"He MUST be in the house. I've been sitting right  across the door ever since you left, and he couldn't have got out unless  he crawled right over me. He must be in the house.\"    \"He isn't in the kitchen,\" said Felicity rushing about wildly, \"and he  couldn't get into the other part of the house, for I shut the hall door  tight, and no baby could open it--and it's shut tight yet. So are all  the windows. He MUST have gone out of that door, Dan King, and it's your  fault.\"    \"He DIDN'T go out of this door,\" reiterated Dan stubbornly. \"I know  that.\"    \"Well, where is he, then? He isn't here. Did he melt into air?\" demanded  Felicity. \"Oh, come and look for him, all of you. Don't stand round like  ninnies. We MUST find him before his mother gets here. Dan King, you're  an idiot!\"    Dan was too frightened to resent this, at the time. However and wherever  Jimmy had gone, he WAS gone, so much was certain. We tore about the  house and yard like maniacs; we looked into every likely and unlikely  place. But Jimmy we could not find, anymore than if he had indeed melted  into air. Mrs. Patterson came, and we had not found him. Things were  getting serious. Uncle Roger and Peter were summoned from the field.  Mrs. Patterson became hysterical, and was taken into the spare room with  such remedies as could be suggested. Everybody blamed poor Dan. Cecily  asked him what he would feel like if Jimmy was never, never found. The  Story Girl had a gruesome recollection of some baby at Markdale who had  wandered away like that--    \"And they never found him till the next spring, and all they found  was--HIS SKELETON, with the grass growing through it,\" she whispered.    \"This beats me,\" said Uncle Roger, when a fruitless hour had elapsed. \"I  do hope that baby hasn't wandered down to the swamp. It seems impossible  he could walk so far; but I must go and see. Felicity, hand me my high  boots out from under the sofa, there's a girl.\"    Felicity, pale and tearful, dropped on her knees and lifted the cretonne  frill of the sofa. There, his head pillowed hardly on Uncle Roger's  boots, lay Jimmy Patterson, still sound asleep!    \"Well, I'll be--jiggered!\" said Uncle Roger.    \"I KNEW he never went out of the door,\" cried Dan triumphantly.    When the last buggy had driven away, Felicity set a batch of bread, and  the rest of us sat around the back porch steps in the cat's light and  ate cherries, shooting the stones at each other. Cecily was in quest of  information.    \"What does 'it never rains but it pours' mean?\"    \"Oh, it means if anything happens something else is sure to happen,\"  said the Story Girl. \"I'll illustrate. There's Mrs. Murphy. She never  had a proposal in her life till she was forty, and then she had three  in the one week, and she was so flustered she took the wrong one and has  been sorry ever since. Do you see what it means now?\"    \"Yes, I guess so,\" said Cecily somewhat doubtfully. Later on we heard  her imparting her newly acquired knowledge to Felicity in the pantry.    \"'It never rains but it pours' means that nobody wants to marry you for  ever so long, and then lots of people do.\"        CHAPTER XIV. FORBIDDEN FRUIT    We were all, with the exception of Uncle Roger, more or less grumpy in  the household of King next day. Perhaps our nerves had been upset by the  excitement attendant on Jimmy Patterson's disappearance. But it is more  likely that our crankiness was the result of the supper we had eaten the  previous night. Even children cannot devour mince pie, and cold fried  pork ham, and fruit cake before going to bed with entire impunity. Aunt  Janet had forgotten to warn Uncle Roger to keep an eye on our bedtime  snacks, and we ate what seemed good unto us.    Some of us had frightful dreams, and all of us carried chips on our  shoulders at breakfast. Felicity and Dan began a bickering which they  kept up the entire day. Felicity had a natural aptitude for what we  called \"bossing,\" and in her mother's absence she deemed that she had  a right to rule supreme. She knew better than to make any attempt to  assert authority over the Story Girl, and Felix and I were allowed some  length of tether; but Cecily, Dan, and Peter were expected to submit  dutifully to her decrees. In the main they did; but on this particular  morning Dan was plainly inclined to rebel. He had had time to grow sore  over the things that Felicity had said to him when Jimmy Patterson was  thought lost, and he began the day with a flatly expressed determination  that he was not going to let Felicity rule the roost.    It was not a pleasant day, and to make matters worse it rained until  late in the afternoon. The Story Girl had not recovered from the  mortifications of the previous day; she would not talk, and she would  not tell a single story; she sat on Rachel Ward's chest and ate her  breakfast with the air of a martyr. After breakfast she washed the  dishes and did the bed-room work in grim silence; then, with a book  under one arm and Pat under the other, she betook herself to the  window-seat in the upstairs hall, and would"]]]
