He died before Henry; and the latter showed, in his attachment to this  nobleman, that notwithstanding his fits of capriciousness and cruelty,  he was capable of a cordial and steady friendship. He was sitting in  council when the news of Suffolk's death reached him; and he publicly  took that occasion, both to express his own sorrow, and to celebrate the  merits of the deceased. He declared, that during the whole course of  their acquaintance, his brother-in-law had not made a single attempt to  injure an adversary, and had never whispered a word to the disadvantage  of any one; \"and are there _any of you_, my lords, who can say as much?\"  When the king subjoined these words, (says the historian,) he looked  round in all their faces, and saw that confusion which the consciousness  of secret guilt naturally threw upon them.    Otway took his plot from the fact related in this pamphlet; but to  avoid, perhaps, interfering in a circumstance which might affect many  noble families at that time living, he laid the scene of his tragedy in  Bohemia.    There is a large painting of the above incident now at Woburn, the seat  of his Grace the Duke of Bedford; and the old duchess-dowager, in  showing this picture a few years before her death to a nobleman, related  the particulars of the story.    A CORRESPONDENT.             *       *       *       *       *    THE TOPOGRAPHER.           *       *       *       *       *      CARMARTHEN.    _(For the Mirror)_      The best or north-east view of Carmarthen comprises the bridge, part of  the quay, with the granaries and shipping, and in the middle is seen  part of the castle. Few towns can, perhaps, boast of greater antiquity,  or of so many antiquarian remains as Carmarthen, South Wales; although,  I am sorry to say, that their origin and history have not been, I  believe, clearly explained or understood by the literary world. One  would conclude, that as a Welshman is almost proverbially distinguished  for deeming himself illustriously descended, and relating his long  pedigree, he would naturally boast of, and exhibit to the public, some  account of these vestiges of his ancestors; but such is not the case,  and to their shame be it spoken, these ruins are scarcely noticed with  any degree of interest by the inhabitants of Carmarthen. But to my  subject. The name is derived from _caera_, wall, and _marthen_, a  corruption of Merlyn, the name of its founder, who was a great  necromancer and prophet, and held in high respect by the Welsh. There is  a seat hewn out of a rock in a grove near this town, called Merlyn's  Grove, where it is said he studied. He prophesied the fate of Wales, and  said that Carmarthen would some day sink and be covered with water. I  would concur with the author of a \"Family Tour through the British  Empire,\" by attributing his influence, not to any powers in magic, but  to a superior understanding; although some of his predictions have been  verified. The town of Carmarthen is pleasantly situated in a valley  surrounded by hills; it has been fortified with walls and a castle, part  of which remain; so that it appears to have been the residence of many  princes of Wales. It has also been a Roman station, and has the remains  of a Roman praetorium. Amongst its other antiquities are the Grey Friars,  (a monastery,) the Bulwark, (a trench on the side of the town that  fronts the river,) and the Priory. Its modern buildings are, the  monument erected to Sir Thomas Picton, the Guildhall, the two gaols, a  fish and butter market-place, over which is the town fire-bell; the  slaughter-house, similar to the abattoir at Paris, and excellent  shambles, with poultry and potato market-places annexed. The church,  which is an ancient one, has an unattractive exterior; but when you  enter it, I think you will say it can compete with any church for  ancient beauty and ornament. Amongst the tombs in the chancel are those  of Sir Rhys ap Thomas, with the effigies of him and his lady, affording  a specimen of the costume of the reign of Henry VII.; and Sir Richard  Steele, whose remains are discovered by a small, simple tablet. There is  a promenade here, called the Parade, which commands a fine and extensive  view of the surrounding picturesque scenery and of the Towy, where the  coracles may be seen plying about. The town consists of ten principal  streets, noted for being kept clean, and lighted with gas. It is  governed by a mayor, two sheriffs, and twenty councilmen; sends a member  to Parliament, and gives title of marquess to the family of Osborne. It  carries on a great trade in butter and oats; and traffics much with  Bristol by the river Towy, which runs into the sea; whence ships of two  hundred tons burden come up to the town. The bay is very dangerous,  owing to the bar and the quicksands. Its chief manufacture is tin, which  is esteemed the best in the kingdom. It has a small theatre, in  appearance a stable; but it is in contemplation to build a new one, as  also a church; so that you will perceive the march of improvement is  rapidly spreading into Wales, as well as other places.    W.H.    P.S. Since I sent you an account of Picton's Monument at Carmarthen, it  has been altered. The statue, bas-reliefs, and ornaments of the Picton  Monument, have been bronzed by the direction of Mr. Nash, on his late  visit to this town. Elegant as this column was before, the effect of the  bronze, and a few other alterations, have so improved its appearance, as  to make it seem a different structure. Nothing now remains to complete  the outside but the names of the different actions in which Sir T.  Picton was engaged during his honourable career. These are to be placed  in bronzed letters on the base. A Latin inscription, already prepared,  together with the arms and a bust of Picton, will ornament the inside of  the building. It certainly is a monument worthy of the hero to whose  memory it has been erected, and of the country by which it has been  raised.             *       *       *       *       *    THE SKETCH BOOK.           *       *       *       *       *      WATERLOO, THE DAY AFTER THE BATTLE.    _By an eye witness._    [For the following very interesting Narrative, our acknowledgments are  due to the _United Service Journal,_--a work which has just started with  the year, and to which, in the \"customary\" phrase, we wish \"many happy  returns.\"]    The summer of 1815 found me at Brussels. The town was then crowded to  excess--it seemed a city of splendour; the bright and varied uniforms of  so many different nations, mingled with the gay dresses of female beauty  in the Park, and the _Allee Verte_ was thronged with superb horses and  brilliant equipages. The _tables d'hote_ resounded with a confusion of  tongues which might have rivalled the Tower of Babel, and the shops  actually glittered with showy toys hung out to tempt money from the  pockets of the English, whom the Flemings seemed to consider as walking  bags of gold. Balls and plays, routs and dinners were the only topics of  conversation; and though some occasional rumours were spread that the  French had made an incursion within the lines, and carried off a few  head of cattle, the tales were too vague to excite the least alarm. I  was then lodging with a Madame Tissand, on the Place du Sablon, and I  occasionally chatted with my hostess on the critical posture of affairs.  Every Frenchwoman loves politics, and Madame Tissand, who was deeply  interested in the subject, continually assured me of her complete  devotion to the English.--\"Ces maudits Francois!\" cried she one day,  with almost terrific energy, when speaking of Napoleon's army. \"If they  should dare come to Brussels, I will tear their eyes out!\"--\"Oh, aunt!\"  sighed her pretty niece; \"remember that Louis is a conscript!\"--\"Silence,  Annette. I hate even my son, since he is fighting against the brave  English!\"--This was accompanied with a bow to me; but I own that I  thought Annette's love far more interesting than Madame's Anglicism.    On the 3rd of June, I went to see ten thousand troops reviewed by the  Dukes of Wellington and Brunswick. Imagination cannot picture any thing  finer than the _ensemble_ of this scene. The splendid uniforms of the  English, Scotch, and Hanoverians, contrasted strongly with the gloomy  black of the Brunswick Hussars, whose veneration for the memory of their  old Duke, could be only be equalled by their devotion to his son. The  firm step of the Highlanders seemed irresistible; and as they moved in  solid masses, they appeared prepared to sweep away every thing that  opposed them. In short, I was delighted with the cleanliness, military  order, and excellent appointments of the men generally, and I was  particularly struck with the handsome features of the Duke of Brunswick,  whose fine, manly figure, as he galloped across the field, quite  realized my _beau ideal_ of a warrior. The next time I saw the Duke of  Brunswick was at the dress ball, given at the Assembly-rooms in the Rue  Ducale, on the night of the 15th of June. I stood near him when he  received the information that a powerful French force was advancing in  the direction of Charleroy. \"Then it is high time for me to be off,\"  said the Duke, and I never saw him alive again. The assembly broke up  abruptly, and in half an hour drums were beating and bugles sounding.  The good burghers of the city, who were almost all enjoying their first  sleep, started from their beds at the alarm, and hastened to the  streets, wrapped in the first things they could find. The most  ridiculous and absurd rumours were rapidly circulated and believed. The  most general impression seemed to be that the town was on fire; the next  that the Duke of Wellington had been assassinated; but when it was  discovered that the French were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#2)"],[1,"by law to the performance of  military duty. It is still further to be observed, that the right of  suffrage continues as long as the mind lasts, while ordinary liability  to military service ceases at a period when the physical powers,  though still strong, are beginning to wane. The truth is, that there  is no legal or natural connection between the right or liability to  fight and the right to vote.    The right to fight may be exercised voluntarily or the liability to  fight may be enforced by the community whenever there is an invasion  of right, and the extent to which the physical forces of society  may be called upon in self-defense or in justifiable revolution is  measured not by age or sex, but by necessity, and may go so far as to  call into the field old men and women and the last vestige of physical  force. It can not be claimed that woman has no right to vote because  she is not liable to fight, for she is so liable, and the freest  government on the face of the earth has the reserved power under the  call of necessity to place her in the forefront of battle itself, and  more than this, woman has the right, and often has exercised it, to go  there.    If any one could question the existence of this reserved power of  society to call the force of woman to the common defense, either in  the hospital or the field, it would be woman, who has been deprived of  participation in the government and in shaping the public policy which  has resulted in dire emergency to the state. But in all times, and  under all forms of government and of social existence, woman has given  her body and her soul to the common defense.    The qualification of age, then, is imposed for the purpose of securing  mental and moral fitness for the suffrage on the part of those who  exercise it. It has no relation to the possession of physical powers  at all.    All other qualifications imposed upon male citizens, save only that of  their sex, as prerequisites to the exercise of suffrage have the same  objects in view, and can have no other.    The property qualification is, to my mind, an invasion of natural  right, which elevates mere property to an equality with life and  personal liberty, and ought never to be imposed upon the suffrage.  But, however that may be, its application or removal has no relation  to sex, and its only object is to secure the exercise of the  suffrage under a stronger sense of obligation and responsibility--a  qualification, be it observed, of no consequence save as it influences  the mind of the voter in the exercise of his right.    The same is true of the qualifications of sanity, education, and  obedience to the laws, which exclude dementia, ignorance, and  crime from participation in the sovereignty. Every condition or  qualification imposed upon the exercise of the suffrage by the citizen  save only sex has for its only object or possible justification  the possession of mental and moral fitness, and has no relation to  physical power.    The question then arises why is the qualification of masculinity  required at all?    The distinction between human beings by reason of sex is a physical  distinction. The soul is of no sex. If there be a distinction of soul  by reason of the physical difference, or accompanying that physical  difference, woman is the superior of man in mental and moral  qualities. In proof of this see the report of the minority and all the  eulogiums of woman pronounced by those who, like the serpent of old,  would flatter her vanity that they may continue to wield her power.    I repeat it, that the soul is of no sex, and that sex is, so far as  the possession and exercise of human rights and powers are concerned,  but a physical property, in which the female is just as important as  the male, and the possessor thereof under just as great need of power  in the organization and management of society and the government of  society as man; and if there be a difference, she, by reason of her  average physical inferiority, is really protected, and ought to be  protected, by a superior mental and moral fitness to give direction to  the course of society and the policy of the state. If, then, there be  a distinction between the souls of human beings resulting from sex, I  claim that, by the report of the minority and the universal testimony  of all men, woman is better fitted for the exercise of the suffrage  than man.    It is claimed by some that the suffrage is an inherent natural right,  and by others that it is merely a privilege extended to the individual  by society in its discretion. However this may be, practically any  extension of the exercise of the suffrage to individuals or classes  not now enjoying it must be by concession of those who already possess  it, and such extension without revolution will be through the suffrage  itself exercised by those who have it under existing forms.    The appeal by those who have it not must be made to those who are  asked to part with a portion of their own power, and it is not strange  that human nature, which is an essential element in the male sex,  should hesitate and delay to yield one-half its power to those whose  cause, however strong in reason and justice, lacks that physical  force which so largely has been the means by which the masses of men  themselves hare wrung their own rights from rulers and kings.    It is not strange that when overwhelmed with argument and half won by  appeals to his better nature to concede to woman her equal power in  the state, and ashamed to blankly refuse that which he finds no  reason for longer withholding, man avoids the dilemma by a pretended  elevation of his helpmeet to a higher sphere, where, as an angel,  she has certain gauzy ethereal resources and superior functions,  occupations, and attributes which render the possession of mere  earthly every-day powers and privileges non-essential to woman,  however mere mortal men themselves may find them indispensable to  their own freedom and happiness.    But to the denial of her right to vote, whether that denial be the  blunt refusal of the ignorant or the polished evasion of the refined  courtier and politician, woman can oppose only her most solemn and  perpetual appeal to the reason of man and to the justice of Almighty  God. She must continually point out the nature and object of the  suffrage and the necessity that she possess it for her own and the  public good.    What, then, is the suffrage, and why is it necessary that woman should  possess and exercise this function of freemen? I quote briefly from  the report of the committee:        The rights for the maintenance of which human governments are      constituted are life, liberty, and property. These rights are      common to men and women alike, and whatever citizen or subject      exists as a member of any body-politic, under any form of      government, is entitled to demand from the sovereign power the      full protection of these rights.        This right to the protection of rights appertains to the      individual, not to the family alone, or to any form of      association, whether social or corporate. Probably not more than      five-eighths of the men of legal age, qualified to vote, are heads      of families, and not more than that proportion of adult women      are united with men in the legal merger of married life. It is,      therefore, quite incorrect to speak of the state as an aggregate      of families duly represented at the ballot-box by their male head.      The relation between the government and the individual is direct;      all rights are individual rights, all duties are individual      duties.        Government in its two highest functions is legislative and      judicial. By these powers the sovereignty prescribes the law,      and directs its application to the vindication of rights and the      redress of wrongs. Conscience and intelligence are the only forces      which enter into the exercise of this highest and primary function      of government. The remaining department is the executive or      administrative, and in all forms of government--the republican      as well as in tyranny--the primary element of administration is      force, and even in this department conscience and intelligence are      indispensable to its direction.        If now we are to decide who of our sixty millions of human beings      are to constitute the citizenship of this Republic and by virtue      of their qualifications to be the law-making power, by what tests      shall the selection be determined?        The suffrage which is the sovereignty is this great primary      law-making power. It is not the executive power proper at all. It      is not founded upon force. Only that degree of physical strength      which is essential to a sound body--the home of the healthy mental      and moral constitution--the sound soul in the sound body      is required in the performance of the function of primary      legislation. Never in the history of this or any other genuine      republic has the law-making power, whether in general elections or      in the framing of laws in legislative assemblies, been vested in      individuals who have exercised it by reason of their physical      powers. On the contrary, the physically weak have never for that      reason been deprived of the suffrage nor of the privilege of      service in the public councils so long as they possessed the      necessary powers of locomotion and expression, of conscience and      intelligence, which are common to all. The aged and the physically      weak have, as a rule, by reason of superior wisdom and moral      sense, far more than made good any bodily inferiority by which      they have differed from the more robust members of the community      in the discussion and decisions of the ballot-box and in councils      of the state.        The executive power of itself is a mere physical"]]]
