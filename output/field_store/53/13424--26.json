[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#19)"],[1," up!\" But he would not waken.    \"Dear me, how unfortunate!\" sighed the lovely Rainbow's Daughter. \"I  wonder what is the best and surest way to waken a dragon. All our  friends may be captured and destroyed while this great beast lies  asleep.\"    She walked around Quox two or three times, trying to discover some  tender place on his body where a thump or a punch might be felt; but he  lay extended along the rocks with his chin flat upon the ground and his  legs drawn underneath his body, and all that one could see was his  thick sky-blue skin--thicker than that of a rhinoceros--and his silver  scales.    Then, despairing at last of wakening the beast, and worried over the  fate of her friends, Polychrome again ran down to the entrance and  hurried along the passage into the Nome King's cavern.    Here she found Ruggedo lolling in his throne and smoking a long pipe.  Beside him stood General Guph and Kaliko, and ranged before the King  were the Rose Princess, Files and the Shaggy Man. Tik-Tok still lay  upon the floor, weighted down by the big diamond.    Ruggedo was now in a more contented frame of mind. One by one he had  met the invaders and easily captured them. The dreaded Love Magnet was  indeed in Shaggy's pocket, only a few feet away from the King, but  Shaggy was powerless to show it and unless Ruggedo's eyes beheld the  talisman it could not affect him. As for Betsy Bobbin and her mule, he  believed Kaliko had placed them in the Slimy Cave, while Ann and her  officers he thought safely imprisoned in the pit. Ruggedo had no fear  of Files or Ozga, but to be on the safe side he had ordered golden  handcuffs placed upon their wrists. These did not cause them any great  annoyance but prevented them from making an attack, had they been  inclined to do so.    The Nome King, thinking himself wholly master of the situation, was  laughing and jeering at his prisoners when Polychrome, exquisitely  beautiful and dancing like a ray of light, entered the cavern.    \"Oho!\" cried the King; \"a Rainbow under ground, eh?\" and then he stared  hard at Polychrome, and still harder, and then he sat up and pulled the  wrinkles out of his robe and arranged his whiskers. \"On my word,\" said  he, \"you are a very captivating creature; moreover, I perceive you are  a fairy.\"    \"I am Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter,\" she said proudly.    \"Well,\" replied Ruggedo, \"I like you. The others I hate. I hate  everybody--but you! Wouldn't you like to live always in this beautiful  cavern, Polychrome? See! the jewels that stud the walls have every tint  and color of your Rainbow--and they are not so elusive. I'll have fresh  dewdrops gathered for your feasting every day and you shall be Queen of  all my nomes and pull Kaliko's nose whenever you like.\"    \"No, thank you,\" laughed Polychrome. \"My home is in the sky, and I'm  only on a visit to this solid, sordid earth. But tell me, Ruggedo, why  my friends have been wound with cords and bound with chains?\"    \"They threatened me,\" answered Ruggedo. \"The fools did not know how  powerful I am.\"    \"Then, since they are now helpless, why not release them and send them  back to the earth's surface?\"    \"Because I hate 'em and mean to make 'em suffer for their invasion. But  I'll make a bargain with you, sweet Polly. Remain here and live with me  and I'll set all these people free. You shall be my daughter or my wife  or my aunt or grandmother--whichever you like--only stay here to  brighten my gloomy kingdom and make me happy!\"    Polychrome looked at him wonderingly. Then she turned to Shaggy and  asked:    \"Are you sure he hasn't seen the Love Magnet?\"    \"I'm positive,\" answered Shaggy. \"But you seem to be something of a  Love Magnet yourself, Polychrome.\"    She laughed again and said to Ruggedo: \"Not even to rescue my friends  would I live in your kingdom. Nor could I endure for long the society  of such a wicked monster as you.\"    \"You forget,\" retorted the King, scowling darkly, \"that you also are in  my power.\"    \"Not so, Ruggedo. The Rainbow's Daughter is beyond the reach of your  spite or malice.\"    \"Seize her!\" suddenly shouted the King, and General Guph sprang forward  to obey. Polychrome stood quite still, yet when Guph attempted to  clutch her his hands met in air, and now the Rainbow's Daughter was in  another part of the room, as smiling and composed as before.    Several times Guph endeavored to capture her and Ruggedo even came down  from his throne to assist his General; but never could they lay hands  upon the lovely sky fairy, who flitted here and there with the  swiftness of light and constantly defied them with her merry laughter  as she evaded their efforts.    So after a time they abandoned the chase and Ruggedo returned to his  throne and wiped the perspiration from his face with a finely-woven  handkerchief of cloth-of-gold.    \"Well,\" said Polychrome, \"what do you intend to do now?\"    \"I'm going to have some fun, to repay me for all my bother,\" replied  the Nome King. Then he said to Kaliko: \"Summon the executioners.\"    Kaliko at once withdrew and presently returned with a score of nomes,  all of whom were nearly as evil looking as their hated master. They  bore great golden pincers, and prods of silver, and clamps and chains  and various wicked-looking instruments, all made of precious metals and  set with diamonds and rubies.    \"Now, Pang,\" said Ruggedo, addressing the leader of the executioners,  \"fetch the Army of Oogaboo and their Queen from the pit and torture  them here in my presence--as well as in the presence of their friends.  It will be great sport.\"    \"I hear Your Majesty, and I obey Your Majesty,\" answered Pang, and went  with his nomes into the passage. In a few minutes he returned and bowed  to Ruggedo.    \"They're all gone,\" said he.    \"Gone!\" exclaimed the Nome King. \"Gone where?\"    \"They left no address, Your Majesty; but they are not in the pit.\"    \"Picks and puddles!\" roared the King; \"who took the cover off?\"    \"No one,\" said Pang. \"The cover was there, but the prisoners were not  under it.\"    \"In that case,\" snarled the King, trying to control his disappointment,  \"go to the Slimy Cave and fetch hither the girl and the donkey. And  while we are torturing them Kaliko must take a hundred nomes and search  for the escaped prisoners--the Queen of Oogaboo and her officers. If he  does not find them, I will torture Kaliko.\"    Kaliko went away looking sad and disturbed, for he knew the King was  cruel and unjust enough to carry out this threat. Pang and the  executioners also went away, in another direction, but when they came  back Betsy Bobbin was not with them, nor was Hank.    \"There is no one in the Slimy Cave, Your Majesty,\" reported Pang.    \"Jumping jellycakes!\" screamed the King. \"Another escape? Are you sure  you found the right cave?\"    \"There is but one Slimy Cave, and there is no one in it,\" returned Pang  positively.    Ruggedo was beginning to be alarmed as well as angry. However, these  disappointments but made him the more vindictive and he cast an evil  look at the other prisoners and said:    \"Never mind the girl and the donkey. Here are four, at least, who  cannot escape my vengeance. Let me see; I believe I'll change my mind  about Tik-Tok. Have the gold crucible heated to a white, seething heat,  and then we'll dump the copper man into it and melt him up.\"    \"But, Your Majesty,\" protested Kaliko, who had returned to the room  after sending a hundred nomes to search for the Oogaboo people, \"you  must remember that Tik-Tok is a very curious and interesting machine.  It would be a shame to deprive the world of such a clever contrivance.\"    \"Say another word, and you'll go into the furnace with him!\" roared the  King. \"I'm getting tired of you, Kaliko, and the first thing you know  I'll turn you into a potato and make Saratoga-chips of you! The next to  consider,\" he added more mildly, \"is the Shaggy Man. As he owns the  Love Magnet, I think I'll transform him into a dove, and then we can  practice shooting at him with Tik-Tok's gun. Now, this is a very  interesting ceremony and I beg you all to watch me closely and see that  I've nothing up my sleeve.\"    He came out of his throne to stand before the Shaggy Man, and then he  waved his hands, palms downward, in seven semicircles over his victim's  head, saying in a low but clear tone of voice the magic wugwa:      \"Adi, edi, idi, odi, udi, oo-i-oo!    Idu, ido, idi, ide, ida, woo!\"    The effect of this well-known sorcery was instantaneous. Instead of the  Shaggy Man, a pretty dove lay fluttering upon the floor, its wings  confined by tiny cords wound around them. Ruggedo gave an order to  Pang, who cut the cords with a pair of scissors. Being freed, the dove  quickly flew upward and alighted on the shoulder of the Rose Princess,  who stroked it tenderly.    \"Very good! Very good!\" cried Ruggedo, rubbing his hands gleefully  together. \"One enemy is out of my way, and now for the others.\"    (Perhaps my readers should be warned not to attempt the above  transformation; for, although the exact magical formula has been  described, it is unlawful in all civilized countries for anyone to  transform a person into a dove by muttering the words Ruggedo used.  There were no laws to prevent the Nome King from performing this  transformation, but if it should be attempted in any other country, and  the magic worked, the magician would be severely punished.)    When Polychrome saw Shaggy Man transformed into a dove and realized  that Ruggedo was about to do something as dreadful to the Princess and  Files, and that Tik-Tok would soon be melted in a crucible, she turned  and ran from the cavern, through the passage and back to the place  where Quox lay asleep.          Chapter Eighteen    A Clever Conquest      The great dragon still had his eyes closed and was even snoring in a  manner that resembled distant thunder; but Polychrome was now  desperate, because any further"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#19)"],[1,"break the enchantment. I'm sure Glinda could do it, in a jiffy.\"    \"Who is Glinda?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.    Then the Scarecrow told them all about Glinda, not forgetting to  mention her beauty and goodness and her wonderful powers of magic. He  also explained how the Royal Sorceress had sent him to Jinxland  especially to help the strangers, whom she knew to be in danger because  of the wiles of the cruel King and the Wicked Witch.          Chapter Sixteen    Pon Summons the King to Surrender      Gloria had drawn near to the group to listen to their talk, and it  seemed to interest her in spite of her frigid manner. They knew, of  course, that the poor Princess could not help being cold and reserved,  so they tried not to blame her.    \"I ought to have come here a little sooner,\" said the Scarecrow,  regretfully; \"but Glinda sent me as soon as she discovered you were  here and were likely to get into trouble. And now that we are all  together--except Button-Bright, over whom it is useless to worry--I  propose we hold a council of war, to decide what is best to be done.\"    That seemed a wise thing to do, so they all sat down upon the grass,  including Gloria, and the grasshopper perched upon Trot's shoulder and  allowed her to stroke him gently with her hand.    \"In the first place,\" began the Scarecrow, \"this King Krewl is a  usurper and has no right to rule this Kingdom of Jinxland.\"    \"That is true,\" said Pon, eagerly. \"My father was King before him, and  I--\"    \"You are a gardener's boy,\" interrupted the Scarecrow. \"Your father had  no right to rule, either, for the rightful King of this land was the  father of Princess Gloria, and only she is entitled to sit upon the  throne of Jinxland.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Trot. \"But what'll we do with King Krewl? I s'pose he  won't give up the throne unless he has to.\"    \"No, of course not,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Therefore it will be our duty  to make him give up the throne.\"    \"How?\" asked Trot.    \"Give me time to think,\" was the reply. \"That's what my brains are for.  I don't know whether you people ever think, or not, but my brains are  the best that the Wizard of Oz ever turned out, and if I give them  plenty of time to work, the result usually surprises me.\"    \"Take your time, then,\" suggested Trot. \"There's no hurry.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the straw man, and sat perfectly still for half an  hour. During this interval the grasshopper whispered in Trot's ear, to  which he was very close, and Trot whispered back to the grasshopper  sitting upon her shoulder. Pon cast loving glances at Gloria, who paid  not the slightest heed to them.    Finally the Scarecrow laughed aloud.    \"Brains working?\" inquired Trot.    \"Yes. They seem in fine order to-day. We will conquer King Krewl and  put Gloria upon his throne as Queen of Jinxland.\"    \"Fine!\" cried the little girl, clapping her hands together gleefully.  \"But how?\"    \"Leave the how to me,\" said the Scarecrow proudly. \"As a conqueror I'm  a wonder. We will, first of all, write a message to send to King Krewl,  asking him to surrender. If he refuses, then we will make him  surrender.\"    \"Why ask him, when we know he'll refuse?\" inquired Pon.    \"Why, we must be polite, whatever we do,\" explained the Scarecrow. \"It  would be very rude to conquer a King without proper notice.\"    They found it difficult to write a message without paper, pen and ink,  none of which was at hand; so it was decided to send Pon as a  messenger, with instructions to ask the King, politely but firmly, to  surrender.    Pon was not anxious to be the messenger. Indeed, he hinted that it  might prove a dangerous mission. But the Scarecrow was now the  acknowledged head of the Army of Conquest, and he would listen to no  refusal. So off Pon started for the King's castle, and the others  accompanied him as far as his hut, where they had decided to await the  gardener's boy's return.    I think it was because Pon had known the Scarecrow such a short time  that he lacked confidence in the straw man's wisdom. It was easy to  say: \"We will conquer King Krewl,\" but when Pon drew near to the great  castle he began to doubt the ability of a straw-stuffed man, a girl, a  grasshopper and a frozen-hearted Princess to do it. As for himself, he  had never thought of defying the King before.    That was why the gardener's boy was not very bold when he entered the  castle and passed through to the enclosed court where the King was just  then seated, with his favorite courtiers around him. None prevented  Pon's entrance, because he was known to be the gardener's boy, but when  the King saw him he began to frown fiercely. He considered Pon to be to  blame for all his trouble with Princess Gloria, who since her heart had  been frozen had escaped to some unknown place, instead of returning to  the castle to wed Googly-Goo, as she had been expected to do. So the  King bared his teeth angrily as he demanded:    \"What have you done with Princess Gloria?\"    \"Nothing, your Majesty! I have done nothing at all,\" answered Pon in a  faltering voice. \"She does not love me any more and even refuses to  speak to me.\"    \"Then why are you here, you rascal?\" roared the King.    Pon looked first one way and then another, but saw no means of escape;  so he plucked up courage.    \"I am here to summon your Majesty to surrender.\"    \"What!\" shouted the King. \"Surrender?  Surrender to whom?\"    Pon's heart sank to his boots.    \"To the Scarecrow,\" he replied.    Some of the courtiers began to titter, but King Krewl was greatly  annoyed. He sprang up and began to beat poor Pon with the golden staff  he carried. Pon howled lustily and would have run away had not two of  the soldiers held him until his Majesty was exhausted with punishing  the boy. Then they let him go and he left the castle and returned along  the road, sobbing at every step because his body was so sore and aching.    \"Well,\" said the Scarecrow, \"did the King surrender?\"    \"No; but he gave me a good drubbing!\" sobbed poor Pon.    Trot was very sorry for Pon, but Gloria did not seem affected in any  way by her lover's anguish. The grasshopper leaped to the Scarecrow's  shoulder and asked him what he was going to do next.    \"Conquer,\" was the reply. \"But I will go alone, this time, for beatings  cannot hurt me at all; nor can lance thrusts--or sword cuts--or arrow  pricks.\"    \"Why is that?\" inquired Trot.    \"Because I have no nerves, such as you meat people possess. Even  grasshoppers have nerves, but straw doesn't; so whatever they  do--except just one thing--they cannot injure me. Therefore I expect to  conquer King Krewl with ease.\"    \"What is that one thing you excepted?\" asked Trot.    \"They will never think of it, so never mind. And now, if you will  kindly excuse me for a time, I'll go over to the castle and do my  conquering.\"    \"You have no weapons,\" Pon reminded him.    \"True,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But if I carried weapons I might injure  someone--perhaps seriously--and that would make me unhappy. I will just  borrow that riding-whip, which I see in the corner of your hut, if you  don't mind. It isn't exactly proper to walk with a riding-whip, but I  trust you will excuse the inconsistency.\"    Pon handed him the whip and the Scarecrow bowed to all the party and  left the hut, proceeding leisurely along the way to the King's castle.          Chapter Seventeen    The Ork Rescues Button-Bright      I must now tell you what had become of Button-Bright since he wandered  away in the morning and got lost. This small boy, as perhaps you have  discovered, was almost as destitute of nerves as the Scarecrow. Nothing  ever astonished him much; nothing ever worried him or made him unhappy.  Good fortune or bad fortune he accepted with a quiet smile, never  complaining, whatever happened. This was one reason why Button-Bright  was a favorite with all who knew him--and perhaps it was the reason why  he so often got into difficulties, or found himself lost.    To-day, as he wandered here and there, over hill and down dale, he  missed Trot and Cap'n Bill, of whom he was fond, but nevertheless he  was not unhappy. The birds sang merrily and the wildflowers were  beautiful and the breeze had a fragrance of new-mown hay.    \"The only bad thing about this country is its King,\" he reflected; \"but  the country isn't to blame for that.\"    A prairie-dog stuck its round head out of a mound of earth and looked  at the boy with bright eyes.    \"Walk around my house, please,\" it said, \"and then you won't harm it or  disturb the babies.\"    \"All right,\" answered Button-Bright, and took care not to step on the  mound. He went on, whistling merrily, until a petulant voice cried:    \"Oh, stop it! Please stop that noise. It gets on my nerves.\"    Button-Bright saw an old gray owl sitting in the crotch of a tree, and  he replied with a laugh: \"All right, old Fussy,\" and stopped whistling  until he had passed out of the owl's hearing. At noon he came to a  farmhouse where an aged couple lived. They gave him a good dinner and  treated him kindly, but the man was deaf and the woman was dumb, so  they could answer no questions to guide him on the way to Pon's house.  When he left them he was just as much lost as he had been before.    Every grove of trees he saw from a distance he visited, for he  remembered that the King's castle was near a grove of trees and Pon's  hut was near the King's castle; but always he met with disappointment.  Finally, passing through one of these groves, he came out into the open  and found himself face to face with the Ork.    \"Hello!\" said Button-Bright. \"Where did you come from?\"    \"From Orkland,\" was the reply. \"I've found my own country, at last, and  it is not far from here, either. I would have come back to you sooner,  to see how you are getting along, had not my family and friends  welcomed my return so royally that a great celebration was held in my  honor. So I couldn't very well leave"]]]
