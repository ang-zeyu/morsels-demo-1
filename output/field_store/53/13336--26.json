Comrade Prebble's address streamed on  like water rushing over a weir. Every now and then there was a word or  two which was recognizable, but this happened so rarely that it  amounted to little. Sometimes Mr Waller would interject a remark, but  not often. He seemed to be of the opinion that Comrade Prebble's was  the master mind and that to add anything to his views would be in the  nature of painting the lily and gilding the refined gold. Mike himself  said nothing. Psmith and Edward were equally silent. The former sat  like one in a trance, thinking his own thoughts, while Edward, who,  prospecting on the sideboard, had located a rich biscuit-mine, was too  occupied for speech.    After about twenty minutes, during which Mike's discomfort changed to a  dull resignation, Mr Waller suggested a move to the drawing-room, where  Ada, he said, would play some hymns.    The prospect did not dazzle Mike, but any change, he thought, must be  for the better. He had sat staring at the ruin of the blancmange so  long that it had begun to hypnotize him. Also, the move had the  excellent result of eliminating the snub-nosed Edward, who was sent to  bed. His last words were in the form of a question, addressed to Mike,  on the subject of the hypotenuse and the square upon the same.    'A remarkably intelligent boy,' said Psmith. 'You must let him come to  tea at our flat one day. I may not be in myself--I have many duties  which keep me away--but Comrade Jackson is sure to be there, and will  be delighted to chat with him.'    On the way upstairs Mike tried to get Psmith to himself for a moment to  suggest the advisability of an early departure; but Psmith was in close  conversation with his host. Mike was left to Comrade Prebble, who,  apparently, had only touched the fringe of his subject in his lecture  in the dining-room.    When Mr Waller had predicted hymns in the drawing-room, he had been too  sanguine (or too pessimistic). Of Ada, when they arrived, there were no  signs. It seemed that she had gone straight to bed. Young Mr Richards  was sitting on the sofa, moodily turning the leaves of a photograph  album, which contained portraits of Master Edward Waller in  geometrically progressing degrees of repulsiveness--here, in frocks,  looking like a gargoyle; there, in sailor suit, looking like nothing on  earth. The inspection of these was obviously deepening Mr Richards'  gloom, but he proceeded doggedly with it.    Comrade Prebble backed the reluctant Mike into a corner, and, like the  Ancient Mariner, held him with a glittering eye. Psmith and Mr Waller,  in the opposite corner, were looking at something with their heads  close together. Mike definitely abandoned all hope of a rescue from  Psmith, and tried to buoy himself up with the reflection that this  could not last for ever.    Hours seemed to pass, and then at last he heard Psmith's voice saying  good-bye to his host.    He sprang to his feet. Comrade Prebble was in the middle of a sentence,  but this was no time for polished courtesy. He felt that he must get  away, and at once. 'I fear,' Psmith was saying, 'that we must tear  ourselves away. We have greatly enjoyed our evening. You must look us  up at our flat one day, and bring Comrade Prebble. If I am not in,  Comrade Jackson is certain to be, and he will be more than delighted to  hear Comrade Prebble speak further on the subject of which he is such a  master.' Comrade Prebble was understood to say that he would certainly  come. Mr Waller beamed. Mr Richards, still steeped in gloom, shook  hands in silence.    Out in the road, with the front door shut behind them, Mike spoke his  mind.    'Look here, Smith,' he said definitely, 'if being your confidential  secretary and adviser is going to let me in for any more of that sort  of thing, you can jolly well accept my resignation.'    'The orgy was not to your taste?' said Psmith sympathetically.    Mike laughed. One of those short, hollow, bitter laughs.    'I am at a loss, Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith, 'to understand your  attitude. You fed sumptuously. You had fun with the crockery--that  knockabout act of yours with the water-jug was alone worth the  money--and you had the advantage of listening to the views of a  master of his subject. What more do you want?'    'What on earth did you land me with that man Prebble for?'    'Land you! Why, you courted his society. I had practically to drag you  away from him. When I got up to say good-bye, you were listening to him  with bulging eyes. I never saw such a picture of rapt attention. Do you  mean to tell me, Comrade Jackson, that your appearance belied you, that  you were not interested? Well, well. How we misread our fellow  creatures.'    'I think you might have come and lent a hand with Prebble. It was a bit  thick.'    'I was too absorbed with Comrade Waller. We were talking of things of  vital moment. However, the night is yet young. We will take this cab,  wend our way to the West, seek a cafe, and cheer ourselves with light  refreshments.'    Arrived at a cafe whose window appeared to be a sort of museum of every  kind of German sausage, they took possession of a vacant table and  ordered coffee. Mike soon found himself soothed by his bright  surroundings, and gradually his impressions of blancmange, Edward, and  Comrade Prebble faded from his mind. Psmith, meanwhile, was preserving  an unusual silence, being deep in a large square book of the sort in  which Press cuttings are pasted. As Psmith scanned its contents a  curious smile lit up his face. His reflections seemed to be of an  agreeable nature.    'Hullo,' said Mike, 'what have you got hold of there? Where did you get  that?'    'Comrade Waller very kindly lent it to me. He showed it to me after  supper, knowing how enthusiastically I was attached to the Cause. Had  you been less tensely wrapped up in Comrade Prebble's conversation, I  would have desired you to step across and join us. However, you now  have your opportunity.'    'But what is it?' asked Mike.    'It is the record of the meetings of the Tulse Hill Parliament,' said  Psmith impressively. 'A faithful record of all they said, all the votes  of confidence they passed in the Government, and also all the nasty  knocks they gave it from time to time.'    'What on earth's the Tulse Hill Parliament?'    'It is, alas,' said Psmith in a grave, sad voice, 'no more. In life it  was beautiful, but now it has done the Tom Bowling act. It has gone  aloft. We are dealing, Comrade Jackson, not with the live, vivid  present, but with the far-off, rusty past. And yet, in a way, there is  a touch of the live, vivid present mixed up in it.'    'I don't know what the dickens you're talking about,' said Mike. 'Let's  have a look, anyway.'    Psmith handed him the volume, and, leaning back, sipped his coffee, and  watched him. At first Mike's face was bored and blank, but suddenly an  interested look came into it.    'Aha!' said Psmith.    'Who's Bickersdyke? Anything to do with our Bickersdyke?'    'No other than our genial friend himself.'    Mike turned the pages, reading a line or two on each.    'Hullo!' he said, chuckling. 'He lets himself go a bit, doesn't he!'    'He does,' acknowledged Psmith. 'A fiery, passionate nature, that of  Comrade Bickersdyke.'    'He's simply cursing the Government here. Giving them frightful beans.'    Psmith nodded.    'I noticed the fact myself.'    'But what's it all about?'    'As far as I can glean from Comrade Waller,' said Psmith, 'about twenty  years ago, when he and Comrade Bickersdyke worked hand-in-hand as  fellow clerks at the New Asiatic, they were both members of the Tulse  Hill Parliament, that powerful institution. At that time Comrade  Bickersdyke was as fruity a Socialist as Comrade Waller is now. Only,  apparently, as he began to get on a bit in the world, he altered his  views to some extent as regards the iniquity of freezing on to a decent  share of the doubloons. And that, you see, is where the dim and rusty  past begins to get mixed up with the live, vivid present. If any  tactless person were to publish those very able speeches made by  Comrade Bickersdyke when a bulwark of the Tulse Hill Parliament, our  revered chief would be more or less caught bending, if I may employ the  expression, as regards his chances of getting in as Unionist candidate  at Kenningford. You follow me, Watson? I rather fancy the light-hearted  electors of Kenningford, from what I have seen of their rather acute  sense of humour, would be, as it were, all over it. It would be very,  very trying for Comrade Bickersdyke if these speeches of his were to  get about.'    'You aren't going to--!'    'I shall do nothing rashly. I shall merely place this handsome volume  among my treasured books. I shall add it to my \"Books that have helped  me\" series. Because I fancy that, in an emergency, it may not be at all  a bad thing to have about me. And now,' he concluded, 'as the hour is  getting late, perhaps we had better be shoving off for home.'          19. The Illness of Edward      Life in a bank is at its pleasantest in the winter. When all the world  outside is dark and damp and cold, the light and warmth of the place  are comforting. There is a pleasant air of solidity about the interior  of a bank. The green shaded lamps look cosy. And, the outside world  offering so few attractions, the worker, perched on his stool, feels  that he is not so badly off after all. It is when the days are long and  the sun beats hot on the pavement, and everything shouts to him how  splendid it is out in the country, that he begins to grow restless.    Mike, except for a fortnight at the beginning of his career in the New  Asiatic Bank, had not had to stand the test of sunshine. At present,  the weather being cold and dismal, he was almost entirely contented.  Now that he had got into the swing of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#19)"],[1,"of those who are  intended to command should, from the beginning, be different from other  citizens, as the children of kings are generally instructed in riding  and warlike exercises; and thus Euripides says:      \"... No showy arts Be mine, but teach me what the state requires.\"    As if those who are to rule were to have an education peculiar to  themselves. But if we allow, that the virtues of a good man and a  good magistrate may be the same, and a citizen is one who obeys the  magistrate, it follows that the virtue of the one cannot in general be  the same as the virtue of the other, although it may be true of some  particular citizen; for the virtue of the magistrate must be different  from the virtue of the citizen. For which reason Jason declared that  was he deprived of his kingdom he should pine away with regret, as not  knowing how to live a private man. But it is a great recommendation to  know how to command as well as to obey; and to do both these things well  is the virtue of an accomplished citizen. If then the virtue of a good  man consists only in being able to command, but the virtue of a good  citizen renders him equally fit for the one as well as the other, the  commendation of both of them is not the same. It appears, then, that  both he who commands and he who obeys should each of them learn their  separate business: but that the citizen should be master of and  take part in both these, as any one may easily perceive; in a family  government there is no occasion for the master to know how to perform  the necessary offices, but rather to enjoy the labour of others; for to  do the other is a servile part. I mean by the other, the common family  business of the slave.    There are many sorts of slaves; for their employments are various: of  these the handicraftsmen are one, who, as their name imports, get their  living by the labour of their hands, and amongst these all mechanics are  included; [1277b] for which reasons such workmen, in some states, were  not formerly admitted into any share in the government; till at length  democracies were established: it is not therefore proper for any man  of honour, or any citizen, or any one who engages in public affairs, to  learn these servile employments without they have occasion for them for  their own use; for without this was observed the distinction between a  master and a slave would be lost. But there is a government of another  sort, in which men govern those who are their equals in rank, and  freemen, which we call a political government, in which men learn to  command by first submitting to obey, as a good general of horse, or a  commander-in-chief, must acquire a knowledge of their duty by  having been long under the command of another, and the like in every  appointment in the army: for well is it said, no one knows how to  command who has not himself been under command of another. The virtues  of those are indeed different, but a good citizen must necessarily be  endowed with them; he ought also to know in what manner freemen ought  to govern, as well as be governed: and this, too, is the duty of a good  man. And if the temperance and justice of him who commands is different  from his who, though a freeman, is under command, it is evident that the  virtues of a good citizen cannot be the same as justice, for instance  but must be of a different species in these two different situations, as  the temperance and courage of a man and a woman are different from each  other; for a man would appear a coward who had only that courage which  would be graceful in a woman, and a woman would be thought a talker who  should take as large a part in the conversation as would become a man of  consequence.    The domestic employments of each of them are also different; it is the  man's business to acquire subsistence, the woman's to take care of it.  But direction and knowledge of public affairs is a virtue peculiar to  those who govern, while all others seem to be equally requisite for both  parties; but with this the governed have no concern, it is theirs to  entertain just notions: they indeed are like flute-makers, while those  who govern are the musicians who play on them. And thus much to show  whether the virtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same,  or if it is different, and also how far it is the same, and how far  different.          CHAPTER V      But with respect to citizens there is a doubt remaining, whether those  only are truly so who are allowed to share in the government, or whether  the mechanics also are to be considered as such? for if those who are  not permitted to rule are to be reckoned among them, it is impossible  that the virtue of all the citizens should be the same, for these also  are citizens; and if none of them are admitted to be citizens, where  shall they be ranked? for they are neither [1278a] sojourners nor  foreigners? or shall we say that there will no inconvenience arise from  their not being citizens, as they are neither slaves nor freedmen:  for this is certainly true, that all those are not citizens who are  necessary to the existence of a city, as boys are not citizens in the  same manner that men are, for those are perfectly so, the others under  some conditions; for they are citizens, though imperfect ones: for  in former times among some people the mechanics were either slaves or  foreigners, for which reason many of them are so now: and indeed the  best regulated states will not permit a mechanic to be a citizen; but  if it be allowed them, we cannot then attribute the virtue we have  described to every citizen or freeman, but to those only who are  disengaged from servile offices. Now those who are employed by one  person in them are slaves; those who do them for money are mechanics  and hired servants: hence it is evident on the least reflection what is  their situation, for what I have said is fully explained by appearances.  Since the number of communities is very great, it follows necessarily  that there will be many different sorts of citizens, particularly  of those who are governed by others, so that in one state it may be  necessary to admit mechanics and hired servants to be citizens, but in  others it may be impossible; as particularly in an aristocracy, where  honours are bestowed on virtue and dignity: for it is impossible for  one who lives the life of a mechanic or hired servant to acquire the  practice of virtue. In an oligarchy also hired servants are not admitted  to be citizens; because there a man's right to bear any office is  regulated by his fortune; but mechanics are, for many citizens are very  rich.    There was a law at Thebes that no one could have a share in the  government till he had been ten years out of trade. In many states the  law invites strangers to accept the freedom of the city; and in some  democracies the son of a free-woman is himself free. The same is also  observed in many others with respect to natural children; but it is  through want of citizens regularly born that they admit such: for these  laws are always made in consequence of a scarcity of inhabitants; so,  as their numbers increase, they first deprive the children of a male or  female slave of this privilege, next the child of a free-woman, and last  of all they will admit none but those whose fathers and mothers were  both free.    That there are many sorts of citizens, and that he may be said to be as  completely who shares the honours of the state, is evident from what  has been already said. Thus Achilles, in Homer, complains of Agamemnon's  treating him like an unhonoured stranger; for a stranger or sojourner is  one who does not partake of the honours of the state: and whenever the  right to the freedom of the city is kept obscure, it is for the sake of  the inhabitants. [1278b] From what has been said it is plain whether the  virtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same or different:  and we find that in some states it is the same, in others not; and also  that this is not true of each citizen, but of those only who take the  lead, or are capable of taking the lead, in public affairs, either alone  or in conjunction with others.          CHAPTER VI      Having established these points, we proceed next to consider whether one  form of government only should be established, or more than one; and if  more, how many, and of what sort, and what are the differences between  them. The form of government is the ordering and regulating of the city,  and all the offices in it, particularly those wherein the supreme power  is lodged; and this power is always possessed by the administration; but  the administration itself is that particular form of government which  is established in any state: thus in a democracy the supreme power is  lodged in the whole people; on the contrary, in an oligarchy it is in  the hands of a few. We say then, that the form of government in these  states is different, and we shall find the same thing hold good in  others. Let us first determine for whose sake a city is established;  and point out the different species of rule which man may submit to in  social life.    I have already mentioned in my treatise on the management of a family,  and the power of the master, that man is an animal naturally formed  for society, and that therefore, when he does not want any foreign  assistance, he will of his own accord desire to live with others; not  but that mutual advantage induces them to it, as far as it enables each  person to live more agreeably; and this is indeed the great object  not only to all in general, but also to each individual: but it is not  merely matter of choice, but they join in society also, even that they  may be able to live, which probably is not without some share of merit,  and they also support civil society, even for the sake of preserving  life, without they are grievously overwhelmed with the miseries of it:  for it"]]]
