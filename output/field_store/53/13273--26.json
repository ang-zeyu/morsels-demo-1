[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#19)"],[1,"   On the 22nd day of July, A.D. 1843, Hyrum Smith, the martyred  Patriarch, came in a carriage to my house in Nauvoo; he invited me  and my wife to take a ride with him; accordingly, as soon as we could  make ourselves ready, we got into his carriage and he set off in the  direction of Carthage. Having gone a short distance, he observed to us  that his brother Joseph Smith, the Prophet, had received a revelation  on marriage, that was not for the public yet, which he would rehearse  to us, as he had taken pains to commit it to memory. He then commenced  rehearsing the revelation on celestial marriage not stopping till he  had gone quite through with the matter. After which he reviewed that  part pertaining to plurality of wives, dwelling at some length upon the  same, in order that we might clearly understand the principle. And on  the same day (July 22, 1843,) he sealed my wife, formerly Martha Jane  Knowlton, to me; and when I heard the revelation on celestial marriage  read on the stand in Salt Lake City, in 1852, I recognized it as the  same as that repeated to me by Brother Hyrum Smith. Not long after  this I was present when Brother David Fullmer and wife were sealed by  Brother Hyrum Smith, the martyred Patriarch, according to the law of  celestial marriage. And, besides the foregoing, there was quite enough  came within the compass of my observation to have fully satisfied my  mind that plural marriage was practiced in the city of Nauvoo.                                                            Howard Coray.    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 18th day of June, A.D. 1882.    [Seal.]                                              James Jack, Notary Public.      AFFIDAVIT OF DAVID FULLMER[5]    Territory of Utah, County of Salt Lake. ss.    Be it remembered that on this fifteenth day of June, A.D. 1869,  personally appeared before me, James Jack, a notary public in and for  said county, David Fullmer, who was by me sworn in due form of law,  and upon his oath saith, that on or about the 12th day of August,  A.D. 1843, while in meeting with the High Council [he being a member  thereof] in Hyrum Smith's brick office, in the City of Nauvoo, County  of Hancock, State of Illinois, Dunbar Wilson made inquiry in relation  to the subject of plurality of wives, as there were rumors about  respecting it, and he was satisfied there was something in those  rumors, and he wanted to know what it was. Upon which Hyrum Smith  stepped across the road to his residence, and soon returned bringing  with him a copy of the revelation on celestial marriage given to Joseph  Smith July 12, 1843, and read the same to the High Council, and bore  testimony to its truth. The said David Fullmer further saith that,  to the best of his memory and belief, the following named persons  were present: William Marks, Austin A. Cowles, Samuel Bent, George  W. Harris, Dunbar Wilson, William Huntington, Levi Jackman, Aaron  Johnson, Thomas Grover, David Fullmer, Phineas Richards, James Allred  and Leonard Soby. And the said David Fullmer further saith that William  Marks, Austin A. Cowles and Leonard Soby were the only persons present  who did not receive the testimony of Hyrum Smith, and that all the  others did receive it from the teachings and testimony of the said  Hyrum Smith; and further, that the copy of said revelation on celestial  marriage published in the _Deseret News_ extra of September 14, A.D.,  1852, is a true copy of the same.                                                            David Fullmer.    Subscribed and sworn to by the said David Fullmer the day and year  first above written.    [Seal.]                                                James Jack, Notary Public.      AFFIDAVIT OF LEONARD SOBY[6]    Be it remembered that on the 23rd day of March, in the year 1886,  before, Joshua W. Roberts, notary public for the City of Beverly,  County of Burlington, State of New Jersey, Leonard Soby, of said city,  county and state, was by me duly sworn, and upon his oath saith:    That on or about the 12th day of August, 1843, I was a resident of  Nauvoo, Hancock County, State of Illinois, and being a member of the  High Council of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was  present at a meeting of said council at the time herein above stated;  Thomas Grover, Alpheus Cutler, David Fullmer, William Huntington and  others; when Elder Hyrum Smith, after certain explanations, read the  revelation on celestial marriage.    I have read and examined carefully said revelation, since published  in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants of said Church, and say to the  best of my knowledge and belief it is the same, word for word, as the  revelation then read by Hyrum Smith.    The deponent says further, that the revelation did not originate with  Brigham Young, as some persons have falsely stated, but was received by  the Prophet Joseph Smith, and read in the High Council by his authority  as a revelation to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    When read to this deponent and said High Council, I believed it was a  revelation from Jesus Christ, and I believe so now.                                                              Leonard Soby.    Subscribed and sworn to by the said Leonard Soby the day and year first  above written.                                          Joshua W. Roberts, Notary Public.    Witnessed by:    James H. Hart,    Samuel Harrison.      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN W. RIGDON    State of Utah, County of Salt Lake. ss.    John W. Rigdon, being duly sworn, says: I am the son of Sidney Rigdon,  deceased. Was born at Mentor, in the State of Ohio, in the year 1830,  and am now over seventy-five years of age. My father, Sidney Rigdon,  joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that year,  and was in 1833 ordained to be Joseph Smith's first counselor which  position he held up to the time Joseph the Prophet was killed, at  Carthage jail, in 1844. That Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon moved from  Kirtland, with their families, to the State of Missouri, during the  winter of 1837, but Rigdon did not reach Far West, in the State of  Missouri, until the last of April, 1838. That during the troubles in  Missouri, in the year 1838, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, his brother,  Sidney Rigdon, Lyman Wight and others, whose names I do not now  remember were arrested and imprisoned in Liberty jail, about forty  miles from the village of Far West, in Caldwell County, Missouri, where  they all remained incarcerated for several months. That while said  Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Lyman Wight and others were  prisoners in said Liberty jail, as aforesaid I, with my mother, wife  of Sidney Rigdon, Emma Smith, wife of said Joseph Smith, and Joseph  Smith, son of Joseph and Emma Smith, went to see the said prisoners  during the latter part of the winter of 1838. We all went together in  the same carriage and came home together. We stayed at Liberty jail  with the prisoners three days and then left for home. The story that  is being told by some of the members of the Reorganized Church, at  Lamoni, that young Joseph Smith, now president of the said Reorganized  Church, was ordained by his father, Joseph Smith, to be the leader of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after his father's  death, is not true, for I know that no such ordination took place while  we were at Liberty jail; that if any such ordination had taken place I  most certainly should have known it and remembered it, as I was with  young Joseph, the Prophet's son, all the time we were there. If Joseph  Smith had ordained his son Joseph to be the leader of the Church at his  death, he would have done so in a manner that there could have been  no doubt about it. Both of his counselors were then in prison with  him, namely, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith, and it would have been in  order for the prophet to have called upon them to assist him in such  an ordination had it taken place, and a record of the same made in the  Church books, so that all members of the Church might have known that  such an ordination had taken place. But nothing of the kind appears in  the Church books. My father and mother lived a good many years after  the incarceration at Liberty jail, and I, who lived near my father,  never heard my father or my mother mention that such an ordination  ever took place in Liberty jail; and as I know myself that no such  ordination took place in Liberty jail, and inasmuch as it is not  claimed that an ordination of this character was bestowed at any other  place, therefore I deny it as an untruth and a story gotten up by the  Reorganized Church for effect.    Besides all this, if Joseph Smith, the President of the Reorganized  Church was ordained while in Liberty jail, why did he, sixteen years  after his father's death, receive an ordination under the hands of  William Marks, William W. Blair, and Zenas H. Gurley? Would it not seem  that one ordination (and that too, said to have been by his own father,  the President of the Church) should have been sufficient? But further  Wm. Marks, Wm. W. Blair and Zenas H. Gurley had all been excommunicated  from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (excepting William  W. Blair, who never belonged to it) before they \"ordained\" young  Joseph to be President of the Reorganized Church, and therefore they  did not have the authority to ordain him. The whole story of his being  ordained by anyone having authority to do so is too preposterous to be  entertained for a single moment, and should be rejected by all who hear  such a story mentioned.    As to the truth of the doctrine of polygamy being introduced by the  Prophet Joseph Smith, deponent further says: Joseph Smith was absolute  so far as spiritual figures were concerned, and no man would have dared  to introduce the doctrine of polygamy or any other new doctrine into  the \"Mormon\" Church at the city of Nauvoo during the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#19)"],[1,"stakes, the most notable  being the Brigham Young University of Provo, the Brigham Young College  of Logan, and the Latter-day Saints University of Salt Lake City. Old  folks' committees, for the entertainment of the aged, regardless of  sect or creed, are another institution of the Church, and are found in  most of the stakes and wards throughout Zion.    For further information on Priesthood and Church government, the reader  is referred to D&C 20,68,84,107,112, and 114 of the Doctrine and  Covenants; also to the \"History of the Church,\" Volume III, page 385:  and Volume IV, page 207.        The Gospel Dispensations    CHAPTER I.    Introductory    One Plan of Salvation.--As there is but one Savior, so is there but one  plan of salvation. There never was, and there never can be, another  \"I marvel,\" wrote Paul to the back-sliding Galatians, \"that ye are so  soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto  another gospel; which is not another; but there be some that trouble  you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel  from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have  preached unto you, let him be accursed.\"--(Galatians 1:6-8.)    For All Men.--The Gospel of Christ is not of any one place, nor of  any one period. Neither is it for the salvation of any class, to the  exclusion of other classes. It is for all men, and was made plain  and simple, that it might appeal to all. At the same time, it is the  mightiest, the sublimest, and the most profound system of philosophy  that the world has ever known. It is not a child of earth, nor a  product of human wisdom. It came out of eternity, from the very bosom  of God, and has been upon the earth at different times and places. It  is the Everlasting Gospel, the same yesterday, today, and forever, and  all true principles of religion, science, or philosophy, now popular in  the world, are but parts of it--broken off fragments of this grand Rock  of Ages. Or, to change the figure, they are as pools of water, caught  in the clefts and hollows of time, when the great flood of Truth, in  one or more of its visitations, swept by on its way back to the eternal  ocean.    All Truth Divine.--Every religion in existence that has benefited its  believers, must have possessed at some period a portion of divine  truth; and that truth is what perpetuated it, not the errors associated  therewith. These are as cobwebs and dust, the accumulated rubbish of  false tradition, in which the precious jewel is wholly or in part  concealed. Yes, every religion, Christian or Pagan, that has proved a  real blessing to its votaries, is as a cistern holding within it waters  once wholesome and pure,--waters that fell originally from heaven,  in one of those grand spiritual showers, called dispensations of the  gospel, when the flood gates of eternity were lifted, that the world  might be refreshed.    The Arab and the Caliph.--But spiritual waters, like the waters of  earth, will lose their sweetness and purity, if separated too far  and too long from their fountain-head. They will become stagnant and  unwholesome, like the water carried for many days by the poor Arab in  his leathern bottle, from the sparkling spring in the desert to the  distant palace of the Caliph, who magnanimously rewarded the giver, not  for the rank draught presented for his acceptance, but for the goodness  of his motive, the sincerity of his soul.    God's Word Apportioned.--How every tribe and nation receives its  portion of the divine word, is thus told in the Nephite record:    \"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I  might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake  the earth, and cry repentance unto every people:    \"Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder,  repentance, and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and  come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the  face of the earth.    \"But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be  content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.    \"I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm decree of a just God,  for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether  it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto  men, according to their wills; whether they be unto salvation or unto  destruction.    \"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; or he  that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good  and evil, to him it is given according to his desires; whether he  desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.    \"Now seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to  perform the work to which I have been called?    \"Why should I desire that I was an angel, that I could speak unto all  the ends of the earth?    \"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation  and tongue, to teach his word; yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit  that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in  wisdom, according to that which is just and true.\"--(Alma 29:1-8.)    An Oft-Restored Religion.--The Gospel of Christ did not make its first  appearance upon this planet at the time of the Savior's crucifixion.  While it seemed a new thing to that generation--for they were  \"astonished at the doctrine\" of the Nazarene, who taught them the  return of good for evil as a better rule of conduct than the Mosaic law  of retaliation--in reality it was older than all the ages, older than  the earth itself. It might have said, with its divine Author: \"Before  Abraham was I am\"--with reference to the mortal life of Abraham.  Originating in the heavens, before this world was created, the gospel,  prior to its preaching in the meridian of time, had been revealed to  man in a series of dispensations, beginning with Adam and extending  down to that day. The ancient apostles of our Lord preached a restored  gospel, just as much as do the apostles, seventies, and elders of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    \"Dispensation\" Defined.--It is time to ask, and to more fully answer  the question, What is meant by the term \"dispensation\"? To dispense  is to deal out or distribute, as when the sacrament of the Lord's  Supper is dispensed to a congregation. \"Dispensation of Providence\"  is a phrase used to describe some dealing of God with man, either for  joy or sorrow to the object of the visitation. In theology the term  \"Dispensation\" signifies the method or scheme by which God has at  different times developed his purposes and revealed himself to man.  It also denotes a period marked by some particular development of the  divine purpose and revelation, such as the Mosaic dispensation, lasting  from Moses to Christ: or the Christian dispensation, ending in a  universal apostasy which rendered necessary the latter-day restoration  of the gospel and the Priesthood.    Seven Periods.--It is held by many that there are seven gospel  dispensations, seven distinct periods, during which the plan of  salvation, restored from heaven to earth, has been administered to the  children of men; the intervals of spiritual darkness between those  periods of light resulting from the world's unworthiness. Revelation,  so far as I am aware, is silent as to the number of the dispensations;  but I am among those who incline to the belief that seven is  correct; a belief probably founded, in part, upon the scriptural or  symbolical character of that number, and upon the Prophet Joseph's  teaching relative to the seven periods, answering to the seven seals  of the mystical book seen by John the Revelator in his vision on  Patmos.--(Rev. 5 and 6.)    The Apocalyptic Book.--Section Seventy-Seven of the Doctrine and  Covenants is a key to John's revelation, consisting of a series of  questions and answers; those germane to this subject being as follows:    \"What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed  on the back with seven seals?\"    \"We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries,  and works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this  earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its  temporal existence.\"    \"What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed?\"    \"We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the  first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years,  and so on until the seventh.\"    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned  in the 8th chapter of Revelations?\"    \"We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on  the seventh day he finished his work, and sanctified it, and also  formed man out of the dust of the earth; even so, in the beginning of  the seventh thousand years will the Lord God sanctify the earth, and  complete the salvation of man, and judge all things, and shall redeem  all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when  he shall have sealed all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of  the seven angels, are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the  beginning of the seventh thousand years;--the preparing of the way  before the time of his coming.\"    Whether or not these seven periods are looked upon as gospel  dispensation, it is interesting to consider them as covering the same  ground, paralleling, or extending through, the same mighty stretch of  duration, and dealing with events, epochs, personages and principles  connected with those dispensations.    The World's Real History.--Concerning \"the book which John saw,\" the  Prophet says in effect that it represents the real history of the  world--what the eye of God has seen, what the recording angel has  written. The seven thousand years,"]]]
