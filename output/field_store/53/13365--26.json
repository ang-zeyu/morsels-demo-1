Meanwhile the bird  population does not decrease. Every place in nature, like every property in  Chancery, has more than one claimant to it--sometimes the claimants are  many--and so long as the dispute lasts all live out of the estate. For  there are always two or more species subsisting on the same kind of  food, possessing similar habits, and frequenting the same localities. It  is consequently impossible for man to exterminate any one species  without indirectly benefiting some other species, which attracts him in  a less degree, or not at all. This is unfortunate, for as the bright  kinds, or those we esteem most, diminish in numbers the less interesting  kinds multiply, and we lose much of the pleasure which bird life is  fitted to give us. When we visit woods, or other places to which birds  chiefly resort, in districts uninhabited by man, or where he pays little  or no attention to the feathered creatures, the variety of the bird life  encountered affords a new and peculiar delight. There is a constant  succession of new forms and new voices; in a single day as many species  may be met with as one would find in England by searching diligently for  a whole year.    And yet this may happen in a district possessing no more species than  England boasts; and the actual number of individuals may be even less  than with us. In sparrows, for instance, of the one common species, we  are exceedingly rich; but in bird life generally, in variety of birds,  especially in those of graceful forms and beautiful plumage, we have  been growing poorer for the last fifty years, and have now come to so  low a state that it becomes us to inquire whether it is not in our power  to better ourselves. It is an old familiar truth--a truism--that it is  easier to destroy than to restore or build up; nevertheless, some  comfort is to be got from the reflection that in this matter we have up  till now been working against Nature. She loves not to bring forth food  where there are none to thrive on it; and when our unconsidered action  had made these gaps, when, despising her gifts or abusing them, we had  destroyed or driven out her finer kinds, she fell back on her lowlier  kinds--her reserve of coarser, more generalized species--and gave them  increase, and bestowed the vacant places which we had created on them.  What she has done she will undo, or assist us in undoing; for we should  be going back to her methods, and should have her with and not against  us. Much might yet be done to restore the balance among our native  species. Not by legislation, albeit all laws restraining the wholesale  destruction of bird life are welcome. On this subject the Honourable  Auberon Herbert has said, and his words are golden: \"For myself,  legislation or no legislation, I would turn to the friends of animals in  this country, and say, 'If you wish that the friendship between man and  animals should become a better and truer thing than it is at present,  you must make it so by countless individual efforts, by making thousands  of centres of personal influence.'\"    The subject is a large one. In this paper the question of the  introduction of exotic birds will be chiefly considered. Birds have been  blown by the winds of chance over the whole globe, and have found rest  for their feet. That a large number of species, suited to the conditions  of this country, exist scattered about the world is not to be doubted,  and by introducing a few of these we might accelerate the change so  greatly to be desired. At present a very considerable amount of energy  is spent in hunting down the small contingents of rare species that once  inhabited our islands, and still resort annually to its shores,  persistently endeavouring to re-establish their colonies. A less amount  of labour and expense would serve to introduce a few foreign species  each year, and the reward would be greater, and would not make us  ashamed. We have generously given our own wild animals to other  countries; and from time to time we receive cheering reports of an  abundant increase in at least two of our exportations--to wit, the  rabbit and the sparrow. We are surely entitled to some return. Dead  animals, however rich their pelt or bright their plumage may be, are not  a fair equivalent. Dead things are too much with us. London has become a  mart for this kind of merchandise for the whole of Europe, and the  traffic is not without a reflex effect on us; for life in the inferior  animals has come or is coming to be merely a thing to be lightly taken  by human hands, in order that its dropped garment may be sold for filthy  lucre. There are warehouses in this city where it is possible for a  person to walk ankle-deep--literally to wade--in bright-plumaged  bird-skins, and see them piled shoulder-high on either side of him--a  sight to make the angels weep!    Not the angel called woman. It is not that she is naturally more cruel  than man; bleeding wounds and suffering in all its forms, even the sigh  of a burdened heart, appeal to her quick sympathies, and draw the ready  tears; but her imagination helps her less. The appeal must in most cases  be direct and through the medium of her senses, else it is not seen and  not heard. If she loves the ornament of a gay-winged bird, and is able  to wear it with a light heart, it is because it calls up no mournful  image to her mind; no little tragedy enacted in some far-off wilderness,  of the swift child of the air fallen and bleeding out its bright life,  and its callow nestlings, orphaned of the breast that warmed them, dying  of hunger in the tree. We know, at all events, that out of a female  population of many millions in this country, so far only ten women,  possibly fifteen, have been found to raise their voices--raised so often  and so loudly on other questions--to protest against the barbarous and  abhorrent fashion of wearing slain birds as ornaments. The degrading  business of supplying the demand for this kind of feminine adornment  must doubtless continue to flourish in our midst, commerce not being  compatible with morality, but the material comes from other lands,  unblessed as yet with Wild Bird Protection Acts, and \"individual  efforts, and thousands of centres of personal influence\"; it comes  mainly from the tropics, where men have brutish minds and birds a  brilliant plumage. This trade, therefore, does not greatly affect the  question of our native bird life, and the consideration of the means,  which may be within our reach, of making it more to us than it now is.  Some species from warm and even hot climates have been found to thrive  well in England, breeding in the open air; as, for instance, the black  and the black-necked swans, the Egyptian goose, the mandarin and summer  ducks, and others too numerous to mention. But these birds are  semi-domestic, and are usually kept in enclosures, and that they can  stand the climate and propagate when thus protected from competition is  not strange; for we know that several of our hardy domestic birds--the  fowl, pea-fowl, Guinea-fowl, and Muscovy duck--are tropical in their  origin. Furthermore, they are all comparatively large, and if they ever  become feral in England, it will not be for many years to come.    That these large kinds thrive so well with us is an encouraging fact;  but the question that concerns us at present is the feasibility of  importing birds of the grove, chiefly of the passerine order, and  sending them forth to give a greater variety and richness to our bird  life. To go with such an object to tropical countries would only be to  court failure. Nature's highest types, surpassing all others in  exquisite beauty of form, brilliant colouring, and perfect melody, can  never be known to our woods and groves. These rarest avian gems may not  be removed from their setting, and to those who desire to know them in  their unimaginable lustre, it will always be necessary to cross oceans  and penetrate into remote wildernesses. We must go rather to regions  where the conditions of life are hard, where winters are long and often  severe, where Nature is not generous in the matter of food, and the  mouths are many, and the competition great. Nor even from such regions  could we take any strictly migratory species with any prospect of  success. Still, limiting ourselves to the resident, and consequently to  the hardiest kinds, and to those possessing only a partial migration, it  is surprising to find how many there are to choose from, how many are  charming melodists, and how many have the bright tints in which our  native species are so sadly lacking. The field from which the supply can  be drawn is very extensive, and includes the continent of Europe, the  countries of North Asia, a large portion of North America and Antarctic  America, or South Chili and Patagonia. It would not be going too far to  say that for every English species, inhabiting the garden, wood, field,  stream, or waste, at least half a dozen resident species, with similar  habits, might be obtained from the countries mentioned which would be  superior to our own in melody (the nightingale and lark excepted),  bright plumage, grace of form, or some other attractive quality. The  question then arises; What reason is there for believing that these  exotics, imported necessarily in small numbers, would succeed in winning  a footing in our country, and become a permanent addition to its  avifauna? For it has been admitted that our species are not few, in  spite of the losses that have been suffered, and that the bird  population does not diminish, however much its character may have  altered and deteriorated from the aesthetic point of view, and probably  also from the utilitarian. There are no vacant places.

Even more wonderful in their  resemblance to life were the eyes, which seemed to return my  half-fearful glances with a calm, questioning scrutiny I found it hard  to endure. I hurried on after my guide without speaking, but when I got  to the middle of the room I paused involuntarily once more, so  profoundly did one of the statues impress me. It was of a woman of a  majestic figure and proud, beautiful face, with an abundance of  silvery-white hair. She sat bending forward with her eyes fixed on mine  as I advanced, one hand pressed to her bosom, while with the other she  seemed in the act of throwing back her white unbound tresses from her  forehead. There was, I thought, a look of calm, unbending pride on the  face, but on coming closer this expression disappeared, giving place to  one so wistful and pleading, so charged with subtle pain, that I stood  gazing like one fascinated, until Yoletta took my hand and gently drew  me away. Still, in spite of the absorbing nature of the matter on which  I was bound, that strange face continued to haunt me, and glancing up  and down through that long array of calm-browed, beautiful women, I  could see no one that was like it.    Arrived at the end of the gallery, we ascended the broad stone steps,  and came to a landing twenty or thirty feet above the level of the floor  we had traversed. Here Yoletta pushed a glass door aside and ushered me  into another apartment--the Mother's Room. It was spacious, and, unlike  the gallery, well-lighted; the air in it was also warm and balmy, and  seemed charged with a subtle aroma. But now my whole attention was  concentrated on a group of persons before me, and chiefly on its central  figure--the woman I had so much desired to see. She was seated, leaning  back in a somewhat listless attitude, on a very large, low, couch-like  seat, covered with a soft, violet-colored material. My very first glance  at her face revealed to me that she differed in appearance and  expression from other inmates of the house: one reason was that she was  extremely pale, and bore on her worn countenance the impress of  long-continued suffering; but that was not all. She wore her hair, which  fell unbound on her shoulders, longer than the others, and her eyes  looked larger, and of a deeper green. There was something wonderfully  fascinating to me in that pale, suffering face, for, in spite of  suffering, it was beautiful and loving; but dearer than all these things  to my mind were the marks of passion it exhibited, the petulant, almost  scornful mouth, and the half-eager, half-weary expression of the eyes,  for these seemed rather to belong to that imperfect world from which I  had been severed, and which was still dear to my unregenerate heart. In  other respects also she differed from the rest of the women, her dress  being a long, pale-blue robe, embroidered with saffron-colored flowers  and foliage down the middle, and also on the neck and the wide sleeves.  On the couch at her side sat the father of the house, holding her hand  and talking in low tones to her; two of the young women sat at her feet  on cushions, engaged on embroidery work, while another stood behind her;  one of the young men was also there, and was just now showing her a  sketch, and apparently explaining something in it.    I had expected to find a sick, feeble lady, in a dimly-lighted chamber,  with perhaps one attendant at her side; now, coming so unexpectedly  before this proud-looking, beautiful woman, with so many about her, I  was completely abashed, and, feeling too confused to say anything, stood  silent and awkward in her presence.    \"This is our stranger, Chastel,\" said the old man to her, at the same  time bestowing an encouraging look on me.    She turned from the sketch she had been studying, and raising herself  slightly from her half-recumbent attitude, fixed her dark eyes on me  with some interest.    \"I do not see why you were so much impressed,\" she remarked after a  while. \"There is nothing very strange in him after all.\"    I felt my face grow hot with shame and anger, for she seemed to look on  me and speak of me--not to me--as if I had been some strange, semi-human  creature, discovered in the woods, and brought in as a great curiosity.    \"No; it was not his countenance, only his curious garments and his words  that astonished us,\" said the father in reply.    She made no answer to this, but presently, addressing me directly, said:  \"You were a long time in the house before you expressed a wish to see  me.\"    I found my speech then--a wretched, hesitating speech, for which I hated  myself--and replied, that I had asked to be allowed to see her as soon  as I had been informed of her existence.    She turned on the father a look of surprise and inquiry.    \"You must remember, Chastel,\" said he, \"that he comes to us from some  strange, distant island, having customs different from ours--a thing I  had never heard of before. I can give you no other explanation.\"    Her lip curled, and then, turning to me, she continued: \"If there are  houses in your island without mothers in them, it is not so elsewhere in  the world. That you went out to travel so poorly provided with knowledge  is a marvel to us; and as I have had the pain of telling you this, I  must regret that you ever left your own home.\"    I could make no reply to these words, which fell on me like  whip-strokes; and looking at the other faces, I could see no sympathy in  them for me; as they looked at her--their mother--and listened to her  words, the expression they wore was love and devotion to her only,  reminding me a little of the angel faces on Guide's canvas of the  \"Coronation of the Virgin.\"    \"Go now,\" she presently added in a petulant tone; \"I am tired, and wish  to rest\"; and Yoletta, who had been standing silently by me all the  time, took my hand and led me from the room.    With eyes cast down I passed through the gallery, paying no attention to  its strange, stony occupants; and leaving my gentle conductress without  a word at the door of the music-room, I hurried away from the house. For  I could feel love and compassion in the touch of the dear girl's hand,  and it seemed to me that if she had spoken one word, my overcharged  heart would have found vent in tears. I only wished to be alone, to  brood in secret on my pain and the bitterness of defeat; for it was  plain that the woman I had so wished to see, and, since seeing her, so  wished to be allowed to love, felt towards me nothing but contempt and  aversion, and that from no fault of my own, she, whose friendship I most  needed, was become my enemy in the house.    My steps took me to the river. Following its banks for about a mile, I  came at last to a grove of stately old trees, and there I seated myself  on a large twisted root projecting over the water. To this sequestered  spot I had come to indulge my resentful feelings; for here I could speak  out my bitterness aloud, if I felt so minded, where there were no  witnesses to hear me. I had restrained those unmanly tears, so nearly  shed in Yoletta's presence, and kept back by dark thoughts on the way;  now I was sitting quietly by myself, safe from observation, safe even  from that sympathy my bruised spirit could not suffer.    Scarcely had I seated myself before a great brown animal, with black  eyes, round and fierce, rose to the surface of the stream half a dozen  yards from my feet; then quickly catching sight of me, it plunged  noisily again under water, breaking the clear image reflected there with  a hundred ripples. I waited for the last wavelet to fade away, but when  the surface was once more still and smooth as dark glass, I began to be  affected by the profounded silence and melancholy of nature, and by a  something proceeding from nature--phantom, emanation, essence, I know  not what. My soul, not my sense, perceived it, standing with finger on  lips, there, close to me; its feet resting on the motionless water,  which gave no reflection of its image, the clear amber sunlight passing  undimmed through its substance. To my soul its spoken \"Hush!\" was  audible, and again, and yet again, it said \"Hush!\" until the tumult in  me was still, and I could not think my own thoughts. I could thereafter  only listen, breathless, straining my senses to catch some natural  sound, however faint. Far away in the dim distance, in some blue  pasture, a cow was lowing, and the recurring sound passed me like the  humming flight of an insect, then fainter still, like an imagined sound,  until it ceased. A withered leaf fell from the tree-top; I heard it  fluttering downwards, touching other leaves in its fall until the silent  grass received it. Then, as I listened for another leaf, suddenly from  overhead came the brief gushing melody of some late singer, a robin-like  sound, ringing out clear and distinct as a flourish on a clarionet:  brilliant, joyous, and unexpected, yet in keeping with that melancholy  quiet, affecting the mind like a spray of gold and scarlet embroidery on  a pale, neutral ground. The sun went down, and in setting, kindled the  boles of the old trees here and there into pillars of red fire, while  others in deeper shade looked by contrast like pillars of ebony; and  wherever the foliage was thinnest, the level rays shining through  imparted to the sere leaves a translucence and splendor that was like  the stained glass in the windows of some darkening cathedral. All along  the river a white mist began to rise, a slight wind sprang up and the  vapor drifted, drowning the reeds and bushes, and wreathing its ghostly  arms about the old trees: and watching the mist, and listening to the  \"hallowed airs and symphonies\" whispered by the low wind, I felt that  there was no longer any anger in my heart. Nature, and something in and  yet more than nature, had imparted her \"soft influences\" and healed"]]]
