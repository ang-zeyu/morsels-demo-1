The wind made strange noises in the branches high above him,  and all the trees seemed to be leaning over and trying to speak to  him. He felt somewhat sorry that he had come, but when he thought of  the Ongloc he mustered up courage and went on until he found an open  space between two high trees.    He stopped here and dug a hole under each of the trees. Then he put his  feet in the notches and climbed one of the trees. It was hard work,  for the notches were far apart; but at last he reached the branches  and climbed to the top. The wind rocked the tree and made him dizzy,  but he reached the highest cocoanut, threw it to the ground, and then  'started down the tree. It was easy to come down, though he went  too fast and slipped and slid some distance, skinning his arms and  legs. He did not mind that, however, for he knew he had the cocoanut  that would capture the Ongloc. He picked it up, chopped off the husk,  punched in one of the little eyes, and whispered inside:      \"Ongloc of the mountains!  Ongloc! Ugly man!  I'm a little cocoanut,  Catch me if you can!\"      He then chopped it in halves and buried one piece, and, running  to the other tree, buried the remaining piece. Just as he finished  he thought he heard a noise in the grove, and, instead of walking,  he started to run as fast as he could.    It was very dark now, and the noise grew louder and made him run  faster and faster, until suddenly a dreadful scream sounded directly in  front of him, and a terrible black thing with fiery eyes came flying  at him. He turned in terror and ran back toward the trees. He knew it  was the Ongloc answering the call of the cocoanut, and he ran like mad,  but the monster had seen him and flew after him, screaming with rage.    Faster and faster he ran, but nearer and nearer sounded the frightful  screams until, just as he felt two huge claws close on his neck, there  was a bump, a loud snap, and he felt himself being carried high in the  air. When the shock was over he found that he was squeezed tightly  between two hard walls, and he could hear the Ongloc screaming and  tearing at the outside with his claws. Then he knew what had happened.    He had crossed the line between the buried pieces and they had snapped  on him and carried him up the tree from which they came. He was badly  squeezed but he felt safe from the Ongloc, who finally went away in  disappointment; for, although he likes cocoanuts, he cannot take one  from a tree, but must change a boy or girl into the fruit if he wishes  to eat of it.    Quicoy waited a long, long time and then knocked on the shell in the  hope that some one would hear him. All that night and the next day  and the next he knocked and cried and knocked, but, though people  passed under the tree and found the bolo, he was so high up they did  not hear him.    Days and weeks went by and the people wondered what had become of  Quicoy. Many thought he had run away and were sorry for his poor  mother, who grieved very much to think she had terrified him by calling  the Ongloc. Of course the boys who had sent him to the grove could  have told something of his whereabouts, but they were frightened and  said nothing, so no one ever heard of poor little Quicoy again.    If you pass a cocoanut grove at night you can hear a noise like some  one knocking. The older people say that the cocoanuts grow so closely  together high up in the branches that the wind, when it shakes the  tree, bumps them together. But the children know better. They say,  \"Quicoy is knocking to get out, but he must stay there a hundred  years.\"        The Passing of Loku    The tale of Loku is applied to a large, ugly lizard which climbs  to the rafters of houses and gives the peculiar cry that suggests  its name. This lizard, although hideous, is harmless; it lives on  centipedes. Its strange cry may be heard everywhere in the Philippine  Islands.    Hundreds of years ago a very wicked king named Loku ruled the  Philippines. He was cruel and unjust, and condemned to death all who  refused to do his bidding. He had vast armies and made war on all  until his name was feared everywhere.    His power was very great. He conquered every nation that opposed him  and killed so many people that the god, viewing the slaughter from  his throne above, sent an angel to order him to cease from warfare  and to rule the land in peace.    Loku was in his palace, planning an assault on his neighbors, when  a soft light filled the chamber, and a beautiful angel appeared and  delivered the mandate of the master.    The cruel king paid no heed, but dismissed the holy messenger  in scorn. \"Tell your master,\" said he, \"to deliver his message in  person. I do not deal with messengers. I am Loku. All fear my name. I  am the great Loku.\"    Hardly had he spoken when the palace shook to its foundations and a  mighty voice thundered, \"Is it thus thou Slightest my word? Thou art  Loku. All shall indeed know thy name. From every crevice thou shalt  forever cry it in a form that suits thy ill nature.\"    The courtiers, alarmed by the shock, rushed to the king's chamber,  but Loku was nowhere to be found. The royal robes lay scattered on  the floor and the only living thing to be seen was an ugly lizard  that blinked at them from among the plans on the table.    They searched far and wide, and when no trace of the king could be  found the courtiers divided the kingdom and ruled so wisely and well  that there was peace for many years.    As for Loku, you may still hear him fulfilling his punishment. From  crack and crevice, tree and shrub, he calls his name from dark till  dawn: \"Lok-u! Lok-u! Lok-u!\"    And he must cry it forever.        The Light of the Fly    The firefly abounds everywhere in the Islands.      I      The King of the Air was in terrible rage,  For some one had stolen his ring;  And every one wondered whoever could dare  To do such a terrible thing.  He called all his subjects together and said,  \"To him that shall find it I'll give  Whatever he asks, and this bounty of mine  Shall last while his family live.\"          II      Away went his good loyal subjects to search,  And no one remained but a fly.  \"Be off!\" said the King, \"go and join in the search;  Would you slight such a ruler as I?\"  Then up spoke the fly with his little wee voice:  \"The ring is not stolen,\" he said.  \"It stuck to your crown when you put it away,  And now it's on top of your head.\"        III      The King in surprise took the crown from his head,  And there, sure enough, was the ring.  \"No wonder you saw it, with so many eyes;  But what is your wish?\" said the King.  \"O King,\" said the fly, \"I work hard all the day,  And I never can go out at night.  I should like to go then and be gay with my friends,  So all that I wish is a light.\"        IV      \"You shall have it at once,\" said the gratified King,  And he fastened a light to the fly,  Who straightway returned to his home with the prize  That was worth more than money could buy.  So now you can see him at night with his light  And from him this lesson may learn:  To keep your eyes open and see the least thing,  And Fortune will come in its turn.          Mangita and Larina    This is a tale told in the lake district of Luzon. At times of rain  or in winter the waters of the Laguna de Bai rise and detach from the  banks a peculiar vegetation that resembles lettuce. These plants,  which float for months down the Pasig River, gave rise, no doubt,  to the story.    Many years ago there lived on the banks of the Laguna de Bai a poor  fisherman whose wife had died, leaving him two beautiful daughters  named Mangita and Larina.    Mangita had hair as black as night and a dark skin. She was as good  as she was beautiful, and was loved by all for her kindness. She  helped her father mend the nets and make the torches to fish with at  night, and her bright smile lit up the little nipa house like a ray  of sunshine.    Larina was fair and had long golden hair of which she was very  proud. She was different from her sister, and never helped with the  work, but spent the day combing her hair and catching butterflies. She  would catch a pretty butterfly, cruelly stick a pin through it,  and fasten it in her hair. Then she would go down to the lake to see  her reflection in the clear water, and would laugh to see the poor  butterfly struggling in pain. The people disliked her for her cruelty,  but they loved Mangita very much. This made Larina jealous, and the  more Mangita was loved, the more her sister thought evil of her.    One day a poor old woman came to the nipa house and begged for a  little rice to put in her bowl. Mangita was mending a net and Larina  was combing her hair in the doorway. When Larina saw the old woman  she spoke mockingly to her and gave her a push that made her fall  and cut her head on a sharp rock; but Mangita sprang to help her,  washed the blood away from her head, and filled her bowl with rice  from the jar in the kitchen.    The poor woman thanked her and promised never to forget her kindness,  but to her sister she spoke not a word. Larina did not care, however,  but laughed at her and mocked her as she painfully made her way again  down the road. When she had gone Mangita took Larina to task for  her cruel treatment of a stranger; but, instead of doing any good,  it only caused Larina to hate her sister all the more.    Some time afterwards the poor fisherman died. He had gone to the big  city down the river to sell his fish, and had been attacked with a  terrible sickness that was raging there.    The girls were now alone in the world.    Mangita carved pretty shells and earned enough to buy food, but,  though she begged Larina to try to help, her sister would only idle  away the time.    The terrible sickness now swept everywhere and poor Mangita, too,  fell ill. She asked Larina to nurse her, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],[0,"Ancient and Modern Physics (#2)"],[1,"gases, so on this manasic  globe there were elementary substances that took the form of  liquids, solids and gases.  Its manasic matter was differentiated  and vibrated through one octave, as the prakritic matter does on  the earth.  Its substances combined as that does.    One combination produced prana.  The prana collected, and formed  globes.  On these pranic globes the process was repeated, with  ether as the result, and the etheric globes formed.  Then the  process was repeated on the etheric globes, as the modern  scientists have discovered, and prakriti and prakritic globes  came into being.    The true diameter of the earth, the ancient Hindu books say, is  about 50,000 miles.  That is to say, the true surface of the  earth is the line of twenty-four-hour axial rotation;  the line  where gravity and apergy exactly balance;  where a moon would  have to be placed to revolve once in 86,400 seconds.  Within that  is prakriti;  without is ether.  It is also the line of no  friction, which does exist between matter of different planes.  There is friction between prakriti, between ether, between prana;  but not between ether and prana, or ether and prakriti.  Friction  is a phenomenon confined to the matter of each plane separately.  We live at the bottom of this gaseous ocean--on its floor  --21,000 miles from the surface and only 4,000 miles from the  center.  Here, in a narrow \"skin\" limited to a few miles above  and below us, is the realm of phenomena, where solid turns into  liquid and liquid into gas, or vice versa.  The lesson impressed  upon the pupil's mind by Hindu physics is that he lives far  within the earth, not on it.    There is a comparatively narrow \"skin\" of and for phenomena  within the etheric sun-globe, say the Eastern teachers, where the  etheric solids, liquids, and gases meet and mingle and  interchange.  Within this \"skin\" are all the planets--the  \"gaseous\" atmosphere of the etheric globe stretching millions of  miles beyond the outermost planetary orbit.  The earth is in this  skin or belt of etheric phenomena, and its ether is in touch with  the ether \"in manifestation\" on the etheric globe.  The sun and  other etheric globes are within the corresponding \"skin\" of  phenomena of the pranic globes.  The prana, manifesting as solid,  liquid, and gas, or in combination and in forms, is in perfect  touch with that of the etheric globe, and through that with the  prana of the earth.  That our prana is in touch with that on the  pranic globe in all its manifestations means much in metaphysics.  The same is true of the manasic globe, and of our manasa.    The great lesson the Eastern physics burns into the pupil is that  we are living not only within the prakritic earth, but within  each of the other globes as well in identically the same way and  subject to the same laws.  Our lives are not passed on one globe,  but in four globes.  It is as if one said he lived in Buffalo,  Erie county, New York, United States;  that he was a citizen of  each and subject to the laws of each.    This question of the four globes, of the four planes of matter,  of the four skins, and of the four conditions or states of all  matter and necessarily of all persons, from the purely material  standpoint, is not only the foundation of Oriental physics, but  the very essence of Oriental metaphysics--its starting-point and  corner-stone.  To one who carries with him, consciously or  unconsciously, the concrete knowledge of the physics, the  abstract teaching of the metaphysics presents no difficulty;  it  is as clear as crystal.  But without the physical teaching the  metaphysical is not translatable.    Our Western physics teaches that physical matter is divided into  two kinds prakriti (commonly called \"physical matter\") and ether;  that the differences of each of the elementary prakritic  substances (iron, copper, sulphur, oxygen) are in their  molecules, the fundamental atom being the same;  that each of  these elementary substances vibrates only through one octave,  though on different keys;  that it changes from solid to liquid  and gas as the rate of vibration is increased and from gas to  liquid and solid as its vibration is decreased within its octave;  that the ether obeys identical laws;  that it has elementary  substances vibrating through one octave only, and that these are  solids, liquids, or gases on the etheric plane as prakriti is on  this;  that these etheric substances change and combine in every  way that prakriti does;  and that while all our prakritic  substances vibrate within (say) fifty simply octaves, the lowest  vibration of etheric matter begins over one thousand octaves  beyond our highest, making a gulf to leap.  The Eastern physics  presents this with a wealth of detail that dazes the Western  student, and then adds:  \"But beyond the etheric plane (or  octave) of vibration for matter there is a third plane (or  octave) of vibration called prana and beyond that a fourth called  manasa.  What is true of one plane is true of the other three.  One law governs the four.  As above so below.  There is no real  gulf;  there is perfect continuity.\"    The Western scientist teaches as the foundation of modern physics  that \"each and every atom of prakritic matter is the center of an  etheric molecule of many atoms;\"  that \"no two prakritic atoms  touch,\" although their etheric envelopes or atmospheres do touch;  and that \"all physical phenomena are caused by the chording  vibration of the prakritic atom and its envelope of ether,\" each  \"sounding the same note hundreds of octaves apart.\"  The \"solid  earth\" with its atmosphere represents the atom with its ether.  As all the oxygen and hydrogen do not combine to make the drop of  water, some remaining in mechanical union to give it an  atmosphere, and about one-fourth of its bulk being gas, so the  atom formed of the ether does not use all the ether in its  chemical union, retaining some in mechanical union for its  envelope or atmosphere.    The Hindu physics goes much farther along this road.  It says  that, when the pranic globes were formed, each atom of prana had  its manasic envelope--was the center of a manasic molecule.  When the etheric globes formed, each atom of ether was the center  of a pranic molecule, each atom of which was surrounded with  manasa.  When the prakriti was formed from the ether, each and  every atom of prakriti had the triple etheric-pranic-manasic  envelope.  \"Each and every prakritic atom is the center of an  etheric molecule,\" says our Western science;  but that of the  East adds this:  \"And each atom of that etheric molecule is the  center of a pranic molecule, and each atom of prana in that  pranic molecule is the center of a manasic molecule.\"  The four  great globes of matter in the material universe are represented  and reproduced in each and every atom of prakriti, which is in  touch with each one of the four globes and a part of it.  The  same is true of any aggregation of prakriti--of the earth itself  and of all things in it, including man.  As there are four  atoms in each one, so there are four earths, four globes,  consubstantial, one for each of the four elements, and in touch  with it.  One is formed of prakritic atoms--the globe we know;  another, of the ether forming their envelopes;  another, of the  prana envelopes of ether, and a fourth of the manasa around the  pranic atom.  They are not \"skins\";  they are consubstantial.  And what is true of atoms or globes is true of animals.  Each has  four \"material\" bodies, with each body on the corresponding globe  --whether of the earth or of the Universe.  This is the physical  basis of the famous \"chain of seven globes\" that is such a  stumbling-block in Hindu metaphysics.  The spirit passes through  four to get in and three to get out--seven in all.  The Hindu  understands without explanation.  He understands his physics.    The Hindu physics teaches, with ours, that \"the ether is the  source of all energy,\" but, it adds, \"as prana is the source of  all life, and manasa of all mind.\"    \"When the prakritic atom is vibrating in chord with its etheric  envelope,\" say our textbooks, \"we have physical phenomena  --light, heat, electricity.\"  \"Yes,\" says the Hindu teacher;  \"but  when the atom and its ether and its prana are vibrating in chord,  we have life and vital phenomena added to the energy.  When the  atom and its ether, prana, and manasa are vibrating in chord, we  have mind and mental phenomena added to the life and energy.\"  Each atom has energy, life, and mind in posse.  In the living  leaf the prakriti, ether, and prana are sounding the threefold  silver chord of life.  In the animal, the manasa is sounding the  same note with them, making the fourfold golden chord of mind.    Even in the plant there may be a faint manasic overtone, for  the potentiality of life and mind is in everything.  This unity  of the physical universe with the physical atom, and with all  things created--earth, animal, or crystal--is the physical  backbone of Oriental metaphysics.  Prakriti, ether, prana, and  manasa are in our vernacular the Earth, Air, Fire, and Water of  the old philosophers--the \"Four Elements.\"    The Oriental physics has been guarded most jealously.  For many  thousands of years it has been the real occult and esoteric  teaching, while the Oriental metaphysics has been open and  exoteric.  It could not be understood without the key, and the  key was in the physics known only to \"the tried and approved  disciple.\"  A little has leaked out--enough to whet the appetite  of the true student and make him ask for more.          Chapter Two    The Two Kinds of Perception      To the savage, matter appears in two forms--solid and liquid.  As he advances a step he learns it has three forms--solid,  liquid and gas.  He cannot see the gas, but he knows it is there.    A little further on he learns that matter as he knows it is only  a minute"]]]
