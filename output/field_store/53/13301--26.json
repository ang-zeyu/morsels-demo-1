The first voice he heard, he  recognized as that of the colonel.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"some of the passengers have got money. There's that  Stiefel probably carries a big sum in gold and notes. When I was  speaking of the chance of the stage being robbed, he was uncommon  nervous.\"    \"Who's Stiefel?\" was growled in another voice, which Herbert had no  difficulty in recognizing as the landlord's.    \"Oh, he's the fat, red-faced German. From his talk, I reckon he's come  out to buy mines somewhere in Colorado.\"    \"We'll save him the trouble.\"    \"So we will--good joke, John. Oh, about this Stiefel, he carries his  money in a belt round his waist. I infer that it is gold.\"    \"Good! What about the others?\"    \"There's a tall, thin man--his name is Parker,\" proceeded the colonel;  \"he's smart, or thinks he is; you'll have to pull his stockings off to  get his money. Ha, ha!\"    \"How did you find out, colonel?\" asked the landlord, in admiration.    \"Drew it out of him, sir. He didn't know who he was confiding in. He'll  wonder how the deuce his hiding place was suspected.\"    Other passengers were referred to who have not been mentioned, and in  each case the colonel was able to tell precisely where their money was  kept.    \"How about that milksop that wouldn't drink with us?\" inquired the  landlord, after a while.    \"Melville? I couldn't find out where he keeps his cash. Probably he  keeps it in his pocket. He doesn't look like a cautious man.\"    \"Who's the boy?\"    \"Only a clerk or secretary of Melville's. He hasn't any money, and isn't  worth attention.\"    \"Very glad to hear it,\" thought Herbert. \"I don't care to receive any  attention from such gentry. But who would have thought the colonel was  in league with stage robbers? I thought him a gentleman.\"    Herbert began to understand why it was that Col. Warner, if that was  his real name, had drawn the conversation to stage robbers, and artfully  managed to discover where each of the passengers kept his supply of  money. It was clear that he was in league with the landlord of the Echo  Gulch Hotel, who, it was altogether probable, intended to waylay the  stage the next day.    This was a serious condition of affairs. The time had been when, in  reading stories of adventure, Herbert had wished that he, too, might  have some experience of the kind. Now that the opportunity had come, our  hero was disposed to regard the matter with different eyes.    \"What can be done,\" he asked himself, anxiously, \"to escape the danger  which threatens us to-morrow?\"          CHAPTER XXIV. A MORNING WALK.        Herbert found it difficult to sleep from anxiety. He felt that the  burden was too great for him alone to bear, and he desired to speak on  the subject to George Melville. But there was a difficulty about doing  this undetected, on account of the thinness of the partitions between  the rooms. If he could hear Col. Warner, the latter would also be able  to hear him.    The stage was to start at seven o'clock the next morning, and before  that time some decision must be made. The first question was, should  they, or should they not, take passage, as they had anticipated?    At half-past five, Herbert, turning in bed, found his bedfellow awake.    \"Mr. Melville,\" he whispered, \"I have something important to  communicate, and cannot do so here on account of the danger of being  heard in the next room. Are you willing to dress and take a little walk  with me before breakfast?\"    George Melville's physical condition did not make him usually favorable  to early rising, but he knew Herbert well enough to understand that he  had a satisfactory reason for his request.    \"Yes, Herbert,\" he said, \"I will get up.\"    Not a word was exchanged, for Mr. Melville's discretion prevailed over  his curiosity. In ten minutes both were fully dressed and descended the  stairs.    There was no one stirring except a woman, the landlord's wife, who was  lighting the fire in order to prepare breakfast.    She regarded the two with surprise, and perhaps a little distrust.    \"You're stirrin' early, strangers,\" she said.    \"Yes,\" answered Melville, courteously, \"we are going to take a little  walk before breakfast; it may sharpen our appetites.\"    \"Humph!\" said the woman; \"that's curious. I wouldn't get up so early if  I wasn't obliged. There ain't much to see outdoors.\"    \"It is a new part of the country to us,\" said Melville, \"and we may not  have another chance to see it.\"    \"When will breakfast be ready?\" asked Herbert.    \"Half an hour, more or less,\" answered the woman, shortly.    \"We will be back in time,\" he said.    The landlady evidently thought their early-rising a singular proceeding,  but her suspicions were not aroused. She resumed her work, and Herbert  and his friend walked out through the open door.    When they had reached a spot a dozen rods or more distant, Melville  turned to his young clerk and asked:    \"Well, Herbert, what is it?\"    \"I have discovered, Mr. Melville, that our stage is to be stopped to-day  and the passengers plundered.\"    \"How did you discover this?\" asked Melville, startled.    \"By a conversation which I overheard in the next chamber to us.\"    \"But that chamber is occupied by Col. Warner.\"    \"And he is one of the conspirators,\" said Herbert, quietly.    \"Is it possible?\" ejaculated Melville. \"Can we have been so deceived in  him? Does he propose to waylay the stage?\"    \"No, I presume he will be one of the passengers.\"    \"Tell me all you know about this matter, Herbert. Who is engaged with  him in this plot?\"    \"The landlord.\"    \"I am not much surprised at this,\" said Melville, thoughtfully. \"He is  an ill-looking man, whose appearance fits the part of highwayman very  well. Then you think the colonel is in league with him?\"    \"I am sure of that. Don't you remember how skillfully Col. Warner drew  out of the passengers the hiding places of their money yesterday?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"He has told all to the landlord, and he will no doubt make use of the  knowledge. That is all, Mr. Melville. I could not rest till I had told  you, so that you might decide what to do.\"    \"It seems quite providential that you were kept awake last night,  Herbert, otherwise this blow would have come upon us unprepared. Even  with the knowledge that it impends, I hardly know what it is best for us  to do.\"    \"We might decide not to go in the stage,\" suggested Hebert.    \"But we should have to go to-morrow. We cannot stay here, and there is  no other way of traveling. As the colonel seems to think I have money,  there would be another attack to-morrow. Besides, where could we stay  except at this hotel, which is kept, as it appears, by the principal  robber.\"    \"That is true,\" said Herbert, puzzled; \"I didn't think of that.\"    \"I would quite as soon stand my chance of being robbed in the stage, as  be attacked here. Besides, I cannot make up my mind to desert my fellow  passengers. It seems cowardly to send them off to be plundered without  giving them a hint of their danger.\"    \"Couldn't we do that?\"    \"The result would be that they would not go, and there is no knowing how  long we should be compelled to remain in this secluded spot.\"    \"Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, suddenly, \"a thought has just struck me.\"    \"I hope it may show us a way out of our danger.\"    \"No, I am sorry to say that it won't do that.\"    \"What is it, Herbert?\"    \"You remember that mention was made yesterday in the stage of a certain  famous bandit named Jerry Lane?\"    \"Yes, I remember.\"    \"Do you think it is possible that he and Col. Warner may be one and the  same?\"    \"That is certainly a startling suggestion, Herbert. What reason have you  for thinking so?\"    \"It was only a guess on my part; but you remember that the colonel said  he was a man about his size.\"    \"That might be.\"    \"And he did not confine himself to the Western country, but might be met  with in New York, or St. Louis. We met the colonel in Chicago.\"    \"It may be as you surmise, Herbert,\" said George Melville, after a  pause. \"It did occur to me that our worthy landlord might be the famous  outlaw in question, but the description to which you refer seems to fit  the colonel better. There is one thing, however, that makes me a little  incredulous.\"    \"What is that, Mr. Melville?\"    \"This Jerry Lane I take to be cool and courageous, while the colonel  appears to be more of a boaster. He looks like one who can talk better  than he can act. If I had ever seen a description of his appearance, I  could judge better.\"    The two had been walking slowly and thoughtfully, when they were  startled by a rough voice.    \"You're out early, strangers?\"    Turning swiftly, they saw the dark, forbidding face of the landlord, who  had approached them unobserved.    \"Did he hear anything?\" thought Herbert, anxiously.    \"Yes, we are taking a little walk,\" said Melville, pleasantly.    \"Breakfast will be ready soon. You'd better be back soon, if you're  goin' by the stage this morning. You are goin', I reckon?\" said the  landlord, eyeing them sharply.    \"We intend to do so,\" said Melville. \"We will walk a little farther, and  then return to the house.\"    The landlord turned and retraced his steps to the Echo Gulch Hotel.    \"Do you think he heard anything that we were saying?\" asked Herbert.    \"I think not.\"    \"I wonder what brought him out here?\"    \"Probably he wanted to make sure that we were going in the stage. He  is laudably anxious to have as many victims and as much plunder as  possible.\"    \"You told him you were going in the stage?\"    \"Yes, I have decided to do so.\"    \"Have you decided upon anything else, Mr. Melville?\"    \"Not positively; but there will be time to think of that. Did you hear  where we were to be attacked?\"    \"At a point about five miles from here,\" said Herbert.    This he had gathered from the"]]]
