The seminal fluid of all animals--the prolific spirit, as  Aristotle observed, leaves their body with a bound and like a  living thing; and nature in death, as Aristotle [Footnote: De  Motu Animal., cap. 8.] further remarks, retracing her steps,  reverts to where she had set out, and returns at the end of her  course to the goal whence she had started. As animal generation  proceeds from that which is not animal, entity from nonentity,  so, by a retrograde course, entity, by corruption, is resolved  into nonentity, whence that in animals, which was last created,  fails first and that which was first, fails last.    I have also observed that almost all animals have truly a heart,  not the larger creatures only, and those that have red blood, but  the smaller, and pale-blooded ones also, such as slugs, snails,  scallops, shrimps, crabs, crayfish, and many others; nay, even in  wasps, hornets, and flies, I have, with the aid of a magnifying  glass, and at the upper part of what is called the tail, both  seen the heart pulsating myself, and shown it to many others.    But in the pale-blooded tribes the heart pulsates sluggishly and  deliberately, contracting slowly as in animals that are moribund,  a fact that may readily be seen in the snail, whose heart will be  found at the bottom of that orifice in the right side of the body  which is seen to be opened and shut in the course of respiration,  and whence saliva is discharged, the incision being made in the  upper aspect of the body, near the part which corresponds to the  liver.    This, however, is to be observed: that in winter and the colder  season, exsanguine animals, such as the snail, show no pulsation;  they seem rather to live after the manner of vegetables, or of  those other productions which are therefore designated plant-  animals.    It is also to be noted that all animals which have a heart have  also auricles, or something analogous to auricles; and, further,  that whenever the heart has a double ventricle, there are always  two auricles present, but not otherwise. If you turn to the  production of the chick in ovo, however, you will find at first  no more a vesicle or auricle, or pulsating drop of blood; it is  only by and by, when the development has made some progress, that  the heart is fashioned; even so in certain animals not destined  to attain to the highest perfection in their organization, such  as bees, wasps, snails, shrimps, crayfish, etc., we only find a  certain pulsating vesicle, like a sort of red or white  palpitating point, as the beginning or principle of their life.    We have a small shrimp in these countries, which is taken in the  Thames and in the sea, the whole of whose body is transparent;  this creature, placed in a little water, has frequently afforded  myself and particular friends an opportunity of observing the  motions of the heart with the greatest distinctness, the external  parts of the body presenting no obstacle to our view, but the  heart being perceived as though it had been seen through a  window.    I have also observed the first rudiments of the chick in the  course of the fourth or fifth day of the incubation, in the guise  of a little cloud, the shell having been removed and the egg  immersed in clear tepid water. In the midst of the cloudlet in  question there was a bloody point so small that it disappeared  during the contraction and escaped the sight, but in the  relaxation it reappeared again, red and like the point of a pin;  so that betwixt the visible and invisible, betwixt being and not  being, as it were, it gave by its pulses a kind of representation  of the commencement of life.          CHAPTER V    OF THE MOTION, ACTION AND OFFICE OF THE HEART      From these and other observations of a similar nature, I am  persuaded it will be found that the motion of the heart is as  follows:    First of all, the auricle contracts, and in the course of its  contraction forces the blood (which it contains in ample quantity  as the head of the veins, the store--house and cistern of the  blood) into the ventricle, which, being filled, the heart raises  itself straightway, makes all its fibres tense, contracts the  ventricles, and performs a beat, by which beat it immediately  sends the blood supplied to it by the auricle into the arteries.  The right ventricle sends its charge into the lungs by the vessel  which is called vena arteriosa, but which in structure and  function, and all other respects, is an artery. The left  ventricle sends its charge into the aorta, and through this by  the arteries to the body at large.    These two motions, one of the ventricles, the other of the  auricles, take place consecutively, but in such a manner that  there is a kind of harmony or rhythm preserved between them, the  two concurring in such wise that but one motion is apparent,  especially in the warmer blooded animals, in which the movements  in question are rapid. Nor is this for any other reason than it  is in a piece of machinery, in which, though one wheel gives  motion to another, yet all the wheels seem to move  simultaneously; or in that mechanical contrivance which is  adapted to firearms, where, the trigger being touched, down comes  the flint, strikes against the steel, elicits a spark, which  falling among the powder, ignites it, when the flame extends,  enters the barrel, causes the explosion, propels the ball, and  the mark is attained--all of which incidents, by reason of the  celerity with which they happen, seem to take place in the  twinkling of an eye. So also in deglutition: by the elevation of  the root of the tongue, and the compression of the mouth, the  food or drink is pushed into the fauces, when the larynx is  closed by its muscles and by the epiglottis. The pharynx is then  raised and opened by its muscles in the same way as a sac that is  to be filled is lifted up and its mouth dilated. Upon the  mouthful being received, it is forced downwards by the transverse  muscles, and then carried farther by the longitudinal ones. Yet  all these motions, though executed by different and distinct  organs, are performed harmoniously, and in such order that they  seem to constitute but a single motion and act, which we call  deglutition.    Even so does it come to pass with the motions and action of the  heart, which constitute a kind of deglutition, a transfusion of  the blood from the veins to the arteries. And if anyone, bearing  these things in mind, will carefully watch the motions of the  heart in the body of a living animal, he will perceive not only  all the particulars I have mentioned, viz., the heart becoming  erect, and making one continuous motion with its auricles; but  farther, a certain obscure undulation and lateral inclination in  the direction of the axis of the right ventricle, as if twisting  itself slightly in performing its work. And indeed everyone may  see, when a horse drinks, that the water is drawn in and  transmitted to the stomach at each movement of the throat, which  movement produces a sound and yields a pulse both to the ear and  the touch; in the same way it is with each motion of the heart,  when there is the delivery of a quantity of blood from the veins  to the arteries a pulse takes place, and can be heard within the  chest.    The motion of the heart, then, is entirely of this description,  and the one action of the heart is the transmission of the blood  and its distribution, by means of the arteries, to the very  extremities of the body; so that the pulse which we feel in the  arteries is nothing more than the impulse of the blood derived  from the heart.    Whether or not the heart, besides propelling the blood, giving it  motion locally, and distributing it to the body, adds anything  else to it--heat, spirit, perfection,--must be inquired into by--  and--by, and decided upon other grounds. So much may suffice at  this time, when it is shown that by the action of the heart the  blood is transfused through the ventricles from the veins to the  arteries, and distributed by them to all parts of the body.    The above, indeed, is admitted by all, both from the structure of  the heart and the arrangement and action of its valves. But still  they are like persons purblind or groping about in the dark, for  they give utterance to various, contradictory, and incoherent  sentiments, delivering many things upon conjecture, as we have  already shown.    The grand cause of doubt and error in this subject appears to me  to have been the intimate connexion between the heart and the  lungs. When men saw both the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary  veins losing themselves in the lungs, of course it became a  puzzle to them to know how or by what means the right ventricle  should distribute the blood to the body, or the left draw it from  the venae cavae. This fact is borne witness to by Galen, whose  words, when writing against Erasistratus in regard to the origin  and use of the veins and the coction of the blood, are the  following [Footnote: De Placitis Hippocratis et Platonis, vi.]:  \"You will reply,\" he says, \"that the effect is so; that the blood  is prepared in the liver, and is thence transferred to the heart  to receive its proper form and last perfection; a statement which  does not appear devoid of reason; for no great and perfect work  is ever accomplished at a single effort, or receives its final  polish from one instrument. But if this be actually so, then show  us another vessel which draws the absolutely perfect blood from  the heart, and distributes it as the arteries do the spirits over  the whole body.\" Here then is a reasonable opinion not allowed,  because, forsooth, besides not seeing the true means of transit,  he could not discover the vessel which should transmit the blood  from the heart to the body at large!    But had anyone been there in behalf of Erasistratus, and of that  opinion which we now espouse, and which Galen himself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#19)"],[1,"in all the East End--and this battered  thing at our feet is--Ah Fu!\"    \"Huang Chow's servant?\"    \"Exactly!\"    I stared, uncomprehendingly, and:    \"In what way does this throw light on the matter?\" I asked.    Durham--a very intelligent young officer--smiled significantly.    \"I begin to see light!\" he declared. \"The gentleman who made off just as  I arrived on the scene probably had a private quarrel with the Chinaman  and was otherwise not concerned in any way.\"    \"I am disposed to agree with you,\" I said guardedly.    \"Of course, you've no idea of his identity?\"    \"I'm afraid not.\"    \"We may find him,\" mused the officer, glancing at me shrewdly, \"by  applying at the offices of the Planet Line, but I rather doubt it. Also  I rather doubt if we'll look very far. He's saved us a lot of trouble,  but\"--peering about in the shadowy corners which abounded--\"didn't I see  somebody else lurking around here?\"    \"I'm almost certain there was someone else!\" I cried. \"In fact, I could  all but swear to it.\"    \"H'm!\" said the detective. \"He's not here now. Might I trouble you to  walk along to Limehouse Police Station for the ambulance? I'd better  stay here.\"    I agreed at once, and started off.    Thus a second time my plans were interrupted, for my expedition that  night ultimately led me to Bow Street, whence, after certain formalities  had been observed, I departed for my chambers, the mysterious pigtail  in my pocket. Failing the presence of Durham, the pigtail must have been  retained as evidence, but:    \"We shall know where to find it if it's wanted, Mr. Knox,\" said the Yard  man, \"and I can trust you to look after your own property.\"    The clock of St. Paul's was chiming the hour of two when I locked the  door of my chambers and prepared to turn in. The clangour of the final  strokes yet vibrated through the night's silence when someone set my own  door bell loudly ringing.    With an exclamation of annoyance I shot back the bolts and threw open  the door.    A Chinaman stood outside upon the mat!          IV    HOW IT ALL ENDED        \"Me wishee see you,\" said the apparition, smiling blandly; \"me comee  in?\"    \"Come in, by all means,\" I said without enthusiasm, and, switching on  the light in my study, I admitted the Chinaman and stood facing him  with an expression upon my face which I doubt not was the reverse of  agreeable.    My visitor, who wore a slop-shop suit, also wore a wide-brimmed bowler  hat; now, the set bland smile still upon his yellow face, he removed the  bowler and pointed significantly to his skull.    His pigtail had been severed some three inches from the root!    \"You gotchee my pigtail,\" he explained; \"me callee get it--thank you.\"    \"Thank you,\" I said grimly. \"But I must ask you to establish your claim  rather more firmly.\"    \"Yessir,\" agreed the Chinaman.    And thereupon in tolerable pidgin English he unfolded his tale. He  proclaimed his name to be Hi Wing Ho, and his profession that of a  sailor, or so I understood him. While ashore at Suez he had become  embroiled with some drunken seamen: knives had been drawn, and in the  scuffle by some strange accident his pigtail had been severed. He  had escaped from the conflict, badly frightened, and had run a great  distance before he realized his loss. Since Southern Chinamen of his  particular Tong hold their pigtails in the highest regard, he had  instituted inquiries as soon as possible, and had presently learned from  a Chinese member of the crew of the S.S. Jupiter that the precious queue  had fallen into the hands of a fireman on that vessel. He (Hi Wing Ho)  had shipped on the first available steamer bound for England, having in  the meanwhile communicated with his friend on the Jupiter respecting the  recovery of the pigtail.    \"What was the name of your friend on the Jupiter?\"    \"Him Li Ping--yessir!\"--without the least hesitation or hurry.    I nodded. \"Go on,\" I said.    He arrived at the London docks very shortly after the Jupiter. Indeed,  the crew of the latter vessel had not yet been paid off when Hi Wing  Ho presented himself at the dock gates. He admitted that, finding the  fireman so obdurate, he and his friend Li Ping had resorted to violence,  but he did not seem to recognize me as the person who had frustrated  their designs. Thus far I found his story credible enough, excepting  the accidental severing of the pigtail at Suez, but now it became  wildly improbable, for he would have me believe that Li Ping, or Ah Fu,  obtaining possession of the pigtail (in what manner Hi Wing Ho protested  that he knew not) he sought to hold it to ransom, knowing how highly Hi  Wing Ho valued it.    I glared sternly at the Chinaman, but his impassive countenance served  him well. That he was lying to me I no longer doubted; for Ah Fu could  not have hoped to secure such a price as would justify his committing  murder; furthermore, the presence of the unfortunate Jewess in the case  was not accounted for by the ingenious narrative of Hi Wing Ho. I was  standing staring at him and wondering what course to adopt, when yet  again my restless door-bell clamoured in the silence.    Hi Wing Ho started nervously, exhibiting the first symptoms of alarm  which I had perceived in him. My mind was made up in an instant. I took  my revolver from the drawer and covered him.    \"Be good enough to open the door, Hi Wing Ho,\" I said coldly.    He shrank from me, pouring forth voluble protestations.    \"Open the door!\"    I clenched my left fist and advanced upon him. He scuttled away with his  odd Chinese gait and threw open the door. Standing before me I saw my  friend Detective Sergeant Durham, and with him a remarkably tall and  very large-boned man whose square-jawed face was deeply tanned and whose  aspect was dourly Scottish.    When the piercing eyes of this stranger rested upon Hi Wing Ho an  expression which I shall never forget entered into them; an expression  coldly murderous. As for the Chinaman, he literally crumpled up.    \"You rat!\" roared the stranger.    Taking one long stride he stooped upon the Chinaman, seized him by the  back of the neck as a terrier might seize a rat, and lifted him to his  feet.    \"The mystery of the pigtail, Mr. Knox,\" said the detective, \"is solved  at last.\"    \"Have ye got it?\" demanded the Scotsman, turning to me, but without  releasing his hold upon the neck of Hi Wing Ho.    I took the pigtail from my pocket and dangled it before his eyes.    \"Suppose you come into my study,\" I said, \"and explain matters.\"    We entered the room which had been the scene of so many singular  happenings. The detective and I seated ourselves, but the Scotsman,  holding the Chinaman by the neck as though he had been some inanimate  bundle, stood just within the doorway, one of the most gigantic  specimens of manhood I had ever set eyes upon.    \"You do the talking, sir,\" he directed the detective; \"ye have all the  facts.\"    While Durham talked, then, we all listened--excepting the Chinaman, who  was past taking an intelligent interest in anything, and who, to judge  from his starting eyes, was being slowly strangled.    \"The gentleman,\" said Durham--\"Mr. Nicholson--arrived two days ago from  the East. He is a buyer for a big firm of diamond merchants, and some  weeks ago a valuable diamond was stolen from him------\"    \"By this!\" interrupted the Scotsman, shaking the wretched Hi Wing Ho  terrier fashion.    \"By Hi Wing Ho,\" explained the detective, \"whom you see before you. The  theft was a very ingenious one, and the man succeeded in getting away  with his haul. He tried to dispose of the diamond to a certain Isaac  Cohenberg, a Singapore moneylender; but Isaac Cohenberg was the bigger  crook of the two. Hi Wing Ho only escaped from the establishment of  Cohenberg by dint of sandbagging the moneylender, and quitted the town  by a boat which left the same night. On the voyage he was indiscreet  enough to take the diamond from its hiding-place and surreptitiously to  examine it. Another member of the Chinese crew, one Li Ping--otherwise  Ah Fu, the accredited agent of old Huang Chow!--was secretly watching  our friend, and, knowing that he possessed this valuable jewel, he also  learned where he kept it hidden. At Suez Ah Fu attacked Hi Wing Ho and  secured possession of the diamond. It was to secure possession of the  diamond that Ah Fu had gone out East. I don't doubt it. He employed Hi  Wing Ho--and Hi Wing Ho tried to double on him!    \"We are indebted to you, Mr. Knox, for some of the data upon which  we have reconstructed the foregoing and also for the next link in the  narrative. A fireman ashore from the Jupiter intruded upon the scene at  Suez and deprived Ah Fu of the fruits of his labours. Hi Wing Ho seems  to have been badly damaged in the scuffle, but Ah Fu, the more wily of  the two, evidently followed the fireman, and, deserting from his own  ship, signed on with the Jupiter.\"    While this story was enlightening in some respects, it was mystifying in  others. I did not interrupt, however, for Durham immediately resumed:    \"The drama was complicated by the presence of a fourth character--the  daughter of Cohenberg. Realizing that a small fortune had slipped  through his fingers, the old moneylender dispatched his daughter in  pursuit of Hi Wing Ho, having learned upon which vessel the latter had  sailed. He had no difficulty in obtaining this information, for he is in  touch with all the crooks of the town. Had he known that the diamond had  been stolen by an agent of Huang Chow, he would no doubt have hesitated.  Huang Chow has an international reputation.    \"However, his daughter--a girl of great personal beauty--relied upon her  diplomatic gifts to regain possession of the stone, but, poor creature,  she had not counted with Ah Fu, who was evidently watching your chambers  (while Hi Wing Ho, it seems, was assiduously shadowing Ah Fu!).
