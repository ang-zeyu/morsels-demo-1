But the two  parties did not see one another that night, for one camped on one side  of the hill while the other camped on the opposite side.  But the next  morning, the Frogman thought he would climb the hill and see what was  on top of it, and at the same time Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, also  decided to climb the hill to find if the wicker castle was visible from  its top.  So she stuck her head over an edge just as the Frogman's head  appeared over another edge, and both, being surprised, kept still while  they took a good look at one another.    Scraps recovered from her astonishment first, and bounding upward, she  turned a somersault and landed sitting down and facing the big Frogman,  who slowly advanced and sat opposite her.  \"Well met, Stranger!\" cried  the Patchwork Girl with a whoop of laughter.  \"You are quite the  funniest individual I have seen in all my travels.\"    \"Do you suppose I can be any funnier than you?\" asked the Frogman,  gazing at her in wonder.    \"I'm not funny to myself, you know,\" returned Scraps.  \"I wish I were.  And perhaps you are so used to your own absurd shape that you do not  laugh whenever you see your reflection in a pool or in a mirror.\"    \"No,\" said the Frogman gravely, \"I do not.  I used to be proud of my  great size and vain of my culture and education, but since I bathed in  the Truth Pond, I sometimes think it is not right that I should be  different from all other frogs.\"    \"Right or wrong,\" said the Patchwork Girl, \"to be different is to be  distinguished.  Now in my case, I'm just like all other Patchwork Girls  because I'm the only one there is.  But tell me, where did you come  from?\"    \"The Yip Country,\" said he.    \"Is that in the Land of Oz?\"    \"Of course,\" replied the Frogman.    \"And do you know that your Ruler, Ozma of Oz, has been stolen?\"    \"I was not aware that I had a Ruler, so of course I couldn't know that  she was stolen.\"    \"Well, you have. All the people of Oz,\" explained Scraps, \"are ruled by  Ozma, whether they know it or not.  And she has been stolen. Aren't you  angry?  Aren't you indignant?  Your Ruler, whom you didn't know you  had, has positively been stolen!\"    \"That is queer,\" remarked the Frogman thoughtfully. \"Stealing is a  thing practically unknown in Oz, yet this Ozma has been taken, and a  friend of mine has also had her dishpan stolen. With her I have  traveled all the way from the Yip Country in order to recover it.\"    \"I don't see any connection between a Royal Ruler of Oz and a dishpan!\"  declared Scraps.    \"They've both been stolen, haven't they?\"    \"True.  But why can't your friend wash her dishes in another dishpan?\"  asked Scraps.    \"Why can't you use another Royal Ruler?  I suppose you prefer the one  who is lost, and my friend wants her own dishpan, which is made of gold  and studded with diamonds and has magic powers.\"    \"Magic, eh?\" exclaimed Scraps. \"THERE is a link that connects the two  steals, anyhow, for it seems that all the magic in the Land of Oz was  stolen at the same time, whether it was in the Emerald City of in  Glinda's castle or in the Yip Country.  Seems mighty strange and  mysterious, doesn't it?\"    \"It used to seem that way to me,\" admitted the Frogman, \"but we have  now discovered who took our dishpan.  It was Ugu the Shoemaker.\"    \"Ugu?  Good gracious!  That's the same magician we think has stolen  Ozma.  We are now on our way to the castle of this Shoemaker.\"    \"So are we,\" said the Frogman.    \"Then follow me, quick!  And let me introduce you to Dorothy and the  other girls and to the Wizard of Oz and all the rest of us.\"    She sprang up and seized his coatsleeve, dragging him off the hilltop  and down the other side from that whence he had come.  And at the foot  of the hill, the Frogman was astonished to find the three girls and the  Wizard and Button-Bright, who were surrounded by a wooden Sawhorse, a  lean Mule, a square Woozy, and a Cowardly Lion.  A little black dog ran  up and smelled at the Frogman, but couldn't growl at him.    \"I've discovered another party that has been robbed,\" shouted Scraps as  she joined them.  \"This is their leader, and they're all going to Ugu's  castle to fight the wicked Shoemaker!\"    They regarded the Frogman with much curiosity and interest, and finding  all eyes fixed upon him, the newcomer arranged his necktie and smoothed  his beautiful vest and swung his gold-headed cane like a regular dandy.  The big spectacles over his eyes quite altered his froglike countenance  and gave him a learned and impressive look.  Used as she was to seeing  strange creatures in the Land of Oz, Dorothy was amazed at discovering  the Frogman.  So were all her companions. Toto wanted to growl at him,  but couldn't, and he didn't dare bark.  The Sawhorse snorted rather  contemptuously, but the Lion whispered to the wooden steed, \"Bear with  this strange creature, my friend, and remember he is no more  extraordinary than you are.  Indeed, it is more natural for a frog to  be big than for a Sawhorse to be alive.\"    On being questioned, the Frogman told them the whole story of the loss  of Cayke's highly prized dishpan and their adventures in search of it.  When he came to tell of the Lavender Bear King and of the Little Pink  Bear who could tell anything you wanted to know, his hearers became  eager to see such interesting animals.    \"It will be best,\" said the Wizard, \"to unite our two parties and share  our fortunes together, for we are all bound on the same errand, and as  one band we may more easily defy this shoemaker magician than if  separate. Let us be allies.\"    \"I will ask my friends about that,\" replied the Frogman, and he climbed  over the hill to find Cayke and the toy bears.  The Patchwork Girl  accompanied him, and when they came upon the Cookie Cook and the  Lavender Bear and the Pink Bear, it was hard to tell which of the lot  was the most surprised.    \"Mercy me!\" cried Cayke, addressing the Patchwork Girl.  \"However did  you come alive?\"    Scraps stared at the bears.    \"Mercy me!\" she echoed, \"You are stuffed, as I am, with cotton, and you  appear to be living.  That makes me feel ashamed, for I have prided  myself on being the only live cotton-stuffed person in Oz.\"    \"Perhaps you are,\" returned the Lavender Bear, \"for I am stuffed with  extra-quality curled hair, and so is the Little Pink Bear.\"    \"You have relieved my mind of a great anxiety,\" declared the Patchwork  Girl, now speaking more cheerfully.  \"The Scarecrow is stuffed with  straw and you with hair, so I am still the Original and Only  Cotton-Stuffed!\"    \"I hope I am too polite to criticize cotton as compared with curled  hair,\" said the King, \"especially as you seem satisfied with it.\"    Then the Frogman told of his interview with the party from the Emerald  City and added that the Wizard of Oz had invited the bears and Cayke  and himself to travel in company with them to the castle of Ugu the  Shoemaker.  Cayke was much pleased, but the Bear King looked solemn. He  set the Little Pink Bear on his lap and turned the crank in its side  and asked, \"Is it safe for us to associate with those people from the  Emerald City?\"    And the Pink Bear at once replied,      \"Safe for you and safe for me;    Perhaps no others safe will be.\"      \"That 'perhaps' need not worry us,\" said the King, \"so let us join the  others and offer them our protection.\"    Even the Lavender Bear was astonished, however, when on climbing over  the hill he found on the other side the group of queer animals and the  people from the Emerald City.  The bears and Cayke were received very  cordially, although Button-Bright was cross when they wouldn't let him  play with the Little Pink Bear.  The three girls greatly admired the  toy bears, and especially the pink one, which they longed to hold.    \"You see,\" explained the Lavender King in denying them this privilege,  \"he's a very valuable bear, because his magic is a correct guide on all  occasions, and especially if one is in difficulties.  It was the Pink  Bear who told us that Ugu the Shoemaker had stolen the Cookie Cook's  dishpan.\"    \"And the King's magic is just as wonderful,\" added Cayke, \"because it  showed us the Magician himself.\"    \"What did he look like?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"He was dreadful!\"    \"He was sitting at a table and examining an immense Book which had  three golden clasps,\" remarked the King.    \"Why, that must have been Glinda's Great Book of Records!\" exclaimed  Dorothy.  \"If it is, it proves that Ugu the Shoemaker stole Ozma, and  with her all the magic in the Emerald City.\"    \"And my dishpan,\" said Cayke.    And the Wizard added, \"It also proves that he is following our  adventures in the Book of Records, and therefore knows that we are  seeking him and that we are determined to find him and reach Ozma at  all hazards.\"    \"If we can,\" added the Woozy, but everybody frowned at him.    The Wizard's statement was so true that the faces around him were very  serious until the Patchwork Girl broke into a peal of laughter.    \"Wouldn't it be a rich joke if he made prisoners of us, too?\" she said.    \"No one but a crazy Patchwork Girl would consider that a joke,\"  grumbled Button-Bright.    And then the Lavender Bear King asked, \"Would you like to see this  magical shoemaker?\"    \"Wouldn't he know it?\" Dorothy inquired.    \"No, I think not.\"    Then the King waved his metal wand and before them appeared a room in  the wicker castle of Ugu.  On the wall of the room hung Ozma's Magic  Picture, and seated before it was the Magician.  They could see the  Picture as well as he could, because it faced them, and in the Picture  was the hillside where they were now sitting, all their forms being  reproduced in miniature.  And curiously enough, within the scene of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#19)"],[1," these cupboards,\" and  he proceeded to open all the cupboard doors. But no other head was to  be found on any of the shelves.    \"Oh, well; never mind,\" said Woot the Wanderer; \"I can't imagine what  anyone wants of a cast-off head, anyhow.\"    \"I can understand the Soldier's interest,\" asserted Polychrome, dancing  around the grimy workshop until her draperies formed a cloud around her  dainty form. \"For sentimental reasons a man might like to see his old  head once more, just as one likes to revisit an old home.\"    \"And then to kiss it good-bye,\" added the Scarecrow.    \"I hope that tin thing won't try to kiss me good-bye!\" exclaimed the  Tin Woodman's former head. \"And I don't see what right you folks have  to disturb my peace and comfort, either.\"    \"You belong to me,\" the Tin Woodman declared.    \"I do not!\"    \"You and I are one.\"    \"We've been parted,\" asserted the Head. \"It would be unnatural for me  to have any interest in a man made of tin. Please close the door and  leave me alone.\"    \"I did not think that my old Head could be so disagreeable,\" said the  Emperor. \"I--I'm quite ashamed of myself; meaning you.\"    \"You ought to be glad that I've enough sense to know what my rights  are,\" retorted the Head. \"In this cupboard I am leading a simple life,  peaceful and dignified, and when a mob of people in whom I am not  interested disturb me, they are the disagreeable ones; not I.\"    With a sigh the Tin Woodman closed and latched the cupboard door and  turned away.    \"Well,\" said the Tin Soldier, \"if my old head would have treated me as  coldly and in so unfriendly a manner as your old head has treated you,  friend Chopper, I'm glad I could not find it.\"    \"Yes; I'm rather surprised at my head, myself,\" replied the Tin  Woodman, thoughtfully. \"I thought I had a more pleasant disposition  when I was made of meat.\"    But just then old Ku-Klip the Tinsmith arrived, and he seemed surprised  to find so many visitors. Ku-Klip was a stout man and a short man. He  had his sleeves rolled above his elbows, showing muscular arms, and he  wore a leathern apron that covered all the front of him, and was so  long that Woot was surprised he didn't step on it and trip whenever he  walked. And Ku-Klip had a gray beard that was almost as long as his  apron, and his head was bald on top and his ears stuck out from his  head like two fans. Over his eyes, which were bright and twinkling, he  wore big spectacles. It was easy to see that the tinsmith was a kind  hearted man, as well as a merry and agreeable one. \"Oh-ho!\" he cried in  a joyous bass voice; \"here are both my tin men come to visit me, and  they and their friends are welcome indeed. I'm very proud of you two  characters, I assure you, for you are so perfect that you are proof  that I'm a good workman. Sit down. Sit down, all of you--if you can  find anything to sit on--and tell me why you are here.\"    So they found seats and told him all of their adventures that they  thought he would like to know. Ku-Klip was glad to learn that Nick  Chopper, the Tin Woodman, was now Emperor of the Winkies and a friend  of Ozma of Oz, and the tinsmith was also interested in the Scarecrow  and Polychrome.    He turned the straw man around, examining him curiously, and patted him  on all sides, and then said:    \"You are certainly wonderful, but I think you would be more durable and  steady on your legs if you were made of tin. Would you like me to--\"    \"No, indeed!\" interrupted the Scarecrow hastily; \"I like myself better  as I am.\"    But to Polychrome the tinsmith said:    \"Nothing could improve you, my dear, for you are the most beautiful  maiden I have ever seen. It is pure happiness just to look at you.\"    \"That is praise, indeed, from so skillful a workman,\" returned the  Rainbow's Daughter, laughing and dancing in and out the room.    \"Then it must be this boy you wish me to help,\" said Ku-Klip, looking  at Woot.    \"No,\" said Woot, \"we are not here to seek your skill, but have merely  come to you for information.\"    Then, between them, they related their search for Nimmie Amee, whom the  Tin Woodman explained he had resolved to marry, yet who had promised to  become the bride of the Tin Soldier before he unfortunately became  rusted. And when the story was told, they asked Ku-Klip if he knew what  had become of Nimmie Amee.    \"Not exactly,\" replied the old man, \"but I know that she wept bitterly  when the Tin Soldier did not come to marry her, as he had promised to  do. The old Witch was so provoked at the girl's tears that she beat  Nimmie Amee with her crooked stick and then hobbled away to gather some  magic herbs, with which she intended to transform the girl into an old  hag, so that no one would again love her or care to marry her. It was  while she was away on this errand that Dorothy's house fell on the  Wicked Witch, and she turned to dust and blew away. When I heard this  good news, I sent Nimmie Amee to find the Silver Shoes which the Witch  had worn, but Dorothy had taken them with her to the Emerald City.\"    \"Yes, we know all about those Silver Shoes,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"Well,\" continued Ku-Klip, \"after that, Nimmie Amee decided to go away  from the forest and live with some people she was acquainted with who  had a house on Mount Munch. I have never seen the girl since.\"    \"Do you know the name of the people on Mount Munch, with whom she went  to live?\" asked the Tin Woodman.    \"No, Nimmie Amee did not mention her friend's name, and I did not ask  her. She took with her all that she could carry of the goods that were  in the Witch's house, and she told me I could have the rest. But when I  went there I found nothing worth taking except some magic powders that  I did not know how to use, and a bottle of Magic Glue.\"    \"What is Magic Glue?\" asked Woot.    \"It is a magic preparation with which to mend people when they cut  themselves. One time, long ago, I cut off one of my fingers by  accident, and I carried it to the Witch, who took down her bottle and  glued it on again for me. See!\" showing them his finger, \"it is as good  as ever it was. No one else that I ever heard of had this Magic Glue,  and of course when Nick Chopper cut himself to pieces with his  enchanted axe and Captain Fyter cut himself to pieces with his  enchanted sword, the Witch would not mend them, or allow me to glue  them together, because she had herself wickedly enchanted the axe and  sword. Nothing remained but for me to make them new parts out of tin;  but, as you see, tin answered the purpose very well, and I am sure  their tin bodies are a great improvement on their meat bodies.\"    \"Very true,\" said the Tin Soldier.    \"I quite agree with you,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"I happened to find my  old head in your cupboard, a while ago, and certainly it is not as  desirable a head as the tin one I now wear.\"    \"By the way,\" said the Tin Soldier, \"what ever became of my old head,  Ku-Klip?\"    \"And of the different parts of our bodies?\" added the Tin Woodman.    \"Let me think a minute,\" replied Ku-Klip. \"If I remember right, you two  boys used to bring me most of your parts, when they were cut off, and I  saved them in that barrel in the corner. You must not have brought me  all the parts, for when I made Chopfyt I had hard work finding enough  pieces to complete the job. I finally had to finish him with one arm.\"    \"Who is Chopfyt?\" inquired Woot.    \"Oh, haven't I told you about Chopfyt?\" exclaimed Ku-Klip. \"Of course  not! And he's quite a curiosity, too. You'll be interested in hearing  about Chopfyt. This is how he happened:    \"One day, after the Witch had been destroyed and Nimmie Amee had gone  to live with her friends on Mount Munch, I was looking around the shop  for something and came upon the bottle of Magic Glue which I had  brought from the old Witch's house. It occurred to me to piece together  the odds and ends of you two people, which of course were just as good  as ever, and see if I couldn't make a man out of them. If I succeeded,  I would have an assistant to help me with my work, and I thought it  would be a clever idea to put to some practical use the scraps of Nick  Chopper and Captain Fyter. There were two perfectly good heads in my  cupboard, and a lot of feet and legs and parts of bodies in the barrel,  so I set to work to see what I could do.    \"First, I pieced together a body, gluing it with the Witch's Magic  Glue, which worked perfectly. That was the hardest part of my job,  however, because the bodies didn't match up well and some parts were  missing. But by using a piece of Captain Fyter here and a piece of Nick  Chopper there, I finally got together a very decent body, with heart  and all the trimmings complete.\"    \"Whose heart did you use in making the body?\" asked the Tin Woodman  anxiously.    \"I can't tell, for the parts had no tags on them and one heart looks  much like another. After the body was completed, I glued two fine legs  and feet onto it. One leg was Nick Chopper's and one was Captain  Fyter's and, finding one leg longer than the other, I trimmed it down  to make them match. I was much disappointed to find that I had but one  arm. There was an extra leg in the barrel, but I could find only one  arm. Having glued this onto the body, I was ready for the head, and I  had some difficulty in making up my mind which head to use. Finally I  shut my eyes and reached out my hand toward the cupboard shelf, and the  first head I touched I glued upon my new man.\"    \"It was mine!\" declared the Tin Soldier, gloomily.    \"No, it was mine,\" asserted Ku-Klip, \"for I had given you another in  exchange for it--the beautiful tin head you now wear. When the glue had  dried, my man was quite an interesting fellow. I named him Chopfyt,  using a part of Nick Chopper's name and a part of Captain Fyter's name,  because he was a mixture of both your cast-off parts. Chopfyt was  interesting, as I said, but he did not prove a very agreeable"]]]
