See Rosenberger, 515 U.S.  819, 829 (1995) (\"The necessities of confining a forum to the  limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may  justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the  discussion of certain topics.\"); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46 n.7 (1983)  (\"A public forum may be created for a limited purpose such as use  by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of certain  subjects.\").      In particular, the government forcefully argues that a  public library's decision to limit the content of its digital  offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter  scrutiny than its decisions about what content to make available  to its patrons through the library's print collection.  According  to the government, just as a public library may choose to acquire  books about gardening but not golf, without having to show that  this content-based restriction on patrons' access to speech is  narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may  a public library make content-based decisions about which speech  to make available on the Internet, without having to show that  such a restriction satisfies strict scrutiny.  Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict  the content of speech in a designated public forum by restricting  the purpose of the designated public forum that it creates is not  unlimited.  Cf. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533,  547 (2001) (\"Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a  mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First  Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.\").  As  Justice Kennedy has explained:  If Government has a freer hand to draw content-based  distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding  someone from it, the First Amendment would be a dead  letter in designated public forums; every exclusion  could be recast as a limitation. . . .  The power to  limit or redefine forums for a specific legitimate  purpose does not allow the government to exclude  certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at  all.  Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 801  (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).      Although we agree with plaintiffs that the First Amendment  imposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt content-based  restrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum, precisely  what those limits are is unclear, and presents a difficult  problem in First Amendment jurisprudence.  The Supreme Court's  \"cases have not yet determined . . . that government's decision  to dedicate a public forum to one type of content or another is  necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny.  Must a  local government, for example, show a compelling state interest  if it builds a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to  classical music (but not to jazz)?  The answer is not obvious.\"  Denver, 518 U.S. at 750 (plurality opinion); see also  Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 572-73  (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\"May an opera house limit its  productions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals?  May a  municipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or is  it required to book any potential producer on a first come, first  served basis?\").  We believe, however, that certain principles emerge from the  Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this question.  In particular,  and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the  range of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether  directly, through government grants or other funding, or  indirectly, through the creation of a public forum) the more  deference the First Amendment accords the government in drawing  content-based distinctions.      At one extreme lies the government's decision to fund a  particular message that the government seeks to disseminate.  In  this context, content-based restrictions on the speech that  government chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at most  rational basis review, and even viewpoint discrimination is  permissible.  For example, \"[w]hen Congress established a  National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to  adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C. Sec. 4411(b), it was not  constitutionally required to fund a program to encourage  competing lines of political philosophy such as communism and  fascism.\"  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194 (1991); see also  Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 541 (\"[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions  can be sustained in instances in which the government is itself  the speaker, or in instances, like Rust, in which the government  used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its  own program.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Although not strictly controlling, the Supreme Court's  unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Rust and Velazquez,  are instructive for purposes of analyzing content-based  restrictions on the use of public fora.  This is because the  limitations that government places on the use of a public forum  can be conceptualized as conditions that the government attaches  to the receipt of a benefit that it offers, namely, the use of  government property.  Public forum cases thus resemble those  unconstitutional conditions cases involving First Amendment  challenges to the conditions that the state places on the receipt  of a government benefit.  See Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544 (\"As  this suit involves a subsidy, limited forum cases . . . may not  be controlling in the strict sense, yet they do provide some  instruction.\").      Even when the government does not fund the dissemination of  a particular government message, the First Amendment generally  permits government, subject to the constraints of viewpoint  neutrality, to create public institutions such as art museums and  state universities, dedicated to facilitating the dissemination  of private speech that the government believes to have particular  merit.  Thus, in NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court  upheld the use of content-based restrictions in a federal program  awarding grants to artists on the basis of, inter alia, artistic  excellence.  \"The very assumption of the NEA is that grants will  be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing  applications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable.\"  Id. at 585 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Similarly, as Justice Stevens explained in his concurring  opinion in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the First  Amendment does not necessarily subject to strict scrutiny a state  university's use of content-based means of allocating scarce  resources, including limited public fora such as its meeting  facilities:  Because every university's resources are limited, an  educational institution must routinely make decisions  concerning the use of the time and space that is  available for extracurricular activities.  In my  judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for  those decisions to evaluate the content of a proposed  student activity.  I should think it obvious, for  example, that if two groups of 25 students requested  the use of a room at a particular time  one to view  Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an  amateur performance of Hamlet  the First Amendment  would not require that the room be reserved for the  group that submitted its application first.  Nor do I  see why a university should have to establish a  \"compelling state interest\" to defend its decision to  permit one group to use the facility and not the other.  Id. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).          The more broadly the government facilitates private speech,  however, the less deference the First Amendment accords to the  government's content-based restrictions on the speech that it  facilitates.  Thus, where the government creates a designated  public forum to facilitate private speech representing a diverse  range of viewpoints, the government's decision selectively to  single out particular viewpoints for exclusion is subject to  strict scrutiny.  Compare Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834 (applying  heightened First Amendment scrutiny to viewpoint-based  restrictions on the use of a limited public forum where the  government \"does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a  message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a  diversity of views from private speakers\"), with Finley, 524 U.S.  at 586 (\"In the context of arts funding, in contrast to many  other subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.\") (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted).  Similarly, although the government may create a designated  public forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if the  government opens the forum to members of the general public to  speak on that topic while selectively singling out for exclusion  particular speakers on the basis of the content of their speech,  that restriction is subject to strict scrutiny.  For instance, in  City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin  Employment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167 (1976), the Court  held that where a school board opens its meetings for public  participation, it may not, consistent with the First Amendment,  prohibit teachers other than union representatives from speaking  on the subject of pending collective-bargaining negotiations.  See id. at 175 (noting that the state \"has opened a forum for  direct citizen involvement\"); see also Ark. Educ. Television  Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 680 (1998) (distinguishing, for  purposes of determining the appropriate level of First Amendment  scrutiny, a televised debate in which a public broadcasting  station exercises editorial discretion in selecting participating  candidates from a debate that has \"an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#19)"],[1,"can remember everything that's  happened since then. Before that it is all blank and all mixed-up in  that dream I had.\"    She moved away from me, slightly. \"You can't tell me that the F.B.I.  would be interested in your dreams,\" she said sharply. \"Not in time of  war.\"    \"They are in this dream,\" I told her. \"You see I dreamed--if you want  to call it that--that a certain American ship blew up in the North  Pacific. The trouble is that the public hasn't been told that there is  such a ship, like that 'Old Nameless' in the Solomons, and that the  Navy Department doesn't know what happened to it. _I_ believe that  it did blow up. Harcourt believes my story, in the main, but from  the F.B.I. angle they have to check up on whether I'm not part of an  Axis spy-ring which could have caused the explosion. If I could only  remember where I was and what I was doing the week before I could clear  myself.\"    Her face lighted and she relaxed. \"Oh, is _that_ all?\" she exclaimed.  \"I _know_ you couldn't have done anything like that. All you've  probably been doing is to go off with one of those silly girls of yours  to some out-of-the-way place. That ought to be easy to check, even if  you registered under a false name. For the first time, you know,\" she  added, \"I'm almost _glad_ you've been chasing all those stupid blondes  of yours. It will make it easy to establish your alias.\"    \"Alibi,\" I corrected her. \"Let me fix you another drink. From now on,\"  I added, \"there are going to be no more blondes or red-heads. I like  Arthurjean Briggs--she's named Arthurjean for her father and mother.  It's one word like Marylou or Honeychile--but she's more like a friend  than a--oh--you know. You saw her. But I guess you're right. I must  have been chasing around so much my mind got tangled up in itself and  sort of blew a fuse. If I can't get my memory straightened out soon  I'll look up a psychiatrist and see if he can't fix me.\"    \"You know, Winnie--\" Germaine began and then fell silent.    \"Yes, Jimmie?\"    She turned towards me and smiled rather wistfully. \"You know, I was  going to say that you and I--perhaps--Well, it's so long since we've  been really--oh--_close_ to each other. I wondered--\"    \"You mean that perhaps we ought to patch things up between us?\"    \"Isn't that what a wife's for?\" she asked. \"I mean--I mean when things  get difficult it ought--there ought to be _one_ person to whom you  could turn.\"    I slipped my arm around her and drew her close to me on the lounge. She  lowered her face against my coat and I could feel her shaking.    \"You're crying!\" I said. \"You mustn't cry.\"    \"Oh, Winnie, I've been so alone--so--\"    I raised her face to mine and kissed her, tasting the wet, salt tears.  Her lips were warm and soft against mine. Suddenly she pressed herself  against me and responded to my kiss so fiercely that we were both  startled. We sprang apart, almost guiltily.    \"Oh!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh--you haven't kissed me like that--\"    She raised her lips again and this time we held it.           *       *       *       *       *    What with one thing and another, I didn't get back to the office until  the Market closed on Thursday afternoon. I found my two partners in  pretty good control of our operations but frankly mystified as to the  cause of the official mugging of Tompkins, Wasson & Cone. We had laid  out two and a half millions in all, despite the attempt to scare us  off. The market had continued steady.    Neither Graham nor Phil asked me any direct questions about the events  on Wednesday. They talked straight business and kept their curiosity  in check. It was close to half-past four when we finished our general  discussion of the operation, so I decided that they were entitled to  some kind of explanation in return for their loyalty.    \"See here, boys,\" I told them. \"You've both been perfectly swell about  this rat-race the S.E.C. started. Harry Willamer tried to put the  squeeze on me for half a million dollars to finance him and a bunch of  official bastards in a shady deal. When I turned him down he threatened  to tie us up with a Commission investigation. I bluffed him out of it  at the time by pretending there was an F.B.I. dictaphone record of  our talk, so he laid off the heavy heat and just started needling us  a little. Any time now he'll make the check at the F.B.I. and when  he finds there isn't any record he'll try to tie us up tighter than  a drum. All we can do is wait it out. The market's going to start  dropping any day now and we'll clean up.\"    \"Oh!\" Wasson said. \"Was that it? Willamer's a bad actor. Thanks for  telling us, Winnie. Phil and I knew that there must be something screwy  when--\"    The door flew open and Arthurjean appeared, her face white.    \"God!\" she said at last. \"He was such a swell guy. He--\"    \"Who? What's the mat--\"    \"It's Roosevelt!\" she choked. \"He's dead. It just came in on the  ticker.\"    \"No!\"    \"He died at Warm Springs.\" And she hid her face in her hands and left  the room, sobbing.    Phil Cone stood up, paper-white, crossed over and turned up the radio.    \"Flash!\" the announcer was saying. \"Warm Springs, Georgia. President  Roosevelt died this afternoon following his collapse from a severe  cerebral hemorrhage. More in a moment. Keep tuned to this station.\"    \"Well, I'll be eternally damned!\" I said. \"So he was right--\"    Cone whirled on me. \"You knew about this,\" he stated flatly \"When we  were talking yesterday morning. You had more than a hunch. You knew he  was going to die.\"    \"Be your age, Phil,\" I told him. \"How in hell _could_ I know?\"    \"Je-sus Ke-rist!\" Wasson growled. \"This will knock holy hell out of the  Market. Lucky trading's closed for the day. They can't open tomorrow.  They'll have to shut down all the exchanges. They'll have to close the  banks. God! What a mess!\"    Cone still looked dazed. \"No dancing in the streets?\" he asked  bitterly. \"I thought this was going to send values sky-rocketing.\"    Wasson swung on him. \"The hell with that talk, Phil,\" he snapped. \"I  was just shooting the bull. Roosevelt dead! Jesus H. Christ! You know,  he wasn't a bad old buzzard after he got rid of all that New Deal  nonsense and set to work winning this war.\"    Cone had recovered his poise. \"Sure he did a swell job winning the war,  but now we're going to lose the peace, sure as shooting!\"    \"Hell!\" Graham's choice of expletives was strictly rationed. \"This  means that Truman will take over. What sort of a guy is he? You got any  idea, Winnie? He's not up to Roosevelt, that's sure.\"    I shook my head. \"I don't know from nothing,\" I began. \"Sh!\"    The radio announcer resumed his broadcast. \"Warm Springs, Georgia.  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed away at four thirty-five  this afternoon, Eastern War Time, following a severe cerebral  hemorrhage. The late President had been spending a few days at his  Georgia retreat getting rested after his strenuous trip to the Yalta  Conference. Earlier this afternoon he complained of a severe headache  and almost immediately became unconscious. He died peacefully a little  later. His death came at a moment when American troops in Germany and  on Okinawa were driving ahead toward the victory he--\"    Cone switched it down again. \"_He_ had a headache!\" he muttered. \"What  do you think _we're_ going to have?\"    The telephone rang. I picked up the instrument. It was one of those  automatic phonograph recordings. \"The Stock Exchange will not be open  tomorrow by order of the Governors, out of respect for the memory of  the late President Roosevelt. That is all--The Stock Exchange will not  be open--\" the metallic feminine voice went on. I hung up.    \"You're right about one thing, Graham,\" I said. \"That was an automatic  message to say the Exchange will be closed tomorrow. It's probably on  the ticker, too.\"    It was.    Cone sat down suddenly, as though his legs had turned to rubber.    \"Now it will all start again,\" he said. \"Sell out and pack up, pack up  and clear out.\"    I crossed the office and put my hand on his shoulder. \"Cheer up, Phil,\"  I told him. \"It won't be as bad as that. Graham and I will stick with  you and that's true of Americans generally.\"    Cone shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. \"Thanks, Winnie,\" he remarked.  \"You're a good fellow and a good friend. I've got something to say  to you. You won't like it. I got worried yesterday when you started  talking about Roosevelt maybe dying and I tipped the F.B.I. on what you  said.\"    I laughed. \"If the F.B.I. arrested every man in Wall Street who had  ever talked about Roosevelt dying the jails wouldn't hold them. Don't  worry, Phil. In your shoes I'd have done the same thing.\"    The phone rang again. It was the receptionist. \"Mr. Harcourt is here to  see you, Mr. Tompkins,\" she informed me. \"Shall I ask him to wait?\"    \"Tell him I'll see him in a couple of minutes,\" I replied.    \"This is it, boys,\" I told my partners. \"It's the F.B.I. Now, the  Market's going to drop. It will be a bear market in a big way,  dignified as hell, and we're in ahead of the others. You two just carry  on. Try to get a line on this guy Truman. Some of our Kansas City  correspondents may have the dope. Phil, no hard feelings about this  F.B.I. angle. They've been riding me for days on some crazy story Ranty  Tolan started about me last week.\"    Wasson looked at me coldly. \"If I thought that you had anything to do  with this--\" he began.    \"Oh skip it!\" I begged him. \"You know me better.\"    I picked up the phone and told the receptionist to send Harcourt in.    \"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said. \"I've been ordered to ask you to come up to  the Bureau's headquarters right away.\"    \"Am I under arrest?\" I asked.    \"Well,\" Harcourt admitted, \"I haven't got a warrant but I think maybe  you better come with me.\"    \"What's the charge?\"    \"My chief will tell you what it's all about,\" he said. \"My orders were  to bring you in for"]]]
