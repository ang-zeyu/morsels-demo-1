Many of the exhibits were maintained at a high standard by being  constantly replenished with fresh fruits at great expense, particularly  the Californian citrus pyramid, comprising 31,150 oranges.    The richly decorated court planted with ornamental shrubs and flowers, led  to the center pavilion which was roofed by a huge crystal dome. This  translucent cover transmitted the light and sunshine necessary for the  floricultural display beneath. Stately palms, tall tree ferns in great  variety, and gorgeous specimens from the flora of almost every section,  formed an immense pyramid of shrubbery. The luxuriously growing vines  entwined their tendrils around the iron-work of the building, adding  greatly to the beauty of the panorama. This superb spectacle recalled to  memory Horace Smith's \"Hymn to the Flowers.\" In one of its fifteen  stanzas, the poet exclaims:       \"Not useless are ye, flowers, though made for pleasure,      Blooming over field and wave, by day and night:      From every source your sanction bids me treasure          Harmless Delight.\"    We descended a cavern, extending underneath this magnificent flower  exhibit. Our scrutinizing eyes met with quite novel features. We observed  that the grotto was lined with glistening crystals from the mammoth cave  of South Dakota. Emerging again to broad daylight, we bent our steps  southward to that portion of the building, where the silver model of the  Horticultural Hall and the miniature Capitol of the Country compelled the  admiration of the beholder.    The south pavilion encompassed the displays of viticulture.  Representations of actual scenes in the vicinity of California vine-yards--  wine cellars--cool grottos--and a highly ornamental fountain throwing  sprays of wine, constituted the most attractive domestic scenes.    A picturesque panorama of the vine-clad banks of the Rhine with its  romantically situated castles--reminiscences of feudal times--formed a  portion of the German wine cellar exhibit; also comprising an excellent  display of _Rhein- und Moselweine_.    Of the foreign wine-growing countries, the most attractive contributions  were made by Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Chili, New South  Wales, and Canada.    We abandoned the building in order to view the floricultural out-of-door  exhibits, which covered the large spaces on the lawns adjoining it and the  Wooded Island.    Glancing at the beautiful orchids, roses, carnations, sweet peas,  dianthus, asters, phlox, gladiolus, zinnias, and many other fragrant  flowers, we experienced infinitely more subtle modulations of delight than  can be easily described. The features of the horticultural displays were  so striking that their memory is immortalized:--       \"For this picture in my brain      Only fades to come again.\"    In fact, we had witnessed multifarious sublime spectacles during that  day's sojourn in the White City.    Returning to the pier where the \"Marguerite\" lay moored, we were greatly  amazed as we caught sight of Lake Michigan--to find its waters lashed into  fury by a northeast gale, of which we had felt nothing while in the  pleasantly tempered Horticultural Building.    Since it was impossible to stay where we were, on account of the exposed  situation, there was no help for it--but to put out for our usual  anchorage, inside the breakwater at Chicago. For my own part, I decided to  remain on deck. Perhaps, had I realized more fully what we had to  encounter, I should have sought my stateroom, with the rest. But I can  truly say: for three-quarters of an hour, my whole energies were employed  to keep my place.    During our entire journey from Schenectady, N.Y., to the White City, we  had not experienced anything like it. Everything of a movable character  had to be secured; and it was an intense relief to all, when after an  extraordinary upheaval--the last effort of the uncontrolled waves upon our  stanch craft--she passed into the peaceful waters behind the breakwater;  completely sheltered from the raging elements, which broke with ceaseless  roar upon the concrete mass.    The following morning as the rest of the party decided to remain in  Chicago for the purpose of viewing the renowned play \"America\" in the  Auditorium, I visited Jackson Park alone, spending many hours in the  Liberal Arts Building, which inclosed (besides multitudinous magnificent  displays illustrating the department of Liberal Arts) the object of my  special interest, viz. the educational exhibits. They comprised not only  contributions from every State in the Union but also from Germany, Great  Britain, France, Mexico, Canada, Russia, New South Wales, Spain, Belgium,  and Japan.    The general character of them was represented by models and appliances for  teaching, text-books, diagrams, examples, specimens of the school work on  the various scientific subjects, and illustrations of the methods employed  in instruction by the teachers of the different States and Nations.    By means of the ingenious arrangement of these displays, manifesting the  great achievements made in the development of pedagogy, I augmented my  professional learning during the hours of that day to such an extent as  would otherwise require months of careful study. The means of obtaining  these results of so great interest and profit to me as a teacher, were  much facilitated by my knowledge of several of the languages spoken by the  nations represented there. For, I readily understood the reports,  statistics, and text-books sent from the educational institutions of the  leading countries. Furthermore, the commissioners of the respective  sections, whom I addressed in their native tongue, complaisantly gave me  all the additional information I desired.    As I inspected, among the manifold exhibits contributed by the State of  New York, the specimen work from the best pupils of the Art Students'  League, some sketches from life and drawings from the antique attracted my  special attention. They bore the signature of a young gentleman from  Schenectady--Walter M. Clute--a name which, I am certain, will be widely  known in future years as that of a prominent artist of this country.    We spent the following day--Sunday--in Chicago which is perhaps the most  remarkable city in the world for its rapid growth. Its history dates back  to the year 1803, when Fort Dearborn was erected. Abandoned at the  beginning of the war with Great Britain in 1812, it was destroyed by the  Indians; but rebuilt in 1816. The town was organized in 1833, and the  first charter of a city passed by the Legislature, March 4, 1837. A number  of outlying suburbs of Chicago were annexed by popular vote so that the  present area of the city covers 181 square miles; its population being  about 1,400,000. When we consider the fact that in 1871 a great fire,  sweeping over the business center of Chicago, laid more than 2,000 acres  in ruins, and then reflect on the city of to-day, rebuilt in a style of  great solidity and magnificence, with its innumerable handsome buildings  of stupendous proportions--its six hundred beautiful churches--and its  vast number of educational institutions, we cannot but admire the spirit  of enterprise which evolved such wondrous prosperity in little more than  two decades.    The destructive fire constituted the largest conflagration of modern  times. Commencing by the overturning of a lamp in a district built up  almost exclusively of wood, about nine o'clock in the evening of October  8, 1871, it continued through that night and the greater part of the next  day. Finally, it was checked by the explosion of gunpowder, whereupon it  exhausted itself by burning all there was to ignite within the confined  space. Although 18,000 houses had been reduced to ashes, ten years  thereafter all traces of the calamity had disappeared.    It would be impossible to give a description of all the fine buildings  which have made Chicago famous. The principal hotel--probably the largest  in the world--is the \"Auditorium,\" having its dining halls on the tenth  floor. All the conveniences that modern ingenuity has excogitated--in  accordance with the requirements of the present era--have been introduced  into this huge structure. It includes a theater having a seating capacity  for 6,000 spectators.    The park system of Chicago is one of the most extensive in the world.  Jackson and Washington Parks belong to the south division, whereas the  western section inside the city limits comprises three; known as Humboldt,  Garfield, and Douglas Parks. Their ornamentation is varied by superb  flower-beds, fountains, statues, and monuments. Lincoln Park--including a  zoological garden, and being romantically situated upon the lake shore in  the northern portion of the city--constitutes a delightful place of  amusement for pleasure-seekers. The parks are all connected by  boulevards--some of them 200 feet wide--encircling the city, and affording  a continuous drive of thirty-five miles.    The trade of Chicago is enormous. Its chief items are grain, live-stock,  meat products, and lumber. It principally manufactures iron and steel,  wood, brick, leather, chemicals, boots and shoes, cigars and tobacco.    The next day after our return to the Chicago Harbor in the evening, Mrs.  Dr. McDonald of Chicago accompanied by her brother, Mr. Bernard, paid us a  visit on board the \"Marguerite.\" Miss Campbell made the acquaintance of  this amiable lady during her last trip to Europe; and they were  traveling-companions, spending many pleasant days journeying together  in the old world.    The WOMAN'S BUILDING was the first structure to be inspected after our  next arrival on the Exposition Grounds, according to the programme for  that day. It represented a great museum filled with countless  contributions made by women. The superb displays of paintings, ceramics,  art work, manufactures, liberal arts, embroideries, fancy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#19)"],[1,"throughout the whole  land?  Shall we not journey cover the whole sea in like manner?\"  And  Thoth said, \"This water shall be called the 'Sea of journeying,' from  this day onward.\"    And they sailed about over the water during the night, and they did not  see any of those enemies at all.    Then they made a journey forth and arrived in the country of Ta-  sti,[FN#107] at the town of Shas-hertet, and he perceived the most able  of their enemies in the country of Uaua,[FN#108] and they were uttering  treason against Horus their Lord.        [FN#107]  Northern Nubia; the name means \"Land of the Bow.\"    [FN#108]  A portion of Northern Nubia.        And Heru-Behut changed his form into that of the Winged Disk, [and took  his place] above the bow of the Boat of Ra. And he made the goddess  Nekhebit[FN#109] and the goddess Uatchit[FN#110] to be with him in the  form of serpents, so that they might make the Sebau fiends to quake in  [all] their limbs (or, bodies).  Their boldness (i.e., that of the  fiends) subsided through the fear of him, they made no resistance  whatsoever, and they died straightway.        [FN#109]  The goddess of the South.    [FN#110]  The goddess of the North.        Then the gods who were in the following of the Boat of Heru-khuti said,  \"Great, great is that which he hath done among them by means of the two  Serpent Goddesses,[FN#111] for he hath overthrown the enemy by means of  their fear of him.\"        [FN#111]  i.e., Nekhebit and Uatchit.        And Ra Heru-khuti said, \"The great one of the two Serpent Goddesses of  Heru-Behutet shall be called 'Ur-Uatchti'[FN#112] from this day  onwards.\"        [FN#112]  \"Great one of the Two Uraei-goddesses;\" these goddesses had  their places above the brow of the god, or at the right and left of the  solar disk.        XIX.  And Heru-khuti travelled on in his boat, and landed at the city  of Thes-Heru (Apollinopolis Magna).  And Thoth said, \"The being of  light who hath come forth from the horizon hath smitten the enemy in  the form which he hath made, and he shall be called Being of light who  hath come forth from the horizon from this day onwards.\"[FN#113]        [FN#113]  In the sculpture (Naville, Mythe, pl. 19) we see the god, who  is hawk-headed, and wears the crowns of the South and North, seated in  a shrine set upon a pedestal.  In the right hand he holds the sceptre  and in the left the ankh.        And Ra Heru-khuti (Ra Harmachis) said to Thoth, \"Thou shalt make this  Winged Disk to be in every place wherein I seat myself (or, dwell), and  in [all] the seats of the gods in the South, and in [all] the seats of  the gods in the Land of the North . . . . . . . in the Country of  Horus, that it may drive away the evil ones from their domains.\"    Then Thoth made the image of the Winged Disk to be in every sanctuary  and in every temple, where they now are, wherein are all the gods and  all the goddesses from this day onwards.  Now through the Winged Disk  which is on the temple-buildings of all the gods and all the goddesses  of the Land of the Lily,[FN#114] and the Land of the Papyrus,[FN#115]  [these buildings] become shrines of Heru-Behutet.        [FN#114]  i.e., the North, especially the Delta.    [FN#115]  i.e., the South.        As concerning Heru-Behutet, the great god, the lord of heaven, the  president of the Ater of the South,[FN#116] he it is who is made to be  on the right hand.  This is Heru-Behutet on whom the goddess Nekhebit  is placed in the form of a serpent (or, uraeus).  As concerning Heru-  Behutet, the great god, the lord of heaven, the lord of Mesent, the  president of the Ater of the North,[FN#117] he it is who is made to be  on the left hand.  This Heru-Behutet on whom the goddess Uatchit is  placed is in the form of a serpent.        [FN#116]  i.e., the southern half of heaven.    [FN#117]  i.e., the northern half of heaven.        As concerning Heru-Behutet, the great god, the lord of heaven, the lord  of Mesent, the president of the two Aterti of the South and North, Ra  Heru-khuti set it (i.e., the Winged Disk) in his every place, to  overthrow the enemies in every place wherein they are.  And he shall be  called President of the two Aterti of the South and North because of  this from this day onwards.[FN#118]        [FN#118]  In the sculpture which illustrates this portion of the text  at Edfu, two Winged Disks are represented.  The first has #### on each  side of it.  The disk has an uraeus on each side.  The second winged  symbol of the god consists of a beetle with outstretched wings, which  holds between his forelegs the solar disk, and between his hind legs  the symbol of the orbit of the sun.            A HYMN TO OSIRIS AND A LEGEND OF THE ORIGIN OF HORUS.        Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King of the gods, whose names  are manifold, whose transformations are sublime, whose form is hidden  in the temples whose Ka is holy, the Governor of Tetut,[FN#119] the  mighty one of possessions (?)in the shrine,[FN#120] the Lord of  praises[FN#121] in the nome of Anetch,[FN#122] President of the tchefa  food in Anu,[FN#123] Lord who art commemorated in [the town of]  Maati,[FN#124] the mysterious (or, hidden) Soul, the Lord of  Qerret,[FN#125] the sublime one in White Wall,[FN#126] the Soul of Ra  [and] his very body, who hast thy dwelling in Henensu,[FN#127] the  beneficent one, who art praised in Nart,[FN#128] who makest to rise up  thy Soul, Lord of the Great House in the city[FN#129] of the Eight  Gods,[FN#130] [who inspirest] great terror in Shas-hetep,[FN#131] Lord  of eternity, Governor of Abtu (Abydos).        [FN#119]  More fully Pa-Asar-neb-Tetut, the Busiris of the Greeks;  Busiris = Pa-Asar, \"House of Osiris,\" par excellence.  The variant  Tataut also occurs.    [FN#120]  An allusion, perhaps, to the town Sekhem, the capital of the  second nome (Letopolites) of Lower Egypt.    [FN#121]  i.e., lord whose praises are sung.    [FN#122]  Letopolites.    [FN#123]  Heliopolis.    [FN#124]  i.e., a famous sanctuary in the Letopolite nome where Ptah  was worshipped.    [FN#125]  The region of the First Cataract, where the Nile was believed  to rise.    [FN#126]  Memphis.    [FN#127]  Herakleopolis, the {hbw XaNeS} of Isaiah.    [FN#128]  A name of Herakleopolis.    [FN#129]  Khemenu or Hermopolis, the city of Thoth.    [FN#130]  These gods were: Nu and Nut; Hehu and Hehut; Kekui and  Kekuit; Kerh and Kerhet.    [FN#131]  The capital of Set, the eleventh nome of Upper Egypt; the  chief local deity was Khnemu.        Thy seat (or, domain) reacheth far into Ta-tchesert,[FN#132] and thy  name is firmly stablished in the mouth[s] of men.  Thou art the two-  fold substance of the Two Lands[FN#133] everywhere (?), and the divine  food (tchef) of the Kau,[FN#134] the Governor of the Companies[FN#135]  of the Gods, and the beneficent (or, perfect) Spirit-soul[FN#136] among  Spirit-souls.  The god Nu draweth his waters from thee,[FN#137] and  thou bringest forth the north wind at eventide, and wind from thy  nostrils to the satisfaction of thy heart.  Thy heart flourisheth, and  thou bringest forth the splendour of tchef food.        [FN#132]  A name of the Other World.    [FN#133]  i.e., the two Egypts, Upper and Lower.    [FN#134]  The Doubles of the beatified who are fed by Osiris in the  Other World.    [FN#135]  Three Companies are distinguished: the gods of Heaven, the  gods of Earth, and the gods of the Other World.    [FN#136]  The indestructible, immortal Spirit-soul as opposed to the  Ba-soul or animal-soul.      [FN#137]  Here and in other places I have changed the pronoun of the  third person into that of the second to avoid the abrupt changes of the  original.        The height of heaven and the stars [thereof] are obedient unto thee,  and thou makest to be opened the great gates [of the sky].  Thou art  the lord to whom praises are sung in the southern heaven, thou art he  to whom thanks are given in the northern heaven.  The stars which never  diminish are under the place of thy face,[FN#138] and thy seats are the  stars which never rest.[FN#139]  Offerings appear before thee by the  command of Keb.  The Companies of the Gods ascribe praise unto thee,  the Star-gods of the Tuat smell the earth before thee,[FN#140] the  domains [make] bowings [before thee], and the ends of the earth make  supplication to thee [when] they see thee.        [FN#138]  i.e., they are under thy inspection and care.    [FN#139]  i.e., the stars which never set.  The allusion is probably to  certain circumpolar stars.    [FN#140]  i.e., do homage.        Those who are among the holy ones are in terror of him, and the Two  Lands, all of them, make acclamations to him when they meet His  Majesty.  Thou art a shining Noble at the head of the nobles, permanent  in [thy] high rank, stablished in [thy] sovereignty, the beneficent  Power of the Company of the Gods.  Well-pleasing [is thy] face, and  thou art beloved by him that seeth thee.  Thou settest the fear of thee  in all lands, and because of their love for thee [men] hold thy name to  be pre-eminent.  Every man maketh offerings unto thee, and thou art the  Lord who is commemorated in heaven and upon earth.  Manifold are the  cries of acclamation to thee in the Uak[FN#141] festival, and the Two  Lands shout joyously to thee with one accord.  Thou art the eldest, the  first of thy brethren, the Prince of the Company of the Gods, and the  stablisher of Truth throughout the Two Lands.  Thou settest [thy] son  upon the great throne of his father Keb.  Thou art the beloved one of  thy mother Nut, whose valour is most mighty [when] thou overthrowest  the Seba Fiend.  Thou hast slaughtered thy enemy, and hast put the fear  of thee into thy Adversary.        [FN#141]  One of the chief festivals of Osiris, during which the god  made a periplus.        Thou art the bringer in of the remotest boundaries, and art stable of  heart, and thy two feet are lifted up (?); thou "]]]
