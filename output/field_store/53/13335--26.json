[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#19)"],[1,"for over two hundred years.    This is how it happened.    About 250 years ago a poor Brahman couple were promised, in sleep, by  the god of wisdom that he would incarnate in their eldest son. The boy  was named Maroba (one of the god's titles) in honor of the deity. Maroba  grew up, married, and begot several sons, after which he was commanded  by the god to relinquish the world and finish his days in the desert.  There, during twenty-two years, according to the legend, Maroba wrought  miracles and his fame grew day by day. He lived in an impenetrable  jungle, in a corner of the thick forest that covered Chinchood in those  days. Gunpati appeared to him once more, and promised to incarnate in  his descendants for seven generations. After this there was no limit  to his miracles, so that the people began to worship him, and ended by  building a splendid temple for him.    At last Maroba gave orders to the people to bury him alive, in a sitting  posture, with an open book in his hands, and never to open his grave  again under penalty of his wrath and maledictions. After the burial  of Maroba, Gunpati incarnated in his first-born, who began a conjuring  career in his turn. So that Maroba-Deo I, was replaced by Chintaman-Deo  I. This latter god had eight wives and eight sons. The tricks of the  eldest of these sons, Narayan-Deo I, became so celebrated that his fame  reached the ears of the Emperor Alamgir. In order to test the extent of  his \"deification,\" Alamgir sent him a piece of a cow's tail wrapped in  rich stuffs and coverings. Now, to touch the tail of a dead cow is the  worst of all degradations for a Hindu. On receiving it Narayan sprinkled  the parcel with water, and, when the stuffs were unfolded, there was  found enclosed in them a nosegay of white syringa, instead of the  ungodly tail. This transformation rejoiced the Emperor so much that he  presented the god with eight villages, to cover his private expenses.  Narayan's social position and property were inherited by Chintaman-Deo  II., whose heir was Dharmadhar, and, lastly, Narayan II came into  power. He drew down the malediction of Gunpati by violating the grave  of Maroba. That is why his son, the last of the gods, is to die without  issue.    When we saw him he was an aged man, about ninety years old. He was  seated on a kind of platform. His head shook and his eyes idiotically  stared without seeing us, the result of his constant use of opium. On  his neck, ears, and toes, shone precious stones, and all around were  spread offerings. We had to take off our shoes before we were allowed to  approach this half-ruined relic.----      On the evening of the same day we returned to Bombay. Two days later we  were to start on our long journey to the North-West Provinces, and our  route promised to be very attractive. We were to see Nassik, one of the  few towns mentioned by Greek historians, its caves, and the tower of  Rama; to visit Allahabad, the ancient Prayaga, the metropolis of the  moon dynasty, built at the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna; Benares,  the town of five thousand temples and as many monkeys; Cawnpur,  notorious for the bloody revenge of Nana Sahib; the remains of the city  of the sun, destroyed, according to the computations of Colebrooke, six  thousand years ago; Agra and Delhi; and then, having explored Rajistan  with its thousand Takur castles, fortresses, ruins, and legends, we were  to go to Lahore, the metropolis of the Punjab, and, lastly, to stay for  a while in Amritsar. There, in the Golden Temple, built in the centre  of the \"Lake of Immortality,\" was to be held the first meeting of the  members of our Society, Brahmans, Buddhists, Sikhs, etc.--in a word,  the representatives of the one thousand and one sects of India, who all  sympathized, more or less, with the idea of the Brotherhood of Humanity  of our Theosophical Society.          Vanished Glories      Benares, Prayaga (now Allahabad), Nassik, Hurdwar, Bhadrinath,  Matura--these were the sacred places of prehistoric India which we were  to visit one after the other; but to visit them, not after the usual  manner of tourists, a vol d'oiseau, with a cheap guide-book in our hands  and a cicerone to weary our brains, and wear out our legs. We were well  aware that all these ancient places are thronged with traditions and  overgrown with the weeds of popular fancy, like ruins of ancient castles  covered with ivy; that the original shape of the building is destroyed  by the cold embrace of these parasitic plants, and that it is as  difficult for the archaeologist to form an idea of the architecture  of the once perfect edifice, judging only by the heaps of disfigured  rubbish that cover the country, as for us to select from out the thick  mass of legends good wheat from weeds. No guides and no cicerone could  be of any use whatever to us. The only thing they could do would be to  point out to us places where once there stood a fortress, a castle, a  temple, a sacred grove, or a celebrated town, and then to repeat legends  which came into existence only lately, under the Mussulman rule. As to  the undisguised truth, the original history of every interesting spot,  we should have had to search for these by ourselves, assisted only by  our own conjectures.    Modern India does not present a pale shadow of what it was in the  pre-Christian era, nor even of the Hindostan of the days of Akbar,  Shah-Jehan and Aurungzeb. The neighborhood of every town that has been  shattered by many a war, and of every ruined hamlet, is covered with  round reddish pebbles, as if with so many petrified tears of blood. But,  in order to approach the iron gate of some ancient fortress, it is not  over natural pebbles that it is necessary to walk, but over the broken  fragments of some older granite remains, under which, very often, rest  the ruins of a third town, still more ancient than the last. Modern  names have been given to them by Mussulmans, who generally built their  towns upon the remains of those they had just taken by assault. The  names of the latter are sometimes mentioned in the legends, but the  names of their predecessors had completely disappeared from the popular  memory even before the Mussulman invasion. Will a time ever come  for these secrets of the centuries to be revealed? Knowing all this  beforehand, we resolved not to lose patience, even though we had to  devote whole years to explorations of the same places, in order to  obtain better historical information, and facts less disfigured than  those obtained by our predecessors, who had to be contented with a  choice collection of naive lies, poured forth from the mouth of some  frightened semi-savage, or some Brahman, unwilling to speak and desirous  of disguising the truth. As for ourselves, we were differently situated.  We were helped by a whole society of educated Hindus, who were as deeply  interested in the same questions as ourselves. Besides, we had a promise  of the revelation of some secrets, and the accurate translation of some  ancient chronicles, that had been preserved as if by a miracle.    The history of India has long since faded from the memories of her sons,  and is still a mystery to her conquerors. Doubtless it still exists,  though, perchance, only partly, in manuscripts that are jealously  concealed from every European eye. This has been shown by some  pregnant words, spoken by Brahmans on their rare occasions of friendly  expansiveness. Thus, Colonel Tod, whom I have already quoted several  times, is said to have been told by a Mahant, the chief of an ancient  pagoda-monastery: \"Sahib, you lose your time in vain researches. The  Bellati India [India of foreigners] is before you, but you will  never see the Gupta India [secret India]. We are the guardians of her  mysteries, and would rather cut out each other's tongues than speak.\"    Yet, nevertheless, Tod succeeded in learning a good deal. It must be  borne in mind that no Englishman has ever been loved so well by the  natives as this old and courageous friend of the Maharana of Oodeypur,  who, in his turn, was so friendly towards the natives that the humblest  of them never saw a trace of contempt in his demeanour. He wrote before  ethnology had reached its present stage of development, but his book  is still an authority on everything concerning Rajistan. Though the  author's opinion of his work was not very high, though he stated that  \"it is nothing but a conscientious collection of materials for a future  historian,\" still in this book is to be found many a thing undreamed of  by any British civil servant.    \"Let our friends smile incredulously. Let our enemies laugh at our  pretensions to penetrate the world-mysteries of Aryavarta,\" as a certain  critic recently expressed himself. However pessimistic may be our  critics' views, yet, even in the event of our conclusions not proving  more trustworthy than those of Fergusson, Wilson, Wheeler, and the rest  of the archeologists and Sanskritists who have written about India,  still, I hope, they will not be less susceptible of proof. We are daily  reminded that, like unreasonable children, we have undertaken a task  before which archaeologists and historians, aided by all the influence  and wealth of the Government, have shrunk dismayed; that we have taken  upon ourselves a work which has proved to be beyond the capacities of  the Royal Asiatic Society.    Let it be so.    Let everyone try to remember, as we ourselves remember, that not very  long ago a poor Hungarian, who not only had no means of any kind but was  almost a beggar, traveled on foot to Tibet through unknown and dangerous  countries, led only by the love of learning and the eager wish to  pour light on the historical origin of his nation. The result was that  inexhaustible mines of literary treasures were discovered. Philology,  which till then had wandered in the Egyptian darkness of etymological  labyrinths, and was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#19)"],[1,"so.    \"Our children are just coming to the age when everything depends on my  efforts. They are delicate in health, and nervous and excitable, and  need a mother's whole attention. Can I lawfully divide my attention by  literary efforts?    \"There is one thing I must suggest. If I am to write, I must have a  room to myself, which shall be _my_ room. I have in my own mind pitched  on Mrs. Whipple's room. I can put the stove in it. I have bought a  cheap carpet for it, and I have furniture enough at home to furnish it  comfortably, and I only beg in addition that you will let me change the  glass door from the nursery into that room and keep my plants there,  and then I shall be quite happy.    \"All last winter I felt the need of some place where I could go and be  quiet and satisfied. I could not there, for there was all the setting  of tables, and clearing up of tables, and dressing and washing of  children, and everything else going on, and the constant falling of  soot and coal dust on everything in the room was a constant annoyance  to me, and I never felt comfortable there though I tried hard. Then if  I came into the parlor where you were I felt as if I were interrupting  you, and you know you sometimes thought so too.    \"Now this winter let the cooking-stove be put into that room, and let  the pipe run up through the floor into the room above. We can eat by  our cooking-stove, and the children can be washed and dressed and keep  their playthings in the room above, and play there when we don't want  them below. You can study by the parlor fire, and I and my plants,  etc., will take the other room. I shall keep my work and all my things  there and feel settled and quiet. I intend to have a regular part of  each day devoted to the children, and then I shall take them in there.\"    In his reply to this letter Professor Stowe says:--    \"The little magazine ('The Souvenir') goes ahead finely. Fisher sent  down to Fulton the other day and got sixty subscribers. He will make  the June number as handsome as possible, as a specimen number for the  students, several of whom will take agencies for it during the coming  vacation. You have it in your power by means of this little magazine  to form the mind of the West for the coming generation. It is just as  I told you in my last letter. God has written it in his book that you  must be a literary woman, and who are we that we should contend against  God? You must therefore make all your calculations to spend the rest of  your life with your pen.    \"If you only could come home to-day how happy should I be. I am daily  finding out more and more (what I knew very well before) that you are  the most intelligent and agreeable woman in the whole circle of my  acquaintance.\"    That Professor Stowe's devoted admiration for his wife was  reciprocated, and that a most perfect sympathy of feeling existed  between the husband and wife, is shown by a line in one of Mrs.  Stowe's letters from Hartford in which she says: \"I was telling  Belle yesterday that I did not know till I came away how much I was  dependent upon you for information. There are a thousand favorite  subjects on which I could talk with you better than with any one else.  If you were not already my dearly loved husband I should certainly fall  in love with you.\"    In this same letter she writes of herself:--    \"One thing more in regard to myself. The absence and wandering of mind  and forgetfulness that so often vexes you is a physical infirmity  with me. It is the failing of a mind not calculated to endure a great  pressure of care, and so much do I feel the pressure I am under,  so much is my mind often darkened and troubled by care, that life  seriously considered holds out few allurements,--only my children.    \"In returning to my family, from whom I have been so long separated,  I am impressed with a new and solemn feeling of responsibility. It  appears to me that I am not probably destined for long life; at all  events, the feeling is strongly impressed upon my mind that a work is  put into my hands which I must be earnest to finish shortly. It is  nothing great or brilliant in the world's eye; it lies in one small  family circle, of which I am called to be the central point.\"    On her way home from this Eastern visit Mrs. Stowe traveled for the  first time by rail, and of this novel experience she writes to Miss  Georgiana May:--                                    BATAVIA, _August 29, 1842._        Here I am at Brother William's, and our passage along      this railroad reminds me of the verse of the psalm:--            \"Tho' lions roar and tempests blow,           And rocks and dangers fill the way.\"        Such confusion of tongues, such shouting and swearing,      such want of all sort of system and decency in      arrangements, I never desire to see again. I was      literally almost trodden down and torn to pieces in      the Rochester depot when I went to help my poor,      near-sighted spouse in sorting out the baggage. You      see there was an accident which happened to the cars      leaving Rochester that morning, which kept us two      hours and a half at the passing place this side of      Auburn, waiting for them to come up and go by us.      The consequence was that we got into this Rochester      depot aforesaid after dark, and the steamboat, the      canal-boat, and the Western train of cars had all been      kept waiting three hours beyond their usual time,      and they all broke loose upon us the moment we put      our heads out of the cars, and such a jerking, and      elbowing, and scuffling, and swearing, and protesting,      and scolding you never heard, while the great      locomotive sailed up and down in the midst thereof,      spitting fire and smoke like some great fiend monster      diverting himself with our commotions. I do think      these steam concerns border a little too much on the      supernatural to be agreeable, especially when you are      shut up in a great dark depot after sundown.        Well, after all, we had to ride till twelve o'clock at      night to get to Batavia, and I've been sick abed, so to      speak, ever since.    The winter of 1842 was one of peculiar trial to the family at Walnut  Hills; as Mrs. Stowe writes, \"It was a season of sickness and gloom.\"  Typhoid fever raged among the students of the seminary, and the house  of the president was converted into a hospital, while the members of  his family were obliged to devote themselves to nursing the sick and  dying.    July 6, 1843, a few weeks before the birth of her third daughter,  Georgiana May, a most terrible and overwhelming sorrow came on Mrs.  Stowe, in common with all the family, in the sudden death of her  brother, the Rev. George Beecher.    He was a young man of unusual talent and ability, and much loved by his  church and congregation. The circumstances of his death are related  in a letter written by Mrs. Stowe, and are as follows: \"Noticing the  birds destroying his fruit and injuring his plants, he went for a  double-barreled gun, which he scarcely ever had used, out of regard to  the timidity and anxiety of his wife in reference to it. Shortly after  he left the house, one of the elders of his church in passing saw him  discharge one barrel at the birds. Soon after he heard the fatal report  and saw the smoke, but the trees shut out the rest from sight.... In  about half an hour after, the family assembled at breakfast, and the  servant was sent out to call him.... In a few minutes she returned,  exclaiming, 'Oh, Mr. Beecher is dead! Mr. Beecher is dead!'... In a  short time a visitor in the family, assisted by a passing laborer,  raised him up and bore him to the house. His face was pale and but  slightly marred, his eyes were closed, and over his countenance rested  the sweet expression of peaceful slumber.... Then followed the hurried  preparations for the funeral and journey, until three o'clock, when,  all arrangements being made, he was borne from his newly finished  house, through his blooming garden, to the new church, planned and  just completed under his directing eye.... The sermon and the prayers  were finished, the choir he himself had trained sung their parting  hymn, and at about five the funeral train started for a journey of over  seventy miles. That night will stand alone in the memories of those who  witnessed its scenes!    \"At ten in the evening heavy clouds gathered lowering behind, and  finally rose so as nearly to cover the hemisphere, sending forth  mutterings of thunder and constant flashes of lightning.    \"The excessive heat of the weather, the darkness of the night, the  solitary road, the flaring of the lamps and lanterns, the flashes of  the lightning, the roll of approaching thunder, the fear of being  overtaken in an unfrequented place and the lights extinguished by the  rain, the sad events of the day, the cries of the infant boy sick with  the heat and bewailing the father who ever before had soothed his  griefs, all combined to awaken the deepest emotions of the sorrowful,  the awful, and the sublime....    \"And so it is at last; there must come a time when all that the most  heart-broken, idolizing love can give us is a coffin and a grave! All  that could be done for our brother, with all his means and all the  affection of his people and friends, was just this, no more! After all,  the deepest and most powerful argument for the religion of Christ is  its power in times like this. Take from us Christ and what He taught,  and what have we here? What confusion, what agony, what dismay, what  wreck and waste! But give Him to us, even the most stricken heart can  rise under the blow; yea, even triumph!    \"'Thy brother shall rise again,' said Jesus; and to us who weep  He speaks: 'Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are made partakers of Christ's  sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye also may be glad  with exceeding joy!'\"    The"]]]
