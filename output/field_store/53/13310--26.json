[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#19)"],[1,"poor girls began to spell a long  dismal sermon delivered at Bethesda Chapel, Liverpool, on behalf of the  mission for the Chickasaw Indians. Was it not a charming evening?    At ten the servants were told to call Sir Pitt and the household to  prayers.  Sir Pitt came in first, very much flushed, and rather  unsteady in his gait; and after him the butler, the canaries, Mr.  Crawley's man, three other men, smelling very much of the stable, and  four women, one of whom, I remarked, was very much overdressed, and who  flung me a look of great scorn as she plumped down on her knees.    After Mr. Crawley had done haranguing and expounding, we received our  candles, and then we went to bed; and then I was disturbed in my  writing, as I have described to my dearest sweetest Amelia.    Good night.  A thousand, thousand, thousand kisses!    Saturday.--This morning, at five, I heard the shrieking of the little  black pig.  Rose and Violet introduced me to it yesterday; and to the  stables, and to the kennel, and to the gardener, who was picking fruit  to send to market, and from whom they begged hard a bunch of hot-house  grapes; but he said that Sir Pitt had numbered every \"Man Jack\" of  them, and it would be as much as his place was worth to give any away.  The darling girls caught a colt in a paddock, and asked me if I would  ride, and began to ride themselves, when the groom, coming with horrid  oaths, drove them away.    Lady Crawley is always knitting the worsted.  Sir Pitt is always tipsy,  every night; and, I believe, sits with Horrocks, the butler. Mr.  Crawley always reads sermons in the evening, and in the morning is  locked up in his study, or else rides to Mudbury, on county business,  or to Squashmore, where he preaches, on Wednesdays and Fridays, to the  tenants there.    A hundred thousand grateful loves to your dear papa and mamma.  Is your  poor brother recovered of his rack-punch? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! How men  should beware of wicked punch!    Ever and ever thine own REBECCA    Everything considered, I think it is quite as well for our dear Amelia  Sedley, in Russell Square, that Miss Sharp and she are parted.  Rebecca  is a droll funny creature, to be sure; and those descriptions of the  poor lady weeping for the loss of her beauty, and the gentleman \"with  hay-coloured whiskers and straw-coloured hair,\" are very smart,  doubtless, and show a great knowledge of the world.  That she might,  when on her knees, have been thinking of something better than Miss  Horrocks's ribbons, has possibly struck both of us.  But my kind reader  will please to remember that this history has \"Vanity Fair\" for a  title, and that Vanity Fair is a very vain, wicked, foolish place, full  of all sorts of humbugs and falsenesses and pretensions.  And while the  moralist, who is holding forth on the cover ( an accurate portrait of  your humble servant), professes to wear neither gown nor bands, but  only the very same long-eared livery in which his congregation is  arrayed: yet, look you, one is bound to speak the truth as far as one  knows it, whether one mounts a cap and bells or a shovel hat; and a  deal of disagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an  undertaking.    I have heard a brother of the story-telling trade, at Naples, preaching  to a pack of good-for-nothing honest lazy fellows by the sea-shore,  work himself up into such a rage and passion with some of the villains  whose wicked deeds he was describing and inventing, that the audience  could not resist it; and they and the poet together would burst out  into a roar of oaths and execrations against the fictitious monster of  the tale, so that the hat went round, and the bajocchi tumbled into it,  in the midst of a perfect storm of sympathy.    At the little Paris theatres, on the other hand, you will not only hear  the people yelling out \"Ah gredin! Ah monstre:\" and cursing the tyrant  of the play from the boxes; but the actors themselves positively refuse  to play the wicked parts, such as those of infames Anglais, brutal  Cossacks, and what not, and prefer to appear at a smaller salary, in  their real characters as loyal Frenchmen.  I set the two stories one  against the other, so that you may see that it is not from mere  mercenary motives that the present performer is desirous to show up and  trounce his villains; but because he has a sincere hatred of them,  which he cannot keep down, and which must find a vent in suitable abuse  and bad language.    I warn my \"kyind friends,\" then, that I am going to tell a story of  harrowing villainy and complicated--but, as I trust, intensely  interesting--crime.  My rascals are no milk-and-water rascals, I  promise you.  When we come to the proper places we won't spare fine  language--No, no! But when we are going over the quiet country we must  perforce be calm.  A tempest in a slop-basin is absurd.  We will  reserve that sort of thing for the mighty ocean and the lonely  midnight.  The present Chapter is very mild.  Others--But we will not  anticipate THOSE.    And, as we bring our characters forward, I will ask leave, as a man and  a brother, not only to introduce them, but occasionally to step down  from the platform, and talk about them: if they are good and kindly, to  love them and shake them by the hand: if they are silly, to laugh at  them confidentially in the reader's sleeve: if they are wicked and  heartless, to abuse them in the strongest terms which politeness admits  of.    Otherwise you might fancy it was I who was sneering at the practice of  devotion, which Miss Sharp finds so ridiculous; that it was I who  laughed good-humouredly at the reeling old Silenus of a  baronet--whereas the laughter comes from one who has no reverence  except for prosperity, and no eye for anything beyond success. Such  people there are living and flourishing in the world--Faithless,  Hopeless, Charityless: let us have at them, dear friends, with might  and main. Some there are, and very successful too, mere quacks and  fools: and it was to combat and expose such as those, no doubt, that  Laughter was made.        CHAPTER IX    Family Portraits    Sir Pitt Crawley was a philosopher with a taste for what is called low  life.  His first marriage with the daughter of the noble Binkie had  been made under the auspices of his parents; and as he often told Lady  Crawley in her lifetime she was such a confounded quarrelsome high-bred  jade that when she died he was hanged if he would ever take another of  her sort, at her ladyship's demise he kept his promise, and selected  for a second wife Miss Rose Dawson, daughter of Mr. John Thomas Dawson,  ironmonger, of Mudbury. What a happy woman was Rose to be my Lady  Crawley!    Let us set down the items of her happiness.  In the first place, she  gave up Peter Butt, a young man who kept company with her, and in  consequence of his disappointment in love, took to smuggling, poaching,  and a thousand other bad courses.  Then she quarrelled, as in duty  bound, with all the friends and intimates of her youth, who, of course,  could not be received by my Lady at Queen's Crawley--nor did she find  in her new rank and abode any persons who were willing to welcome her.  Who ever did? Sir Huddleston Fuddleston had three daughters who all  hoped to be Lady Crawley.  Sir Giles Wapshot's family were insulted  that one of the Wapshot girls had not the preference in the marriage,  and the remaining baronets of the county were indignant at their  comrade's misalliance.  Never mind the commoners, whom we will leave to  grumble anonymously.    Sir Pitt did not care, as he said, a brass farden for any one of them.  He had his pretty Rose, and what more need a man require than to please  himself? So he used to get drunk every night: to beat his pretty Rose  sometimes: to leave her in Hampshire when he went to London for the  parliamentary session, without a single friend in the wide world.  Even  Mrs. Bute Crawley, the Rector's wife, refused to visit her, as she said  she would never give the pas to a tradesman's daughter.    As the only endowments with which Nature had gifted Lady Crawley were  those of pink cheeks and a white skin, and as she had no sort of  character, nor talents, nor opinions, nor occupations, nor amusements,  nor that vigour of soul and ferocity of temper which often falls to the  lot of entirely foolish women, her hold upon Sir Pitt's affections was  not very great.  Her roses faded out of her cheeks, and the pretty  freshness left her figure after the birth of a couple of children, and  she became a mere machine in her husband's house of no more use than  the late Lady Crawley's grand piano. Being a light-complexioned woman,  she wore light clothes, as most blondes will, and appeared, in  preference, in draggled sea-green, or slatternly sky-blue.  She worked  that worsted day and night, or other pieces like it.  She had  counterpanes in the course of a few years to all the beds in Crawley.  She had a small flower-garden, for which she had rather an affection;  but beyond this no other like or disliking.  When her husband was rude  to her she was apathetic: whenever he struck her she cried.  She had  not character enough to take to drinking, and moaned about, slipshod  and in curl-papers all day.  O Vanity Fair--Vanity Fair! This might  have been, but for you, a cheery lass--Peter Butt and Rose a happy man  and wife, in a snug farm, with a hearty family; and an honest portion  of pleasures, cares, hopes and struggles--but a title and a coach and  four are toys more precious than happiness in Vanity Fair: and if Harry  the Eighth or Bluebeard were alive now, and wanted a tenth wife, do you  suppose he could not get the prettiest girl that shall be presented  this season?    The languid dulness of their mamma did not, as it may be supposed,  awaken much affection in her little daughters, but they were very happy  in the servants' hall and in the stables; and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#19)"],[1,"as he  thought best, displacing tons of loose stone and even small rocks  at every movement. Helen, nothing daunted, was eager to follow, and  although she quivered with excitement at the noise, echoed back from the  opposite hills, lost no time in preparing to descend. Her first movement  sent such showers of rubble down upon F---- and his horse, that I really  thought the latter would have been knocked off his legs. \"If you _could_  keep a little more to the right, so as to send the stones clear of me,  I should be very grateful,\" shouted F----, who was actually near the  bottom of the hill already, so sharp had been the angles of his horse's  descent. I felt afraid of attempting to guide Helen, lest the least  check should send us both head over heels into the quagmire below, and  yet it seemed dreadful to cause the death of one's husband by rolling  down cart loads of stones upon him. It could not have been more than  five minutes before Helen and I stood side by side with Leo, on the only  bit of firm ground at the edge of the morass. I believe I was as white  as my pocket handkerchief; and if fright could turn a person's hair  grey, I had been sufficiently alarmed to make myself eligible for any  quantity of walnut pomade.    Fortunately the summer had proved rather a dry one, and the swamp was  not so wet as it would have been after a heavy rain-fall. The horses  stepped carefully from flax bushes to \"nigger heads\" (as the very old  blackened grass stumps are called), resting hardly a moment anywhere,  and avoiding all the most seductive looking spots. I thought my  companion must have gone suddenly mad, when, a hawk rising up almost  from beneath our horses' feet, he flung himself off his saddle and cried  out, \"A late hawk's nest, I declare!\" And so it proved, for a little  searching in a sheltered and tolerably dry spot revealed a couple of  eggs, precisely like hens' eggs, until broken, when their delicate pale  green inner membrane betrayed their dangerous origin. It is chiefly  owing to this practice of laying in swamps that the various kinds of  hawk increase and thrive as they do, for if it were possible to get  at them, the shepherds would soon exterminate the sworn foe of  their chickens and pigeons. They are also the great drawback to the  introduction of pheasants and partridges, for the young birds have not a  chance in the open against even a sparrow-hawk.    Although it is a digression, I must tell you here how, one beautiful  early winter's day, I was standing in the verandah at my own home, when  one of our pigeons, chased by a hawk, flew right into my face and its  pursuer was so close and so heated by the chase, that it flung itself  also with great violence against my head, with a scream of rage and  triumph, hurting me a good deal as it dug its cruel, armed heel into my  cheek. The pigeon had fluttered, stunned and exhausted to the ground,  and, quick as lightning I stooped to pick it up; so great had been  the impetus of the hawk's final charge that he had never perceived his  victim had escaped him. The cunning of these birds must be seen to be  believed. I have often watched a wary old hawk perched most impudently  on the stock-yard rails, waiting until a rash chicken or duckling  should, in spite of its mother's warning clucks of terror, insist on  coming out from under her sheltering wings. If I took an umbrella, or a  croquet mallet, or a walking stick, and went out, the bird would remain  quite unmoved, even if I held my weapon pointed gun-wise towards him.  But let anyone take a real gun and hold it ever so well hidden behind  their back, and emerge ever so cautiously from the shelter of the  shrubs, my fine gentleman was off directly, mounting out of sight with a  few strokes of his powerful wings, and uttering a shriek of derision as  he departed. Nothing is so rare as a successful shot at a hawk.    We consoled ourselves however on this occasion, by reflecting that we  had annihilated two young hawks before they had commenced their lives  of rapine and robbery, and rode on our way rejoicing, to find Ned Palmer  sitting outside his but door on a log of drift wood, making, candles. In  the more primitive days of the settlement, the early settlers must have  been as badly off for light, during the long dark winter evenings, as  are even now the poorer inhabitants of Greenland or of Iceland, for  their sole substitute for candles consisted of a pannikin half filled  with melted tallow, in which a piece of cork and an apology for a wick  floated. But by my time all this had long been past and over, and even  a back-country shepherd had a nice tin mould in which he could make a  dozen candles of the purest tallow at a time.    Ned was just running a slender piece of wood through the loops of his  twisted cotton wicks, so as to keep them above the rim of the mould, and  the strong odour of melted mutton fat was tainting the lovely fresh air.  But New Zealand run-holders have often to put up with queer smells as  well as sights and sounds, therefore we only complimented Ned on being  provident enough to make a good stock of candles before-hand, for home  consumption, during the coming dark days. After we had dismounted and  hobbled our horses with the stirrup leathers, so that they could move  about and nibble the sweet blue grass growing under each sheltering  tussock, I sat down on a large stone near, and began to tell Ned how  often I had watched the negroes in Jamaica making candles after a  similar fashion, only they use the wax from the wild bee nests instead  of tallow, which was a rare and scarce thing in that part of the world.  I described to him the thick orange-coloured wax candles which used to  be the delight of my childhood, giving out a peculiar perfuming odour  after they had been burning for an hour or two,--an odour made up of  honey and the scent of heavy tropic flowers.    Ned listened to my little story with much politeness, and then, feeling  it incumbent on him to contribute to the conversation, remarked, \"I  never makes candles ma'am without I thinks of frost-bites.\"    \"How is that, Palmer?\" I asked, laughingly. \"What in the world have they  to do with each other?\"    \"Well, ma'am, you see it was just in this way. It was afore I come  here, which is quite a lively, sociable place compared to Dodson's back  country out-station, at the foot o' those there ranges beyond. I give  you my word, ma'am, it used always to make me feel as if I was dead,  and living in a lonely eternity. Them clear, bright-blue _glassers_  (glaciers, he meant, I presume) was awful lonesome, and as for a human  being they never come a-nigh the place. Well as I was saying, ma'am, one  day I finds I had run out o' candles, and as the long dark evenings (for  it was the height o' winter) was bad enough, even with a dip burning, to  show me old Spot's face for company, I set to work, hot haste, to make  some more. It was bitter, biting cold, you bet, ma'am; and I was hard at  work--just after I had had my bit o' breakfast, before I went out for to  look round my boundary--melting and making my dips, so that they might  be fine and hard for night. I ought praps to mention that Spot used to  get so close to the fire-place, that as often as not, I dropped a mossel  of the hot grease on the dog; and if it touched a thin place in his  coat, he would jump up howling. Well, ma'am, I was pouring a pannikin  full o' biling tallow into the mould, when poor old Spot he gives a  sudden howl and yell, and runs to the door. I paid no attention to him  at the time, for I was so busy; but he went on leaping up and howling as  if he had gone mad. As soon as I could put down the pannikin out o'  my hand, I went to the door meaning to open it and,--sorry am I to say  it,--kick the poor beast out for making such a row about a drop o' hot  grease. But the dog turned his face round on me, and gave me a look  as much as to say, 'Make haste, do; there's a good chap: I ought to  be outside there.' And what with the sense shinin' in his eyes, and  a curious kind o' sound outside, I takes down the bar (for the door  wouldn't stay shut otherwise), and looks out. Never until my dyin' day,  and not even then, I expect, shall I forget what the dog and I saw lying  on the ground, which was all white and hard with frost, the sun not  having got over the East range yet. The dog he had more sense and a deal  more pluck than I had, for he knows there aint a moment to be lost; and  he runs up to the flat, tumbled-down heap o' clothes, gets on its back  (for no face could I see), so as to be doing something, and not losing  time, and begins licking. Not very far off there was a lean horse  standing, but he didn't seem to like to come through the slip-rail o'  the paddock fence.    \"In coorse I couldn't stand gaping there all day, so I went and stooped  down to the man, who was lying flat on his face, with his arms straight  out. He wasn't sensibleless (Palmer's favourite word for senseless), for  he opened his eyes, and said, \"For God's sake, mate, take me in.\" \"So  I will, mate,\" I makes reply \"and welcome you are. Can you get on your  legs, think you?\" With that he groans awful, and says, \"My legs is  friz.\" Well, I looks at his legs, and sees he was dressed in what had  been good moleskins, and high jack riding-boots, coming up to his knees;  but sure enough they was as hard as a board, and actially, if you'll  believe me, ma'am, there was a rim o' solid hice round the tops of his  boots. As for standing, he couldn't do it: his legs was no more use to  him than they was to me, and he was a tall, high fellow besides. Cold as  it was, I felt hot enough by the time I had lugged that poor man inside  my place, and got him up on my bunk. He could speak, though his voice  was weak as weak could be, and he helped me as well as he could by  catching hold with his arms, but his legs was stone dead. I had to get  the tommy ("]]]
