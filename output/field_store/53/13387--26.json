Those bake thei by the Sonne, and so eate them. And this kinde of meate  onely, serueth them all they life tyme plentifully and enough, and neuer  waxeth fulsome vnto theim. Thei neuer haue warre one with another, but with  Lions, whiche comyng out of the deserte there, partly for shadowe, and  partly for to praie vpon smaller beastes, doe oftymes wourie diuers of the  Æthiopes, comyng out of the Fennes. In so muche that that nation had long  sences bene vttrely destroyed by the Lions, excepte nature of purpose, had  shewed them her aide. For toward the dogge daies, there come into that  coaste, infinite swarmes of Gnattes, without any drifte of winde to enforce  them. The men then flieng to the fennes, are not harmed by them. But thei  driue the Lions with their stingyng and terrible buszyng, cleane out of  that quartre. Next vpon these, bordre the Ilophagi and Spermatophagi, the  one liuynge by suche fruicte as falleth from the trees, in Sommer, and the  residew of the yere by suche herbes as thei picke vp in the shadowed  groundes. The other, the Ilophagi, siekynge to the plaines with their wiues  and their children, climbe trees, and gather, eate, and cary home: the  tendre croppes and buddes of the boughes. And thei haue by continualle  practise, suche a nimblenes in climbyng, that (a wondrefull thynge to be  spoken) thei wille leape from boughe to boughe, and tree to tree like  Cattes or Squirelles, and by reason of their slendrenes and lightenes,  wille mounte vp on braunches and twigges, without daunger or hurte. For  thoughe their fiete slippe, yet hange thei feste by the handes: and if thei  bothe faile theim, yet falle thei so light, that thei be harmelesse.    These folkes go naked, and hold their wiues and children in commune. Emong  them selues they fighte for their places without weapon: but against  foreiners with staues. And wheare thei ouercome, there chalenge thei  Lordeshippe. Thei communely dye for hongre, when their sight faileth them:  whiche was their onely instrumente to finde their foode. The residewe of  the countrie there aboute, do those Æthiopians holde, which are named  Cynecy, not very many in nombre, but muche differing in life from the rest.  For their Countrie beyng wooddie, and wilde, fulle of thicquettes, and  skante of watre, thei are forced by night, for feare of wilde beastes, to  slepe in trees: and toward the mornyng, all weaponed together, to drawe  doune to the waters, wher thei shroude them selues into couert, and so  abide close till the heate of the daie. At the whiche tyme the Bugles,  Pardales, and other greate beastes, what for the heate, and what for  thriste, flocke toguether to the watres. Assone as thei haue druncken, and  haue well laden their beallies with watre, the Ethiopes startynge out vpon  them with stakes, sharpened and hardened in the fire, and with stones, and  with arrowes, and suche like weapon, at this aduauntage, slea them vpon  heapes, and deuide the carkesses by compaignies to be eaten. And sometyme  it happeneth that thei theim selues are slaine by some beast of force,  howbeit very seldome. For thei euer by their pollicies and traines, doe  more damage to the beastes, then the beastes can doe vnto them. If at any  time thei lacke the bodies of the beastes, then take thei the rawe hides of  suche as thei lateliest before had slaine, and clensyng them cleane fro the  heare, thei sokynglie laie them to a softe fire; and when thei be throughly  hette, deuide them emong the compaignie, whiche very griedely fille  themselues of them.    They exercise their children whilest thei be boies, to throw the darte at a  sette marke, and he that hitteth not the marke receiueth no meate. By the  whiche maner of trainyng, hongre so worketh in the boies that thei become  excellente darters.    The Acridophagie (a people borderyng vpon the deaserte) are somewhat lower  of stature then the residewe, leane, and exceding blacke. In the Spring  time, the Weste, and Southwest winde, bringeth vnto them out of the  Deaserte, an houge nombre of Locustes, whiche are of verie greate bodie,  and of wynge very filthily coloured. The Ethiopians well accustomed with  their maner of flighte and trade, gather together into a long slade  betwixte two hilles, a great deale of rubbeshe and mullocke, from places  nighe hande, apte for fingry, and the grasse and all wiedes there aboute.  And laieng it ready in heapes aforehande, a long the slade, when thei see  the Locustes come with the winde like cloudes in the aire, thei set al on  fire, and so swelte theim in the passing ouer, that thei bee skante full  out of the slade, but thei fall to the grounde in suche plentie, that thei  be to all the Acridophagi, a sufficient victuallyng. For thei poudre them  with salte (wherof the countrie hath plentie) and so continually from yere  to yere, liue by none other foode. For thei neither haue any kinde of  catteille, ne fisshe can haue, beyng so farre fro the sea. And this maner  of meate siemeth to theim, verie pleasaunte and fine.    Of bodie thei are very lighte, swifte of foote, and shorte liued as not  passyng xl. yeres, he that liueth longest. Their ende is not more  incredible, then it is miserable. For when their drawe into age, their  briedeth a kinde of winghed lice in their bodies, of diuers colours, and  very horrible, and filthie to beholde: whiche firste eate out their  bealies, and then their brest, and so the whole body in a litle space. He  that hath this disease, first as thoughe he had on hym some tickelyng  ytche, all to beskratcheth his bodie with suche pleasure, as is also  mingled with some smart, And within a litle while aftre, when the lyce  beginne to craule, and the bodie beginneth to mattre, enraged with the  bittrenes and grief of the disease, he teareth and mangleth his whole bodie  with his nailes, putting furth in the mean while many a greuous grone. Then  gussheth there out of hym, suche aboundaunce of lice, that a manne would  thinke they had bene barelled in his body: and that the barel now broken,  the swarme plomped out. And by this meanes, whether throughe the enfectious  aire, or the corrupcion of their fieding, thei make a miserable ende.    Vpon the Southe border of Affrike, dwell there menne called of the Grekes  Cynnamie, and of their neighbours Sauluages: Bearded, and that with  aboundaunce of heare. Thei kiepe for the saufegarde of their liues, greate  compaignies of wilde Mastiues: for that from midde Iune, till midde Winter,  there entreth into their countrie, an innumerable sorte of Kine of Inde.  Whether thei flie thether to saue them selues from other beastes, or come  to sieke pasture, or by some instincte of nature vnknowen to manne, it is  vncertaine. Against these, when the menne of their owne force, are not able  to resist: thei defende themselues by the helpe of their dogges, and take  many of them. Whereof thei eate parte whilest thei are freshe, and parte  reserue thei in pouldre, for their aftre niede. Thei eate also many other  kindes of beastes, whiche thei hunt with their dogges.    The laste of all the Affriens Southewarde, are the Ichthiophagi. A people  borderyng vpon the Troglodities, in the Goulfe called Sinus Arabicus:  whiche vnder the shape of man, liue the life of beastes. Thei goe naked all  their life time, and make compte of their wiues and their children in  commune. Thei knowe none other kindes of pleasure or displeasure, but like  vnto beastes, suche as thei fiele: neither haue thei any respecte to  vertue, or vice, or any discernyng betwixte goode or badde. Thei haue litle  Cabanes not farre from the Sea, vpon the clieues sides: where nature hath  made greate carfes, diepe into the grounde, and hollowe Guttres, and  Criekes into the maigne lande, bowting and compayng in and out, to and fro,  many sondrie waies. Whose entringes thenhabitauntes vse to stoppe vp with  great heapes of calion and stones, whereby the criekes serue them now in  the steade of nettes. For when the sea floweth (which happeneth there twise  in the daye, aboute the houres of thre, and of nyne) the water swelleth so  highe, that it ouerfloweth into the maigne shore, and filleth those  crieques with the sea. And the fisshe folowing the tide, and dispersinge  them selues abrode in the maigne londe to seeke their foode: at the ebbe  when the water withdraweth, retiring together with it alway to the dieper  places, and at laste remaining in these gutters and crieques, they are  stopped in with the stone heapes, and at the lowe water lye drie. Then come  the enhabitauntes with wyfe and children, take them, and laye them oute  vpon the rocques against the midday sonne, wher, with the broiling heate of  the same, they be within a while skorched and parched. Then do they remoue  them, and with a litle beating separate the fysshe fro the bones. Then put  they the fisshe into the hollowes of the rocques, and beat it to pomois,  minglinge therewith the side of the whynne Paliurus. And so facion it into  lumpes muche like a bricke, but somewhat longer. And when they haue taken  them againe a litle by the sonne, they sitte them downe together, and eate  by the bealy.    Of this haue thei alway in store, accordinge to the plenty that Neptune  gyueth them. But when by the reason of tempest the sea ouerfloweth these  places aboue his naturall course, and tarieth longer then his wonte, so  that they can not haue this benefight of fisshing, and their store is all  spent: they gather a kynde of great shelle fysshe, whose shelles they grate  open with stones, and eate the fisshe rawe, in taste muche like to an  oyster. If it fortune this ouerflowing by the reason of the winde, to  continue longe, and their shellefysshe to fayle them: then haue they  recours to the fysshebones (which they do of purpose reserue together in  heapes) and when thei haue gnabeled of the softest and gristely partes with  their tiethe,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8112"],[0,"Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines (#19)"],[1,"in food. The Blackfeet,  during the buffalo hunt, follow the herds on horseback in large  parties, composed of men, women, and children. When the active  pursuit of the herd commences, the hunters leave the dead animals in  the track of the chase to be appropriated by the first persons who  come up behind. This method of distribution is continued until all  are supplied. All the Indian tribes who hunt upon the plains, with  the exception of the half-blood Crees, observe the same custom of  making a common stock of the capture. It tended to equalize, at the  outset, the means of subsistence obtained. They cut the beef into  strings, and either dried it in the air or in the smoke of a fire.  Some of the tribes made a part of the capture into pemmican, which  consists of dried and pulverized meat mixed with melted buffalo fat,  which is baled in the hide of the animal.    During the fishing season in the Columbia River, where fish are more  abundant than in any other river on the earth, all the members of  the tribe encamp together, and make a common stock of the fish  obtained. They are divided each day according to the number of women,  giving to each an equal share. At the Kootenay Falls, for example,  they are taken by spearing, and in huge baskets submerged in the  water below the falls. The salmon, during the spring run, weigh from  six to forty pounds, and are taken in the greatest abundance, three  thousand a day not being an unusual number. Father De Smet, the late  Oregon missionary, informed the writer, in 1862, that he once spent  several days with the Kootenays at these falls, and that the share  which fell to him, as one of the party, loaded, when dried, thirty  pack mules. The fish are split open, scarified, and dried on  scaffolds, after which they are packed in baskets and then removed  to their villages. This custom makes a general distribution of the  capture, and leaves each household in possession of its share.    [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy footnote relocated to chapter end.]    Their communism in living is involved in the size of the household,  which ranged from ten to forty persons. \"The houses of the Sokulks  are made of large mats of rushes, and are generally of a square or  oblong form, varying in length from fifteen to sixty feet; the top  is covered with mats, leaving a space of twelve or fifteen inches,  the whole length of the house, for the purpose of admitting the  light and suffering the smoke to pass through; the roof is nearly  flat ... and the house is not divided into apartments, the fire  being in the middle of the large room, and immediately under the  hole in the roof.... On entering one of these houses he [Captain  Clarke] found it crowded with men, women, and children, who  immediately provided a mat for him to sit on, and one of the party  immediately undertook to prepare something to eat.\" [Footnote: Lewis  and Clarke's Travels, pp. 351-353.]    Again: \"He landed before five houses close to each other, but no one  appeared, and the doors, which were of mats, were closed. He went  towards one of them with a pipe in his hand, and pushing aside the  mat entered the lodge, where he found thirty-two persons, chiefly  men and women, with a few children, all in the greatest consternation.\"  [Footnote: ib., p. 357.] And again: \"This village being part of the  same nation with the village we passed above, the language of the  two being the same, and their houses being of the same form and  materials, and calculated to contain about thirty souls.\"  [Footnote: ib., p. 376.]    In enumerating the people Lewis and Clarke often state the number of  inhabitants with the number of houses, thus:    \"The Killamucks, who number fifty houses and a thousand souls.\"    \"The Chilts, who ... are estimated at seven hundred souls and  thirty-eight houses.\"    \"The Clamoitomish, of twelve houses and two hundred and sixty souls.\"    \"The Potoashees, of ten houses and two hundred souls.\"    \"The Pailsk, of ten houses and two hundred souls.\"    \"The Quinults, of sixty houses and one thousand souls.\"    [Footnote: Lewis and Clarke's Travels, pp. 426-428.]    Speaking generally of the usages and customs of the tribes of the  \"Columbia plains,\" they make the following statements: \"Their large  houses usually contain several families, consisting of the parents,  their sons and daughters-in-law and grandchildren, among whom the  provisions are common, and whose harmony is scarcely ever  interrupted by disputes. Although polygamy is permitted by their  customs, very few have more than a single wife, and she is brought  immediately after the marriage into the husband's family, where she  resides until increasing numbers oblige them to seek another house.  In this state the old man is not considered the head of the family,  since the active duties, as well as the responsibility, fall on some  of the younger members. As these families gradually expand into bands,  or tribes, or nations, the paternal authority is represented by the  chief of each association. This chieftain, however, is not hereditary.\"  [Footnote: ib., p. 443.] Here we find among the Columbian tribes, as  elsewhere, communism in living, but restricted to large households  composed of several families.    A writer in Harper's Magazine, speaking of the Aleutians, remarks:  \"When first discovered this people were living in large yurts, or  dirt houses, partially underground ... having the entrances through  a hole in the top or centre, going in and out on a rude ladder.  Several of these ancient yurts were very large, as shown by the ruins,  being from thirty to eighty yards long and twenty to forty in width....  In these large yurts the primitive Aleuts lived by fifties and  hundreds for the double object of protection and warmth.\"  [Footnote: Harper's Magazine, vol. 55, p. 806.]    Whether these tribes at this time were organized in gentes and  phratries is not known. At the time of the Wilkes expedition  (1838-1842) the gentile organization did not exist among them;  neither does it now exist; but it is still found among the tribes  of the Northwest Coast, and among the Indian tribes generally. The  composition of the household, as here described, is precisely like  the household of the Iroquois prior to A.D. 1700.    The Mandan village contained at the time of Catlin's visit (1832),  as elsewhere stated, about fifty houses and about fifteen hundred  people. \"These cabins are so spacious,\" Catlin remarks, \"that they  hold from twenty to forty persons--a family and all their connections....  From the great numbers of the inmates in these lodges they are  necessarily very spacious, and the number of beds considerable. It  is no uncommon thing to see these lodges fifty feet in diameter  inside (which is an immense room), with a row of these curtained  beds extending quite around their sides, being some ten or twelve of  them, placed four or five feet apart, and the space between them  occupied by a large post, fixed quite firmly in the ground, and six  or seven feet high, with large wooden pegs or bolts in it, on which  are hung or grouped, with a wild and startling taste, the arms and  armor of the respective proprietors.\" [Footnote: North American  Indians, Philadelphia ed., 1857, i, 139.]    The household, according to the custom of the Indians, was a large  one. The number of inhabitants divided among the number of houses  would give an average of thirty persons to each house. It is evident  from several statements of Catlin before given that the household  practiced communism in living, and that it was formed of related  families, on the principle of gentile kin, as among the Iroquois.  Elsewhere he intimates that the Mandans kept a public store or  granary as a refuge for the whole community in a time of scarcity.  [Footnote: ib., i, 210.]    In like manner Carver, speaking generally of the usages and customs  of the Dakota tribes and of the tribes of Wisconsin, remarks that  \"they will readily share with any of their own tribe the last part  of their provisions, and even with those of a different nation, if  they chance to come in when they are eating. Though they do not keep  one common store, yet that community of goods which is so prevalent  among them, and their generous disposition, render it nearly of the  same effect.\" [Footnote: Travels, etc, p. 171.]    What this author seems to state is that community of goods existed  in the household, and that it was lengthened out to the tribe by the  law of hospitality. Elsewhere, speaking of the large village of the  Sauks, he says: \"This is the largest Indian town I ever saw. It  contains about ninety houses, each large enough for several families.\"  [Footnote: Travels, etc., Phila. ed. 1796, p. 29.]    In a previous chapter (supra p. 49.) Heckewelder's observations upon  hospitality among the Delawares and Munsees, implying the principle  of communism, have been given. He remarks further that \"there is  nothing in an Indian's house or family without its particular owner.  Every individual knows what belongs to him, from the horse or cow  down to the dog, cat, kitten, and little chicken.... For a litter of  kittens or a brood of chickens there are often as many different  owners as there are individual animals. In purchasing a hen with her  brood one frequently has to deal for it with several children. Thus,  while the principle of community of goods prevails in the State, the  rights of property are acknowledged among the members of the family.  This is attended with a very good effect, for by this means every  living creature is properly taken care of.\" [Footnote: Indian Nations,  p. 158.]    I do not understand what Heckewelder means by the remark that  \"the principle of community of goods prevails in the state,\" unless  it be that the rule of hospitality was so all-pervading that it was  tantamount to a community of goods, while individual property was  everywhere"]]]
