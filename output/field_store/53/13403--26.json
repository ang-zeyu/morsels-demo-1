I was fightin' for Dinah Shadd an' that cut on my cheek.  What hope had he forninst me? 'Stand up,' sez I, time an' again whin he  was beginnin' to quarter the ground an' gyard high an' go large. 'This  isn't ridin'-school,' I sez. 'O man, stand up an' let me get in at ye.'  But whin I saw he wud be runnin' about, I grup his shtock in my left an'  his waist-belt in my right an' swung him clear to my right front, head  undher, he hammerin' my nose till the wind was knocked out av him on the  bare ground. 'Stand up,' sez I, 'or I'll kick your head into your chest!'  and I wud ha' done ut too, so ragin' mad I was.    \"'My collar-bone's bruk,' sez he. 'Help me back to lines. I'll walk wid  her no more.' So I helped him back.\"    \"And was his collar-bone broken?\" I asked, for I fancied that only Learoyd  could neatly accomplish that terrible throw.    \"He pitched on his left shoulder point. Ut was. Next day the news was in  both barricks, an' whin I met Dinah Shadd wid a cheek on me like all the  reg'mintal tailor's samples there was no 'Good mornin', corp'ril,' or  aught else. 'An' what have I done, Miss Shadd,' sez I, very bould,  plantin' mesilf forninst her, 'that ye should not pass the time of day?'    \"'Ye've half-killed rough-rider Dempsey,' sez she, her dear blue eyes  fillin' up.    \"'May be,' sez I. 'Was he a friend av yours that saw ye home four times in  the fortnight?'    \"'Yes,' sez she, but her mouth was down at the corners, 'An'--an' what's  that to you?' she sez.    \"'Ask Dempsey,' sez I, purtendin' to go away.    \"'Did you fight for me then, ye silly man?' she sez, tho' she knew ut all  along.    \"'Who else?' sez I, an' I tuk wan pace to the front.    \"'I wasn't worth ut,' sez she, fingerin' in her apron.    \"'That's for me to say,' sez I. 'Shall I say ut?'    \"'Yes,' sez she, in a saint's whisper, an' at that I explained mesilf; and  she tould me what ivry man that is a man, an' many that is a woman, hears  wanst in his life.    \"'But what made ye cry at startin', Dinah, darlin'?' sez I.    \"'Your--your bloody cheek,' sez she, duckin' her little head down on my  sash (I was on duty for the day) an' whimperin' like a sorrowful angil.    \"Now a man cud take that two ways. I tuk ut as pleased me best an' my  first kiss wid ut.

Thin we  wint hand in hand to ould Mother Shadd like two little childher, an' she  said 'twas no bad thing, an' ould Shadd nodded behind his pipe, an' Dinah  ran away to her own room. That day I throd on rollin' clouds. All earth  was too small to hould me. Begad, I cud ha' hiked the sun out av the sky  for a live coal to my pipe, so magnificent I was. But I tuk recruities at  squad-drill instid, an' began wid general battalion advance whin I shud  ha' been balance-steppin' them. Eyah! that day! that day!\"    A very long pause. \"Well?\" said I.    \"'Twas all wrong,\" said Mulvaney, with an enormous sigh. \"An' I know that  ev'ry bit av ut was my own foolishness. That night I tuk maybe the half av  three pints--not enough to turn the hair of a man in his natural senses.  But I was more than half drunk wid pure joy, an' that canteen beer was so  much whisky to me, I can't tell how it came about, but _bekaze_ I had no  thought for anywan except Dinah, _bekaze_ I hadn't slipped her little  white arms from my neck five minuts, _bekaze_ the breath of her kiss was  not gone from my mouth, I must go through the married lines on my way to  quarters an' I must stay talkin' to a red-headed Mullingar heifer av a  girl, Judy Sheehy, that was daughter to Mother Sheehy, the wife of Nick  Sheehy, the canteen-sergint--the Black Curse av Shielygh be on the whole  brood that are above groun' this day!    \"'An' what are ye houldin' your head that high for, corp'ril?' sez Judy.  'Come in an' thry a cup av tay,' she sez, standin' in the doorway.

'Ye  will not mind, corp'ril?'    \"'I can endure,' sez I; ould Mother Sheehy bein' no divarsion av mine, nor  her daughter too. Judy fetched the tea things an' put thim on the table,  leanin' over me very close to get thim square. I dhrew back, thinkin' av  Dinah.    \"'Is ut afraid you are av a girl alone?' sez Judy.    \"'No,' sez I. 'Why should I be?'    \"'That rests wid the girl,' sez Judy, dhrawin' her chair next to mine.    \"'Thin there let ut rest,' sez I; an' thinkin' I'd been a trifle onpolite,  I sez, 'The tay's not quite sweet enough for my taste. Put your little  finger in the cup, Judy. 'Twill make ut necthar.'    \"'What's necthar?' sez she.    \"'Somethin' very sweet,' sez I; an' for the sinful life av me I cud not  help lookin' at her out av the corner av my eye, as I was used to look at  a woman.    \"'Go on wid ye, corp'ril,' sez she. 'You're a flirrt.'    \"'On me sowl I'm not,' sez I.    \"'Then you're a cruel handsome man, an' that's worse,' sez she, heaving  big sighs an' lookin' crossways.    \"'You know your own mind,' sez I.    \"''Twud be better for me if I did not,' she sez.    \"'There's a dale to be said on both sides av that,' sez I, unthinkin'.    \"'Say your own part av ut, then, Terence, darlin',' sez she; 'for begad  I'm thinkin' I've said too much or too little for an honest girl,' an' wid  that she put her arms round my neck an' kissed me.    \"'There's no more to be said afther that,' sez I, kissin' her back  again--Oh the mane scutt that I was, my head ringin' wid Dinah Shadd! How  does ut come about, sorr, that when a man has put the comether on wan  woman, he's sure bound to put it on another? 'Tis the same thing at  musketry, Wan day ivry shot goes wide or into the bank, an' the next, lay  high lay low, sight or snap, ye can't get off the bull's-eye for ten shots  runnin'.\"    \"That only happens to a man who has had a good deal of experience. He does  it without thinking,\" I replied.    \"Thankin' you for the complimint, sorr, ut may be so. But I'm doubtful  whether you mint ut for a complimint. Hear now; I sat there wid Judy on my  knee tellin' me all manner av nonsinse an' only sayin' 'yes' an' 'no,'  when I'd much better ha' kept tongue betune teeth. An' that was not an  hour afther I had left Dinah! What I was thinkin' av I cannot say,  Presintly. quiet as a cat, ould Mother Sheehy came in velvet-dhrunk. She  had her daughter's red hair, but 'twas bald in patches, an' I cud see in  her wicked ould face, clear as lightnin', what Judy wud be twenty years to  come. I was for jumpin' up, but Judy niver moved.    \"'Terence has promust, mother,' sez she, an' the could sweat bruk out all  over me. Ould Mother Sheehy sat down of a heap an' began playin' wid the  cups. 'Thin you're a well-matched pair,' she sez, very thick. 'For he's  the biggest rogue that iver spoiled the queen's shoe-leather,' an'--    \"'I'm off, Judy,' sez I. 'Ye should not talk nonsinse to your mother. Get  her to bed, girl.'    \"'Nonsinse!' sez the ould woman, prickin' up her ears like a cat an'  grippin' the table-edge. ''Twill be the most nonsinsical nonsinse for you,  ye grinnin' badger, if nonsinse 'tis. Git clear, you. I'm goin' to bed.'    \"I ran out into the dhark, my head in a stew an' my heart sick, but I had  sinse enough to see that I'd brought ut all on mysilf.

I will go  an' get dhrunk,' sez I, 'an' forget about ut, for 'tis plain I'm not a  marrin' man.'    \"On my way to canteen I ran against Lascelles, color-sergeant that was av  E Comp'ny, a hard, hard man, wid a torment av a wife.

An' I  tould him how the matther was.    \"He sucked in his lower lip. 'You've been thrapped,' sez he. 'Ju Sheehy  wud be the betther for a man's name to hers as soon as can.

Such was the book from      whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem.\"    One of these \"well-worn psalm-books of Ainsworth\" lies now before me,  perhaps the very one from which the lonely Priscilla sang as she sat  a-spinning.    There is something especially dear to the lover and dreamer of the olden  time, to the book-lover and antiquary as well, in an old, worn psalm or  hymn book. It speaks quite as eloquently as does an old Bible of loving  daily use, and adds the charm of interest in the quaint verse to reverence  for the sacred word. A world of tender fancies springs into life as I turn  over the pages of any old psalm-book \"reading between the lines,\" and as  I decipher the faded script on the titlepage. But this \"psalm-book of  Ainsworth,\" this book loved and used by the Pilgrims, brought over in one  of those early ships, perhaps in the \"Mayflower\" itself, this book so  symbolic of those early struggling days in New England, has a romance, a  charm, an interest which thrills every drop of Puritan blood in my veins.    It is pleasing, too, this \"Ainsworth's Version,\" aside from any thought of  its historic associations; its square pages of diversified type are well  printed, and have a quaint unfamiliar look which is intensely attractive,  and to which the odd, irregular notes of music, the curiously ornamented  head and tail pieces, and the occasional Hebrew or Greek letters add their  undefinable charm.    It is a square quarto of three hundred and forty-eight closely printed  pages, bound in time-stained but well-preserved parchment, and even the  parchment itself is interesting, and lovely to the touch. The titlepage is  missing, but I know that this is the edition printed, as was Priscilla's,  in Amsterdam in 1612 (not \"in England in 1600\" as a note written in the  last blank page states). The full title was \"The Book of Psalms. Englished  both in Prose and Metre. With annotations opening the words and sentences  by conference with other Scriptures. Eph. v: 18,19. Bee yee filled with  the Spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual-Songs  singing and making melodie in your hearts to the Lord.\" The book contains  besides the Psalms and Annotations, on its first pages, a \"Preface  declaring the reason and use of the Book;\" and at the last pages a \"Table  directing to some principal things observed in the Annotations of the  Psalms,\" a list of \"Hebrew phrases observed which are somewhat hard and  figurative,\" and also some \"General Observations touching the Psalms.\"    I can well imagine what a pious delight this book was to our Pilgrim  Fathers; and what a still greater delight it was to our Pilgrim Mothers,  in that day and country of few books. They possessed in it, not only a  wonderful new metrical version of the Psalms for singing, but a prose  version for comparison as well; and the deeply learned and profoundly  worded annotations placed at the end of each Psalm were doubtless of  special interest to such \"scripturists with all their hearts\" as they were.    There were also, \"for the use and edification of the saints,\" printed above  each psalm the airs of appropriate tunes. The \"rough-hewn, angular notes\"  are irregularly lozenge-shaped, like the notes or \"pricks\" in Queen  Elizabeth's \"Virginal-Book,\" and are placed on the staff without bars.  Ainsworth, in his preface, says, \"Tunes for the Psalms I find none set of  God: so that ech people is to use the most grave decent and comfortable  manner that they know how, according to the general rule. The singing notes  I have most taken from our Englished psalms when they will fit the mesure  of the verse: and for the other long verses I have also taken (for the most  part) the gravest and easiest tunes of the French and Dutch psalmes.\" Easy  the tunes certainly are, to the utmost degree of simplicity.    Great diversity too of type did the Pilgrims find in their Psalm-book:  Roman type, Italics, black-letter, all were used; the verse was printed in  Italics, the prose in Roman type, and the annotation in black-letter and  small Roman text with close-spaced lines. This variety though picturesque  makes the text rather difficult to read; for while one can decipher  black-letter readily enough when reading whole pages of it, when it is  interspersed with other type it makes the print somewhat confusing to the  unaccustomed eye.    One curious characteristic of the typography is the frequent use of the  hyphen, compound words or rather compound phrases being formed apparently  without English rule or reason. Such combinations as these are given as  instances: \"highly-him-preferre,\" \"renowned-name,\" \"repose-me-quietlie,\"  \"in-mind-uplay,\" \"turn-to-ashes,\" \"my-alonely-soul,\" \"beat-them-final,\"  \"pouring-out-them-hard,\" \"inveyers-mak-streight,\" and  \"condemn-thou-them-as-guilty,\"--which certainly would make fit verses to  be sung to the accompaniment of Master Mace's  \"excellent-large-plump-lusty-fullspeaking-organ.\"    Ainsworth's Version when read proves to be a scholarly book, exhibiting far  better grammar and punctuation and more uniformity of spelling than \"The  New England Psalm-book,\" which at a later date displaced Ainsworth in the  affections and religious services of the New England Puritans and Pilgrims.  Both versions are somewhat confused in sense, and of uncouth and grotesque  versification; though the metre of Ainsworth is better than the rhyme. It  is all written in \"common metre,\" nearly all in lines of eight and six  syllables alternately.    The name of the author of this version was Henry Ainsworth; he was the  greatest of all the Holland Separatists, a typical Elizabethan Puritan,  who left the church in which he was educated and attached himself to the  Separatists, or Brownists, as they were called. He went into exile in  Amsterdam in 1593, and worked for some time as a porter in a book-seller's  shop, living (as Roger Williams wrote) \"upon ninepence in the weeke with  roots boyled.\" He established, with the Reverend Mr. Johnson, the new  church in Holland; and when it was divided by dissension, he became the  pastor of the \"Ainsworthian Brownists\" and so remained for twelve years.  He was a most accomplished scholar, and was called the \"rabbi of his age.\"  Governor Bradford, in his \"Dialogue,\" written in 1648, says of Ainsworth,  \"He had not his better for the Hebrew tongue in the University nor scarce  in Europe.\" Hence, naturally, he was constantly engaged upon some work of  translating or commentating, and still so highly prized is some of his work  that it has been reprinted during this century. He also, being a skilful  disputant, wrote innumerable controversial pamphlets and books, many  of which still exist. It is said that he once had a long and spirited  controversy with a brother divine as to whether the ephod of Aaron were  blue or green. I fear we of to-day have lost much that the final, decisive  judgment from so learned scholars and students as to the correct color has  not descended to us, and now, if we wish to know, we shall have to fight it  all over again.    In spite of his power of argument (or perhaps on account of it) the most  prominent part which Ainsworth seemed to take in Amsterdam for many years  was that of peacemaker, as many of his contemporaries testify: for they  quarrelled fiercely among themselves in the exiled church, though they  had such sore need of unity and good fellowship; and they had many church  arguments and judgments and lawsuits. They quarrelled over the exercise of  power in the church; over the true meaning of the text Matthew xviii. 17;  whether the members of the congregation should be allowed to look on their  Bibles during the preaching or on their Psalm-books during the singing;  whether they should sing at all in their meetings; over the power of the  office of ruling elder (a fruitful source of dissension and disruption in  the New England congregations likewise) and above all, they quarrelled long  and bitterly over the unseemly and gay dress of the parson's wife, Madam  Johnson. These were the terrible accusations that were brought against that  bedizened Puritan: that she wore \"her bodies tied to the petticote with  points as men do their doublets and hose; contrary to I Thess. v: 22,  conferred with Deut. xx: 11;\" that she also wore \"lawn coives,\" and  \"busks,\" and \"whalebones in the petticote bodies,\" and a \"veluet hoode,\"  and a \"long white brest;\" and that she \"stood gazing bracing and vaunting  in the shop dores;\" and that \"men called her a bounceing girl\" (as if  she could help that!). And one of her worst and most bitterly condemned  offences was that she wore \"a topish hat.\" This her husband vehemently  denied; and long discussions and explanations followed on the hat's  topishness,--\"Mr. Ainsworth dilating much upon a greeke worde\" (as of  course so learned a man would). For the benefit of unlearned modern  children of the Puritans let me give the old Puritan's precise explanation  and classification of topishness. \"Though veluet in its nature were not  topish, yet if common mariners should weare such it would be a sign of  pride and topishness in them. Also a gilded raper and a feather are not  topish in their nature, neither in a captain to weare them, and yet if a  minister should weare them they would be signs of great vanity topishness  and lightness.\" I wonder that topish hat had not undone the whole Puritan  church in Holland.    In settling all these and many other disputes, in translating,  commentating, and versifying, did Henry Ainsworth pass his days; until,  worn out by hard labor, and succumbing to long continued weakness, he died  in 1623. This romantic story of his death is told by Neal. \"It was sudden  and not without suspicion of violence; for it is reported that, having  found a diamond of very great value in the streets of Amsterdam, he  advertised it in print; and"]]]
