The true story can only be  told from the intimate and personal point of view. As I intend to tell  the true story I offer no further apology for its personal character.    Before beginning a recital of the relations existing between President  Wilson and myself during the Paris Conference, I wish to state, and to  emphasize the statement, that I was never for a moment unmindful that  the Constitution of the United States confides to the President the  absolute right of conducting the foreign relations of the Republic, and  that it is the duty of a Commissioner to follow the President's  instructions in the negotiation of a treaty. Many Americans, some of  whom are national legislators and solicitous about the Constitution,  seem to have ignored or to have forgotten this delegation of exclusive  authority, with the result that they have condemned the President in  intemperate language for exercising this executive right. As to the  wisdom of the way in which Mr. Wilson exercised it in directing the  negotiations at Paris individual opinions may differ, but as to the  legality of his conduct there ought to be but one mind. From first to  last he acted entirely within his constitutional powers as President of  the United States.    The duties of a diplomatic representative commissioned by the President  and given full powers to negotiate a treaty are, in addition to the  formal carrying out of his instructions, twofold, namely, to advise the  President during the negotiation of his views as to the wise course to  be adopted, and to prevent the President, in so far as possible, from  taking any step in the proceedings which may impair the rights of his  country or may be injurious to its interests. These duties, in my  opinion, are equally imperative whether the President directs the  negotiations through written instructions issuing from the White House  or conducts them in person. For an American plenipotentiary to remain  silent, and by his silence to give the impression that he approves a  course of action which he in fact believes to be wrong in principle or  contrary to good policy, constitutes a failure to perform his full duty  to the President and to the country. It is his duty to speak and to  speak frankly and plainly.    With this conception of the obligations of a Commissioner to Negotiate  Peace, obligations which were the more compelling in my case because of  my official position as Secretary of State, I felt it incumbent upon me  to offer advice to the President whenever it seemed necessary to me to  consider the adoption of a line of action in regard to the negotiations,  and particularly so when the indications were that the President  purposed to reach a decision which seemed to me unwise or impolitic.  Though from the first I felt that my suggestions were received with  coldness and my criticisms with disfavor, because they did not conform  to the President's wishes and intentions, I persevered in my efforts to  induce him to abandon in some cases or to modify in others a course  which would in my judgment be a violation of principle or a mistake in  policy. It seemed to me that duty demanded this, and that, whatever the  consequences might be, I ought not to give tacit assent to that which I  believed wrong or even injudicious.    The principal subjects, concerning which President Wilson and I were in  marked disagreement, were the following: His presence in Paris during  the peace negotiations and especially his presence there as a delegate  to the Peace Conference; the fundamental principles of the constitution  and functions of a League of Nations as proposed or advocated by him;  the form of the organic act, known as the \"Covenant,\" its elaborate  character and its inclusion in the treaty restoring a state of peace;  the treaty of defensive alliance with France; the necessity for a  definite programme which the American Commissioners could follow in  carrying on the negotiations; the employment of private interviews and  confidential agreements in reaching settlements, a practice which gave  color to the charge of \"secret diplomacy\"; and, lastly, the admission of  the Japanese claims to possession of German treaty rights at Kiao-Chau  and in the Province of Shantung.    Of these seven subjects of difference the most important were those  relating to the League of Nations and the Covenant, though our opposite  views as to Shantung were more generally known and more frequently the  subject of public comment. While chief consideration will be given to  the differences regarding the League and the Covenant, the record would  be incomplete if the other subjects were omitted. In fact nearly all of  these matters of difference are more or less interwoven and have a  collateral, if not a direct, bearing upon one another. They all  contributed in affecting the attitude of President Wilson toward the  advice that I felt it my duty to volunteer, an attitude which was  increasingly impatient of unsolicited criticism and suggestion and which  resulted at last in the correspondence of February, 1920, that ended  with the acceptance of my resignation as Secretary of State.    The review of these subjects will be, so far as it is possible, treated  in chronological order, because, as the matters of difference increased  in number, they gave emphasis to the divergence of judgment which  existed between the President and myself. The effect was cumulative, and  tended not only to widen the breach, but to make less and less possible  a restoration of our former relations. It was my personal desire to  support the President's views concerning the negotiations at Paris, but,  when in order to do so it became necessary to deny a settled conviction  and to suppress a conception of the true principle or the wise policy to  be followed, I could not do it and feel that to give support under such  conditions accorded with true loyalty to the President of the  United States.    It was in this spirit that my advice was given and my suggestions were  made, though in doing so I believed it justifiable to conform as far as  it was possible to the expressed views of Mr. Wilson, or to what seemed  to be his views, concerning less important matters and to concentrate on  those which seemed vital. I went in fact as far as I could in adopting  his views in the hope that my advice would be less unpalatable and  would, as a consequence, receive more sympathetic consideration.  Believing that I understood the President's temperament, success in an  attempt to change his views seemed to lie in moderation and in partial  approval of his purpose rather than in bluntly arguing that it was  wholly wrong and should be abandoned. This method of approach, which  seemed the expedient one at the time, weakened, in some instances at  least, the criticisms and objections which I made. It is very possible  that even in this diluted form my views were credited with wrong motives  by the President so that he suspected my purpose. It is to be hoped that  this was the true explanation of Mr. Wilson's attitude of mind, for the  alternative forces a conclusion as to the cause for his resentful  reception of honest differences of opinion, which no one, who admires  his many sterling qualities and great attainments, will  willingly accept.    Whatever the cause of the President's attitude toward the opinions which  I expressed on the subjects concerning which our views were at  variance--and I prefer to assume that the cause was a misapprehension of  my reasons for giving them--the result was that he was disposed to give  them little weight. The impression made was that he was irritated by  opposition to his views, however moderately urged, and that he did not  like to have his judgment questioned even in a friendly way. It is, of  course, possible that this is not a true estimate of the President's  feelings. It may do him an injustice. But his manner of meeting  criticism and his disposition to ignore opposition can hardly be  interpreted in any other way.    There is the alternative possibility that Mr. Wilson was convinced that,  after he had given a subject mature consideration and reached a  decision, his judgment was right or at least better than that of any  adviser. A conviction of this nature, if it existed, would naturally  have caused him to feel impatient with any one who attempted to  controvert his decisions and would tend to make him believe that  improper motives induced the opposition or criticism. This alternative,  which is based of necessity on a presumption as to the temperament of  Mr. Wilson that an unprejudiced and cautious student of personality  would hesitate to adopt, I mention only because there were many who  believed it to be the correct explanation of his attitude. In view of my  intimate relations with the President prior to the Paris Conference I  feel that in justice to him I should say that he did not, except on rare  occasions, resent criticism of a proposed course of action, and, while  he seemed in a measure changed after departing from the United States in  December, 1918, I do not think that the change was sufficient to justify  the presumption of self-assurance which it would be necessary to adopt  if the alternative possibility is considered to furnish the better  explanation.    It is, however, natural, considering what occurred at Paris, to search  out the reason or reasons for the President's evident unwillingness to  listen to advice when he did not solicit it, and for his failure to take  all the American Commissioners into his confidence. But to attempt to  dissect the mentality and to analyze the intellectual processes of  Woodrow Wilson is not my purpose. It would only invite discussion and  controversy as to the truth of the premises and the accuracy of the  deductions reached.

N.           *       *       *       *       *      _July, 1736_--Reynolds, condemned upon the Black Act, for going armed in  disguise, in pulling down Lothbury turn-pike, with one Baylis,  (reprieved, and transported for 14 years,) was carried to Tyburn, where,  having prayed and sung psalms, he was turned off, and being thought  dead, was cut down by the hangman as usual, who had procured a hole to  be dug at some distance from the gallows, to bury him in; but just as  they had put him into his coffin, and were about to fasten him up, he  thrust back the lid, and to the astonishment of the spectators, placed  his hands on the sides of the coffin in order to raise himself up. Some  of the people, in their first surprise, were for knocking him on the  head; but the executioner insisted upon hanging him up again; when the  mob, thinking otherwise, cried, \"Save his life,\" and fell upon the poor  executioner, (who stickled hard for fulfilling the law,) and beat him in  a miserable manner; they then carried the prisoner to a public-house at  Bayswater, where he was put to bed; he vomited about three pints of  blood, and it was thought he would recover; but he died soon after. The  sheriffs' officers, believing the prisoner dead, had retired from the  place of execution before he was cut down.    _Sept. 3, 1736._--Venham and Harding, two malefactors, were executed  this day at Bristol. After they were cut down, Venham was perceived to  have life in him, when put in the coffin; and some lightermen and  others, having carried him to a house, a surgeon, whom they sent for,  immediately opened a vein, which so far recovered his senses, that he  had the use of speech, sat upright, rubbed his knees, shook hands with  divers persons he knew, and to all appearance a perfect recovery was  expected. But notwithstanding this, he died about eleven o'clock in  great agony, his bowels being very much convulsed, as appeared by his  rolling from one side to the other.    It is remarkable also, that Harding came to life again, and was carried  to Bridewell, and the next day to Newgate, where several people visited  him and gave him money, who were very inquisitive whether he remembered  the manner of his execution; to which he replied, he could only remember  his having been at the gallows, and knew nothing of Venham being with  him.    G. K.           *       *       *       *       *      LOVE AND JOY.    AN ALLEGORY.      In the happy period of the golden age when all the celestial inhabitants  descended upon the earth and conversed familiarly with mortals, among  the most cherished of the heavenly powers were twins, the offspring of  Jupiter, Love, and Joy. Wherever they appeared, flowers sprung up  beneath their feet, the sun shone with a brighter radiance, and all  nature seemed embellished by their presence; they were inseparable  companions, and their growing attachment was favoured by Jupiter, who  had decreed that a lasting union should be solemnized between them as  soon as they arrived at mature years. But in the meantime, the sons of  men deviated from their native innocence; vice and ruin over-ran the  earth with giant strides; and Astrea with her train of celestial  visitants, forsook their polluted abode; Love alone remained, having  been stolen away by Hope, who was his nurse, and conveyed by her to the  forest of Arcadia, where he was brought up amongst the shepherds. But  Jupiter assigned him a different partner, and commanded him to espouse  Sorrow, the daughter of Ate. He complied with reluctance, for her  features were harsh, her eyes sunken, her forehead contracted into  perpetual wrinkles, and her temples encircled with a wreath of cypress  and wormwood. From this union sprung a virgin, in whom might be traced a  strong resemblance to both her parents; but the sullen and unamiable  features of her mother were so blended with the sweetness of the father,  that her countenance, though mournful, was highly pleasing. The maids  and shepherds gathered round and called her Pity. A red-breast was  observed to build in the cabin where she was born; and while she was yet  an infant, a dove, pursued by a hawk, flew for refuge into her bosom.  She had a dejected appearance, but so soft and gentle a mien, that she  was beloved to enthusiasm. Her voice was low and plaintive, but  inexpressibly sweet; and she loved to lie for hours on the banks of some  wild and melancholy stream singing to her lute. She taught men to weep,  for she took a strange delight in tears; and often when the virgins of  the hamlet were assembled at their evening sports, she would steal in  among them and captivate their hearts by her tales of charming sadness.  She wore on her head a garland, composed of her father's myrtles twisted  with her mother's cypress. One day as she sat musing by the waters of  Helicon, her tears by chance fell into the spring; and ever since, the  muses' spring has tasted of the infusion. Pity was commanded by Jupiter  to follow the steps of her mother through the world, dropping balm into  the wounds she made, and binding up the hearts she had broken. She  follows with her hair loose, her bosom bare and throbbing, her garments  torn by the briars, and her feet bleeding with the roughness of the  path. The nymph is mortal, for so is her mother; and when she has  finished her destined course upon earth, they shall both expire  together, and Love be again united to Joy, his immortal and  long-betrothed bride.           *       *       *       *       *        THE CONTEMPORARY TRAVELLER.      ACCOUNT OF THE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS NEAR THE RHINE.    _(From a Correspondent.)_      There is a volcanic country on the left bank between Remagen and  Andernach, highly interesting to the naturalist, but I believe not  visited by the generality of travellers. The late accounts, however, of  the formations of a similar kind in Auvergne and Clermont, in the centre  of France, and the speculations to which these phenomena have given  rise, determined me to explore this district whilst I was in the  neighbourhood. Bidding adieu, therefore, to the green little island of  Nonnenworth, I made the journey to Brohl, a convenient day's walk of  sixteen miles, passing through Oberwinter, Remagen, and Breysig, and the  other white and slated villages that enliven the river. It is here the  valley of the Rhine narrows, and the succession of ridges and dales  which the road skirts, are sometimes entirely barren, at others thickly  covered with vines and fruit-trees. Though the former plant is pleasing  in the tints of its leaf, and in the idea of cultivation and plenty that  its thick plantations present, yet there is a stiffness in the  regularity in which it grows, propped up by sticks; and it is so short,  that one's fancy as to its luxuriance, (especially if formed from such  poetry as _Childe Harold_,) is certainly disappointed. I made a  digression from the road up the little river Aar, which falls into the  Rhine near Sinzig. A more striking picture you cannot imagine. The  stream is remarkably clear and rapid, the bottom rocky, and its banks,  for a considerable distance, are literally perpendicular rocks. The Aar  is a perfect specimen of the mountain torrent; it rises in the Eiffel  mountains; and, I am told, in the winter does much mischief by  inundations. It put me in mind of the Welsh rivulets, particularly some  parts of the Dee. This _detour_ having taken up more time than I  expected, I reached Brohl, late, but in time for the supper at the  rustic Gasthoff, which, with a flask of Rhenish wine, and the company of  an agreeable German tourist who was staying there, made ample amends for  the fatigues of the day.    In setting out from Brohl by the stream of the same name, which runs  down from the Lake of Laach, where I was struck with the pieces of  pumice-stone, and the charred remains of herbs and stalks of trees  scattered over the marshes. I soon came to the valley, the sides of  which are composed of what is called, in the language of geology,  _tufa_, and in that of the country, _dukstein_, or _trass_. It is a  stone, or a hard clay, of a dull blueish colour, and when dry, it  assumes a shade of light gray. An immense quantity is quarried  throughout the valley, and is sent down the Rhine to Holland, where it  is in great request for building. The village of Nippes owes its origin  to the trade in trass, having been founded by a Dutchman, who settled  there about a century ago for the convenience of exportation. The lower  part of the mass is the hardest and most compact, and is therefore  preferred by the quarrymen; as it rises, the upper part becomes loose  and sandy, and unfit for use. You must not suppose the stream to be  clear like the Aar, for it is as thick as pea-soup, and about the same  colour, being in fact a river of trass in solution. The banks, however,  are picturesque and well wooded, particularly at Schweppenbourg, an old  castle of peculiar architecture, built on an elevated rock, and formerly  belonging to the family of Metternich, (God save the mark!) The tower is  surrounded with caverns and halls, hollowed out of the trass stone, and  profusely ornamented with fine oaks, pines, and spreading beech trees.  You may almost fancy yourself on magic ground, and looking on a fairy  castle, so peculiar is the effect. I next reached Burgbrohl and  Wassenach, passing several of the trass mills, for the stone is in many  places hard enough for mill-stones, and there is a considerable trade in  them to Holland, and thence to England and other countries. Half an hour  next brought me to the summit of the Feitsberg, one of the hills forming  the circumference of the lake; here I enjoyed a magnificent prospect on  the one side of the lake, well clothed with wood, with the old  six-towered abbey on its bank, and the heights of the Eiffel chain  enclosing it; on the other side, the "]]]
