[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53526"],[0,"Cardinal Wolsey (#19)"],[1,"a feeble assent  to his request for advice, \"whether they thought it convenient that the  king should pass the sea with an army or not,\" he proceeded, \"Then he  must go like a prince, which cannot be without your aid.\" He unfolded  his proposals for a grant of 3s. 4d. in the pound on £50 and upwards,  2s. 8d. on £20 and upwards, and 1s. in the pound on £1 and upwards. Some  one pleaded that the times were bad. \"Sirs,\" said Wolsey, \"speak not to  break what is concluded, for some shall not pay even a tenth; and it  were better that a few should suffer indigence than the king at this  time should lack. Beware, therefore, and resist not, nor ruffle not in  this case; otherwise it may fortune to cost some their heads.\" This was  indeed a high-handed way of dealing with a public meeting, which was  only summoned to hear the full measure of the coming calamity. We cannot  wonder that \"all people cursed the cardinal and his adherents as  subverters of the laws and liberty of England.\" Nor was Wolsey ignorant  of the unpopularity which he incurred; but there was no escape possible.  He rested only on the king's favour, and he knew that the king's  personal affection for him had grown colder. He was no longer the king's  friend and tutor, inspiring him with his own lofty ideas and slowly  revealing his far-reaching schemes. Late years had seen Wolsey immersed  in the business of the State, while the king pursued his own pleasures,  surrounded by companions who did their utmost to undermine Wolsey's  influence. They advocated war, while he longed for peace; they  encouraged the royal extravagance, while he worked for economy; they  favoured the imperial alliance and humoured Henry's dreams of the  conquest of France, while Wolsey saw that England's strength lay in a  powerful neutrality. The king's plans had deviated from the lines which  Wolsey had designed, and the king's arbitrary temper had grown more  impatient of restraint. Wolsey had imperceptibly slipped from the  position of a friend to that of a servant, and he was dimly conscious  that his continuance in the royal service depended on his continued  usefulness. Whatever the king required he was bound to provide.    So Wolsey strained every nerve to fill the royal coffers by the device  of an \"Amicable Loan,\" which raised a storm of popular indignation. Men  said with truth that they had not yet paid the subsidy voted by  Parliament, and already they were exposed to a new exaction. Coin had  never been plentiful in England, and at that time it was exceptionally  scarce. The commissioners in the different shires all reported the  exceeding difficulty which they met with in the discharge of their  unpleasant duty. It soon became clear to Wolsey that his demand had  overshot the limits of prudence, and that money could not be raised on  the basis of the parliamentary assessment without the risk of a  rebellion. Accordingly Wolsey withdrew from his original proposal. He  sent for the mayor and corporation of London and told them, in the  fictitious language in which constitutional procedure is always veiled,  \"I kneeled down to his Grace, showing him both your good minds towards  him and also the charge you continually sustain, the which, at my desire  and petition, was content to call in and abrogate the same commission.\"  The attempt to raise money on the basis of each man's ratable value was  abandoned, and the more usual method of a benevolence was substituted in  its stead.    This, however, was not much more acceptable. Again Wolsey summoned the  mayor and corporation; but they had now grown bolder, and pleaded that  benevolences had been abolished by the statute of Richard III. Wolsey  angrily answered that Richard was a usurper and a murderer of his  nephews; how could his acts be good? \"An it please your Grace,\" was the  answer, \"although he did evil, yet in his time were many good acts made  not by him only, but by the consent of the body of the whole realm,  which is Parliament.\" There was nothing more to be said, and Wolsey had  to content himself with leaving every man to contribute privily what he  would. It did not seem that this spontaneous liberality went far to  replenish the royal exchequer.    What happened in London was repeated in different forms in various parts  of England. In Norwich there was a tumult, which it needed the presence  of the Duke of Norfolk to appease. He asked the confused assembly who  was their captain, and bade that he should speak. Then out spake one  John Greene, a man of fifty years. \"My lord, since you ask who is our  captain, forsooth, his name is Poverty; for he and his cousin Necessity  have brought us to this doing. For all these persons and many more live  not of ourselves, but we live by the substantial occupiers of this  country; and yet they give us so little wages for our workmanship that  scarcely we be able to live; and thus in penury we pass the time, we,  our wives and children: and if they, by whom we live, be brought in that  case that they of their little cannot help us to earn our living, then  must we perish and die miserably. I speak this, my lord: the clothmakers  have put away all their people, and a far greater number, from work. The  husbandmen have put away their servants and given up household; they say  the king asketh so much that they be not able to do as they have done  before this time, and then of necessity must we die wretchedly.\"    John Greene's speech expressed only too truly the condition of affairs  in a period of social change. The old nobility had declined, and the old  form of life founded on feudalism was slowly passing away. Trade was  becoming more important than agriculture; the growth of wool was more  profitable than the growth of corn. It is true that England as a whole  was growing richer, and that the standard of comfort was rising; but  there was a great displacement of labour, and consequent discontent. The  towns had thriven at the expense of the country; and in late years the  war with France had hindered trade with the Netherlands. The custom  duties had diminished, the drain of bullion for war expenses had  crippled English commerce. There had been a succession of bad seasons,  and every one had begun to diminish his establishment and look more  carefully after his expenditure.    All this was well known to the Duke of Norfolk, and was laid before the  king. The commissions were recalled, pardons were granted to the  rioters, and the loan was allowed to drop. But Wolsey had to bear all  the odium of the unsuccessful attempt, while the king gained all the  popularity of abandoning it. Yet Henry VIII. resented the failure, and  was angry with Wolsey for exposing him to a rebuff. In spite of his  efforts Wolsey was ceasing to be so useful as he had been before, and  Henry began to criticise his minister. Brave and resolute as Wolsey was,  his labours and disappointments began to tell upon him. Since the  failure of the Conference of Calais he had been working not at the  development of a policy which he approved, but at the uncongenial task  of diminishing the dangers of a policy which he disapproved. The effects  of this constant anxiety told upon his health and spirits, and still  more upon his temper. He might be as able and as firm as ever, but he no  longer had the same confidence in himself.    It was perhaps this feeling which led Wolsey to show the king the  extremity of his desire to serve him by undertaking the desperate  endeavour to wring more money from an exhausted people. Wolsey had done  his utmost to satisfy the king; he had accepted without a murmur the  burden of popular hatred which the attempt was sure to bring. There is a  pathos in his words, reported by an unfriendly hand, addressed to the  council: \"Because every man layeth the burden from him, I am content to  take it on me, and to endure the fume and noise of the people, for my  goodwill towards the king, and comfort of you, my lords and other the  king's councillors; but the eternal God knoweth all.\" Nor was it enough  that he submitted to the storm; he wished to give the king a further  proof of his devotion. Though others might withhold their substance, yet  he would not. He offered the king his house at Hampton Court, which he  had built as his favourite retreat, and had adorned to suit his taste.  It was indeed a royal gift, and Henry had no scruple in accepting it.  But the offer seems to show an uneasy desire to draw closer a bond which  had been gradually loosened, and renew an intimacy which was perceptibly  diminishing.    However, in one way Wolsey had a right to feel satisfaction even in his  ill-success. If money was not to be had, war was impossible, and Wolsey  might now pursue his own policy and work for peace. He had to face the  actual facts that England was allied to Charles, who had won a signal  victory over Francis, and had in his hands a mighty hostage in the  person of the King of France. His first object was to discover Charles  V.'s intentions, and prevent him from using his advantage solely for his  own profit. Bishop Tunstal and Sir Richard Wingfield were sent to  Charles with orders to put on a bold face, and find whether Charles  thought of dethroning Francis or releasing him for a ransom. In the  first case, they were to offer military aid from England; in the second,  they were to claim for England a large share in the concessions to be  wrung out of Francis. The English demands were so exorbitant that though  they may have satisfied the fantastic aspirations of Henry, Wolsey must  have known them to be impossible. Under cover of a friendly proposal to  Charles he was really preparing the way for a breach.    Charles on his side was engaged in playing a similar game. In spite of  his success at Pavia he was really helpless. He had no money, and the  captivity of the French king awakened so much alarm in Europe that he  felt compelled to use his advantage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#19)"],[1,"rent!\" said Mr. Carvel, sternly, \"your memory's too good. But  I proved myself a good business man, Jinny; he paid for her in a year.\"    \"You don't mean that you made him pay you for the boat?\" cried Jinny.  \"Why, Pa, I didn't think you were that mean!\"    The two men laughed heartily.    \"I was a heap meaner,\" said her father. \"I made him pay interest.\"    Virginia drew in her breath, and looked at the Colonel in amazement.    \"He's the meanest man I know,\" said Captain Lige. \"He made me pay  interest, and a mint julep.\"    \"Upon my word, Pa,\" said Miss Virginia, soberly, \"I shouldn't have  believed it of you.\"    Just then Jackson, in his white jacket; came to announce that supper was  ready, and they met Ned at the dining-room door, fairly staggering under  a load of roses.    \"Marse Clarence done send 'em in, des picked out'n de hothouse dis  afternoon, Miss Jinny. Jackson, fotch a bowl!\"    \"No,\" said Virginia. She took the flowers from Ned, one by one, and to  the wonderment of Captain Lige and her--father strewed them hither and  thither upon the table until the white cloth was hid by the red flowers.  The Colonel stroked his goatee and nudged Captain Lige.    \"Look-a-there, now,\" said he. \"Any other woman would have spent two  mortal hours stickin' 'em in china.\"    Virginia, having critically surveyed her work, amid exclamations from  Ned and Jackson, had gone around to her place. And there upon her plate  lay a pearl necklace. For an instant she clapped her palms together,  staring at it in bewilderment. And once more the little childish cry of  delight, long sweet to the Colonel's ears, escaped her.    \"Pa,\" she said, \"is it--?\" And there she stopped, for fear that it might  not be. But he nodded encouragingly.    \"Dorothy Carvel's necklace! No, it can't be.\"    \"Yes, honey,\" said the Colonel. \"Your Uncle Daniel sent it, as he  promised. And when you go upstairs, if Easter has done as I told her,  you will see a primrose dress with blue coin-flowers on your bed. Daniel  thought you might like that, too, for a keepsake. Dorothy Manners wore  it in London, when she was a girl.\"    And so Virginia ran and threw her arms about her father's neck, and  kissed him again and again. And lest the Captain feel badly, she laid  his India shawl beside her; and the necklace upon it.    What a joyful supper they had,--just the three of them! And as the fresh  roses filled the room with fragrance, Virginia filled it with youth and  spirits, and Mr. Carvel and the Captain with honest, manly merriment.  And Jackson plied Captain Brent (who was a prime favorite in that house)  with broiled chicken and hot beat biscuits and with waffles, until at  length he lay back in his chair and heaved a sigh of content, lighting a  cigar. And then Virginia, with a little curtsey to both of them, ran off  to dress for the party.    \"Well,\" said Captain Brent, \"I reckon there'll be gay goings-on here  to-night. I wouldn't miss the sight of 'em, Colonel, for all the cargoes  on the Mississippi. Ain't there anything I can do?\"    \"No, thank you, Lige,\" Mr. Carvel answered. \"Do you remember, one  morning some five years ago, when I took in at the store a Yankee named  Hopper? You didn't like him, I believe.\"    Captain Brent jumped, and the ashes of his cigar fell on his coat. He  had forgotten his conversation with Captain Grant.    \"I reckon I do,\" he said dryly.    For a moment he was on the point of telling the affair. Then he  desisted. He could not be sure of Eliphalet from Grant's description. So  he decided to await a better time. Captain Brent was one to make sure of  his channel before going ahead.    \"Well,\" continued the Colonel, \"I have been rather pushed the last week,  and Hopper managed things for this dance. He got the music, and saw the  confectioner. But he made such a close bargain with both of 'em that  they came around to me afterward,\" he added, laughing.    \"Is he coming here to-night?\" demanded the Captain, looking disgusted.    \"Lige,\" replied the Colonel, \"you never do get over a prejudice. Yes,  he's coming, just to oversee things. He seems to have mighty little  pleasure, and he's got the best business head I ever did see. A Yankee,\"  said Mr. Carvel, meditatively, as he put on his hat, \"a Yankee, when he  will work, works like all possessed. Hood don't like him any more than  you do, but he allows Hopper is a natural-born business man. Last month  Samuels got tight, and Wright & Company were going to place the largest  order in years. I called in Hood. 'Go yourself, Colonel,' says he. I I'm  too old to solicit business, Hood,' said I. 'Then there's only one man  to send,' says he, 'young Hopper. He'll get the order, or I'll give up  this place I've had for twenty years.' Hopper 'callated' to get it, and  another small one pitched in. And you'd die laughing, Lige, to hear how  he did it.\"    \"Some slickness, I'll gamble,\" grunted Captain Lige.    \"Well, I reckon 'twas slick,\" said the Colonel, thoughtfully. \"You know  old man Wright hates a solicitor like poison. He has his notions. And  maybe you've noticed signs stuck up all over his store, 'No Solicitors  nor Travelling Men Allowed Here'.\"    The Captain nodded.    \"But Hopper--Hopper walks in, sir, bold as you please, right past the  signs till he comes to the old man's cage. 'I want to see Mr. Wright,'  says he to the clerk. And the clerk begins to grin. 'Name, please,' says  he. Mr. Hopper whips out his business card. 'What!' shouts old Wright,  flying 'round in his chair, 'what the devil does this mean? Can't you  read, sir?' 'callate to,' says Mr. Hopper. 'And you dare to come in  here?    \"'Business is business,' says Hopper. 'You \"callate\"!' bellowed the  old man; 'I reckon you're a damned Yankee. I reckon I'll upset your  \"callations\" for once. And if I catch you in here again, I'll wring your  neck like a roostah's. Git!'\"    \"Who told you this?\" asked Captain Brent.    \"Wright himself,--afterward,\" replied Mr. Carvel, laughing. \"But listen,  Lige. The old man lives at the Planters' House, you know. What does Mr.  Hopper do but go 'round there that very night and give a nigger two bits  to put him at the old man's table. When Wright comes and sees him, he  nearly has one of his apoplectic fits. But in marches Hopper the next  morning with twice the order. The good Lord knows how he did it.\"    There was a silence. Then the door-bell rang.    \"He's dangerous,\" said the Captain, emphatically. \"That's what I call  him.\"    \"The Yankees are changing business in this town,\" was the Colonel's  answer. \"We've got to keep the pace, Lige.\"          CHAPTER XIII. THE PARTY    To gentle Miss Anne Brinsmade, to Puss Russell of the mischievous eyes,  and even to timid Eugenie Renault, the question that burned was: Would  he come, or would he not? And, secondarily, how would Virginia treat him  if he came? Put our friend Stephen for the subjective, and Miss Carvers  party for the objective in the above, and we have the clew. For very  young girls are given to making much out of a very little in such  matters. If Virginia had not gotten angry when she had been teased a  fortnight before, all would have been well.    Even Puss, who walked where angels feared to tread, did not dare to go  too far with Virginia. She had taken care before the day of the party to  beg forgiveness with considerable humility. It had been granted with a  queenly generosity. And after that none of the bevy had dared to broach  the subject to Virginia. Jack Brinsmade had. He told Puss afterward that  when Virginia got through with him, he felt as if he had taken a rapid  trip through the wheel-house of a large steamer. Puss tried, by  various ingenious devices, to learn whether Mr. Brice had accepted his  invitation. She failed.    These things added a zest to a party long looked forward to amongst  Virginia's intimates. In those days young ladies did not \"come out\" so  frankly as they do now. Mothers did not announce to the world that they  possessed marriageable daughters. The world was supposed to know  that. And then the matrimonial market was feverishly active. Young  men proposed as naturally as they now ask a young girl to go for a  walk,--and were refused quite as naturally. An offer of marriage was not  the fearful and wonderful thing--to be dealt with gingerly--which it has  since become. Seventeen was often the age at which they began. And one  of the big Catherwood boys had a habit of laying his heart and hand at  Virginia's feet once a month. Nor did his vanity suffer greatly when she  laughed at him.    It was with a flutter of excitement, therefore, that Miss Carvel's  guests flitted past Jackson, who held the door open obsequiously. The  boldest of them took a rapid survey of the big parlor, before they put  foot on the stairs to see whether Mr. Brice had yet arrived. And if  their curiosity held them too long, they were usually kissed by the  Colonel.    Mr. Carvel shook hands heartily with the young mean and called them by  their first names, for he knew most of their fathers and grandfathers.  And if an older gentleman arrived, perhaps the two might be seen going  down the hall together, arm in arm. So came his beloved enemy, Judge  Whipple, who did not make an excursion to the rear regions of the house  with the Colonel; but they stood and discussed Mr. President Buchanan's  responsibility for the recent panic, until the band, which Mr. Hopper  had stationed under the stairs, drowned their voices.    As we enter the room, there stands Virginia under the rainbowed prisms  of the great chandelier, receiving. But here was suddenly a woman of  twenty-eight, where only this evening we knew a slip of a girl. It was  a trick she had, to become majestic in a ball-gown. She held her head  high, as a woman should, and at her slender throat glowed the pearls of  Dorothy Manners.    The result of all this was to strike a little awe into the souls of many  of her playmates."]]]
