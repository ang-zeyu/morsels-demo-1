The two women came again at the time they said they should, and  found the magician up and dressed, and seated on the sofa; when she  saw them open the door she cried out, 'Oh, the admirable potion! it  has wrought its cure much sooner than you told me it would, and I  have waited a long time with impatience, to desire you to take me  to your charitable mistress to thank her for her kindness, for  which I shall always be obliged to her. Being thus cured as by a  miracle, I had rather not lose time, but continue my journey.'    The two women, who were fairies as well as their mistress, after  they had told the magician how glad they were that she was cured so  soon, walked before her, and conducted her through several  apartments into a large hall, the most richly and magnificently  furnished of all the palace.    Pari Banou was seated in this hall, on a throne of massy gold,  attended on each hand by a great number of beautiful fairies, all  richly dressed. At the sight of so much majesty, the magician was  so dazzled, that after she had prostrated herself before the  throne, she could not open her lips to thank the fairy, as she  proposed. However, Pari Banou saved her the trouble, and said to  her, 'Good woman, I am glad I had the opportunity of obliging you,  and to see you are able to pursue your journey. I will not detain  you, but perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace; follow  my women, and they will show it to you.'    The old sorceress, who had not power nor courage to say a word,  prostrated herself a second time, with her head on the carpet that  covered the foot of the throne, and so took her leave, and was  conducted by the two fairies through all the apartments which were  shown to Prince Ahmed on his first arrival there. But what  surprised her most of all was, that the two fairies told her that  all she saw and admired so much was a mere sketch of their  mistress's grandeur and riches, and that in the extent of her  dominions she had so many palaces that they could not tell the  number of them, all of different architecture, equally magnificent  and superb. They led her at last to the iron gate at which Prince  Ahmed brought her in, and after she had taken her leave of them,  and thanked them for their trouble, they opened it, and wished her  a pleasant journey.    After the magician had gone a little way, she turned back again to  observe the door and know it again, but all in vain, for, as was  before observed, it was invisible to her and all other women.  Except in this, she was very well satisfied with her work, and  posted away to the sultan. When she came to the capital, she went  by a great many by-ways to the private door of the palace. The  sultan being informed of her arrival, sent for her into his  apartment and perceiving a melancholy look on her countenance, he  thought she had not succeeded, and said to her, 'By your looks I  guess that you have not made the discovery I expected from you.'    'Sir,' replied the magician, 'your majesty must give me leave to  represent that you ought not to judge by my looks whether or no I  have acquitted myself well as regards the commands you were pleased  to honour me with. The melancholy you observe proceeds from another  cause than the want of success.'    Then the magician related to the Sultan of the Indies the whole  story of all that happened from beginning to end.    When the magician had ended, she said, 'What does your majesty  think of these unheard-of riches of the fairy? Perhaps you will say  you rejoice at the good fortune of Prince Ahmed your son. For my  part, sir, I beg of your majesty to forgive me if I take the  liberty to say that I think otherwise, and that I shudder when I  consider the misfortunes which may happen to you. And this is the  cause of the melancholy which you perceived. I would believe that  Prince Ahmed, by his own good disposition, is incapable of  undertaking anything against your majesty; but who can say that the  fairy, by the influence she already has over him, may not inspire  him with a dangerous design of dethroning your majesty, and seizing  the crown of the Indies? This is what your majesty ought to  consider serious and of the utmost importance.'    Though the Sultan of the Indies was very sure that Prince Ahmed's  natural disposition was good, yet he could not help being uneasy at  the remarks of the old sorceress, and said, 'I thank you for the  pains you have taken, and your wholesome caution. I am so aware of  the great importance it is to me, that I shall take advice upon  it.'    He had been consulting with his favourites, when he was told of the  magician's arrival. He ordered her to follow him to them. He  acquainted them with what he had learnt, and communicated to them  also the reason he had to fear the fairy's influence over the  prince, and asked them what measures they thought most proper to  prevent so great a misfortune. One of the favourites, taking upon  himself to speak for the rest, said, 'Your majesty knows who must  be the author of this mischief. In order to prevent it, now that he  is in your court, and in your power, you ought not to hesitate to  put him under arrest: I will not say take away his life, for that  would make too much noise; but make him a close prisoner while he  lives.' This advice all the other favourites unanimously applauded.    The magician, who thought it too violent, asked the sultan leave to  speak, which being granted, she said, 'Sir, I am persuaded that the  zeal of your councillors for your majesty's interest makes them  propose arresting Prince Ahmed: but they will not take it amiss if  I suggest to your and their consideration, that if you arrest the  prince, you must also detain his retinue. But they are all genies.  Do they think it will be so easy to surprise, seize, and secure  their persons? Will they not disappear, by the property they  possess of rendering themselves invisible, and transport themselves  instantly to the fairy, and give her an account of the insult  offered to her husband? And can it be supposed she will let it go  unrevenged? But it would be better, if, by any other means which  might not make so great a noise, the sultan could secure himself  against any ill designs Prince Ahmed may have against him, and not  involve his majesty's honour. If his majesty has any confidence in  my advice, as genies and fairies can do things impracticable to  men, he will touch Prince Ahmed's honour, and engage him, by means  of the fairy, to procure certain advantages. For example, every  time your majesty takes the field you are obliged to go to a great  expense, not only in pavilions and tents for yourself and army, but  likewise in mules and camels, and other beasts of burden, to carry  their baggage. Might you not request him to use his interest with  the fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a man's  hand, and which should be large enough to shelter your whole army?    'I need say no more to your majesty. If the prince brings such a  tent, you may make a great many other demands of the same nature,  so that at last he may sink under the difficulties and the  impossibility of executing them, however fertile in invention the  fairy who has enticed him from you by her enchantments may be; so  that in time he will be ashamed to appear, and will be forced to  pass the rest of his life with his fairy, excluded from any  connection with this world; and then your majesty will have nothing  to fear, and cannot be reproached with so detestable an action as  the shedding of a son's blood, or confining him in a prison for  life.'    When the magician had finished her speech, the sultan asked his  favourites if they had anything better to propose; and finding them  all silent, determined to follow the magician's advice, as the most  reasonable and the most suited to his mild manner of government.    The next day, when the prince came into his father's presence and  had sat down by him, after a conversation on different subjects,  the sultan said, 'Son, when you came and dispelled those clouds of  melancholy which your long absence had brought upon me, you made  the place you had chosen for your retreat a mystery to me. I was  satisfied with seeing you again, and knowing that you were content  with your condition, without wishing to penetrate into your secret,  which I found you did not care I should. I know not what reason you  had thus to treat a father. I know your good fortune; I rejoice  with you, and very much approve of your conduct in marrying a fairy  so worthy of your love, and so rich and powerful, as I am informed.  Powerful as I am, it was not possible for me to have procured so  great a match for you. Now that you are raised to so high a rank as  to be envied by everybody but a father like me, I not only desire  you to preserve the good understanding we have lived in hitherto,  but to use all your credit with your fairy to obtain for me her  assistance when I want it. I therefore will make a trial this day.    'I am persuaded you could easily procure from her a pavilion that  might be carried in a man's hand, yet which would extend over my  whole army; especially when you let her know it is for me. Though  it may be a difficult thing, she will not refuse you. All the world  knows that fairies are capable of doing the most extraordinary  things.'    Prince Ahmed never expected that the sultan his father would have  asked a thing which, at first sight, appeared to him so difficult,  not to say impossible. Though he knew not absolutely how great the  power of genies and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#19)"],[1,"the region of primitive motions, women I hold to be especially  capable. Even without equal freedom with the other sex, they have  already shown themselves so; and should these faculties have free  play, I believe they will open new, deeper and purer sources of joyous  inspiration than have as yet refreshed the earth.    Let us be wise, and not impede the soul. Let her work as she will. Let  us have one creative energy, one incessant revelation. Let it take  what form it will, and let us not bind it by the past to man or woman,  black or white. Jove sprang from Rhea, Pallas from Jove. So let it be.    If it has been the tendency of these remarks to call Woman rather to  the Minerva side,--if I, unlike the more generous writer, have spoken  from society no less than the soul,--let it be pardoned! It is love  that has caused this,--love for many incarcerated souls, that might be  freed, could the idea of religious self-dependence be established in  them, could the weakening habit of dependence on others be broken up.    Proclus teaches that every life has, in its sphere, a totality or  wholeness of the animating powers of the other spheres; having only,  as its own characteristic, a predominance of some one power. Thus  Jupiter comprises, within himself, the other twelve powers, which  stand thus: The first triad is _demiurgic or fabricative_, that  is, Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan; the second, _defensive_, Vesta,  Minerva, Mars; the third, _vivific_, Ceres, Juno, Diana; and the  fourth, Mercury, Venus, Apollo, _elevating and harmonic_. In the  sphere of Jupiter, energy is predominant--with Venus, beauty; but each  comprehends and apprehends all the others.    When the same community of life and consciousness of mind begin among  men, humanity will have, positively and finally, subjugated its brute  elements and Titanic childhood; criticism will have perished;  arbitrary limits and ignorant censure be impossible; all will have  entered upon the liberty of law, and the harmony of common growth.    Then Apollo will sing to his lyre what Vulcan forges on the anvil, and  the Muse weave anew the tapestries of Minerva.    It is, therefore, only in the present crisis that the preference is  given to Minerva. The power of continence must establish the  legitimacy of freedom, the power of self-poise the perfection of  motion.    Every relation, every gradation of nature is incalculably precious,  but only to the soul which is poised upon itself, and to whom no loss,  no change, can bring dull discord, for it is in harmony with the  central soul.    If any individual live too much in relations, so that he becomes a  stranger to the resources of his own nature, he falls, after a while,  into a distraction, or imbecility, from which he can only be cured by  a time of isolation, which gives the renovating fountains time to rise  up. With a society it is the same. Many minds, deprived of the  traditionary or instinctive means of passing a cheerful existence,  must find help in self-impulse, or perish. It is therefore that, while  any elevation, in the view of union, is to be hailed with joy, we  shall not decline celibacy as the great fact of the time. It is one  from which no vow, no arrangement, can at present save a thinking  mind. For now the rowers are pausing on their oars; they wait a change  before they can pull together. All tends to illustrate the thought of  a wise cotemporary. Union is only possible to those who are units. To  be fit for relations in time, souls, whether of Man or Woman, must be  able to do without them in the spirit.    It is therefore that I would have Woman lay aside all thought, such as  she habitually cherishes, of being taught and led by men. I would have  her, like the Indian girl, dedicate herself to the Sun, the Sun of  Truth, and go nowhere if his beams did not make clear the path. I  would have her free from compromise, from complaisance, from  helplessness, because I would have her good enough and strong enough  to love one and all beings, from the fulness, not the poverty of  being.    Men, as at present instructed, will not help this work, because they  also are under the slavery of habit. I have seen with delight their  poetic impulses. A sister is the fairest ideal, and how nobly  Wordsworth, and even Byron, have written of a sister!    There is no sweeter sight than to see a father with his little  daughter. Very vulgar men become refined to the eye when leading a  little girl by the hand. At that moment, the right relation between  the sexes seems established, and you feel as if the man would aid in  the noblest purpose, if you ask him in behalf of his little daughter.  Once, two fine figures stood before me, thus. The father of very  intellectual aspect, his falcon eye softened by affection as he looked  down on his fair child; she the image of himself, only more graceful  and brilliant in expression. I was reminded of Southey's Kehama; when,  lo, the dream was rudely broken! They were talking of education, and  he said,    \"I shall not have Maria brought too forward. If she knows too much,  she will never find a husband; superior women hardly ever can.\"    \"Surely,\" said his wife, with a blush, \"you wish Maria to be as good  and wise as she can, whether it will help her to marriage or not.\"    \"No,\" he persisted, \"I want her to have a sphere and a home, and some  one to protect her when I am gone.\"    It was a trifling incident, but made a deep impression. I felt that  the holiest relations fail to instruct the unprepared and perverted  mind. If this man, indeed, could have looked at it on the other side,  he was the last that would have been willing to have been taken  himself for the home and protection he could give, but would have been  much more likely to repeat the tale of Alcibiades with his phials.    But men do _not_ look at both sides, and women must leave off  asking them and being influenced by them, but retire within  themselves, and explore the ground-work of life till they find their  peculiar secret. Then, when they come forth again, renovated and  baptized, they will know how to turn all dross to gold, and will be  rich and free though they live in a hut, tranquil if in a crowd. Then  their sweet singing shall not be from passionate impulse, but the  lyrical overflow of a divine rapture, and a new music shall be evolved  from this many-chorded world.    Grant her, then, for a while, the armor and the javelin. Let her put  from her the press of other minds, and meditate in virgin loneliness.  The same idea shall reappear in due time as Muse, or Ceres, the  all-kindly, patient Earth-Spirit.    Among the throng of symptoms which denote the present tendency to a  crisis in the life of Woman,--which resembles the change from  girlhood, with its beautiful instincts, but unharmonized thoughts, its  blind pupilage and restless seeking, to self-possessed, wise and  graceful womanhood,--I have attempted to select a few.    One of prominent interest is the unison upon the subject of three male  minds, which, for width of culture, power of self-concentration and  dignity of aim, take rank as the prophets of the coming age, while  their histories and labors are rooted in the past.    Swedenborg came, he tells us, to interpret the past revelation and  unfold a new. He announces the New Church that is to prepare the way  for the New Jerusalem, a city built of precious stones, hardened and  purified by secret processes in the veins of earth through the ages.    Swedenborg approximated to that harmony between the scientific and  poetic lives of mind, which we hope from the perfected man. The links  that bind together the realms of nature, the mysteries that accompany  her births and growths, were unusually plain to him. He seems a man to  whom insight was given at a period when the mental frame was  sufficiently matured to retain and express its gifts.    His views of Woman are, in the main, satisfactory. In some details we  my object to them, as, in all his system, there are still remains of  what is arbitrary and seemingly groundless--fancies that show the  marks of old habits, and a nature as yet not thoroughly leavened with  the spiritual leaven. At least, so it seems to me now. I speak  reverently, for I find such reason to venerate Swedenborg, from an  imperfect knowledge of his mind, that I feel one more perfect might  explain to me much that does not now secure my sympathy.    His idea of Woman is sufficiently large and noble to interpose no  obstacle to her progress. His idea of marriage is consequently  sufficient. Man and Woman share an angelic ministry; the union is of  one with one, permanent and pure.    As the New Church extends its ranks, the needs of Woman must be more  considered.    Quakerism also establishes Woman on a sufficient equality with Man.  But, though the original thought of Quakerism is pure, its scope is  too narrow, and its influence, having established a certain amount of  good and made clear some truth, must, by degrees, be merged in one of  wider range. [Footnote: In worship at stated periods, in daily  expression, whether by word or deed, the Quakers have placed Woman on  the same platform with Man. Can any one assert that they have reason  to repent this?] The mind of Swedenborg appeals to the various nature  of Man, and allows room for aesthetic culture and the free expression  of energy.    As apostle of the new order, of the social fabric that is to rise from  love, and supersede the old that was based on strife, Charles Fourier  comes next, expressing, in an outward order, many facts of which  Swedenborg saw the secret springs. The mind of Fourier, though grand  and clear, was, in some respects, superficial. He was a stranger to  the highest experiences. His eye was fixed on the outward more than  the inward needs of Man. Yet he, too, was a seer of the divine order,  in its musical expression, if not in its poetic soul. He has filled"]]]
