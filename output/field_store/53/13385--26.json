   19:094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the             workers of iniquity boast themselves?    19:094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine             heritage.    19:094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the             fatherless.    19:094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of             Jacob regard it.    19:094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when             will ye be wise?    19:094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the             eye, shall he not see?    19:094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that             teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?    19:094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.    19:094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest             him out of thy law;    19:094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,             until the pit be digged for the wicked.    19:094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he             forsake his inheritance.    19:094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the             upright in heart shall follow it.    19:094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will             stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?    19:094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in             silence.    19:094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.    19:094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight             my soul.    19:094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which             frameth mischief by a law?    19:094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the             righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.    19:094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my             refuge.    19:094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut             them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall             cut them off.    19:095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise             to the rock of our salvation.    19:095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a             joyful noise unto him with psalms.    19:095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.    19:095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of             the hills is his also.    19:095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry             land.    19:095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the             LORD our maker.    19:095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and             the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,    19:095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the             day of temptation in the wilderness:    19:095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.    19:095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,             It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not             known my ways:    19:095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into             my rest.    19:096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the             earth.    19:096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation             from day to day.    19:096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all             people.    19:096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be             feared above all gods.    19:096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made             the heavens.    19:096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in             his sanctuary.    19:096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the             LORD glory and strength.    19:096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an             offering, and come into his courts.    19:096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,             all the earth.    19:096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also             shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall             judge the people righteously.    19:096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the             sea roar, and the fulness thereof.    19:096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall             all the trees of the wood rejoice    19:096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the             earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the             people with his truth.    19:097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of             isles be glad thereof.    19:097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and             judgment are the habitation of his throne.    19:097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round             about.    19:097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and             trembled.    19:097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the             presence of the Lord of the whole earth.    19:097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see             his glory.    19:097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast             themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.    19:097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced             because of thy judgments, O LORD.    19:097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted             far above all gods.    19:097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of             his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.    19:097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright             in heart.    19:097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the             remembrance of his holiness.    19:098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous             things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the             victory.    19:098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath             he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.    19:098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of             Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of             our God.    19:098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud           "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#19)"],[1,"\"cram.\"                Yet my classic lore aggressive                (If you'll pardon the possessive)                Is exceedingly impressive                      When you're passing an exam.

Be sure you never let him sit up late                In chilly open air conversing          Poor darling, he's extremely delicate,                And wants a deal of nursing!      LUD.

To contradict a character so rich                In trusting love were simple blindness          He's one of those exalted natures which                Will only yield to kindness!      LUD.

Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words    with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?          JULIA.  Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to    play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come    to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.    Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand    Duchess.          LUD.  Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll    make    a very fine part of it.          JULIA.  Why, that's quite my idea.          LUD.  I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish    viragoes.          JULIA.  You think not?          LUD.  Oh, I'm quite clear about that.  I should make her a    tender, gentle, submissive, affectionate (but not too    affectionate) child-wifetimidly anxious to coil herself into    her husband's heart, but kept in check by an awestruck reverence    for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal    appearance.          JULIA.  Oh, that is your idea of a good part?          LUD.  Yesa wife who regards her husband's slightest wish    as an inflexible law, and who ventures but rarely into his august    presence, unless (which would happen seldom) he should summon her    to appear before him.  A crushed, despairing violet, whose    blighted existence would culminate (all too soon) in a lonely and    pathetic death-scene!  A fine part, my dear.          JULIA.  Yes.  There's a good deal to be said for your view    of it.  Now there are some actresses whom it would fit like a    glove.          LUD.  (aside).  I wish I'd married one of 'em!          JULIA.  But, you see, I must consider my temperament. For    instance, my temperament would demand some strong scenes of    justifiable jealousy.          LUD.  Oh, there's no difficulty about that.  You shall have    them.          JULIA.  With a lovely but detested rival          LUD.  Oh, I'll provide the rival.          JULIA.  Whom I should stabstabstab!          LUD.  Oh, I wouldn't stab her.  It's been done to death.  I    should treat her with a silent and contemptuous disdain, and    delicately withdraw from a position which, to one of your    sensitive nature, would be absolutely untenable.  Dear me, I can    see you delicately withdrawing, up centre and off!          JULIA.  Can you?          LUD.  Yes.

Well, let us see your notion                      Of a first-rate part.      JULIA (dramatically).          I have a rival!  Frenzy-thrilled,                I find you both together!          My heart stands stillwith horror chilled-                Hard as the millstone nether!          Then softly, slyly, snaily, snaky          Crawly, creepy, quaily, quaky                I track her on her homeward way,                As panther tracks her fated prey!      (Furiously.)      I fly at her soft white throat                The lily-white laughing leman!          On her agonized gaze I gloat                With the glee of a dancing demon!          My rival sheI have no doubt of her-          So I hold ontill the breath is out of her!                      till the breath is out of her!            And thenRemorse! Remorse!          O cold unpleasant corse,                      Avaunt! Avaunt!                That lifeless form                      I gaze upon                That face, still warm                      But weirdly wan                Those eyes of glass                      I contemplate                And then, alas!                      Too latetoo late!                I find she isyour Aunt!    (Shuddering.)     Remorse!  Remorse!            Then, madmadmad!                With fancies wildchimerical          Now sorrowfulsilentsad                Now hullaballoo hysterical!                      Ha! ha! ha! ha!          But whether I'm sad or whether I'm glad,                Mad! mad! mad! mad!            This calls for the resources of a high-class art,          And satisfies my notion of a first-rate part!

With rage and indignation she is rife,                Because our welcome wasn't very hearty                      She's as sulky as a super,                      And she's swearing like a trooper,          O, you never heard such language in your life!      Enter BARONESS VON KRAKENFELDT, in a fury.      BAR.  With fury indescribable I burn!                With rage I'm nearly ready to explode!          There'll be grief and tribulation when I learn                To whom this slight unbearable is owed!                      For whatever may be due I'll pay it double                      There'll be terror indescribable and trouble!                      With a hurly-burly and a hubble-bubble                I'll pay you for this pretty episode!      ALL.        Oh, whatever may be due she'll pay it double!                It's very good of her to take the trouble                But we don't know what she means by \"hubble-bubble\"          No doubt it's an expression  la mode.      BAR. (to LUDWIG).                Do you know who I am?      LUD. (examining her).                     I don't;                Your countenance I can't fix, my dear.      BAR.  This proves I'm not a sham.                (Showing pocket-handkerchief.)      LUD. (examining it).                      It won't;          It only says \"Krakenfeldt, Six,\" my dear.      BAR.  Express your grief profound!      LUD.                                      I shan't!                This tone I never allow, my love.      BAR.  Rudolph at once produce!      LUD.                                      I can't;                He isn't at home just now, my love.      BAR. (astonished).      He isn't at home just now!      ALL.        He isn't at home just now,    (Dancing"]]]
