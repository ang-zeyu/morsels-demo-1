Neither is it a well meant kindness  to the youth himself, seeing that fifty opportunities of hanging him may  occur, without his being found in so happy a state of preparation as he  was before your ill advised interference.\"    \"If my young countryman,\" said the Scot, smiling, \"be of opinion I have  done him an injury, I will return him to your charge without a word more  dispute.\"    \"No, no!--for the love of Heaven, no!\" exclaimed Quentin. \"I would  rather you swept my head off with your long sword--it would better  become my birth, than to die by the hands of such a foul churl.\"    \"Hear how he revileth,\" said the finisher of the law. \"Alas! how soon  our best resolutions pass away!--he was in a blessed frame for departure  but now, and in two minutes he has become a contemner of authorities.\"    \"Tell me at once,\" said the Archer, \"what has this young man done.\"    \"Interfered,\" answered Trois Eschelles, with some earnestness, \"to take  down the dead body of a criminal, when the fleur de lys was marked on  the tree where he was hung with my own proper hand.\"    \"How is this, young man?\" said the Archer; \"how came you to have  committed such an offence?\"    \"As I desire your protection,\" answered Durward, \"I will tell you the  truth as if I were at confession. I saw a man struggling on the tree,  and I went to cut him down out of mere humanity. I thought neither of  fleur de lys nor of clove gilliflower, and had no more idea of offending  the King of France than our Father the Pope.\"    \"What a murrain had you to do with the dead body, then?\" said the  Archer. \"You 'll see them hanging, in the rear of this gentleman, like  grapes on every tree, and you will have enough to do in this country  if you go a-gleaning after the hangman. However, I will not quit a  countryman's cause if I can help it.--Hark ye, Master Marshals man, you  see this is entirely a mistake. You should have some compassion on so  young a traveller. In our country at home he has not been accustomed to  see such active proceedings as yours and your master's.\"    \"Not for want of need of them, Signior Archer,\" said Petit Andre, who  returned at this moment. \"Stand fast, Trois Eschelles, for here comes  the Provost Marshal; we shall presently see how he will relish having  his work taken out of his hand before it is finished.\"    \"And in good time,\" said the Archer, \"here come some of my comrades.\"    Accordingly, as the Provost Tristan rode up with his patrol on one side  of the little bill which was the scene of the altercation, four or five  Scottish Archers came as hastily up on the other, and at their head the  Balafre himself.    Upon this urgency, Lesly showed none of that indifference towards his  nephew of which Quentin had in his heart accused him; for he no sooner  saw his comrade and Durward standing upon their defence, than he  exclaimed, \"Cunningham, I thank thee.--Gentlemen--comrades,  lend me your aid.--It is a young Scottish gentleman--my  nephew--Lindesay--Guthrie--Tyrie, draw, and strike in!\"    There was now every prospect of a desperate scuffle between the parties,  who were not so disproportioned in numbers but that the better arms of  the Scottish cavaliers gave them an equal chance of victory. But the  Provost Marshal, either doubting the issue of the conflict, or aware  that it would be disagreeable to the King, made a sign to his followers  to forbear from violence, while he demanded of Balafre, who now put  himself forward as the head of the other party, what he, a cavalier of  the King's Bodyguard, purposed by opposing the execution of a criminal.    \"I deny that I do so,\" answered the Balafre. \"Saint Martin! [patron  saint of Tours, Lucca, and of penitent drunkards. He was greatly  honoured in the Middle Ages.] there is, I think, some difference between  the execution of a criminal and a slaughter of my own nephew!\"    \"Your nephew may be a criminal as well as another,\" said the Provost  Marshal; \"and every stranger in France is amenable to the laws of  France.\"    \"Yes, but we have privileges, we Scottish Archers,\" said Balafre, \"have  we not, comrades?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" they all exclaimed together. \"Privileges--privileges! Long  live King Louis--long live the bold Balafre--long live the Scottish  Guard--and death to all who would infringe our privileges!\"    \"Take reason with you, gentlemen cavaliers,\" said the Provost Marshal;  \"consider my commission.\"    \"We will have no reason at your hand,\" said Cunningham; \"our own  officers shall do us reason. We will be judged by the King's grace,  or by our own Captain, now that the Lord High Constable is not in  presence.\"    \"And we will be hanged by none,\" said Lindesay, \"but Sandie Wilson, the  auld Marshals man of our ain body.\"    \"It would be a positive cheating of Sandie, who is as honest a man as  ever tied noose upon hemp, did we give way to any other proceeding,\"  said the Balafre. \"Were I to be hanged myself, no other should tie  tippet about my craig.\"    \"But hear ye,\" said the Provost Marshal, \"this young fellow belongs not  to you, and cannot share what you call your privileges.\"    \"What we call our privileges, all shall admit to be such,\" said  Cunningham.    \"We will not hear them questioned!\" was the universal cry of the  Archers.    \"Ye are mad, my masters,\" said Tristan l'Hermite. \"No one disputes your  privileges; but this youth is not one of you.\"    \"He is my nephew,\" said the Balafre, with a triumphant air.    \"But no Archer of the Guard, I think,\" retorted Tristan l'Hermite.    The Archers looked on each other in some uncertainty.    \"Stand to it yet, comrade,\" whispered Cunningham to Balafre. \"Say he is  engaged with us.\"    \"Saint Martin! you say well, fair countryman,\" answered Lesly; and  raising his voice, swore that he had that day enrolled his kinsman as  one of his own retinue. This declaration was a decisive argument.    \"It is well, gentlemen,\" said the Provost Tristan, who was aware of  the King's nervous apprehension of disaffection creeping in among his  Guards. \"You know, as you say, your privileges, and it is not my duty to  have brawls with the King's Guards, if it is to be avoided. But I will  report this matter for the King's own decision; and I would have you  to be aware, that, in doing so, I act more mildly than perhaps my duty  warrants.\"    So saying, he put his troop into motion, while the Archers, remaining on  the spot, held a hasty consultation what was next to be done. \"We must  report the matter to Lord Crawford, our Captain, in the first place, and  have the young fellow's name put on the roll.\"    \"But, gentlemen, and my worthy friends and preservers,\" said Quentin,  with some hesitation, \"I have not yet determined whether to take service  with you or no.\"    \"Then settle in your own mind,\" said his uncle, \"whether you choose to  do so, or be hanged--for I promise you, that, nephew of mine as you are,  I see no other chance of your 'scaping the gallows.\"    This was an unanswerable argument, and reduced Quentin at once to  acquiesce in what he might have otherwise considered as no very  agreeable proposal; but the recent escape from the halter, which had  been actually around his neck, would probably have reconciled him to a  worse alternative than was proposed.    \"He must go home with us to our caserne,\" said Cunningham; \"there is  no safety for him out of our bounds, whilst these man hunters are  prowling.\"    \"May I not then abide for this night at the hostelry where I  breakfasted, fair uncle?\" said the youth--thinking, perhaps, like many a  new recruit, that even a single night of freedom was something gained.    \"Yes, fair nephew,\" answered his uncle, ironically, \"that we may have  the pleasure of fishing you out of some canal or moat, or perhaps out  of a loop of the Loire, knit up in a sack for the greater convenience  of swimming--for that is like to be the end on't. The Provost Marshal  smiled on us when we parted,\" continued he, addressing Cunningham, \"and  that is a sign his thoughts were dangerous.\"    \"I care not for his danger,\" said Cunningham; \"such game as we are  beyond his bird bolts. But I would have thee tell the whole to the  Devil's Oliver [Oliver Dain: Oliver's name, or nickname, was Le Diable,  which was bestowed on him by public hatred, in exchange for Le Daim, or  Le Dain. He was originally the King's barber, but afterwards a favourite  counsellor. S.], who is always a good friend to the Scottish Guard, and  will see Father Louis before the Provost can, for he is to shave him  tomorrow.\"    \"But hark you,\" said Balafre, \"it is ill going to Oliver empty handed,  and I am as bare as the birch in December.\"    \"So are we all,\" said Cunningham. \"Oliver must not scruple to take our  Scottish words for once. We will make up something handsome among us  against the next payday; and if he expects to share, let me tell you,  the payday will come about all the sooner.\"    \"And now for the Chateau,\" said Balafre; \"and my nephew shall tell us by  the way how he brought the Provost Marshal on his shoulders, that we may  know how to frame our report both to Crawford and Oliver.\"        CHAPTER VII: THE ENROLMENT         Justice of Peace.--       Here, hand me down the statute--read the articles--       Swear, kiss the book--subscribe, and be a hero;       Drawing a portion from the public stock       For deeds of valour to be done hereafter--       Sixpence per day, subsistence and arrears.         THE RECRUITING OFFICER      An attendant upon the Archers having been dismounted, Quentin Durward  was accommodated with his horse, and, in company of his martial  countrymen, rode at a round pace towards the Castle of Plessis, about  to become, although on his own part involuntarily, an inhabitant of that  gloomy fortress, the outside of which had, that morning, struck him with  so much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#19)"],[1,"e, thou speakest sweetly, with proper accent and emphasis; and  we are well-pleased with thy speech. Thou speakest even as thy father. Thy  sire was ever ready to please us. Tell us now the story as thy father had  related it.\"    Sauti said, \"O thou that art blest with longevity, I shall narrate the  history of Astika as I heard it from my father. O Brahmana, in the golden  age, Prajapati had two daughters. O sinless one, the sisters were endowed  with wonderful beauty. Named Kadru and Vinata, they became the wives of  Kasyapa. Kasyapa derived great pleasure from his two wedded wives and  being gratified he, resembling Prajapati himself, offered to give each of  them a boon. Hearing that their lord was willing to confer on them their  choice blessings, those excellent ladies felt transports of joy. Kadru  wished to have for sons a thousand snakes all of equal splendour. And  Vinata wished to bring forth two sons surpassing the thousand offsprings  of Kadru in strength, energy, size of body, and prowess. Unto Kadru her  lord gave that boon about a multitude of offspring. And unto Vinata also,  Kasyapa said, 'Be it so!' Then Vinata, having obtained her prayer,  rejoiced greatly. Obtaining two sons of superior prowess, she regarded her  boon fulfilled. Kadru also obtained her thousand sons of equal splendour.  'Bear the embryos carefully,' said Kasyapa, and then he went into the  forest, leaving his two wives pleased with his blessings.\"    Sauti continued, \"O best of regenerate ones, after a long time, Kadru  brought forth a thousand eggs, and Vinata two. Their maid-servants  deposited the eggs separately in warm vessels. Five hundred years passed  away, and the thousand eggs produced by Kadru burst and out came the  progeny. But the twins of Vinata did not appear. Vinata was jealous, and  therefore she broke one of the eggs and found in it an embryo with the  upper part developed but the lower one undeveloped. At this, the child in  the egg became angry and cursed his mother, saying. 'Since thou hast  prematurely broken this egg, thou shall serve as a slave. Shouldst thou  wait five hundred years and not destroy, or render the other egg half-  developed, by breaking it through impatience, then the illustrious child  within it will deliver thee from slavery! And if thou wouldst have the  child strong, thou must take tender care of the egg for all this time!'  Thus cursing his mother, the child rose to the sky. O Brahmana, even he is  the charioteer of Surya, always seen in the hour of morning!    \"Then at the expiration of the five hundred years, bursting open the other  egg, out came Garuda, the serpent-eater. O tiger of Bhrigu's race,  immediately on seeing the light, that son of Vinata left his mother. And  the lord of birds, feeling hungry, took wing in quest of the food assigned  to him by the Great Ordainer of all.\".    So ends the sixteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XVII    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"O ascetic, about this time the two sisters saw approaching  near, that steed of complacent appearance named Uchchaihsravas who was  worshipped by the gods, that gem of steeds, who arose at the churning of  the Ocean for nectar. Divine, graceful, perpetually young, creation's  master-piece, and of irresistible vigour, it was blest with every  auspicious mark.\"    Saunaka asked, \"Why did the gods churn the Ocean for nectar, and under  what circumstances and when as you say, did that best of steeds so  powerful and resplendent spring?\"    Sauti said, \"There is a mountain named Meru, of blazing appearance, and  looking like a heap of effulgence. The rays of the Sun falling on its  peaks of golden lustre are dispersed by them. Decked with gold and  exceedingly beautiful, that mountain is the haunt of the gods and the  Gandharvas. It is immeasurable and unapproachable by men of manifold sins.  Dreadful beasts of prey wander over its breasts, and it is illuminated by  many divine life-giving herbs. It stands kissing the heavens by its height  and is the first of mountains. Ordinary people cannot even think of  ascending it. It is graced with trees and streams, and resounds with the  charming melody of winged choirs. Once the celestials sat on its begemmed  peak in conclave. They who had practised penances and observed excellent  vows for amrita now seemed to be eager seekers after amrita (celestial  ambrosia). Seeing the celestial assembly in anxious mood Narayana said to  Brahman, 'Do thou churn the Ocean with the gods and the Asuras. By doing  so, amrita will be obtained as also all drugs and gems. O ye gods, churn  the Ocean, ye will discover amrita.'\"    So ends the seventeenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XVIII    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"There is a mountain called Mandara adorned with cloud-like  peaks. It is the best of mountains, and is covered all over with  intertwining herbs. There countless birds pour forth their melodies, and  beasts of prey roam about. The gods, the Apsaras and the Kinnaras visit  the place. Upwards it rises eleven thousand yojanas, and descends  downwards as much. The gods wanted to tear it up and use it as a churning  rod but failing to do so came to Vishnu and Brahman who were sitting  together, and said unto them, 'Devise some efficient scheme, consider, ye  gods, how Mandara may be dislodged for our good.'\"    Sauti continued, \"O son of Bhrigu! Vishnu with Brahman assented to it.  And the lotus-eyed one (Vishnu) laid the hard task on the mighty Ananta,  the prince of snakes. The powerful Ananta, directed thereto both by  Brahman and Narayana, O Brahmana, tore up the mountain with the woods  thereon and with the denizens of those woods. And the gods came to the  shore of the Ocean with Ananta and addressed the Ocean, saying, 'O Ocean,  we have come to churn thy waters for obtaining nectar.' And the Ocean  replied, 'Be it so, as I shall not go without a share of it. I am able to  bear the prodigious agitation of my waters set up by the mountain.' The  gods then went to the king of tortoises and said to him, 'O Tortoise-king,  thou wilt have to hold the mountain on thy back!' The Tortoise-king agreed,  and Indra contrived to place the mountain on the former's back.    \"And the gods and the Asuras made of Mandara a churning staff and Vasuki  the cord, and set about churning the deep for amrita. The Asuras held  Vasuki by the hood and the gods held him by the tail. And Ananta, who was  on the side of the gods, at intervals raised the snake's hood and suddenly  lowered it. And in consequence of the stretch Vasuki received at the hands  of the gods and the Asuras, black vapours with flames issued from his  mouth. These, turned into clouds charged with lightning, poured showers  that refreshed the tired gods. And flowers that also fell on all sides of  the celestials from the trees on the whirling Mandara, refreshed them.    \"Then, O Brahmana, out of the deep came a tremendous roar like unto the  roar of the clouds at the Universal Dissolution. Diverse aquatic animals  being crushed by the great mountain gave up the ghost in the salt waters.  And many denizens of the lower regions and the world of Varuna were killed.  Large trees with birds on the whirling Mandara were torn up by the roots  and fell into the water. The mutual friction of those trees also produced  fires that blazed up frequently. The mountain thus looked like a mass of  dark clouds charged with lightning. O Brahmana, the fire spread, and  consumed the lions, elephants and other creatures that were on the  mountain. Then Indra extinguished that fire by pouring down heavy showers.    \"After the churning, O Brahmana, had gone on for some time, gummy  exudations of various trees and herbs vested with the properties of amrita  mingled with the waters of the Ocean. And the celestials attained to  immortality by drinking of the water mixed with those gums and with the  liquid extract of gold. By degrees, the milky water of the agitated deep  turned into clarified butter by virtue of those gums and juices. But  nectar did not appear even then. The gods came before the boon-granting  Brahman seated on his seat and said, 'Sire, we are spent up, we have no  strength left to churn further. Nectar hath not yet arisen so that now we  have no resource save Narayana.'    \"On hearing them, Brahman said to Narayana, 'O Lord, condescend to grant  the gods strength to churn the deep afresh.'    \"Then Narayana agreeing to grant their various prayers, said, 'Ye wise  ones, I grant you sufficient strength. Go, put the mountain in position  again and churn the water.'    \"Re-established thus in strength, the gods recommenced churning. After a  while, the mild Moon of a thousand rays emerged from the Ocean. Thereafter  sprung forth Lakshmi dressed in white, then Soma, then the White Steed,  and then the celestial gem Kaustubha which graces the breast of Narayana.  Then Lakshmi, Soma and the Steed, fleet as the mind, all came before the  gods on high. Then arose the divine Dhanwantari himself with the white  vessel of nectar in his hand. And seeing him, the Asuras set up a loud cry,  saying, 'It be ours.'    \"And at length rose the great elephant, Airavata, of huge body and with  two pair of white tusks. And him took Indra the wielder of the thunderbolt.  But with the churning still going on, the poison Kalakuta appeared at last.  Engulfing the Earth it suddenly blazed up like a fire attended with fumes.  And by the scent of the fearful Kalakuta, the three worlds were stupefied.  And then Siva, being solicited by Brahman, swallowed that poison for the  safety of the creation. The divine Maheswara held it in his throat, and it  is said that from that time he is called Nilakantha (blue-throated).  Seeing all these wondrous things, the Asuras were filled with despair, and  got themselves prepared for entering into hostilities with the gods for  the"]]]
