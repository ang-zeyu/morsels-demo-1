They  would have altogether broken into open war, had they not feared that  the Spaniards would return better prepared and in larger number, as  they had left the garrison at La Caldera with that intention. Thus  they let matters stand, neither declaring themselves fully as rebels,  nor observing the laws of friendship toward the men of Tampacan and  other allies of the Spaniards.    Near the island of Mindanao lies an island called Joló, not very large,  but thickly populated with natives, all Mahometans. They number about  three thousand men, and have their own lord and king. When Governor  Francisco de Sande was returning from his expedition to Borneo,  he sent Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa to Joló. He entered  the island and reduced the natives to his Majesty's rule as above  related. The natives were apportioned to Captain Pedro de Osseguera  for his lifetime, and after his death, to his son and successor,  Don Pedro de Osseguera. He asked and collected for several years  what tribute they chose to give him, which was but slight, without  urging more, in order not to make a general disturbance. While Don  Juan Ronquillo was with his camp in Mindanao, the men of Joló, seeing  Spanish affairs flourishing, were willing to enjoy peace and pay their  tribute; but at the departure of the Spaniards, they became lukewarm  again. Captain Juan Pacho, who commanded the presidio of La Caldera  in Don Juan Ronquillo's absence, having sent some soldiers to barter  for wax, the Joloans maltreated them and killed two of them. Juan  Pacho, with the intention of punishing this excess of the Joloans,  went there in person with several boats and thirty soldiers. As he  landed, a considerable body of Joloans descended from their king's  town, which is situated on a high and strongly-fortified hill, and  attacked the Spaniards. Through the number of the natives and the  Spaniards' inability to make use of their arquebuses, on account of  a heavy shower, the latter were routed, and Captain Juan Pacho and  twenty of his followers killed. The rest wounded and in flight took  to their boats and returned to La Caldera.    This event caused great grief in Manila, especially because of the  reputation lost by it, both among the Joloans, and their neighbors,  the people of Mindanao. Although it was considered necessary to punish  the Joloans in order to erase this disgrace, yet as this should be  done signally and just then there was not sufficient preparation,  it was deferred until a better opportunity. Only Captain Villagra was  sent immediately as commander of the presidio of La Caldera, with some  soldiers. Having arrived there, they spent their time in pleasure,  until their provisions were consumed, and the garrison suffering. They  were maintained and supported because of the slight protection that  the people of Tampacan felt, knowing that there were Spaniards on the  island, and hoped for the arrival of more Spaniards, as Don Juan had  promised them, and for punishment and vengeance upon the men of Jolo.    While affairs in the Filipinas were in this condition, ships from  Nueva España arrived at Manila, in the month of May, one thousand five  hundred and ninety-eight. These ships brought despatches ordering the  reëstablishment of the royal Audiencia, which had been suppressed  in the Filipinas some years before. Don Francisco Tello, who was  governing the country, was named and appointed its president; Doctor  Antonio de Morga and Licentiates Christoval Telles Almaçan and Alvaro  Rodriguez Zambrano, auditors; and Licentiate Geronymo de Salazar,  fiscal; and other officials of the Audiencia were also appointed. By  the same ships arrived the archbishop, Fray Ignacio de Sanctivañes,  who enjoyed the archbishopric only for a short time, for he died of  dysentery in, the month of August of the same year. The bishop of  Sebu, Fray Pedro de Agurto came also. On the eighth of May of this  year-five hundred and ninety-eight, the royal seal of the Audiencia  was received. It was taken from the monastery of San Agustin to the  cathedral upon a horse caparisoned with cloth of gold and crimson,  and under a canopy of the same material. The staves of the canopy were  carried by the regidors of the city, who were clad in robes of crimson  velvet lined with white silver cloth, and in breeches and doublets of  the same material. The horse that carried the seal in a box of cloth  of gold covered with brocade was led on the right by him who held  the office of alguacil-mayor, who was clad in cloth of gold and wore  no cloak. Surrounding the horse walked the president and auditors,  all afoot and bareheaded. In front walked a throng of citizens clad  in costly gala dress; behind followed the whole camp and the soldiers,  with their drums and banners, and their arms in hand, and the captains  and officers at their posts, with the master-of-camp preceding them,  staff in hand. The streets and windows were richly adorned with  quantities of tapestry and finery, and many triumphal arches, and  there was music from flutes, trumpets, and other instruments. When  the seal was taken to the door of the cathedral of Manila, the  archbishop in pontifical robes came out with the cross, accompanied  by the chapter and clergy of the church to receive it. Having lifted  the box containing the seal from the horse under the canopy, the  archbishop placed it in the hands of the president. Then the auditors  went into the church with him, while the band of singers intoned  the Te Deum laudamus. They reached the main altar, upon the steps  of which stood a stool covered with brocade. Upon this they placed  the box with the seal. All knelt and the archbishop chanted certain  prayers to the Holy Spirit for the health and good government of the  king, our sovereign. Then the president took the box with the seal,  and with the same order and music with which it had been brought  into the church it was carried out and replaced upon the horse. The  archbishop and clergy remained at the door of the church, while the  cortége proceeded to the royal buildings. The said box containing the  royal seal was placed and left in a beautifully-adorned apartment,  with a covering of cloth of gold and crimson, on a table covered with  brocade and cushions of the same material, which stood under a canopy  of crimson velvet embroidered with the royal arms. Then the royal  order for the establishment of the Audiencia was publicly read there,  and the nominations for president, auditors, and fiscal. Homage was  done them and the usual oath administered. The president proceeded  to the Audiencia hall, where the court rooms were well arranged  and contained a canopy for the royal arms. There the president,  auditors, and fiscal took their seats and received the ministers and  officials of the Audiencia. Then the ordinances of the Audiencia  were read in the presence of as many citizens as could find room  in the hall. This completed the establishment of the Audiencia  on that day. Thenceforth it has exercised its functions, and has  had charge and disposition in all cases, both civil and criminal,  of its district. The latter includes the Filipinas Islands and all  the mainland, of China discovered or to be discovered. In charge of  the president who acts as governor of the land, were all government  affairs according to royal laws, ordinances, and special orders,  which were acted on and brought before the Audiencia.    A few days after the Chancillería of the Filipinas had been established  in Manila, news arrived of events in the kingdom of Camboja after  the arrival of Prauncar--son and successor of Prauncar Langara, who  died in Laos--together with Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz de Hernan  Gonzalez, and of his victories and restoration to the throne, as has  already been related. [The news came] in letters from King Prauncar  to Governor Don Francisco Tello and Doctor Antonio de Morga. They  were signed by the king's hand and seal in red ink. The letters were  written in Castilian so that they might be better understood. Since  they were alike in essence, I thought it proper to reproduce here  the letter written by King Prauncar to Doctor Antonio de Morga,  which reads word for word as follows.    Prauncar, King of Camboja, to Doctor Antonio de Morga, greeting;  to whom I send this letter with great love and joy.    I, Prauncar, King of the rich land of Camboja, I, sole lord of it,  the great, cherish an ardent love for Doctor Antonio de Morga, whom  I am unable to keep from my thoughts, because I have learned through  Captain Chofa Don Blas, the Castilian, that he, from the kindness  of his heart, took an active part and has assisted the governor of  Luzon to send to this country Captain Chofa Don Blas, the Castilian,  and Captain Chofa Don Diego, the Portuguese, with soldiers to find  King Prauncar my father. Having searched for him in vain, the two  chofas and the soldiers killed Anacaparan, who was reigning as sole  great lord. Then they went with their ships to Cochinchina, whence the  two chofas went to Lao, to find the king of this land. They brought  me back to my kingdom, and I am here now through their aid. The two  chofas and other Spaniards who have come, have helped me to pacify  what I now hold. I understand that all this has come to me because the  doctor loves this country. Hence I shall act so that Doctor Antonio  de Morga may always love me as he did my father Prauncar, and assist  me now by sending fathers for the two chofas and the other Spaniards  and Christians who dwell in my kingdom. I shall build them churches  and permit them to christianize whatever Cambodians choose to become  Christians. I shall provide them with servants and I shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary — Complete (#19)"],[1,",--\"what do you mean?--never mind the  ladies.

In troth, says I to him, an that be the  case, Davie, I am misdoubting\"--    \"An almanac! an almanac!\" said Oldbuck, starting up in great alarm--\"not  that bauble!\" flinging away a little pocket almanac which his niece  offered him.--\"Great God! my poor dear Miss Isabella!--Fetch me instantly  the Fairport Almanac.\"--It was brought, consulted, and added greatly to  his agitation. \"I'll go myself--call the gardener and ploughman--bid them  bring ropes and ladders--bid them raise more help as they come along--keep  the top of the cliffs, and halloo down to them--I'll go myself.\"    \"What is the matter?\" inquired Miss Oldbuck and Miss M'Intyre.    \"The tide!--the tide!\" answered the alarmed Antiquary.    \"Had not Jenny better--but no, I'll run myself,\" said the younger lady,  partaking in all her uncle's terrors--\"I'll run myself to Saunders  Mucklebackit, and make him get out his boat.\"    \"Thank you, my dear, that's the wisest word that has been spoken  yet--Run! run!--To go by the sands!\" seizing his hat and cane; \"was there  ever such madness heard of!\"          CHAPTER SEVENTH.                           --Pleased awhile to view                 The watery waste, the prospect wild and new;                 The now receding waters gave them space,                 On either side, the growing shores to trace                 And then returning, they contract the scene,                 Till small and smaller grows the walk between.                                              Crabbe.    The information of Davie Dibble, which had spread such general alarm at  Monkbarns, proved to be strictly correct. Sir Arthur and his  daughter had set out, according to their first proposal, to return to  Knockwinnock by the turnpike road; but when they reached the head of the  loaning, as it was called, or great lane, which on one side made a sort  of avenue to the house of Monkbarns, they discerned, a little way  before them, Lovel, who seemed to linger on the way as if to give him  an opportunity to join them. Miss Wardour immediately proposed to her  father that they should take another direction; and, as the weather  was fine, walk home by the sands, which, stretching below a picturesque  ridge of rocks, afforded at almost all times a pleasanter passage  between Knockwinnock and Monkbarns than the high-road.    [Illustration: Sir Arthur and Miss Wardour]    Sir Arthur acquiesced willingly. \"It would be unpleasant,\" he said, \"to  be joined by that young fellow, whom Mr. Oldbuck had taken the freedom  to introduce them to.\" And his old-fashioned politeness had none of the  ease of the present day which permits you, if you have a mind, to cut  the person you have associated with for a week, the instant you feel or  suppose yourself in a situation which makes it disagreeable to own him.  Sir Arthur only stipulated, that a little ragged boy, for the guerdon  of one penny sterling, should run to meet his coachman, and turn his  equipage back to Knockwinnock.    When this was arranged, and the emissary despatched, the knight and his  daughter left the high-road, and following a wandering path among sandy  hillocks, partly grown over with furze and the long grass called bent,  soon attained the side of the ocean. The tide was by no means so far out  as they had computed but this gave them no alarm;--there were seldom ten  days in the year when it approached so near the cliffs as not to leave a  dry passage. But, nevertheless, at periods of spring-tide, or even  when the ordinary flood was accelerated by high winds, this road was  altogether covered by the sea; and tradition had recorded several fatal  accidents which had happened on such occasions. Still, such dangers  were considered as remote and improbable; and rather served, with other  legends, to amuse the hamlet fireside, than to prevent any one from  going between Knockwinnock and Monkbarns by the sands.    As Sir Arthur and Miss Wardour paced along, enjoying the pleasant  footing afforded by the cool moist hard sand, Miss Wardour could not  help observing that the last tide had risen considerably above the  usual water-mark. Sir Arthur made the same observation, but without its  occurring to either of them to be alarmed at the circumstance. The sun  was now resting his huge disk upon the edge of the level ocean,  and gilded the accumulation of towering clouds through which he had  travelled the livelong day, and which now assembled on all sides, like  misfortunes and disasters around a sinking empire and falling monarch.  Still, however, his dying splendour gave a sombre magnificence to the  massive congregation of vapours, forming out of their unsubstantial  gloom the show of pyramids and towers, some touched with gold, some with  purple, some with a hue of deep and dark red. The distant sea, stretched  beneath this varied and gorgeous canopy, lay almost portentously still,  reflecting back the dazzling and level beams of the descending luminary,  and the splendid colouring of the clouds amidst which he was setting.  Nearer to the beach the tide rippled onward in waves of sparkling  silver, that imperceptibly, yet rapidly, gained upon the sand.    With a mind employed in admiration of the romantic scene, or perhaps  on some more agitating topic, Miss Wardour advanced in silence by her  father's side, whose recently offended dignity did not stoop to open  any conversation. Following the windings of the beach, they passed  one projecting point of headland or rock after another, and now found  themselves under a huge and continued extent of the precipices by which  that iron-bound coast is in most places defended. Long projecting reefs  of rock, extending under water and only evincing their existence by here  and there a peak entirely bare, or by the breakers which foamed over  those that were partially covered, rendered Knockwinnock bay dreaded by  pilots and ship-masters. The crags which rose between the beach and the  mainland, to the height of two or three hundred feet, afforded in  their crevices shelter for unnumbered sea-fowl, in situations seemingly  secured by their dizzy height from the rapacity of man. Many of these  wild tribes, with the instinct which sends them to seek the land before  a storm arises, were now winging towards their nests with the shrill and  dissonant clang which announces disquietude and fear. The disk of the  sun became almost totally obscured ere he had altogether sunk below the  horizon, and an early and lurid shade of darkness blotted the serene  twilight of a summer evening. The wind began next to arise; but its  wild and moaning sound was heard for some time, and its effects became  visible on the bosom of the sea, before the gale was felt on shore. The  mass of waters, now dark and threatening, began to lift itself in larger  ridges, and sink in deeper furrows, forming waves that rose high in  foam upon the breakers, or burst upon the beach with a sound resembling  distant thunder.    Appalled by this sudden change of weather, Miss Wardour drew close to  her father, and held his arm fast. \"I wish,\" at length she said,  but almost in a whisper, as if ashamed to express her increasing  apprehensions, \"I wish we had kept the road we intended, or waited at  Monkbarns for the carriage.\"    Sir Arthur looked round, but did not see, or would not acknowledge, any  signs of an immediate storm. They would reach Knockwinnock, he said,  long before the tempest began. But the speed with which he walked, and  with which Isabella could hardly keep pace, indicated a feeling that  some exertion was necessary to accomplish his consolatory prediction.    They were now near the centre of a deep but narrow bay or recess, formed  by two projecting capes of high and inaccessible rock, which shot out  into the sea like the horns of a crescent;--and neither durst communicate  the apprehension which each began to entertain, that, from the unusually  rapid advance of the tide, they might be deprived of the power of  proceeding by doubling the promontory which lay before them, or of  retreating by the road which brought them thither.    As they thus pressed forward, longing doubtless to exchange the easy  curving line, which the sinuosities of the bay compelled them to adopt,  for a straighter and more expeditious path, Sir Arthur observed a human  figure on the beach advancing to meet them. \"Thank God,\" he exclaimed,  \"we shall get round Halket-head!--that person must have passed it;\" thus  giving vent to the feeling of hope, though he had suppressed that of  apprehension.    \"Thank God, indeed!\" echoed his daughter, half audibly, half internally,  as expressing the gratitude which she strongly felt.    The figure which advanced to meet them made many signs, which the  haze of the atmosphere, now disturbed by wind and by a drizzling rain,  prevented them from seeing or comprehending distinctly.--Some time before  they met, Sir Arthur could recognise the old blue-gowned beggar, Edie  Ochiltree. It is said that even the brute creation lay aside their  animosities and"]]]
