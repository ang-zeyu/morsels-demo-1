The leech at once gave him his care, and several of the  crowd of muttering and whispering men, who had made their way in out of  curiosity or with a wish to be of use, now hurried hither and thither in  obedience to the physician's orders.    As soon as he saw the Masdakite's wound he exclaimed angrily:    \"A true Egyptian blow, dealt from behind!--What does this mob want here?  Out with every man who does not belong to the place! The first things  needed are litters. Will you, Dame Neforis, desire that two rooms may  be got ready; one for that poor, gentle creature, and one for this fine  fellow, though all will soon be over with him, short of a miracle.\"    \"To the north of the viridarium,\" replied the lady, \"there are two rooms  at your service.\"    \"Not there!\" cried the leech. \"I must have rooms with plenty of fresh  air, looking out upon the river.\"    \"There are none but the handsome rooms in the visitor's quarters, where  my husband's niece has hers, Sick persons of the family have often lain  there, but for such humble folk--you understand?\"    \"No--I am deaf,\" replied the physician.    \"Oh, I know that,\" laughed Neforis. \"But those rooms are really just  refurnished for exalted guests.\"    \"It would be hard to find any more exalted than such as these, sick unto  death,\" replied Philippus. \"They are nearer to God in Heaven than you  are; to your advantage I believe. Here, you people! Carry these poor  souls up to the guests' rooms.\"          CHAPTER IX.    \"It is impossible, impossible, impossible!\" cried Orion, jumping up from  his writing-table. He thought of what he had done as a misfortune, and  not as a crime; he himself hardly knew how it had all come about. Yes,  there must be demons, evil, spiteful demons--and it was they who had led  him to so mad a deed.    Yesterday evening, after the buying of the hanging, he had yielded to  his mother's request that he should escort the widow Susannah home. At  her house he had met her husband's brother, a jovial old fellow named  Chrysippus; and when the conversation turned on the tapestry, and the  Mukaukas' purpose of dedicating this work of art with all the gems  worked into it, to the Church, the old man had clasped his hands, fully  sharing Orion's disapproval, and had exclaimed laughing \"What, you  the son, and is not even a part of the precious stones to fall to your  share? Why Katharina? Just a little diamond, a tiny opal might well  add to the earthly happiness of the young, though the old must lay up  treasure in heaven.--Do not be a fool! The Church's maw is full enough,  and really a mouthful is your due.\"    And then they drank a good deal of fine wine, till at last the older man  had accompanied Orion home, to stretch his limbs in the cool night air.  A litter was carried behind him for him to return in, and all the way  he had continued to persuade the youth to induce his father not to fling  the whole treasure into the jaws of the Church, but to spare him a few  stones at least for a more pleasing use. They had laughed over it a good  deal, and Orion in his heart had thought Chrysippus very right, and  had remembered Heliodora, and her love of large, handsome gems, and the  keepsake he owed her. But that neither his father nor his mother would  remove a single stone, and that the whole hanging would be dedicated,  was beyond a doubt; at the same time, some of this superfluous splendor  was in fact his due as their son, and a prettier gift to Heliodora than  the large emerald could not be imagined. Yes--and she should have it!  How delighted she would be! He even thought of the chief idea for the  verses to accompany the gift.    He had the key of the tablinum, in which the work was lying, about his  person; and when, on his return, he found the servants still sitting  round the fire, he shut the door of the out-buildings while a feeling  came over him which he remembered having experienced last on occasions  when he and his brothers had robbed a forbidden fruit-tree. He was  on the point of giving up his mad project; and when, in the tablinum  itself, a horrible inward tremor again came over him he had actually  turned to retreat--but he remembered old Chrysippus and his prompts.  To turn and fly now would be cowardice. Heliodora must have the large  emerald, and with his verses; his father might give away all the rest as  he pleased. When he was kneeling in front of the work with his knife in  his hand, that sickening terror had come over him for the third time; if  the large emerald had not come off into his hand at the first effort he  would certainly have rolled the bale up again and have left the tablinum  clean-handed. But the evil demon had been at his elbow, had thrust  the gem into his hand, as it were, so that two cuts with the knife had  sufficed to displace it from its setting. It rolled into his hand and he  felt its noble weight; he cast aside all care, and had thought no more  with anything but pleasure of this splendid trick, which he would relate  to-morrow to old Chrysippus--of course under seal of secrecy.    But now, in the sober light of day, how different did this mad, rash  deed appear; how heavily had he already been punished; what consequences  might it not entail? His hatred of Paula grew every minute: she had  certainly seen all that had happened and would not hesitate to betray  him--that she had shown last night. War, as it were, was declared  between them, and he vowed to himself, with fire in his eyes, that he  would not shirk it! At the same time he could not deny that she had  never looked handsomer than when she stood, with hair half undone,  confronting him--threatening him. \"It is to be love or hate between  us.\" he muttered to himself. \"No half-measures: and she has chosen hate!  Good! Hitherto I have only had to fight against men; but this bold,  hard, and scornful maiden, who rejects every gentle feeling, is no  despicable foe. She has me at bay. If she does her worst by me I will  return it in kind!--And who is the owner of the shoes? I have taken all  possible means to find him. Shameful, shameful! that I cannot hold up  my head to look boldly at my own face in the glass. Heliodora is a sweet  creature, an angel of kindness. She loved me truly; but this--this--Ah;  even for her, this is too great a sacrifice!\"    He pressed his hand to his brow and flung himself on a divan. He might  well be weary, for he had not closed his eyes for more than thirty hours  and had already done much business that morning. He had given orders to  Sebek the house-steward and to the captain of the Egyptian guard to hunt  out the owner of the sandals by the aid of the dogs, and to cast him  into prison; next he had of his own accord--since his father generally  did not fall asleep till the morning and had not yet left his  room--tried to pacify the Arab merchant with regard to the mishap that  had befallen his head man under the governor's roof; but with small  success.    Finally the young man had indulged his desire to compose a few lines  addressed to the fair Heliodora--for there was no form of physical or  mental effort to which he was not trained. He had not lost the idea that  had occurred to him yesterday before his theft in the tablinum, and  to put it into verse was in his present mood an easy task. He wrote as  follows:       \"'Like liketh like' saith the saw; and like to like is but fitting.     Yet, in the hardest of gems thy soft nature rejoices?     Nay, but if noble and rare, if its beauty is priceless,     Then, Heliodora, the stone is like thee--akin to thy beauty.     Thus let this emerald please thee;--and know that the fire     That fills it with light burns more fierce in the heart of thy                                Friend.\"    He penned the lines rapidly; and as he did so he felt, he knew not why,  an excited thrill, as though every word he threw off was a blow aimed  at Paula. Last night he had intended to send the costly jewel to  the handsome widow in a suitable setting; but now it would be madly  imprudent to order such a thing. He must send it away at once; he had  hastened to pack it up with the verses, with his own hand, and entrusted  it to Chusar, a horsedealer's groom from Constantinople, who had  brought his Pannonian steeds to Memphis. He had himself seen off this  trustworthy messenger, who could speak no Egyptian and very little  Greek, and when his horse was lost to sight in the dust of the road  leading to Alexandria he had returned home in a calmer mood. Ships were  constantly putting to sea from that port for Constantinople, and Chusar  was enjoined to sail by the first that should be leaving. At least the  odious deed should not have been committed in vain; and yet he would  have given a year of his life if now he could but know that it had never  been done.    \"Impossible!\" and \"Curse it!\" were the words he had most frequently  repeated in the course of his retrospect during the past night and  morning. How he had had to rush and hurry under the broiling sun! and  the sense of being compelled to do so for mere concealment's sake seemed  to him--who had never in his life before done anything that he could not  justify in the eyes of honest men--so humiliating, that it brought the  sweat to his burning brow. He--Orion--to dread discovery as a thief! It  was inconceivable, and he was afraid, positively afraid for the first  time since his boyhood. His fortunate star, which in the Capital  had shone on him so brightly and benevolently, seemed to have proved  faithless in this ruinous hole! What had that Persian girl taken into  her crazy head that she must rush upon him like some furious beast  of prey? He had been bound to her once, no doubt, by a transient  passion--and what youth of his age was blind to the charms of a pretty  slave-girl?

One somewhere in Sutherland, and of harsh doings in the Outer  Isles. It was far more than a political grievance. It was the lament of  the conservative for vanished days and manners. 'Over in Skye wass the  fine land for black cattle, and every man had his bit herd on the  hillside. But the lairds said it wass better for sheep, and then they  said it wass not good for sheep, so they put it under deer, and now  there is no black cattle anywhere in Skye.' I tell you it was like sad  music on the bagpipes hearing that old fellow. The war and all things  modern meant nothing to him; he lived among the tragedies of his youth  and his prime.    I'm a Tory myself and a bit of a land-reformer, so we agreed well  enough. So well, that I got what I wanted without asking for it. I told  him I was going to Skye, and he offered to take me over in his boat in  the morning. 'It will be no trouble. Indeed no. I will be going that  way myself to the fishing.'    I told him that after the war, every acre of British soil would have to  be used for the men that had earned the right to it. But that did not  comfort him. He was not thinking about the land itself, but about the  men who had been driven from it fifty years before. His desire was not  for reform, but for restitution, and that was past the power of any  Government. I went to bed in the loft in a sad, reflective mood,  considering how in speeding our newfangled plough we must break down a  multitude of molehills and how desirable and unreplaceable was the life  of the moles.    In brisk, shining weather, with a wind from the south-east, we put off  next morning. In front was a brown line of low hills, and behind them,  a little to the north, that black toothcomb of mountain range which I  had seen the day before from the Arisaig ridge.    'That is the Coolin,' said the fisherman. 'It is a bad place where even  the deer cannot go. But all the rest of Skye wass the fine land for  black cattle.'    As we neared the coast, he pointed out many places. 'Look there, Sir,  in that glen. I haf seen six cot houses smoking there, and now there is  not any left. There were three men of my own name had crofts on the  machars beyond the point, and if you go there you will only find the  marks of their bit gardens. You will know the place by the gean trees.'    When he put me ashore in a sandy bay between green ridges of bracken,  he was still harping upon the past. I got him to take a pound--for the  boat and not for the night's hospitality, for he would have beaten me  with an oar if I had suggested that. The last I saw of him, as I turned  round at the top of the hill, he had still his sail down, and was  gazing at the lands which had once been full of human dwellings and now  were desolate.    I kept for a while along the ridge, with the Sound of Sleat on my  right, and beyond it the high hills of Knoydart and Kintail. I was  watching for the _Tobermory_, but saw no sign of her. A steamer put out  from Mallaig, and there were several drifters crawling up the channel  and once I saw the white ensign and a destroyer bustled northward,  leaving a cloud of black smoke in her wake. Then, after consulting the  map, I struck across country, still keeping the higher ground, but,  except at odd minutes, being out of sight of the sea. I concluded that  my business was to get to the latitude of Ranna without wasting time.    So soon as I changed my course I had the Coolin for company. Mountains  have always been a craze of mine, and the blackness and mystery of  those grim peaks went to my head. I forgot all about Fosse Manor and  the Cotswolds. I forgot, too, what had been my chief feeling since I  left Glasgow, a sense of the absurdity of my mission. It had all seemed  too far-fetched and whimsical. I was running apparently no great  personal risk, and I had always the unpleasing fear that Blenkiron  might have been too clever and that the whole thing might be a mare's  nest. But that dark mountain mass changed my outlook. I began to have a  queer instinct that that was the place, that something might be  concealed there, something pretty damnable. I remember I sat on a top  for half an hour raking the hills with my glasses. I made out ugly  precipices, and glens which lost themselves in primeval blackness. When  the sun caught them--for it was a gleamy day--it brought out no  colours, only degrees of shade. No mountains I had ever seen--not the  Drakensberg or the red kopjes of Damaraland or the cold, white peaks  around Erzerum--ever looked so unearthly and uncanny.    Oddly enough, too, the sight of them set me thinking about Ivery. There  seemed no link between a smooth, sedentary being, dwelling in villas  and lecture-rooms, and that shaggy tangle of precipices. But I felt  there was, for I had begun to realize the bigness of my opponent.  Blenkiron had said that he spun his web wide. That was intelligible  enough among the half-baked youth of Biggleswick, and the pacifist  societies, or even the toughs on the Clyde. I could fit him in all  right to that picture. But that he should be playing his game among  those mysterious black crags seemed to make him bigger and more  desperate, altogether a different kind of proposition. I didn't exactly  dislike the idea, for my objection to my past weeks had been that I was  out of my proper job, and this was more my line of country. I always  felt that I was a better bandit than a detective. But a sort of awe  mingled with my satisfaction. I began to feel about Ivery as I had felt  about the three devils of the Black Stone who had hunted me before the  war, and as I never felt about any other Hun. The men we fought at the  Front and the men I had run across in the Greenmantle business, even  old Stumm himself, had been human miscreants. They were formidable  enough, but you could gauge and calculate their capacities. But this  Ivery was like a poison gas that hung in the air and got into  unexpected crannies and that you couldn't fight in an upstanding way.  Till then, in spite of Blenkiron's solemnity, I had regarded him simply  as a problem. But now he seemed an intimate and omnipresent enemy,  intangible, too, as the horror of a haunted house. Up on that sunny  hillside, with the sea winds round me and the whaups calling, I got a  chill in my spine when I thought of him.    I am ashamed to confess it, but I was also horribly hungry. There was  something about the war that made me ravenous, and the less chance of  food the worse I felt. If I had been in London with twenty restaurants  open to me, I should as likely as not have gone off my feed. That was  the cussedness of my stomach. I had still a little chocolate left, and  I ate the fisherman's buttered scones for luncheon, but long before the  evening my thoughts were dwelling on my empty interior.    I put up that night in a shepherd's cottage miles from anywhere. The  man was called Macmorran, and he had come from Galloway when sheep were  booming. He was a very good imitation of a savage, a little fellow with  red hair and red eyes, who might have been a Pict. He lived with a  daughter who had once been in service in Glasgow, a fat young woman  with a face entirely covered with freckles and a pout of habitual  discontent. No wonder, for that cottage was a pretty mean place. It was  so thick with peat-reek that throat and eyes were always smarting. It  was badly built, and must have leaked like a sieve in a storm. The  father was a surly fellow, whose conversation was one long growl at the  world, the high prices, the difficulty of moving his sheep, the  meanness of his master, and the godforsaken character of Skye. 'Here's  me no seen baker's bread for a month, and no company but a wheen  ignorant Hielanders that yatter Gawlic. I wish I was back in the  Glenkens. And I'd gang the morn if I could get paid what I'm awed.'    However, he gave me supper--a braxy ham and oatcake, and I bought the  remnants off him for use next day. I did not trust his blankets, so I  slept the night by the fire in the ruins of an arm-chair, and woke at  dawn with a foul taste in my mouth. A dip in the burn refreshed me, and  after a bowl of porridge I took the road again. For I was anxious to  get to some hill-top that looked over to Ranna.    Before midday I was close under the eastern side of the Coolin, on a  road which was more a rockery than a path. Presently I saw a big house  ahead of me that looked like an inn, so I gave it a miss and struck the  highway that led to it a little farther north. Then I bore off to the  east, and was just beginning to climb a hill which I judged stood  between me and the sea, when I heard wheels on the road and looked back.    It was a farmer's gig carrying one man. I was about half a mile off,  and something in the cut of his jib seemed familiar. I got my glasses  on him and made out a short, stout figure clad in a mackintosh, with a  woollen comforter round its throat. As I watched, it made a movement as  if to rub its nose on its sleeve. That was the pet trick of one man I  knew. Inconspicuously I slipped through the long heather so as to reach  the road ahead of the gig. When I rose like a wraith from the wayside  the horse started, but not the driver.    'So ye're there,' said Amos's voice. 'I've news for ye. The _Tobermory_  will be in Ranna by now. She passed Broadford two hours syne. When I  saw her I yoked this beast and came up on the chance of foregathering  with ye.'    'How on earth did you know I would be here?' I asked in some surprise.    'Oh, I saw the way your mind was workin' from your telegram. And says I  to mysel'--that man Brand, says I, is not the chiel to be easy stoppit.  But I was feared ye might be a day late, so I came up the road to hold  the fort. Man, I'm glad to see ye. Ye're younger and soopler than me,  and yon Gresson's a stirrin' lad.'    'There's one thing you've got to do for me,' I said. 'I can't go into "]]]
