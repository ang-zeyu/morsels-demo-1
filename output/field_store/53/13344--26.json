The old and pagan genealogies still known to the Somal, are Dirr, Aydur,  Darud, and, according to some, Hawiyah. Dirr and Aydur, of whom nothing is  certainly known but the name [10], are the progenitors of the northern  Somal, the Eesa, Gudabirsi, Ishak, and Bursuk tribes. Darud Jabarti [11]  bin Ismail bin Akil (or Ukayl) is supposed by his descendants to have been  a noble Arab from El Hejaz, who, obliged to flee his country, was wrecked  on the north-east coast of Africa, where he married a daughter of the  Hawiyah tribe: rival races declare him to have been a Galla slave, who,  stealing the Prophet's slippers [12], was dismissed with the words, Inna-  _tarad_-na-hu (verily we have rejected him): hence his name Tarud  ([Arabic]) or Darud, the Rejected. [13] The etymological part of the story  is, doubtless, fabulous; it expresses, however, the popular belief that  the founder of the eastward or windward tribes, now extending over the  seaboard from Bunder Jedid to Ras Hafun, and southward from the sea to the  Webbes [14], was a man of ignoble origin. The children of Darud are now  divided into two great bodies: \"Harti\" is the family name of the  Dulbahanta, Ogadayn, Warsangali and Mijjarthayn, who call themselves sons  of Harti bin Kombo bin Kabl Ullah bin Darud: the other Darud tribes not  included under that appellation are the Girhi, Berteri, Marayhan, and  Bahabr Ali. The Hawiyah are doubtless of ancient and pagan origin; they  call all Somal except themselves Hashiyah, and thus claim to be equivalent  to the rest of the nation. Some attempt, as usual, to establish a holy  origin, deriving themselves like the Shaykhash from the Caliph Abubekr:  the antiquity, and consequently the Pagan origin of the Hawiyah are proved  by its present widely scattered state; it is a powerful tribe in the  Mijjarthayn country, and yet is found in the hills of Harar.    The Somal, therefore, by their own traditions, as well as their strongly  marked physical peculiarities, their customs, and their geographical  position, may be determined to be a half-caste tribe, an offshoot of the  great Galla race, approximated, like the originally Negro-Egyptian, to the  Caucasian type by a steady influx of pure Asiatic blood.    In personal appearance the race is not unprepossessing. The crinal hair is  hard and wiry, growing, like that of a half-caste West Indian, in stiff  ringlets which sprout in tufts from the scalp, and, attaining a moderate  length, which they rarely surpass, hang down. A few elders, savans, and  the wealthy, who can afford the luxury of a turban, shave the head. More  generally, each filament is duly picked out with the comb or a wooden  scratcher like a knitting-needle, and the mass made to resemble a child's  \"pudding,\" an old bob-wig, a mop, a counsellor's peruke, or an old-  fashioned coachman's wig,--there are a hundred ways of dressing the head.  The Bedouins, true specimens of the \"greasy African race,\" wear locks  dripping with rancid butter, and accuse their citizen brethren of being  more like birds than men. The colouring matter of the hair, naturally a  bluish-black, is removed by a mixture of quicklime and water, or in the  desert by a _lessive_ of ashes [15]: this makes it a dull yellowish-white,  which is converted into red permanently by henna, temporarily by ochreish  earth kneaded with water. The ridiculous Somali peruke of crimsoned  sheepskin,--almost as barbarous an article as the Welsh,--is apparently a  foreign invention: I rarely saw one in the low country, although the hill  tribes about Harar sometimes wear a black or white \"scratch-wig.\" The head  is rather long than round, and generally of the amiable variety, it is  gracefully put on the shoulders, belongs equally to Africa and Arabia, and  would be exceedingly weak but for the beauty of the brow. As far as the  mouth, the face, with the exception of high cheek-bones, is good; the  contour of the forehead ennobles it; the eyes are large and well-formed,  and the upper features are frequently handsome and expressive. The jaw,  however, is almost invariably prognathous and African; the broad, turned-  out lips betray approximation to the Negro; and the chin projects to the  detriment of the facial angle. The beard is represented by a few tufts; it  is rare to see anything equal to even the Arab development: the long and  ample eyebrows admired by the people are uncommon, and the mustachios are  short and thin, often twisted outwards in two dwarf curls. The mouth is  coarse as well as thick-lipped; the teeth rarely project as in the Negro,  but they are not good; the habit of perpetually chewing coarse Surat  tobacco stains them [16], the gums become black and mottled, and the use  of ashes with the quid discolours the lips. The skin, amongst the tribes  inhabiting the hot regions, is smooth, black, and glossy; as the altitude  increases it becomes lighter, and about Harar it is generally of a _cafe  au lait_ colour. The Bedouins are fond of raising beauty marks in the  shape of ghastly seams, and the thickness of the epidermis favours the  size of these _stigmates_. The male figure is tall and somewhat ungainly.  In only one instance I observed an approach to the steatopyge, making the  shape to resemble the letter S; but the shoulders are high, the trunk is  straight, the thighs fall off, the shin bones bow slightly forwards, and  the feet, like the hands, are coarse, large, and flat. Yet with their  hair, of a light straw colour, decked with the light waving feather, and  their coal-black complexions set off by that most graceful of garments the  clean white Tobe [17], the contrasts are decidedly effective.    In mind the Somal are peculiar as in body. They are a people of most  susceptible character, and withal uncommonly hard to please. They dislike  the Arabs, fear and abhor the Turks, have a horror of Franks, and despise  all other Asiatics who with them come under the general name of Hindi  (Indians). The latter are abused on all occasions for cowardice, and a  want of generosity, which has given rise to the following piquant epigram:      \"Ask not from the Hindi thy want:    Impossible that the Hindi can be generous!    Had there been one liberal man in El Hind,    Allah had raised up a prophet in El Hind!\"    They have all the levity and instability of the Negro character; light-  minded as the Abyssinians,--described by Gobat as constant in nothing but  inconstancy,--soft, merry, and affectionate souls, they pass without any  apparent transition into a state of fury, when they are capable of  terrible atrocities. At Aden they appear happier than in their native  country. There I have often seen a man clapping his hands and dancing,  childlike, alone to relieve the exuberance of his spirits: here they  become, as the Mongols and other pastoral people, a melancholy race, who  will sit for hours upon a bank gazing at the moon, or croning some old  ditty under the trees. This state is doubtless increased by the perpetual  presence of danger and the uncertainty of life, which make them think of  other things but dancing and singing. Much learning seems to make them  mad; like the half-crazy Fakihs of the Sahara in Northern Africa, the  Widad, or priest, is generally unfitted for the affairs of this world, and  the Hafiz or Koran-reciter, is almost idiotic. As regards courage, they  are no exception to the generality of savage races. They have none of the  recklessness standing in lieu of creed which characterises the civilised  man. In their great battles a score is considered a heavy loss; usually  they will run after the fall of half a dozen: amongst a Kraal full of  braves who boast a hundred murders, not a single maimed or wounded man  will be seen, whereas in an Arabian camp half the male population will  bear the marks of lead and steel. The bravest will shirk fighting if he  has forgotten his shield: the sight of a lion and the sound of a gun  elicit screams of terror, and their Kaum or forays much resemble the style  of tactics rendered obsolete by the Great Turenne, when the tactician's  chief aim was not to fall in with his enemy. Yet they are by no means  deficient in the wily valour of wild men: two or three will murder a  sleeper bravely enough; and when the passions of rival tribes, between  whom there has been a blood feud for ages, are violently excited, they  will use with asperity the dagger and spear. Their massacres are fearful.  In February, 1847, a small sept, the Ayyal Tunis, being expelled from  Berberah, settled at the roadstead of Bulhar, where a few merchants,  principally Indian and Arab, joined them. The men were in the habit of  leaving their women and children, sick and aged, at the encampment inland,  whilst, descending to the beach, they carried on their trade. One day, as  they were thus employed, unsuspicious of danger, a foraging party of about  2500 Eesas attacked the camp: men, women, and children were  indiscriminately put to the spear, and the plunderers returned to their  villages in safety, laden with an immense amount of booty. At present, a  man armed with a revolver would be a terror to the country; the day,  however, will come when the matchlock will supersede the assegai, and then  the harmless spearman in his strong mountains will become, like the Arab,  a formidable foe. Travelling among the Bedouins, I found them kind and  hospitable. A pinch of snuff or a handful of tobacco sufficed to win every  heart, and a few yards of coarse cotton cloth supplied all our wants, I  was petted like a child, forced to drink milk and to eat mutton; girls  were offered to me in marriage; the people begged me to settle amongst  them, to head their predatory expeditions, free them from lions, and kill  their elephants; and often a man has exclaimed in pitying accents, \"What  hath brought thee, delicate as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#19)"],[1,"I felt,--that I was killing a wife, MY wife.    \"I well remember the horror of that consciousness and I know vaguely  that, having plunged in the dagger, I drew it out again immediately,  wishing to repair and arrest my action. She straightened up and cried:    \"'Nurse, he has killed me!'    \"The old nurse, who had heard the noise, was standing in the doorway. I  was still erect, waiting, and not believing myself in what had happened.  But at that moment, from under her corset, the blood gushed forth. Then  only did I understand that all reparation was impossible, and promptly  I decided that it was not even necessary, that all had happened in  accordance with my wish, and that I had fulfilled my desire. I waited  until she fell, and until the nurse, exclaiming, 'Oh, my God!' ran to  her; then only I threw away the dagger and went out of the room.    \"'I must not be agitated. I must be conscious of what I am doing,' I  said to myself, looking neither at her nor at the old nurse. The latter  cried and called the maid. I passed through the hall, and, after having  sent the maid, started for my study.    \"'What shall I do now?' I asked myself.    \"And immediately I understood what I should do. Directly after entering  the study, I went straight to the wall, took down the revolver, and  examined it attentively. It was loaded. Then I placed it on the table.  Next I picked up the sheath of the dagger, which had dropped down  behind the sofa, and then I sat down. I remained thus for a long time.  I thought of nothing, I did not try to remember anything. I heard a  stifled noise of steps, a movement of objects and of tapestries, then  the arrival of a person, and then the arrival of another person. Then  I saw Gregor bring into my room the baggage from the railway; as if any  one needed it!    \"'Have you heard what has happened?' I asked him. 'Have you told the  dvornik to inform the police?'    \"He made no answer, and went out. I rose, closed the door, took the  cigarettes and the matches, and began to smoke. I had not finished one  cigarette, when a drowsy feeling came over me and sent me into a deep  sleep. I surely slept two hours. I remember having dreamed that I was on  good terms with her, that after a quarrel we were in the act of making  up, that something prevented us, but that we were friends all the same.    \"A knock at the door awoke me.    \"'It is the police,' thought I, as I opened my eyes. 'I have killed, I  believe. But perhaps it is SHE; perhaps nothing has happened.'    \"Another knock. I did not answer. I was solving the question: 'Has it  happened or not? Yes, it has happened.'    \"I remembered the resistance of the corset, and then. . . . 'Yes, it has  happened. Yes, it has happened. Yes, now I must execute myself,' said I  to myself.    \"I said it, but I knew well that I should not kill myself. Nevertheless,  I rose and took the revolver, but, strange thing, I remembered that  formerly I had very often had suicidal ideas, that that very night, on  the cars, it had seemed to me easy, especially easy because I thought  how it would stupefy her. Now I not only could not kill myself, but I  could not even think of it.    \"'Why do it?' I asked myself, without answering.    \"Another knock at the door.    \"'Yes, but I must first know who is knocking. I have time enough.'    \"I put the revolver back on the table, and hid it under my newspaper. I  went to the door and drew back the bolt.    \"It was my wife's sister,--a good and stupid widow.    \"'Basile, what does this mean?' said she, and her tears, always ready,  began to flow.    \"'What do you want?' I asked roughly.    \"I saw clearly that there was no necessity of being rough with her, but  I could not speak in any other tone.    \"'Basile, she is dying. Ivan Fedorowitch says so.'    \"Ivan Fedorowitch was the doctor, HER doctor, her counsellor.    \"'Is he here?' I inquired.    \"And all my hatred of her arose anew.    \"Well, what?    \"'Basile, go to her! Ah! how terrible it is!' said she.    \"'Go to her?' I asked myself; and immediately I made answer to myself  that I ought to go, that probably that was the thing that is usually  done when a husband like myself kills his wife, that it was absolutely  necessary that I should go and see her.    \"'If that is the proper thing, I must go,' I repeated to myself. 'Yes,  if it is necessary, I shall still have time,' said I to myself, thinking  of my intention of blowing my brains out.    \"And I followed my sister-in-law. 'Now there are going to be phrases and  grimaces, but I will not yield,' I declared to myself.    \"'Wait,' said I to my sister-in-law, 'it is stupid to be without boots.  Let me at least put on my slippers.'\"        CHAPTER XXVIII.    \"Strange thing! Again, when I had left my study, and was passing through  the familiar rooms, again the hope came to me that nothing had happened.  But the odor of the drugs, iodoform and phenic acid, brought me back to  a sense of reality.    \"'No, everything has happened.'    \"In passing through the hall, beside the children's chamber, I saw  little Lise. She was looking at me, with eyes that were full of fear. I  even thought that all the children were looking at me. As I approached  the door of our sleeping-room, a servant opened it from within, and  came out. The first thing that I noticed was HER light gray dress upon  a chair, all dark with blood. On our common bed she was stretched, with  knees drawn up.    \"She lay very high, upon pillows, with her chemise half open. Linen had  been placed upon the wound. A heavy smell of iodoform filled the room.  Before, and more than anything else, I was astonished at her face, which  was swollen and bruised under the eyes and over a part of the nose. This  was the result of the blow that I had struck her with my elbow, when  she had tried to hold me back. Of beauty there was no trace left. I saw  something hideous in her. I stopped upon the threshold.    \"'Approach, approach her,' said her sister.    \"'Yes, probably she repents,' thought I; 'shall I forgive her? Yes, she  is dying, I must forgive her,' I added, trying to be generous.    \"I approached the bedside. With difficulty she raised her eyes, one of  which was swollen, and uttered these words haltingly:    \"'You have accomplished what you desired. You have killed me.'    \"And in her face, through the physical sufferings, in spite of the  approach of death, was expressed the same old hatred, so familiar to me.    \"'The children . . . I will not give them to you . . . all the  same. . . . She (her sister) shall take them.' . . .    \"But of that which I considered essential, of her fault, of her treason,  one would have said that she did not think it necessary to say even a  word.    \"'Yes, revel in what you have done.'    \"And she sobbed.    \"At the door stood her sister with the children.    \"'Yes, see what you have done!'    \"I cast a glance at the children, and then at her bruised and swollen  face, and for the first time I forgot myself (my rights, my pride), and  for the first time I saw in her a human being, a sister.    \"And all that which a moment before had been so offensive to me now  seemed to me so petty,--all this jealousy,--and, on the contrary, what  I had done seemed to me so important that I felt like bending over,  approaching my face to her hand, and saying:    \"'Forgive me!'    \"But I did not dare. She was silent, with eyelids lowered, evidently  having no strength to speak further. Then her deformed face began to  tremble and shrivel, and she feebly pushed me back.    \"'Why has all this happened? Why?'    \"'Forgive me,' said I.    \"'Yes, if you had not killed me,' she cried suddenly, and her eyes shone  feverishly. 'Forgiveness--that is nothing. . . . If I only do not die!  Ah, you have accomplished what you desired! I hate you!'    \"Then she grew delirious. She was frightened, and cried:    \"'Fire, I do not fear . . . but strike them all . . . He has gone. . . .  He has gone.' . . .    \"The delirium continued. She no longer recognized the children, not even  little Lise, who had approached. Toward noon she died. As for me, I was  arrested before her death, at eight o'clock in the morning. They took  me to the police station, and then to prison, and there, during eleven  months, awaiting the verdict, I reflected upon myself, and upon my past,  and I understood it. Yes, I began to understand from the third day. The  third day they took me to the house.\" . . .    Posdnicheff seemed to wish to add something, but, no longer having the  strength to repress his sobs, he stopped. After a few minutes, having  recovered his calmness, he resumed:    \"I began to understand only when I saw her in the coffin.\" . . .    He uttered a sob, and then immediately continued, with haste:    \"Then only, when I saw her dead face, did I understand all that I had  done. I understood that it was I, I, who had killed her. I understood  that I was the cause of the fact that she, who had been a moving,  living, palpitating being, had now become motionless and cold, and that  there was no way of repairing this thing. He who has not lived through  that cannot understand it.\"    *****    We remained silent a long time. Posdnicheff sobbed and trembled before  me. His face had become delicate and long, and his mouth had grown  larger.    \"Yes,\" said he suddenly, \"if I had known what I now know, I should never  have married her, never, not for anything.\"    Again we remained silent for a long time.    \"Yes, that is what I have done, that is my experience, We must  understand the real meaning of the words of the Gospel,--Matthew, V.  28,--'that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed  adultery'; and these words relate to the wife, to the sister, and not  only to the wife of another, but especially to one's own wife.\"    THE END.
