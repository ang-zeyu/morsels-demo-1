That was pleasant for him, I  dare say, so I do not complain. Still, it leaves me with no one to  take my place. Angels, as you will readily understand, are not  permitted to perpetrate murders, even in the way of kindness. It  might be thought to establish a dangerous precedent.\"    \"All this,\" said Jurgen, \"seems regrettable, but not strikingly  explicit. I have a heart and a half to serve you, sir, with not  seven-eighths of a notion as to what you want of me. Come, put a  name to it!\"    \"You have, as I have said, the family face. You are, in fact, the  living counterpart of Smoit of Glathion. So I beseech you, messire  my grandson, for this one night to impersonate my ghost, and with  the assistance of Queen Sylvia Tereu to see that at three o'clock  the White Turret is haunted to everyone's satisfaction. Otherwise,\"  said Smoit, gloomily, \"the consequences will be deplorable.\"    \"But I have had no experience at haunting,\" Jurgen confessed. \"It is  a pursuit in which I do not pretend to competence: and I do not even  know just how one goes about it.\"    \"That matter is simple, although mysterious preliminaries will be,  of course, necessitated, in order to convert a living person into a  ghost--\"    \"The usual preliminaries, sir, are out of the question: and I must  positively decline to be stabbed or poisoned or anything of that  kind, even to humor my grandfather.\"    Both Smoit and Sylvia protested that any such radical step would be  superfluous, since Jurgen's ghostship was to be transient. In fact,  all Jurgen would have to do would be to drain the embossed goblet  which Sylvia Tereu held out to him, with Druidical invocations.    And for a moment Jurgen hesitated. The whole business seemed rather  improbable. Still, the ties of kin are strong, and it is not often  one gets the chance to aid, however slightly, one's long-dead  grandfather: besides, the potion smelt very invitingly.    \"Well,\" says Jurgen, \"I am willing to taste any drink once.\" Then  Jurgen drank.    The flavor was excellent. Yet the drink seemed not to affect Jurgen,  at first. Then he began to feel a trifle light-headed. Next he  looked downward, and was surprised to notice there was nobody in his  bed. Closer investigation revealed the shadowy outline of a human  figure, through which the bedclothing had collapsed. This, he  decided, was all that was left of Jurgen. And it gave him a queer  sensation. Jurgen jumped like a startled horse, and so violently  that he flew out of bed, and found himself floating imponderably  about the room.    Now Jurgen recognized the feeling perfectly. He had often had it in  his sleep, in dreams wherein he would bend his legs at the knees so  that his feet came up behind him, and he would pass through the air  without any effort. Then it seemed ridiculously simple, and he would  wonder why he never thought of it before. And then he would reflect:  \"This is an excellent way of getting around. I will come to  breakfast this way in the morning, and show Lisa how simple it is.  How it will astonish her, to be sure, and how clever she will think  me!\" And then Jurgen would wake up, and find that somehow he had  forgotten the trick of it.    But just now this manner of locomotion was undeniably easy. So  Jurgen floated around his bed once or twice, then to the ceiling,  for practice. Through inexperience, he miscalculated the necessary  force, and popped through into the room above, where he found  himself hovering immediately over the Bishop of Merion. His eminence  was not alone, but as both occupants of the apartment were asleep,  Jurgen witnessed nothing unepiscopal. Now Jurgen rejoined his  grandfather, and girded on charmed Caliburn, and demanded what must  next be done.    \"The assassination will take place in the White Turret, as usual.  Queen Sylvia will instruct you in the details. You can invent most  of the affair, however, as the Lady of the Lake, who occupies this  room to-night, is very probably unacquainted with our terrible  history.\"    Then King Smoit observed that it was high time he kept his  appointment in Cornwall, and he melted into air, with an easy  confidence that bespoke long practise: and Jurgen followed Queen  Sylvia Tereu.          17.    About a Cock That Crowed Too Soon      Next the tale tells of how Jurgen and the ghost of Queen Sylvia  Tereu came into the White Turret. The Lady of the Lake was in bed:  she slept unaccompanied, as Jurgen noted with approval, for he  wished to intrude upon no more tete-a-tetes. And Dame Anaitis did  not at first awake.    Now this was a gloomy and high-paneled apartment, with exactly the  traditional amount of moonlight streaming through two windows. Any  ghost, even an apprentice, could have acquitted himself with credit  in such surroundings, and Jurgen thought he did extremely well. He  was atavistically brutal, and to improvise the accompanying dialogue  he did not find difficult. So everything went smoothly, and with  such spirit that Anaitis was presently wakened by Queen Sylvia's  very moving wails for mercy, and sat erect in bed, as though a  little startled. Then the Lady of the Lake leaned back among the  pillows, and witnessed the remainder of the terrible scene with  remarkable self-possession.    So it was that the tragedy swelled to its appalling climax, and  subsided handsomely. With the aid of Caliburn, Jurgen had murdered  his temporary wife. He had dragged her insensate body across the  floor, by the hair of her head, and had carefully remembered first  to put her comb in his pocket, as Queen Sylvia had requested, so  that it would not be lost. He had given vent to several fiendish  \"Ha-ha's\" and all the old high imprecations he remembered: and in  short, everything had gone splendidly when he left the White Turret  with a sense of self-approval and Queen Sylvia Tereu.    The two of them paused in the winding stairway; and in the darkness,  after he had restored her comb, the Queen was telling Jurgen how  sorry she was to part with him.    \"For it is back to the cold grave I must be going now, Messire  Jurgen, and to the tall flames of Purgatory: and it may be that I  shall not ever see you any more.\"    \"I shall regret the circumstance, madame,\" says Jurgen, \"for you are  the loveliest person I have ever seen.\"    The Queen was pleased. \"That is a delightfully boyish speech, and  one can see it comes from the heart. I only wish that I could meet  with such unsophisticated persons in my present abode. Instead, I am  herded with battered sinners who have no heart, who are not frank  and outspoken about anything, and I detest their affectations.\"    \"Ah, then you are not happy with your husband, Sylvia? I suspected  as much.\"    \"I see very little of Smoit. It is true he has eight other wives all  resident in the same flame, and cannot well show any partiality. Two  of his Queens, though, went straight to Heaven: and his eighth wife,  Gudrun, we are compelled to fear, must have been an unrepentant  sinner, for she has never reached Purgatory. But I always distrusted  Gudrun, myself: otherwise I would never have suggested to Smoit that  he have her strangled in order to make me his queen. You see, I  thought it a fine thing to be a queen, in those days, Jurgen, when I  was an artless slip of a girl. And Smoit was all honey and perfume  and velvet, in those days, Jurgen, and little did I suspect the  cruel fate that was to befall me.\"    \"Indeed, it is a sad thing, Sylvia, to be murdered by the hand  which, so to speak, is sworn to keep an eye on your welfare, and  which rightfully should serve you on its knees.\"    \"It was not that I minded. Smoit killed me in a fit of jealousy, and  jealousy is in its blundering way a compliment. No, a worse thing  than that befell me, Jurgen, and embittered all my life in the  flesh.\" And Sylvia began to weep.    \"And what was that thing, Sylvia?\"    Queen Sylvia whispered the terrible truth. \"My husband did not  understand me.\"    \"Now, by Heaven,\" says Jurgen, \"when a woman tells me that, even  though the woman be dead, I know what it is she expects of me.\"    So Jurgen put his arm about the ghost of Queen Sylvia Tereu, and  comforted her. Then, finding her quite willing to be comforted,  Jurgen sat for a while upon the dark steps, with one arm still about  Queen Sylvia. The effect of the potion had evidently worn off,  because Jurgen found himself to be composed no longer of cool  imponderable vapor, but of the warmest and hardest sort of flesh  everywhere. But probably the effect of the wine which Jurgen had  drunk earlier in the evening had not worn off: for now Jurgen began  to talk wildishly in the dark, about the necessity of his, in some  way, avenging the injury inflicted upon his nominal grandfather,  Ludwig, and Jurgen drew his sword, charmed Caliburn.    \"For, as you perceive,\" said Jurgen, \"I carry such weapons as are  sufficient for all ordinary encounters. And am I not to use them, to  requite King Smoit for the injustice he did poor Ludwig? Why,  certainly I must. It is my duty.\"    \"Ah, but Smoit by this is back in Purgatory,\" Queen Sylvia  protested, \"And to draw your sword against a woman is cowardly.\"    \"The avenging sword of Jurgen, my charming Sylvia, is the terror of  envious men, but it is the comfort of all pretty women.\"    \"It is undoubtedly a very large sword,\" said she: \"oh, a magnificent  sword, as I can perceive even in the dark. But Smoit, I repeat, is  not here to measure weapons with you.\"    \"Now your arguments irritate me, whereas an honest woman would see  to it that all the legacies of her dead husband were duly  satisfied--\"    \"Oh, oh! and what do you mean--?\"    \"Well, but certainly a grandson is--at one remove, I grant you,--a  sort of legacy.\"    \"There is something in what you advance--\"    \"There is a great deal in what I advance, I can assure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell.

But if I here might see the sorrowing soul  Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,  For Branda's limpid spring I would not change  The welcome sight.  One is e'en now within,  If truly the mad spirits tell, that round  Are wand'ring.  But wherein besteads me that?  My limbs are fetter'd.  Were I but so light,  That I each hundred years might move one inch,  I had set forth already on this path,  Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,  Although eleven miles it wind, not more  Than half of one across.  They brought me down  Among this tribe; induc'd by them I stamp'd  The florens with three carats of alloy.\"    \"Who are that abject pair,\" I next inquir'd,  \"That closely bounding thee upon thy right  Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd  In the chill stream?\"--\"When to this gulf I dropt,\"  He answer'd, \"here I found them; since that hour  They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I ween,  Till time hath run his course.  One is that dame  The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;  Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.  Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,  In such a cloud upsteam'd.\"  When that he heard,  One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd,  With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch,  That like a drum resounded: but forthwith  Adamo smote him on the face, the blow  Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard.    \"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me  The power to move,\" said he, \"I have an arm  At liberty for such employ.\"  To whom  Was answer'd: \"When thou wentest to the fire,  Thou hadst it not so ready at command,  Then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold.\"    And thus the dropsied: \"Ay, now speak'st thou true.  But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,  When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy.\"    \"If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin,\"  Said Sinon; \"I am here but for one fault,  And thou for more than any imp beside.\"    \"Remember,\" he replied, \"O perjur'd one,  The horse remember, that did teem with death,  And all the world be witness to thy guilt.\"    \"To thine,\" return'd the Greek, \"witness the thirst  Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,  Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes,  A mass corrupt.\"  To whom the coiner thus:  \"Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass  Its evil saying.  Me if thirst assails,  Yet I am stuff'd with moisture.  Thou art parch'd,  Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need  To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up.\"    I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide  Admonish'd: \"Now beware: a little more,  And I do quarrel with thee.\"  I perceiv'd  How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd  With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet  Confounds me.  As a man that dreams of harm  Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,  And that which is, desires as if it were not,  Such then was I, who wanting power to speak  Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while  Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did.    \"More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,\"  My master cried, \"might expiate.  Therefore cast  All sorrow from thy soul; and if again  Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,  Think I am ever at thy side.  To hear  Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.\"          CANTO XXXI    THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before  Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,  Now minister'd my cure.  So have I heard,  Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd  Pain first, and then the boon of health restor'd.    Turning our back upon the vale of woe,  W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence.  There  Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom  Mine eye advanc'd not: but I heard a horn  Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made  The thunder feeble.  Following its course  The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent  On that one spot.  So terrible a blast  Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout  O'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench'd  His saintly warfare.  Thitherward not long  My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers  Methought I spied.  \"Master,\" said I, \"what land  Is this?\"  He answer'd straight: \"Too long a space  Of intervening darkness has thine eye  To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err'd  In thy imagining.  Thither arriv'd  Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude  The sense.  A little therefore urge thee on.\"    Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;  \"Yet know,\" said he, \"ere farther we advance,  That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,  But giants.  In the pit they stand immers'd,  Each from his navel downward, round the bank.\"    As when a fog disperseth gradually,  Our vision traces what the mist involves  Condens'd in air; so piercing through the gross  And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more  We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,  And fear came o'er me.  As with circling round  Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,  E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,  Was turreted with giants, half their length  Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav'n  Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls.    Of one already I descried the face,  Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge  Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.    All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand  Left framing of these monsters, did display  Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War  Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she  Repent her not of th' elephant and whale,  Who ponders well confesses her therein  Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force  And evil will are back'd with subtlety,  Resistance none avails.  His visage seem'd  In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops  Saint Peter's Roman fane; and th' other bones  Of like proportion, so that from above  The bank, which girdled him below, such height  Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders  Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair.  Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd  Downward from whence a man his garments loops.  \"Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,\"  So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns  Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:    \"O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee  Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage  Or other passion wring thee.  Search thy neck,  There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.  Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast  Where hangs the baldrick!\"  Then to me he spake:  \"He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this,  Through whose ill counsel in the world no more  One tongue prevails.  But pass we on, nor waste  Our words; for so each language is to him,  As his to others, understood by none.\"    Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,  And at a sling's throw found another shade  Far fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say  What master hand had girt him; but he held  Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before  The other with a chain, that fasten'd him  From the neck down, and five times round his form  Apparent met the wreathed links.  \"This proud one  Would of his strength against almighty Jove  Make trial,\" said my guide; \"whence he is thus  Requited: Ephialtes him they call.    \"Great was his prowess, when the giants brought  Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,  Now moves he never.\"  Forthwith I return'd:  \"Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes  Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd  Experience next.\"  He answer'd: \"Thou shalt see  Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks  And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there  Where guilt is at its depth.  Far onward stands  Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made  Like to this spirit, save that in his looks  More fell he seems.\"  By violent earthquake rock'd  Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,  As Ephialtes.  More than ever then  I dreaded death, nor than the terror more  Had needed, if I had not seen the cords  That held him fast.  We, straightway journeying on,  Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete  Without the head, forth issued from the cave.    \"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made  Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword  Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,  Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil  An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought  In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,  Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm  The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe  To place us down beneath, where numbing cold  Locks up Cocytus.  Force not that we crave  Or Tityus' help or Typhon's.  Here is one  Can give what in this realm ye covet.  Stoop  Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.  He in the upper world can yet bestow  Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks  For life yet longer, if before the time  Grace call him not unto herself.\"  Thus spake  The teacher.  He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,  And caught my guide.  Alcides whilom felt  That grapple straighten'd score.  Soon as my guide  Had felt it, he bespake me thus: \"This way  That I may clasp thee;\" then so caught me up,  That we were both one burden.  As appears  The tower of Carisenda, from beneath  Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud  So sail across, that opposite it hangs,  Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease  I mark'd him stooping.  I were fain at times  T' have pass'd another way.  Yet in th' abyss,  That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,  Lightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,  But rose as in a bark the stately mast.          CANTO XXXII    COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit  That hole of sorrow, o'er which ev'ry rock  His firm abutment rears, then might the vein  Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine  Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch  The mighty theme; for to describe the depth  Of all the universe, is no emprize  To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd  To infant babbling.  But let them assist  My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid  Amphion wall'd in Thebes, so with the"]]]
