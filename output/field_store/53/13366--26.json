Shoeblossom was a curious mixture of the Energetic Ragger and the  Quiet Student. On a Monday evening you would hear a hideous uproar  proceeding from Seymour's junior day-room; and, going down with a  swagger-stick to investigate, you would find a tangled heap of  squealing humanity on the floor, and at the bottom of the heap,  squealing louder than any two others, would be Shoeblossom, his collar  burst and blackened and his face apoplectically crimson. On the  Tuesday afternoon, strolling in some shady corner of the grounds you  would come upon him lying on his chest, deep in some work of fiction  and resentful of interruption. On the Wednesday morning he would be in  receipt of four hundred lines from his housemaster for breaking three  windows and a gas-globe. Essentially a man of moods, Shoeblossom.    It happened about the date of the Geddington match that he took out  from the school library a copy of \"The Iron Pirate,\" and for the next  day or two he wandered about like a lost spirit trying to find a  sequestered spot in which to read it. His inability to hit on such a  spot was rendered more irritating by the fact that, to judge from the  first few chapters (which he had managed to get through during prep.  one night under the eye of a short-sighted master), the book was  obviously the last word in hot stuff. He tried the junior day-room,  but people threw cushions at him. He tried out of doors, and a ball  hit from a neighbouring net nearly scalped him. Anything in the nature  of concentration became impossible in these circumstances.    Then he recollected that in a quiet backwater off the High Street  there was a little confectioner's shop, where tea might be had at a  reasonable sum, and also, what was more important, peace.    He made his way there, and in the dingy back shop, all amongst the  dust and bluebottles, settled down to a thoughtful perusal of chapter  six.    Upstairs, at the same moment, the doctor was recommending that Master  John George, the son of the house, be kept warm and out of draughts  and not permitted to scratch himself, however necessary such an action  might seem to him. In brief, he was attending J. G. for chicken-pox.    Shoeblossom came away, entering the High Street furtively, lest  Authority should see him out of bounds, and returned to the school,  where he went about his lawful occasions as if there were no such  thing as chicken-pox in the world.    But all the while the microbe was getting in some unostentatious but  clever work. A week later Shoeblossom began to feel queer. He had  occasional headaches, and found himself oppressed by a queer distaste  for food. The professional advice of Dr. Oakes, the school doctor, was  called for, and Shoeblossom took up his abode in the Infirmary, where  he read _Punch_, sucked oranges, and thought of Life.    Two days later Barry felt queer. He, too, disappeared from Society.    Chicken-pox is no respecter of persons. The next victim was Marsh, of  the first eleven. Marsh, who was top of the school averages. Where  were his drives now, his late cuts that were wont to set the pavilion  in a roar. Wrapped in a blanket, and looking like the spotted marvel  of a travelling circus, he was driven across to the Infirmary in a  four-wheeler, and it became incumbent upon Burgess to select a  substitute for him.    And so it came about that Mike soared once again into the ranks of the  elect, and found his name down in the team to play against the  Incogniti.          CHAPTER XVIII    BOB HAS NEWS TO IMPART      Wrykyn went down badly before the Incogs. It generally happens at  least once in a school cricket season that the team collapses  hopelessly, for no apparent reason. Some schools do it in nearly every  match, but Wrykyn so far had been particularly fortunate this year.  They had only been beaten once, and that by a mere twenty odd runs in  a hard-fought game. But on this particular day, against a not  overwhelmingly strong side, they failed miserably. The weather may  have had something to do with it, for rain fell early in the morning,  and the school, batting first on the drying wicket, found themselves  considerably puzzled by a slow left-hander. Morris and Berridge left  with the score still short of ten, and after that the rout began. Bob,  going in fourth wicket, made a dozen, and Mike kept his end up, and  was not out eleven; but nobody except Wyatt, who hit out at everything  and knocked up thirty before he was stumped, did anything to  distinguish himself. The total was a hundred and seven, and the  Incogniti, batting when the wicket was easier, doubled this.    The general opinion of the school after this match was that either  Mike or Bob would have to stand down from the team when it was  definitely filled up, for Neville-Smith, by showing up well with the  ball against the Incogniti when the others failed with the bat, made  it practically certain that he would get one of the two vacancies.    \"If I do\" he said to Wyatt, \"there will be the biggest bust of modern  times at my place. My pater is away for a holiday in Norway, and I'm  alone, bar the servants. And I can square them. Will you come?\"    \"Tea?\"    \"Tea!\" said Neville-Smith scornfully.    \"Well, what then?\"    \"Don't you ever have feeds in the dorms. after lights-out in the  houses?\"    \"Used to when I was a kid. Too old now. Have to look after my  digestion. I remember, three years ago, when Wain's won the footer  cup, we got up and fed at about two in the morning. All sorts of  luxuries. Sardines on sugar-biscuits. I've got the taste in my mouth  still. Do you remember Macpherson? Left a couple of years ago. His  food ran out, so he spread brown-boot polish on bread, and ate that.  Got through a slice, too. Wonderful chap! But what about this thing of  yours? What time's it going to be?\"    \"Eleven suit you?\"    \"All right.\"    \"How about getting out?\"    \"I'll do it as quickly as the team did to-day. I can't say more than  that.\"    \"You were all right.\"    \"I'm an exceptional sort of chap.\"    \"What about the Jacksons?\"    \"It's going to be a close thing. If Bob's fielding were to improve  suddenly, he would just do it. But young Mike's all over him as a bat.  In a year or two that kid'll be a marvel. He's bound to get in next  year, of course, so perhaps it would be better if Bob got the place as  it's his last season. Still, one wants the best man, of course.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mike avoided Bob as much as possible during this anxious period; and  he privately thought it rather tactless of the latter when, meeting  him one day outside Donaldson's, he insisted on his coming in and  having some tea.    Mike shuffled uncomfortably as his brother filled the kettle and lit  the Etna. It required more tact than he had at his disposal to carry  off a situation like this.    Bob, being older, was more at his ease. He got tea ready, making  desultory conversation the while, as if there were no particular  reason why either of them should feel uncomfortable in the other's  presence. When he had finished, he poured Mike out a cup, passed him  the bread, and sat down.    \"Not seen much of each other lately, Mike, what?\"    Mike murmured unintelligibly through a mouthful of bread-and-jam.    \"It's no good pretending it isn't an awkward situation,\" continued  Bob, \"because it is. Beastly awkward.\"    \"Awful rot the pater sending us to the same school.\"    \"Oh, I don't know. We've all been at Wrykyn. Pity to spoil the record.  It's your fault for being such a young Infant Prodigy, and mine for not  being able to field like an ordinary human being.\"    \"You get on much better in the deep.\"    \"Bit better, yes. Liable at any moment to miss a sitter, though. Not  that it matters much really whether I do now.\"    Mike stared.    \"What! Why?\"    \"That's what I wanted to see you about. Has Burgess said anything to  you yet?\"    \"No. Why? What about?\"    \"Well, I've a sort of idea our little race is over. I fancy you've  won.\"    \"I've not heard a word----\"    \"I have. I'll tell you what makes me think the thing's settled. I  was in the pav. just now, in the First room, trying to find a  batting-glove I'd mislaid. There was a copy of the _Wrykynian_  lying on the mantelpiece, and I picked it up and started reading it.  So there wasn't any noise to show anybody outside that there was some  one in the room. And then I heard Burgess and Spence jawing on the  steps. They thought the place was empty, of course. I couldn't help  hearing what they said. The pav.'s like a sounding-board. I heard every  word. Spence said, 'Well, it's about as difficult a problem as any  captain of cricket at Wrykyn has ever had to tackle.' I had a sort of  idea that old Billy liked to boss things all on his own, but apparently  he does consult Spence sometimes. After all, he's cricket-master, and  that's what he's there for. Well, Billy said, 'I don't know what to  do. What do you think, sir?' Spence said, 'Well, I'll give you my  opinion, Burgess, but don't feel bound to act on it. I'm simply saying  what I think.' 'Yes, sir,' said old Bill, doing a big Young Disciple  with Wise Master act. '_I_ think M.,' said Spence. 'Decidedly M.  He's a shade better than R. now, and in a year or two, of course,  there'll be no comparison.'\"    \"Oh, rot,\" muttered Mike, wiping the sweat off his forehead. This was  one of the most harrowing interviews he had ever been through.    \"Not at all. Billy agreed with him. 'That's just what I think, sir,'  he said. 'It's rough on Bob, but still----' And then they walked down  the steps. I waited a bit to give them a good start, and then sheered  off myself. And so home.\"    Mike looked at the floor, and said nothing.    There was nothing much to _be_ said.    \"Well, what I wanted to see you about was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#19)"],[1,"and barking, as  Johnny hurriedly let the string go, and put his eye to his peep-hole.    The eyes of the Princess were wide open now, and she clapped her hands  when Pippo brought the gay picture for her to see; while the old woman,  with a long yawn, went away, carrying her distaff, like a gun, over her  shoulder.    \"She likes it! I'm so glad. Wish I had some more to send over. This will  come off, I'll poke it through, and maybe she will see it.\"    Very much excited, Johnny recklessly tore from the wall his most  cherished picture, a gay flower-piece, just put up; and folding it, he  thrust it through the hole and waited to see what followed.    Nothing but a rustle, a bark, and a queer croak from the splendid bird,  which set the canaries to trilling sweetly.    \"She don't see, maybe she will hear,\" said Johnny. And he began to  whistle like a mocking-bird; for this was his one accomplishment, and he  was proud of it.    Presently he heard a funny burst of laughter from the parrot, and then  the voice said,--    \"No, Polly, you can't sing like that bird. I wonder where he is? Among  the bushes over there, I think. Come, Pippo, let us go and find him.\"    \"Now she's coming!\" And Johnny grew red in the face trying to give his  best trills and chirrups.    Nearer and nearer came the steps, the lilacs rustled as if shaken, and  presently the roll of paper vanished. A pause, and then the little voice  exclaimed, in a tone of great surprise,--    \"Why, there's a hole! I never saw it before. Oh! I can see the street.  How nice! how nice!\"    \"She likes the hole! I wonder if she will like me?\" And, emboldened by  these various successes, Johnny took another peep. This was the most  delicious one of all; for he looked right into a great blue eye, with  glimpses of golden hair above, a little round nose in the middle, and  red lips below. It was like a flash of sunshine, and Johnny winked, as  if dazzled; for the eye sparkled, the nose sniffed daintily, and the  pretty mouth broke into a laugh as the voice cried out delightedly,--    \"I see some one! Who are you? Come and tell me!\"    \"I'm Johnny Morris,\" answered the boy, quite trembling with pleasure.    \"Did you make this nice hole?\"    \"I just poked a brick, and it fell out.\"    \"Papa won't mind. Is that your bird?\"    \"No; it's me. I whistled.\"    \"It's very pretty. Do it again,\" commanded the voice, as if used to give  orders.    Johnny obeyed; and when he paused, out of breath, a small hand came  through the hole, grasping as many lilies of the valley as it could  hold, and the Princess graciously expressed her pleasure by saying,--    \"I like it; you shall do it again, by and by. Here are some flowers for  you. Now we will talk. Are you a nice boy?\"    This was a poser; and Johnny answered meekly, with his nose luxuriously  buried in the lovely flowers,--    \"Not very,--I'm lame; I can't play like other fellers.\"    \"_Porverino_!\" sighed the little voice, full of pity; and, in a moment,  three red-and-yellow tulips fell at Johnny's feet, making him feel as if  he really had slipped into fairy-land through that delightful hole.    \"Oh, thank you! Aren't they just elegant? I never see such beauties,\"  stammered the poor boy, grasping his treasures as if he feared they  might vanish away.    \"You shall have as many as you like. Nanna will scold, but papa won't  mind. Tell me more. What do you do over there?\" asked the child,  eagerly.    \"Nothing but paste pictures and make books, when I don't ache too bad. I  used to help mother; but I got hurt, and I can't do much now,\" answered  the boy, ashamed to mention how many laces he patiently picked or  clapped, since it was all he could do to help.    \"If you like pictures, you shall come and see mine some day. I do a  great many. Papa shows me how. His are splendid. Do you draw or paint  yours?\"    \"I only cut 'em out of papers, and stick 'em on this wall or put 'em  in scrap-books. I can't draw, and I haven't got no paints,\" answered  Johnny.    \"You should say 'haven't any paints.' I will come and see you some day;  and if I like you, I will let you have my old paint-box. Do you want  it?\"    \"Guess I do!\"    \"I think I _shall_ like you; so I'll bring it when I come. Do you ache  much?\"    \"Awfully, sometimes. Have to lay down all day, and can't do a thing.\"    \"Do you cry?\"    \"No! I'm too big for that. I whistle.\"    \"I _know_ I shall like you, because you are brave!\" cried the impetuous  voice, with its pretty accent; and then an orange came tumbling through  the hole, as if the new acquaintance longed to do something to help the  \"ache.\"    \"Isn't that a rouser! I do love 'em, but mother can't afford 'em often.\"  And Johnny took one delicious taste on the spot.    \"Then I shall give you many. We have loads at home, much finer than  these. Ah, you should see our garden there!\"    \"Where do you live?\" Johnny ventured to ask; for there was a homesick  sound to the voice as it said those last words.    \"In Rome. Here we only stay a year, while papa arranges his affairs;  then we go back, and I am happy.\"    \"I should think you'd be happy in there. It looks real splendid to me,  and I've been longing to see it ever since I could come out.\"    \"It's a dull place to me. I like better to be where it's always warm,  and people are more beautiful than here. Are _you_ beautiful?\"    \"What queer questions she does ask!\" And poor Johnny was so perplexed he  could only stammer, with a laugh,--    \"I guess not. Boys don't care for looks.\"    \"Peep, and let me see. I like pretty persons,\" commanded the voice.    \"Don't she order round?\" thought Johnny, as he obeyed. But he liked it,  and showed such a smiling face at the peep-hole, that Princess Fay was  pleased to say, after a long look at him,--    \"No, you are not beautiful; but your eyes are bright, and you look  pleasant, so I don't mind the freckles on your nose and the whiteness  of your face. I think you are good. I am sorry for you, and I shall lend  you a book to read when the pain comes.\"    \"I couldn't wait for that if I had a book. I do _love_ so to read!\" And  Johnny laughed out from sheer delight at the thought of a new book; for  he seldom got one, being too poor to buy them, and too helpless to enjoy  the free libraries of the city.    \"Then you shall have it _now_.\" And there was another quick rush in the  garden, followed by the appearance of a fat little book, slowly pushed  through the hole in the wall.    \"This is the only one that will pass. You will like Hans Andersen's  fairy tales, I know. Keep it as long as you please. I have many more.\"    \"You're so good! I wish I had something for you,\" said the boy, quite  overcome by this sweet friendliness.    \"Let me see one of _your_ books. They will be new to me. I'm tired of  all mine.\"    Quick as a flash, off went the cover of the old boiler, and out came  half-a-dozen of Johnny's best works, to be crammed through the wall,  with the earnest request,--    \"Keep 'em all; they're not good for much, but they're the best I've got.  I'll do some prettier ones as soon as I can find more nice pictures and  pieces.\"    \"They look very interesting. I thank you. I shall go and read them now,  and then come and talk again. Addio, Giovanni.\"    \"Good-by, Miss.\"    Thus ended the first interview of little Pyramus and Thisbe through the  hole in the wall, while puss sat up above and played moonshine with her  yellow eyes.          PART II.      After that day a new life began for Johnny, and he flourished like a  poor little plant that has struggled out of some dark corner into the  sunshine. All sorts of delightful things happened, and good times  really seemed to have come. The mysterious papa made no objection to the  liberties taken with his wall, being busy with his own affairs, and glad  to have his little girl happy. Old Nanna, being more careful, came to  see the new neighbors, and was disarmed at once by the affliction of the  boy and the gentle manners of the mother. She brought all the curtains  of the house for Mrs. Morris to do up, and in her pretty broken English  praised Johnny's gallery and library, promising to bring Fay to see him  some day.    Meantime the little people prattled daily together, and all manner of  things came and went between them. Flowers, fruit, books, and bonbons  kept Johnny in a state of bliss, and inspired him with such brilliant  inventions that the Princess never knew what agreeable surprise would  come next. Astonishing kites flew over the wall, and tissue balloons  exploded in the flower-beds. All the birds of the air seemed to live in  that court; for the boy whistled and piped till he was hoarse, because  she liked it. The last of the long-hoarded cents came out of his tin  bank to buy paper and pictures for the gay little books he made for her.  His side of the wall was ravaged that hers might be adorned; and, as the  last offering his grateful heart could give, he poked the toad through  the hole, to live among the lilies and eat the flies that began to  buzz about her Highness when she came to give her orders to her devoted  subjects.    She always called the lad Giovanni, because she thought it a prettier  name than John; and she was never tired of telling stories, asking  questions, and making plans. The favorite one was what they would do  when Johnny came to see her, as she had been promised he should when  papa was not too busy to let them enjoy the charms of the studio;  for Fay was a true artist's child, and thought nothing so lovely as  pictures. Johnny thought so, too, and dreamed of the happy day when he  should go and see the wonders his little friend described so well.    \"I think it will be to-morrow; for papa has a lazy fit coming on, and  then he always plays with me and lets me rummage where I like, while he  goes out or smokes in the garden. So be ready; and if he says you can  come, I will have the flag up early and you can hurry.\"    These "]]]
