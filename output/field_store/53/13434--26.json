It happened, however, that the    emperor wished to send a princess as a bride to the Khan or Emperor of    Persia, also a Mongol sovereign, and the three Polos, who were known to    be trustworthy seamen, were selected to escort the princess to her royal    husband. After doing this they did not return to China, but went on    to Italy.      They had been absent twenty-four years, and they found that their    relatives had given them up for dead and did not recognize them. It was    like the old story of Ulysses, who, when he returned to his native    Ithaca after his wanderings, was recognized by nobody. The Polos proved    the truth of what they said by showing the great treasures which they    had sewed into the dresses of coarse stuff of a Tartar pattern which    they wore. They displayed jewels of the greatest value, diamonds,    emeralds, rubies, and sapphires.      [Illustration: MAP OF MARCO POLO'S TRAVELS    The known world is in white, the undiscovered in black, and that first    described by Marco Polo is dotted]    WHAT MARCO POLO TOLD. In the account Marco Polo wrote of his    travels and of the countries he had visited he described a wonderful    palace of the Great Emperor. Its walls were covered with gold and    silver, the dining hall seated six thousand people, and its ceiling was    inlaid with gold. This palace seemed to Marco Polo so large, so rich,    and so beautiful that no man on earth could design anything to equal it.    The robes of the emperor and his twelve thousand nobles and knights were    of silk and beaten gold, each having a girdle of gold decorated with    precious stones.      Marco Polo told of great cities in China where men traded in the costly    wares of the East, and where silk was abundant and cheap. He described    from hearsay Japan as an island fifteen hundred miles from the mainland.    Its people, he said, were white, civilized, and wondrously rich. The    palace of the emperor of Japan was roofed with gold, its pavements and    floors were of solid gold, laid in plates two fingers thick.    REASONS FOR FINDING A SEA ROUTE TO THE EAST. Tales of such great    wealth made Europeans more eager than ever to reach the East. Marco Polo    had shown that it was possible to sail past India, through the islands,    to the eastern coast of Asia. When printing was invented his account was    printed, and the copy of that book which Columbus owned is still    preserved. Upon its margins Columbus wrote his own opinions about    geography.      Other travelers besides the Polos returned with similar tales of the    East. Soon, however, all chance to go there by way of the land was lost,    because the Mongol emperors were driven out of China and the new rulers    would not permit Europeans to enter the country. The ordinary caravan    routes to the East were also closed not long afterwards. In 1453 the    Turks captured Constantinople, drove away the Italian merchants, and    prevented European sailors from reaching the Black Sea. Fifty years    later the Turks seized Egypt and closed that route also. Fortunately    before this happened a better route had been discovered.    THE PORTUGUESE SAILORS. During the Middle Ages the Portuguese princes    fought to recover Portugal from the Moors. When this was done they were    eager to cross the straits and attack the Moors in Africa. Prince Henry    of Portugal made an expedition to Africa and returned with the desire to    know more about the coast south of the point beyond which European    sailors dared not venture. Sailors were afraid of being lost in the Sea    of Darkness or killed by the heat of the boiling tropics.      [Illustration: DANGERS OF THE \"SEA OF DARKNESS\" From an old    picture]      From his love of exploring the seas Prince Henry has been called \"The    Navigator.\" He took up his residence on a lonely promontory in southern    Portugal, and gathered about him learned men of all peoples, Arabian and    Jewish mathematicians, and Italian mapmakers. Captains trained in this    new school of seamanship were sent into the southern seas. Each was to    sail farther down the western coast of Africa than other captains had    gone. Before Prince Henry died in 1460 his captains had passed Cape    Verde, and ten years later they crossed the equator without suffering    the fate which men had once feared. But they were discouraged when they    found that beyond the Gulf of Guinea the coast turned southward again,    for they had hoped to sail eastward to Asia.      [Illustration: THE PORTUGUESE ROUTE TO INDIA    The broken lines show the old trade routes to the East. The solid line    shows the new Portuguese route]    CAPE OF GOOD HOPE DISCOVERED. At last in 1487 the end of what    seemed to be an endless coast was reached. The fortunate captain who    accomplished this was Bartholomew Diaz, who came of a family of daring    seamen. He had been sailing southward along the coast for nearly eight    months, when a northerly gale drove him before it for thirteen days. The    weather cleared and Diaz turned eastward to find the coast. As he did    not see land he turned northward and soon discovered land to the west.    This showed that he had passed the southern point of Africa. His crew    were unwilling to go farther and he followed the coast around to the    western side again. The southern point he called the Cape of Storms, but    the king of Portugal, when the voyagers returned, named it the Cape of    Good Hope, for now he knew that an expedition could be sent directly to    the Indies.      Diaz had sailed thirteen thousand miles, and his voyage was the most    wonderful that Europeans had ever heard about.    THE SEA ROUTE TO INDIA. Eleven years later the Portuguese king sent    Vasco da Gama, another captain, to attempt to reach the coast of India    by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope which Diaz had discovered. Da    Gama was successful and landed at Calicut on the south-western coast of    India. He returned to Portugal in 1499, and his cargo was worth sixty    times the cost of the voyage. This was the beginning of a trade with the    East which enriched Portugal and especially the merchants of Lisbon.            QUESTIONS        1.

Six years before Vasco da Gama made his    famous voyage to India around Africa and opened a new trade route for    the Portuguese merchants, another seaman had formed and carried out a    much bolder plan. This was Christopher Columbus, and his plan was to    sail directly west from Europe into the unknown ocean in search of new    islands and the coast of Asia. Columbus, who was a native of Genoa in    Italy, had followed his younger brother to Portugal. Both were probably    led there by the fame of Prince Henry's explorations.      The brothers became very skilful in making maps and charts for the    Portuguese. They also frequently sailed with them on their expeditions    along the coast of Africa. All the early associations of Columbus were    with men interested in voyages of discovery, and particularly with those    engaged in the daring search for a sea route to India.    HOW COLUMBUS FORMED HIS PLAN. Columbus gathered all the information    on geography which he could from ancient writers and from modern    discoverers. Many of them believed that the world was shaped like a    ball. If such were its shape, Columbus reasoned, why might not a ship    sail around it from east to west? Or, better, why not sail directly west    to India, and perhaps find many wonderful islands between Europe and    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#19)"],[1," The door fell open, and he found himself confronted by what seemed to  him a dazzling torrent of light and a host of human faces. He drew  himself up beside the doorway.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Andrew, \"I am not a bum. I am worth five thousand  dollars to the man who turns me over, dead or alive, to the sheriff. My  name is Andrew Lanning.\"    At that the faces became a terrible rushing and circling flare, and the  lights went out with equal suddenness. He was left in total darkness,  falling through space; but, at his last moment of consciousness, he felt  arms going about him, arms through which his bulk kept slipping down,  and below him was a black abyss.          CHAPTER 23      It was a very old man who held, or tried to hold, Andrew from falling to  the floor. His shoulders shook under the burden of the outlaw, and the  burden, indeed, would have slumped brutally to the floor, had not the  small ten-year-old boy, whom Andrew had seen on the bay mare, come  running in under the arms of the old man. With his meager strength he  assisted, and the two managed to lower the body gently.    The boy was frightened. He was white at the sight of the wounds, and the  freckles stood out in copper patches from his pallor.    Now he clung to the old man.    \"Granddad, it's the gent that tried to buy Sally!\"    The old man had produced a murderous jackknife with a blade that had  been ground away to the disappearing point by years of steady grinding.    \"Get some wood in the stove,\" he commanded. \"Fire her up, quick. Put on  some water. Easy, lad!\"    The room became a place of turmoil with the clatter of the stove lids  being raised, the clangor of the kettle being filled and put in place.  By the time the fire was roaring and the boy had turned, he found the  bandages had been taken from the body of the stranger and his  grandfather was studying the smeared naked torso with a sort of  detached, philosophic interest. With the thumb and forefinger of his  left hand he was pressing deeply into the left shoulder of Andrew.    \"Now, there's an arm for you, Jud,\" said the old man. \"See them long,  stringy muscles in the forearm? If you grow up and have muscles like  them, you can call yourself a man. And you see the way his stomach caves  in? Aye, that's a sign! And the way his ribs sticks out--and just feel  them muscles on the point of his shoulder--Oh, Jud, he would of made a  prime wrestler, this fine bird of ours!\"    \"It's like touchin' somethin' dead, granddad,\" said the boy. \"I don't  dast to do it!\"    \"Jud, they's some times when I just about want to give you up! Dead? He  ain't nowheres near dead. Just bled a bit, that's all. Two as pretty  little wounds as was ever drilled clean by a powerful rifle at short  range. Dead? Why, inside two weeks he'll be fit as a fiddle, and inside  a month he'll be his own self! Dead! Jud, you make me tired! Gimme  that water.\"    He went to work busily. Out of a sort of first-aid chest he took  homemade bandages and, after cleansing the wounds, he began to dress  them carefully.    He talked with every movement.    \"So this here is the lion, is it?\" nodded granddad. \"This here is the  ravenin', tearin', screechin' man-eater? Why, he looks mostly plain  kid to me.\"    \"He--he's been shot, ain't he, granddad?\" asked the child in a whisper.    \"Well, boy, I'd say that the lion had been chawed up considerable--by  dogs.\"    He pointed. \"See them holes? The big one in front? That means they  sneaked up behind him and shot him while his back was turned.\"    \"He's wakin' up, granddad,\" said Jud, more frightened than before.    The eyes of Andrew were indeed opening.    He smiled up at them. \"Uncle Jas,\" he said, \"I don't like to fight. It  makes me sick inside, to fight.\" He closed his eyes again.    \"Now, now, now!\" murmured Pop. \"This boy has a way with him. And he  killed Bill Dozier, did he? Son, gimme the whisky.\"    He poured a little down the throat of the wounded man, and Andrew  frowned and opened his eyes again: He was conscious at last.    \"I think I've seen you before,\" he said calmly. \"Are you one of the  posse?\"    The old man stiffened a little. A spot of red glowed on his withered  cheek and went out like a snuffed light.    \"Young feller,\" said the old man, \"when I go huntin' I go alone. You  write that down in red, and don't forget it. I ain't ever been a member  of no posse. Look around and see yourself to home.\"    Andrew raised his head a little and made out the neat room. It showed,  as even his fading senses had perceived when he saw the house first, a  touch of almost feminine care. The floor was scrubbed to whiteness, the  very stove was burnished.    \"I remember,\" said Andrew faintly.    \"You did see me before,\" said the other, \"when you rode into Tomo. I  seen you and you seen me. We changed looks, so to speak. And now you've  dropped in to call on me. I'm goin' to put you up in the attic. Gimme a  hand to straighten him up, Jud.\"    With Jud's help and the last remnant of Andrew's strength they managed  to get him to his feet, and then he partly climbed, partly was pushed by  Jud, and partly was dragged by the old man up a ladder to the loft. It  was quite cool there, very dark, and the air came in through  two windows.    \"Ain't very sociable to put a guest in the attic,\" said Pop, between his  panting breaths. \"But a public character like you, Lanning, will have a  consid'able pile of callers askin' after you. Terrible jarrin' to the  nerves when folks come in and call on a sick man. You lie here and  rest easy.\"    He went down the ladder and came back dragging a mattress. There, by the  light of a lantern, he and Jud made Andrew as comfortable as possible.    \"You mean to keep me here?\" asked the outlaw.    \"Long as you feel like restin',\" answered the old man.    \"You can make about--\"    \"Stop that fool talk about what I can make out of you. How come it you  stayed so close to Tomo? Where was you lyin' low? In the hills?\"    \"Not far away.\" \"And they smelled you out?\"    \"A man I thought was my friend--\" Andrew clicked his teeth shut.    \"You was sold, eh?\"    \"I made a mistake.\"    \"H'm,\" was the other's comment. \"Well, you forget about that and go to  sleep. I got a few little attentions to pay to that posse. It'll be here  r'arin' before tomorrer. Sleep tight, partner.\"    He climbed down the ladder and looked around the room. Jud, his freckles  still looking like spots of mud or rust, his eyes popping, stood silent.    \"I'm glad of that,\" said the old man, with a sigh.    \"What, granddad?\"    \"You're like a girl, Jud. Takes a sight to make you reasonable quiet.  But look yonder. Them spots look tolerable like red paint, don't they?  Well, we got to get 'em off.\"    \"I'll heat some more water,\" suggested Jud.    \"You do nothing of the kind. You get them two butcher knives out of the  table drawer and we'll scrape off the wood, because you can't wash that  stain out'n a floor.\" He looked suddenly at Jud with a glint in his  eyes. \"I know, because I've tried it.\"    For several minutes they scraped hard at the floor until the last  vestige of the fresh stains was gone. Then the old man went outside and,  coming back with a handful of sand, rubbed it in carefully over the  scraped places. When this was swept away the floor presented no  suspicious traces.    \"But,\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"I forgot. I plumb forgot. He's been  leakin' all the way here, and when the sun comes up they'll foller him  that easy by the sign. Jud, we're beat!\"    They dropped, as at a signal, into two opposite chairs, and sat staring  gloomily at each other. The old man looked simply sad and weary, but the  color came and went in the face of Jud. And then, like a light, an idea  dawned in the face of the child. He got up from his chair, lighted a  lantern, and went outside. His grandfather observed this without comment  or suggestion, but, when Jud was gone, he observed to himself: \"Jud  takes after me. He's got thoughts. And them was things his ma and pa was  never bothered with.\"          CHAPTER 24      The thought of Jud now took him up the back trail of Andrew Lanning. He  leaned far over with the lantern, studying with intense interest every  place where the wounds of the injured man might have left telltale  stains on the rocks or the grass. When he had apparently satisfied  himself of this, he turned and ran at full speed back to the house and  went up the ladder to Andrew. There he took the boots--they were  terribly stained, he saw--and drew them on.    The loose boots and the unaccustomed weights tangled his feet sadly, as  he went on down the ladder, but he said not a word to his grandfather,  who was far too dignified to make a comment on the borrowed footgear.    Again outside with his lantern, the boy took out his pocket-knife and  felt the small blade. It was of a razor keenness. Then he went through  the yard behind the house to the big henhouse, where the chickens sat  perched in dense rows. He raised his lantern; at once scores of tiny,  bright eyes flashed back at him.    But Jud, with a twisted face of determination, kept on with his survey  until he saw the red comb and the arched tail plumes of a large Plymouth  Rock rooster.    It was a familiar sight to Jud. Of all the chickens on the place this  was his peculiar property. And now he had determined to sacrifice this  dearest of pets.    The old rooster was so accustomed to his master, indeed, that he allowed  himself to be taken from the perch without a single squawk, and the boy  took his captive beyond the pen. Once, when the big rooster canted his  head and looked into his face, the boy had to wink away the tears; but  he thought of the man so near death in the attic, he felt the clumsy  boots on his feet, and his heart grew strong again.    He went around to the front of the house and by the steps he fastened on  the long neck of his prisoner a grasp strong enough to keep him silent  for a moment. "]]]
