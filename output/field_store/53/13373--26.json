Then after dinner we let the girls have a dolls' tea-party, on condition  they didn't expect us boys to wash up; and it was when we were drinking  the last of the liquorice water out of the little cups that Dicky said--    'This reminds me.'    So we said, 'What of?'    Dicky answered us at once, though his mouth was full of bread with  liquorice stuck in it to look like cake. You should not speak with your  mouth full, even to your own relations, and you shouldn't wipe your  mouth on the back of your hand, but on your handkerchief, if you have  one. Dicky did not do this. He said--    'Why, you remember when we first began about treasure-seeking, I said  I had thought of something, only I could not tell you because I hadn't  finished thinking about it.'    We said 'Yes.'    'Well, this liquorice water--'    'Tea,' said Alice softly.    'Well, tea then--made me think.' He was going on to say what it made him  think, but Noel interrupted and cried out, 'I say; let's finish off this  old tea-party and have a council of war.'    So we got out the flags and the wooden sword and the drum, and Oswald  beat it while the girls washed up, till Eliza came up to say she had the  jumping toothache, and the noise went through her like a knife. So of  course Oswald left off at once. When you are polite to Oswald he never  refuses to grant your requests.    When we were all dressed up we sat down round the camp fire, and Dicky  began again.    'Every one in the world wants money. Some people get it. The people who  get it are the ones who see things. I have seen one thing.'    Dicky stopped and smoked the pipe of peace. It is the pipe we did  bubbles with in the summer, and somehow it has not got broken yet.  We put tea-leaves in it for the pipe of peace, but the girls are not  allowed to have any. It is not right to let girls smoke. They get to  think too much of themselves if you let them do everything the same as  men. Oswald said, 'Out with it.'    'I see that glass bottles only cost a penny. H. O., if you dare to  snigger I'll send you round selling old bottles, and you shan't have any  sweets except out of the money you get for them. And the same with you,  Noel.'    'Noel wasn't sniggering,' said Alice in a hurry; 'it is only his taking  so much interest in what you were saying makes him look like that. Be  quiet, H. O., and don't you make faces, either. Do go on, Dicky dear.'    So Dicky went on.    'There must be hundreds of millions of bottles of medicines sold every  year. Because all the different medicines say, \"Thousands of cures  daily,\" and if you only take that as two thousand, which it must be, at  least, it mounts up. And the people who sell them must make a great deal  of money by them because they are nearly always two-and-ninepence  the bottle, and three-and-six for one nearly double the size. Now the  bottles, as I was saying, don't cost anything like that.'    'It's the medicine costs the money,' said Dora; 'look how expensive  jujubes are at the chemist's, and peppermints too.'    'That's only because they're nice,' Dicky explained; 'nasty things are  not so dear. Look what a lot of brimstone you get for a penny, and the  same with alum. We would not put the nice kinds of chemist's things in  our medicine.'    Then he went on to tell us that when we had invented our medicine we  would write and tell the editor about it, and he would put it in  the paper, and then people would send their two-and-ninepence and  three-and-six for the bottle nearly double the size, and then when the  medicine had cured them they would write to the paper and their letters  would be printed, saying how they had been suffering for years, and  never thought to get about again, but thanks to the blessing of our  ointment--'    Dora interrupted and said, 'Not ointment--it's so messy.' And Alice  thought so too. And Dicky said he did not mean it, he was quite decided  to let it be in bottles. So now it was all settled, and we did not  see at the time that this would be a sort of going into business, but  afterwards when Albert's uncle showed us we saw it, and we were sorry.  We only had to invent the medicine. You might think that was easy,  because of the number of them you see every day in the paper, but it is  much harder than you think. First we had to decide what sort of illness  we should like to cure, and a 'heated discussion ensued', like in  Parliament.    Dora wanted it to be something to make the complexion of dazzling  fairness, but we remembered how her face came all red and rough when  she used the Rosabella soap that was advertised to make the darkest  complexion fair as the lily, and she agreed that perhaps it was better  not. Noel wanted to make the medicine first and then find out what  it would cure, but Dicky thought not, because there are so many more  medicines than there are things the matter with us, so it would be  easier to choose the disease first. Oswald would have liked wounds.  I still think it was a good idea, but Dicky said, 'Who has wounds,  especially now there aren't any wars? We shouldn't sell a bottle a day!'  So Oswald gave in because he knows what manners are, and it was Dicky's  idea. H. O. wanted a cure for the uncomfortable feeling that they give  you powders for, but we explained to him that grown-up people do not  have this feeling, however much they eat, and he agreed. Dicky said  he did not care a straw what the loathsome disease was, as long as we  hurried up and settled on something. Then Alice said--    'It ought to be something very common, and only one thing. Not the pains  in the back and all the hundreds of things the people have in somebody's  syrup. What's the commonest thing of all?'    And at once we said, 'Colds.'    So that was settled.    Then we wrote a label to go on the bottle. When it was written it would  not go on the vinegar bottle that we had got, but we knew it would go  small when it was printed. It was like this:                     BASTABLE'S             CERTAIN CURE FOR COLDS  Coughs, Asthma, Shortness of Breath, and all infections of the Chest         One dose gives immediate relief     It will cure your cold in one bottle       Especially the larger size at 3s. 6d.         Order at once of the Makers         To prevent disappointment                   Makers:         D., O., R., A., N., and H. O. BASTABLE               150, Lewisham Road, S.E.        (A halfpenny for all bottles returned)                 ------------    Of course the next thing was for one of us to catch a cold and try what  cured it; we all wanted to be the one, but it was Dicky's idea, and he  said he was not going to be done out of it, so we let him. It was only  fair. He left off his undershirt that very day, and next morning he  stood in a draught in his nightgown for quite a long time. And we damped  his day-shirt with the nail-brush before he put it on. But all was vain.  They always tell you that these things will give you cold, but we found  it was not so.    So then we all went over to the Park, and Dicky went right into the  water with his boots on, and stood there as long as he could bear it,  for it was rather cold, and we stood and cheered him on. He walked home  in his wet clothes, which they say is a sure thing, but it was no go,  though his boots were quite spoiled. And three days after Noel began to  cough and sneeze.    So then Dicky said it was not fair.    'I can't help it,' Noel said. 'You should have caught it yourself, then  it wouldn't have come to me.'    And Alice said she had known all along Noel oughtn't to have stood about  on the bank cheering in the cold.    Noel had to go to bed, and then we began to make the medicines; we were  sorry he was out of it, but he had the fun of taking the things.    We made a great many medicines. Alice made herb tea. She got sage and  thyme and savory and marjoram and boiled them all up together with salt  and water, but she _would_ put parsley in too. Oswald is sure parsley is  not a herb. It is only put on the cold meat and you are not supposed to  eat it. It kills parrots to eat parsley, I believe. I expect it was the  parsley that disagreed so with Noel. The medicine did not seem to do the  cough any good.    Oswald got a pennyworth of alum, because it is so cheap, and some  turpentine which every one knows is good for colds, and a little sugar  and an aniseed ball. These were mixed in a bottle with water, but Eliza  threw it away and said it was nasty rubbish, and I hadn't any money to  get more things with.    Dora made him some gruel, and he said it did his chest good; but of  course that was no use, because you cannot put gruel in bottles and say  it is medicine. It would not be honest, and besides nobody would believe  you.    Dick mixed up lemon-juice and sugar and a little of the juice of the red  flannel that Noel's throat was done up in. It comes out beautifully  in hot water. Noel took this and he liked it. Noel's own idea was  liquorice-water, and we let him have it, but it is too plain and black  to sell in bottles at the proper price.    Noel liked H. O.'s medicine the best, which was silly of him, because it  was only peppermints melted in hot water, and a little cobalt to make  it look blue. It was all right, because H. O.'s paint-box is the French  kind, with Couleurs non Veneneuses on it. This means you may suck your  brushes if you want to, or even your paints if you are a very little  boy.    It was rather jolly while Noel had that cold. He had a fire in his  bedroom which opens out of Dicky's and Oswald's, and the girls used to  read aloud to Noel all day; they will not read aloud to you when you are  well. Father was away at Liverpool on business, and Albert's uncle was  at Hastings. We were rather glad of this, because we wished to give  all the medicines a fair trial, and grown-ups are but too fond of  interfering.

I've worn the blue. And at last I've come to  see this crush and darkness and tumult and dead men carried by in heaps  on the ways. And all his doing! All his doing!\"    His voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of Ostrog.    Graham thought. \"Let me see,\" he said, \"if I have it right.\"    He extended a hand and ticked off points upon his fingers. \"The Sleeper  has been asleep--\"    \"Changed,\" said the old man.    \"Perhaps. And meanwhile the Sleeper's property grew in the hands of  Twelve Trustees, until it swallowed up nearly all the great ownership of  the world. The Twelve Trustees--by virtue of this property have become  virtually masters of the world. Because they are the paying power--just  as the old English Parliament used to be--\"    \"Eh!\" said the old man. \"That's so--that's a good comparison. You're not  so--\"    \"And now this Ostrog--has suddenly revolutionised the world by waking  the Sleeper--whom no one but the superstitious, common people had ever  dreamt would wake again--raising the Sleeper to claim his property from  the Council, after all these years.\"    The old man endorsed this statement with a cough. \"It's strange,\"  he said, \"to meet a man who learns these things for the first time  tonight.\"    \"Aye,\" said Graham, \"it's strange.\"    \"Have you been in a Pleasure City?\" said the old man. \"All my life I've  longed--\" He laughed. \"Even now,\" he said, \"I could enjoy a little  fun. Enjoy seeing things, anyhow.\" He mumbled a sentence Graham did not  understand.    \"The Sleeper--when did he awake?\" said Graham suddenly.    \"Three days ago.\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"Ostrog has him. He escaped from the Council not four hours ago. My  dear sir, where were you at the time? He was in the hall of the  markets--where the fighting has been. All the city was screaming about  it. All the Babble Machines! Everywhere it was shouted. Even the fools  who speak for the Council were admitting it. Everyone was rushing off to  see him--everyone was getting arms. Were you drunk or asleep? And even  then! But you're joking! Surely you're pretending. It was to stop the  shouting of the Babble Machines and prevent the people gathering that  they turned off the electricity--and put this damned darkness upon us.  Do you mean to say--?\"    \"I had heard the Sleeper was rescued,\" said Graham. \"But--to come back a  minute. Are you sure Ostrog has him?\"    \"He won't let him go,\" said the old man.    \"And the Sleeper. Are you sure he is not genuine? I have never heard--\"    \"So all the fools think. So they think. As if there wasn't a thousand  things that were never heard. I know Ostrog too well for that. Did  I tell you? In a way I'm a sort of relation of Ostrog's. A sort of  relation. Through my daughter-in-law.\"      \"I suppose--\"    \"Well?\"    \"I suppose there's no chance of this Sleeper asserting himself. I  suppose he's certain to be a puppet--in Ostrog's hands or the Council's,  as soon as the struggle is over.\"    \"In Ostrog's hands--certainly. Why shouldn't he be a puppet? Look at his  position. Everything done for him, every pleasure possible. Why should  he want to assert himself?\"    \"What are these Pleasure Cities?\" said Graham, abruptly.    The old man made him repeat the question. When at last he was assured  of Graham's words, he nudged him violently. \"That's too much,\" said he.  \"You're poking fun at an old man. I've been suspecting you know more  than you pretend.\"    \"Perhaps I do,\" said Graham. \"But no! why should I go on acting? No, I  do not know what a Pleasure City is.\"    The old man laughed in an intimate way.    \"What is more, I do not know how to read your letters, I do not know  what money you use, I do not know what foreign countries there are. I  do not know where I am. I cannot count. I do not know where to get food,  nor drink, nor shelter.\"    \"Come, come,\" said the old man, \"if you had a glass of drink, now, would  you put it in your ear or your eye?\"    \"I want you to tell me all these things.\"    \"He, he! Well, gentlemen who dress in silk must have their fun.\" A  withered hand caressed Graham's arm for a moment. \"Silk. Well, well!  But, all the same, I wish I was the man who was put up as the Sleeper.  He'll have a fine time of it. All the pomp and pleasure. He's a queer  looking face. When they used to let anyone go to see him, I've got  tickets and been. The image of the real one, as the photographs show  him, this substitute used to be. Yellow. But he'll get fed up. It's a  queer world. Think of the luck of it. The luck of it. I expect he'll be  sent to Capri. It's the best fun for a greener.\"    His cough overtook him again. Then he began mumbling enviously of  pleasures and strange delights. \"The luck of it, the luck of it! All my  life I've been in London, hoping to get my chance.\"    \"But you don't know that the Sleeper died,\" said Graham, suddenly.    The old man made him repeat his words.    \"Men don't live beyond ten dozen. It's not in the order of things,\" said  the old man. \"I'm not a fool. Fools may believe it, but not me.\"    Graham became angry with the old man's assurance. \"Whether you are a  fool or not,\" he said, \"it happens you are wrong about the Sleeper.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"You are wrong about the Sleeper. I haven't told you before, but I will  tell you now. You are wrong about the Sleeper.\"    \"How do you know? I thought you didn't know anything--not even about  Pleasure Cities.\"    Graham paused.    \"You don't know,\" said the old man. \"How are you to know? It's very few  men--\"    \"I _am_ the Sleeper.\"    He had to repeat it.    There was a brief pause. \"There's a silly thing to say, sir, if you'll  excuse me. It might get you into trouble in a time like this,\" said the  old man. Graham, slightly dashed, repeated his assertion.    \"I was saying I was the Sleeper. That years and years ago I did, indeed,  fall asleep, in a little stonebuilt village, in the days when there were  hedgerows, and villages, and inns, and all the countryside cut up into  little pieces, little fields. Have you never heard of those days? And it  is I--I who speak to you--who awakened again these four days since.\"    \"Four days since!--the Sleeper! But they've got the Sleeper. They have  him and they won't let him go. Nonsense! You've been talking sensibly  enough up to now. I can see it as though I was there. There will be  Lincoln like a keeper just behind him; they won't let him go about  alone. Trust them. You're a queer fellow. One of these fun pokers. I see  now why you have been clipping your words so oddly, but--\"    He stopped abruptly, and Graham could see his gesture.    \"As if Ostrog would let the Sleeper run about alone! No, you're telling  that to the wrong man altogether. Eh! as if I should believe. What's  your game? And besides, we've been talking of the Sleeper.\"    Graham stood up. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I am the Sleeper.\"    \"You're an odd man,\" said the old man, \"to sit here in the dark, talking  clipped, and telling a lie of that sort. But--\"    Graham's exasperation fell to laughter. \"It is preposterous,\" he cried.  \"Preposterous. The dream must end. It gets wilder and wilder. Here am  I--in this damned twilight--I never knew a dream in twilight before--an  anachronism by two hundred years and trying to persuade an old fool that  I am myself, and meanwhile--Ugh!\"    He moved in gusty irritation and went striding. In a moment the old man  was pursuing him. \"Eh! but don't go!\" cried the old man. \"I'm an old  fool, I know. Don't go. Don't leave me in all this darkness.\"    Graham hesitated, stopped. Suddenly the folly of telling his secret  flashed into his mind.    \"I didn't mean to offend you--disbelieving you,\" said the old man coming  near. \"It's no manner of harm. Call yourself the Sleeper if it pleases  you. 'Tis a foolish trick.\"    Graham hesitated, turned abruptly and went on his way.    For a time he heard the old man's hobbling pursuit and his wheezy cries  receding. But at last the darkness swallowed him, and Graham saw him no  more.        CHAPTER XII. OSTROG    Graham could now take a clearer view of his position. For a long time  yet he wandered, but after the talk of the old man his discovery of this  Ostrog was clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision. One  thing was evident, those who were at the headquarters of the revolt had  succeeded very admirably in suppressing the fact of his disappearance.  But every moment he expected to hear the report of his death or of his  recapture by the Council.    Presently a man stopped before him. \"Have you heard?\" he said.    \"No!\" said Graham starting.    \"Near a dozand,\" said the man, \"a dozand men!\" and hurried on.    A number of men and a girl passed in the darkness, gesticulating and  shouting: \"Capitulated! Given up!\" \"A dozand of men.\" \"Two dozand of  men.\" \"Ostrog, Hurrah! Ostrog, Hurrah!\" These cries receded, became  indistinct.    Other shouting men followed. For a time his attention was absorbed  in the fragments of speech he heard. He had a doubt whether all were  speaking English. Scraps floated to him, scraps like Pigeon English,  like 'nigger' dialect, blurred and mangled distortions. He dared  accost no one with questions. The impression the people gave him jarred  altogether with his preconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the  old man's faith in Ostrog. It was only slowly he could bring himself  to believe that all these people were rejoicing at the defeat of the  Council, that the Council which had pursued him with such power and  vigour was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict. And if  that was so, how did it affect him? Several times he hesitated on the  verge of fundamental questions. Once he turned and walked for a long  way after a little man of rotund inviting outline, but he was unable to  master confidence to address him.    It was only slowly that it came to him that"]]]
