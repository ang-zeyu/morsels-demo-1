The greater part of the furniture, &c. in the palace of the  _Tuileries_ was sold in the spring of 1793. The sale lasted six  months, and, had it not been stopped, would have continued six months  longer. Some of the king's dress-suits which had cost twelve hundred  louis fetched no more than five. By the inventory taken immediately  after the 10th of August 1792, and laid before the Legislative  Assembly, it appears that the moveables of every description  contained in this palace were valued at 12,540,158 livres (_circa_  £522,560 sterling,) in which was included the amount of the thefts,  committed on that day, estimated at 1,000,000 livres, and that of the  dilapidations, at the like sum, making together about £84,000  sterling.    When Catherine de Medicis inhabited the palace of the _Tuileries_, it  was connected to the _Louvre_ by a garden, in the middle of which was  a large pond, always well stocked with fish for the supply of the  royal table. Lewis XIV transformed this garden into a spacious square  or _place_, where in the year 1662, he gave to the queen dowager and  his royal consort a magnificent fête, at which, were assembled  princes, lords, and knights, with their ladies, from every part of  Europe. Hence the square was named    PLACE DU CARROUSEL.    Previously to the revolution, the palace of the _Tuileries_, on this  side, was defended by a wall, pierced by three gates opening into as  many courts, separated by little buildings, which, in part, served  for lodging a few troops and their horses. All these buildings are  taken down; the _Place du Carrousel_ is considerably enlarged by the  demolition of various circumjacent edifices; and the wall is replaced  by a handsome iron railing, fixed on a parapet about four feet high.  In this railing are three gates, the centre one of which is  surmounted by cocks, holding in their beak a civic crown over the  letters R. F. the initials of the words _République Française_. On  each side of it are small lodges, built of stone; and at the entrance  are constantly posted two _vedettes_, belonging to the  horse-grenadiers of the consular guard.    On the piers of the other two gates are placed the four famous horses  of gilt bronze, brought from St. Mark's place at Venice, whither they  had been carried after the capture of Byzantium. These productions  are generally ascribed to the celebrated Lysippus, who flourished in  the reign of Alexander the Great, about 325 years before the  christian era; though this opinion is questioned by some distguished  antiquaries and artists. Whoever may be the sculptor, their destiny  is of a nature to fix attention, as their removal has always been the  consequence of a political revolution. After, the conquest of Greece  by the Romans, they were transported from Corinth to Rome, for the  purpose of adorning the triumphal arch of Septimius Severus. Hence  they were removed to Byzantium, when that city became the seat of the  eastern empire. From Byzantium, they were conveyed to Venice, and  from Venice they have at last reached Paris.    As on the plain of Pharsalia the fate of Rome was decided by Cæsar's  triumph over Pompey, so on the _Place du Carrousel_ the fate of  France by the triumph of the Convention over Robespierre and his  satellites. Here, Henriot, one of his most devoted creatures, whom he  had raised to the situation of commandant general of the Parisian  guard, after having been carried prisoner before the Committee of  Public Safety, then sitting in the palace of the _Tuileries_, was  released by Coffinhal, the President of the Revolutionary Tribunal,  who suddenly made his appearance at the head of a large body of horse  and foot, supported by four pieces of cannon served by gunners the  most devoted to Robespierre.    It was half past seven o'clock in the evening, where Coffinhal,  decorated with his municipal scarf, presented himself before the  Committee: all the members thought themselves lost, and their fright  communicating to the very bosom of the Convention, there spread  confusion and terror. But Coffinhal's presence of mind was not equal  to his courage: he availed himself only in part of his advantage.  After having, without the slightest resistance, disarmed the guards  attached to the Convention, he loosened the fettered hands of Henriot  and his aides-de-camp, and conducted them straight to the _Maison  Commune_.    It is an incontestable fact that had either Coffinhal or Henriot  imitated the conduct of Cromwell in regard to the Levellers, and  marched at the head of their troops into the hall of the Convention,  he might have carried all before him, and Robespierre's tyranny would  have been henceforth established on a basis not to be shaken.    But, when Henriot soon after appeared on the _Place du Carrousel_,  with his staff and a number of followers, he in vain endeavoured by  haranguing the people to stir them up to act against the Convention;  his voice was drowned in tumultuous clamours, and he was deserted by  his hitherto-faithful gunners. The Convention had had time to recover  from their panic, and to enlighten the Sections. Henriot was outlawed  by that assembly, and, totally disconcerted by this news, he fled for  refuge to the _Maison Commune_, where Robespierre and all his  accomplices were soon surrounded, and fell into the hands of those  whom but an instant before, they had proscribed as conspirators  deserving of the most exemplary punishment.    Henriot, confused and terrified, sought his safety in flight, and was  stealing along one of the galleries of the _Maison Commune_ when he  met Coffinhal, who was also flying. At the sight of Henriot, who on  coming from the Committee, had pledged his life on the success of his  measures, Coffinhal was unable to check his rage. \"Coward!\" said he  to him, \"to this then has led your certain means of defence!  Scoundrel! you shall not escape the death you are endeavouring to  avoid!\" Saying these words, he seized Henriot by the middle, and  threw him out of a window of the second story of the _Maison  Commune_. Henriot falling on the roof of a building in a narrow  street adjoining, was not killed; but he had scarcely recovered  himself before he was recognized by some soldiers in quest of him: he  then crawled into a sewer, close to the spot where he had fallen;  when a soldier thrusting his bayonet into the sewer, put out one of  his eyes, and forced him to surrender.    Thus, the destiny of France, as is seen, hung by the thread of the  moment. It will be recollected that Henriot had the arsenal at his  disposal; he commanded the Parisian guard, and six thousand men  encamped on the _Plaine des Sablons_, close to the capital: in a  word, all the springs of the public force were in his hands. Had he  seized the critical minute, and attacked the Convention at the  instant of his release, the scene of the 10th of August would have  been renewed, and the _Place du Carrousel_ again stained with the  blood of thousands.        LETTER XI.    _Paris, November 5, 1801._    I rise much later to-day than usual, in consequence of not having  gone to bed till near seven o'clock this morning. Happening to call  yesterday on a French lady of my acquaintance, I perceived some  preparations which announced that she expected company. She did not  leave me long in suspense, but invited me to her party for that  evening.    This good lady, who is no longer in the flower of her age, was still  in bed, though it was four o'clock when I paid my visit. On  expressing my fears that she was indisposed, she assured me of the  contrary, at the same time adding that she seldom rose till five in  the afternoon, on account of her being under the necessity of keeping  late hours. I was so struck by the expression, that I did not  hesitate to ask her what was the _necessity_ which compelled her to  make a practice of turning day into night? She very courteously gave  me a complete solution of this enigma, of which the following is the  substance.    \"During the reign of terror,\" said she, \"several of us _ci-devant  noblesse_ lost our nearest relatives, and with them our property,  which was either confiscated, or put under sequestration, so that we  were absolutely threatened by famine. When the prisoners were  massacred in September 1792, I left nothing unattempted to save the  life of my uncle and grandfather, who were both in confinement in the  _Abbaye_. All my efforts were unavailing. My interference served only  to exasperate their murderers and contributed, I fear, to accelerate  their death, which it was my misfortune to witness. Their inhuman  butchers, from whom I had patiently borne every species of insult,  went so far as to present to me, on the end of a pike, a human heart,  which had the appearance of having been broiled on the embers,  assuring me that, as it was the heart of my uncle, I might eat it  with safety.\"--Here an ejaculation, involuntarily escaping me,  interrupted her for a moment.    \"For my part,\" continued she, \"I was so overwhelmed by a conflict of  rage, despair, and grief, that I scarcely retained the use of my  senses. The excess of my horror deprived me of utterance.--What  little I was able to save from the wreck of my fortune, not affording  me sufficient means of subsistence, I was, however reluctantly, at  length compelled to adopt a plan of life, by which I saw other women,  in my forlorn situation, support a decent appearance. I therefore  hired suitable apartments, and twice in each decade, I receive  company. On one of these two nights I give a ball and supper, and on  the other, under the name of _société_, I have cards only.    \"Having a numerous circle of female acquaintance,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#19)"],[1,"neck  as the broad shoulders rose in a characteristic attitude of preparation  for attack.  As the ape's fingers were about to close upon the girl's  arm the youth rose suddenly with a short, vicious growl.  A clenched  fist flew before Meriem's eyes to land full upon the snout of the  astonished Akut.  With an explosive bellow the anthropoid reeled  backward and tumbled from the tree.    Korak stood glaring down upon him when a sudden swish in the bushes  close by attracted his attention.  The girl too was looking down; but  she saw nothing but the angry ape scrambling to his feet.  Then, like a  bolt from a cross bow, a mass of spotted, yellow fur shot into view  straight for Akut's back.  It was Sheeta, the leopard.          Chapter 10      As the leopard leaped for the great ape Meriem gasped in surprise and  horror--not for the impending fate of the anthropoid, but at the act of  the youth who but an instant before had angrily struck his strange  companion; for scarce had the carnivore burst into view than with drawn  knife the youth had leaped far out above him, so that as Sheeta was  almost in the act of sinking fangs and talons in Akut's broad back The  Killer landed full upon the leopard's shoulders.    The cat halted in mid air, missed the ape by but a hair's breadth, and  with horrid snarlings rolled over upon its back, clutching and clawing  in an effort to reach and dislodge the antagonist biting at its neck  and knifing it in the side.    Akut, startled by the sudden rush from his rear, and following hoary  instinct, was in the tree beside the girl with an agility little short  of marvelous in so heavy a beast.  But the moment that he turned to see  what was going on below him brought him as quickly to the ground again.  Personal differences were quickly forgotten in the danger which menaced  his human companion, nor was he a whit less eager to jeopardize his own  safety in the service of his friend than Korak had been to succor him.    The result was that Sheeta presently found two ferocious creatures  tearing him to ribbons.  Shrieking, snarling and growling, the three  rolled hither and thither among the underbrush, while with staring eyes  the sole spectator of the battle royal crouched trembling in the tree  above them hugging Geeka frantically to her breast.    It was the boy's knife which eventually decided the battle, and as the  fierce feline shuddered convulsively and rolled over upon its side the  youth and the ape rose and faced one another across the prostrate  carcass.  Korak jerked his head in the direction of the little girl in  the tree.    \"Leave her alone,\" he said; \"she is mine.\"    Akut grunted, blinked his blood-shot eyes, and turned toward the body  of Sheeta.  Standing erect upon it he threw out his great chest, raised  his face toward the heavens and gave voice to so horrid a scream that  once again the little girl shuddered and shrank.  It was the victory  cry of the bull ape that has made a kill.  The boy only looked on for a  moment in silence; then he leaped into the tree again to the girl's  side.  Akut presently rejoined them.  For a few minutes he busied  himself licking his wounds, then he wandered off to hunt his breakfast.    For many months the strange life of the three went on unmarked by any  unusual occurrences.  At least without any occurrences that seemed  unusual to the youth or the ape; but to the little girl it was a  constant nightmare of horrors for days and weeks, until she too became  accustomed to gazing into the eyeless sockets of death and to the feel  of the icy wind of his shroud-like mantle.  Slowly she learned the  rudiments of the only common medium of thought exchange which her  companions possessed--the language of the great apes.  More quickly she  perfected herself in jungle craft, so that the time soon came when she  was an important factor in the chase, watching while the others slept,  or helping them to trace the spoor of whatever prey they might be  stalking.  Akut accepted her on a footing which bordered upon equality  when it was necessary for them to come into close contact; but for the  most part he avoided her.  The youth always was kind to her, and if  there were many occasions upon which he felt the burden of her presence  he hid it from her.  Finding that the night damp and chill caused her  discomfort and even suffering, Korak constructed a tight little shelter  high among the swaying branches of a giant tree.  Here little Meriem  slept in comparative warmth and safety, while The Killer and the ape  perched upon near-by branches, the former always before the entrance to  the lofty domicile, where he best could guard its inmate from the  dangers of arboreal enemies.  They were too high to feel much fear of  Sheeta; but there was always Histah, the snake, to strike terror to  one's soul, and the great baboons who lived near-by, and who, while  never attacking always bared their fangs and barked at any of the trio  when they passed near them.    After the construction of the shelter the activities of the three  became localized.  They ranged less widely, for there was always the  necessity of returning to their own tree at nightfall.  A river flowed  near by.  Game and fruit were plentiful, as were fish also.  Existence  had settled down to the daily humdrum of the wild--the search for food  and the sleeping upon full bellies.  They looked no further ahead than  today.  If the youth thought of his past and of those who longed for  him in the distant metropolis it was in a detached and impersonal sort  of way as though that other life belonged to another creature than  himself.  He had given up hope of returning to civilization, for since  his various rebuffs at the hands of those to whom he had looked for  friendship he had wandered so far inland as to realize that he was  completely lost in the mazes of the jungle.    Then, too, since the coming of Meriem he had found in her that one  thing which he had most missed before in his savage, jungle life--human  companionship.  In his friendship for her there was appreciable no  trace of sex influence of which he was cognizant.  They were  friends--companions--that was all.  Both might have been boys, except  for the half tender and always masterful manifestation of the  protective instinct which was apparent in Korak's attitude.    The little girl idolized him as she might have idolized an indulgent  brother had she had one.  Love was a thing unknown to either; but as  the youth neared manhood it was inevitable that it should come to him  as it did to every other savage, jungle male.    As Meriem became proficient in their common language the pleasures of  their companionship grew correspondingly, for now they could converse  and aided by the mental powers of their human heritage they amplified  the restricted vocabulary of the apes until talking was transformed  from a task into an enjoyable pastime.  When Korak hunted, Meriem  usually accompanied him, for she had learned the fine art of silence,  when silence was desirable.  She could pass through the branches of the  great trees now with all the agility and stealth of The Killer himself.  Great heights no longer appalled her.  She swung from limb to limb, or  she raced through the mighty branches, surefooted, lithe, and fearless.  Korak was very proud of her, and even old Akut grunted in approval  where before he had growled in contempt.    A distant village of blacks had furnished her with a mantle of fur and  feathers, with copper ornaments, and weapons, for Korak would not  permit her to go unarmed, or unversed in the use of the weapons he  stole for her.  A leather thong over one shoulder supported the ever  present Geeka who was still the recipient of her most sacred  confidences.  A light spear and a long knife were her weapons of  offense or defense.  Her body, rounding into the fulness of an early  maturity, followed the lines of a Greek goddess; but there the  similarity ceased, for her face was beautiful.    As she grew more accustomed to the jungle and the ways of its wild  denizens fear left her.  As time wore on she even hunted alone when  Korak and Akut were prowling at a great distance, as they were  sometimes forced to do when game was scarce in their immediate  vicinity.  Upon these occasions she usually confined her endeavors to  the smaller animals though sometimes she brought down a deer, and once  even Horta, the boar--a great tusker that even Sheeta might have  thought twice before attacking.    In their stamping grounds in the jungle the three were familiar  figures.  The little monkeys knew them well, often coming close to  chatter and frolic about them.  When Akut was by, the small folk kept  their distance, but with Korak they were less shy and when both the  males were gone they would come close to Meriem, tugging at her  ornaments or playing with Geeka, who was a never ending source of  amusement to them.  The girl played with them and fed them, and when  she was alone they helped her to pass the long hours until Korak's  return.    Nor were they worthless as friends.  In the hunt they helped her locate  her quarry.  Often they would come racing through the trees to her side  to announce the near presence of antelope or giraffe, or with excited  warnings of the proximity of Sheeta or Numa.  Luscious, sun-kissed  fruits which hung far out upon the frail bough of the jungle's waving  crest were brought to her by these tiny, nimble allies.  Sometimes they  played tricks upon her; but she was always kind and gentle with them  and in their wild, half-human way they were kind to her and  affectionate.  Their language being similar to that of the great apes  Meriem could converse with them though the poverty of their vocabulary  rendered these exchanges anything but feasts of reason.  For familiar  objects they had names, as well as for those conditions which induced  pain or pleasure, joy, sorrow, "]]]
