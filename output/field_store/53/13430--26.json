This  inconvenience is quite grave, for it often happens that a needle changes  magnetic intensity, either under the influence of too strong currents  sent into the apparatus, or of other magnets in its vicinity, or as  a consequence of the bad quality of the steel, etc. It was therefore  urgently required that this should be remedied, and from this point  of view the new mode of winding the wire is an important improvement  introduced into medical galvanometers.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SUSPENSION OF LIFE.      Every one knows that life exists in a latent state in the seeds of  plants, and may be preserved therein, so to speak, indefinitely. In  1853, Ridolfi deposited in the Egyptian Museum of Florence a sheaf of  wheat that he had obtained from seeds found in a mummy case dating back  about 3,000 years. This aptitude of revivification is found to a high  degree in animalcules of low order. The air which we breathe is loaded  with impalpable dust that awaits, for ages perhaps, proper conditions  of heat and moisture to give it an ephemeral life that it will lose and  acquire by turns.    In 1707, Spallanzani found it possible, eleven times in succession, to  suspend the life of rotifers submitted to desiccation, and to call it  back again by moistening this organic dust with water. A few years  ago Doyere brought to life some tardigrades that had been dried at a  temperature of 150 deg. and kept four weeks in a vacuum. If we ascend the  scale of beings, we find analogous phenomena produced by diverse causes.  Flies that have been imported in casks of Madeira have been resuscitated  in Europe, and chrysalids have been kept in this state for years.  Cockchafers drowned, and then dried in the sun, have been revived after  a lapse of twenty-four hours, two days, and even five days, after  submersion. Frogs, salamanders, and spiders poisoned by curare or  nicotine, have returned to life after several days of apparent death.    Cold produces some extraordinary effects. Spallanzani kept several frogs  in the center of a lump of ice for two years, and, although they became  dry, rigid, almost friable, and gave no external appearance of being  alive, it was only necessary to expose them to a gradual and moderate  heat to put an end to the lethargic state in which they lay.    Pikes and salamanders have at different epochs been revived before the  eyes of Maupertuis and Constant Dumeril (members of the Academy of  Sciences) after being frozen stiff. Auguste Dumeril, son of Constant,  and who was the reporter of the committee relative to the Blois toad in  1851, published a curious memoir the following year in which he narrates  how he interrupted life through congelation of the liquids and solids of  the organism. Some frogs, whose internal temperature had been reduced to  -2 deg. in an atmosphere of -12 deg., returned to life before his eyes, and he  observed their tissues regain their usual elasticity and their heart  pass from absolute immobility to its normal motion.    There is therefore no reason for doubting the assertions of travelers  who tell us that the inhabitants of North America and Russia transport  fish that are frozen stiff, and bring them to life again by dipping them  into water of ordinary temperature ten or fifteen days afterward. But I  think too much reliance should not be put in the process devised by  the great English physiologist, Hunter, for prolonging the life of man  indefinitely by successive freezings. It has been allowed to no one but  a romancer, Mr. Edmond About, to be present at this curious operation.    Among the mammifera we find appearances of death in their winter sleep;  but these are incomplete, since the temperature of hibernating animals  remains greater by one degree than that of the surrounding air, and the  motions of the heart and respiration are simply retarded. Dr. Preyer has  observed that a hamster sometimes goes five minutes without breathing  appreciably after a fortnight's sleep.    In man himself a suspension of life, or at least phenomena that seem  inseparable therefrom, has been observed many times. In the _Journal des  Savants_ for 1741 we read that a Col. Russel, having witnessed the  death of his wife, whom he tenderly loved, did not wish her buried, and  threatened to kill any one who should attempt to remove the body before  he witnessed its decomposition himself. Eight days passed by without the  woman giving the slightest sign of life, \"when, at a moment when he was  holding her hand and shedding tears over her, the church bell began to  ring, and, to his indescribable surprise, his wife sat up and said, 'It  is the last stroke, we shall be too late.' She recovered.\"    At a session of the Academy of Sciences, Oct. 17, 1864, Mr. Blaudet  communicated a report upon a young woman of thirty summers who, being  subject to nervous attacks, fell, after her crises, into a sort of  lethargic sleep which lasted several weeks and sometimes several months.  One of her sleeps, especially, lasted from the beginning of the year  1862 until March, 1863.    Dr. Paul Levasseur relates that, in a certain English family, lethargy  seemed to have become hereditary. The first case was exhibited in an old  lady who remained for fifteen days in an immovable and insensible state,  and who afterward, on regaining her consciousness, lived for quite a  long time. Warned by this fact, the family preserved a young man for  several weeks who appeared to be dead, but who came to life again.    Dr. Pfendler, in an inaugural thesis (Paris, 1833), minutely describes a  case of apparent death of which he himself was a witness. A young girl  of Vienna at the age of 15 was attacked by a nervous affection that  brought on violent crises followed by lethargic states which lasted  three or four days. After a time she became so exhausted that the first  physicians of the city declared that there was no more hope. It was not  long, in fact, before she was observed to rise in her bed and fall back  as if struck with death. \"For four hours she appeared to me,\" says Dr.  Pfendler, \"completely inanimate. With Messrs. Franck and Schaeffer,  I made every possible effort to rekindle the spark of life. Neither  mirror, nor burned feather, nor ammonia, nor pricking succeeded in  giving us a sign of sensibility. Galvanism was tried without the patient  showing any contractility. Mr. Franck believed her to be dead, but  nevertheless advised me to leave her on the bed. For twenty-eight hours  no change supervened, although it was thought that a little putrefaction  was observed. The death bell was sounded, the friends of the girl had  dressed her in white and had crowned her with flowers, and all was  arranged for her burial. Desiring to convince myself of the course of  the putrefaction, I visited the body again, and found that no further  advance had been made than before. What was my astonishment when I  believed that I saw a slight respiratory motion. I looked again, and saw  that I was not mistaken. I at once used friction and irritants, and in  an hour and a half the respiration increased. The patient opened her  eyes, and, struck with the funereal paraphernalia around her, returned  to consciousness, and said, 'I am too young to die.'\" All this was  followed by a ten hours' sleep. Convalescence proceeded rapidly, and the  girl became free from all her nervous troubles. During her crisis she  heard everything. She quoted some Latin words that Mr. Franck had used.  Her most fearful agony had been to hear the preparations for her burial  without being able to get rid of her torpor. Medical dictionaries are  full of anecdotes of this nature, but I shall cite but two more.    On the 10th of November, 1812, during the fatal retreat from Russia,  Commandant Tascher, desiring to bring back to France the body of his  general, who had been killed by a bullet, and who had been buried since  the day before, disinterred him, and, upon putting him into a landau,  and noticing that he was still breathing, brought him to life again by  dint of care. A long time afterward this same general was one of the  pall bearers at the funeral obsequies of the aide-de-camp who had buried  him. In 1826 a young priest returned to life at the moment the bishop  of the diocese was pronouncing the _De Profundis_ over his body. Forty  years afterward, this priest, who had become Cardinal Donnett, preached  a feeling sermon upon the danger of premature burial.    I trust I have now sufficiently prepared the mind of the reader for an  examination of the phenomena of the voluntary suspension of life that I  shall now treat of.    The body of an animal may be compared to a machine that converts the  food that it receives into motion. It receives nothing, it will produce  nothing; but there is no reason why it should get out of order if it is  not deteriorated by external agents. The legendary rustic who wanted to  accustom his ass to go without food was therefore theoretically wrong  only because he at the same time wanted the animal to work. The whole  difficulty consists in breaking with old habits. To return to the  comparison that we just made, we shall run the risk of exploding the  boiler of a steam engine if we heat it or cool it abruptly, but we can  run it very slowly and for a very long time with but very little fuel.  We may even preserve a little fire under the ashes, and this, although  it may not be capable of setting the parts running, will suffice later  on to revivify the fireplace after it has been charged anew with fuel.    We have recently had the example of Dr. Tanner, who went forty days  without any other nourishment than water. Not very long ago Liedovine de  Schiedam, who had been bedridden for twenty years, affirmed that she  had taken no food for eight of them. It is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#19)"],[1,"ans, and of the result      My failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate my  secret to others of my household; yet neither was I led by it to  despair of success.  Only I saw that I must not wholly rely on the  catch-phrase, \"Upward, not Northward,\" but must rather endeavour to  seek a demonstration by setting before the public a clear view of the  whole subject; and for this purpose it seemed necessary to resort to  writing.    So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise  on the mysteries of Three Dimensions.  Only, with the view of evading  the Law, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a  Thoughtland whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland  and see simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was  possible that there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as  it were, with six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points.  But  in writing this book I found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility  of drawing such diagrams as were necessary for my purpose:  for of  course, in our country of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and  no diagrams but Lines, all in one straight Line and only  distinguishable by difference of size and brightness; so that, when I  had finished my treatise (which I entitled, \"Through Flatland to  Thoughtland\") I could not feel certain that many would understand my  meaning.    Meanwhile my wife was under a cloud.  All pleasures palled upon me; all  sights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason, because I could  not compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really was if  seen in Three, and could hardly refrain from making my comparisons  aloud.  I neglected my clients and my own business to give myself to  the contemplation of the mysteries which I had once beheld, yet which I  could impart to no one, and found daily more difficult to reproduce  even before my own mental vision.  One day, about eleven months after  my return from Spaceland, I tried to see a Cube with my eye closed, but  failed; and though I succeeded afterwards, I was not then quite certain  (nor have I been ever afterwards) that I had exactly realized the  original.  This made me more melancholy than before, and determined me  to take some step; yet what, I knew not.  I felt that I would have been  willing to sacrifice my life for the Cause, if thereby I could have  produced conviction.  But if I could not convince my Grandson, how  could I convince the highest and most developed Circles in the land?    And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent to  dangerous utterances.  Already I was considered heterodox if not  treasonable, and I was keenly alive to the danger of my position;  nevertheless I could not at times refrain from bursting out into  suspicious or half-seditious utterances, even among the highest  Polygonal or Circular society.  When, for example, the question arose  about the treatment of those lunatics who said that they had received  the power of seeing the insides of things, I would quote the saying of  an ancient Circle, who declared that prophets and inspired people are  always considered by the majority to be mad; and I could not help  occasionally dropping such expressions as \"the eye that discerns the  interiors of things,\" and \"the all-seeing land\"; once or twice I even  let fall the forbidden terms \"the Third and Fourth Dimensions.\" At  last, to complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of our  Local Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect  himself,--some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper  exhibiting the precise reasons why Providence has limited the number of  Dimensions to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence is assigned to  the Supreme alone--I so far forgot myself as to give an exact account  of the whole of my voyage with the Sphere into Space, and to the  Assembly Hall in our Metropolis, and then to Space again, and of my  return home, and of everything that I had seen and heard in fact or  vision.  At first, indeed, I pretended that I was describing the  imaginary experiences of a fictitious person; but my enthusiasm soon  forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent  peroration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice  and to become believers in the Third Dimension.    Need I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?    Next morning, standing in the very place where but a very few months  ago the Sphere had stood in my company, I was allowed to begin and to  continue my narration unquestioned and uninterrupted.  But from the  first I foresaw my fate; for the President, noting that a guard of the  better sort of Policemen was in attendance, of angularity little, if at  all, under 55 degrees, ordered them to be relieved before I began my  defence, by an inferior class of 2 or 3 degrees.  I knew only too well  what that meant.  I was to be executed or imprisoned, and my story was  to be kept secret from the world by the simultaneous destruction of the  officials who had heard it; and, this being the case, the President  desired to substitute the cheaper for the more expensive victims.    After I had concluded my defence, the President, perhaps perceiving  that some of the junior Circles had been moved by evident earnestness,  asked me two questions:--    1.  Whether I could indicate the direction which I meant when I used  the words \"Upward, not Northward\"?    2.  Whether I could by any diagrams or descriptions (other than the  enumeration of imaginary sides and angles) indicate the Figure I was  pleased to call a Cube?    I declared that I could say nothing more, and that I must commit myself  to the Truth, whose cause would surely prevail in the end.    The President replied that he quite concurred in my sentiment, and that  I could not do better.  I must be sentenced to perpetual imprisonment;  but if the Truth intended that I should emerge from prison and  evangelize the world, the Truth might be trusted to bring that result  to pass.  Meanwhile I should be subjected to no discomfort that was not  necessary to preclude escape, and, unless I forfeited the privilege by  misconduct, I should be occasionally permitted to see my brother who  had preceded me to my prison.    Seven years have elapsed and I am still a prisoner, and--if I except  the occasional visits of my brother--debarred from all companionship  save that of my jailers.  My brother is one of the best of Squares,  just, sensible, cheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I  confess that my weekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me  the bitterest pain.  He was present when the Sphere manifested himself  in the Council Chamber; he saw the Sphere's changing sections; he heard  the explanation of the phenomena then give to the Circles.  Since that  time, scarcely a week has passed during seven whole years, without his  hearing from me a repetition of the part I played in that  manifestation, together with ample descriptions of all the phenomena in  Spaceland, and the arguments for the existence of Solid things  derivable from Analogy.  Yet--I take shame to be forced to confess  it--my brother has not yet grasped the nature of Three Dimensions, and  frankly avows his disbelief in the existence of a Sphere.    Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that I can  see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing.  Prometheus up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire for  mortals, but I--poor Flatland Prometheus--lie here in prison for  bringing down nothing to my countrymen.  Yet I existing the hope that  these memoirs, in some manner, I know not how, may find their way to  the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and may stir up a race of  rebels who shall refuse to be confined to limited Dimensionality.    That is the hope of my brighter moments.  Alas, it is not always so.  Heavily weights on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot  honestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen,  oft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept,  \"Upward, not Northward,\" haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx.  It is  part of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of Truth that there  are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away into  the background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three  Dimensions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay,  when even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very  tablets on which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of  Flatland itself, appear no better than the offspring of a diseased  imagination, or the baseless fabric of a dream.      ***      PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION, 1884.  BY THE EDITOR      If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed  when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to  represent him in this preface, in which he desires, fully, to return  his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation  has, with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of this work;  secondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which,  however, he is not entirely responsible); and, thirdly, to explain one  or two misconceptions.  But he is not the Square he once was.  Years of  imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and  mockery, have combined with the thoughts and notions, and much also of  the terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in spaceland.  He has, therefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special  objections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.    The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line, sees  something that must be THICK to the eye as well as LONG to the eye  (otherwise it would"]]]
