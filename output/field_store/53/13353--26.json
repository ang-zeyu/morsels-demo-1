[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy â€” Complete (#19)"],[1,", I trust, with no slight gratitude and veneration to the  Disposer of human events, who guided my early course through much risk  and labour, that the ease with which he has blessed my prolonged life  might seem softer from remembrance and contrast. Neither is it possible  for me to doubt, what you have often affirmed, that the incidents which  befell me among a people singularly primitive in their government and  manners, have something interesting and attractive for those who love to  hear an old man's stories of a past age.    Still, however, you must remember, that the tale told by one friend, and  listened to by another, loses half its charms when committed to paper;  and that the narratives to which you have attended with interest, as  heard from the voice of him to whom they occurred, will appear less  deserving of attention when perused in the seclusion of your study. But  your greener age and robust constitution promise longer life than will,  in all human probability, be the lot of your friend. Throw, then, these  sheets into some secret drawer of your escritoire till we are separated  from each other's society by an event which may happen at any moment, and  which must happen within the course of a few--a very few years. When we  are parted in this world, to meet, I hope, in a better, you will, I am  well aware, cherish more than it deserves the memory of your departed  friend, and will find in those details which I am now to commit to paper,  matter for melancholy, but not unpleasing reflection. Others bequeath to  the confidants of their bosom portraits of their external features--I put  into your hands a faithful transcript of my thoughts and feelings, of my  virtues and of my failings, with the assured hope, that the follies and  headstrong impetuosity of my youth will meet the same kind construction  and forgiveness which have so often attended the faults of my matured  age.    One advantage, among the many, of addressing my Memoirs (if I may give  these sheets a name so imposing) to a dear and intimate friend, is, that  I may spare some of the details, in this case unnecessary, with which I  must needs have detained a stranger from what I have to say of greater  interest. Why should I bestow all my tediousness upon you, because I have  you in my power, and have ink, paper, and time before me? At the same  time, I dare not promise that I may not abuse the opportunity so  temptingly offered me, to treat of myself and my own concerns, even  though I speak of circumstances as well known to you as to myself. The  seductive love of narrative, when we ourselves are the heroes of the  events which we tell, often disregards the attention due to the time and  patience of the audience, and the best and wisest have yielded to its  fascination. I need only remind you of the singular instance evinced by  the form of that rare and original edition of Sully's Memoirs, which you  (with the fond vanity of a book-collector) insist upon preferring to that  which is reduced to the useful and ordinary form of Memoirs, but which I  think curious, solely as illustrating how far so great a man as the  author was accessible to the foible of self-importance. If I recollect  rightly, that venerable peer and great statesman had appointed no fewer  than four gentlemen of his household to draw up the events of his life,  under the title of Memorials of the Sage and Royal Affairs of State,  Domestic, Political, and Military, transacted by Henry IV., and so forth.  These grave recorders, having made their compilation, reduced the Memoirs  containing all the remarkable events of their master's life into a  narrative, addressed to himself in _propria persona._ And thus, instead  of telling his own story, in the third person, like Julius Caesar, or in  the first person, like most who, in the hall, or the study, undertake to  be the heroes of their own tale, Sully enjoyed the refined, though  whimsical pleasure, of having the events of his life told over to him by  his secretaries, being himself the auditor, as he was also the hero, and  probably the author, of the whole book. It must have been a great sight  to have seen the ex-minister, as bolt upright as a starched ruff and  laced cassock could make him, seated in state beneath his canopy, and  listening to the recitation of his compilers, while, standing bare in his  presence, they informed him gravely, \"Thus said the duke--so did the duke  infer--such were your grace's sentiments upon this important  point--such were your secret counsels to the king on that other  emergency,\"--circumstances, all of which must have been much better  known to their hearer than to themselves, and most of which could only  be derived from his own special communication.    My situation is not quite so ludicrous as that of the great Sully, and  yet there would be something whimsical in Frank Osbaldistone giving Will  Tresham a formal account of his birth, education, and connections in the  world. I will, therefore, wrestle with the tempting spirit of P. P.,  Clerk of our Parish, as I best may, and endeavour to tell you nothing  that is familiar to you already. Some things, however, I must recall to  your memory, because, though formerly well known to you, they may have  been forgotten through lapse of time, and they afford the ground-work of  my destiny.    You must remember my father well; for, as your own was a member of the  mercantile house, you knew him from infancy. Yet you hardly saw him in  his best days, before age and infirmity had quenched his ardent spirit of  enterprise and speculation. He would have been a poorer man, indeed, but  perhaps as happy, had he devoted to the extension of science those active  energies, and acute powers of observation, for which commercial pursuits  found occupation. Yet, in the fluctuations of mercantile speculation,  there is something captivating to the adventurer, even independent of the  hope of gain. He who embarks on that fickle sea, requires to possess the  skill of the pilot and the fortitude of the navigator, and after all may  be wrecked and lost, unless the gales of fortune breathe in his favour.  This mixture of necessary attention and inevitable hazard,--the frequent  and awful uncertainty whether prudence shall overcome fortune, or fortune  baffle the schemes of prudence, affords full occupation for the powers,  as well as for the feelings of the mind, and trade has all the  fascination of gambling without its moral guilt.    Early in the 18th century, when I (Heaven help me) was a youth of some  twenty years old, I was summoned suddenly from Bourdeaux to attend my  father on business of importance. I shall never forget our first  interview. You recollect the brief, abrupt, and somewhat stern mode in  which he was wont to communicate his pleasure to those around him.  Methinks I see him even now in my mind's eye;--the firm and upright  figure,--the step, quick and determined,--the eye, which shot so keen and  so penetrating a glance,--the features, on which care had already planted  wrinkles,--and hear his language, in which he never wasted word in vain,  expressed in a voice which had sometimes an occasional harshness, far  from the intention of the speaker.    When I dismounted from my post-horse, I hastened to my father's  apartment. He was traversing it with an air of composed and steady  deliberation, which even my arrival, although an only son unseen for four  years, was unable to discompose. I threw myself into his arms. He was a  kind, though not a fond father, and the tear twinkled in his dark eye,  but it was only for a moment.    \"Dubourg writes to me that he is satisfied with you, Frank.\"    \"I am happy, sir\"--    \"But I have less reason to be so\" he added, sitting down at his bureau.    \"I am sorry, sir\"--    \"Sorry and happy, Frank, are words that, on most occasions, signify  little or nothing--Here is your last letter.\"    He took it out from a number of others tied up in a parcel of red tape,  and curiously labelled and filed. There lay my poor epistle, written on  the subject the nearest to my heart at the time, and couched in words  which I had thought would work compassion if not conviction,--there, I  say, it lay, squeezed up among the letters on miscellaneous business in  which my father's daily affairs had engaged him. I cannot help smiling  internally when I recollect the mixture of hurt vanity, and wounded  feeling, with which I regarded my remonstrance, to the penning of which  there had gone, I promise you, some trouble, as I beheld it extracted  from amongst letters of advice, of credit, and all the commonplace  lumber, as I then thought them, of a merchant's correspondence. Surely,  thought I, a letter of such importance (I dared not say, even to myself,  so well written) deserved a separate place, as well as more anxious  consideration, than those on the ordinary business of the counting-house.    But my father did not observe my dissatisfaction, and would not have  minded it if he had. He proceeded, with the letter in his hand. \"This,  Frank, is yours of the 21st ultimo, in which you advise me (reading from  my letter), that in the most important business of forming a plan, and  adopting a profession for life, you trust my paternal goodness will hold  you entitled to at least a negative voice; that you have insuperable--ay,  insuperable is the word--I wish, by the way, you would write a more  distinct current hand--draw a score through the tops of your t's, and  open the loops of your l's--insuperable objections to the arrangements  which I have proposed to you. There is much more to the same effect,  occupying four good pages of paper, which a little attention to  perspicuity and distinctness of expression might have comprised within as  many lines. For, after all, Frank, it amounts but to this, that you will  not do as I would have you.\"    \"That I cannot, sir, in the present instance, not that I will not.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#19)"],[1,"of any desire to visit the more distant portions  of South America might feel the urge, so to speak, shortly after he  became a treasurer. That is my difficulty. Of course, one always takes  a sporting chance with any treasurer; but how am I to find out which of  these two men would give me the more reasonable opportunity of keeping  some of my money?\"    I did not hesitate a moment. I held strong views on the subject of  character-testing.    \"The only way,\" I said to Alexander, \"of really finding out a man's  true character is to play golf with him. In no other walk of life does  the cloven hoof so quickly display itself. I employed a lawyer for  years, until one day I saw him kick his ball out of a heel-mark. I  removed my business from his charge next morning. He has not yet run  off with any trust-funds, but there is a nasty gleam in his eye, and I  am convinced that it is only a question of time. Golf, my dear fellow,  is the infallible test. The man who can go into a patch of rough alone,  with the knowledge that only God is watching him, and play his ball  where it lies, is the man who will serve you faithfully and well. The  man who can smile bravely when his putt is diverted by one of those  beastly wormcasts is pure gold right through. But the man who is hasty,  unbalanced, and violent on the links will display the same qualities in  the wider field of everyday life. You don't want an unbalanced  treasurer do you?\"    \"Not if his books are likely to catch the complaint.\"    \"They are sure to. Statisticians estimate that the average of crime  among good golfers is lower than in any class of the community except  possibly bishops. Since Willie Park won the first championship at  Prestwick in the year 1860 there has, I believe, been no instance of an  Open Champion spending a day in prison. Whereas the bad golfers--and by  bad I do not mean incompetent, but black-souled--the men who fail to  count a stroke when they miss the globe; the men who never replace a  divot; the men who talk while their opponent is driving; and the men  who let their angry passions rise--these are in and out of Wormwood  Scrubbs all the time. They find it hardly worth while to get their hair  cut in their brief intervals of liberty.\"    Alexander was visibly impressed.    \"That sounds sensible, by George!\" he said.    \"It is sensible.\"    \"I'll do it! Honestly, I can't see any other way of deciding between  Holmes and Dixon.\"    I started.    \"Holmes? Not Mitchell Holmes?\"    \"Yes. Of course you must know him? He lives here, I believe.\"    \"And by Dixon do you mean Rupert Dixon?\"    \"That's the man. Another neighbour of yours.\"    I confess that my heart sank. It was as if my ball had fallen into the  pit which my niblick had digged. I wished heartily that I had thought  of waiting to ascertain the names of the two rivals before offering my  scheme. I was extremely fond of Mitchell Holmes and of the girl to whom  he was engaged to be married. Indeed, it was I who had sketched out a  few rough notes for the lad to use when proposing; and results had  shown that he had put my stuff across well. And I had listened many a  time with a sympathetic ear to his hopes in the matter of securing a  rise of salary which would enable him to get married. Somehow, when  Alexander was talking, it had not occurred to me that young Holmes  might be in the running for so important an office as the  treasurership. I had ruined the boy's chances. Ordeal by golf was the  one test which he could not possibly undergo with success. Only a  miracle could keep him from losing his temper, and I had expressly  warned Alexander against such a man.    When I thought of his rival my heart sank still more. Rupert Dixon was  rather an unpleasant young man, but the worst of his enemies could not  accuse him of not possessing the golfing temperament. From the drive  off the tee to the holing of the final putt he was uniformly suave.           *       *       *       *       *    When Alexander had gone, I sat in thought for some time. I was faced  with a problem. Strictly speaking, no doubt, I had no right to take  sides; and, though secrecy had not been enjoined upon me in so many  words, I was very well aware that Alexander was under the impression  that I would keep the thing under my hat and not reveal to either party  the test that awaited him. Each candidate was, of course, to remain  ignorant that he was taking part in anything but a friendly game.    But when I thought of the young couple whose future depended on this  ordeal, I hesitated no longer. I put on my hat and went round to Miss  Boyd's house, where I knew that Mitchell was to be found at this hour.    The young couple were out in the porch, looking at the moon. They  greeted me heartily, but their heartiness had rather a tinny sound, and  I could see that on the whole they regarded me as one of those things  which should not happen. But when I told my story their attitude  changed. They began to look on me in the pleasanter light of a  guardian, philosopher, and friend.    \"Wherever did Mr. Paterson get such a silly idea?\" said Miss Boyd,  indignantly. I had--from the best motives--concealed the source of the  scheme. \"It's ridiculous!\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Mitchell. \"The old boy's crazy about golf.  It's just the sort of scheme he would cook up. Well, it dishes  _me_!\"    \"Oh, come!\" I said.    \"It's no good saying 'Oh, come!' You know perfectly well that I'm a  frank, outspoken golfer. When my ball goes off nor'-nor'-east when I  want it to go due west I can't help expressing an opinion about it. It  is a curious phenomenon which calls for comment, and I give it.  Similarly, when I top my drive, I have to go on record as saying that I  did not do it intentionally. And it's just these trifles, as far as I  can make out, that are going to decide the thing.\"    \"Couldn't you learn to control yourself on the links, Mitchell,  darling?\" asked Millicent. \"After all, golf is only a game!\"    Mitchell's eyes met mine, and I have no doubt that mine showed just the  same look of horror which I saw in his. Women say these things without  thinking. It does not mean that there is any kink in their character.  They simply don't realize what they are saying.    \"Hush!\" said Mitchell, huskily, patting her hand and overcoming his  emotion with a strong effort. \"Hush, dearest!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Two or three days later I met Millicent coming from the post-office.  There was a new light of happiness in her eyes, and her face was  glowing.    \"Such a splendid thing has happened,\" she said. \"After Mitchell left  that night I happened to be glancing through a magazine, and I came  across a wonderful advertisement. It began by saying that all the great  men in history owed their success to being able to control themselves,  and that Napoleon wouldn't have amounted to anything if he had not  curbed his fiery nature, and then it said that we can all be like  Napoleon if we fill in the accompanying blank order-form for Professor  Orlando Rollitt's wonderful book, 'Are You Your Own Master?' absolutely  free for five days and then seven shillings, but you must write at once  because the demand is enormous and pretty soon it may be too late. I  wrote at once, and luckily I was in time, because Professor Rollitt did  have a copy left, and it's just arrived. I've been looking through it,  and it seems splendid.\"    She held out a small volume. I glanced at it. There was a frontispiece  showing a signed photograph of Professor Orlando Rollitt controlling  himself in spite of having long white whiskers, and then some reading  matter, printed between wide margins. One look at the book told me the  professor's methods. To be brief, he had simply swiped Marcus  Aurelius's best stuff, the copyright having expired some two thousand  years ago, and was retailing it as his own. I did not mention this to  Millicent. It was no affair of mine. Presumably, however obscure the  necessity, Professor Rollitt had to live.    \"I'm going to start Mitchell on it today. Don't you think this is good?  'Thou seest how few be the things which if a man has at his command his  life flows gently on and is divine.' I think it will be wonderful if  Mitchell's life flows gently on and is divine for seven shillings,  don't you?\"           *       *       *       *       *    At the club-house that evening I encountered Rupert Dixon. He was  emerging from a shower-bath, and looked as pleased with himself as  usual.    \"Just been going round with old Paterson,\" he said. \"He was asking  after you. He's gone back to town in his car.\"    I was thrilled. So the test had begun!    \"How did you come out?\" I asked.    Rupert Dixon smirked. A smirking man, wrapped in a bath towel, with a  wisp of wet hair over one eye, is a repellent sight.    \"Oh, pretty well. I won by six and five. In spite of having poisonous  luck.\"    I felt a gleam of hope at these last words.    \"Oh, you had bad luck?\"    \"The worst. I over-shot the green at the third with the best  brassey-shot I've ever made in my life--and that's saying a lot--and  lost my ball in the rough beyond it.\"    \"And I suppose you let yourself go, eh?\"    \"Let myself go?\"    \"I take it that you made some sort of demonstration?\"    \"Oh, no. Losing your temper doesn't get you anywhere at golf. It only  spoils your next shot.\"    I went away heavy-hearted. Dixon had plainly come through the ordeal as  well as any man could have done. I expected to hear every day that the  vacant treasurership had been filled, and that Mitchell had not even  been called upon to play his test round. I suppose, however, that  Alexander Paterson felt that it would be unfair to the other competitor  not to give him his chance, for the next I heard of the matter was when  Mitchell Holmes rang me up on the Friday and asked me if I would  accompany him round the links next day in the match"]]]
