A  great deal depends on our speed.\"    \"So it does on mine,\" was the reply. \"Ef I git t' market late I'll have  t' stay all night, an' spend money on a hotel bill.\"    \"I'll pay it! I'll pay your bill if you'll only pull out!\" cried Mr.  Damon. \"I'll give you a hundred dollars!\"    He suddenly ceased speaking. From the bushes along the road sprang  several ragged, masked figures. Each one, aiming his weapon at Tom,  said in a low voice, that could not have been heard by the driver of  the hay wagon:    \"Slow up your machine, young feller! We want to speak with you, and  don't you make a loud noise, or it won't be healthy for you!\"    \"Why of all the--!\" began Mr. Damon, but another of the footpads  leveling his weapon at the eccentric man growled:    \"Dry up, if you don't want to get shot!\"    Mr. Damon subsided. Discretion was very plainly the better part of  valor. Tom had shut off the current. The load of hay continued on  ahead. Tom thought perhaps the driver of it might have been in  collusion with the thieves, to cause the auto to slow up.    \"What do you want with us?\" asked the young inventor, trying to speak  calmly, but finding it a hard task, with a revolver pointed at him.    \"You know what we want,\" exclaimed the leader, in a low voice.  \"We  want that cash you got from the bank, and we're going to have it! Come,  now, shell out!\" and he advanced toward the automobile.          CHAPTER XX    ON TIME      Close around the electric auto crowded the members of the hold-up gang.  Their eyes seemed to glare through the holes in their black masks.  Instantly Tom thought of the other occasion when he was halted by  masked figures. Could these, by any possibility, be the same  individuals? Was this a trick of Andy Foger and his cronies?    Tom tried to pierce through the disguises. Clearly the persons were  men--not boys--and they wore the ragged clothes of tramps.  Also, there  was an air of dogged determination about them.    \"Well, are you going to shell out?\" asked the leader, taking a step  nearer, \"or will we have to take it?\"    \"Bless my very existence! You don't mean to say that you're going to  take the money--I mean how do you know we have any money?\" and Mr.  Damon hastily corrected himself. \"What right have you to stop us in  this way? Don't you know that every minute counts? We are in a hurry.\"    \"I know it,\" spoke the leading masked figure with a laugh. \"I know you  have considerable money in that shebang, and I know what you hope to do  with it, prevent the run on the Shopton National Bank. But we need that  money as much as some other people and, what's more, we're going to  have it! Come on, shell out!\"    \"Oh, why didn't we bring a gun!\" lamented Mr. Damon in a low voice to  Tom. \"Isn't there anything we can do? Can't you give them an electric  shock, Tom?\"    \"I'm afraid not. If it wasn't for that hay wagon we could turn on the  current and make a run for it. But we'd only go into the ditch if we  tried to pass now.\"    The load of hay was down the road, but as Tom looked he noticed a  curious thing. It seemed to be nearer than it was when the attack of  the masked men came. The wagon actually seemed to have backed up. Once  more the thought came to the lad that possibly the load of fodder might  be one of the factors on which the thieves counted. They might have  used it to make the auto halt, and the man, or men, on it were probably  in collusion with the footpads. There was no doubt about it, the load  of hay was coming nearer, backing up instead of moving away. Tom  couldn't understand it. He gave a swift glance at the robbers. They had  not appeared to notice this, or, if they had, they gave no sign.    \"Then we can't do anything,\" murmured Mr. Damon.    \"I don't see that we can,\" replied the young inventor in a low voice.    \"And the money we worked so hard to get won't do the bank any good,\"  and Mr. Damon sighed.    \"It's tough luck,\" agreed Tom.    \"Come now, fork over that cash!\" called the leader, advancing still  closer. \"None of that talk between you there. If you think you can work  some trick on us you're mistaken. We're desperate men, and we're well  armed. The first show of resistance you make, and we shoot--get that,  fellows?\" he added to his followers, and they nodded grimly.    \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Damon with an air of submission, \"I only want to  warn you that you are acting illegally, and that you are perpetrating a  desperate crime.\"    \"Oh, we know that all right,\" answered one of the men, and Tom gave a  start. He was sure he had heard that voice before. He tried to remember  it--tried to penetrate the disguise--but he could not.    \"I'll give you ten seconds more to hand over that bag of money,\" went  on the leader. \"If you don't, we'll take it and some of you may get  hurt in the process.\"    There seemed nothing else to do. With a white face, but with anger  showing in his eyes Mr. Damon reached down to get the valise. Tom had  retained his grip of the steering wheel, and the starting lever. He  hoped, at the last minute, he might see a chance to dash away, and  escape, but that load of hay was in the path. He noted that it was now  quite near, but the thieves paid no attention to it.    Tom might have reversed the power, and sent his machine backward, but  he could not see to steer it if he went in that direction, and he would  soon have gone into the ditch. There was nothing to do save to hand  over the cash, it seemed.    Mr. Damon had the bag raised from the car, and the leader of the  thieves was reaching up for it, when there came a sudden interruption.    From the load of hay there sounded a fusillade of pistol shots,  cracking out with viciousness. This was instantly followed by the  appearance of three men who came running from around the load of hay,  down the road toward the thieves. Each man carried a pitchfork, and as  they ran, one of the trio shouted:    \"Right at 'em, boys! Jab your hay forks clean through the scoundrels!  By Heck, I guess we'll show 'em we know how t' tackle a hold-up gang as  well as the next fellow! Right at 'em now!  Charge 'em! Stick your  forks right through 'em!\"  Again there sounded a fusillade of pistol  shots.    The thieves turned as one man, and glanced at the relief so  unexpectedly approaching. They gave one look at the three determined  looking farmers, with their sharp, glittering pitchforks, and then,  without a word, they turned and fled, leaping into the bushes that  lined the roadway. The underbrush closed after them and they were  hidden from sight.    On came the three farmers, waving their effective weapons, the pistol  shots still ringing out from the load of hay. Tom could not understand  it, and could see no one firing--could detect no smoke.    \"Are they gone? Did they rob ye?\" asked the foremost of the trio, a  burly, grizzled farmer. \"Bust my buttons, but I guess we skeered 'em  all right!\"    \"Bless my shoe buttons, but you certainly have!\" cried Mr. Damon,  descending from the automobile, and wringing the hand of the farmer,  while Tom, thrust the bag of money under his legs and waited further  developments. The pistol shots rang out until one of the men called:    \"That'll do, Bub! We've skeered 'em like Mrs. Zenoby's pet cat!  You  needn't crack that whip any more.\"    \"Whip!\" cried Tom. \"Was that a whip?\"    \"That's what it was,\" explained the leading farmer. \"Bub Armstrong, my  nephew, can crack it to beat th' band,\" and as if in proof of this  there emerged from behind the load of hay a small lad, carrying a large  whip, to which he gave a few trial cracks, like pistol shots, as if to  show his ability.    \"It's all right, Bub,\" his uncle assured him. \"We made 'em run.\"    \"But I don't exactly understand,\" spoke Mr. Damon. \"I thought you were  in league with those thieves, stopping us as you did with your big  load.\"    \"So did I,\" admitted Tom.    \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the farmer. \"That's a pretty good joke.  Excuse me  for laughin'. My name's Lyon, Jethro Lyon, of Salina Township, an'  these is my two sons, Ade and Burt. You see we're on our way to  Shopton, an' my nephew, Bub, he went along. We thought you was some of  them sassy automobile fellers at first when you hollered to us you  wanted to pass. Then when we looked back, we seen them burglars goin'  t' rob you, at least that's what we suspicioned,\" and he paused  suggestively.    \"That was it,\" Tom said.    \"Wa'al, when we seen that, we held a sort of consultation on thet load  of hay, where they couldn't see us. It was so big you know,\" he  needlessly explained. \"Wa'al, we calcalated we could help you, so I  jest quietly backed up, until we was near enough.  I told Bub to take  the long whip, an' crack it for all he was wuth, so's it would sound  like reinforcements approachin' with guns, an' he done it.\"    \"He certainly done it,\" added Burt.    \"Wa'al,\" resumed Mr. Lyon, \"then me an my sons we jest slipped down off  the front seat, an' come a runnin' with our pitchforks.  I reckoned  them burglars would run when they see us an' heard us, an' they done  so.\"    \"Yep, they done so,\" added Ade, like an echo.    \"I can't tell you how much obliged we are to you,\" said Mr. Damon. \"We  have sixty thousand dollars in this valise, and they would have had it  in another minute, and the bank would have failed.\"    \"Sixty thousand dollars!\" gasped Mr. Lyon, and his sons and nephew  echoed the words. Mr. Damon briefly explained about the money, and he  and the young inventor again thanked their rescuers, who had so  unexpectedly, and in such a novel manner, put the thieves to flight.    \"An' you've got t' git t' Shopton before three o'clock with thet cash?\"  asked Mr. Lyon.    \"That's what we hoped to do,\" replied Tom \"but I'm afraid we won't now.  It's half past two, and--\"    \"Don't say another word,\" interrupted Mr. Lyon. \"I know what ye mean.  My hay's in the road. But don't let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#19)"],[1," harder and was not so easily  shattered. Tom made tests of the pieces he had obtained from the  outcropping ledge on the mountain where he had shot the condor, and  decided to make a change in the powder.    Shipments were regularly received from Shopton, Mr. Swift keeping  things in progress there. Mr. Damon's business was going on  satisfactorily, and he lent what aid he could to Tom. As for Professor  Bumper he kept on with his search for the lost city of Pelone, but with  no success.    The scientist wanted Tom and Mr. Damon to go on another trip with him,  this time to a distant sierra, or fertile valley, where it was reported  a race of Indians lived, different from others in that region.    \"It may be that they are descendants from the Pelonians,\" suggested the  professor. Tom was too busy to go, but Mr. Damon went. The expedition  had all sorts of trouble, losing its way and getting into a swamp from  which escape was not easy. Then, too, the strange Indians proved  hostile, and the professor and his party could not get nearer than the  boundaries of the valley.    \"But the difficulties and the hostile attitude of these natives only  makes me surer that I am on the right track,\" said Mr. Bumper. \"I shall  try again.\"    Tom was busy over a problem in explosives one day when he saw Tim  Sullivan hurrying into the office of the two brothers. The Irishman  seemed excited.    \"I hope there hasn't been another premature blast,\" mused Tom. \"But if  there had been I think I'd have heard it.\"    He hastened out to see Job and Walter Titus in excited conversation  with Tim.    \"They didn't come out, an' thot's all there is to it,\" the foreman was  saying. \"I sint thim in mesilf, and they worked until it was time t'  set off th' blast. I wint t' get th' fuse, an' I was goin' t' send th'  black imps out of danger, whin--whist--they was gone whin I got  back--fifteen of 'em this time!\"    \"Do you mean that fifteen more of our men have vanished as the first  ten did?\" asked Job Titus.    \"That's what I mean,\" asserted the Irishman.    \"It can't be!\" declared Walter.    \"Look for yersilf!\" returned Tim. \"They're not in th' tunnel!\"    \"And they didn't come out?\"    \"Ask th' time-keeper,\" and Tim motioned to a young Englishman who,  since the other disappearance, had been stationed at the mouth of the  tunnel to keep a record of who went in and came out.    \"No, sir! Nobody kime hout, sir!\" the Englishman declared.  \"Hi 'aven't  been away frim 'ere, sir, not since hi wint on duty, sir. An' no one  kime out, no, sir!\"    \"We've got to stop this!\" declared Job Titus.    \"I should say so!\" agreed his brother.    With Tom and Tim the Titus brothers went into the tunnel.  It was  deserted, and not a trace of the men could be found.  Their tools were  where they had been dropped, but of the men not a sign.    \"There must be some secret way out,\" declared Tom.    \"Then we'll find it,\" asserted the brothers.    Work on the tunnel was stopped for a day, and, keeping out all natives,  the contractors, with Tom and such white men as they had in their  employ, went over every foot of roof, sides and floor in the big shaft.  But not a crack or fissure, large enough to permit the passage of a  child, much less a man, could be found.    \"Well, I give up!\" cried Walter Titus in despair. \"There must be  witchcraft at work here!\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed his brother. \"It's more likely the craft of  Blakeson & Grinder, with Waddington helping them.\"    \"Well, if a human agency made these twenty-five men disappear, prove  it!\" insisted Walter.    His brother did not know what to say.    \"Well, go on with the work,\" was Job's final conclusion.  \"We'll have  one of the white men constantly in the tunnel after this whenever a  gang is working. We won't leave the natives alone even long enough to  go to get a fuse. They'll be under constant supervision.\"    The tunnel was opened for work, but there were no workers.  The morning  after the investigation, when the starting whistle blew there was no  line of Indians ready to file into the big, black hole. The huts where  they slept were deserted. A strange silence brooded over the tunnel  camp.    \"Where are the men, Serato?\" asked Tom of the Indian foreman.    \"Men um gone. No work any more. What you call a hit.\"    \"You mean a strike?\" asked Tom.    \"Sure--strike--hit--all um same. No more work--um 'fraid!\"          Chapter XIX    A Woman Tells      \"Well, if this isn't the limit!\" cried Tom Swift. \"As if we didn't  have trouble enough without a strike on our hands!\"    \"I should say yes!\" chimed in Job Titus.    \"Do you mean that the men won't work any more?\" asked his brother of  the native foreman.    \"Sure, no more work--um much 'fraid big devil in tunnel carry um off  an' eat um.\"    \"Well, I don't know that I blame 'em for being a bit frightened,\"  commented Job. \"It is a queer proceeding how twenty-five men can  disappear like that. Where have the men gone, Serato?\"    \"Gone home. No more work. Go on hit--strike--same like white men.\"    \"They waited until pay day to go on strike,\" commented the bookkeeper,  a youth about Tom's age.    This was true. The men had been paid off the day before, and usually on  such occasions many of them remained away, celebrating in the nearest  village. But this time all had left, and evidently did not intend to  come back.    \"We'll have to get a new gang,\" said Job. \"And it's going to delay us  just at the wrong time. Well, there's no help for it. Get busy, Serato.  You and Tim go and see how many men you can gather. Tell them we'll  give them a sol a week more if they do good work. (A sol is the  standard silver coin of Peru, and is worth in United States gold about  fifty cents.)    \"Half a dollar a day more will look mighty big to them,\" went on the  contractor. \"Get the men, Serato, and we'll raise your wages two sols a  week.\"    The eyes of the Indian gleamed, and he went off, saying.    \"Um try, but men much 'fraid.\"    Whether Serato used his best arguments could not, of course, be  learned, but he came back at the close of the day, unaccompanied by any  workers, and he shook his head despondently.    \"Indians no come for one sol, mebby not for two,\" he said.  \"I no can  git.\"    \"Then I'll try!\" cried Job. \"I'll get the workers. I'll make our old  ones come back, for they'll be the best.\"    Accompanied by his brother and Tom he went to the various Indian  villages, including the one whence most of the men now on strike had  come. The fifteen missing ones were not found, though, as before, their  relatives, and, in some cases, their families, did not seem alarmed.  But the men who had gone on strike were found lolling about their  cabins and huts, smoking and taking their ease, and no amount of  persuasion could induce them to return.    Some of them said they had worked long enough and were tired, needing a  rest. Others declared they had money enough and did not want more. Even  two more sols a week would not induce them to return.    And many were frankly afraid. They said so, declaring that if they went  back to the tunnel some unknown devil might carry them off under the  earth.    Job Titus and his brother, who could speak the language fairly well,  tried to argue against this. They declared the tunnel was perfectly  safe. But one native worker, who had been the best in the gang, asked:    \"Where um men go?\"    The contractors could not answer.    \"It's a trick,\" declared Walter. \"Our rivals have induced the men to go  on strike in order to hamper us with the work so they'll get the job.\"    But the closest inquiry failed to prove this statement. If Blakeson &  Grinder, or any of their agents, had a hand in the strike they covered  their operations well. Though diligent inquiry was made, no trace of  Waddington, or any other tool, could be found.    Tom, who had some sort of suspicion of the bearded man on the steamer,  tried to find him, even taking a trip in to Lima, but without avail.    The tunnel work was at a standstill, for there was little use in  setting off blasts if there were no men to remove the resulting piles  of debris. So, though Tom was ready with some specially powerful  explosive, he could not use it.    Efforts were made to get laborers from another section of the country,  but without effect. The contractors heard of a big force of Italians  who had finished work on a railroad about a hundred miles away, and  they were offered places in the tunnel. But they would not come.    \"Well, we may as well give up,\" said Walter, despondently, to his  brother one day. \"We'll never get the tunnel done on time now.\"    \"We still have a margin of safety,\" declared job. \"If we could get the  men inside of a couple of weeks, and if Tom's new powder rips out more  rock, we'll finish in time.\"    \"Yes, but there are too many ifs. We may as well admit we've failed.\"    \"I'll never do that!\"    \"What will you do?\"    But Job did not know.    \"If we could git a gang of min from the ould sod--th' kind I used t'  work wit in N'Yark,\" said Tim Sullivan, \"I'd show yez whot could be  done! We'd make th' rock fly!\"    But that efficient labor was out of the question now. The tunnel camp  was a deserted place.    \"Come on, Koku, we'll go hunting,\" said Tom one day.  \"There's no use  hanging around here, and some venison wouldn't go bad on the table.\"    \"I'll come, too,\" said Mr. Damon. \"I haven't anything to do.\"    The Titus brothers had gone to a distant village, on the forlorn hope  of getting laborers, so Tom was left to his own devices, and he decided  to go hunting with his electric rifle.    The taruco, or native deer, had been plentiful in the vicinity of the  tunnel until the presence of so many men and the frequent blasts had  driven them farther off, and it was not until after a tramp of several  miles that Tom saw one.  Then, after stalking it a little way, he  managed to kill it with the electric rifle.    Koku hoisted the"]]]
