Tin, kid, tin. I could turn it  inside out with a can opener. But I ain't long on a kit just now. I'm on  the hog for fair, as a matter of fact. Well, I don't need a kit. I got  some sawdust and I can make the soup as pretty as you ever seen. We'll  blow the safe, kid, and then we'll float. Are you on?\"    He paused, grinning with expectation, his face gradually becoming blank  as he saw no response in Terry.    \"As nearly as I can make out--because most of the slang is new to me,\"  said Terry, \"you want to dynamite the store safe and--\"    \"Who said sawdust? Soup, kid, soup! I want to blow the door off the  peter, not the roof off the house. Say, who d'you think I am, a boob?\"    \"I understand, then. Nitroglycerin? Denver, I'm not with you. It's mighty  good of you to ask me to join in--but that isn't my line of work.\"    The yegg raised an expostulatory hand, but Terry went on: \"I'm going to  keep straight, Denver.\"    It seemed as though this simple tiding took the breath from Denver.    \"Ah!\" he nodded at length. \"You playing up a new line. No strong-arm  stuff except when you got to use it. Going to try scratching, kid? Is  that it, or some other kind of slick stuff?\"    \"I mean what I say, Denver. I'm going straight.\"    The yegg shook his head, bewildered. \"Say,\" he burst out suddenly, \"ain't  you Black Jack's kid?\"    \"I'm his son,\" said Terry.    \"All right. You'll come to it. It's in the blood, Black Jack. You can't  get away from it.\"    Terry tugged his shirt open at the throat; he was stifling. \"Perhaps,\" he  said.    \"It's the easy way,\" went on Denver. \"Well, maybe you ain't ripe yet, but  when you are, tip me off. Gimme a ring and I'll be with you.\"    \"One more thing. You're broke, Denver. And I suppose you need what's in  that safe. But if you take it, the widow will be ruined. She runs the  hotel and the store, too, you know.\"    \"Why, you poor boob,\" groaned Denver, \"don't you know she's the old dame  that's trying to get you mobbed?\"    \"I suppose so. But she was pretty fond of the sheriff, you know. I don't  blame her for carrying a grudge. Now, about the money, Denver; I happen  to have a little with me. Take what you want.\"    Denver took the proffered money without a word, counted it with a deftly  stabbing forefinger, and shoved the wad into his hip pocket.    \"All right,\" he said, \"this'll sort of sweeten the pot. You don't need  it?\"    \"I'll get along without it. And you won't break the safe?\"    \"Hell!\" grunted Denver. \"Does it hang on that?\"    Terry leaned forward in his chair.    \"Denver, don't break that safe!\"    \"You kind of say that as if you was boss, maybe,\" sneered Denver.    \"I am,\" said Terry, \"as far as this goes.\"    \"How'll you stop me, kid? Sit up all night and nurse the safe?\"    \"No. But I'll follow you, Denver. And I'll get you. You understand? I'll  stay on your trail till I have you.\"    Again there was a long moment of silence, then, \"Black Jack!\" muttered  Denver. \"You're like his ghost! I think you'd get me, right enough! Well,  I'll call it off. This fifty will help me along a ways.\"    At the door he whirled sharply on Terence Hollis. \"How much have you got  left?\" he asked.    \"Enough,\" said Terry.    \"Then lemme have another fifty, will you?\"    \"I'm sorry. I can't quite manage it.\"    \"Make it twenty-five, then.\"    \"Can't do that either, Denver. I'm very sorry.\"    \"Hell, man! Are you a short sport? I got a long jump before me. Ain't you  got any credit around this town?\"    \"I--not very much, I'm afraid.\"    \"You're kidding me,\" scowled Denver. \"That wasn't Black Jack's way. From  his shoes to his skin everything he had belonged to his partners. His  ghost'll haunt you if you're turning me down, kid. Why, ain't you the  heir of a rich rancher over the hills? Ain't that what I been told?\"    \"I was,\" said Terry, \"until today.\"    \"Ah! You got turned out for beaning Minter?\"    Terry remained silent.    \"Without a cent?\"    Suddenly the pudgy arm of Denver shot out and his finger pointed into  Terry's face.    \"You damn fool! This fifty is the last cent you got in the world!\"    \"Not at all,\" said Terry calmly.    \"You lie!\" Denver struck his knuckles across his forehead. \"And I was  going to trim you. Black Jack, I didn't know you was as white as this.  Fifty? Pal, take it back!\"    He forced the money into Terry's pocket.    \"And take some more. Here; lemme stake you. I been pulling a sob story,  but I'm in the clover, Black Jack. Gimme your last cent, will you? Kid,  here's a hundred, two hundred--say what you want.\"    \"Not a cent--nothing,\" said Terry, but he was deeply moved.    Denver thoughtfully restored the money to his wallet.    \"You're white,\" he said gently. \"And you're straight as they come. Keep  it up if you can. I know damned well that you can't. I've seen 'em try  before. But they always slip. Keep it up, Black Jack, but if you ever  change your mind, lemme know. I'll be handy. Here's luck!\"    And he was gone as he had entered, with a whish of the swiftly moved door  in the air, and no click of the lock.        CHAPTER 19      The door had hardly closed on him when Terence wanted to run after him  and call him back. There was a thrill still running in his blood since  the time the yegg had leaned so close and said: \"That wasn't Black Jack's  way!\"    He wanted to know more about Black Jack, and he wanted to hear the story  from the lips of this man. A strange warmth had come over him. It had  seemed for a moment that there was a third impalpable presence in the  room--his father listening. And the thrill of it remained, a ghostly and  yet a real thing.    But he checked his impulse. Let Denver go, and the thought of his father  with him. For the influence of Black Jack, he felt, was quicksand pulling  him down. The very fact that he was his father's son had made him shoot  down one man. Again the shadow of Black Jack had fallen across his path  today and tempted him to crime. How real the temptation had been, Terry  did not know until he was alone. Half of ten thousand dollars would  support him for many a month. One thing was certain. He must let his  father remain simply a name.    Going to the window in his stocking feet, he listened again. There were  more voices murmuring on the veranda of the hotel now, but within a few  moments forms began to drift away down the street, and finally there was  silence. Evidently the widow had not secured backing as strong as she  could have desired. And Terry went to bed and to sleep.    He wakened with the first touch of dawn along the wall beside his bed and  tumbled out to dress. It was early, even for a mountain town. The  rattling at the kitchen stove commenced while he was on the way  downstairs. And he had to waste time with a visit to El Sangre in the  stable before his breakfast was ready.    Craterville was in the hollow behind him when the sun rose, and El Sangre  was taking up the miles with the tireless rhythm of his pace. He had  intended searching for work of some sort near Craterville, but now he  realized that it could not be. He must go farther. He must go where his  name was not known.    For two days he held on through the broken country, climbing more than he  dropped. Twice he came above the ragged timber line, with its wind-shaped  army of stunted trees, and over the tiny flowers of the summit lands. At  the end of the second day he came out on the edge of a precipitous  descent to a prosperous grazing country below. There would be his goal.    A big mountain sheep rounded a corner with a little flock behind him.  Terry dropped the leader with a snapshot and watched the flock scamper  down what was almost the sheer face of a cliff--a beautiful bit of  acrobatics. They found foothold on ridges a couple of inches deep, hardly  visible to the eye from above. Plunging down a straight drop without a  sign of a ledge for fifty feet below them, they broke the force of the  fall and slowed themselves constantly by striking their hoofs from side  to side against the face of the cliff. And so they landed, with bunched  feet, on the first broad terrace below and again bounced over the ledge  and so out of sight.    He dined on wild mutton that evening. In the morning he hunted along the  edge of the cliffs until he came to a difficult route down to the valley.  An ordinary horse would never have made it, but El Sangre was in his  glory. If he had not the agility of the mountain sheep, he was well-nigh  as level-headed in the face of tremendous heights. He knew how to pitch  ten feet down to a terrace and strike on his bunched hoofs so that the  force of the fall would not break his legs or unseat his rider. Again he  understood how to drive in the toes of his hoofs and go up safely through  loose gravel where most horses, even mustangs, would have skidded to the  bottom of the slope. And he was wise in trails. Twice he rejected the  courses which Terry picked, and the rider very wisely let him have his  way. The result was that they took a more winding, but a far safer  course, and arrived before midmorning in the bottomlands.    The first ranch house he applied to accepted him. And there he took up  his work.    It was the ordinary outfit--the sun- and wind-racked shack for a house,  the stumbling outlying barns and sheds, and the maze of corral fences.  They asked Terry no questions, accepted his first name without an  addition, and let him go his way.    He was happy enough. He had not the leisure for thought or for  remembering better times. If he had leisure here and there, he used it  industriously in teaching El Sangre the \"cow\" business. The stallion  learned swiftly. He began to take a joy in sitting down on a rope.    At the end of a week Terry won a bet when a team of draught horses  hitched onto his line could not pull El Sangre over his mark,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#19)"],[1,"loose.\"    \"I ain't agoin' to crawfish now,\" growled Metzar. \"Strikes me, too,  I'm losin' more'n you.\"    \"You won't be a loser if you can get back to Detroit with your scalp.  I'll pay you in horses and gold. Once we reach Legget's place  we're safe.\"    \"What's yer plan about gittin' the gal?\" asked Metzar.    Brandt leaned forward and spoke eagerly, but in a low tone.    \"Git away on hoss-back?\" questioned Metzar, visibly brightening. \"Wal,  that's some sense. Kin ye trust ther other party?\"    \"I'm sure I can,\" rejoined Brandt.    \"It'll be a good job, a good job an' all done in daylight, too. Bing  Legget couldn't plan better,\" Metzar said, rubbing his hands,    \"We've fooled these Zanes and their fruit-raising farmers for a year,  and our time is about up,\" Brandt muttered. \"One more job and we've  done. Once with Legget we're safe, and then we'll work slowly back  towards Detroit. Let's get out of here now, for some one may come at  any moment.\"    The plotters separated, Brandt going through the grove, and Metzar  down the path by which he had come.           *       *       *       *       *    Helen, trembling with horror of what she had heard, raised herself  cautiously from the willows where she had lain, and watched the  innkeeper's retreating figure. When it had disappeared she gave a  little gasp of relief. Free now to run home, there to plan what course  must be pursued, she conquered her fear and weakness, and hurried from  the glade. Luckily, so far as she was able to tell, no one saw her  return. She resolved that she would be cool, deliberate, clever,  worthy of the borderman's confidence.    First she tried to determine the purport of this interview between  Brandt and Metzar. She recalled to mind all that was said, and  supplied what she thought had been suggested. Brandt and Metzar were  horse-thieves, aids of Bing Legget. They had repaired to the glade to  plan. The Indian had been a surprise. Wetzel had routed the Shawnees,  and was now on the trail of this chieftain. The Indian warned them to  leave Fort Henry and to meet him at a place called Two Islands.  Brandt's plan, presumably somewhat changed by the advent of the  red-man, was to steal horses, abduct a girl in broad daylight, and  before tomorrow's sunset escape to join the ruffian Legget.    \"I am the girl,\" murmured Helen shudderingly, as she relapsed  momentarily into girlish fears. But at once she rose above  selfish feelings.    Secondly, while it was easy to determine what the outlaws meant, the  wisest course was difficult to conceive. She had promised the  borderman to help him, and not speak of anything she learned to any  but himself. She could not be true to him if she asked advice. The  point was clear; either she must remain in the settlement hoping for  Jonathan's return in time to frustrate Brandt's villainous scheme, or  find the borderman. Suddenly she remembered Metzar's allusion to a  second person whom Brandt felt certain he could trust. This meant  another traitor in Fort Henry, another horse-thief, another desperado  willing to make off with helpless women.    Helen's spirit rose in arms. She had their secret, and could ruin  them. She would find the borderman.    Wetzel was on the trail at Eagle Rock. What for? Trailing an Indian  who was then five miles east of that rock? Not Wetzel! He was on that  track to meet Jonathan. Otherwise, with the redskins near the river,  he would have been closer to them. He would meet Jonathan there at  sunset to-day, Helen decided.    She paced the room, trying to still her throbbing heart and trembling  hands.    \"I must be calm,\" she said sternly. \"Time is precious. I have not a  moment to lose. I will find him. I've watched that mountain many a  time, and can find the trail and the rock. I am in more danger here,  than out there in the forest. With Wetzel and Jonathan on the mountain  side, the Indians have fled it. But what about the savage who warned  Brandt? Let me think. Yes, he'll avoid the river; he'll go round south  of the settlement, and, therefore, can't see me cross. How fortunate  that I have paddled a canoe many times across the river. How glad that  I made Colonel Zane describe the course up the mountains!\"    Her resolution fixed, Helen changed her skirt for one of buckskin,  putting on leggings and moccasins of the same serviceable material.  She filled the pockets of a short, rain-proof jacket with biscuits,  and, thus equipped, sallied forth with a spirit and exultation she  could not subdue. Only one thing she feared, which was that Brandt or  Metzar might see her cross the river. She launched her canoe and  paddled down stream, under cover of the bluff, to a point opposite the  end of the island, then straight across, keeping the island between  her and the settlement. Gaining the other shore, Helen pulled the  canoe into the willows, and mounted the bank. A thicket of willow and  alder made progress up the steep incline difficult, but once out of it  she faced a long stretch of grassy meadowland. A mile beyond began the  green, billowy rise of that mountain which she intended to climb.    Helen's whole soul was thrown into the adventure. She felt her strong  young limbs in accord with her heart.    \"Now, Mr. Brandt, horse-thief and girl-snatcher, we'll see,\" she said  with scornful lips. \"If I can't beat you now I'm not fit to be Betty  Zane's friend; and am unworthy of a borderman's trust.\"    She traversed the whole length of meadowland close under the shadow of  the fringed bank, and gained the forest. Here she hesitated. All was  so wild and still. No definite course through the woods seemed to  invite, and yet all was open. Trees, trees, dark, immovable trees  everywhere. The violent trembling of poplar and aspen leaves, when all  others were so calm, struck her strangely, and the fearful stillness  awed her. Drawing a deep breath she started forward up the gently  rising ground.    As she advanced the open forest became darker, and of wilder aspect.  The trees were larger and closer together. Still she made fair  progress without deviating from the course she had determined upon.  Before her rose a ridge, with a ravine on either side, reaching nearly  to the summit of the mountain. Here the underbrush was scanty, the  fallen trees had slipped down the side, and the rocks were not so  numerous, all of which gave her reason to be proud, so far, of  her judgment.    Helen, pressing onward and upward, forgot time and danger, while she  reveled in the wonder of the forestland. Birds and squirrels fled  before her; whistling and wheezing of alarm, or heavy crashings in the  bushes, told of frightened wild beasts. A dull, faint roar, like a  distant wind, suggested tumbling waters. A single birch tree, gleaming  white among the black trees, enlivened the gloomy forest. Patches of  sunlight brightened the shade. Giant ferns, just tinging with autumn  colors, waved tips of sculptured perfection. Most wonderful of all  were the colored leaves, as they floated downward with a sad,  gentle rustle.    Helen was brought to a realization of her hazardous undertaking by a  sudden roar of water, and the abrupt termination of the ridge in a  deep gorge. Grasping a tree she leaned over to look down. It was fully  an hundred feet deep, with impassable walls, green-stained and damp,  at the bottom of which a brawling, brown brook rushed on its way.  Fully twenty feet wide, it presented an insurmountable barrier to  further progress in that direction.    But Helen looked upon it merely as a difficulty to be overcome. She  studied the situation, and decided to go to the left because higher  ground was to be seen that way. Abandoning the ridge, she pressed on,  keeping as close to the gorge as she dared, and came presently to a  fallen tree lying across the dark cleft. Without a second's  hesitation, for she knew such would be fatal, she stepped upon the  tree and started across, looking at nothing but the log under her  feet, while she tried to imagine herself walking across the  water-gate, at home in Virginia.    She accomplished the venture without a misstep. When safely on the  ground once more she felt her knees tremble and a queer, light feeling  came into her head. She laughed, however, as she rested a moment. It  would take more than a gorge to discourage her, she resolved with set  lips, as once again she made her way along the rising ground.    Perilous, if not desperate, work was ahead of her. Broken, rocky  ground, matted thicket, and seemingly impenetrable forest, rose darkly  in advance. But she was not even tired, and climbed, crawled, twisted  and turned on her way upward. She surmounted a rocky ledge, to face a  higher ridge covered with splintered, uneven stones, and the fallen  trees of many storms. Once she slipped and fell, spraining her wrist.  At length this uphill labor began to weary her. To breathe caused a  pain in her side and she was compelled to rest.    Already the gray light of coming night shrouded the forest. She was  surprised at seeing the trees become indistinct; because the shadows  hovered over the thickets, and noted that the dark, dim outline of the  ridges was fading into obscurity.    She struggled on up the uneven slope with a tightening at her heart  which was not all exhaustion. For the first time she doubted herself,  but it was too late. She could not turn back. Suddenly she felt that  she was on a smoother, easier course. Not to strike a stone or break a  twig seemed unusual. It might be a path worn by deer going to a  spring. Then into her troubled mind flashed the joyful thought, she  had found a trail.    Soft, wiry grass, springing from a wet soil, rose under her feet. A  little rill trickled alongside the trail. Mossy, soft-cushioned stones  lay imbedded here and there. Young maples and hickories grew  breast-high on either side, and the way wound in and out under the  lowering shade of forest monarchs.
