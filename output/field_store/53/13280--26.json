Faith must be  living and growing, and the living and growing faith should assume no  fixed form.  It might seem for a superficial observer to take a fixed  form, as a running river appears constant, though it goes through  ceaseless changes.  The dead faith, immutable and conventional, makes  its embracer appear religious and respectable, while it arrests his  spiritual growth.  It might give its owner comfort and pride, yet it  at bottom proves to be fetters to his moral uplifting.  It is on this  account that Zen declares: \"Buddha is nothing but spiritual chain or  moral fetters,\" and, \"If you remember even a name of Buddha, it would  deprive you of purity of heart.\"  The conventional or orthodox idea  of Buddha or Deity might seem smooth and fair, like a gold chain,  being polished and hammered through generations by religious  goldsmiths; but it has too much fixity and frigidity to be worn by us.    \"Strike off thy fetters, bonds that bind thee down  Of shining gold or darker, baser ore;    Know slave is slave caressed or whipped, not free;  For fetters tho' of gold, are not less strong to bind.\"    --The Song of the Sannyasin.        3. Buddha is Unnamable.    Give a definite name to Deity, He would be no more than what the name  implies.  The Deity under the name of Brahman necessarily differs  from the Being under the appellation of Jehovah, just as the Hindu  differs from the Jew.  In like manner the Being designated by God  necessarily differs from One named Amitabha or from Him entitled  Allah.  To give a name to the Deity is to give Him tradition,  nationality, limitation, and fixity, and it never brings us nearer to  Him.  Zen's object of worship cannot be named and determined as God,  or Brahman, or Amitabha, or Creator, or Nature, or Reality, or  Substance, or the like.  Neither Chinese nor Japanese masters of Zen  tried to give a definite name to their object of adoration.  They now  called Him That One, now This One, now Mind, now Buddha, now  Tathagata, now Certain Thing, now the True, now Dharma-nature, now  Buddha-nature, and so forth.  Tung Shan[FN#141] (To-zan) on a certain  occasion declared it to be \"A Certain Thing that pillars heaven above  and supports the earth below; dark as lacquer and undefinable;  manifesting itself through its activities, yet not wholly comprisable  within them.\"  So-kei[FN#142] expressed it in the same wise: \"There  exists a Certain Thing, bright as a mirror, spiritual as a mind, not  subjected to growth nor to decay.\"  Huen Sha (Gen-sha) comparing it  with a gem says: \"There exists a bright gem illuminating through the  worlds in ten directions by its light.\"[FN#143]      [FN#141]  Tung Shan Luh (To-zan-roku, 'Sayings and Doings of Ta-zan')  is one of the best Zen books.    [FN#142]  So-kei, a Korean Zenist, whose work entitled Zen-ke-ki-kwan  is worthy of our note as a representation of Korean Zen.    [FN#143]  Sho-bo-gen-zo.      This certain thing or being is too sublime to be named after a  traditional or a national deity, too spiritual to be symbolized by  human art, too full of life to be formulated in terms of mechanical  science, too free to be rationalized by intellectual philosophy, too  universal to be perceived by bodily senses; but everybody can feel  its irresistible power, see its invisible presence, and touch its  heart and soul within himself.  \"This mysterious Mind,\" says Kwei  Fung (Kei-ho), \"is higher than the highest, deeper than the deepest,  limitless in all directions.  There is no centre in it.  No  distinction of east and west, and above and below.  Is it empty?  Yes, but not empty like space.  Has it a form?  Yes, but has no form  dependent on another for its existence.  Is it intelligent?  Yes, but  not intelligent like your mind.  Is it non-intelligent?  Yes, but not  non-intelligent like trees and stone.  Is it conscious?  Yes, but not  conscious like you when waking.  Is it bright?  Yes, but not bright  like the sun or the moon.\"  To the question, \"What and who is  Buddha?\"  Yuen Wu (En-go) replied: \"Hold your tongue: the mouth is  the gate of evils!\" while Pao Fuh (Ho-fuku) answered to the same  question: \"No skill of art can picture Him.\"  Thus Buddha is  unnamable, indescribable, and indefinable, but we provisionally call  Him Buddha.        4. Buddha, the Universal Life.    Zen conceives Buddha as a Being, who moves, stirs, inspires,  enlivens, and vitalizes everything.  Accordingly, we may call Him the  Universal Life in the sense that He is the source of all lives in the  universe.  This Universal Life, according to Zen, pillars the heaven,  supports the earth, glorifies the sun and moon, gives voice to  thunder, tinges clouds, adorns the pasture with flowers, enriches the  field with harvest, gives animals beauty and strength.  Therefore,  Zen declares even a dead clod of earth to be imbued with the divine  life, just as Lowell expresses a similar idea when he says:    \"Every clod feels a stir of might,  An instinct within it that reaches and towers,  And groping blindly above it for light,  Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers.\"    One of our contemporary Zenists wittily observed that 'vegetables are  the children of earth, that animals which feed on vegetables are the  grand-children of earth, and that men who subsist on animals are the  great-grand-children of earth.'  If there be no life in earth, how  could life come out of it?  If there be no life, the same as the  animal's life in the vegetables, how could animals sustain their  lives feeding on vegetables?  If there be no life similar to ours in  animals, how could we sustain our life by subsisting on them?  The  poet must be in the right, not only in his esthetic, but in his  scientific point of view, in saying-    \"I must  Confess that I am only dust.  But once a rose within me grew;  Its rootlets shot, its flowerets flew;  And all rose's sweetness rolled  Throughout the texture of my mould;  And so it is that I impart  Perfume to them, whoever thou art.\"    As we men live and act, so do our arteries; so does blood; so do  corpuscles.  As cells and protoplasm live and act, so do elements,  molecules, and atoms.  As elements and atoms live and act, so do  clouds; so does the earth; so does the ocean, the Milky Way, and the  Solar System.  What is this life which pervades the grandest as well  as the minutest works of Nature, and which may fitly be said 'greater  than the greatest and smaller than the smallest?'  It cannot be  defined.  It cannot be subjected to exact analysis.  But it is  directly experienced and recognized within us, just as the beauty of  the rose is to be perceived and enjoyed, but not reduced to exact  analysis.  At any rate, it is something stirring, moving, acting and  reacting continually.  This something which can be experienced and  felt and enjoyed directly by every one of us.  This life of living  principle in the microcosmos is identical with that of the  macrocosmos, and the Universal Life of the macrocosmos is the common  source of all lives.  Therefore, the Mahaparinirvana-sutra says:    \"Tathagata (another name for Buddha) gives life to all beings, just  as the lake Anavatapta gives rise to the four great rivers.\"  \"Tathagata,\" says the same sutra, \"divides his own body into  innumerable bodies, and also restores an infinite number of bodies to  one body.  Now be becomes cities, villages, houses, mountains,  rivers, and trees; now he has a large body; now he has a small body;  now he becomes men, women, boys, and girls.\"        5. Life and Change.    A peculiar phase of life is change which appears in the form of  growth and decay.  Nobody can deny the transitoriness of life.  One  of our friends humorously observed: \"Everything in the world may be  doubtful to you, but it can never be doubted that you will die.\"  Life is like a burning lamp.  Every minute its flame dies out and is  renewed.  Life is like a running stream.  Every moment it pushes  onward.  If there be anything constant in this world of change, it  should be change itself.  Is it not just one step from rosy childhood  to snowy age?  Is it not just one moment from the nuptial song to the  funeral-dirge?  Who can live the same moment twice?  In comparison with an organism, inorganic matter appears to be  constant and changeless; but, in fact, it is equally subjected to  ceaseless alteration.  Every morning, looking into the mirror, you  will find your visage reflected in it just as it was on the preceding  day; so also every morning, looking at the sun and the earth, you  will find them reflected in your retina just as they were on the  previous morning; but the sun and the earth are no less changeless  than you.  Why do the sun and the earth seem changeless and constant  to you?  Only because you yourself undergo change more quickly than  they.  When you look at the clouds sweeping across the face of the  moon, they seem to be at rest, and the moon in rapid motion; but, in  fact, the clouds, as well as the moon, incessantly move on.    Science might maintain the quantitative constancy of matter, but the  so-called matter is mere abstraction.  To say matter is changeless is  as much as to say 2 is always 2, changeless and constant, because the  arithmetical number is not more abstract than the physiological  matter.  The moon appears standing still when you look at her only a  few moments.  In like manner she seems to be free from change when  you look at her in your short span of life.  Astronomers,  nevertheless, can tell you how she saw her better days, and is now in  her wrinkles and white hair.        6. Pessimistic View of the Ancient Hindus.    In addition to this, the new theory of matter has entirely over  thrown the old conception of the unchanging atoms, and they are now  regarded to be composed of magnetic forces, ions, and corpuscles in  incessant motion.

If you do not, then  I will flog you--as I promised.\"    \"Very well,\" returned the sorcerer, with a desperate look upon his  face; \"I'll go and find the enchantment.\"    \"And we'll go with you,\" remarked the prince, pleasantly.    So the entire party accompanied Kwytoffle into the house, where they  entered a large room that was in a state of much disorder.    \"Let me see,\" said the sorcerer, rubbing his ears, as if trying to  think; \"I wonder if I put them in this cupboard.  You see,\" he  explained, \"no one has ever before dared me to transform him into a  June-bug or grasshopper, so I have almost forgotten where I keep my  book of enchantments.  No, it's not in the cupboard,\" he continued,  looking there; \"but it surely must be in this chest.\"    It was not in the chest, either, and so the sorcerer continued to look  in all sorts of queer places for his book of enchantments, without  finding it.  Whenever he paused in his search Prince Marvel would say,  sternly:    \"Go on!  Find the book!  Hunt it up.  We are all anxious to become  grasshoppers.\"  And then Kwytoffle would set to work again, although  big drops of perspiration were now streaming down his face.    Finally he pulled an old book from underneath the pillow of his bed,  and crying, \"Here it is!\" carried it to the window.    He turned a few leaves of the book and then said:    \"How unfortunate!  The compound I require to change you into  grasshoppers must be mixed on the first day of September; and as this  is now the eighth day of September I must wait nearly a year before I  can work the enchantment.\"    \"How about the June-bugs?\" asked Nerle.    \"Oh!  Ah!  The June-bug mixture can only be made at the dark o' the  moon,\" said the sorcerer, pretending to read, \"and that is three weeks  from now.\"    \"Let me read it,\" said Prince Marvel, suddenly snatching the book from  Kwytoffle's hands.  Then he turned to the title-page and read:    \"'Lives of Famous Thieves and Impostors.'  Why, this is not a book of  enchantments.\"    \"That is what I suspected,\" said Terribus.    \"No one but a sorcerer can read the enchantments in this book,\"  declared Kwytoffle; but he hung his head with a sheepish look, for he  knew his deception had been well understood.    \"Is your own history written in this volume?\" inquired Marvel.    \"No,\" answered the sorcerer.    \"Then it ought to be,\" said the prince, \"for you are no sorcerer at  all, but merely a thief and an impostor!\"        22.  The Queen of Plenta    The soldiers of Kwytoffle wanted to hang their old master at once, for  he had won their enmity by abusing them in many ways; but Prince Marvel  would not let them do this.  However, they tied the false sorcerer to a  post, and the captain gave him a good whipping--one lash for each  letter in the words \"grasshopper\" and \"June-bug.\"  Kwytoffle howled  loudly for mercy, but no one was at all sorry for him.    Wul-Takim tied a rope around the impostor's neck, and when the party  left the castle they journeyed all through the kingdom of Auriel, and  at every town or city they came to the reformed thief would cry out to  the populace:    \"Here is the terrible sorcerer Kwytoffle, who threatened to change you  into grasshoppers and june-bugs.  But you may see that he is a very  common man, with no powers of sorcery whatever!\"    And then the people would laugh and pelt mud at their former tyrant,  and thank Prince Marvel for haying exposed the false and wicked  creature.    And they called the son of their old king back to his lawful throne,  where he ruled wisely and well; and the hoarded wealth of Kwytoffle was  divided among the people again, and soon the country became prosperous  once more.    This adventure was very amusing to the pretty High Ki of Twi.  It  afforded them laughter for many days, and none of the party ever saw a  grasshopper or a june-bug afterward without thinking of the terrible  sorcerer Kwytoffle.    They left that disgraced person grooming horses for his board in the  stables of the new king, and proceeded upon their journey.    Without further event they reached the splendid southern Kingdom of  Plenta, which was the most delightfully situated of any dominion in the  Enchanted Island of Yew.  It was ruled by a good and generous queen,  who welcomed the strangers to her palace and gave a series of gay  entertainments in their honor.    King Terribus was especially an object of interest, for every one had  heard his name and feared him and his fierce people.  But when they  beheld his pleasant countenance and listened to his gentle voice they  began to regard him with much love and respect; and really Terribus was  worthy of their friendship since he had changed from a deformed monster  into an ordinary man, and had forbidden his people ever again to rob  and plunder their weaker neighbors.    But the most popular personages visiting at the court of the Queen of  Plenta were the lovely High Ki of Twi.  Although beautiful girls  abounded in this kingdom, none could compare with the royal twins, and  their peculiar condition only served to render them the more  interesting.    Two youths would approach the High Ki at the same time and invite them  to dance, and in united voices they would accept the invitation and go  whirling around the room with exactly the same steps, laughing at the  same instant and enjoying the dance equally.  But if one youth asked  his partner a question, both the twins would make answer, and that was  sure to confuse and embarrass the youth.  Still, the maids managed very  well to adapt themselves to the ways of people who were singular,  although they sometimes became a little homesick for Twi, where they  were like all the other people.    The bald-headed Ki kept watchful eyes on their youthful rulers, and  served them very cheerfully.  But with all their travels and  experiences, the old men could never be convinced it was better to be  singular than double.    Prince Marvel was the real hero of the party, and Nerle received much  attention on account of his master's popularity.  He did not seem as  unhappy as usual, and when the prince inquired the reason, his esquire  answered that he believed the excitement of their adventures was fast  curing him of his longing for something he could not have.  As for the  pleasure of suffering, he had had some experience of that, too, and it  was not nearly so delightful as he had expected.    Wul-Takim was not a society man, so he stayed around the royal stables  and made friends with the grooms, and traded his big black horse for  two bay ones and a gold neck-chain, and was fairly content with his lot.    And so the party enjoyed several happy weeks at the court of the good  Queen of Plenta, until one day the terrible news arrived that carried  them once more into exciting adventures.        23.  The Red Rogue of Dawna    One morning, while they were all standing in the courtyard waiting for  their horses, as they were about to go for a ride, a courier came  galloping swiftly up to the palace and cried:    \"Does any one know where Prince Marvel can be found?\"    \"I am Prince Marvel,\" replied the young knight, stepping out from among  the others.    \"Then have I reached my journey's end!\" said the courier, whose horse  was nearly exhausted from long and hard riding.  \"The Lady Seseley is  in great danger, and sends for you to come and rescue her.  The great  Baron Merd, her father, has been killed and his castle destroyed, and  all his people are either captives or have been slain outright.\"    \"And who has done this evil thing?\" asked Prince Marvel, looking very  stern and grave.    \"The Red Rogue of Dawna,\" answered the messenger.  \"He quarreled with  the Baron Merd and sent his savage hordes to tear down his castle and  slay him.  I myself barely escaped with my life, and the Lady Seseley  had but time to say, before she was carried off, that if I could find  Prince Marvel he would surely rescue her.\"    \"And so I will!\" declared the prince, \"if she be still alive.\"    \"Who is this Lady Seseley?\" asked Nerle, who had come to his master's  side.    \"She is my first friend, to whom I owe my very existence.  It is her  image, together with those of her two friends, which is graven on my  shield,\" answered Prince Marvel, thoughtfully.    \"And what will you do?\" inquired the esquire.    \"I must go to her at once.\"    When they heard of his mission all the party insisted on accompanying  him.  Even the dainty High Ki could not be deterred by any thoughts of  dangers they might encounter; and after some discussion Prince Marvel  allowed them to join him.    So Wul-Takim sharpened his big broadsword, and Nerle carefully prepared  his master's horse, so that before an hour had passed they were  galloping toward the province of the Red Rogue of Dawna.    Prince Marvel knew little concerning this personage, but Nerle had much  to tell of him.  The Red Rogue had once been page to a wise scholar and  magician, who lived in a fine old castle in Dawna and ruled over a  large territory.  The boy was very small and weak--smaller even than  the average dwarf--and his master did not think it worth while to watch  him.  But one evening, while the magician was standing upon the top of  the highest tower of his castle, the boy gave him a push from behind,  and he met death on the sharp rocks below.  Then the boy took his  master's book of magic and found a recipe to make one grow.  He made  the mixture and swallowed it, and straightway began to grow big and  tall.  This greatly delighted him, until he found he was getting much  bigger than the average man and rapidly becoming a giant.  So he sought  for a way to arrest the action of the magical draft; but before he  could find it he had grown to enormous proportions, and was bigger than  the biggest giant.  There was nothing in the book of magic to make one  grow smaller, so he was obliged to remain as he was--the"]]]
