I did not  like to bear down on a lee shore and so kept our wind stretching for the  westernmost side of the bay...no part of this bay as yet has been  surveyed owing to the sea, wind and the before-mentioned numerous fires  of the natives, but as our courses and distance were all with a free wind  till we hauled off...there will be no great mistake found in that part of  this bay laid down. Till 8 P.M. from our run from Western Port the soil  of all the land from abreast of Elizabeth's Cove to Cape Shanks is  excellent; after you round Cape Shanks and stand to west the land is  invariably low and sandy with little hummocks here and there of grass and  small bushes till you get down as far as this supposed harbour; on the  opposite side the land gently rises a little for about 10 or 12 miles,  seemingly good ground, it then sweeps away in a long bight of low land  which we could just perceive at sundown...At noon saw the distant  appearance of land on our larboard beam and from latitude observed 38  degrees 48 minutes 14 seconds, I take it to be somewhere near about Cape  Shanks; bore away for Cape Albany Otway. Altitudes for Time-keeper one  giving Longitude 144 degrees 35 minutes 00 seconds and the second  Longitude 144 degrees 35 minutes 45 seconds east. All these 24 hours  sound ground from 45 to 33 fathoms. Sand mixed with shells and brown  specks.    \"Wednesday, 6th January. Kept running for Cape Albany and by 7 P.M.  having nearly run into its latitude stood off and on during night. In the  morning it was very hazy otherwise would have seen the land. At half-past  9 A.M. saw Cape Albany, bearing west-north-west 10 or 12 miles distance  and Cape Danger north-west 16 or 17 miles; both these capes marked with  white sandy front and middling high, all the land between is sandy hills  and long sandy beach, as also what part of the land we saw stretching  into Portland Bay. Ground invariably mixed with shells and brown specks,  sometimes a little gravel, till the last time when we had 24 fathoms fine  sand. At the time Cape Albany bore 26 or 27 miles. At noon hauled our  wind for Harmingar Rock* (* Harbinger.) but owing to heavy sea and wind  did not make better than south-east course--the vessel labouring and  pitching a great deal.    \"Thursday, 7th January. From noon till 5 P.M. strong winds at  north-north-east and a confused heavy sea...This weather settled into  hard gale at south-west by 7 a tumultuous sea up and we laboured much and  lurched very heavy. At 6 A.M. it cleared--set sails, out all reefs  intending to make Governor King's Island while this clear weather  continued; as it will be seen, unfavourable winds and weather has  prevented me either tracing coast from Cape Shanks to Cape Albany, as  after making Cape Albany from being able to run a straight course to  Harminger Rock; both of these points will be attempted.    \"Friday, 8th January. Altitude 145 degrees 07 minutes 15 seconds--this  confirmed me that we must have been driven eastward.    \"Saturday, 9th January. Saw the loom of the land from the masthead which  I take to be Governor King's Island--its southernmost point bore S.W.S.  distant 16 miles. We could only see it now and then as the squalls passed  over. Kept working to this land which I rather think is part of the same  that on the 6th I saw and supposed it to be the northernmost cape, Cape  Danger, and another Cape Albany. I...will in making circuit easily know  them, both being sandy bluffs.    \"Sunday, 10th January. Kept all night working up to land and by 7 A.M.  got within 6 miles of the body of the island; kept edging down along it a  4 or 5 miles distance; the land in general high and covered with brush  and now and then spots of large trees very tall. At 8 A.M. we saw two  rocks we had passed at 7 A.M.--make out exactly like 2 boats under sail,  they are both very near the land...As we kept running down along the land  I saw a low point of rock make out with a good deal of surf and the land  lay so far back that I concluded at least a deep bight must be  there--this proved true, as we rounded it the swell of the sea which  before was high greatly took off and although the wind blew hard yet as  it was off shore...lowered the boat and sent Mr. Bowen and two good hands  in her on shore...At half-past 11 the weather looking worse instead of  better made a signal for our boat which they noticed and came off--by  noon they got on board, and Mr. Bowen reported that wood and excellent  water was in abundance, that safe anchorage and good ground was close  into the beach--the soil is middling good, in short, it is an excellent  place to take shelter in from all worst winds that blow in this  country...Latitude of this bight is 40 degrees 00 minutes 09 seconds  south and Longitude 143 degrees 57 minutes 45 seconds east.    \"Monday, 11th January. Running along shore at a distance of 4 miles at 1  P.M. Saw a rock bearing west distant 10 miles and a low point  north-north-west 9 or 10 miles--as we run down, this point still making  out made us begin to think that we should here find a bay or harbour. By  2 P.M. we completely opened it and saw it was a bay of large extent and  fine shelter...where we came to anchor. Found the tide of flood running  to the Westward nearly done (4 P.M.)--the different parts of the bay bore  as follows: Elephant Rock* (* (Note in log.) So named from resemblance to  that animal.) north by east distant at 5 miles north part of the bay  north 1/2 west distant 6 miles--the bottom of bay west-north-west 2 1/2  miles distant and the south point of ditto south-south-east, or 4 miles.  I now went on shore, found a good deal of surf on the beach till we got  on the southern side...here we landed and the first thing we saw was a  number of sea elephants* (* The Phoca proboscidea of Peron.) of an  immense size lying asleep on the beach, each of them, Barnes the  boatswain's mate told me, would make 8 or 9 barrels of oil; as we rowed  down the shore we took them to be bluish rocks. We found along this beach  two freshwater lagoons full of those animals which made it taste  brackish...We could not get near the upper part of them on account of the  number of elephants playing in them both. I named the bay Elephant Bay  from this circumstance.    \"Tuesday, 12th January. Boat returned on board, they caught 4 badgers and  saw several kangaroos, but were not able to get any from the thickness of  the brush--they also found feathers of emus and a dead one. Snakes are  here, as the skin of one was found. We got several gallons of elephant  oil out to-day as a specimen to Government and for our own use...some  wood growing here reported different to any seen before...    \"Wednesday, 13th January. Received some specimens of wood and some water.  At half-past 10 up and run out of bay, hoisted in gig, running down  shore; surveyed as well as weather would permit.    \"Thursday, 14th January. Fair wind and cloudy. Running along shore 3 or 4  miles off and surveying it. At 4 P.M. having run as far as North-West  Point, and seeing a number of breakers ahead, hove to. We could have done  nothing by standing on in such weather. At 5 P.M. dropped kedge with the  warp to see if that would ride her and found she would ride by it very  well, furled sail and pointed yards. The land from Elephant Bay to here  is rather low of sandy soil and a very long white sandy beach all this  distance. The two sandy capes or rather bluffs are about 20 miles from  Elephant Bay and are so remarkable that I think no person could be well  mistaken in them. The course to Elephant Bay is nearly south-east by  compass; no person need mistake the bay as Elephant Rock lies in the  mouth of it about 3 miles from its north part. The bottom is sand gravel  mixed with broken shells...At 7 A.M. got nearly as far as the second  rocks and breakers, found a very high sea up. At this time saw an island  bearing south-west by south. The island presents a bold rocky front to  the sea and foul ground--breakers and rocks lie off from it a long way.  Not less than 10 miles from here, on looking to the southward, a low  island is seen and due south the furthest point of land--it appears  altogether rather a dangerous place unless a vessel has a good breeze  that can be depended on. A calm with such a current as we found here  might chance to run her upon one rock or another...    \"Friday, 15th January. Moderate fair weather. At 3 P.M. tacked in shore  and at 4 P.M. shortened sail and stood off and on within 2 or 3 miles of  the sand bluffs; lowered gig and sent the First Mate in her on shore to  examine this part of the island, found the variation to be 8 degrees 54  minutes east. At half-past 6 P.M. the boat got on board. Mr. Bowen told  me that there was a very high surf on the beach, that those bluffs were  entirely sand, no shells were on the beach--inland he said the soil was  good--he found no water here, some kangaroo were seen but could not be  got at, the officer shot one but it got away; he said that on going up  one of the trees he perceived inland a large sheet of water which he  thinks must have some entrance into it from the other side of the island.  I rather think it a lagoon or swamp, nevertheless we will give the other  side of the island a strict search when wind and weather will permit us  to go round.    \"Saturday, 16th January. At quarter past 4 A.M. breeze from north-east,  hazy weather and rain, stood in for Elephant Rock. At half-past 5 A.M.  made sail down the coast of island to the southward, surveying it and  sounding every half-hour...From 10 to 11 A.M. standing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#19)"],[1,"most part they provide no covering for their bodies, no retreat against  the perpetual severity of the climate?\"    [87] Hence it seems that these noble lads were deemed _principes_ in  rank, yet had their position among the _comites_ only. The German word  _Gesell_ is peculiarly appropriated to these comrades in arms. So highly  were they esteemed in Germany, that for killing or hurting them a fine  was exacted treble to that for other freemen.    [88] Hence, when Chonodomarus, king of the Alamanni, was taken prisoner  by the Romans, \"his companions, two hundred in number, and three friends  peculiarly attached to him, thinking it infamous to survive their  prince, or not to die for him, surrendered themselves to be put in  bonds.\"--Ammianus Marcellinus, xvi. 13.    [89] Hence Montesquieu (Spirit of Laws, xxx, 3) justly derives the  origin of vassalage. At first, the prince gave to his nobles arms and  provision: as avarice advanced, money, and then lands, were required,  which from benefices became at length hereditary possessions, and were  called fiefs. Hence the establishment of the feudal system.    [90] Caesar, with less precision, says, \"The Germans pass their whole  lives in hunting and military exercises.\" (Bell. Gall, vi. 21.) The  picture drawn by Tacitus is more consonant to the genius of a barbarous  people: besides that, hunting being the employment but of a few months  of the year, a greater part must necessarily be passed in indolence  by those who had no other occupation. In this circumstance, and those  afterwards related, the North American savages exactly agree with the  ancient Germans.    [91] This apparent contradiction is, however, perfectly agreeable to the  principles of human nature. Among people governed by impulse more than  reason, everything is in the extreme: war and peace; motion and rest;  love and hatred; none are pursued with moderation.    [92] These are the rudiments of tributes; though the contributions  here spoken of were voluntary, and without compulsion. The origin of  exchequers is pointed out above, where \"part of the mulct\" is said to  be \"paid to the king or state.\" Taxation was taught the Germans by the  Romans, who levied taxes upon them.    [93] So, in after-times, when tributes were customary, 500 oxen or cows  were required annually from the Saxons by the French kings Clothaire  I. and Pepin. (See Eccard, tom. i. pp. 84, 480.) Honey, corn, and other  products of the earth, were likewise received in tribute. (Ibid. p.  392.)    [94] For the expenses of war, and other necessities of state, and  particularly the public entertainments. Hence, besides the Steora, or  annual tribute, the Osterstuopha, or Easter cup, previous to the public  assembly of the Field of March, was paid to the French kings.    [95] This was a dangerous lesson, and in the end proved ruinous to  the Roman empire. Herodian says of the Germans in his time, \"They  are chiefly to be prevailed upon by bribes; being fond of money, and  continually selling peace to the Romans for gold.\"--Lib. vi. 139.    [96] This custom was of long duration; for there is not the mention of a  single city in Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote on the wars of the Romans  in Germany. The names of places in Ptolemy (ii. 11) are not, therefore,  those of cities, but of scattered villages. The Germans had not even  what we should call towns, notwithstanding Caesar asserts the contrary.    [97] The space surrounding the house, and fenced in by hedges, was that  celebrated Salic land, which descended to the male line, exclusively of  the female.    [98] The danger of fire was particularly urgent in time of war; for,  as Caesar informs us, these people were acquainted with a method of  throwing red-hot clay bullets from slings, and burning javelins, on the  thatch of houses. (Bell. Gall. v. 42.)    [99] Thus likewise Mela (ii. 1), concerning the Sarmatians: \"On account  of the length and severity of their winters, they dwell under ground,  either in natural or artificial caverns.\" At the time that Germany was  laid waste by a forty years' war, Kircher saw many of the natives who,  with their flocks, herds, and other possessions, took refuge in the  caverns of the highest mountains. For many other curious particulars  concerning these and other subterranean caves, see his Mundus  Subterraneus, viii. 3, p. 100. In Hungary, at this day, corn is commonly  stored in subterranean chambers.    [100] Near Newbottle, the seat of the Marquis of Lothian, are some  subterraneous apartments and passages cut out of the live rock, which  had probably served for the same purposes of winter-retreats and  granaries as those dug by the ancient Germans. Pennant's Tour in 1769,  4to, p.63.    [101] This was a kind of mantle of a square form, called also _rheno_.  Thus Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 21): \"They use skins for clothing, or the  short rhenones, and leave the greatest part of the body naked.\" Isidore  (xix. 23) describes the rhenones as \"garments covering the shoulders  and breast, as low as the navel, so rough and shaggy that they are  impenetrable to rain.\" Mela (iii. 3), speaking of the Germans, says,  \"The men are clothed only with the sagum, or the bark of trees, even in  the depth of winter.\"    [102] All savages are fond of variety of colors; hence the Germans  spotted their furs with the skins of other animals, of which those  here mentioned were probably of the seal kind. This practice is still  continued with regard to the ermine, which is spotted with black  lamb's-skin.    [103] The Northern Sea, and Frozen Ocean.    [104] Pliny testifies the same thing; and adds, that \"the women  beyond the Rhine are not acquainted with any more elegant kind of  clothing.\"--xix. 1.    [105] Not that rich and costly purple in which the Roman nobility shone,  but some ordinary material, such as the _vaccinium_, which Pliny says  was used by the Gauls as a purple dye for the garments of the slaves,  (xvi. 18.)    [106] The chastity of the Germans, and their strict regard to the laws  of marriage, are witnessed by all their ancient codes of law. The purity  of their manners in this respect afforded a striking contrast to the  licentiousness of the Romans in the decline of the empire, and is  exhibited in this light by Salvian, in his treatise De Gubernatione Dei,  lib. vii.    [107] Thus we find in Caesar (Bell. Gall. i. 53) that Ariovistus had  two wives. Others had more. This indulgence proved more difficult to  abolish, as it was considered as a mark of opulence, and an appendage of  nobility.    [108] The Germans purchased their wives, as appears from the following  clauses in the Saxon law concerning marriage: \"A person who espouses a  wife shall pay to her parents 300 solidi (about 180_l._ sterling);  but if the marriage be without the consent of the parents, the damsel,  however, consenting, he shall pay 600 solidi. If neither the parents nor  damsel consent, that is, if she be carried off by violence, he shall pay  300 solidi to the parents, and 340 to the damsel, and restore her to her  parents.\"    [109] Thus in the Saxon law, concerning dowries, it is said: \"The  Ostfalii and Angrarii determine, that if a woman have male issue, she  is to possess the dower she received in marriage during her life, and  transmit it to her sons.\"    [110] _Ergo septae pudicitia agunt_. Some editions have _septa  pudicitia_. This would imply, however, rather the result of the care and  watchfulness of their husbands; whereas it seems the object of Tacitus  to show that this their chastity was the effect of innate virtue, and  this is rather expressed by _septae pudicitia_, which is the reading of  the Arundelian MS.    [111] Seneca speaks with great force and warmth on this subject:  \"Nothing is so destructive to morals as loitering at public  entertainments; for vice more easily insinuates itself into the heart  when softened by pleasure. What shall I say! I return from them more  covetous ambitious, and luxurious.\"--Epist. vii.    [112] The Germans had a great regard for the hair, and looked upon  cutting it off as a heavy disgrace; so that this was made a punishment  for certain crimes, and was resented as an injury if practised upon an  innocent person.    [113] From an epistle of St. Boniface, archbishop of Mentz, to  Ethelbald, king of England, we learn that among the Saxons the women  themselves inflicted the punishment for violated chastity; \"In ancient  Saxony (now Westphalia), if a virgin pollute her father's house, or a  married woman prove false to her vows, sometimes she is forced to put an  end to her own life by the halter, and over the ashes of her burned body  her seducer is hanged: sometimes a troop of females assembling lead her  through the circumjacent villages, lacerating her body, stripped to  the girdle, with rods and knives; and thus, bloody and full of minute  wounds, she is continually met by new tormenters, who in their zeal for  chastity do not quit her till she is dead, or scarcely alive, in order  to inspire a dread of such offences.\" See Michael Alford's Annales  Ecclesiae Anglo-Saxon., and Eccard.    [114] A passage in Valerius Maximus renders it probable that the  Cimbrian states were of this number: \"The wives of the Teutones besought  Marius, after his victory, that he would deliver them as a present to  the Vestal virgins; affirming that they should henceforth, equally with  themselves, abstain from the embraces of the other sex. This request not  being granted, they all strangled themselves the ensuing night.\"--Lib.  vi. 1.3.    [115] Among the Heruli, the wife was expected to hang herself at once at  the grave of her husband, if she would not live in perpetual infamy.    [116] This expression may signify as well the murder of young children,  as the procurement of abortion; both which crimes were severely punished  by the German laws.    [117] _Quemquam ex agnatis_. By _agnati_ generally in Roman law were  meant"]]]
