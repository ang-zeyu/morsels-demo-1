A stone was then thrown at the English, upon which the  lieutenant ordered a musket to be fired with small shot. This struck  the eldest upon the legs, and he immediately ran to one of the houses,  which was at about a hundred yards distance. Mr. Cook, who now hoped  that the contest was over, instantly landed with his party; but they  had scarcely quitted the boat when the Indian returned, having only  left the rocks to fetch a shield or target for his defence. As soon as  he came up, he and his comrade threw each of them a lance in the midst  of our people, but happily without hurting a single person. At the  firing of a third musket, one of the two men darted another lance, and  then both of them ran away. After this the gentlemen repaired to the  huts, and threw into the house where the children were, some beads,  ribbons, pieces of cloth, and other presents. These they hoped would  procure them the good will of the inhabitants. When, however, the  lieutenant and his companions returned the next day, they had the  mortification of finding that the beads and ribbons, which they had  left the night before, had not been removed from their places, and  that not an Indian was to be seen.    Several of the natives of the country came in sight on the 30th, but  they could not be engaged to begin an intercourse with our people.  They approached within a certain distance of them, and, after shouting  several times, went back into the woods. Having done this once more,  Mr. Cook followed them himself, alone and unarmed, a considerable way  along the shore, but without prevailing upon them to stop.    On the 1st of May, he resolved to make an excursion into the country.  Accordingly, our commander, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and seven others,  all of them properly accoutred for the expedition, set out, and  repaired first to the huts near the watering-place, whither some of  the Indians continued every day to resort. Though the little presents  which had been left there before had not yet been taken away, our  gentlemen added others of still greater value, consisting of cloth,  beads, combs, and looking-glasses. After this they went up into the  country, the face of which is finely diversified by wood and lawn. The  soil they found to be either swamp or light sand.[6]      [Footnote 6: In a part of the country that was afterwards    examined, the soil was found to be much richer; being a deep black    mould, which the lieutenant thought very fit for the production of    grain of any kind.]    In cultivating the ground, there would be no obstruction from the  trees, which are tall, straight, and without underwood, and stand at a  sufficient distance from each other. Between the trees, the land is  abundantly covered with grass. Our voyagers saw many houses of the  inhabitants, but met with only one of the people, who ran away as soon  as he discovered the English. At every place where they went they left  presents, hoping that at length they might procure the confidence and  good will of the Indians. They perceived some traces of animals; and  the trees over their heads abounded with birds of various kinds, among  which were many of exquisite beauty. Loriquets and cockatoos, in  particular, were so numerous, that they flew in flocks of several  scores together.    While the lieutenant and his friends were upon this excursion, Mr.  Gore, who had been sent out in the morning to dredge for oysters,  having performed that service, dismissed his boat, and taking a  midshipman with him, set out to join the waterers by land. In his way,  he fell in with a body of two and twenty Indians, who followed him,  and were often at no greater distance than that of twenty yards. When  he perceived them so near, he stopped, and faced about, upon which  they likewise stopped; and when he went on again, they continued their  pursuit. But though they were all armed with lances, they did not  attack Mr. Gore; so that he and the midshipman got in safety to the  watering-place. When the natives came in sight of the main body of the  English, they halted at about the distance of a quarter of a mile, and  stood still. By this Mr. Monkhouse and two or three of the waterers  were encouraged to march up to them; but seeing the Indians keep their  ground, they were seized with a sudden fear which is not uncommon to  the rash and foolhardy, and made a hasty retreat. This step increased  the danger which it was intended to avoid. Four of the Indians  immediately ran forwards, and discharged their lances at the  fugitives, with such force that they went beyond them. Our people  recovering their spirits, stopped to collect the lances, upon which  the natives, in their turn, began to retire. At this time Mr. Cook  came up, with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia; and being desirous  of convincing the Indians that they were neither afraid of them, nor  designed to do them any injury, they advanced towards them,  endeavouring, by signs of expostulation and entreaty, to engage them  to an intercourse but without effect.    From the boldness which the natives discovered on the first landing of  our voyagers, and the terror that afterward seized them at the sight  of the English, it appears that they were sufficiently intimidated by  our fire-arms. There was not indeed, the least reason to believe that  any of them had been much hurt by the small shot which had been fired  at them when they attacked our people on their coming out of the boat.  Nevertheless, they had probably seen from their lurking places, the  effects which the muskets had upon birds. Tupia, who was become a good  marksman, frequently strayed abroad to shoot parrots; and while he was  thus employed, he once met with nine Indians, who, as soon as they  perceived that he saw them, ran from him, in great alarm and  confusion.    While on the 3rd of May, Mr. Banks was gathering plants near the  watering-place, Lieutenant Cook went with Dr. Solander and Mr.  Monkhouse, to the head of the bay, for the purpose of examining that  part of the country, and of making further attempts to form some  connexions with the natives. In this excursion they acquired  additional knowledge concerning the nature of the soil, and its  capacities for cultivation, but had no success in their endeavours to  engage the inhabitants in coming to a friendly intercourse. Several  parties, that were sent into the country, on the next day, with the  same view, were equally unsuccessful. In the afternoon our commander  himself, with a number of attendants, made an excursion to the north  shore, which he found to be without wood, and to resemble in some  degree, our moors in England. The surface of the ground was, however,  covered with a thin brush of plants, rising to about the height of the  knee. Near the coast, the hills are low, but there are others behind  them, which gradually ascend to a considerable distance, and are  intersected with marshes and morasses. Among the articles of fish  which, at different times were caught, were large stingrays. One of  them, when his entrails were taken out, weighed three hundred and  thirty-six pounds.    It was upon account of the great quantity of plants which Mr. Banks  and Dr. Solander collected in this place, that Lieutenant Cook was  induced to give it the name of Botany Bay. It is situated in the  latitude of 34 deg. south, and in the longitude of 208 deg. 37' west; and  affords a capacious, safe, and convenient shelter for shipping. The  Endeavour anchored near the south shore, about a mile within the  entrance, for the convenience of sailing with a southerly wind, and  because the lieutenant thought it the best situation for watering. But  afterward he found a very fine stream on the north shore, where was a  sandy cove, in which a ship might lie almost land-locked, and procure  wood and water to the greatest abundance. Though wood is every where  plentiful our commander saw only two species of it that could be  considered as timber. Not only the inhabitants who were first  discovered, but all who afterward came in sight, were entirely naked.  Of their mode of life, our voyagers could know but little, as not the  least connexion could be formed with them; but it did not appear that  they were numerous, or that they lived in societies. They seemed, like  other animals, to be scattered about along the coast, and in the  woods. Not a single article was touched by them of all that were left  at their huts, or at the places which they frequented; so little sense  had they of those small conveniences and ornaments, which are  generally very alluring to the uncivilized tribes of the globe. During  Mr. Cook's stay at this place, he caused the English colours to be  displayed every day on shore, and took care that the ship's name, and  the date of the year, should be inscribed upon one of the trees near  the watering-place.    At day-break, on Sunday the 6th of May, our navigators sailed from  Botany Bay; and as they proceeded on their voyage, the lieutenant gave  the names that are indicated upon the map to the bays, capes, points,  and remarkable hills which successively appeared in sight. On the  14th, as the Endeavour advanced to the northward, being then in  latitude 30 deg. 22' south, and longitude 206 deg. 39' west, the land  gradually increased in height, so that it may be called a hilly  country. Between this latitude and Botany Bay, it exhibits a pleasing  variety of ridges, hills, valleys and plains, all clothed with wood,  of the same appearance with that which has been mentioned before. The  land near the shore is in general low and sandy, excepting the points,  which are rocky, and over many of which are high hills, that, at their  first rising out of the water, have the semblance of islands. On the  next day, the vessel being about a league "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#19)"],[1,"aro, circle of friends (from amiko, friend).                              \"TEMPO\" AND \"FOJO\".    127. The general word for \"time\" in the sense of duration, or  suitability (as \"the proper time\"), is \"tempo\". The word \"fojo\",  time, occasion, refers to the performance or occurrence of an  act or event, in repetition or series:       Mi ne havas multe da tempo, I have not much time.     Li venis multajn fojojn, kaj la lastan fojon li restis longan tempon,        he came many times, and the last time he remained a long time.     Kelkajn fojojn lauxte tondris, several times it thundered loudly.     Multe da fojoj ni fermis la okulojn pro la fulmo,        many times we closed our eyes on account of the lightning.                        THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF PROPER NOUNS.    128. Proper nouns, that is, nouns which are names of persons, cities,  countries, etc., are given Esperanto spelling if they are names of  continents, countries, large or very well-known cities, or if they  are first (Christian) names of persons, as \"Azio\", Asia, \"Skotlando\",  Scotland, \"Bostono\", Boston, \"Johano\", John, \"Mario\", Mary. Surnames  and names of places which are small or not well known are more often  quoted in the national spelling. The pronunciation may be indicated  in parentheses, as \"Mt. Vernon\" (\"Mauxnt Vernon\"), \"Roberto Bruce\"  (\"Brus\"), \"Martinique\" (\"Martinik'\"), etc.                                     VOCABULARY       arane-o = spider.                  ramp-i = to crawl.

ROBERTO BRUCE KAJ LA ARANEO.    Oni rakontas la sekvantan interesan rakonton pri Roberto Bruce, regxo  antaux multaj jaroj en Skotlando. Okazis ke li estis rigardanta la  soldataron de siaj malamikoj, de la fenestro de granda cxevalejo.  Por povi rigardi plej facile, kaj ankaux por sin kasxi, li forsendis  siajn soldatojn kaj restis la tutan tagon sub tiu tegmento. Kvankam la  cxevalejo estis granda gxi estis malnova, kaj li opiniis ke la malamikoj  ne sercxos lin tie. Je la fino de la tago li subite rimarkis araneon  sur la muro apud si. La araneo estis rampanta supren, sed baldaux gxi  falis en la polvon cxe liaj piedoj. Tuj la falinta araneo komencis  alian fojon supren rampi. Alian fojon gxi falis teren, sed post ne  longe gxi komencis rampi alian fojon. \"Kia pacienco!\" diris la regxo al  si. \"Mi ne sciis ke la araneo havas tiel multe da pacienco! Sed kien  gxi nun estas falinta?\" Li rigardis cxirkauxen kaj fine (\"finally\")  li vidis la falintan araneon. Kun granda surprizo li rimarkis ke gxi  estas komencanta supren rampi. Multajn fojojn gxi supren rampis, kaj  tiom da fojoj gxi falis malsupren. Fine, tamen, gxi sukcese rampis  gxis la plafono. La regxo malfermis la busxon pro surprizo, kaj diris  al si \"Kiam antauxe mi vidis tiom da pacienco! Mi opinias ke la fina  sukceso de tiu malgranda araneo donas al mi bonegan lecionon. Mi estas  ofte malsukcesinta, sed malpli ofte ol tiu araneo sur la muro. Mi estas  perdinta multe da soldatoj, kaj la malamikoj estas venkintaj multajn  fojojn, cxar ili havas multe pli grandan nombron da soldatoj. Tamen, mi  estos pacienca, cxar oni ne scias kiam li fine sukcesos.\" La sekvintan  tagon, la regxo Roberto Bruce komencis treege labori kontraux siaj  malamikoj. Post mallonga tempo li bone sukcesis, kaj tute venkis la  malamikoj en granda venko cxe Bannockburn (Banokb'rn).                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. Although the enemies of Robert Bruce conquered him many times, he  finally conquered them in Scotland, because he was patient and very  courageous. 2. He was sitting in a large stable, to hide (himself), and  also in order to (98) look directly from its roof (at) the soldiery  (126) of the enemy. 3. At the end of the day he noticed a spider  crawling up (ward) on the wall. 4. The spider fell suddenly into the  dust and lay at the king's feet, but soon began to crawl up. 5. \"Where  does it wish to go?\" said the king to himself. 6. \"What patience it  shows! It has crawled up and fallen down a great many times.\" 7. Finally  however the spider succeeded, and crawled up to the ceiling. 8. The  king said that he had learned a lesson from the patient spider. 9. He  said \"Although the enemy have conquered many times, because they have a  larger number of soldiers, I shall finally succeed against them.\" 10.  Soon it happened that the wind blew violently, and a rainstorm occurred.  11. The blast shook the foliage (126) on the trees, and broke away many  small branches. 12. A group of soldiers ran right (\"rekte\") toward the  stable, and Robert Bruce was much afraid that they would find him. 13.  But they merely stole the horses there, and rode away.                                     LESSON XXVIII.                   THE INTERROGATIVE ADVERB OF MOTIVE OR REASON.    129. The interrogative adverb of motive or reason related to the  interrogative pronoun \"kiu\" is \"kial\", why, wherefore, for what  reason:       Kial la araneo supren rampis? why did the spider crawl up?     Mi demandos kial li rimarkis gxin, I will ask why he noticed it.                             THE INFINITIVE AS SUBJECT.    130. The infinitive may be used as the subject of a verb.    [Footnote: Cf. the complementary infinitive (28), equivalent to the  object of a verb, and the use of the infinitive after the prepositions  \"por\", \"anstataux\", \"antaux ol\" (98).]      Any modifier of the infinitive is necessarily adverbial. An indefinite  personal object (or pronominal complement of a preposition) after an  infinitive used as subject is expressed by the reflexive pronoun \"si\":       Promeni estas granda plezuro, to go walking is a great pleasure.     Promeni estas agrable, to go walking is pleasant.     Cxu estas facile rigardi la plafonon?        Is it easy to look at the ceiling?     Estas bone sin helpi, it is well to help oneself.     Paroli al si estas malsagxe, to talk to oneself is silly.                        PRESENT ACTION WITH PAST INCEPTION.    131. A present act or state which began in the past is expressed by the  present tense (instead of by the past as in English):       Mi estas cxi tie de lundo, I have been (I am) here since Monday.     De Marto mi studas tiun lingvon,        since March I have been (I am) studying that language.     Ili estas amikoj de tiu tago,        they have been (they are) friends from that day.     Ni logxas tie de antaux kelkaj monatoj,        we have been living (we are living) here since some months ago.    [Footnote: Cf. German \"er ist schon lange hier\", he has already been  here a long time, French \"je suis ici depuis deux ans\", I have been here  two years, etc.]                                 THE SUFFIX \"-UL-\".    132. The suffix \"-ul-\" is used to form nouns indicating a person  characterized by or possessing the distinguishing trait, character or  quality in the root:       junulo, a youth, a young man (from \"juna\", young).     belulino, a beauty, a belle (from \"bela\", beautiful).     maljunulo, an old man (from \"maljuna\", old).     sagxulo, a sage, a wise man (from \"saga\", wise).     malricxulino, a poor woman (from \"malricxa\", poor).    [Footnote: Cf. the English adjectives \"quer-ul-ous\", \"cred-ul-ous\",  \"garr-ul-ous\", etc., and the Latin nouns \"fam-ul-us\", a servant,  \"fig-ul-us\", a potter, and \"leg-ul-us\", a gatherer.]                              \"LOGXI\" AND \"VIVI\".    133. The verb \"logxi\", \"to reside, to dwell, to lodge\", must not be  confused with \"vivi\", which means \"to live\" in the sense of \"to be  alive\":       Li logxas apude, he lives near by.     Li vivis longan tempon, he lived a long time.     Vivi felicxe estas pli bone ol logxi ricxe,        to live happily is better than to live (lodge) richly.                                     VOCABULARY       afabl-a = amiable, affable.        kial = why (129).     afer-o = thing, matter, affair.    mejl-o = mile.     balanc-i = to balance, to nod.     okulhar-o = eyelash.     barb-o = beard.                    okulvitr-oj = spectacles.     batal-o = battle.                  pens-i = to think, to ponder.     brov-o = eyebrow.                  vang-o = cheek.     bukl-o = curl (of hair).           verand-o = porch, veranda.     har-o = hair.                      viv-i = to live (133).                              PRI LA AVO KAJ LA AVINO.    Mia avo estas tre afabla persono. Li estas maljunulo kun blankaj haroj  kaj blanka barbo. Li havas bluajn okulojn, kaj la brovoj super ili estas  ecx pli blankaj ol liaj haroj. Kvankam li logxas en nia vilagxo de  antaux kelkaj jaroj, li antauxe logxis en Skotlando. Antaux multaj jaroj  li estis soldato, kaj li ofte parolas al mi pri la bataloj kaj venkoj  de tiu tempo. Sidi kviete sur la verando kaj rakonti tiajn rakontojn al  la nepo sxajne donas al li multe da plezuro. Multajn fojojn je la fino  de la tago li sidas tie, kaj parolas pri tiaj aferoj gxis malfrua horo  de la vespero. Sidi cxe liaj piedoj kaj auxdi liajn rakontojn estas  tre interese al mi. Komence, dum mi estas cxe li, mi kutime demandas  \"Cxu oni sukcesis en tiu batalo?\" Tuj li balancas la kapon kaj komencas  pacience rakonti pri la venkoj kaj malvenkoj (\"defeats\"). Li malofte  respondas \"Mi ne scias,\" al miaj demandoj \"Kiam,\" kaj \"Kial.\" Kelkajn  fojojn li diras \"Mi havas tiun opinion, sed mi ne bone scias pri la  tuta afero, kaj mi miras cxu aliaj personoj scias pli bone.\" Cxar li  estas multe studinta kaj pensinta, liaj opinioj estas treege interesaj.  Li gxojas tial ke mi demandas pri aferoj okazintaj (\"things that have"]]]
