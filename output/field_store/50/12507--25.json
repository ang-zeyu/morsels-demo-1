Their mind seems to  them to be practically \"a something belonging to\" their body-which in  many cases it is indeed.    But as man rises in the scale of consciousness he is able to disentangle  his \"Me\" from his idea of body, and is able to think of his body as  \"belonging to\" the mental part of him. But even then he is very apt to  identify the \"Me\" entirely with the mental states, feelings, etc., which  he feels to exist within him. He is very apt to consider these internal  states as identical with himself, instead of their being simply \"things\"  produced by some part of his mentality, and existing within him--of him,  and in him, but still not \"himself.\" He sees that he may change these  internal states of feelings by all effort of will, and that he may  produce a feeling or state of an exactly opposite nature, in the same  way, and yet the same \"Me\" exists. And so after a while he is able to  set aside these various mental states, emotions, feelings, habits,  qualities, characteristics, and other personal mental belongings--he is  able to set them aside in the \"not-me\" collection of curiosities and  encumbrances, as well as valuable possessions. This requires much mental  concentration and power of mental analysis on the part of the student.  But still the task is possible for the advanced student, and even those  not so far advanced are able to see, in the imagination, how the process  may be performed.    After this laying-aside process has been performed, the student will  find himself in conscious possession of a \"Self\" which may be considered  in its \"I\" and \"Me\" dual aspects. The \"Me\" will be felt to be a  Something mental in which thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and other  mental states may be produced. It may be considered as the \"mental  womb,\" as the ancients styled it-capable of generating mental offspring.  It reports to the consciousness as a \"Me\" with latent powers of creation  and generation of mental progeny of all sorts and kinds. Its powers of  creative energy are felt to be enormous. But still it seems to be  conscious that it must receive some form of energy from either its \"I\"  companion, or else from some other \"I\" ere it is able to bring into  being its mental creations. This consciousness brings with it a  realization of an enormous capacity for mental work and creative  ability.    But the student soon finds that this is not all that he finds within his  inner consciousness. He finds that there exists a mental Something which  is able to Will that the \"Me\" act along certain creative lines, and  which is also able to stand aside and witness the mental creation. This  part of himself he is taught to call his \"I.\" He is able to rest in its  consciousness at will. He finds there not a consciousness of an ability  to generate and actively create, in the sense of the gradual process  attendant upon mental operations, but rather a sense and consciousness  of an ability to project an energy from the \"I\" to the \"Me\"--a process  of \"willing\" that the mental creation begin and proceed. He also finds  that the \"I\" is able to stand aside and witness the operations of the  \"Me's\" mental creation and generation. There is this dual aspect in the  mind of every person. The \"I\" represents the Masculine Principle of  Mental Gender-the \"Me\" represents the Female Principle. The \"I\"  represents the Aspect of Being; the \"Me\" the Aspect of Becoming. You  will notice that the Principle of Correspondence operates on this plane  just as it does upon the great plane upon which the creation of  Universes is performed. The two are similar in kind, although  vastly different in degree. \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"    These aspects of mind-the Masculine and Feminine Principles-the \"I\" and  the \"Me\"-considered in connection with the well-known mental and psychic  phenomena, give the master-key to these dimly known regions of mental  operation and manifestation. The principle of Mental Gender gives the  truth underlying the whole field of the phenomena of mental influence,  etc.    The tendency of the Feminine Principle is always in the direction of  receiving impressions, while the tendency of the Masculine Principle is  always in the direction of giving, out or expressing. The Feminine  Principle has much more varied field of operation than has the Masculine  Principle. The Feminine Principle conducts the work of generating new  thoughts, concepts, ideas, including the work of the imagination. The  Masculine Principle contents itself with the work of the \"Will\" in its  varied phases. And yet, without the active aid of the Will of the  Masculine Principle, the Feminine Principle is apt to rest content with  generating mental images which are the result of impressions received  from outside, instead of producing original mental creations.    Persons who can give continued attention and thought to a subject  actively employ both of the Mental Principles-the Feminine in the work  of the mental generation, and the Masculine Will in stimulating and  energizing the creative portion of the mind. The majority of persons  really employ the Masculine Principle but little, and are content to  live according to the thoughts and ideas instilled into the \"Me\" from  the \"I\" of other minds. But it is not our purpose to dwell upon this  phase of the subject, which may be studied from any good text-book upon  psychology, with the key that we have given you regarding Mental Gender.    The student of Psychic Phenomena is aware of the wonderful phenomena  classified under the head of Telepathy; Thought Transference; Mental  Influence; Suggestion; Hypnotism, etc. Many have sought for an  explanation of these varied phases of phenomena under the theories of  the various \"dual mind\" teachers. And in a measure they are right, for  there is clearly a manifestation of two distinct phases of mental  activity. But if such students will consider these \"dual minds\" in the  light of the Hermetic Teachings regarding Vibrations and Mental Gender,  they will see that the long sought for key is at hand.    In the phenomena of Telepathy it is seen how the Vibratory Energy of the  Masculine Principle is projected toward the Feminine Principle of  another person, and the latter takes the seed-thought and allows it to  develop into maturity. In the same way Suggestion and Hypnotism  operates. The Masculine Principle of the person giving the suggestions  directs a stream of Vibratory Energy or Will-Power toward the Feminine  Principle of the other person, and the latter accepting it makes it its  own and acts and thinks accordingly. An idea thus lodged in the mind of  another person grows and develops, and in time is regarded as the  rightful mental offspring of the individual, whereas it is in reality  like the cuckoo egg placed in the sparrows nest, where it destroys the  rightful offspring and makes itself at home. The normal method is for  the Masculine and Feminine Principles in a person's mind to co-ordinate  and act harmoniously in conjunction with each other, but, unfortunately,  the Masculine Principle in the average person is too lazy to act-the  display of Will-Power is too slight-and the consequence is that such  persons are ruled almost entirely by the minds and wills of other  persons, whom they allow to do their thinking and willing for them.  How few original thoughts or original actions are performed by the  average person? Are not the majority of persons mere shadows and echoes  of others having stronger wills or minds than themselves? The trouble is  that the average person dwells almost altogether in his \"Me\"  consciousness and does not realize that he has such a thing as an \"I.\"  He is polarized in his Feminine Principle of Mind, and the Masculine  Principle, in which is lodged the Will, is allowed to remain inactive  and not employed.    The strong men and women of the world invariably manifest the Masculine  Principle of Will, and their strength depends materially upon this fact.  Instead of living upon the impressions made upon their minds by others,  they dominate their own minds by their Will, obtaining the kind of  mental images desired, and moreover dominate the minds of others  likewise, in the same manner. Look at the strong people, how they manage  to implant their seed-thoughts in the minds of the masses of the people,  thus causing the latter to think thoughts in accordance with the desires  and wills of the strong individuals. This is why the masses of people  are such sheeplike creatures, never originating an idea of their own,  nor using their own powers of mental activity.    The manifestation of Mental Gender may be noticed all around us in  everyday life. The magnetic persons are those who are able to use the  Masculine Principle in the way of impressing their ideas upon others.  The actor who makes people weep or cry as he wills, is employing this  principle. And so is the successful orator, statesman, preacher, writer  or other people who are before the public attention. The peculiar  influence exerted by some people over others is due to the manifestation  of Mental Gender, along the Vibrational lines above indicated. In this  principle lies the secret of personal magnetism, personal influence,  fascination, etc., as well as the phenomena generally grouped under the  name of Hypnotism.    The student who has familiarized himself with the phenomena generally  spoken of as \"psychic\" will have discovered the important part played in  the said phenomena by that force which science has styled \"Suggestion,\"  by which term is meant the process or method whereby an idea is  transferred to, or \"impressed upon\" the mind of another, causing the  second mind to act in accordance therewith. A correct understanding of  Suggestion is necessary in order to intelligently comprehend the varied  psychical phenomena which Suggestion underlies. But, still more is a  knowledge of Vibration and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#19)"],[1," observations and the conclusions  founded on them, did not bear much fruit until the time of Lavoisier,  that is, towards the close of the 18th century. They were overshadowed  and put aside by the work of Stahl (1660-1724). Some of the alchemists  of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries taught that combustion and  calcination are processes wherein _the igneous principle_ is  destroyed, using the word \"destroyed\" in its alchemical meaning. This  description of processes of burning was much more in keeping with the  ideas of the time than that given by Boyle, Rey and Mayow. It was  adopted by Stahl, and made the basis of a general theory of those  changes wherein one substance disappears and another, or others, very  unlike it, are produced.    That he might bring into one point of view, and compare the various  changes effected by the agency of fire, Stahl invented a new  Principle, which he named _Phlogiston_, and constructed an hypothesis  which is generally known as the phlogistic theory. He explained, and  applied, this hypothesis in various books, especially in one published  at Halle in 1717.    Stahl observed that many substances which differed much from one  another in various respects were alike in one respect; they were all  combustible. All the combustible substances, he argued, must contain a  common principle; he named this supposed principle, _phlogiston_ (from  the Greek word _phlogistos_ = burnt, or set on fire). Stahl said that  the phlogiston of a combustible thing escapes as the substance burns,  and, becoming apparent to the senses, is named fire or flame. The  phlogiston in a combustible substance was supposed to be so  intimately associated with something else that our senses cannot  perceive it; nevertheless, the theory said, it is there; we can see  only the escaping phlogiston, we can perceive only the phlogiston  which is set free from its combination with other things. The theory  thought of phlogiston as imprisoned in the thing which can be burnt,  and as itself forming part of the prison; that the prisoner should be  set free, the walls of the prison had to be removed; the freeing of  the prisoner destroyed the prison. As escaping, or free, phlogiston  was called fire, or flame, so the phlogiston in a combustible  substance was sometimes called combined fire, or flame in the state of  combination. A peculiarity of the strange thing called phlogiston was  that it preferred to be concealed in something, hidden, imprisoned,  combined; free phlogiston* was supposed to be always ready to become  combined phlogiston.       *Transcriber's Note: Original \"phlogstion\".    The phlogistic theory said that what remains when a substance has been  burnt is the original substance deprived of phlogiston; and,  therefore, to restore the phlogiston to the product of burning is to  re-form the combustible substance. But how is such a restoration of  phlogiston to be accomplished? Evidently by heating the burnt thing  with something which is very ready to burn. Because, according to the  theory, everything which can be burnt contains phlogiston, the more  ready a substance is to burn the richer it is in phlogiston; burning  is the outrush of phlogiston, phlogiston prefers to be combined with  something; therefore, if you mix what remains after burning, with  something which is very combustible, and heat the mixture, you are  bringing the burnt matter under conditions which are very favourable  for the reception of phlogiston by it, for you are bringing it into  intimate contact with something from which freedom-hating phlogiston  is being forced to escape.    Charcoal, sulphur, phosphorus, oils and fats are easily burnt; these  substances were, therefore, chosen for the purpose of changing things  which had been burnt into things which could again be burnt; these,  and a few other substances like these, were classed together, and  called _phlogisticating agents_.    Very many of the substances which were dealt with by the experimenters  of the last quarter of the 17th, and the first half of the 18th,  century, were either substances which could be burned, or those which  had been produced by burning; hence the phlogistic theory brought into  one point of view, compared, and emphasised the similarities between,  a great many things which had not been thought of as connected before  that theory was promulgated. Moreover, the theory asserted that all  combustible, or incinerable, things are composed of phlogiston, and  another principle, or, as was often said, another element, which is  different in different kinds of combustible substances. The metals,  for instance, were said to be composed of phlogiston and an earthy  principle or element, which was somewhat different in different  metals. The phlogisteans taught that the earthy principle of a metal  remains in the form of ash, cinders, or calx, when the metal is  calcined, or, as they expressed it, when the metal is deprived of its  phlogiston.    The phlogistic theory savoured of alchemy; it postulated an undefined,  undefinable, intangible Principle; it said that all combustible  substances are formed by the union of this Principle with another,  which is sometimes of an earthy character, sometimes of a fatty  nature, sometimes highly volatile in habit. Nevertheless, the theory  of Stahl was a step away from purely alchemical conceptions towards  the accurate description of a very important class of changes. The  principle of phlogiston could be recognised by the senses as it was in  the act of escaping from a substance; and the other principle of  combustible things was scarcely a Principle in the alchemical sense,  for, in the case of metals at any rate, it remained when the things  which had contained it were burnt, and could be seen, handled, and  weighed. To say that metals are composed of phlogiston and an earthy  substance, was to express facts in such a language that the expression  might be made the basis of experimental inquiry; it was very different  from the assertion that metals are produced by the spiritual actions  of the three Principles, salt, mercury and sulphur, the first of which  is not salt, the second is not mercury, and the third is not sulphur.  The followers of Stahl often spoke of metals as composed of phlogiston  and an _element_ of an earthy character; this expression also was an  advance, from the hazy notion of _Element_ in purely alchemical  writings, towards accuracy and fulness of description. An element was  now something which could he seen and experimented with; it was no  longer a semi-spiritual existence which could not be grasped by the  senses.    The phlogistic theory regarded the calcination of a metal as the  separation of it into two things, unlike the metal, and unlike each  other; one of these things was phlogiston, the other was an earth-like  residue. The theory thought of the re-formation of a metal from its  calx, that is, the earthy substance which remains after combustion, as  the combination of two things to produce one, apparently homogeneous,  substance. Metals appeared to the phlogisteans, as they appeared to  the alchemists, to be composite substances. Processes of burning were  regarded by alchemists and phlogisteans alike, as processes of  simplification.    The fact had been noticed and recorded, during the middle ages, that  the earth-like matter which remains when a metal is calcined is  heavier than the metal itself. From this fact, modern investigators of  natural phenomena would draw the conclusion, that calcination of a  metal is an addition of something to the metal, not a separation of  the metal into different things. It seems impossible to us that a  substance should be separated into portions, and one of these parts  should weigh as much as, or more than, the whole.    The exact investigation of material changes called chemistry rests on  the statement that _mass_, and mass is practically measured by  _weight_, is the one property of what we call matter, the  determination whereof enables us to decide whether a change is a  combination, or coalescence, of different things, or a separation of  one thing into parts. That any part of a material system can be  removed without the weight of the portion which remains being less  than the original weight of the whole system, is unthinkable, in the  present state of our knowledge of material changes.    But in the 17th century, and throughout most of the 18th, only a few  of those who examined changes in the properties of substances paid  heed to changes of weight; they had not realised the importance of the  property of mass, as measured by weight. The convinced upholder of the  phlogistic theory had two answers to the argument, that, because the  earth-like product of the calcination of a metal weighs more than the  metal itself, therefore the metal cannot have lost something in the  process; for, if one portion of what is taken away weighs more than  the metal from which it has been separated, it is evident that the  weight of the two portions into which the metal is said to have been  divided must be considerably greater than the weight of the undivided  metal. The upholders of the theory sometimes met the argument by  saying, \"Of course the calx weighs more than the metal, because  phlogiston tends to lighten a body which contains it; and therefore  the body weighs more after it has lost phlogiston than it did when the  phlogiston formed part of it;\" sometimes, and more often, their answer  was--\"loss or gain of weight is an accident, the essential thing is  change of qualities.\"    If the argument against the separation of a metal into two  constituents, by calcination, were answered to-day as it was answered  by the upholders of the phlogistic theory, in the middle of the 18th  century, the answers would justly be considered inconsequent and  ridiculous. But it does not follow that the statements were either  far-fetched or"]]]
