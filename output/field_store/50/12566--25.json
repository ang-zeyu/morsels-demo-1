[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1557"],[0,"Men of Iron (#19)"],[1," such marvellous strange happenings befall him  as thou.\"      Whenever the opportunity occurred for sending a letter to Crosbey-Holt,  Myles wrote one to his mother; and one can guess how they were treasured  by the good lady, and read over and over again to the blind old Lord as  he sat staring into darkness with his sightless eyes.    About the time of this escapade he wrote a letter telling of those  doings, wherein, after speaking of his misadventure of falling from the  wall, and of his acquaintance with the young ladies, he went on to speak  of the matter in which he repeated his visits. The letter was worded  in the English of that day--the quaint and crabbed language in which  Chaucer wrote. Perhaps few boys could read it nowadays, so, modernizing  it somewhat, it ran thus:    \"And now to let ye weet that thing that followed that happening that  made me acquaint with they two young Damoiselles. I take me to the south  wall of that garden one day four and twenty great spikes, which Peter  Smith did forge for me and for which I pay him fivepence, and that all  the money that I had left of my half-year's wage, and wot not where I  may get more at these present, withouten I do betake me to Sir James,  who, as I did tell ye, hath consented to hold those moneys that Prior  Edward gave me till I need them.    \"Now these same spikes, I say, I take me them down behind the corner of  the wall, and there drave them betwixt the stones, my very dear comrade  and true friend Gascoyne holping me thereto to do. And so come Saturday,  I climb me over the wall and to the roof of the tool-house below,  seeking a fitting opportunity when I might so do without being in too  great jeopardy.    \"Yea; and who should be there but they two ladies, biding my coming,  who, seeing me, made as though they had expected me not, and gave me  greatest rebuke for adventuring so moughtily. Yet, methinks, were they  right well pleasured that I should so aventure, which indeed I might not  otherwise do, seeing as I have telled to thee, that one of them is mine  own true lady for to serven, and so was the only way that I might come  to speech with her.\"    Such was Myles's own quaint way of telling how he accomplished his aim  of visiting the forbidden garden, and no doubt the smack of adventure  and the savor of danger in the undertaking recommended him not a little  to the favor of the young ladies.    After this first acquaintance perhaps a month passed, during which Myles  had climbed the wall some half a dozen times (for the Lady Anne  would not permit of too frequent visits), and during which the first  acquaintance of the three ripened rapidly to an honest, pleasant  friendship. More than once Myles, when in Lord George's train, caught  a covert smile or half nod from one or both of the girls, not a little  delightful in its very secret friendliness.        CHAPTER 19    As was said, perhaps a month passed; then Myles's visits came to an  abrupt termination, and with it ended, in a certain sense, a chapter of  his life.    One Saturday afternoon he climbed the garden wall, and skirting behind  a long row of rosebushes that screened him from the Countess's terrace,  came to a little summer-house where the two young ladies had appointed  to meet him that day.    A pleasant half-hour or so was passed, and then it was time for Myles  to go. He lingered for a while before he took his final leave, leaning  against the door-post, and laughingly telling how he and some of his  brother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in men's clothes, and  had played a trick with it one night upon a watchman against whom they  bore a grudge.    The young ladies were listening with laughing faces, when suddenly, as  Myles looked, he saw the smile vanish from Lady Alice's eyes and a wide  terror take its place. She gave a half-articulate cry, and rose abruptly  from the bench upon which she was sitting.    Myles turned sharply, and then his very heart seemed to stand still  within him; for there, standing in the broad sunlight without, and  glaring in upon the party with baleful eyes, was the Earl of Mackworth  himself.    How long was the breathless silence that followed, Myles could never  tell. He knew that the Lady Anne had also risen, and that she and her  cousin were standing as still as statues. Presently the Earl pointed to  the house with his staff, and Myles noted stupidly how it trembled in  his hand.    \"Ye wenches,\" said he at last, in a hard, harsh voice--\"ye wenches, what  meaneth this? Would ye deceive me so, and hold parlance thus secretly  with this fellow? I will settle with him anon. Meantime get ye  straightway to the house and to your rooms, and there abide until I give  ye leave to come forth again. Go, I say!\"    \"Father,\" said Lady Anne, in a breathless voice--she was as white as  death, and moistened her lips with her tongue before she spoke--\"father,  thou wilt not do harm to this young man. Spare him, I do beseech thee,  for truly it was I who bade him come hither. I know that he would not  have come but at our bidding.\"    The Earl stamped his foot upon the gravel. \"Did ye not hear me?\" said  he, still pointing towards the house with his trembling staff. \"I bade  ye go to your rooms. I will settle with this fellow, I say, as I deem  fitting.\"    \"Father,\" began Lady Anne again; but the Earl made such a savage gesture  that poor Lady Alice uttered a faint shriek, and Lady Anne stopped  abruptly, trembling. Then she turned and passed out the farther door of  the summerhouse, poor little Lady Alice following, holding her tight  by the skirts, and trembling and shuddering as though with a fit of the  ague.    The Earl stood looking grimly after them from under his shaggy eyebrows,  until they passed away behind the yew-trees, appeared again upon the  terrace behind, entered the open doors of the women's house, and were  gone. Myles heard their footsteps growing fainter and fainter, but he  never raised his eyes. Upon the ground at his feet were four pebbles,  and he noticed how they almost made a square, and would do so if he  pushed one of them with his toe, and then it seemed strange to him that  he should think of such a little foolish thing at that dreadful time.    He knew that the Earl was looking gloomily at him, and that his face  must be very pale. Suddenly Lord Mackworth spoke. \"What hast thou to  say?\" said he, harshly.    Then Myles raised his eyes, and the Earl smiled grimly as he looked his  victim over. \"I have naught to say,\" said the lad, huskily.    \"Didst thou not hear what my daughter spake but now?\" said the Earl.  \"She said that thou came not of thy own free-will; what sayst thou to  that, sirrah--is it true?\"    Myles hesitated for a moment or two; his throat was tight and dry.  \"Nay,\" said he at last, \"she belieth herself. It was I who first came  into the garden. I fell by chance from the tree yonder--I was seeking  a ball--then I asked those two if I might not come hither again, and so  have done some several times in all. But as for her--nay; it was not at  her bidding that I came, but through mine own asking.\"    The Earl gave a little grunt in his throat. \"And how often hast thou  been here?\" said he, presently.    Myles thought a moment or two. \"This maketh the seventh time,\" said he.    Another pause of silence followed, and Myles began to pluck up some  heart that maybe all would yet be well. The Earl's next speech dashed  that hope into a thousand fragments. \"Well thou knowest,\" said he, \"that  it is forbid for any to come here. Well thou knowest that twice have men  been punished for this thing that thou hast done, and yet thou camest in  spite of all. Now dost thou know what thou wilt suffer?\"    Myles picked with nervous fingers at a crack in the oaken post against  which he leaned. \"Mayhap thou wilt kill me,\" said he at last, in a dull,  choking voice.    Again the Earl smiled a grim smile. \"Nay,\" said he, \"I would not slay  thee, for thou hast gentle blood. But what sayest thou should I shear  thine ears from thine head, or perchance have thee scourged in the great  court?\"    The sting of the words sent the blood flying back to Myles's face again,  and he looked quickly up. \"Nay,\" said he, with a boldness that surprised  himself; \"thou shalt do no such unlordly thing upon me as that. I be thy  peer, sir, in blood; and though thou mayst kill me, thou hast no right  to shame me.\"    Lord Mackworth bowed with a mocking courtesy. \"Marry!\" said he.  \"Methought it was one of mine own saucy popinjay squires that I caught  sneaking here and talking to those two foolish young lasses, and lo! it  is a young Lord--or mayhap thou art a young Prince--and commandeth  me that I shall not do this and I shall not do that. I crave your  Lordship's honorable pardon, if I have said aught that may have galled  you.\"    The fear Myles had felt was now beginning to dissolve in rising wrath.  \"Nay,\" said he, stoutly, \"I be no Lord and I be no Prince, but I be as  good as thou. For am I not the son of thy onetime very true comrade and  thy kinsman--to wit, the Lord Falworth, whom, as thou knowest, is poor  and broken, and blind, and helpless, and outlawed, and banned? Yet,\"  cried he, grinding his teeth, as the thought of it all rushed in upon  him, \"I would rather be in his place than in yours; for though he be  ruined, you--\"    He had just sense enough to stop there.    The Earl, gripping his staff behind his back, and with his head a little  bent, was looking keenly at the lad from under his shaggy gray brows.  \"Well,\" said he, as Myles stopped, \"thou hast gone too far now to draw  back. Say thy say to the end. Why wouldst thou rather be in thy father's  stead than in mine?\"    Myles did not answer.    \"Thou shalt finish thy speech, or else show thyself a coward. Though thy  father is ruined, thou didst say I am--what?\"    Myles keyed himself up to the effort, and then blurted out, \"Thou art  attainted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#19)"],[1,"somehow, God only knows how, in doing our duty as Rangers we may yet be  doing right by these two innocent girls. I ask you, as my friend, please  do not speak again to me of--Miss Sampson.\"    I left him and went up the quiet trail with the thick shadows all around  me and the cold stars overhead; and I was sober in thought, sick at  heart for him as much as for myself, and I tortured my mind in fruitless  conjecture as to what the end of this strange and fateful adventure  would be.    I discovered that less and less the old wild spirit abided with me and I  become conscious of a dull, deep-seated ache in my breast, a pang in the  bone.    From that day there was a change in Diane Sampson. She became feverishly  active. She wanted to ride, to see for herself what was going on in  Linrock, to learn of that wild Pecos county life at first hand.    She made such demands on my time now that I scarcely ever found an hour  to be with or near Steele until after dark. However, as he was playing a  waiting game on the rustlers, keeping out of the resorts for the  present, I had not great cause for worry. Hoden was slowly gathering men  together, a band of trustworthy ones, and until this organization was  complete and ready, Steele thought better to go slow.    It was of little use for me to remonstrate with Miss Sampson when she  refused to obey a distracted and angry father. I began to feel sorry for  Sampson. He was an unscrupulous man, but he loved this daughter who  belonged to another and better and past side of his life.    I heard him appeal to her to go back to Louisiana; to let him take her  home, giving as urgent reason the probability of trouble for him. She  could not help, could only handicap him.    She agreed to go, provided he sold his property, took the best of his  horses and went with her back to the old home to live there the rest of  their lives. He replied with considerable feeling that he wished he  could go, but it was impossible. Then that settled the matter for her,  she averred.    Failing to persuade her to leave Linrock, he told her to keep to the  ranch. Naturally, in spite of his anger, Miss Sampson refused to obey;  and she frankly told him that it was the free, unfettered life of the  country, the riding here and there that appealed so much to her.    Sampson came to me a little later and his worn face showed traces of  internal storm.    \"Russ, for a while there I wanted to get rid of you,\" he said. \"I've  changed. Diane always was a spoiled kid. Now she's a woman. Something's  fired her blood. Maybe it's this damned wild country. Anyway, she's got  the bit between her teeth. She'll run till she's run herself out.    \"Now, it seems the safety of Diane, and Sally, too, has fallen into your  hands. The girls won't have one of my cowboys near them. Lately they've  got shy of George, too. Between you and me I want to tell you that  conditions here in Pecos are worse than they've seemed since you-all  reached the ranch. But bad work will break out again--it's coming soon.    \"I can't stop it. The town will be full of the hardest gang in western  Texas. My daughter and Sally would not be safe if left alone to go  anywhere. With you, perhaps, they'll be safe. Can I rely on you?\"    \"Yes, Sampson, you sure can,\" I replied. \"I'm on pretty good terms with  most everybody in town. I think I can say none of the tough set who hang  out down there would ever made any move while I'm with the girls. But  I'll be pretty careful to avoid them, and particularly strange fellows  who may come riding in.    \"And if any of them do meet us and start trouble, I'm going for my gun,  that's all. There won't be any talk.\"    \"Good! I'll back you,\" Sampson replied. \"Understand, Russ, I didn't want  you here, but I always had you sized up as a pretty hard nut, a man not  to be trifled with. You've got a bad name. Diane insists the name's not  deserved. She'd trust you with herself under any circumstances. And the  kid, Sally, she'd be fond of you if it wasn't for the drink. Have you  been drunk a good deal? Straight now, between you and me.\"    \"Not once,\" I replied.    \"George's a liar then. He's had it in for you since that day at  Sanderson. Look out you two don't clash. He's got a temper, and when  he's drinking he's a devil. Keep out of his way.\"    \"I've stood a good deal from Wright, and guess I can stand more.\"    \"All right, Russ,\" he continued, as if relieved. \"Chuck the drink and  cards for a while and keep an eye on the girls. When my affairs  straighten out maybe I'll make you a proposition.\"    Sampson left me material for thought. Perhaps it was not only the  presence of a Ranger in town that gave him concern, nor the wilfulness  of his daughter. There must be internal strife in the rustler gang with  which we had associated him.    Perhaps a menace of publicity, rather than risk, was the cause of the  wearing strain on him. I began to get a closer insight into Sampson, and  in the absence of any conclusive evidence of his personal baseness I  felt pity for him.    In the beginning he had opposed me just because I did not happen to be a  cowboy he had selected. This latest interview with me, amounting in some  instances to confidence, proved absolutely that he had not the slightest  suspicion that I was otherwise than the cowboy I pretended to be.    Another interesting deduction was that he appeared to be out of patience  with Wright. In fact, I imagined I sensed something of fear and distrust  in this spoken attitude toward his relative. Not improbably here was the  internal strife between Sampson and Wright, and there flashed into my  mind, absolutely without reason, an idea that the clash was over Diane  Sampson.    I scouted this intuitive idea as absurd; but, just the same, it refused  to be dismissed.    As I turned my back on the coarse and exciting life in the saloons and  gambling hells, and spent all my time except when sleeping, out in the  windy open under blue sky and starry heaven, my spirit had an uplift.    I was glad to be free of that job. It was bad enough to have to go into  these dens to arrest men, let alone living with them, almost being one.    Diane Sampson noted a change in me, attributed it to the absence of the  influence of drink, and she was glad. Sally made no attempt to conceal  her happiness; and to my dismay, she utterly failed to keep her promise  not to tease or tempt me further.    She was adorable, distracting.    We rode every day and almost all day. We took our dinner and went clear  to the foothills to return as the sun set. We visited outlying ranches,  water-holes, old adobe houses famous in one way or another as scenes of  past fights of rustlers and ranchers.    We rode to the little village of Sampson, and half-way to Sanderson, and  all over the country.    There was no satisfying Miss Sampson with rides, new places, new faces,  new adventures. And every time we rode out she insisted on first riding  through Linrock; and every time we rode home she insisted on going back  that way.    We visited all the stores, the blacksmith, the wagon shop, the feed and  grain houses--everywhere that she could find excuse for visiting. I had  to point out to her all the infamous dens in town, and all the lawless  and lounging men we met.    She insisted upon being shown the inside of the Hope So, to the extreme  confusion of that bewildered resort.    I pretended to be blind to this restless curiosity. Sally understood the  cause, too, and it divided her between a sweet gravity and a naughty  humor.    The last, however, she never evinced in sight or hearing of Diane.    It seemed that we were indeed fated to cross the path of Vaughn Steele.  We saw him working round his adobe house; then we saw him on horseback.  Once we met him face to face in a store.    He gazed steadily into Diane Sampson's eyes and went his way without any  sign of recognition. There was red in her face when he passed and white  when he had gone.    That day she rode as I had never seen her, risking her life, unmindful  of her horse.    Another day we met Steele down in the valley, where, inquiry discovered  to us, he had gone to the home of an old cattleman who lived alone and  was ill.    Last and perhaps most significant of all these meetings was the one when  we were walking tired horses home through the main street of Linrock and  came upon Steele just in time to see him in action.    It happened at a corner where the usual slouchy, shirt-sleeved loungers  were congregated. They were in high glee over the predicament of one  ruffian who had purchased or been given a poor, emaciated little burro  that was on his last legs. The burro evidently did not want to go with  its new owner, who pulled on a halter and then viciously swung the end  of the rope to make welts on the worn and scarred back.    If there was one thing that Diane Sampson could not bear it was to see  an animal in pain. She passionately loved horses, and hated the sight of  a spur or whip.    When we saw the man beating the little burro she cried out to me:    \"Make the brute stop!\"    I might have made a move had I not on the instant seen Steele heaving  into sight round the corner.    Just then the fellow, whom I now recognized to be a despicable character  named Andrews, began to bestow heavy and brutal kicks upon the body of  the little burro. These kicks sounded deep, hollow, almost like the boom  of a drum.    The burro uttered the strangest sound I ever heard issue from any beast  and it dropped in its tracks with jerking legs that told any horseman  what had happened. Steele saw the last swings of Andrews' heavy boot. He  yelled. It was a sharp yell that would have made anyone start. But it  came too late, for the burro had dropped.    Steele knocked over several of the jeering men to get to Andrews. He  kicked the fellow's feet from under him, sending him hard to the ground.    Then Steele picked up the end"]]]
