The swain must be found and induced to come and join, or supervise,  our squatters.  We cannot let him take her away, for what will the homestead  be without Anna?  I was looking forward to her marrying on the farm  and giving her a superior cottage so that other Kafir girls may see  how profitable it is to be good.  Anna leaving the farm, O, nee wat! (Oh, no).  We must find out who it is; but wait, there is old Gert (her father) coming,  with old Jan (her uncle).  I must find out from them who had been intruding  into the company of their daughters last night.  I should warn them  to be on the alert lest Anna elopes to Potchefstroom with somebody,  probably to take the train and go farther -- to Johannesburg or Kimberley,  as did Klein Mietje, whom I had hoped to train as our housemaid ----\"    \"Good morning, Auta Gert, how is Mietje and the kleintjes (little ones)?\"    Auta Gert's demeanour was a greater puzzle to Mrs. V. than his daughter's  when he replied, \"So, so.\"    Mrs. V. (between horns of the same dilemma):  \"And you, Auta Jan?\"    \"Ja, Missus,\" replied Jan.    Mrs. V.'s perplexity was intense, for it became evident that the two Natives  were there as a deputation, charged with some grave mission.  Before she uttered another word the two Natives asked for an interview.    \"Not to waste much time, Missus,\" began old Gert, \"a thunderbolt has burst  on the native settlement on the farm, and Dashfontein is no longer  a home to us ----\"    \"No longer a home!\" exclaimed Mrs. V.  \"I hope you idiotic Kafirs  are not going to be so foolhardy as to leave me, leave the Baas,  and leave the farm upon which your fathers and mothers lie buried.  Do not you know that during this very week numbers of Natives have been  calling on the Baas, asking him for places of abode, complaining that  they have been turned adrift, with their little ones and their hungry animals,  for refusing to become servants to farmers on whose property  they had been ploughing on shares?  White men have suddenly  become brutes and have expelled Natives with whom they have lived  from childhood -- Natives whose labour made the white man wealthy  are turned away by people who should treat them with gratitude.  And are you going to leave your old home just when the Devil  appears to have possessed himself of the hearts of most farmers?  In your own interest, apart from my own and the Baas's, Auta Gert,  you should have left us long ago when you could find a place elsewhere.  Are you so deaf and blind as not to hear and see the change  which has come over the country of late?  White men formerly punished a Kafir  who had done some wrong, now they worry him from sheer cussedness.  You must be mad, Auta Gert, to try and leave us.  What is going  to become of your family and your beautiful cattle.  No wonder that Anna  is so upset.  I have been thinking that some rondlooper (vagabond)  from the towns had been trying to take her away.\"    As Mrs. V. spoke she was agreeably surprised to find the sobering effect  which her rebuke seemed to have upon her husband's native tenants.  She knew her influence over them, especially over the old native families,  but in all her dealings and close association with them she could not remember  an impromptu speech of hers that produced such immediate results.  The faces of the two Natives brightened up, and they kept  looking at one another as she spoke.  At length she turned round  towards the stoep and there was Anna, for the first time that morning,  interested in and delighted by what she said.  Usually it would have been  a serious breach of the rules of the house for Anna to listen  when the Missus was speaking about something that did not immediately concern  her scullery duties; but Mrs. V.'s satisfaction was unbounded  on seeing the bright look on her servant's face, which she had hitherto  vainly sought.    \"Now, you see,\" said Anna to her father, \"I told you it would never happen  if the Missus can help it.\"    At this, the men could scarcely suppress a laugh.  The Missus  looked round again, and said:    \"Anna, have you Kafirs plotted to fool me this morning?  Because I take  such a deep interest in your welfare, you have so far forgotten yourselves  that you connived with your parents to come over to my house and fool me  on my own farm?  What is the meaning of all this?\"    Auta Gert unfolded his story.  The Baas was at the native settlement  the previous day.  He called a meeting of the native peasants and told them  of the new law, under which no Kafir can buy a farm or hire a farm.  He added that, according to this law, their former relations  of landlord and tenants have been made a criminal offence,  for which they could be fined a hundred pounds, and he gave them ten days  to decide whether they would become his servants or leave the farm.    \"Go away, Auta Gert; you were dreaming, my husband would never talk  such nonsense.  You have been with him from childhood,  long before I ever knew him, and yet you do not know that my husband  is incapable of uttering anything half so wicked?\"    \"He said it was the law, the new law.\"    \"Of course you need some stringent measures against the useless,  sneaking and prowling loafers, but there is no fear that such laws  could apply to Natives like you and Mietje and your children.\"    \"But, Nooi, the Baas told us to leave the farm as the law  did not permit him to ----\"    \"Get you gone, Auta Gert, he was joking.  You must know that the law  did not buy this farm.  The old Baas purchased it from Baas Philander.  I personally helped to add up the number of morgen and to calculate the money,  and there was not a penny piece from any Government.  Go home, Auta Gert,  and leave everything to me, and do not let me hear you saying  Dashfontein is no longer your home.\"    \"Well, Nooi,\" assented the Natives with some relief, \"if you say  it is all right, then it must be so, and we will go back and reap our mealies  in peace, and if a policeman comes round demanding a hundred pounds  we will tell him to arrest us and take us to the Nooi of the farm.  Good-bye, Nooi.\"    \"Good-bye, Auta Gert; good-bye, Auta Jan ----  Poor Anna, my dear little maid,  why did you not tell Nooi this morning that you were worried over this matter.  Really, Anna, I was thinking that you were lovesick.  How did poor old Mietje  take it?  Sadly, did she.  Well, I will speak to the Baas about it.  He had no business to attempt to bring bad luck over us  by disturbing our peaceful Natives with such godless tidings.  Tell your mother that Nooi says it will be all right.\"    A few days later, Hendrik Prins, the farm manager in the employ of Mr. V.,  was due at the native settlement to see the steam sheller at work  and also to receive the landowner's share of the produce.  Instead of Prins,  Mr. V. attended in person.  Each Native regarded this unusual occurrence  as the signal for their impending eviction and thought that day would see  their last transaction with their old master and landlord.    Mr. V. counted the separate bags filled with mealies and Kafir corn  placed in groups around the sheller.  He counted no fewer than 12,300 bags,  and knew that his share would total 6,150, representing about  3,000 Pounds gross.  Could he ever succeed in getting so much,  with so little trouble, if poor whites tilled his lands  instead of these Natives? he thought.  After all, his dear Johanna was right.  This law is blind and must be resisted.  It gives more consideration  to the so-called poor whites (a respectable term for lazy whites),  than to the owners of the ground.  He, there and then, resolved to resist it  and take the consequences.    The grain was all threshed; a number of native girls were busy  sewing up the bags, and the engine-driver ordered his men  to yoke his oxen and pull the machine away.  Mr. V. ordered Auta Gert  to call all the `volk' together as he had something to tell them.  Auta Gert, knowing the determination of his mistress,  did so in confidence that they were about to receive some glad tidings.  But the other folks came forward with a grievous sense of wrong.  The fact that some Natives on the adjoining property  had been turned away three days before and sent homeless about the country,  their places being taken by others, who, tired of roaming about and losing  nearly everything, had come in as serfs did not allay their fears.  Auta Hans was already conjuring up visions of a Johannesburg speculator  literally \"taking\" his Cape shorthorns for a mere bagatelle,  as they did to William Ranco, another evicted squatter from Hoopstad.    Mr. V., the farmer, mounted a handy wagon hard by and commenced to address  the crowd of blacks who gathered around the wagon at the call of Gert.    \"Attention!  Listen,\" he said.  \"You will remember that I was here last month  and explained to you the new law.  Well, I understand that that explanation  created the greatest amount of unrest amongst the Natives in the huts  on my farm.  Personally, I am very sorry that it ever came to that,  but let me tell you that your Nooi, my wife, says it is not right  that the terms under which we have lived in the past should be disturbed.  I agree with her that it is unjust, and that the good Lord,  who has always blessed us, will turn His face from us  if people are unsettled and sent away from the farm in a discontented mood.\"  (Loud and continued applause, during which Mr. V. took out  his pouch of Magaliesburg tobacco and lit his pipe.)  \"The Nooi,\" he continued  after a few puffs, \"says we must not obey this law:  she even says,  if it comes to physical ejectment, or if they take me to prison,  she is prepared to go to Pretoria in person and interview General Botha.\"  (More cheers, during which the Natives dispersed to cart away their mealies  amidst general satisfaction.)         *    *    *    *    * "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#19)"],[1,"there was the  method of a calculating mind. He aimed to kindle a conflagration because  he had icebergs to melt. \"The public shall not be imposed upon,\" he  replied to one of his critics, \"and men and things shall be called by  their right names. I retract nothing, I blot out nothing. My language is  exactly such as suits me; it will displease many, I know; to displease  them is my intention.\" He was philosopher enough to see that he could  reach the national conscience only by exciting the national anger. It  was not popular rage, which he feared but popular apathy. If he could  goad the people to anger on the subject of slavery he would soon be rid  of their apathy. And so week after week he piled every sort of  combustible material, which he was able to collect on board the  _Liberator_ and lighting it all, sent the fiery messenger blazing among  the icebergs of the Union. Slaveholders were robbers, murderers,  oppressors; they were guilty of all the sins of the decalogue, were in a  word the chief of sinners. At the same moment that the reformer denied  their right of property in the slave, he attacked their character also,  held them up in their relation of masters to the reprobation of the  nation and of mankind as monsters of injustice and inhumanity. The tone  which he held toward them, steadily, without shadow of change, was the  tone of a righteous man toward the workers of iniquity. The  indifference, the apathy, the pro-slavery sympathy and prejudice of the  free States rendered the people of the North hardly less culpable. They  were working iniquity with the people of the South. This was the long,  sharp goad, which the young editor thrust in between the bars of the  Union and stirred the guilty sections to quick and savage outbursts of  temper against him and the bitter truths which he preached. Almost  directly the proofs came to him that he was HEARD at the South and at  the North alike. Angry growls reached his ears in the first month of the  publication of the _Liberator_ from some heartless New England editors  in denunciation of his \"violent and intemperate attacks on  slaveholders.\" The _Journal_, published at Louisville, Kentucky, and  edited by George D. Prentice, declared that, \"some of his opinions with  regard to slavery in the United States are no better than lunacy.\" The  _American Spectator_ published at the seat of the National Government,  had hoped that the good sense of the \"late talented and persecuted  junior editor\" of the _Genius_, \"would erelong withdraw him even from  the side of the Abolitionists.\" And from farther South the growl which  the reformer heard was unmistakably ferocious. It was from the State of  South Carolina and the Camden _Journal_, which pronounced the  _Liberator_ \"a scandalous and incendiary budget of sedition.\" These were  the beginning of the chorus of curses, which soon were to sing their  serpent songs about his head. Profane and abusive letters from irate  slaveholders and their Northern sympathisers began to pour into the  sanctum of the editor. Within a few months after the first issue of the  _Liberator_ the whole aspect of the world without had changed toward  him. \"Foes are on my right hand, and on my left,\" he reported to some  friends. \"The tongue of detraction is busy against me. I have no  communion with the world--the world none with me. The timid, the  lukewarm, the base, affect to believe that my brains are disordered, and  my words the ravings of a maniac. Even many of my friends--they who have  grown up with me from my childhood--are transformed into scoffers and  enemies.\" The apathy of the press, and the apathy of the people were  putting forth signs that the long winter of the land was passing away.    To a colored man belongs the high honor of having been the _courier  avant_ of the slavery agitation. This man was David Walker, who lived in  Boston, and who published in 1829 a religio-political discussion of the  status of the negroes of the United States in four articles. The  wretchedness of the blacks in consequence of slavery he depicted in dark  and bitter language. Theodore Parker, many years afterward, said that  the negro was deficient in vengeance, the lowest form of justice.  \"Walker's Appeal\" evinced no deficiency in this respect in its author.  The pamphlet found its way South, and was the cause of no little  commotion among the master-class. It was looked upon as an instigation  to servile insurrection. The \"Appeal\" was proscribed, and a price put  upon the head of the author. Garrison deprecated the sanguinary  character of the book. For he himself was the very reverse of Walker.  Garrison was a full believer in the literal doctrine of non-resistance  as enunciated by Jesus. He abhorred all war, and physical collisions of  every description, as wicked and inhuman. He sang to the slave:      \"Not by the sword shall your deliverance be;    Not by the shedding of your master's blood,    Not by rebellion--or foul treachery,    Upspringing suddenly, like swelling flood;    Revenge and rapine ne'er did bring forth good.    God's _time is best_!--nor will it long delay;    Even now your barren cause begins to bud,    And glorious shall the fruit be!--watch and pray,    For lo! the kindling dawn that ushers in the day.\"      He considered \"Walker's Appeal\" \"a most injudicious publication, yet  warranted by the creed of an independent people.\" He saw in our  Fourth-of-July demonstrations, in our glorification of force as an  instrument for achieving liberty, a constant incentive to the slaves to  go and do likewise. If it was right for the men of 1776 to rise in  rebellion against their mother-country, it surely could not be wrong  were the slaves to revolt against their oppressors, and strike for their  freedom. It certainly did not lie in the mouth of a people, who  apotheosized force, to condemn them. What was sauce for the white man's  goose was sauce for the black man's gander.    The South could not distinguish between this sort of reasoning, and an  express and positive appeal to the slaves to cut the throats of their  masters. The contents of the _Liberator_ were quite as likely to produce  a slave insurrection as was \"Walker's Appeal,\" if the paper was allowed  to circulate freely among the slave population. It was, in fact, more  dangerous to the lives and interests of slaveholders by virtue of the  pictorial representation of the barbarism and abomination of the  peculiar institution, introduced as a feature of the _Liberator_ in its  seventeenth number, in the shape of a slave auction, where the slaves  are chattels, and classed with \"horses and other cattle,\" and where the  tortures of the whipping-post are in vigorous operation. Here was a  message, which every slave, however ignorant and illiterate could read.  His instinct would tell him, wherever he saw the pictured horror, that a  friend, not an enemy, had drawn it, but for what purpose? What was the  secret meaning, which he was to extract from a portrayal of his woes at  once so real and terrible. Was it to be a man, to seize the knife, the  torch, to slay and burn his way to the rights and estate of a man?  Garrison had put no such bloody import into the cut. It was designed not  to appeal to the passions of the slaves, but to the conscience of the  North. But the South did not so read it, was incapable, in fact, of so  reading it. What it saw was a shockingly realistic representation of the  wrongs of the slaves, the immediate and inevitable effect of which upon  the slaves would be to incite them to sedition, to acts of revenge.  Living as the slaveholders were over mines of powder and dynamite, it is  not to be marveled at that the first flash of danger filled them with  apprehension and terror. The awful memories of San Domingo flamed red  and dreadful against the dark background of every Southern plantation  and slave community. In the \"belly\" of the _Liberator's_ picture were  many San Domingos. Extreme fear is the beginning of madness; it is,  indeed, a kind of madness. The South was suddenly plunged into a state  of extreme fear toward which the _Liberator_ and \"Walker's Appeal\" were  hurrying it, by one of those strange accidents or coincidences of  history.    This extraordinary circumstance was the slave insurrection in  Southampton, Virginia, in the month of August, 1831. The leader of the  uprising was the now famous Nat Turner. Brooding over the wrongs of his  race for several years, he conceived that he was the divinely appointed  agent to redress them. He was cast in the mould of those rude heroes,  who spring out of the sides of oppression as isolated trees will  sometimes grow out of clefts in a mountain. With his yearning to deliver  his people, there mingled not a little religious frenzy and  superstition. Getting his command from Heaven to arise against the  masters, he awaited the sign from this same source of the moment for  beginning the work of destruction. It came at last and on the night of  August 21st; he and his confederates made a beginning by massacring  first his own master, Mr. Joseph Travis, and his entire family. Turner's  policy was remorseless enough. It was to spare no member of the white  race, whether man, woman, or child, the very infant at the mother's  breast was doomed to the knife, until he was able to collect such an  assured force as would secure the success of the enterprise. This  purpose was executed with terrible severity and exactness. All that  night the work of extermination went on as the slave leader and his  followers passed like fate from house to house, and plantation to  plantation, leaving a wide swathe of death in their track. Terror filled  the night, terror filled the State, the most abject terror clutched the  bravest hearts. The panic was pitiable, horrible. James McDowell, one of  the leaders of the Old Dominion, gave voice to the awful memories and  sensations of that night,"]]]
