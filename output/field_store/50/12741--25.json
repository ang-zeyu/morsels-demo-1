Nearly every illustration in the works of Egyptologists  brings before us the figure of some deity receiving with an impassive  countenance the prayers and offerings of a worshipper. One would think  that the country had been inhabited for the most part by gods, and  contained just sufficient men and animals to satisfy the requirements of  their worship.    [Illustration: 108.jpg THE GODDESS NAPKIT, STAPIT.1]         1  The goddess Naprit, Napit; bas-relief from the first       chamber of Osiris, on the east side of the great temple of       Denderah. Drawn by Faucher-Gudin.    On penetrating into this mysterious world, we are confronted by an  actual rabble of gods, each one of whom has always possessed but a  limited and almost unconscious existence. They severally represented a  function, a moment in the life of man or of the universe; thus Naprit  was identified with the ripe ear, or the grain of wheat;[**]         **  The word _naprit_ means _grain_, the grain of wheat. The       grain-god is represented in the tomb of Seti I. as a man       wearing two full ears of wheat or barley upon his head. He       is mentioned in the _Hymn to the Nile_ about the same date,       and in two or three other texts of different periods. The       goddess _Naprit_, or _Napit_, to whom reference is here       made, was his duplicate; her head-dress is a sheaf of corn,       as in the illustration.         *** This goddess, whose name expresses and whose form       personifies the brick or stone couch, the child-bed or       -chair, upon which women in labour bowed themselves, is       sometimes subdivided into two or four secondary divinities.       She is mentioned along with Shait, _destiny_, and Raninit,       _suckling_. Her part of fairy godmother at the cradle of the       new-born child is indicated in the passage of the Westcar       Papyrus giving a detailed account of the births of three       kings of the fifth dynasty. She is represented in human       form, and often wears upon her head two long palm-shoots,       curling over at their ends.    Maskhonit appeared by the child's cradle at the very moment of its  birth;[*] and Raninit presided over the naming and the nurture of the  newly born.[*] Neither Raninit, the fairy godmother, nor Maskhonit  exercised over nature as a whole that sovereign authority which we are  accustomed to consider the primary attribute of deity. Every day  of every year was passed by the one in easing the pangs of women in  travail; by the other, in choosing for each baby a name of an auspicious  sound, and one which would afterwards serve to exorcise the influences  of evil fortune. No sooner were their tasks accomplished in one place  than they hastened to another, where approaching birth demanded their  presence and their care. From child-bed to child-bed they passed, and if  they fulfilled the single offices in which they were accounted adepts,  the pious asked nothing more of them. Bands of mysterious cynocephali  haunting the Eastern and the Western mountains concentrated the whole  of their activity on one passing moment of the day. They danced and  chattered in the East for half an hour, to salute the sun at his rising,  even as others in the West hailed him on his entrance into night.[**]         *  Raninit presides over the child's suckling, but she also       gives him his name, and hence, his fortune. She is on the       whole the nursing goddess. Sometimes she is represented as a       human-headed woman, or as lioness-headed, most frequently       with the head of a serpent; she is also the urseus, clothed,       and wearing two long plumes on her head, and a simple urous,       as represented in the illustration on p. 169.         **  This is the subject of a vignette in the _Book of the       Dead_, ch. xvi., where the cynocephali are placed in echelon       upon the slopes of the hill on the horizon, right and left       of the radiant solar disk, to which they offer worship by       gesticulations.    It was the duty of certain genii to open gates in Hades, or to keep the  paths daily traversed by the sun.[*] These genii were always at their  posts, never free to leave them, and possessed no other faculty than  that of punctually fulfilling their appointed offices. Their existence,  generally unperceived, was suddenly revealed at the very moment when the  specific acts of their lives were on the point of accomplishment. These  being completed, the divinities fell back into their state of inertia,  and were, so to speak, reabsorbed by their functions until the next  occasion.[***]         *  Maspero, _Etudes de Mythologie et d'Archeologie       Egyptiennes_, vol. ii. pp. 34, 35.         ***  The Egyptians employed a still more forcible expression       than our word \"absorption\" to express this idea. It was said       of objects wherein these genii concealed themselves, and       whence they issued in order to re-enter them immediately,       that these forms _ate_ them, or that they _ate_ their own       forms.    [Illustration: 110.jpg SOME FABULOUS BEASTS OF THE EGYPTIAN DESERT. 2]         2  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin from Champollion's copies, made       from the tombs of Beni-Hassan. To the right is the _sha_,       one of the animals of Sit, and an exact image of the god       with his stiff and arrow-like tail. Next comes the _safir_,       the griffin; and, lastly, we have the serpent-headed _saza_.    Scarcely visible even by glimpses, they were not easily depicted; their  real forms being often unknown, these were approximately conjectured  from their occupations. The character and costume of an archer, or of a  spear-man, were ascribed to such as roamed through Hades, to pierce the  dead with arrows or with javelins. Those who prowled around souls to cut  their throats and hack them to pieces were represented as women armed  with knives, carvers--_donit_--or else as lacerators--_nokit_. Some  appeared in human form; others as animals--bulls or lions, rams or  monkeys, serpents, fish, ibises, hawks; others dwelt in inanimate  things, such as trees,[*] sistrums, stakes stuck in the ground;[**] and  lastly, many betrayed a mixed origin in their combinations of human and  animal forms. These latter would be regarded by us as monsters; to the  Egyptians, they were beings, rarer perhaps than the rest, but not the  less real, and their like might be encountered in the neighbourhood of  Egypt.[***]         *  Thus, the sycamores planted on the edge of the desert       were supposed to be inhabited by Hathor, Nuit, Selkit, Nit,       or some other goddess. In vignettes representing the       deceased as stopping before one of these trees and receiving       water and loaves of bread, the bust of the goddess generally       appears from amid her sheltering foliage. But occasionally,       as on the sarcophagus of Petosiris, the transformation is       complete, and the trunk from which the branches spread is       the actual body of the god or goddess. Finally, the whole       body is often hidden, and only the arm of the goddess to be       seen emerging from the midst of the tree, with an       overflowing libation vase in her hand.         **  The trunk of a tree, disbranched, and then set up in the       ground, seems to me the origin of the Osirian emblem called       _tat_ or _didu_. The symbol was afterwards so       conventionalized as to represent four columns seen in       perspective, one capital overtopping another; it thus became       the image of the four pillars which uphold the world.         ***  The belief in the real existence of fantastic animals       was first noted by Maspero, _Etudes de Mythologie et       d'Archeologie Egyptiennes_, vol. i. pp. 117, 118, 132, and       vol.  ii.  p.   213.    Until then,  scholars only       recognized the sphinx, and other Egyptian monsters, as       allegorical combinations by which the priesthood claimed to       give visible expression in one and the same being to       physical or moral qualities belonging to several different       beings.

I have  not discovered any defect in the way in which it was put on; it  appears to be perfect. The pitch may be too low, and the rain may be  driven through by the wind on this account. Is there any wash, paint,  or cement that might be used for the purpose of remedying this defect?  A. There is an india rubber paint which is used to make leaky roofs  tight, but we have not learned of its being applied to slate roofs.    (2) C.C.B. says: I am making a small steam engine. The cylinder has,  inside diameter, about 1 inch with 21/2 inches stroke. What would be the  most suitable material and dimensions for the boiler? A. Make one 10  or 12 inches in diameter and 18 inches high, of 1/8 inch iron. You can  carry 60 lbs. steam pressure.    (3) M.C. says: I have had charge of some greenhouses that were erected  about four years ago; they are thoroughly heated, and all the pipes  have a thick coat of black paint. The houses never gave any  satisfaction, no matter how healthy the plants were in the fall. Soon  after the fires were lighted both leaves and flowers began to drop,  and some plants died. My predecessors attributed it to gas getting  into the houses. Upon inquiry I found no gas was there except when the  pipes were hot, and that the hotter they were the worse it was. In my  opinion, the cause of the trouble was a strong smell of paint from the  pipes. Since then I only keep heat enough to save the plants from  freezing. A. From your statement there is no doubt that the paint used  on the pipes was an imperfectly purified coal tar. Such tar contains a  great number of hydrocarbons--naphtha, naphthalen, anthracen, phenol,  several organic alkaloids, hydrosulphuric and hydrocyanic acids, etc.,  all of which are more or less volatile at the temperature to which  they must have been subjected. These exhalations have proved fatal to  plant life when in sufficient quantity. We do not know of a better  remedy than that of removing the cause. Painting the pipes with a  strong solution of washing soda and lime would, in a measure, prevent  the escape of the most objectionable constituents into the air, by  forming with them compounds non-volatile at any temperature to which  they are likely to be subjected in contact with the pipes; but the  former would be the surest plan.
