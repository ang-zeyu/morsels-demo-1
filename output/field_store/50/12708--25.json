Its publication       resulted in the detention of the Cardinal by the Germans in       his palace and a consequent protest by the Pope and throughout       the whole Roman Catholic world.         The first reports of the arrest of the Cardinal were denied by       the German authorities. Subsequently an official report made       to the Pope stated that 15,000 copies of the pastoral letter       were seized in Malines and destroyed, the printer being fined;       that the Cardinal was detained in his palace during all Jan.       4; that he was prevented by German officers on Jan. 3 from       presiding at a religious ceremony; that they subjected him to       interrogations and demanded of him a retraction, which he       refused to make. The English reprint of the Cardinal's letter       is copyrighted by Burns & Oates, Ltd., 28 Orchard Street,       London. THE NEW YORK TIMES CURRENT HISTORY reproduces it by       permission.      My Very Dear Brethren: I cannot tell you how instant and how present  thought of you has been to me throughout the months of suffering and of  mourning through which we have passed. I had to leave you abruptly on  the 20th of August in order to fulfill my last duty toward the beloved  and venerated Pope whom we have lost, and in order to discharge an  obligation of the conscience from which I could not dispense myself, in  the election of the successor of Pius X., the Pontiff who now directs  the Church under the title, full of promise and of hope, of Benedict XV.    It was in Rome itself that I received the tidings--stroke after  stroke--of the partial destruction of the Cathedral Church of Louvain,  next of the burning of the library and of the scientific installations  of our great university and of the devastation of the city, and next of  the wholesale shooting of citizens, and tortures inflicted upon women  and children and upon unarmed and undefended men.    And, while I was still under the shock of these calamities, the  telegraph brought us news of the bombardment of our beautiful  metropolitan church, of the Church of Notre Dame au dela la Dyle, of the  episcopal palace, and of a great part of our dear City of Malines.    Afar from my diocese, without means of communication with you, I was  compelled to lock my grief within my own afflicted heart and to carry  it, with the thought of you, which never left me, to the foot of the  Crucifix.    I craved courage and light, and sought them in such thoughts as these: A  disaster has visited the world, and our beloved little Belgium, a nation  so faithful in the great mass of her population to God, so upright in  her patriotism, so noble in her King and Government, is the first  sufferer. She bleeds; her sons are stricken down within her fortresses  and upon her fields, in defense of her rights and of her territory.    Soon there will not be one Belgian family not in mourning. Why all this  sorrow, my God? Lord, Lord, hast Thou forsaken us? Then I looked upon  the Crucifix. I looked upon Jesus, most gentle and humble Lamb of God,  crushed, clothed in His blood as in a garment, and I thought I heard  from His own mouth the words which the psalmist uttered in His name: \"O  God, my God, look upon me; why hast Thou forsaken me? O my God, I shall  cry, and Thou wilt not hear.\"    And forthwith the murmur died upon my lips, and I remembered what our  Divine Saviour said in His gospel: \"The disciple is not above the  master, nor the servant above his lord.\" The Christian is the servant of  a God who became man in order to suffer and to die.    To rebel against pain, to revolt against Providence because it permits  grief and bereavement, is to forget whence we came, the school in which  we have been taught, the example that each of us carries graven in the  name of a Christian, which each of us honors at his hearth, contemplates  at the altar of his prayers, and of which he desires that his tomb, the  place of his last sleep, shall bear the sign.    My dearest brethren, I shall return by and by to the providential law of  suffering, but you will agree that since it has pleased a God-made man  who was holy, innocent, without stain, to suffer and to die for us who  are sinners, who are guilty, who are perhaps criminals, it ill becomes  us to complain whatever we may be called upon to endure. The truth is  that no disaster on earth, striking creatures only, is comparable with  that which our sins provoked and whereof God Himself chose to be the  blameless victim.    Having recalled to mind this fundamental truth, I find it easier to  summon you to face what has befallen us and to speak to you simply and  directly of what is your duty and of what may be your hope. That duty I  shall express in two words--patriotism and endurance.    My dearest brethren, I desire to utter in your name and my own the  gratitude of those whose age, vocation, and social conditions cause them  to benefit by the heroism of others without bearing in it any active  part.    When, immediately on my return from Rome, I went to Havre to greet our  Belgian, French, and English wounded; when, later, at Malines, at  Louvain, at Antwerp, it was given to me to take the hands of those brave  men who carried a bullet in their flesh, a wound on their forehead,  because they had marched to the attack of the enemy or borne the shock  of his onslaught, it was a word of gratitude to them that rose to my  lips. \"O valiant friends,\" I said, \"it was for us, it was for each one  of us, it was for me, that you risked your lives and are now in pain. I  am moved to tell you of my respect, of my thankfulness, to assure you  that the whole nation knows how much she is in debt to you.\"    For in truth our soldiers are our saviors.    A first time, at Liege, they saved France; a second time, in Flanders,  they arrested the advance of the enemy upon Calais. France and England  know it; and Belgium stands before them both, and before the entire  world, as a nation of heroes.    Never before in my whole life did I feel so proud to be a Belgian as  when, on the platforms of French stations, and halting a while in Paris,  and visiting London, I was witness of the enthusiastic admiration our  allies feel for the heroism of our army. Our King is, in the esteem of  all, at the very summit of the moral scale. He is doubtless the only man  who does not recognize that fact, as, simple as the simplest of his  soldiers, he stands in the trenches and puts new courage, by the  serenity of his face, into the hearts of those of whom he requires that  they shall not doubt of their country. The foremost duty of every  Belgian citizen at this hour is gratitude to the army.    If any man had rescued you from shipwreck or from a fire, you would  assuredly hold yourselves bound to him by a debt of everlasting  thankfulness. But it is not one man, it is 250,000 men who fought, who  suffered, who fell for you so that you might be free, so that Belgium  might keep her independence, her dynasty, her patriotic unity; so that  after the vicissitudes of battle she might rise nobler, purer, more  erect, and more glorious than before.    Pray daily, my brethren, for these 250,000 and for their leaders to  victory; pray for our brothers in arms; pray for the fallen; pray for  those who are still engaged; pray for the recruits who are making ready  for the fight to come.    In your name I send them the greeting of our fraternal sympathy and our  assurance that not only do we pray for the success of their arms and for  the eternal welfare of their souls, but that we also accept for their  sake all the distress, whether physical or moral, that falls to our own  share in the oppression that hourly besets us, and all that the future  may have in store for us, in humiliation for a time, in anxiety, and in  sorrow. In the day of final victory we shall all be in honor; it is just  that today we should all be in grief.    To judge by certain rumors that have reached me, I gather that from  districts that have had least to suffer some bitter words have arisen  toward our God, words which, if spoken with cold calculation, would not  be far from blasphemous.    Oh, all too easily do I understand how natural instinct rebels against  the evils that have fallen upon Catholic Belgium. The spontaneous  thought of mankind is ever that virtue should have its instantaneous  crown and injustice its immediate retribution.    But the ways of God are not our ways, the Scripture tells us. Providence  gives free course, for a time measured by Divine wisdom, to human  passions and the conflict of desires. God, being eternal, is patient.  The last word is the word of mercy, and it belongs to those who believe  in love. \"Why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?  _Quare tristis es anima, et quare conturbas me?_\" Hope in God. Bless Him  always. Is He not thy Saviour and thy God? _Spera in Deo quoniam adhuc  confitebor illi, salutare vultus mei et Deus meus._    When holy Job, whom God presented as an example of constancy to the  generations to come, had been stricken, blow upon blow, by Satan, with  the loss of his children, of his goods, of his health, his enemies  approached him with provocations to discouragement; his wife urged upon  him a blasphemy and a curse. \"Dost thou still continue in thy  simplicity? Curse God, and die.\" But the man of God was unshaken in his  confidence. \"And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the  foolish women: if we have received good things at the hand of God, why  should we not receive evil? _Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit; sicut  Domino placuit ita factum est. Sit nomen Domini benedictum._\" And  experience proved that saintly one to be right. It pleased the Lord to  recompense, even here below, His faithful servant. \"The Lord gave Job  twice as much as he had before. And for his sake God pardoned his  friends.\"    Better than any"]]]
