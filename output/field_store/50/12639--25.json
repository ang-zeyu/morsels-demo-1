Hence the  firmer ground of Psychology is not the consciousness of inward feelings  but the observation of external actions, being the actions not only of  ourselves, but of the innumerable persons whom we come across in life.    b. The error of supposing partial or occasional explanation of  mental phenomena to be the only or complete ones. For example, we are  disinclined to admit of the spontaneity or discontinuity of the mind--it  seems to us like an effect without a cause, and therefore we suppose the  train of our thoughts to be always called up by association. Yet it is  probable, or indeed certain, that of many mental phenomena there are no  mental antecedents, but only bodily ones.    c. The false influence of language. We are apt to suppose that when  there are two or more words describing faculties or processes of the  mind, there are real differences corresponding to them. But this is not  the case. Nor can we determine how far they do or do not exist, or  by what degree or kind of difference they are distinguished. The same  remark may be made about figures of speech. They fill up the vacancy of  knowledge; they are to the mind what too much colour is to the eye; but  the truth is rather concealed than revealed by them.    d. The uncertain meaning of terms, such as Consciousness, Conscience,  Will, Law, Knowledge, Internal and External Sense; these, in the  language of Plato, 'we shamelessly use, without ever having taken the  pains to analyze them.'    e. A science such as Psychology is not merely an hypothesis, but  an hypothesis which, unlike the hypotheses of Physics, can never be  verified. It rests only on the general impressions of mankind, and there  is little or no hope of adding in any considerable degree to our stock  of mental facts.    f. The parallelism of the Physical Sciences, which leads us to analyze  the mind on the analogy of the body, and so to reduce mental operations  to the level of bodily ones, or to confound one with the other.    g. That the progress of Physiology may throw a new light on Psychology  is a dream in which scientific men are always tempted to indulge. But  however certain we may be of the connexion between mind and body, the  explanation of the one by the other is a hidden place of nature which  has hitherto been investigated with little or no success.    h. The impossibility of distinguishing between mind and body. Neither  in thought nor in experience can we separate them. They seem to act  together; yet we feel that we are sometimes under the dominion of the  one, sometimes of the other, and sometimes, both in the common use of  language and in fact, they transform themselves, the one into the good  principle, the other into the evil principle; and then again the 'I'  comes in and mediates between them. It is also difficult to distinguish  outward facts from the ideas of them in the mind, or to separate the  external stimulus to a sensation from the activity of the organ, or this  from the invisible agencies by which it reaches the mind, or any process  of sense from its mental antecedent, or any mental energy from its  nervous expression.    i. The fact that mental divisions tend to run into one another, and that  in speaking of the mind we cannot always distinguish differences of kind  from differences of degree; nor have we any measure of the strength and  intensity of our ideas or feelings.    j. Although heredity has been always known to the ancients as well as  ourselves to exercise a considerable influence on human character, yet  we are unable to calculate what proportion this birth-influence bears to  nurture and education. But this is the real question. We cannot pursue  the mind into embryology: we can only trace how, after birth, it begins  to grow. But how much is due to the soil, how much to the original  latent seed, it is impossible to distinguish. And because we are certain  that heredity exercises a considerable, but undefined influence, we must  not increase the wonder by exaggerating it.    k. The love of system is always tending to prevail over the historical  investigation of the mind, which is our chief means of knowing it. It  equally tends to hinder the other great source of our knowledge of the  mind, the observation of its workings and processes which we can make  for ourselves.    l. The mind, when studied through the individual, is apt to be  isolated--this is due to the very form of the enquiry; whereas, in  truth, it is indistinguishable from circumstances, the very language  which it uses being the result of the instincts of long-forgotten  generations, and every word which a man utters being the answer to some  other word spoken or suggested by somebody else.    III. The tendency of the preceding remarks has been to show that  Psychology is necessarily a fragment, and is not and cannot be a  connected system. We cannot define or limit the mind, but we can  describe it. We can collect information about it; we can enumerate the  principal subjects which are included in the study of it. Thus we are  able to rehabilitate Psychology to some extent, not as a branch of  science, but as a collection of facts bearing on human life, as a  part of the history of philosophy, as an aspect of Metaphysic. It is a  fragment of a science only, which in all probability can never make any  great progress or attain to much clearness or exactness. It is however  a kind of knowledge which has a great interest for us and is always  present to us, and of which we carry about the materials in our own  bosoms. We can observe our minds and we can experiment upon them, and  the knowledge thus acquired is not easily forgotten, and is a help to us  in study as well as in conduct.    The principal subjects of Psychology may be summed up as follows:--    a. The relation of man to the world around him,--in what sense and  within what limits can he withdraw from its laws or assert himself  against them (Freedom and Necessity), and what is that which we suppose  to be thus independent and which we call ourselves? How does the inward  differ from the outward and what is the relation between them, and where  do we draw the line by which we separate mind from matter, the soul  from the body? Is the mind active or passive, or partly both? Are its  movements identical with those of the body, or only preconcerted and  coincident with them, or is one simply an aspect of the other?    b. What are we to think of time and space? Time seems to have a nearer  connexion with the mind, space with the body; yet time, as well as  space, is necessary to our idea of either. We see also that they have  an analogy with one another, and that in Mathematics they often  interpenetrate. Space or place has been said by Kant to be the form of  the outward, time of the inward sense. He regards them as parts or  forms of the mind. But this is an unfortunate and inexpressive way of  describing their relation to us. For of all the phenomena present to the  human mind they seem to have most the character of objective existence.  There is no use in asking what is beyond or behind them; we cannot get  rid of them. And to throw the laws of external nature which to us are  the type of the immutable into the subjective side of the antithesis  seems to be equally inappropriate.    c. When in imagination we enter into the closet of the mind and withdraw  ourselves from the external world, we seem to find there more or less  distinct processes which may be described by the words, 'I perceive,' 'I  feel,' 'I think,' 'I want,' 'I wish,' 'I like,' 'I dislike,' 'I fear,'  'I know,' 'I remember,' 'I imagine,' 'I dream,' 'I act,' 'I endeavour,'  'I hope.' These processes would seem to have the same notions attached  to them in the minds of all educated persons. They are distinguished  from one another in thought, but they intermingle. It is possible to  reflect upon them or to become conscious of them in a greater or less  degree, or with a greater or less continuity or attention, and thus  arise the intermittent phenomena of consciousness or self-consciousness.  The use of all of them is possible to us at all times; and therefore  in any operation of the mind the whole are latent. But we are able to  characterise them sufficiently by that part of the complex action which  is the most prominent. We have no difficulty in distinguishing an act  of sight or an act of will from an act of thought, although thought is  present in both of them. Hence the conception of different faculties or  different virtues is precarious, because each of them is passing into  the other, and they are all one in the mind itself; they appear and  reappear, and may all be regarded as the ever-varying phases or aspects  or differences of the same mind or person.    d. Nearest the sense in the scale of the intellectual faculties  is memory, which is a mode rather than a faculty of the mind, and  accompanies all mental operations. There are two principal kinds of it,  recollection and recognition,--recollection in which forgotten things  are recalled or return to the mind, recognition in which the mind finds  itself again among things once familiar. The simplest way in which we  can represent the former to ourselves is by shutting our eyes and trying  to recall in what we term the mind's eye the picture of the  surrounding scene, or by laying down the book which we are reading and  recapitulating what we can remember of it. But many times more powerful  than recollection is recognition, perhaps because it is more assisted by  association. We have known and forgotten, and after a long interval the  thing which we have seen once is seen again by us, but with a different  feeling, and comes back to us, not as new knowledge, but as a thing to  which we ourselves impart a notion already present to us; in Plato's  words, we set the stamp upon the wax. Every one is aware of the  difference between the first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#19)"],[1,", and the steadfast goodly Odysseus shuddered,  and uttering his voice spake to her winged words: 'Herein,  goddess, thou hast plainly some other thought, and in no  wise my furtherance, for that thou biddest me to cross in a  raft the great gulf of the sea so dread and difficult,  which not even the swift gallant ships pass over rejoicing  in the breeze of Zeus. Nor would I go aboard a raft to  displeasure thee, unless thou wilt deign, O goddess, to  swear a great oath not to plan any hidden guile to mine own  hurt.'    So spake he, and Calypso, the fair goddess, smiled and  caressed him with her hand, and spake and hailed him:    'Knavish thou art, and no weakling {*} in wit, thou that  hast conceived and spoken such a word. Let earth be now  witness hereto, and the wide heaven above, and that falling  water of the Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible  to the blessed gods, that I will not plan any hidden guile  to thine own hurt. Nay, but my thoughts are such, and such  will be my counsel, as I would devise for myself, if ever  so sore a need came over me. For I too have a righteous  mind, and my heart within me is not of iron, but pitiful  even as thine.'    {* [Greek], from root [Greek], 'ill-grown,' i. e. a  weakling, in the literal sense as B. xi.249, xiv.212, or  metaphorical, as here and viii. 177.}    Therewith the fair goddess led the way quickly, and he  followed hard in the steps of the goddess. And they reached  the hollow cave, the goddess and the man; so he sat him  down upon the chair whence Hermes had arisen, and the nymph  placed by him all manner of food to eat and drink, such as  is meat for men. As for her she sat over against divine  Odysseus, and the handmaids placed by her ambrosia and  nectar. So they put forth their hands upon the good cheer  set before them. But after they had taken their fill of  meat and drink, Calypso, the fair goddess, spake first and  said:    'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many  devices, so it is indeed thy wish to get thee home to thine  own dear country even in this hour? Good fortune go with  thee even so! Yet didst thou know in thine heart what a  measure of suffering thou art ordained to fulfil, or ever  thou reach thine own country, here, even here, thou wouldst  abide with me and keep this house, and wouldst never taste  of death, though thou longest to see thy wife, for whom  thou hast ever a desire day by day. Not in sooth that I  avow me to be less noble than she in form or fashion, for  it is in no wise meet that mortal women should match them  with immortals, in shape and comeliness.'    And Odysseus of many counsels answered, and spake unto her:  'Be not wroth with me hereat, goddess and queen. Myself I  know it well, how wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than  thou, in comeliness and stature. But she is mortal and thou  knowest not age nor death. Yet even so, I wish and long day  by day to fare homeward and see the day of my returning.  Yea, and if some god shall wreck me in the wine-dark deep,  even so I will endure, with a heart within me patient of  affliction. For already have I suffered full much, and much  have I toiled in perils of waves and war; let this be added  to the tale of those.'    So spake he, and the sun sank and darkness came on. Then  they twain went into the chamber of the hollow rock, and  had their delight of love, abiding each by other.    So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, anon  Odysseus put on him a mantle and doublet, and the nymph  clad her in a great shining robe, light of woof and  gracious, and about her waist she cast a fair golden  girdle, and a veil withal upon her head. Then she  considered of the sending of Odysseus, the great-hearted.  She gave him a great axe, fitted to his grasp, an axe of  bronze double-edged, and with a goodly handle of olive wood  fastened well. Next she gave him a polished adze, and she  led the way to the border of the isle where tall trees  grew, alder and poplar, and pine that reacheth unto heaven,  seasoned long since and sere, that might lightly float for  him. Now after she had shown him where the tall trees grew,  Calypso, the fair goddess, departed homeward. And he set to  cutting timber, and his work went busily. Twenty trees in  all he felled, and then trimmed them with the axe of  bronze, and deftly smoothed them, and over them made  straight the line. Meanwhile Calypso, the fair goddess,  brought him augers, so he bored each piece and jointed them  together, and then made all fast with trenails and dowels.  Wide as is the floor of a broad ship of burden, which some  man well skilled in carpentry may trace him out, of such  beam did Odysseus fashion his broad raft. And thereat he  wrought, and set up the deckings, fitting them to the  close-set uprights, and finished them off with long  gunwales, and there he set a mast, and a yard-arm fitted  thereto, and moreover he made him a rudder to guide the  craft. And he fenced it with wattled osier withies from  stem to stern, to be a bulwark against the wave, and piled  up wood to back them. Meanwhile Calypso, the fair goddess,  brought him web of cloth to make him sails; and these too  he fashioned very skilfully. And he made fast therein  braces and halyards and sheets, and at last he pushed the  raft with levers down to the fair salt sea.    It was the fourth day when he had accomplished all. And,  lo, on the fifth, the fair Calypso sent him on his way from  the island, when she had bathed him and clad him in  fragrant attire. Moreover, the goddess placed on board the  ship two skins, one of dark wine, and another, a great one,  of water, and corn too in a wallet, and she set therein a  store of dainties to his heart's desire, and sent forth a  warm and gentle wind to blow. And goodly Odysseus rejoiced  as he set his sails to the breeze. So he sate and cunningly  guided the craft with the helm, nor did sleep fall upon his  eyelids, as he viewed the Pleiads and Bootes, that setteth  late, and the Bear, which they likewise call the Wain,  which turneth ever in one place, and keepeth watch upon  Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean. This  star, Calypso, the fair goddess, bade him to keep ever on  the left as he traversed the deep. Ten days and seven he  sailed traversing the deep, and on the eighteenth day  appeared the shadowy hills of the land of the Phaeacians,  at the point where it lay nearest to him; and it showed  like a shield in the misty deep.    Now the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the  Ethiopians espied him afar off from the mountains of the  Solymi: even thence he saw Odysseus as he sailed over the  deep; and he was mightily angered in spirit, and shaking  his head he communed with his own heart. 'Lo now, it must  be that the gods at the last have changed their purpose  concerning Odysseus, while I was away among the Ethiopians.  And now he is nigh to the Phaeacian land, where it is  ordained that he escape the great issues of the woe which  hath come upon him. But, methinks, that even yet I will  drive him far enough in the path of suffering.'    With that he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of  the deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused  all storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds  the land and sea: and down sped night from heaven. The East  Wind and the South Wind clashed, and the stormy West, and  the North, that is born in the bright air, rolling onward a  great wave. Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and  his heart melted, and heavily he spake to his own great  spirit:    'Oh, wretched man that I am! what is to befal me at the  last? I fear that indeed the goddess spake all things  truly, who said that I should fill up the measure of sorrow  on the deep, or ever I came to mine own country; and lo,  all these things have an end. In such wise doth Zeus crown  the wide heaven with clouds, and hath troubled the deep,  and the blasts rush on of all the winds; yea, now is utter  doom assured me. Thrice blessed those Danaans, yea, four  times blessed, who perished on a time in wide Troy-land,  doing a pleasure to the sons of Atreus! Would to God that I  too had died, and met my fate on that day when the press of  Trojans cast their bronze-shod spears upon me, fighting for  the body of the son of Peleus! So should I have gotten my  dues of burial, and the Achaeans would have spread my fame;  but now it is my fate to be overtaken by a pitiful death.'    Even as he spake, the great wave smote down upon him,  driving on in terrible wise, that the raft reeled again.  And far therefrom he fell, and lost the helm from his hand;  and the fierce blast of the jostling winds came and brake  his mast in the midst, and sail and yard-arm fell afar into  the deep. Long time the water kept him under, nor could he  speedily rise from beneath the rush of the mighty wave:  for the garments hung heavy which fair Calypso gave him.  But late and at length he came up, and spat forth from his  mouth the bitter salt water, which ran down in streams from  his head. Yet even so forgat he not his raft, for all his  wretched plight, but made a spring after it in the waves,  and clutched it to him, and sat in the midst thereof,  avoiding the issues of death; and the great wave swept it  hither and thither along the stream. And as the North Wind  in the harvest tide sweeps the thistle-down along the  plain, and close the tufts cling each to other, even so the  winds bare the raft hither and thither along the main. Now  the South would toss it to the North to carry, and now  again the East would yield it to the West to chase.    But the daughter of Cadmus marked him, Ino of the fair  ankles, Leucothea, who in time past was a maiden of mortal  speech, but now in the depths of the salt sea she had  gotten her share of worship from the gods. She took pity on  Odysseus in his wandering and travail, and she rose, like a  sea-gul"]]]
