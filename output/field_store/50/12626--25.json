In this Thou hadst no other  purpose except to try them who have manifested Thy most excellent titles  unto all who are in heaven and on earth. He it was Whom Thou hast  commanded to establish His covenant with all created things.    And when Thy promise came to pass and the set time was fulfilled, He Who  is the Possessor of all Names and Attributes was made manifest unto men.  Thereupon all that were in the heavens and all that were on the earth were  terror-stricken save those whom Thou didst keep under Thy protection and  preserve within the shelter of Thy power and gracious providence. There  befell Him, at the hands of such of Thy creatures as have transgressed  against Thee, that which the tongue of no one of Thy servants can recount.    Look down, then, upon Him, O my God, with the eye of Thy tender mercy, and  send down upon Him and upon those that love Him all the good Thou didst  ordain in the heaven of Thy will and the Tablet of Thy decree. Aid them,  then, with Thy succor, for Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most  Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling.            LXXIX: \"ALL GLORY BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! I BEAR...\"      All glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I bear witness for Thee to that  whereto Thou Thyself didst bear witness for Thine own Self, ere the day  Thou hadst created the creation or made mention thereof, that Thou art  God, and that there is none other God beside Thee. From eternity Thou  hast, in Thy transcendent oneness, been immeasurably exalted above Thy  servants' conception of Thy unity, and wilt to eternity remain, in Thine  unapproachable singleness, far above the praise of Thy creatures. No words  that any one beside Thee may utter can ever beseem Thee, and no man's  description except Thine own description can befit Thy nature. All who  adore Thy unity have been sore perplexed to fathom the mystery of Thy  oneness, and all have confessed their powerlessness to attain unto the  comprehension of Thine essence and to scale the pinnacle of Thy knowledge.  The mighty have all acknowledged their weakness, and the learned  recognized their ignorance. They that are possessed of influence are as  nothing when compared with the revelations of Thy stupendous sovereignty,  and they who are exalted sink into oblivion when brought before the  manifestations of Thy great glory. The radiance of the brightest  luminaries is eclipsed by the effulgent splendors of Thy face, and the  tongues of the most eloquent of speakers falter under the unrestrained  effusions of Thy holy utterance, and the foundations of the mightiest  structures tremble before the onrushing force of Thy compelling power.    Who is there, O my God, that can be deemed worthy to be remembered when  Thou art remembered, and where is he to be found who can be regarded as  capable of hinting at Thy nature or worthy of mention in the court of Thy  transcendent oneness? From everlasting Thou hast been alone with no one  else beside Thee, and to everlasting Thou wilt continue to be one and the  same. No God is there beside Thee, the God of power, of glory and wisdom.    Glorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thine  exalted and supreme Remembrance, Whom Thou hast sent down unto all Thy  creatures and invested with Thy name, the All-Glorious, Whose will Thou  hast ordained to be Thine own will, Whose self Thou hast decreed to be the  revealer of Thine own Self, and His essence the Day-Spring of Thy wisdom,  and His heart the treasury of Thine inspiration, and His breast the  dawning-place of Thy most excellent attributes and most exalted titles,  and His tongue the fountain-head of the waters of Thy praise and the  well-spring of the soft-flowing streams of Thy wisdom, to send down upon  us that which will enable us to dispense with all else except Thee, and  will cause us to direct our steps towards the sanctuary of Thy pleasure  and to aspire after the things Thou didst ordain for us according to Thine  irrevocable decree. Empower us, then, O my God, to forsake ourselves and  cleave steadfastly to Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self, the Most  Exalted, the Most High. Supply us also with that which is best for us, and  write us down with such of Thy servants as have repudiated the Idol (Mirza  Yahya), and firmly believed in Thee, and been so established on the throne  of certitude that the whisperings of the Evil One have been powerless to  hinder them from turning their faces towards Thy name, the All-Merciful.    Powerful art Thou to do what Thou pleasest and to ordain what Thou  willest. No God is there but Thee, the All-Possessing, the All-Highest,  the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.            LXXX: \"O THOU WHOSE REMEMBRANCE IS THE DELIGHT OF THE...\"      O Thou Whose remembrance is the delight of the souls of all them that  yearn after Thee, Whose name is the exultation of the hearts of all who  are wholly devoted to Thy will, Whose praise is cherished by such as have  drawn nigh unto Thy court, Whose face is the ardent desire of all them  that have recognized Thy truth, Whose trial is the healer of the  sicknesses of them who have embraced Thy Cause, Whose calamity is the  highest aspiration of such as are rid of all attachment to any one but  Thyself!    Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou, in Whose hands is the empire  of whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth, Thou, Who  through but one word of Thy mouth, caused all things to expire and  dissolve asunder, and Who, by yet another word, caused whatever had been  separated to be combined and reunited! Magnified be Thy name, O Thou Who  hast power over all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth,  Whose dominion embraceth whatsoever is in the heaven of Thy Revelation and  the kingdom of Thy creation. None can equal Thee in Thy created realms;  none can compare with Thee in the universe Thou hast fashioned. The mind  of no one hath comprehended Thee, and the aspiration of no soul hath  reached Thee. I swear by Thy might! Were any one to soar, on whatever  wings, as long as Thine own Being endureth, throughout the immensity of  Thy knowledge, he would still be powerless to transgress the bounds which  the contingent world hath set for him. How can, then, such a man aspire to  wing his flight into the atmosphere of Thy most exalted presence?    He, indeed, is endued with understanding who acknowledgeth his  powerlessness and confesseth his sinfulness, for should any created thing  lay claim to any existence, when confronted with the infinite wonders of  Thy Revelation, so blasphemous a pretension would be more heinous than any  other crime in all the domains of Thine invention and creation. Who is  there, O my Lord, that, when Thou revealest the first glimmerings of the  signs of Thy transcendent sovereignty and might, hath the power to claim  for himself any existence whatever? Existence itself is as nothing when  brought face to face with the mighty and manifold wonders of Thine  incomparable Self.    Far, immeasurably far, art Thou exalted above all things, O Thou Who art  the King of Kings! I entreat Thee by Thy Self and by Them Who are the  Manifestations of Thy Cause and the Day-Springs of Thine authority to  write down for us that which Thou hast written down for Thy chosen ones.  Withhold not from us that which Thou didst ordain for Thy loved ones, who,  as soon as Thy call reached them, hastened unto Thee, and when the  splendors of the light of Thy countenance were shed upon them, instantly  prostrated themselves in adoration before Thy face.    We are Thy servants, O my Lord, and in the grasp of Thy power. If Thou  chastisest us with the chastisement inflicted upon the former and the  latter generations, Thy verdict would be assuredly just and Thine act  praiseworthy. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. None other God  is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Help in Peril,  the Self-Subsisting.            LXXXI: \"UNTO THEE BE PRAISE, O THOU WHO INCLINEST THINE...\"      Unto Thee be praise, O Thou Who inclinest Thine ear to the sighing of them  that have rid themselves of all attachment to any one but Thee, and Who  hearest the voice of the lamentation of those who are wholly devoted to  Thy Self! Thou beholdest all that hath befallen them at the hands of such  of Thy creatures as have transgressed and rebelled against Thee. Thy might  beareth me witness, O Thou Who art the King of the realms of justice and  the Ruler of the cities of mercy! The tribulations they have been made to  suffer are such as no pen, in the entire creation, can reckon. Should any  one attempt to make mention of them, he would find himself powerless to  describe them.    As these tribulations, however, were sustained in Thy path and for love of  Thee, they who were afflicted by them render thanks, under all conditions,  unto Thee, and say: \"O Thou Who art the Delight of our hearts and the  Object of our adoration! Were the clouds of Thy decree to rain down upon  us the darts of affliction, we would, in our love for Thee, refuse to be  impatient. We would yield Thee praise and thanksgiving, for we have  recognized and are persuaded that Thou hast ordained only that which will  be best for us. If our bodies be, at times, weighed down by our troubles,  yet our souls rejoice with exceeding gladness. We swear by Thy might, O  Thou Who art the Desire of our hearts and the Exultation of our souls!  Every trouble that toucheth us in our love for Thee is an evidence of Thy  tender mercy, every fiery ordeal a sign of the brightness of Thy light,  every woeful tribulation a cooling draught, every toil a blissful repose,  every anguish a fountain of gladness.\"    Whosoever, O my Lord, is impatient in the tribulations befalling him in  Thy path, hath not drunk of the cup of Thy love nor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16996"],[0,"Two Old Faiths (#19)"],[1," Weber, _History of Indian Literature_, p. 38.

Muir, in _North British Review_, No. xlix, p. 224.    [22] _Miscellaneous Writings_ (Macmillan, 1861), vol. i, p.  77.    [23] But the truth is that every man is accounted a good Hindu  who keeps the rules of caste and pays due respect to the Brahmans. What  he believes, or disbelieves, is of little or no consequence.    [24] Yaska, probably in the fifth century B.C.    [25] Weber thinks that Christian elements may have been  introduced, in course of time, into the representation.    [26] His Ramayana was written in Hindi verse in the sixteenth  century.    [27] When Jhansi was captured in the times of the great mutiny  English officers were disgusted to see the walls of the queen's palace  covered with what they described as \"grossly obscene\" pictures. There is  little or no doubt that these were simply representations of the acts of  Krishna. Therefore to the Hindu queen they were religious pictures. When  questioned about such things the Brahmans reply that deeds which would  be wicked in men were quite right in Krishna, who, being God, could do  whatever he pleased.    [28] Born probably in 1649.    [29] Raja Narayan Basu (Bose), in enumerating the sacred books  of Hinduism, excluded the philosophical systems and included the  Tantras. He was and, we believe, is a leading man in the Adi Brahma  Somaj.    [30] Barth, as above, p. 202.    [31] So writes Vans Kennedy, a good authority. The rites,  however, vary with varying places.    [32] _Asiatic Researches_, v, p. 356.    [33] Cicero.    [34] We learned from his own lips that among the books which  most deeply impressed him were the Bible and the writings of Dr.  Chalmers.    [35] See _Life of Mohammed_, p. 138. Smith & Elder.    [36] _Life of Mohammed_, p. 172, where the results are  compared.    [37] _Life of Mohammed_, p. 341; Sura ii, 257; xxix, 46.    [38] The only exceptions were the Jews of Kheibar and the  Christians of Najran, who were permitted to continue in the profession  of their faith. They were, however, forced by Omar to quit the  peninsula, which thenceforward remained exclusively Mohammedan.    \"Islam\" is a synonym for the Mussulman faith. Its original meaning is  \"surrender\" of one's self to God.    [39] _Apology of Al Kindy, the Christian_, p. 18. Smith &  Elder, 1882. This remarkable apologist will be noticed further below.

[45] _Annals of the Early Caliphate_, p. 46.    [46] See, for example, Sura lxxviii: \"Verily for the pious  there is a blissful abode: gardens and vineyards; and damsels with  swelling bosoms, of a fitting age; and a full cup. Lovely large-eyed  girls, like pearls hidden in their shells, a reward for that which the  faithful shall have wrought. Verily We have created them of a rare  creation, virgins, young and fascinating.... Modest damsels averting  their eyes, whom no man shall have known before, nor any Jinn,\" etc.    The reader will not fail to be struck by the materialistic character of  Mohammed's paradise.    [47] See Sura _Jehad_; also _Annals of the Early Caliphate_, p.  167, _et. seq._    [48] _Annals of the Early Caliphate_, p. 105, _et. seq._    [49] See _Annals_, etc., p. 253.

[55] _Apology_, p. 47, _et. seq._    [56] Alluding to the \"_Ansar_,\" or mortal \"Helpers\" of Mohammed  at Medina. Throughout, the apologist, it will be observed, is drawing a  contrast with the means used for the spread of Islam.    [57] _Apology_, p. 16.    [58] _Apology_, p. 57.    [59] I am not here comparing the value of these observances  with those of other religions. I am inquiring only how far the  obligations of Islam may be held to involve hardship or sacrifice such  as might have retarded the progress of Islam by rendering it on its  first introduction unpopular.    [60] See Sura ii, v. 88.    [61] Sura iv, 18. \"Exchange\" is the word used in the Koran.    [62] Each of his widows had 100,000 golden pieces left her.  _Life of Mohammed_, p. 171.    [63] \"These divorced wives were irrespective of his concubines  or slave-girls, upon the number and variety of whom there was no limit  or check whatever.\"--_Annals_, p. 418.    [64] Lane adds: \"There are many men in this country who, in the  course of ten years, have married as many as twenty, thirty, or more  wives; and women not far advanced in age have been wives to a dozen or  more husbands successively.\" Note that all this is entirely within the  religious sanction.    [65] _Pilgrimage to Mecca_, by her highness the reigning Begum  of Bhopal, translated by Mrs. W. Osborne (1870), pp. 82, 88. Slave-girls  cannot be _married_ until freed by their masters. What her highness  tells of women _divorcing_ their husbands is of course entirely _ultra  vires_, and shows how the laxity of conjugal relations allowed to the  male sex has extended itself to the female also, and that in a city  where, if anywhere, we should have expected to find the law observed.    [66] In India, for example, there are Mohammedan races among  whom monogamy, as a rule, prevails by custom, and individuals exercising  their right of polygamy are looked upon with disfavor. On the other  hand, we meet occasionally with men who aver that rather against their  will (as they will sometimes rather amusingly say) they have been forced  by custom or family influence to add by polygamy to their domestic  burdens. In Mohammedan countries, however, when we hear of a man  confining himself to _one wife_, it does not necessarily follow that he  has no slaves to consort with in his harem. I may remark that  slave-girls have by Mohammedan laws no conjugal rights whatever, but are  like playthings, at the absolute discretion of their master.    [67] The case of the Corinthian offender is much in point, as  showing how the strict discipline of the Church must have availed to  make Christianity unpopular with the mere worldling.    [68] [Sidenote: Laxity among nominal Christians.]  _Apology_, p. 51. I repeat, that in the remarks I have made under this  head, no comparison is sought to be drawn betwixt the morality of  nominally Christian and Moslem peoples. On this subject I may be allowed  to quote from what I have said elsewhere: \"The Moslem advocate will urge  ... the social evil as the necessary result of inexorable monogamy. The  Koran not only denounces any illicit laxity between the sexes in the  severest terms, but exposes the transgressor to condign punishment. For  this reason, and because the conditions of what is licit are so  accommodating and wide, a certain negative virtue (it can hardly be  called continence or chastity) pervades Mohammedan society, in contrast  with which the gross and systematic immorality in certain parts of every  European community may be regarded by the Christian with shame and  confusion. In a purely Mohammedan land, however low may be the general  level of moral feeling, the still lower depths of fallen humanity are  unknown. The 'social evil' and intemperance, prevalent in Christian  lands, are the strongest weapons in the armory of Islam. We point, and  justly, to the higher morality and civilization of those who do observe  the precepts of the Gospel, to the stricter unity and virtue which  cement the family, and to the elevation of the sex; but in vain, while  the example of our great cities, and too often of our representatives  abroad, belies the argument. And yet the argument is sound. For, in  proportion as Christianity exercises her legitimate influence, vice and  intemperance will wane and vanish, and the higher morality pervade the  whole body; whereas in Islam the deteriorating influences of polygamy,  divorce, and concubinage have been stereotyped for all time.\"--_The  Koran: its Composition and Teaching, and the Testimony it bears to the  Holy Scriptures_, p. 60.    [69] [Sidenote: Alleged progress of Islam in Africa.]  Much loose assertion has been made regarding the progress of Islam in  Africa; but I have found no proof of it apart from armed, political, or  trading influence, dogged too often by the slave-trade; to a great  extent a social rather than a religious movement, and raising the fetich"]]]
