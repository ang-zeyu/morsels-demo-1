(#19)"],[1,", (for  he was the prime mover in every thing,) enlarged a little some of these  limitations; but not to the degree that was requisite. A law had been  enacted during the reign of Henry IV.,[**] that no man could bind his  son or daughter to an apprenticeship, unless he were possessed of  twenty shillings a year in land; and Henry VII., because the decay  of manufactures was complained of in Norwich from the want of hands,  exempted that city from the penalties of the law.[***] Afterwards the  whole county of Norfolk obtained a like exemption with regard to some  branches of the woollen manufacture.[****] These absurd limitations  proceeded from a desire of promoting husbandry, which, however, is never  more effectually encouraged than by the increase of manufactures. For a  like reason, the law enacted against enclosures, and for the keeping up  of farm houses,[v] scarcely deserves the high praises bestowed on it by  Lord Bacon. If husbandmen understand agriculture, and have a ready vent  for their commodities, we need not dread a diminution of the people  employed in the country. All methods of supporting populousness, except  by the interest of the proprietors, are violent and ineffectual. During  a century and a half after this period, there was a frequent renewal of  laws and edicts against depopulation; whence we may infer, that none  of them were ever executed. The natural course of improvement at last  provided a remedy.         *    11 Henry VII. cap. 22.         **   11 Henry VII. cap. 11.         ***  4 Henry VII. cap. 19.         **** 4 Henry VII. cap. 17.         v    12 Henry VII. cap. 1.    One check to industry in England was the erecting of corporations;  an abuse which is not yet entirely corrected. A law was enacted, that  corporations should not pass any by-laws without the consent of three of  the chief officers of state.[*] They were prohibited from imposing tolls  at their [**] The cities of Glocester and Worcester had even imposed  tolls on the Severn, which were abolished.[***]    There is a law of this reign,[****] containing a preamble, by which  it appears, that the company of merchant adventurers in London had, by  their own authority, debarred all the other merchants of the kingdom  from trading to the great marts in the Low Countries, unless each trader  previously paid them the sum of near seventy pounds. It is surprising  that such a by-law (if it deserve the name) could ever be carried into  execution, and that the authority of parliament should be requisite to  abrogate it.    It was during this reign, on the second of August, 1492, a little before  sunset, that Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, set out from Spain on his  memorable voyage for the discovery of the western world; and a few years  after, Vasquez de Gama, a Portuguese, passed the Cape of Good Hope,  and opened a new passage to the East Indies. These great events were  attended with important consequences to all the nations of Europe, even  to such as were not immediately concerned in those naval enterprises.  The enlargement of commerce and navigation increased industry and the  arts every where; the nobles dissipated their fortunes in expensive  pleasures: men of an inferior rank both acquired a share in the landed  property, and created to themselves a considerable property of a new  kind, in stock, commodities, art, credit, and correspondence. In some  nations, the privileges of the commons increased by this increase of  property: in most nations, the kings, finding arms to be dropped by the  barons, who could no longer endure their former rude manner of life,  established standing armies, and subdued the liberties of their  kingdoms: but in all places, the condition of the people, from the  depression of the petty tyrants by whom they had formerly been oppressed  rather than governed, received great improvement, and they acquired, if  not entire liberty, at least the most considerable advantages of it. And  as the general course of events thus tended to depress the nobles and  exalt the people, Henry VII., who also embraced that system of policy,  has acquired more praise than his institutions, strictly speaking, seem  of themselves to deserve on account of any profound wisdom attending  them.         * 19 Henry VII. cap. 7 gates.         ** 19 Henry VII. cap. 8.         *** 10 Henry VII. cap. 18.         **** 12 Henry VII. cap. 6.    It was by accident only that the king had not a considerable share in  those great naval discoveries, by which the present age was so much  distinguished. Columbus, after meeting with many repulses from the  courts of Portugal and Spain sent his brother Bartholomew to London, in  order to explain his projects to Henry, and crave his protection for  the execution of them. The king invited him over to England; but  his brother, being taken by pirates, was detained in his voyage; and  Columbus, meanwhile, having obtained the countenance of Isabella, was  supplied with a small fleet, and happily executed his enterprise. Henry  was not discouraged by this disappointment: he fitted out Sebastian  Cabot, a Venetian, settled in Bristol, and sent him westwards in 1498,  in search of new countries. Cabot discovered the main land of America  towards the sixtieth degree of northern latitude: he sailed southwards  along the coast, and discovered Newfoundland and other countries; but  returned to England without making any conquest or settlement. Elliot  and other merchants in Bristol made a like attempt in 1502.[*] The king  expended fourteen thousand pounds in building one ship, called the Great  Harry.[**] She was, properly speaking, the first ship in the English  navy. Before this period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he had no  other expedient than hiring or pressing ships from the merchants.         * Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 37.         ** Stowe, p. 484.    But though this improvement of navigation, and the discovery of both the  Indies, was the most memorable incident that happened during this or  any other period, it was not the only great event by which the age was  distinguished. In 1453, Constantinople was taken by the Turks; and the  Greeks, among whom some remains of learning were still preserved, being  scattered by these barbarians, took shelter in Italy, and imported,  together with their admirable language, a tincture of their science, and  of their refined taste in poetry and eloquence About the same time, the  purity of the Latin tongue was revived, the study of antiquity became  fashionable, and the esteem for literature gradually propagated itself  throughout every nation in Europe. The art of printing, invented about  that time, extremely facilitated the progress of all these improvements:  the invention of gunpowder changed me whole art of war: mighty  innovations were soon after made in religion, such as not only affected  those states that embraced them, but even those that adhered to the  ancient faith and worship; and thus a general revolution was made in  human affairs throughout this part of the world; and men gradually  attained that situation, with regard to commerce, arts, science,  government, police, and cultivation, in which they have ever since  persevered. Here, therefore, commences the useful, as well as the  more agreeable part of modern annals; certainty has place in all the  considerable, and even most of the minute parts of historical narration;  a great variety of events, preserved by printing, give the author the  power of selecting, as well as adorning, the facts which he relates; and  as each incident has a reference to our present manners and situation,  instructive lessons occur every moment during the course of the  narration. Whoever carries his anxious researches into preceding  periods, is moved by a curiosity, liberal indeed and commendable; not by  any necessity for acquiring knowledge of public affairs, or the arts of  civil government.          CHAPTER XXVII.          HENRY VIII.    {1509.} THE death of Henry VII. had been attended with as open and  visible a joy among the people as decency would permit; and the  accession and coronation of his son, Henry VIII., spread universally  a declared and unfeigned satisfaction. Instead of a monarch jealous,  severe, and avaricious, who, in proportion as he advanced in years,  was sinking still deeper in those unpopular vices, a young prince of  eighteen had succeeded to the throne, who, even in the eyes of men of  sense, gave promising hopes of his future conduct, much more in those of  the people, always enchanted with novelty, youth, and royal dignity.  The beauty and vigor of his person, accompanied with dexterity in  every manly exercise, was further adorned with a blooming and ruddy  countenance, with a lively air, with the appearance of spirit and  activity in all his demeanor.[*] His father, in order to remove him from  the knowledge of public business, had hitherto occupied him entirely in  the pursuits of literature; and the proficiency which he made gave  no bad prognostic of his parts and capacity.[**] Even the vices of  vehemence, ardor, and impatience, to which he was subject, and which  afterwards degenerated into tyranny, were considered only as faults  incident to unguarded youth, which would be corrected when time had  brought him to greater moderation and maturity. And as the contending  titles of York and Lancaster were now at last fully united in his  person, men justly expected, from a prince obnoxious to no party, that  impartiality of administration which had long been unknown in England.         * T. Mori. Lucubr. p. 182.         ** Father Paul, lib. i.    These favorable prepossessions of the public were encouraged by the  measures which Henry embraced in the commencement of his reign. His  grandmother, the countess of Richmond and Derby, was still alive; and  as she was a woman much celebrated for prudence and virtue, he wisely  showed great deference to her opinion in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19214"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part D. (#19)"],[1,"ring, much beyond  his rank and education; and he made so good use of the access which  fortune had procured him, that he was soon regarded as the chief  confidant, and even minister of the queen. He was consulted on all  occasions; no favors could be obtained but by his intercession; all  suitors were obliged to gain him by presents and flattery; and the  man, insolent from his new exaltation, as well as rapacious in his  acquisitions, soon drew on himself the hatred of the nobility and of  the whole kingdom.[*] He had at first employed his credit to promote  Darnley's marriage; and a firm friendship seemed to be established  between them; but on the subsequent change of the queen's sentiments,  it was easy for Henry's friends to persuade him that Rizzio was the real  author of her indifference, and even to rouse in his mind jealousies of  a more dangerous nature. The favorite was of a disagreeable figure, but  was not past his youth;[**] [8] and though the opinion of his criminal  correspondence with Mary might seem of itself unreasonable, if not  absurd, a suspicious husband could find no other means of accounting for  that lavish and imprudent kindness with which she honored him.         * Keith, p. 282, 302, Crawford's Memoirs, p. 5. Spotswood,       p. 193.         ** See note H, at the end of the volume.    The rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, who could admit of no  freedoms, contributed to spread this opinion among the people; and as  Rizzio was universally believed to be a pensionary of the pope's, and to  be deeply engaged in all schemes against the Protestants, any story to  his and Mary's disadvantage received an easy credit among the zealots of  that communion. Rizzio, who had connected his interests with the  Roman Catholics, was the declared enemy of the banished lords; and by  promoting the violent prosecutions against them, he had exposed himself  to the animosity of their numerous friends and retainers. A scheme  was also thought to be formed for revoking some exorbitant grants made  during the queen's minority, and even the nobility, who had seized the  ecclesiastical benefices, began to think themselves less secure in the  possession of them.[*] The earl of Morton, chancellor, was affected by  all these considerations, and still more by a rumor spread abroad, that  Mary intended to appoint Rizzio chancellor in his place, and to bestow  that dignity on a mean and upstart foreigner, ignorant of the laws and  language of the country.[**] So indiscreet had this princess been in her  kindness to Rizzio, that even that strange report met with credit, and  proved a great means of accelerating the ruin of the favorite. Morton,  insinuating himself into Henry's confidence, employed all his art to  inflame the discontent and jealousy of that prince; and he persuaded  him, that the only means of freeing himself from the indignities under  which he labored, was to bring the base stranger to the fate which he  had so well merited, and which was so passionately desired by the  whole nation. George Douglas, natural brother to the countess of Lenox,  concurred in the same advice; and the Lords Ruthven and Lindesey, being  consulted, offered their assistance in the enterprise; nor was even  the earl of Lenox, the king's father, averse to the design.[***] But  as these conspirators were well acquainted with Henry's levity, they  engaged him to sign a paper, in which he avowed the undertaking, as  tending to the glory of God and advancement of religion, and promised  to protect them against every consequence which might ensue upon the  assassination of Rizzio.[****] All these measures being concerted, a  messenger was despatched to the banished lords, who were hovering near  the borders; and they were invited by the king to return to their native  country.         * Keith, p. 326. Melvil, p. 64.         ** Buchanan, lib. xvii. c. 60. Crawford, p. 6. Spotswood, p.       194. Knox, p. 393. Jebb, vol. i. p. 456.         *** Crawford, p. 7.         **** Goodall, vol. i. p. 266. Crawford, p. 7.    This design, so atrocious in itself, was rendered still more so by the  circumstances which attended its execution. Mary, who was in the sixth  month of her pregnancy, was supping in private, and had at table the  countess of Argyle, her natural sister, with Rizzio, and others of her  servants. The king entered the room by a private passage, and stood  at the back of Mary's chair: Lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and other  conspirators, being all armed, rushed in after him; and the queen of  Scots, terrified with the appearance, demanded of them the reason of  this rude intrusion. They told her, that they intended no violence  against her person; but meant only to bring that villain, pointing to  Rizzio, to his deserved punishment. Rizzio, aware of the danger, ran  behind his mistress, and seizing her by the waist, called aloud to her  for protection; while she interposed in his behalf, with cries, and  menaces, and entreaties. The impatient assassins, regardless of her  efforts, rushed upon their prey, and by overturning every thing which  stood in their way, increased the horror and confusion of the scene.  Douglas, seizing Henry's dagger, stuck it in the body of Rizzio,  who, screaming with fear and agony, was torn from Mary by the other  conspirators, and pushed into the ante-chamber, where he was despatched  with fifty-six wounds.[*]         * Melvil, p. 64. Keith, p. 330, 331. Crawford, p. 9.    The unhappy princess, informed of his fate, immediately dried her tears,  and said, she would weep no more; she would now think of revenge. The  insult, indeed, upon her person; the stain attempted to be fixed on  her honor; the danger to which her life was exposed, on account of her  pregnancy; were injuries so atrocious and so complicated, that they  scarcely left room for pardon, even from the greatest lenity and mercy.    The assassins, apprehensive of Mary's resentment, detained her prisoner  in the palace; and the king dismissed all who seemed willing to attempt  her rescue, by telling them, that nothing was done without his orders,  and that he would be careful of the queen's safety. Murray and the  banished lords appeared two days after; and Mary, whose anger was now  engrossed by injuries more recent and violent, was willingly reconciled  to them; and she even received her brother with tenderness and  affection. They obtained an acquittal from parliament, and were  reinstated in their honors and fortunes. The accomplices also in  Rizzio's murder applied to her for a pardon; but she artfully delayed  compliance, and persuaded them, that so long as she was detained in  custody, and was surrounded by guards, any deed which she should sign  would have no validity. Meanwhile she had gained the confidence of her  husband by her persuasion and caresses and no sooner were the guards  withdrawn, than she engaged him to escape with her in the night-time,  and take shelter in Dunbar. Many of her subjects here offered her their  services; and Mary, having collected an army, which the conspirators had  no power to resist, advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged them to fly  into England, where they lived in great poverty and distress. They  made applications, however, to the earl of Bothwell, a new favorite of  Mary's; and that nobleman, desirous of strengthening his party by the  accession of their interest, was able to pacify her resentment; and he  soon after procured them liberty to return into their own country.[*]    The vengeance of the queen of Scots was implacable against her husband  alone, whose person was before disagreeable to her, and who, by his  violation of every tie of gratitude and duty, had now drawn on him her  highest resentment. She engaged him to disown all connections with the  assassins, to deny any concurrence in their crime, even to publish a  proclamation containing a falsehood so notorious to the whole world;[**]  and having thus made him expose himself to universal contempt, and  rendered it impracticable for him ever to acquire the confidence of any  party, she threw him off with disdain and indignation.[***]         * Melvil, p. 75, 76.

As if she had been making an escape from him, she suddenly withdrew  to Allca, a seat of the earl of Marre's; and when Henry followed her  thither, she suddenly returned to Edinburgh and give him every where the  strongest proofs of displeasure, and even of antipathy. She encouraged  her courtiers in their neglect of him; and she was pleased that his mean  equipage and small train of attendants should draw on him the contempt  of the very populace. He was permitted, however, to have apartments  in the Castle of Edinburgh, which Mary had chosen for the place of her  delivery. She there brought forth a son; and as this was very important  news to England, as well as to Scotland, she immediately despatched  Sir James Melvil to carry intelligence of the happy event to Elizabeth.  Melvil tells us, that this princess, the evening of his arrival in  London, had given a ball to her court at Greenwich, and was displaying  all that spirit and alacrity which usually attended her on these  occasions: but when news arrived of the prince of Scotland's birth, all  her joy was damped: she sunk into melancholy; she reclined her head upon  her arm; and complained to some of her attendants, that the queen of  Scots was mother of a fair son, while she herself was but a barren  stock. Next day, however, at the reception of the ambassador, she  resumed her former dissimulation, put on a joyful countenance, gave  Melvil thanks for the haste he had made in conveying to her the  agreeable intelligence, and expressed the utmost cordiality and  friendship to her sister.[*] Some time after, she despatched the earl of  Bedford, with her kinsman George Gary, son of Lord"]]]
