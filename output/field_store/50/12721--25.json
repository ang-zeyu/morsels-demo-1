You  will find some day, to your cost, if you believe the first part of it,  that it is not true; but you may never, if you believe the second part  of it, find, to your gain, that also, untrue; and therefore I pray you  with all earnestness to prove, and know within your hearts, that all  things lovely and righteous are possible for those who believe in their  possibility, and who determine that, for their part, they will make  every day's work contribute to them. Let every dawn of morning be to you  as the beginning of life, and every setting sun be to you as its  close:--then let every one of these short lives leave its sure record of  some kindly thing done for others--some goodly strength or knowledge  gained for yourselves; so, from day to day, and strength to strength,  you shall build up indeed, by Art, by Thought, and by Just Will, an  Ecclesia of England, of which it shall not be said, \"See what manner of  stones are here,\" but, \"See what manner of men.\"          LECTURE V    LINE      126. You will, I doubt not, willingly permit me to begin your lessons in  real practice of art in the words of the greatest of English painters:  one also, than whom there is indeed no greater, among those of any  nation, or any time,--our own gentle Reynolds.    He says in his first discourse:--\"The Directors\" (of the Academy) \"ought  more particularly to watch over the genius of those students, who being  more advanced, are arrived at that critical period of study, on the nice  management of which their future turn of taste depends. At that age it  is natural for them to be more captivated with what is brilliant, than  with what is solid, and to prefer splendid negligence to painful and  humiliating exactness.\"    \"A facility in composing, a lively and, what is called, a 'masterly'  handling of the chalk or pencil, are, it must be confessed, captivating  qualities to young minds, and become of course the objects of their  ambition. They endeavour to imitate these dazzling excellences, which  they will find no great labour in attaining. After much time spent in  these frivolous pursuits, the difficulty will be to retreat; but it will  then be too late; and there is scarce an instance of return to  scrupulous labour, after the mind has been debauched and deceived by  this fallacious mastery.\"      127. I read you these words, chiefly that Sir Joshua, who founded, as  first President, the Academical schools of English painting, in these  well-known discourses, may also begin, as he has truest right to do, our  system of instruction in this University. But secondly, I read them that  I may press on your attention these singular words, \"painful and  humiliating exactness.\" Singular, as expressing the first conditions of  the study required from his pupils by the master, who, of all men except  Velasquez, seems to have painted with the greatest ease. It is true that  he asks this pain, this humiliation, only from youths who intend to  follow the profession of artists. But if you wish yourselves to know  anything of the practice of art, you must not suppose that because your  study will be more desultory than that of Academy students, it may  therefore be less accurate. The shorter the time you have to give, the  more careful you should be to spend it profitably; and I would not wish  you to devote one hour to the practice of drawing, unless you are  resolved to be informed in it of all that in an hour can be taught.      128. I speak of the practice of _drawing_ only; though elementary study  of modelling may perhaps some day be advisably connected with it; but I  do not wish to disturb, or amuse, you with a formal statement of the  manifold expectations I have formed respecting your future work. You  will not, I am sure, imagine that I have begun without a plan, nor blame  my reticence as to the parts of it which cannot yet be put into  execution, and which there may occur reason afterwards to modify. My  first task must unquestionably be to lay before you right and simple  methods of drawing and colouring.    I use the word \"colouring\" without reference to any particular vehicle  of colour, for the laws of good painting are the same, whatever liquid  is employed to dissolve the pigments. But the technical management of  oil is more difficult than that of water-colour, and the impossibility  of using it with safety among books or prints, and its unavailableness  for note-book sketches and memoranda, are sufficient reasons for not  introducing it in a course of practice intended chiefly for students of  literature. On the contrary, in the exercises of artists, oil should be  the vehicle of colour employed from the first. The extended practice of  water-colour painting, as a separate skill, is in every way harmful to  the arts: its pleasant slightness and plausible dexterity divert the  genius of the painter from its proper aims, and withdraw the attention  of the public from excellence of higher claim; nor ought any man, who  has the consciousness of ability for good work, to be ignorant of, or  indolent in employing, the methods of making its results permanent as  long as the laws of Nature allow. It is surely a severe lesson to us in  this matter, that the best works of Turner could not be shown to the  public for six months without being destroyed,--and that his most  ambitious ones for the most part perished, even before they could be  shown. I will break through my law of reticence, however, so far as to  tell you that I have hope of one day interesting you greatly (with the  help of the Florentine masters), in the study of the arts of moulding  and painting porcelain; and to induce some of you to use your future  power of patronage in encouraging the various branches of this art, and  turning the attention of the workmen of Italy from the vulgar tricks of  minute and perishable mosaic to the exquisite subtilties of form and  colour possible in the perfectly ductile, afterwards unalterable clay.  And one of the ultimate results of such craftsmanship might be the  production of pictures as brilliant as painted glass,--as delicate as  the most subtle water-colours, and more permanent than the Pyramids.      129. And now to begin our own work. In order that we may know how  rightly to learn to draw and to paint, it will be necessary, will it  not, that we know first what we are to aim at doing;--what kind of  representation of nature is best?    I will tell you in the words of Lionardo. \"That is the most praiseworthy  painting which has most conformity with the thing represented,\" \"quella  pittura e piu laudabile, la quale ha piu conformita con la cosa mitata,\"  (ch. 276). In plain terms, \"the painting which is likest nature is the  best.\" And you will find by referring to the preceding chapter, \"come lo  specchio e maestro de' pittori,\" how absolutely Lionardo means what he  says. Let the living thing, (he tells us,) be reflected in a mirror,  then put your picture beside the reflection, and match the one with the  other. And indeed, the very best painting is unquestionably so like the  mirrored truth, that all the world admits its excellence. Entirely  first-rate work is so quiet and natural that there can be no dispute  over it; you may not particularly admire it, but you will find no fault  with it. Second-rate painting pleases one person much, and displeases  another; but first-rate painting pleases all a little, and intensely  pleases those who can recognise its unostentatious skill.      130. This, then, is what we have first got to do--to make our drawing  look as like the thing we have to draw as we can.    Now, all objects are seen by the eye as patches of colour of a certain  shape, with gradations of colour within them. And, unless their colours  be actually luminous, as those of the sun, or of fire, these patches of  different hues are sufficiently imitable, except so far as they are seen  stereoscopically. You will find Lionardo again and again insisting on  the stereoscopic power of the double sight: but do not let that trouble  you; you can only paint what you can see from one point of sight, but  that is quite enough. So seen, then, all objects appear to the human eye  simply as masses of colour of variable depth, texture, and outline. The  outline of any object is the limit of its mass, as relieved against  another mass. Take a crocus, and lay it on a green cloth. You will see  it detach itself as a mere space of yellow from the green behind it, as  it does from the grass. Hold it up against the window--you will see it  detach itself as a dark space against the white or blue behind it. In  either case its outline is the limit of the space of light or dark  colour by which it expresses itself to your sight. That outline is  therefore infinitely subtle--not even a line, but the place of a line,  and that, also, made soft by texture. In the finest painting it is  therefore slightly softened; but it is necessary to be able to draw it  with absolute sharpness and precision. The art of doing this is to be  obtained by drawing it as an actual line, which art is to be the subject  of our immediate enquiry; but I must first lay the divisions of the  entire subject completely before you.      131. I have said that all objects detach themselves as masses of  colour. Usually, light and shade are thought of as separate from colour;  but the fact is that all nature is seen as a mosaic composed of gradated  portions of different colours, dark or light. There is no difference in  the quality of these colours, except as affected by texture. You will  constantly hear lights and shades spoken of as if these were different  in their nature, and to be painted in different ways. But every light is  a shadow compared to higher lights, till we reach the brightness of the  sun; and every shadow is a light compared to lower shadows,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#19)"],[1,"word to give a clue to what he  was saying. But it struck her that his voice did not sound quite  natural; not so Swedish, not so careful.    Frank came tiptoeing out of the room where Brit lay bandaged and  unconscious and stood close to Lorraine, looking down at her solemnly.    \"How 'n 'ell did he git here--the doctor?\" he demanded, making a great  effort to hold his voice down to a whisper, and forgetting now and then.  \"How'd _he_ know Brit rolled off'n the grade? Us here, _we_ never knowed  it, and I was tryin' to send him back when you came. He said somebody  telephoned there was a man hurt in a runaway. There ain't a telephone  closer'n the Sawtooth, and that there's a good twenty mile and more from  where Brit was hurt. It's damn funny.\"    \"Yes, it is,\" Lorraine admitted uncomfortably. \"I don't know any more  than you do about it.\"    \"Well, how'n 'ell did it happen? Brit, he oughta know enough to  rough-lock down that hill. An' that team ain't a runaway team. _I_ never  had no trouble with 'em--they're good at holdin' a load. They'll set  down an' slide but what they'll hold 'er. What become of the horses?\"    \"Why--they're over there yet. We forgot all about the horses, I think.  Caroline was standing up, all right. The other horse may be killed. I  don't know--it was lying down. And Yellowjacket was up that little gully  just this side of the wreck, when I left him. They did try to hold the  load, Frank. Something must have happened to the brake. I saw dad  crawling out from under the wagon just before I got to where the load  was standing. Or some one did. I think it was dad. But Caroline kicked  my horse down off the road, and I only saw him a minute--but it _must_  have been dad. And then, a little way down the hill, something went  wrong.\"    Frank seemed trying to reconstruct the accident from Lorraine's  description. \"He'd no business to start down if his rough-lock wasn't  all right,\" he said. \"It ain't like him. Brit's careful about them  things--little men most always are. I don't see how 'n 'ell it worked  loose. It's a damn queer layout all around; and this here doctor gitting  here ahead of you folks, that there is the queerest. What's he say about  Brit? Think he'll pull through?\"    The doctor himself, coming up just then, answered the question. Of  course the patient would pull through! What were doctors for? As to his  reason for coming, he referred them to Mr. Vjolmar, whom he thought  could better explain the matter.    The three of them waited,--five of them, since Jim and Sorry had come  up, anxious to hear the doctor's opinion and anything else pertaining to  the affair. Swan was coming slowly from the bunk-house, buttoning his  coat. He seemed to feel that they were waiting for him and to know why.  His manner was diffident, deprecating even.    \"We may as well go in out of the mosquitoes,\" the doctor suggested. \"And  I wish you would tell these people what you told me, young man. Don't be  afraid to speak frankly; it is rather amazing but not at all  impossible, as I can testify. In fact,\" he added dryly, \"my presence  here ought to settle any doubt of that. Just tell them, young man, about  your mother.\"    Swan was the last to enter the kitchen, and he stood leaning against the  closed door, turning his old hat round and round, his eyes going swiftly  from face to face. They were watching him, and Swan blushed a deep red  while he told them about his mother in Boise, and how he could talk to  her with his thoughts. He explained laboriously how the thoughts from  her came like his mother speaking in his head, and that his thoughts  reached her in the same way. He said that since he was a little boy they  could talk together with their thoughts, but people laughed and some  called them crazy, so that now he did not like to have somebody know  that he could do it.    \"But Brit Hunter's hurt bad, so a doctor must come quick, or I think he  maybe will die. It takes too long to ride a horse to Echo from this  ranch, so I call on my mother, and I tell my mother a doctor must come  quick to this ranch. So my mother sends a telephone to this doctor in  Shoshone, and he comes. That is all. But I would not like it if  everybody maybe finds it out that I do that, and makes talk about it.\"    He looked straight at Jim and Sorry, and those two unprepossessing ones  looked at each other and at Swan and at the doctor and at each other  again, and headed for the door. But Swan was leaning against it, and his  eyes were on them. \"I would like it if you say somebody rides to get the  doctor,\" he hinted quietly.    Sorry looked at Jim. \"I rode like hell,\" he stated heavily. \"I leave it  to Jim.\"    \"You shore'n hell did!\" Jim agreed, and Swan removed his big form from  the door.    \"You boys goin' over t' Spirit Canyon?\" Frank wanted to know.    \"Yeah,\" said Sorry, answering for them both, and they went out, giving  Swan a sidelong look of utter bafflement as they passed him. Talking by  the thought route from Spirit Canyon to Boise City was evidently a bit  too much for even their phlegmatic souls to contemplate with perfect  calm.    \"They'll keep it to theirselves, whether they believe it or not,\" Frank  assured Swan in his labored whisper. \"It don't go down with me. I ain't  supe'stitious enough fer that.\"    \"The doctor he comes, don't he?\" Swan retorted. \"I shall go back now and  milk the cows and do chores.\"    \"But if your shoulder is lame, Swan, how can you?\" Lorraine asked in her  unexpected fashion.    Swan swallowed and looked helplessly at the doctor, who stood smoothing  his chin. \"The muscle strain is not serious,\" he said calmly. \"A little  gentle exercise will prevent further trouble, I think.\" Whereupon he  turned abruptly to the door of the other room, glanced in at Brit and  beckoned Lorraine with an upraised finger.    \"You have had a hard time of it yourself, young lady,\" he told her. \"You  needn't worry about Swan. He is not suffering appreciably. I shall mix  you a very unpleasant dose of medicine, and then I want you to go to bed  and sleep. I shall stay with your father to-night; not that it is  necessary, but because I prefer daylight for the trip back to town. So  there is no reason why you should sit up and wear yourself out. You will  have plenty of time to do that while your father's bones mend.\"    He proceeded to mix the unpleasant dose, which Lorraine swallowed and  straightway forgot, in the muddle of thoughts that whirled confusingly  in her brain. Little things distressed her oddly, while her father's  desperate state left her numb. She lay down on the cot in the farther  corner of the kitchen where her father had slept just last night--it  seemed so long ago!--and almost immediately, as her senses recorded it,  bright sunlight was shining into the room.          CHAPTER THIRTEEN    LONE TAKES HIS STAND      Lone Morgan, over at Elk Spring camp, was just sitting down to eat his  midday meal when some one shouted outside. Lone stiffened in his chair,  felt under his coat, and then got up with some deliberation and looked  out of the window before he went to the door. All this was a matter of  habit, bred of Lone's youth in the feud country, and had nothing  whatever to do with his conscience.    \"Hello!\" he called, standing in the doorway and grinning a welcome to  Swan, who stood with one arm resting on the board gate. \"She's on the  table--come on in.\"    \"I don't know if you're home with the door shut like that,\" Swan  explained, coming up to the cabin. \"I chased a coyote from Rock City to  here, and by golly, he's going yet! I'll get him sometime, maybe. He's  smart, but you can beat anything with thinking if you don't stop  thinking. Always the other feller stops sometimes, and then you get  him. You believe that?\"    \"It most generally works out that way,\" Lone admitted, getting another  plate and cup from the cupboard, which was merely a box nailed with its  bottom to the wall, and a flour sack tacked across the front for a  curtain. \"Even a coyote slips up now and then, I reckon.\"    Swan sat down, smoothing his tousled yellow hair with both hands as he  did so. \"By golly, my shoulder is sore yet from carrying Brit Hunter,\"  he remarked carelessly, flexing his muscles and grimacing a little.    Lone was pouring the coffee, and he ran Swan's cup over before he  noticed what he was doing. Swan looked up at him and looked away again,  reaching for a cloth to wipe the spilled coffee from the table.    \"How was that?\" Lone asked, turning away to the stove. \"What-all  happened to Brit Hunter?\"    Swan, with his plate filled and his coffee well sweetened, proceeded to  relate with much detail the story of Brit's misfortune. \"By golly, I  don't see how he don't get killed,\" he finished, helping himself to  another biscuit. \"By _golly_, I don't. Falling into Spirit Canyon is  like getting dragged by a horse. It should kill a man. What you think,  Lone?\"    \"It didn't, you say.\" Lone's eyes were turned to his coffee cup.    \"It don't kill Brit Hunter--not yet. I think maybe he dies with all his  bones broke, like that. By golly, that shows you what could happen if a  man don't think. Brit should look at that chain on his wheel before he  starts down that road.\"    \"Oh. His brake didn't hold, eh?\"    \"I look at that wagon,\" Swan answered carefully. \"It is something funny  about that chain. I worked hauling logs in the mountains, once. It is  something damn funny about that chain, the way it's fixed.\"    Lone did not ask him for particulars, as perhaps Swan expected. He did  not speak at all for awhile, but presently pushed back his plate as if  his appetite were gone.    \"It's like Fred Thurman,\" Swan continued moralizing. \"If Fred don't ride  backwards, I bet he don't get killed--like that.\"    \"Where's Brit now?\" Lone asked, getting up and putting on his hat. \"At  the ranch?\"    \"Or heaven, maybe,\" Swan responded sententiously. \"But my dog Yack, he  "]]]
