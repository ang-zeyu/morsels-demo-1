Since coming to New York, I have  learned _Aida_, which I did not know before, and have already appeared  in it. It was learned thoroughly in eight days. Now I am at work on  _Madame Butterfly_.      TECHNICAL PRACTICE    \"I work regularly every morning on vocal technic. Not necessarily a  whole hour at a stretch, as some do; but as much time as I feel I need.  I give practically my whole day to study, so that I can make frequent  short pauses in technical practice. If technic is studied with complete  concentration and vigor, as it always should be, it is much more  fatiguing than singing an opera role.    \"You ask about the special forms of exercises I use. I sing all the  scales, one octave each--once slow and once fast--all in one breath.  Then I sing triplets on each tone, as many as I can in one breath. I can  sing about fifteen now, but I shall doubtless increase the number. For  all these I use full power of tone. Another form of exercise is to take  one tone softly, then go to the octave above, which tone is also sung  softly, but there is a large crescendo made between the two soft tones.  My compass is three octaves--from C below middle C, to two octaves above  that point. I also have C sharp, but I do not practice it, for I know I  can reach it if I need it, and I save my voice. Neither do I work on the  final tones of the lowest octave, for the same reason--to preserve the  voice.      BREATH CONTROL    \"Every singer knows how important is the management of the breath. I  always hold the chest up, taking as long breaths as I can conveniently  do. The power to hold the breath, and sing more and more tones with one  breath, grows with careful, intelligent practice. There are no rules  about the number of phrases you can sing with a single breath. A teacher  will tell you; if you can sing two phrases with one breath, do so; if  not, take breath between. It all rests with the singer.      MEMORIZING    \"I learn words and music of a role at the same time, for one helps the  other. When I have mastered a role, I know it absolutely, words, music  and accompaniment. I can always play my accompaniments, for I understand  the piano. I am always at work on repertoire, even at night. I don't  seem to need very much sleep, I think, and I often memorize during the  night; that is such a good time to work, for all is so quiet and still.  I lie awake thinking of the music, and in this way I learn it. Or,  perhaps it learns itself. For when I retire the music is not yet  mastered, not yet my own, but when morning comes I really know it.    \"Of course I must know the words with great exactness, especially in  songs. I shall do English songs in my coming song recital work, and the  words and diction must be perfect, or people will criticize my English.  I always write out the words of my roles, so as to be sure I understand  them and have them correctly memorized.      KEEPING UP REPERTOIRE    \"Most singers, I believe, need a couple of days--sometimes longer--in  which to review a role. I never use the notes or score when going over a  part in which I have appeared, for I know them absolutely, so there is  no occasion to use the notes. Other singers appear frequently at  rehearsal with their books, but I never take mine. My intimate knowledge  of score, when I assisted my father in taking charge of operatic scores,  is always a great help to me. I used to take charge of all the scores  for him, and knew all the cuts, changes and just how they were to be  used. The singers themselves often came to me for stage directions about  their parts, knowing I had this experience.    \"Yes, as you suggest, I could sing here in winter, then in South America  in summer.\" (Miss Muzio accomplished this recently, with distinguished  success and had many thrilling adventures incident to travel.) \"This  would mean I would have no summer at all, for that season with them is  colder than we have it here. No, I want my summer for rest and study.  During the season at the Metropolitan I give up everything for my art. I  refuse all society and the many invitations I receive to be guest of  honor here and there. I remain quietly at home, steadfastly at work. My  art means everything to me, and I must keep myself in the best condition  possible, to be ready when the call comes to sing. One cannot do both,  you know; art and society do not mix well. I have never disappointed an  audience; it would be a great calamity to be obliged to do so.\"          XVII    =EDWARD JOHNSON=    (=EDOUARDO DI GIOVANNI=)    THE EVOLUTON OF AN OPERA STAR      The story of Edward Johnson's musical development should prove an  incentive, nay more, a beacon light along the path of consistent  progress toward the goal of vocal and operatic achievement. Indeed as a  tiny child he must have had the desire to become a singer. A friend  speaks of musical proclivities which began to show themselves at an  early age, and describes visits of the child to their home, where, in a  little Lord Fauntleroy suit, he would stand up before them all and sing  a whole recital of little songs, to the delight of all his relatives.  The singer's progress, from the musical child on and up to that of an  operatic artist, has been rational and healthy, with nothing hectic or  overwrought about it; a constant, gradual ascent of the mountain. And  while an enviable vantage ground has been reached, such an artist must  feel there are yet other heights to conquer. For even excellence,  already achieved, requires constant effort to be held at high water  mark. And the desire for greater perfection, which every true artist  must feel, is a never-ending urge to continued struggle.    In a recent conversation with the tenor, Mr. Johnson spoke of early  days, when he desired above everything else to become a musician and  follow a musical career, though his family expected him to enter the  business world. He came to New York to look the ground over, hoping  there might be opportunity to continue his studies and make his way at  the same time. He was fortunate enough to secure a church position, and  sang subsequently in some of the best New York and Brooklyn churches.  After this period he did much concert work, touring through the Middle  West with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and singing in many Music  Festivals throughout the country.    [Illustration: Edward Johnson]    But church and concert singing did not entirely satisfy; he longed to  try his hand at opera,--in short to make an operatic career. He was well  aware that he would not find this field nor gain the necessary  experience in America; he must go to Italy, the land of song, to gain  the required training and experience. He was also fully aware of the  fact that there was plenty of hard work, and probably many  disappointments before him, but he did not shrink from either.    \"Fortunately, I have a fund of humor,\" he said, and there was a twinkle  in his eye as he spoke. \"It is a saving grace, as you say; without it I  believe I should have many times given up in sheer despair.\"    Mr. Johnson went to Italy in 1909, beginning at once his studies with  Lombardi, in Florence. In the ten years of his absence from his home  land he has built up a reputation and made a career in the great  operatic centers of Italy, Spain and South America. After his debut in  Padua, he became leading tenor at La Scala, Milan, for five consecutive  seasons. In Rome he spent four seasons at the Costanzi Theater, in the  meantime making two visits to the Colon Theater, Buenos Aires, and  filling engagements in Madrid, Bologna, Florence and Genoa.    \"How could I stay away from America for such a length of time? you ask.  For various reasons. I was getting what I had come to Italy for,  experience and reputation. I was comfortable and happy in my work. I  loved the beautiful country, and the life suited me. The people were  kind. I had my own home in Florence, which is still there and to which I  can return when my season is over here. Best of all I had the  opportunity of creating all the new tenor roles in the recent operas of  Puccini, Montemezzi, Pizzetti and Gratico. I also created the role of  _Parsifal_ in Italian, and the first season at La Scala, it was  performed twenty-seven times.\"    \"With your permission let us go a little into detail in regard to the  needs of the young singer and his method of study, so that he may  acquire vocal mastery. What do you consider the most important and  necessary subject for the young singer, or any one who wishes to enter  the profession, to consider?\"    \"A musical education,\" was the prompt, unhesitating reply. \"So many  think if they have a good natural voice and take singing lessons, that  is quite sufficient; they will soon become singers. But a singer should  also be a musician. He should learn the piano by all means and have some  knowledge of theory and harmony. These subjects will be of the greatest  benefit in developing his musicianship; indeed he cannot well get on  without them. A beautiful voice with little musical education, is not of  as much value to its possessor as one not so beautiful, which has been  well trained and is coupled with solid musical attainments.      A MUSICAL CAREER    \"If one goes in for a musical career, one should realize at the start,  something of what it means, what is involved, and what must go with it.  Singing itself is only a part, perhaps even the smaller part, of one's  equipment. If opera be the goal, there are languages, acting, make up,  impersonation, interpretation, how to walk, how to carry oneself, all to  be added to the piano and harmony we have already spoken of. The art of  the singer is a profession--yes, and a business too. You prepare  yourself to fill a public demand; you must prove yourself worthy, you  must come up to the standard, or there will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#19)"],[1,"Peaches with Jelly Garnish    Corn Puffs and Dates    Top of Milk    Rye Muffins    Coffee    LUNCHEON OR SUPPER      Macaroni and cheese    Corn and Rice Muffins    Canned Fruit    Cocoa    DINNER      Cream of Carrot Soup    Swiss Steak    Stewed Tomatoes    Natural Rice    Cole Slaw    Oatmeal Rolls    Brown Betty      5    BREAKFAST      Baked Apples with Marmalade Center    Cream of Grits Cereal    Top of Milk    Rye Finger Rolls    Coffee    LUNCHEON OR SUPPER      Cream of Lentil Soup    Corn Muffins    Prunes    Hot Tea    DINNER      Casserole of Beef and Rice    Baked Potatoes    Stewed Corn    Cabbage Salad    Chocolate Cornstarch Pudding          MEATLESS DAY MENUS    1    BREAKFAST      Baked Pears with Cloves and Ginger    Cornmeal and Farina Cereal    Coffee    Toast    LUNCHEON OR SUPPER      Welsh Rarebit    Hot Tea    Fruit Muffins    Lettuce Salad    DINNER      Cream of Corn Soup    Baked Fish    Macaroni with Tomato Sauce    Whole Wheat Bread    Lyonnaise Potatoes    Orange Sago Custard      2    BREAKFAST      Dried Peaches    Fried Hominy    Marmalade    Coffee    Popovers    LUNCHEON OR SUPPER      Bean Soup    Lettuce Salad    Cheese Straws    Olives    DINNER      Chicken Fricassee    Dumplings    Baked Squash    Peas    Cranberry Jelly    Barley Muffins    Mock Mince Pie      3    BREAKFAST      Oranges    Pearled Barley    Top Milk    Currant Jelly    Rye Bread Toasted    Coffee    LUNCHEON OR SUPPER      Mixed Vegetable Salad    Boston Brown Bread    Hot Tea    DINNER      Clam Chowder    Spinach and Cheese Loaf    Carrots    Creamed Cauliflower    Oatmeal Nut Bread    Spice Pudding    Hard Sauce          MEAT SUBSTITUTE DINNERS      Consomme with Spaghetti    Cornmeal Muffins    Cabbage and Cheese    Julienne Potatoes    Carrots    Dressed Lettuce    Jellied Prunes with Nuts      Thin Bean Soup    Rye Rolls    Corn and Oyster Fritters    Baked Potato    Scalloped Tomato    Apple and Celery Salad    Graham Pudding with Hard Sauce      Consomme with Tapioca    Brown Bread    Salmon Loaf or Escalloped Salmon    Creamed Potatoes    Peas    Lettuce Salad    Gelatine Dessert      Thin Cream of Celery Soup    Rye Bread    Nut Loaf    Brown Sauce    Scalloped Potatoes    Spinach    Lettuce Salad with Tomato Jelly    Sago Pudding      Scalloped Hominy and Cheese    Swiss Chard or Spinach    Whole Wheat Bread    Stuffed Baked Potato    Baked Pears    Molasses Cookies      Escalloped Codfish    Baked Onions    Corn Bread    Apple Salad    Fig and Date Pudding with Tart Jelly      Cream of Barley Soup    Turkish Pilaf    War Muffins    Apple and Cabbage Salad    Chocolate Bread Pudding      Cream of Rice Soup    Rye Meal Rolls    Kidney Bean Croquette    Greens    Dried Apricot Butter    Oranges, Bananas and Dates    Ginger Cookies      Bean Soup    Welsh Rarebit or a Cheese Dish    Natural Rice    Tomato Sauce    Corn Meal Parker House Rolls    Dried Peach Pudding          VEGETABLE DINNERS      Corn Soup    Oatmeal Bread    Nut Loaf    Tomato Sauce    Green Beans    Potatoes au Gratin    Jellied Prunes      Boston Roast    Tart Jelly    Whole Wheat Bread    Creamed Cauliflower    Squash    Cranberry Slump      Kidney Beans with Rice    Fried Apples with Raisins    Celery in Brown Sauce    Cornmeal Baking Powder Biscuits    Tapioca Cream      Baked Beans    Boston Brown Bread    Spinach    Apple and Pimento Salad    Gelatine Dessert      Cream of Vegetable Soup    Lima Bean Croquets    Creamed Potatoes    Carrots    Pickled Beets    Cornmeal and Rye Muffins    Cottage Pudding      Cream of Celery Soup    Rye Bread    Spinach Loaf    Cabbage and Pepper Relish    Brown Rice    Marmalade Pudding      Cream of Tomato Soup    Corn Sticks    Baked Macaroni and Cheese    Baked Sweet Potatoes    Eggplant    Beet and Cabbage Relish    Whole Wheat Bread    Apricot Shortcake    Hard Sauce          Of our men we ask their lives; Of ourselves, a little less food.          SAVE AND SERVE      TO SAVE BREAD. Serve bread or rolls made from corn, rye or from coarse  flours. Use breakfast foods and hot cakes, composed of corn, oatmeal,  buckwheat, rice or hominy. Serve no toast as garniture or under meat.  Serve war breads. Use every part of the bread, either fresh or stale,  for puddings and toast; or dried and sifted for baked croquettes; or  use to extend flour in the making of muffins and drop cakes.    TO SAVE MEAT. Use more chicken, hare, rabbits, duck, goose, lobster,  oysters, clams and egg and cheese dishes of all kinds. Use less beef,  mutton, and pork and serve smaller portions at table of these meats.  Have fewer of these items on the menu. Provide more entrees and  made-over dishes in which a smaller quantity of meat is extended by  the use of potatoes, rice, hominy, etc. Use beans, as they contain  nearly the same nutritive value as meat. Serve bacon only as a dish  and not as a garniture, and this way not more than once a week. Use  cheese, dried vegetables and nuts. Use fish and meat chowders. Use  meat extension dishes. Serve vegetable dinners.    TO SAVE SUGAR. Use less candy and sweet drinks. Use honey, maple  sugar, corn syrup, molasses and dark syrups with hot cakes and waffles  and in all cooking, in order to save butter and sugar. Use all classes  of fruit preserves, jam, marmalades and jellies. Do not frost or ice  cakes. Serve dried fruits with cereals, and no sugar is needed.    TO SAVE FATS. Serve as few fried dishes as possible, so as to  save both butter and lard, and in any event use vegetable oils for  frying--that is, olive oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, vegetable oil  compounds, etc. Trim all coarse fats from meats before cooking and use  the waste fats for shortening and for soap. We are short of soap fats  as our supplies of tropical oils used for soap-making are reduced. Do  not waste soap. Save fat from soup stock and from boiled meats. Use  butter substitutes where possible.    TO SAVE MILK. Use it all. Buy whole milk and let cream rise. Use this  cream, and you secure your milk without cost. Economize on milk and  cream except for children. Serve buttermilk. Serve cottage cheese  regularly in varying forms. It is especially nutritious. Use skimmed  milk in cooking. A great quantity of it goes to waste in this country.  Use cheese generally. The children must have milk whole, therefore  reduce the use of cream.    USE VEGETABLES. Use more vegetables and potatoes. Make fruits and  vegetables into salads and attractive dishes. Feature vegetable  dinners and salads of all kinds. Encourage the use of cheese with  salads. Make all types of salads from vegetables. We have a great  surplus of vegetables, and they can be used by substituting them for  staples so that the staples most needed will be saved.    Make all kinds of vegetable soups, especially the cream soups, in  which the waste from staple vegetables, such as outer leaves and  wilted parts, can be utilized. These are wholesome and nutritious and  save meat."]]]
