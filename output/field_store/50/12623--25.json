And Allah heareth and knoweth  all things.    P: There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth  distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth  in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is  Hearer, Knower.    S: There is no compulsion in religion; truly the right way has become  clearly distinct from error; therefore, whoever disbelieves in the  Shaitan and believes in Allah he indeed has laid hold on the firmest  handle, which shall not break off, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.    002.257  Y: Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of  darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith  the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth  into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the fire, to  dwell therein (For ever).    P: Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe. He bringeth  them out of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their  patrons are false deities. They bring them out of light into darkness.  Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein.    S: Allah is the guardian of those who believe. He brings them out of the  darkness into the light; and (as to) those who disbelieve, their  guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the  darkness; they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.    002.258  Y: Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham  About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: \"My  Lord is He Who giveth life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and  death\". Said Abraham: \"But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise  from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.\" Thus was  he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give  guidance to a people unjust.    P: Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord,  because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My  Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life  and cause death. Abraham said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the  East, so do thou cause it to come up from the West. Thus was the  disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.    S: Have you not considered him (Namrud) who disputed with Ibrahim about  his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said:  My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life  and cause death. Ibrahim said: So surely Allah causes the sun to rise  from the east, then make it rise from the west; thus he who disbelieved  was confounded; and Allah does not guide aright the unjust people.    002.259  Y: Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins  to its roofs. He said: \"Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life,  after (this) its death?\" but Allah caused him to die for a hundred  years, then raised him up (again). He said: \"How long didst thou tarry  (thus)?\" He said: \"(Perhaps) a day or part of a day.\" He said: \"Nay,  thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy  drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We  may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at the bones, how  We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.\" When this was shown  clearly to him, he said: \"I know that Allah hath power over all  things.\"    P: Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township which  had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this  township life after its death? And Allah made him die a hundred years,  then brought him back to life. He said: How long hast thou tarried?  (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a day. (He) said: Nay,  but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food and  drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make  thee a token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and  then cover them with flesh! And when (the matter) became clear unto  him, he said: I know now that Allah is Able to do all things.    S: Or the like of him (Uzair) who passed by a town, and it had fallen  down upon its roofs; he said: When will Allah give it life after its  death? So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him  to life. He said: How long have you tarried? He said: I have tarried a  day, or a part of a day. Said He: Nay! you have tarried a hundred  years; then look at your food and drink-- years have not passed over  it; and look at your ass; and that We may make you a sign to men, and  look at the bones, how We set them together, then clothed them with  flesh; so when it became clear to him, he said: I know that Allah has  power over all things.    002.260  Y: When Abraham said: \"Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead,\" He  replied: \"Have you no faith?\" He said \"Yes, but just to reassure my  heart.\" Allah said, \"Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their  bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them  back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.\"    P: And when Abraham said (unto his Lord): My Lord! Show me how Thou  givest life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe? Abraham said:  Yea, but (I ask) in order that my heart may be at ease. (His Lord)  said: Take four of the birds and cause them to incline unto thee, then  place a part of them on each hill, then call them, they will come to  thee in haste, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.    S: And when Ibrahim said: My Lord! show me how Thou givest life to the  dead, He said: What! and do you not believe? He said: Yes, but that my  heart may be at ease. He said: Then take four of the birds, then train  them to follow you, then place on every mountain a part of them, then  call them, they will come to you flying; and know that Allah is Mighty,  Wise.    002.261  Y: The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of Allah is  that of a grain of corn: it groweth seven ears, and each ear Hath a  hundred grains. Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth: And  Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.    P: The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way is as the  likeness of a grain which groweth seven ears, in every ear a hundred  grains. Allah giveth increase manifold to whom He will. Allah is  All-Embracing, All-Knowing.    S: The parable of those who spend their property in the way of Allah is  as the parable of a grain growing seven ears (with) a hundred grains in  every ear; and Allah multiplies for whom He pleases; and Allah is  Ample-giving, Knowing.    002.262  Y: Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah, and follow not  up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury,-for  them their reward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor  shall they grieve.    P: Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward  make not reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent;  their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon  them, neither shall they grieve.    S: (As for) those who spend their property in the way of Allah, then do  not follow up what they have spent with reproach or injury, they shall  have their reward from their Lord, and they shall have no fear nor  shall they grieve.    002.263  Y: Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity  followed by injury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is  Most-Forbearing.    P: A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by  injury. Allah is Absolute, Clement.    S: Kind speech and forgiveness is better than charity followed by  injury; and Allah is Self-sufficient, Forbearing.    002.264  Y: O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your  generosity or by injury,- like those who spend their substance to be  seen of men, but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are  in parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it  falls heavy rain, which leaves it (Just) a bare stone. They will be  able to do nothing with aught they have earned. And Allah guideth not  those who reject faith.    P: O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and  injury, like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and  believeth not in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is as the  likeness of a rock whereon is dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it,  leaving it smooth and bare. They have no control of aught of that which  they have gained. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.    S: O you who believe! do not make your charity worthless by reproach and  injury, like him who spends his property to be seen of men and does not  believe in Allah and the last day; so his parable is as the parable of  a smooth rock with earth upon it, then a heavy rain falls upon it, so  it leaves it bare; they shall not be able to gain anything of what they  have earned; and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.    002.265  Y: And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to  please Allah and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and  fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of  harvest, and if it receives not Heavy rain, light moisture sufficeth  it. Allah seeth well whatever ye do.    P: And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah's  pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#19)"],[1,"solved.    Among the many strangers who rushed into indiscriminate friendship with our  hero at Laverick Wells, was Mr. Jawleyford, of Jawleyford Court, in  ----shire. Jawleyford was a great humbug. He was a fine, off-hand,  open-hearted, cheery sort of fellow, who was always delighted to see you,  would start at the view, and stand with open arms in the middle of the  street, as though quite overjoyed at the meeting. Though he never gave  dinners, nor anything where he was, he asked everybody, at least everybody  who did give them, to visit him at Jawleyford Court. If a man was fond of  fishing, he must come to Jawleyford Court, he must, indeed; he would take  no refusal, he wouldn't leave him alone till he promised. He would show him  such fishing--no waters in the world to compare with his. The Shannon and  the Tweed were not to be spoken of in the same day as his waters in the  Swiftley.    Shooting, the same way. 'By Jove! are you a shooter? Well, I'm delighted to  hear it. Well, now, we shall be at home all September, and up to the middle  of October, and you must just come to us at your own time, and I will give  you some of the finest partridge and pheasant shooting you ever saw in your  life; Norfolk can show nothing to what I can. Now, my good fellow, say the  word; _do_ say you'll come, and then it will be a settled thing, and I  shall look forward to it with such pleasure!'    He was equally magnanimous about hunting, though, like a good many people  who have 'had their hunts,' he pretended that his day was over, though he  was a most zealous promoter of the sport. So he asked everybody who did  hunt to come and see him; and what with his hearty, affable manner, and the  unlimited nature of his invitations, he generally passed for a deuced  hospitable, good sort of fellow, and came in for no end of dinners and  other entertainments for his wife and daughters, of which he had  two--daughters, we mean, not wives. His time was about up at Laverick Wells  when Mr. Sponge arrived there; nevertheless, during the few days that  remained to them, Mr. Jawleyford contrived to scrape a pretty intimate  acquaintance with a gentleman whose wealth was reported to equal, if it did  not exceed, that of Mr. Waffles himself. The following was the closing  scene between them:    [Illustration: Jawleyford of Jawleyford Court]    'Mr. Sponge,' said he, getting our hero by both hands in Culeyford's  Billiard Room, and shaking them as though he could not bear the idea of  separation; 'my dear Mr. Sponge,' added he, 'I grieve to say we're going  to-morrow; I had hoped to have stayed a little longer, and to have enjoyed  the pleasure of your most agreeable society.' (This was true; he would have  stayed, only his banker wouldn't let him have any more money.) 'But,  however, I won't say adieu,' continued he; 'no, I _won't_ say adieu! I  live, as you perhaps know, in one of the best hunting countries in  England--my Lord Scamperdale's--Scamperdale and I are like brothers; I can  do whatever I like with him--he has, I may say, the finest pack of hounds  in the world; his huntsman, Jack Frostyface, I really believe, cannot be  surpassed. Come, then, my dear fellow,' continued Mr. Jawleyford,  increasing the grasp and shake of the hands, and looking most earnestly in  Sponge's face, as if deprecating a refusal; 'come, then, my dear fellow,  and see us; we will do whatever we can to entertain and make you  comfortable. Scamperdale shall keep our side of the country till you come;  there are capital stables at Lucksford, close to the station, and you shall  have a stall for your hack at Jawleyford, and a man to look after him, if  you like; so now, don't say nay--your time shall be ours--we shall be at  home all the rest of the winter, and I flatter myself, if you once come  down, you will be inclined to repeat your visit; at least, I hope so.'    There are two common sayings; one, 'that birds of a feather flock  together'; the other, 'that two of a trade never agree'; which often seem  to us to contradict each other in the actual intercourse of life. Humbugs  certainly have the knack of drawing together, and yet they are always  excellent friends, and will vouch for the goodness of each other in a way  that few straight-forward men think it worth their while to adopt with  regard to indifferent people. Indeed, humbugs are not always content to  defend their absent brother humbugs when they hear them abused, but they  will frequently lug each other in neck and crop, apparently for no other  purpose than that of proclaiming what excellent fellows they are, and see  if anybody will take up the cudgels against them.    Mr. Sponge, albeit with a considerable cross of the humbug himself, and one  who perfectly understood the usual worthlessness of general invitations,  was yet so taken with Mr. Jawleyford's hail-fellow-well-met, earnest sort  of manner, that, adopting the convenient and familiar solution in such  matters, that there is no rule without an exception, concluded that Mr.  Jawleyford was the exception, and really meant what he said.    Independently of the attractions offered by hunting, which were both strong  and cogent, we have said there were two young ladies, to whom fame attached  the enormous fortunes common in cases where there is a large property and  no sons. Still Sponge was a wary bird, and his experience of the  worthlessness of most general invitations made him think it just possible  that it might not suit Mr. Jawleyford to receive him now, at the particular  time he wanted to go; so after duly considering the case, and also the  impressive nature of the invitation, so recently given, too, he determined  not to give Jawleyford the chance of refusing him, but just to say he was  coming, and drop down upon him before he could say 'no.' Accordingly, he  penned the following epistle:        'BANTAM HOTEL, BOND-STREET, LONDON.        'DEAR JAWLEYFORD,    'I purpose being with you to-morrow, by the express train, which I see, by  Bradshaw, arrives at Lucksford a quarter to three. I shall only bring two  hunters and a hack, so perhaps you could oblige me by taking them in for  the short time I shall stay, as it would not be convenient for me to  separate them. Hoping to find Mrs. Jawleyford and the young ladies well, I  remain, dear sir,'        'Yours very truly,        'H. SPONGE.        'To--JAWLEYFORD, Esq., Jawleyford Court, Lucksford.'    'Curse the fellow!' exclaimed Jawleyford, nearly choking himself with a  fish bone, as he opened and read the foregoing at breakfast. 'Curse the  fellow!' he repeated, stamping the letter under foot, as though he would  crush it to atoms. 'Who ever saw such a piece of impudence as that!'    'What's the matter, my dear?' inquired Mrs. Jawleyford, alarmed lest it was  her dunning jeweller writing again.    'Matter!' shrieked Jawleyford, in a tone that sounded through the thick  wall of the room, and caused the hobbling old gardener on the terrace to  peep in at the heavy-mullioned window. 'Matter!' repeated he, as though he  had got his _coup de grace_; 'look there,' added he, handing over the  letter.    'Oh, my dear,' rejoined Mrs. Jawleyford soothingly, as soon as she saw it  was not what she expected. 'Oh, my dear, I'm sure there's nothing to make  you put yourself so much out of the way.' 'No!' roared Jawleyford,  determined not to be done out of his grievance. 'No!' repeated he; 'do you  call that nothing?'    'Why, nothing to make yourself unhappy about,' replied Mrs. Jawleyford,  rather pleased than otherwise; for she was glad it was not from Rings, the  jeweller, and, moreover, hated the monotony of Jawleyford Court, and was  glad of anything to relieve it. If she had had her own way, she would have  gadded about at watering-places all the year round.    'Well,' said Jawleyford, with a toss of the head and a shrug of  resignation, 'you'll have me in gaol; I see that.'    'Nay, my dear J.,' rejoined his wife, soothingly; 'I'm sure you've plenty  of money.'    'Have I!' ejaculated Jawleyford. 'Do you suppose, if I had, I'd have left  Laverick Wells without paying Miss Bustlebey, or given a bill at three  months for the house-rent?'    'Well, but, my dear, you've nothing to do but tell Mr. Screwemtight to get  you some money from the tenants.'    'Money from the tenants!' replied Mr. Jawleyford. 'Screwemtight tells me he  can't get another farthing from any man on the estate.'    'Oh, pooh!' said Mrs. Jawleyford; 'you're far too good to them. I always  say Screwemtight looks far more to their interest than he does to yours.'    [Illustration]    Jawleyford, we may observe, was one of the rather numerous race of  paper-booted, pen-and-ink landowners. He always dressed in the country as  he would in St. James's Street, and his communications with his tenantry  were chiefly confined to dining with them twice a year in the great  entrance-hall, after Mr. Screwemtight had eased them of their cash in the  steward's room. Then Mr. Jawleyford would shine forth the very  impersonification of what a landlord ought to be. Dressed in the height of  the fashion, as if by his clothes to give the lie to his words, he would  expatiate on the delights of such meetings of equality; declare that, next  to those spent with his family, the only really happy moments of his life  were those when he was surrounded by his tenantry; he doated on the manly  character of the English farmer. Then he would advert to the great  antiquity of the Jawleyford family, many generations of whom looked down  upon them from the walls of the old hall; some on their war-steeds, some  armed _cap-a-pie_, some in court-dresses, some in Spanish ones, one in a  white dress with gold brocade breeches and a hat with an enormous plume,  old Jawleyford (father of the present one) in the Windsor uniform, and our  friend himself, the very prototype of what then stood before them. Indeed,  he had been painted in"]]]
