Bring in the  moonshee.\"    From that moment, the little man had his permanent post in a corner of  the boys' room; and, when they were not on duty, they were constantly  engaged in studying the language, writing down the names of every  object they came across and getting it by heart, and learning every  sentence, question, and answer which occurred to them as likely to be  useful.    As for Tim, he quite lost patience at this devotion to study on the  part of his master; who, he declared to his comrades, went on just as  if he intended to become a nigger and a hathen himself.    \"It's just awful to hear him, Corporal M'Bean, jabbering away in that  foreign talk, with that little black monkey moonshine. The little  cratur a-twisting his shrivelled fingers about, that looks as if the  bones were coming through the skin. I wonder what the good father at  Blarney, where I come from, you know, Corporal, would say to sich  goings on. Faith, then, and if he were here, I'd buy a bottle of holy  water, and sprinkle it over the little hathen. I suspict he'd fly  straight up the chimney, when it touched him.\"    \"My opinion of you, Tim Kelly,\" the corporal, who was a grave  Scotchman, said; \"is that you're just a fule. Your master is a brave  young gentleman, and is a deal more sensible than most of them, who  spend all their time in drinking wine and playing cards. A knowledge  of the language is most useful. What would you do, yourself, if you  were to marry a native woman, and couldn't speak to her afterwards.\"    \"The saints defind us!\" Tim exclaimed; \"and what put such an idea in  yer head, Corporal? It's nayther more nor less than an insult to  suppose that I, a dacent boy, and brought up under the teaching of  Father O'Shea, should marry a hathen black woman; and if you weren't  my suparior officer, corporal, I'd tach ye better manners.\"    Fortunately, at this moment Charlie's voice was heard, shouting for  his servant; and Tim was therefore saved from the breach of the peace,  which his indignation showed that he meditated.    December passed quietly; and then, in January, 1752, an insurrection  planned by Dupleix broke out. The governor of Pondicherry had been  suffering keenly from disappointments; which, as time went on, and his  entreaties and commands to Law to attack Trichinopoli were answered  only by excuses and reasons for delay, grew to despair; and he  resolved upon making another effort to occupy the attention of the man  in whom he already recognized a great rival, and to prevent his taking  steps for the relief of Trichinopoli. Law had over and over again  assured him that, in the course of a very few weeks, that place would  be driven by famine to surrender; and, as soon as Clive arrived at  Fort Saint David, Dupleix set about taking steps which would again  necessitate his return to the north, and so give to Law the time which  he asked for.    Supplies of money were sent to Riza Sahib, together with four hundred  French soldiers. These marched suddenly upon Punemalli and captured  it, seized again the fortified temple of Conjeveram, and from this  point threatened both Madras and Arcot.    Had this force possessed an active and determined commander, it could  undoubtedly have carried out Dupleix's instructions, captured Madras,  and inflicted a terrible blow upon the English. Fortunately, it had no  such head. It marched indeed against Madras, plundered and burnt the  factories, levied contributions, and obtained possession of everything  but the fort; where the civilians, and the few men who constituted the  garrison, daily expected to be attacked, in which case the place must  have fallen. This, however, the enemy never even attempted, contenting  themselves with ravaging the place outside the walls of the fort.    The little garrison of Arcot, two hundred men in all, were astonished  at the news; that the province, which they had thought completely  conquered, was again in flames; that the road to Madras was cut, by  the occupation of Conjeveram by the French; and that Madras itself  was, save the fort, in the hands of the enemy. The fort itself, they  knew, might easily be taken, as they were aware that it was defended  by only eighty men.    The change in the position was at once manifest, in the altered  attitude of the fickle population. The main body of the inhabitants of  Southern India were Hindoos, who had for centuries been ruled by  foreign masters. The Mohammedans from the north had been their  conquerors, and the countless wars which had taken place, to them  signified merely whether one family or another were to reign over  them. The sole desire was for peace and protection; and they,  therefore, ever inclined towards the side which seemed strongest.  Their sympathies were no stronger with their Mohammedan rulers than  with the French or English, and they only hoped that whatever power  was strongest might conquer; and that, after the hostilities were  over, their daily work might be conducted in peace, and their property  and possessions be enjoyed in security. The capture and defence of  Arcot, and the battle of Arni, had brought them to regard the English  as their final victors; and the signs of deep and even servile  respect, which greeted the conquerors wherever they went, and which  absolutely disgusted Charlie Marryat and his friend, were really  sincere marks of the welcome to masters who seemed able and willing to  maintain their rule over them.    With the news of the successes of Riza Sahib, all this changed. The  natives no longer bent to the ground, as the English passed them in  the streets. The country people, who had flocked in with their  products to the markets, absented themselves altogether, and the whole  population prepared to welcome the French as their new masters.    In the fort, the utmost vigilance was observed. The garrison laboured  to mend the breaches, and complete the preparations for defence.  Provisions were again stored up, and they awaited anxiously news from  Clive.    That enterprising officer was at Fort Saint David, busy in making his  preparations for a decisive campaign against the enemy round  Trichinopoli, when the news of the rising reached him. He was  expecting a considerable number of fresh troops from England, as it  was in January that the majority of the reinforcements despatched by  the Company arrived in India; and Mr. Saunders had written to  Calcutta, begging that a hundred men might be sent thence. These were  now, with the eighty men at Madras, and the two hundred at Arcot, all  the force that could be at his disposal, for at Fort Saint David there  was not a single available man.    With all the efforts that Clive, aided by the authorities, could make,  it was not until the middle of February that he had completed his  arrangements. On the 9th, the hundred men arrived from Bengal, and,  without the loss of a day, Clive started from Madras to form a  junction with the garrison from Arcot, who, leaving only a small force  to hold the fort, had moved down to meet him.        Chapter 9: The Battle Of Kavaripak.      The troops from Arcot had already moved some distance on their way to  Madras, and Clive, therefore, with the new levies, joined them on the  day after his leaving Madras. The French and Riza Sahib let slip the  opportunity of attacking these bodies, before they united. They were  well aware of their movements, and had resolved upon tactics,  calculated in the first place to puzzle the English commander, to wear  out his troops, and to enable them finally to surprise and take him  entirely at a disadvantage.    The junction with the Arcot garrison raised the force under Clive's  orders to three hundred and eighty English, thirteen hundred Sepoys,  and six field guns, while the enemy at Vendalur, a place twenty-five  miles south of Madras, where they had a fortified camp, had four  hundred French troops, two thousand Sepoys, two thousand five hundred  cavalry, and twelve guns.    Hoping to surprise them there, Clive marched all night. When the force  approached the town they heard that the enemy had disappeared, and  that they had started, apparently, in several directions.    The force was halted for a few hours, and then the news was obtained  that the enemy had united their forces at Conjeveram, and that they  had marched away from that place in a westerly direction. Doubting not  that they were about to attack Arcot, which, weakened by the departure  of the greater portion of its garrison, would be in no position to  defend itself against a sudden coup de main by a strong force, Clive  set his troops again in motion. The French, indeed, had already bribed  some of the native soldiers within the fort; who were to reply to a  signal made without, if they were in a position to open the gates.  However, by good fortune their treachery had been discovered, and when  the French arrived they received no reply to their signal; and as  Arcot would be sure to fall if they defeated Clive, they marched away  without attacking it, to take up the position which they had agreed  upon beforehand.    It was at nine in the evening that Clive, at Vendalur, obtained  intelligence that the enemy had assembled at Conjeveram. The troops  had already marched twenty-five miles, but they had had a rest of five  hours, and Clive started with them at once, and reached Conjeveram,  twenty miles distant, at four in the morning. Finding that the enemy  had again disappeared, he ordered the troops to halt for a few hours.  They had already marched forty-five miles in twenty-four hours, a  great feat when it is remembered that only the Arcot garrison were in  any way accustomed to fatigue, the others being newly raised levies.  The greater portion of the Sepoys had been enlisted within the  fortnight preceding.    \"I don't know, Mr. Marryat, whether the French call this fighting.

Vtrisque ad animum occurrit unum esse illud  tempus, quo maxime contendi conveniat: Galli, nisi perfregerint  munitiones, de omni salute desperant; Romani, si rem obtinuerint, finem  laborum omnium exspectant. Maxime ad superiores munitiones laboratur,  quo Vercassivellaunum missum demonstravimus. Iniquum loci ad  declivitatem fastigium magnum habet momentum. Alii tela coniciunt, alii  testudine facta subeunt; defatigatis in vicem integri succedunt. Agger  ab universis in munitionem coniectus et ascensum dat Gallis et ea quae  in terra occultaverant Romani contegit; nec iam arma nostris nec vires  suppetunt.      86    His rebus cognitis Caesar Labienum cum cohortibus sex subsidio  laborantibus mittit: imperat, si sustinere non posset, deductis  cohortibus eruptione pugnaret; id nisi necessario ne faciat. Ipse adit  reliquos, cohortatur ne labori succumbant; omnium superiorum  dimicationum fructum in eo die atque hora docet consistere. Interiores  desperatis campestribus locis propter magnitudinem munitionum loca  praerupta ex ascensu temptant: huc ea quae paraverant conferunt.  Multitudine telorum ex turribus propugnantes deturbant, aggere et  cratibus fossas explent, falcibus vallum ac loricam rescindunt.      87    Mittit primo Brutum adulescentem cum cohortibus Caesar, post cum aliis  Gaium Fabium legatum; postremo ipse, cum vehementius pugnaretur,  integros subsidio adducit. Restituto proelio ac repulsis hostibus eo quo  Labienum miserat contendit; cohortes quattuor ex proximo castello  deducit, equitum partem sequi, partem circumire exteriores munitiones et  ab tergo hostes adoriri iubet. Labienus, postquam neque aggeres neque  fossae vim hostium sustinere poterant, coactis una XL cohortibus, quas  ex proximis praesidus deductas fors obtulit, Caesarem per nuntios facit  certiorem quid faciendum existimet. Accelerat Caesar, ut proelio  intersit.      88    Eius adventu ex colore vestitus cognito, quo insigni in proeliis uti  consuerat, turmisque equitum et cohortibus visis quas se sequi iusserat,  ut de locis superioribus haec declivia et devexa cernebantur, hostes  proelium committunt. Vtrimque clamore sublato excipit rursus ex vallo  atque omnibus munitionibus clamor. Nostri omissis pilis gladiis rem  gerunt. Repente post tergum equitatus cernitur; cohortes aliae  appropinquant. Hostes terga vertunt; fugientibus equites occurrunt. Fit  magna caedes. Sedulius, dux et princeps Lemovicum, occiditur;  Vercassivellaunus Arvernus vivus in fuga comprehenditur; signa militaria  septuaginta quattuor ad Caesarem referuntur: pauci ex tanto numero se  incolumes in castra recipiunt. Conspicati ex oppido caedem et fugam  suorum desperata salute copias a munitionibus reducunt. Fit protinus hac  re audita ex castris Gallorum fuga. Quod nisi crebris subsidiis ac  totius diei labore milites essent defessi, omnes hostium copiae deleri  potuissent. De media nocte missus equitatus novissimum agmen  consequitur: magnus numerus capitur atque interficitur; reliqui ex fuga  in civitates discedunt.      89    Postero die Vercingetorix concilio convocato id bellum se suscepisse non  suarum necessitatium, sed communis libertatis causa demonstrat, et  quoniam sit fortunae cedendum, ad utramque rem se illis offerre, seu  morte sua Romanis satisfacere seu vivum tradere velint. Mittuntur de his  rebus ad Caesarem legati. Iubet arma tradi, principes produci. Ipse in  munitione pro castris consedit: eo duces producuntur; Vercingetorix  deditur, arma proiciuntur. Reservatis Aeduis atque Arvernis, si per eos  civitates reciperare posset, ex reliquis captivis toto exercitui capita  singula praedae nomine distribuit.      90    His rebus confectis in Aeduos proficiscitur; civitatem recipit.

Titum Labienum duabus cum  legionibus et equitatu in Sequanos proficisci iubet: huic Marcum  Sempronium Rutilum attribuit. Gaium Fabium legatum et Lucium Minucium  Basilum cum legionibus duabus in Remis collocat, ne quam ab finitimis  Bellovacis calamitatem accipiant. Gaium Antistium Reginum in  Ambivaretos, Titum Sextium in Bituriges, Gaium Caninium Rebilum in  Rutenos cum singulis legionibus mittit.

His  litteris cognitis Romae dierum viginti supplicatio redditur.      Liber VIII    Aulus Hirtius    post 52    Prooemium I    Coactus assiduis tuis vocibus, Balbe, cum cotidiana mea recusatio non  difficultatis excusationem, sed inertiae videretur deprecationem habere,  rem difficillimam suscepi. Caesaris nostri commentarios rerum gestarum  Galliae, non comparantibus superioribus atque insequentibus eius  scriptis, contexui novissimumque imperfectum ab rebus gestis Alexandriae  confeci usque ad exitum non quidem civilis dissensionis, cuius finem  nullum videmus, sed vitae Caesaris. Quos utinam qui legent scire possint  quam invitus susceperim scribendos, qua facilius caream stultitiae atque  arrogantiae crimine, qui me mediis interposuerim Caesaris scriptis.  Constat enim inter omnes nihil tam operose ab aliis esse perfectum, quod  non horum elegantia commentariorum superetur: qui sunt editi, ne  scientia tantarum rerum scriptoribus deesset, adeoque probantur omnium  iudicio ut praerepta, non praebita, facultas scriptoribus videatur.  Cuius tamen rei maior nostra quam reliquorum est admiratio: ceteri enim,  quam bene atque emendate, nos etiam, quam facile atque celeriter eos  perfecerit scimus. Erat autem in Caesare cum facultas atque elegantia  summa scribendi, tum verissima scientia suorum consiliorum  explicandorum. Mihi ne illud quidem accidit, ut Alexandrino atque  Africano bello interessem; quae bella quamquam ex parte nobis Caesaris  sermone sunt nota, tamen aliter audimus ea, quae rerum novitate aut  admiratione nos capiunt, aliter, quae pro testimonio sumus dicturi. Sed  ego nimirum, dum omnes excusationis causas colligo ne cum Caesare  conferar, hoc ipsum crimen arrogantiae subeo, quod me iudicio cuiusquam  existimem posse cum Caesare comparari. Vale.      1    Omni Gallia devicta Caesar cum a superiore aestate nullum bellandi  tempus intermisisset militesque hibernorum quiete reficere a tantis  laboribus vellet, complures eodem tempore civitates renovare belli  consilia nuntiabantur coniurationesque facere. Cuius rei verisimilis  causa adferebatur, quod Gallis omnibus cogrutum esset neque ulla  multitudine in unum locum coacta resisti posse Romanis, nec, si diversa  bella complures eodem tempore intulissent civitates, satis auxili aut  spati aut copiarum habiturum exercitum populi Romani ad omnia  persequenda; non esse autem alicui civitati sortem incommodi recusandam,  si tali mora reliquae possent se vindicare in libertatem.      2    Quae ne opinio Gallorum confirmaretur, Caesar Marcum Antonium quaestorem  suis praefecit hibernis; ipse equitum praesidio pridie Kal. Ianuarias ab  oppido Bibracte proficiscitur ad legionem XIII, quam non longe a finibus  Aeduorum collocaverat in finibus Biturigum, eique adiungit legionem XI,  quae proxima fuerat. Binis cohortibus ad impedimenta tuenda relictis  reliquum exercitum in copiosissimos agros Biturigum inducit, qui, cum  latos fines et complura oppida haberent, unius legionis hibernis non  potuerint contineri quin bellum pararent coniurationesque facerent.      3    Repentino adventu Caesaris accidit, quod imparatis disiectisque accidere  fuit necesse, ut sine timore ullo rura colentes prius ab equitatu  opprimerentur quam confugere in oppida possent. Namque etiam illud  vulgare incursionis hostium signum, quod incendiis aedificiorum  intellegi consuevit, Caesaris erat interdicto sublatum, ne aut copia  pabuli frumentique, si longius progredi vellet, deficeretur, aut hostes  incendius terrerentur. Multis hominum milibus captis perterriti  Bituriges; qui primum adventum potuerant effugere Romanorum, in  finitimas civitates aut privatis hospitiis confisi aut societate  consiliorum confugerant. Frustra: nam Caesar magni sitineribus omnibus  locis occurrit nec dat ulli civitati spatium de aliena potius quam de  domestica salute cogitandi; qua celeritate et fideles amicos retinebat  et dubitantes terrore ad condiciones pacis adducebat. Tali condicione  proposita Bituriges, cum sibi viderent clementia Caesaris reditum patere  in eius amicitiam finitimasque civitates sine ulla poena dedisse obsides  atque in fidem receptas esse, idem fecerunt.      4    Caesar militibus pro tanto labore ac patientia, qui brumalibus diebus  itineribus difficillimis, frigoribus intolerandis studiosissime  permanserant in labore, ducenos sestertios, centurionibus tot milia  nummum praedae nomine condonanda pollicetur legionibusque in hiberna  remissis ipse se recipit die XXXX Bibracte. Ibi cum ius diceret,  Bituriges ad eum legatos mittunt auxilium petitum contra Carnutes, quos  intulisse bellum sibi querebantur. Qua re cognita, cum dies non amplius  decem et octo in hibernis esset moratus, legiones XIIII et VI ex  hibernis ab Arare educit, quas ibi collocatas explicandae rei  frumentariae causa superiore commentario demonstratum est: ita cum  duabus legionibus ad persequendos Carnutes proficiscitur.      5    Cum fama exercitus ad hostes esset perlata, calamitate ceterorum ducti  Carnutes desertis vicis oppidisque, quae tolerandae hiemis causa  constitutis repente exiguis ad necessitatem aedificiis incolebant (nuper  enim devicti complura oppida dimiserant), dispersi profugiunt. Caesar  erumpentes eo maxime tempore acerrimas tempestates cum subire milites  nollet, in oppido Carnutum Cenabo castra ponit atque in tecta partim  Gallorum, "]]]
