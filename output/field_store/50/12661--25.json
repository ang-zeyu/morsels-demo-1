Never leave  a bass string the slightest amount too sharp. As flatness is so  obnoxious in the treble, just so is sharpness in the bass, so if there  must be any variation in any bass tone let it be flat; but aim at  perfect octaves throughout the bass.    ~False Waves.~--We say \"false waves\" for want of a better name. You  will find a string occasionally that will give forth waves or beats so  similar to the real ones that it takes a practiced ear to distinguish  the difference. Where a unison contains a string of this kind, select  some other string by which to tune the interval, and leave the bad  string until the last; you may then find difficulty in being able to  tell when you have it in unison. The cause may be a twisted string, a  fault in the string by imperfect drawing of the wire, or in the  construction of the sound-board.    In the low bass tones, a kind of false waves are always present, and  will annoy the tuner long after he has been in regular practice. They  are, however, of a different nature from the true waves in that they  are of a metallic timbre and of much greater rapidity than the latter.  Close attention will generally enable the tuner to distinguish between  them. They are caused by what is known as \"harmonics\" or \"over-tones\";  the string vibrating in fractional segments.    False waves will occur in an annoying degree when the tuner sets a  mute on a nodal point in the string; it will cause the muted string to  sound a real harmonic tone. This does not happen in the upright, as  the mutes are set so near the end of the string as to preclude this  possibility. In the square, however, it very frequently happens, as  there are so many nodes between the dampers and the bridge, where the  tuner sets his mutes. If, for instance, he is tuning an octave and has  his mute set precisely in the middle of the vibrating segment, in  place of muting the string it sounds its own octave, which will  disturb the ear in listening for the tone from the one free string.  Move the mute either way until it is found to mute the string  entirely.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON XIV.        1. Explain the cause of the beats.        2. How many _beats_ per second in a unison of two strings, one      tuned to 100, the other to 101 vibrations per second?        3. How many beats per second in an octave, the lower tone of which      is tuned to 100, the upper to 201 vibrations per second?        4. How many beats per second in a fifth, the fundamental of which      is tuned to 100, the fifth to 151?        5. The fifth, 2F-3C, when properly tempered, should beat 1-3/4      times per second. How often should a fifth, an octave higher,      beat?          LESSON XV.    ~MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS PERTAINING TO THE PRACTICAL WORK OF TUNING,  REGULATING, AND REPAIRING.~      ~Comparison of the Different Systems.~--Up to this time, we have given  no account of any system of tuning except the one recommended. For the  purpose of making the student more thoroughly informed we detail here  several different systems which have been devised and practiced by  other tuners. It is a matter of history that artisans in this  profession and leaders in musical science have endeavored to devise a  system of temperament having all the desirable qualifications.    The aims of many have been to invent a system which uses the fewest  number of tones; working under the impression that the fewer the tones  used in the temperament, the easier the tuner's work. These have  reduced the compass of the temperament to the twelve semi-tones from  middle C to B above; or from F below, to E above middle C. This  system requires the tuner to make use of both fourths and fifths. Not  only does he have to use these two kinds of intervals in tuning, but  he has to tune by fourths up and fourths down, and, likewise, by  fifths up and fifths down. When tuning a fifth upward, he flattens it;  and when tuning a fifth downward he sharpens the lower tone; when  tuning a fourth upward, he sharpens it; when tuning a fourth downward,  he flattens the lower tone.    It is readily seen that by a system of this kind the tuner's mind is  constantly on a strain to know how to temper the interval he is  tuning, and how much to temper it, as fourths require a different  degree of tempering from the fifths; and he is constantly changing  from an interval upward to one downward; so, this system must be  stamped as tedious and complicated, to say the least. Yet this system  is much followed in factories for rough tuning, and also by many old  professional tuners.    The table on the following page gives the succession of intervals  generally taken by tuners employing this system using the tones within  the F octave mentioned above. Middle C is obtained in the usual way,  from the tuning fork.                                     SYSTEM A.        By middle C  tune F             fifth below.      Temper sharp.             By F    \"  B[b] (A[#]) fourth above.         \"     \"              \" C    \"  G             fourth below.       \"    flat              \" G    \"  D           fifth above.          \"     \"              \" D    \"  A             fourth below.       \"     \"              \" A    \"  E           fifth above.          \"     \"              \" E    \"  B             fourth below.       \"     \"              \" B    \"  F[#]          fourth below.       \"     \"              \" F[#] \"  C[#]        fifth above.          \"     \"              \" C[#] \"  G[#]          fourth below.       \"     \"              \" G[#] \"  D[#]        fifth above.          \"     \"      Then try D[#] with A[#] previously tuned for \"wolves.\"    We think a little study and trial of this system will produce the  conviction that it is a very difficult and precarious one, and that it  has every disadvantage but one, namely, that it uses the smallest  possible number of tones, which is really of little value, and does  not compensate for the difficulty encountered and the uncertainty of  the results.    Another system which has many advantages over the above, is one which  employs fifths only and covers a compass of an octave and a half. This  system is similar to ours in that it employs fifths in the same  succession as far as G[#], the most of them, however, being an octave  higher. From this G[#] there is a break in the succession, and the  tuner goes back to middle C from which he started and tunes by fifths  downward until he reaches the G[#] at which he left off. This system  employs the tones from F below middle C to C, octave above. Below is  the succession, starting upon 3C, whose pitch is determined as usual.                             SYSTEM B.        By 3C   tune 2C       octave below.      \"  2C    \"   2G    fifth above.      \"  2G    \"   1G       octave below.      \"  1G    \"   2D    fifth above.      \"  2D    \"   2A    fifth above.      \"  2A    \"   1A       octave below.      \"  1A    \"   2E    fifth above.      \"  2E    \"   2B    fifth above.      \"  2B    \"   1B       octave below.      \"  1B    \"   2F[#] fifth above.      \"  2F[#] \"   1F[#]    octave below.      \"  1F[#] \"   2C[#] fifth above.      \"  2C[#] \"   2G[#] fifth above.      \"  2G[#] \"   1G[#]    octave below.          By 2C   tune 1F    fifth below. Temper sharp.      \"  1F    \"   2F       octave above.      \"  2F    \"   1B[b] fifth below. Temper sharp.      \"  1B[b] \"   2B[b]    octave above.      \"  2B[b] \"   2E[b] fifth below. Temper sharp.        Now by 2E[b] try 1A[b] (G[#]) fifth below for the \"wolf.\"        Note that this last trial brings you back to the last tone tuned      before the break.    This system is used by a great number of very successful tuners, and  it has but one appreciable disadvantage, which is that involved in  changing from fifths upward to fifths downward. This difficulty is  easily overcome, if it were all there is to encounter; but in  practice, we find that after tuning the intervals in the above  succession down to the last step in the first series, middle C will  often have changed pitch somewhat, and the last five tones with their  octaves tuned from it will not be in true harmony with the intervals  tuned in the first series. For this reason it is better to go on  through, as in our system, tuning by fifths upward, and if there is  any change of pitch in the first tones tuned, they may be more easily  corrected by going over them in the same way as at the start; also,  the amount of difficulty in locating discrepancies is greatly  lessened.                                   SYSTEM C.    The following system is one that is followed by many good tuners of  the present day and has many advantages. To use this system  successfully, however, one must be familiar with the number of beats  necessary in each interval used.    Take 1F as a standard.    By 1F, tune 2C, fifth above.  By 1F, tune 1B[b], fourth above.  By 1F, tune 1A, major third above.  By 1F, tune 2D, sixth above.  By 1F, tune 1A[b], minor third above.  By 1F, tune 2F, octave above.  By 2C or 2D, tune 1G, fourth or fifth below.  By 1G, 1A or 2C, tune 2E, sixth, fifth or third above.  By 1G or 2E, tune 1B, third above or fourth below.  By 1A or A[#], tune 2C[#], major or minor third above.  By 1A[b], 1B[b] or 1B, tune 2E[b], fifth, fourth or major third above.  By 1B[b], 1B, 2C[#] or 2E[b], tune 1F[#], major third, fourth, fifth     or sixth below.    As each step is taken in this system, the tone tuned is tested with  any or all of the tones previously tuned.    You will notice that six tones are tuned by the first standard, F.  Therefore, if any error is left in any one of the intervals it exists  in this only and is not transmitted to other tones, if corrected  before such other tones are used to tune by.    The numerous tests possible, early in the system, and the small  compass used, one octave, may be said to be the chief advantages of  the system.    The intervals used are the minor and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#19)"],[1," in which the  government stood towards the various orders of society in the  all-influential capital. He abandoned the conduct of the diplomatic  business to his colleagues, and reached Paris at the beginning of  December. Nor was he without a feasible pretext for this rapidity. On  the 2nd of October, the Directory had announced to the French people  their purpose to carry the war with the English into England itself; the  immediate organisation of a great invading army; and their design to  place it under the command of \"Citizen General Buonaparte.\"    During his brief stay at Rastadt the dictator of Campo-Formio once more  broke out. The Swedish envoy was Count Fersen, the same nobleman who had  distinguished himself in Paris, during the early period of the  Revolution, by his devotion to King Louis and Marie-Antoinette.  Buonaparte refused peremptorily to enter into any negotiation in which a  man, so well known for his hostility to the cause of the Republic,  should have any part; and Fersen instantly withdrew.    On quitting this congress Napoleon was careful to resume, in every  particular, the appearance of a private citizen. Reaching Paris, he  took up his residence in the same small modest house that he had  occupied before he set out for Italy, in the _Rue Chantereine_, which,  about this time, in compliment to its illustrious inhabitant, received  from the municipality the new name of _Rue de la Victoire_. Here he  resumed with his plain clothes his favourite studies and pursuits, and,  apparently contented with the society of his private friends, seemed to  avoid, as carefully as others in his situation might have courted, the  honours of popular distinction and applause. It was not immediately  known that he was in Paris, and when he walked the streets his person  was rarely recognised by the multitude. His mode of life was necessarily  somewhat different from what it had been when he was both poor and  obscure; his society was courted in the highest circles, and he from  time to time appeared in them, and received company at home with the  elegance of hospitality over which Josephine was so well qualified to  preside. But policy as well as pride moved him to shun notoriety. Before  he could act again, he had much to observe; and he knew himself too well  to be flattered by the stare either of mobs or of saloons. \"They have  memories for nothing here\"--he said at this time to his secretary--\"if I  remain long without doing anything, I am done. Fame chases fame in this  great Babylon. If they had seen me three times at the spectacle, they  would no longer look at me.\" Another day Bourienne could not help  congratulating him on some noisy demonstration of popular favour. \"Bah!\"  he answered, \"they would rush as eagerly about me if I were on my way to  the scaffold.\"    In his intercourse with society at this period, he was, for the most  part, remarkable for the cold reserve of his manners. He had the  appearance of one too much occupied with serious designs, to be able to  relax at will into the easy play of ordinary conversation. If his eye  was on every man, he well knew that every man's eye was upon him; nor,  perhaps, could he have chosen a better method (had that been his sole  object) for prolonging and strengthening the impression his greatness  was calculated to create, than this very exhibition of indifference. He  did not suffer his person to be familiarised out of reverence. When he  did appear, it was not the ball or _bon mot_ of the evening before, that  he recalled:--he was still, wherever he went, the Buonaparte of Lodi,  and Arcola, and Rivoli. His military bluntness disdained to disguise  itself amidst those circles where a meaner _parvenu_ would have been  most ambitious to shine. The celebrated daughter of Necker made many  efforts to catch his fancy and enlist him among the votaries of her wit,  which then gave law in Paris. \"Whom,\" said she, half wearied with his  chillness, \"do you consider as the greatest of women?\" \"Her, madam,\" he  answered, \"who has borne the greatest number of children.\" From this  hour he had Madame de Stael for his enemy; and yet, such are the  inconsistencies of human nature, no man was more sensitive than he to  the assaults of a species of enemy whom he thus scorned to conciliate.  Throughout his Italian campaigns--as consul--as emperor--and down to the  last hour of the exile which terminated his life--Buonaparte suffered  himself to be annoyed by sarcasms and pamphlets as keenly and constantly  as if he had been a poetaster.    The haughtiness, for such it was considered, of his behaviour in the  society of the capital, was of a piece with what he had already  manifested in the camp. In the course of his first campaigns, his  officers, even of the highest rank, became sensible, by degrees, to a  total change of demeanour. An old acquaintance of the Toulon period,  joining the army, was about to throw himself into the general's arms  with the warmth of the former familiarity. Napoleon's cold eye checked  him; and he perceived in a moment how he had altered with his elevation.  He had always, on the other hand, affected much familiarity with the  common soldiery. He disdained not on occasion to share the ration or to  taste the flask of a sentinel; and the French private, often as  intelligent as those whom fortune has placed above him, used to address  the great general with even more frankness than his own captain.  Napoleon, in one of his Italian despatches, mentions to the Directory  the pleasure which he often derived from the conversation of the men:  \"But yesterday,\" says he, \"a common trooper addressed me as I was  riding, and told me he thought he could suggest the movement which ought  to be adopted. I listened to him, and heard him detail some operations  on which I had actually resolved but a little before.\" It has been  noticed (perhaps by over-nice speculators) as a part of the same  system, that Napoleon, on his return to Paris, continued to employ the  same tradespeople, however inferior in their several crafts, who had  served him in the days of his obscurity.[21]    If we may follow M. de Bourienne, Napoleon at this time laboured under  intense anxiety of mind. Conscious of the daring heights to which he had  ere now accustomed his ambitious imagination, he was fearful that others  had divined his secret, and was haunted with the perpetual dread that  some accident might unite Royalists and Republicans in the work of his  personal ruin.    The first public appearance of Buonaparte occurred (January 2, 1798)  when the treaty of Campo-Formio was to be formally presented to the  Directory. The great court of the Luxembourg was roofed over with flags;  an immense concourse, including all the members of the government and of  the two legislative bodies, expected the victorious negotiator; and when  he appeared, followed by his staff, and surrounded on all hands with the  trophies of his glorious campaign, the enthusiasm of the mighty  multitude, to the far greater part of which his person was, up to the  moment, entirely unknown, outleaped all bounds, and filled the already  jealous hearts of the directors with dark presentiments. They well knew  that the soldiery, returning from Italy, had sung and said through every  village that it was high time to get rid of the lawyers, and make the  \"little corporal\" king. With uneasy hearts did they hear what seemed too  like an echo of this cry, from the assembled leaders of opinion in Paris  and in France. Anxious curiosity and mutual distrust were written in  every face. The voice of Napoleon was for the first time heard in an  energetic speech, ascribing all the glories that had been achieved to  the zeal of the French soldiery--for \"the glorious constitution of the  year THREE\"--the same glorious constitution which, in the year _eight_,  was to receive the _coup de grace_ from his own hand; and Barras, as  presiding director, answering, that \"Nature had exhausted all her powers  in the creation of a Buonaparte,\" awoke a new thunder of unwelcome  applauses.    Carnot had been exiled after the 18th Fructidor, and was at this time  actually believed to be dead. The institute nominated Buonaparte to fill  his place; and he was received by this learned body with enthusiasm not  inferior to that of the Luxembourg. He thenceforth adopted, on all  public occasions, the costume of this academy; and, laying aside as far  as was possible, the insignia of his military rank, seemed to desire  only the distinction of being classed with those whose scientific  attainments had done honour to their country. In all this he acted on  calculation. \"I well knew,\" said he at St. Helena, \"that there was not a  drummer in the army, but would respect me the more for believing me to  be not a mere soldier.\"    Some time before he left Italy, a motion had been made in one of the  chambers for rewarding him with a grant of the estate of Chambord, and  lost owing solely to the jealousy of the Directory. This opposition was  on their part unjust and unwise, and extremely unpopular also; for it  was known to all men that the general might easily have enriched himself  during his wonderful campaigns, and it was almost as generally believed  that he had brought with him to the _Rue de la Victoire_ only 100,000  crowns, saved from the fair allowances of his rank. No one who considers  the long series of intrigues which had passed between Buonaparte and the  party that triumphed in Fructidor, can doubt how he regarded this part  of their conduct. Every day confirmed them in their jealousy; nor did he  take much pains on the other hand to conceal his feelings towards them.  On many occasions they were willing to make use of him, although they  dreaded in so doing to furnish him with new proofs of the vast  superiority which he had reached in public opinion above themselves; and  he was, on his part, chary of acceding to any "]]]
