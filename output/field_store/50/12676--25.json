By the time the thong struck the road we were brushing up  dense clouds of dust, singing, whistling, and roaring the words,  \"Britons never shall be slaves!\"    The dust screen saved us. It was so efficient that the furious guardian  with the whip had to beat a hurried retreat.    One morning we were paraded at six o'clock as usual. The adjutant,  another fierce-visaged Prussian, astride his horse, faced us. With  assumed majesty he roared out an order. The guards closed in. What was  going to happen now?    Amid a tense silence he shouted spluttering with rage:--    \"You damned English swine! Yes! You English dogs! You are the cause of  this war, and you will have to suffer for it. We could punish you  severely. But that is not the German way. We could make you work. But  the traditions of German honour forbid. Your Government has gouged out  the eyes of German prisoners who have had the misfortune to fall into  their hands. We don't propose to take those measures. While your  Government has stopped at nothing we are going to show you how Germany  fulfils the traditions of her honour, and respects the laws to which all  civilised nations have subscribed. But remember! We are going to bring  England to her knees. Aren't we, men?\"    \"Ja! Ja!\" (Yes! Yes!) came the wild singing reply from the excited  guards.          CHAPTER VII    BREAKING US IN AT SENNELAGER      No doubt the pompous adjutant plumed himself upon his tirade and the  impression it had created among the guards. But at the time it was as so  much Greek to us. We wondered what it all meant and what had prompted  his strange speech.    It was not until my return home that I was able to appreciate the  reason. But the bitterness with which he delivered his harangue  certainly proved that he believed the stories which had evidently been  sedulously circulated throughout Germany relative to the alleged  mal-treatment and torture of German military prisoners by the British.  Unfortunately, no steps apparently were taken to disprove these  deliberate lying statements for which we had to pay the penalty.    But I was not reassured by the Adjutant's honeyed words concerning the  example which Germany proposed to set to the British. I guessed that  something which would not redound to our welfare and comfort was in the  air. It is the German method to preach one thing and to practise  something diametrically opposite. I had already learned this. Nor was I  destined to be mistaken in my surmise.    A little later there was another parade. The officer roared,    \"All those who are engineers step out!\"    A number, including myself, although absolutely ignorant of the craft,  stepped out, because here was the opportunity to secure some form of  active employment.    \"You are engineers?\" he shouted.    We nodded assent.    \"Can you build a drain?\"    Again we nodded affirmatively.    We were marshalled, and one of us, Mr. C----, who was a civil engineer,  was selected as leader. We were marched off and set to work to dig a  drain for the camp.    We built that drain, but it was necessity's labour lost. We were not  provided with proper drain pipes but made an open conduit. We had to go  to the quarry to get the stone, which we broke into small pieces, and  these were set out in concave form at the bottom of the trench we had  excavated after the manner in which cobble stones are laid. I believe it  was considered to be an excellent piece of work, but unfortunately it  was of little use. The first wind and rain that came along dumped the  sand into it with the result that it became filled up.    A day or two later there was another parade. Once more the officer stood  before us with a long sheet of paper in his hand.    \"All those who can do wire-pulling stand out!\"    Those who knew about what he was talking advanced to form a little  group.    \"All those who are gardeners stand out!\"    More men advanced and another group resulted.    The officer went right through his list calling out a long string of  trades and callings. The result was our sub-division into a number of  small units, each capable of fulfilling some task. A sentry was  appointed to each group and we were hurried off to the particular toil  for which we considered ourselves to be fitted, and about which I will  say more later.    If the accommodation at the \"luxurious hotel\" was wretched the routine  and cuisine were worse. We were under military discipline as it is  practised in Prussia, and it was enforced with the utmost rigour. We  were not permitted to speak to an officer under any pretext whatever.  Any complaints or requests had to be carried to the authorities through  our \"Captain,\" who was also the officially recognised interpreter. If we  met an officer we were commanded to raise our hats.    [*gap]    The day started at 6.0 a.m., with parade. If we desired to have a wash  and shave we had to be astir an hour earlier because otherwise we were  not allowed to perform those essential duties until late in the evening.  After parade we had breakfast--a basin of lukewarm \"coffee\" made from  acorns roasted and ground, which we had to fetch, and with which neither  milk nor sugar was served.    At seven o'clock we started the day's work, which was continued without  respite until mid-day. At least that was the official order, but one or  two of the guards were far from being harsh towards us. In the middle of  the morning, as in our case, the warder, after a wary look round, would  ask if we would like to rest for ten minutes to snatch something to eat  if we had it. Needless to say the slight respite was greatly  appreciated. But it was by no means the general practice. One or two of  the sentries were so deeply incensed against England that they took the  opportunity to bait and badger the men in their charge without mercy.  They kept the prisoners under them going hard without a break or pause.    At noon we returned to barracks for dinner. Arming ourselves with our  basins we scrambled down to the cook-house for our rations. It was  red-cabbage soup, and it was never varied. But it was the strangest soup  I have ever seen made or tasted, more particularly during the early  days.    There was a big cauldron with boiling water. Alongside was a table on  which the cabbages were cut up. A handful of cabbage was picked up and  dumped into the cauldron. Directly it hit the water the cabbage was  considered to be cooked and was served out. Consequently the meal  comprised merely a basin of sloshy boiling water in which floated some  shreds of uncooked red cabbage. Sometimes the first batch of men  succeeded in finding the cabbage warmed through: it had been left in the  water for a few seconds. But the last batch invariably fared badly. The  cooks realising that there would be insufficient to go round forthwith  dumped in two or three buckets of cold water to eke it out. Sometimes,  but on very rare occasions, a little potato, and perhaps a bone which  had once been associated with meat, would be found in the basin lurking  under a piece of cabbage leaf. Ultimately some French and Belgians were  put in charge of the kitchen. Then there was a slight improvement. The  cabbage was generally well-cooked and the soup was hot. But although  these cooks did their best, it did not amount to much, for the simple  reason that the authorities would not permit any further ingredients  whatever.    At 2.0 p.m., there was another parade, followed by a return to work  which was continued without intermission for another four hours. At six  in the evening we returned to barracks for a third parade after which we  were dismissed for tea. This was another far from appetising meal,  merely constituting a repetition of the breakfast ration--a basin of  lukewarm acorn coffee without milk or sugar. In addition to the  foregoing we were served with a portion of a loaf of black bread on  alternate mornings. This supply, if you got it, had to last six meals.    It will be realised that our wardens were far from being disposed to  feed us up. We grumbled against the rations, their monotony and  insufficiency, but we received no amelioration of our condition. In  fact, our petitions were ignored. We were told that if we wanted more or  greater variety of food we must buy it from the canteen. We had to act  upon this recommendation just to keep ourselves alive.    The canteen was run by the most unprincipled scoundrel I have ever met.  He was a civilian speculator who saw the chance to fatten on the  British prisoners. He fleeced us in two ways. Not only were his prices  extortionate, but he gave a ridiculous exchange for British currency,  especially gold. After considerable persuasion and deliberation he would  change a half sovereign for 7-1/2 marks--7s. 6d. We complained but could  get no redress for such a depreciation. Other coins were in proportion.    Broedchen in limited quantities were brought in every day. We could buy  these at 5 pfennigs--one halfpenny--apiece, or in the early days three  for 10 pfennigs. The latter practice was abandoned when the pinch of  flour shortage commenced to be felt. The broedchen came in during the  night, and owing to the totally inadequate quantity purchased to meet  our needs, one had to be about early to secure a supply. I, with others,  have often been up at four o'clock in the morning, lounging around the  canteen, so as to be among the first to be served when it opened at five  o'clock. The scenes which were enacted around the canteen in the early  morning are indescribable. Civilians strangely clad, and later badly  wounded, limping soldiers, sickly and white, waited patiently, no matter  what the weather, to buy a little bread.    The necessity to depend upon the canteen for a sufficiency of food to  keep us alive hit those who were blessed with little money extremely  hard. There was one man--he said he was an Englishman, although I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18183"],[0,"Trees, Fruits and Flowers of Minnesota, 1916 (#19)"],[1,"Johnson: You know the black cap has a different root system from the  reds. The roots of the reds will run out all over the road.    Mr. Willard: How thick do you leave those canes set apart in the row,  how many in a foot?    Mr. Johnson: I generally try to leave them in hills four feet apart, not  let them come in any between. About three or four in a hill. I generally  try to cut out the weak ones.    Mr. Willard: You pinch the end of the tops, I think?    Mr. Johnson: Yes, sir.    A Member: When do you cut those sucker canes?    Mr. Johnson: I generally hoe them just before picking time and loosen  the ground in the row. That is very important, to give them a hoeing,  not hoe down deep, but just loosen that hard crust there and cut all the  plants that you don't want, and then generally, after the berries  commence to ripen, your suckers don't come so fast, and you keep on  cultivating once in a while.    Mr. Brackett: I have some King raspberries, and I never covered them up  in ten years. I will change that. The first year I did cover a part of  my patch, at least one-half of them, and that left the other half  standing, and I couldn't see any difference. Around Excelsior there are  very few people that cover up the King raspberry. But the King raspberry  has run out; all of the old varieties have run out. We have at our  experiment station the No. 4--you can get double the amount of fruit  from the No. 4 than from the King. The best way to grow the King  raspberry or any other raspberry is to set them four feet apart and  cultivate them. If you grow a matted row you are bound to get weeds and  grass in there, you are bound to get them ridged up, but by planting in  hills and cultivating each way you can keep your ground perfectly level.  As far as clipping them back my experience has been it is very hard to  handle them--they will spread out. It is a big job to cover the plants  and then to uncover them again. I know it is not necessary with the No.  4; that is hardy. That is what we want. Hardiness is what we want in a  berry, and you have it in the No. 4.    Mr. Hall: I would like to ask you what you spray with and when you  spray?    Mr. Johnson: The bordeaux mixture. I spray them early in the spring and  just before they start to ripen.    Mr. Wick: With us the Loudon raspberry seems to be the coming raspberry.    Mr. Johnson: Is it doing well now?    Mr. Wick: Yes, it is doing well.    Mr. Ludlow: How many years is the planting of the King raspberry good  for?    Mr. Johnson: I think it would be good for fifteen years or more if they  are handled as I do it. Keep at the plant, hoeing and spraying them  twice a year; trim out the old wood and keep them healthy.    The President: You take out all the old wood every year?    Mr. Johnson: Yes, sir.    Mr. Ludlow: When do you do that?    Mr. Johnson: In the fall. I figure this way, every extra cane that you  grow on the plant is a waste. If I see a cane a little higher than the  others I just stop it, and it throws the sap back.    Mr. Berry: Do you fertilize and how and when?    Mr. Johnson: I found I didn't need much fertilizer. I put on wood ashes  and such things when I burn the trimming of the berries and such things.    A Member: When do you spray?    Mr. Johnson: I generally spray in the spring after they get started and  just before they are starting to ripen. I spray them sometimes when they  are starting to ripen, and the berries would pick up in one day.    A Member: You mean to say you could grow them for fifteen years without  fertilizing?    Mr. Johnson: Yes, sir.           *       *       *       *       *    KNOWLEDGE of the temperature of the pantry and cellar is  important, in order that one may make improvements in conditions.  Putrefaction will start at 50 deg., so that a pantry or closet where  food is kept should have a temperature at least as low as that. Cellars  where canned goods are stored should have a temperature of 32 deg.  or over. Apples are frequently stored in outside cellars, where the  temperature should be kept at 31 deg. or 32 deg.; but apples may be  kept satisfactorily at 34 deg. or 36 deg. When stored at the higher  temperatures, the fruit should be placed there soon after being picked.          Annual Report, 1915, Nevis Trial Station.    JAS. ARROWOOD, SUPT., NEVIS.      We would say that the station is in good condition; all trees and  shrubbery have done well; no complaint as far as growth is concerned.  This being an off year for fruit in this section, the fruit crop in  general was light, the late frost and heavy rains destroying most all,  both wild and tame fruits.    The strawberries, raspberries and currants were fairly good; plums and  apples were very light, except some seedlings, both apples and plums,  which seemed to hold their fruit. Most all the large apples were  destroyed by the freeze, such as Duchess, Wealthy, Greening and  Hibernal. There were some of the Duchess seedlings that seemed to stand  all kinds of freezing.    [Illustration: Jas. Arrowood in his trial orchard, at Nevis, in Northern  Minnesota.]    Now in regard to the fruits that were sent here from Central station.  The majority are doing fairly well, especially in regard to strawberry  No. 3, which is doing splendidly and points to be the coming strawberry  of northern Minnesota. It is a good runner and has a large, dark  foliage. Plants that we left out last winter without covering came  through in splendid condition and made a heavy crop. In regard to the  fruit, it is of the best quality, large and firm and a good keeper. In  regard to raspberries, Nos. 1, 4 and 7 did very well, and stood the  winter without laying down, and bore a good crop.    In regard to the eighteen plum trees I received three years ago, Nos. 1,  4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 have done very well and have made a good growth, but  have had no fruit so far.    The sand cherry that was received the same year, No. 2, has done very  well and bore some fruit this last year of a fair quality.    Hansen cherries are doing fairly well and bore some fruit this year.    Now in regard to plums that were received in 1914 Nos. 2, 3, 8, 10, 13,  20, have all made a good growth. What was received in 1915 have all  grown.    The grapes that we received two years ago have made but little growth.  There were no grapes in this section this year; they all froze off about  twice.    I received at the county fair about sixteen first prizes on apples and  plums this year. We did considerable top-working, mostly on Hibernals  and native seedlings, which are doing very well. Some of our seedling  cherries are commencing to bear and show to be perfectly hardy. They are  of the Oregon strain of sweet cherry.    In regard to gardens, they were fairly good throughout the section. Corn  crop a failure.    In regard to the condition of the trees and shrubbery, this are going  into their winter quarters with lots of moisture and with a large amount  of fruit buds, with a good prospect for fruit next year.           *       *       *       *       *    DESTROYING PLANT LICE.--According to the results of experiments  a 10 per cent kerosene emulsion should prove effective against the green  apple aphis. The kerosene emulsion made either with 66 per cent stock,  10 per cent, or with naphtha soap and cold water, seemed to kill all the  green apple aphides. The 40 per cent nicotine solution, with a dilution  up to 1 to 2,000 combined with soap, were likewise effective  aphidicides. The kerosene emulsions under 10 per cent were not  satisfactory, neither were the soaps at the strengths tested, except  that fish-oil soap, 5 to 50, killed 90 per cent of the aphides. Laundry  soap, 3 to 50, was effective against the young aphides only. Arsenate of  lead alone, as was to be expected, had little or no effect upon the  aphides. The combination of arsenate of calcium with kerosene emulsions  is not a desirable one, since an insoluble calcium soap is formed,  thereby releasing some free kerosene.--U.S. Dpt. of Agri.          New Fruits Originated at Minnesota Fruit-Breeding Farm.    CHAS. HARALSON, SUPT., EXCELSIOR.      The subject on which I am to talk is rather difficult to present at this  time, but I will mention a few of the most promising new varieties.    [Illustration: The new and valuable hardy raspberry No. 4, growing at  State Fruit-Breeding Farm.]    We have developed several hundred new varieties of fruit since we  started fruit-breeding at the State Fruit Farm. Many of them are very  promising, but it probably will take several years before we really know  what we have that will be of value to the public.    We have been growing thousands of seedlings of apples, plums, grapes,  raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries and currants, from which  valuable varieties have been selected. All of them have been put under  propagation in a small way for testing at the Fruit Farm, trial  stations and many other places. Some very favorable reports from several  places have been received during the last year from parties who have  fruited these new creations. We also have some hybrid peach and apricot  seedlings which have stood the test of the last two winters. Some of  them blossomed very freely last spring, but on account of the hard  freeze in May they did not set any fruit. I hope to be able to report on  these another year.    [Illustration: Hybrid plum No. 21--at Minnesota State Fruit-Breeding  Farm.]    The results of breeding strawberries have given us one everbearing and  one June-bearing variety, which have been tested in many places  throughout the state. The June-bearing variety has been introduced as  Minnesota No. 3. The berries are almost identical with Senator Dunlap in  color and shape, but somewhat larger and, I think, more productive. The  plants are equal to Dunlap in hardiness, or more so, a stronger plant,  and a good plant-maker. The fruiting season is about a week earlier than  Dunlap. "]]]
