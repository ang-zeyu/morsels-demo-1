All the tribes of the Vril-ya are in constant  communication with each other, and settle amongst themselves each  year what proportion of one community will unite with the emigrants of  another, so as to form a state of sufficient size; and the place for  emigration is agreed upon at least a year before, and pioneers sent from  each state to level rocks, and embank waters, and construct houses; so  that when the emigrants at last go, they find a city already made, and a  country around it at least partially cleared. Our hardy life as children  make us take cheerfully to travel and adventure. I mean to emigrate  myself when of age.\"    \"Do the emigrants always select places hitherto uninhabited and barren?\"    \"As yet generally, because it is our rule never to destroy except  when necessary to our well-being. Of course, we cannot settle in lands  already occupied by the Vril-ya; and if we take the cultivated lands  of the other races of Ana, we must utterly destroy the previous  inhabitants. Sometimes, as it is, we take waste spots, and find that  a troublesome, quarrelsome race of Ana, especially if under the  administration of Koom-Posh or Glek-Nas, resents our vicinity, and picks  a quarrel with us; then, of course, as menacing our welfare, we destroy  it: there is no coming to terms of peace with a race so idiotic that  it is always changing the form of government which represents it.  Koom-Posh,\" said the child, emphatically, \"is bad enough, still it has  brains, though at the back of its head, and is not without a heart; but  in Glek-Nas the brain and heart of the creatures disappear, and they  become all jaws, claws, and belly.\" \"You express yourself strongly.  Allow me to inform you that I myself, and I am proud to say it, am the  citizen of a Koom-Posh.\"    \"I no longer,\" answered Taee, \"wonder to see you here so far from your  home. What was the condition of your native community before it became a  Koom-Posh?\"    \"A settlement of emigrants--like those settlements which your tribe  sends forth--but so far unlike your settlements, that it was dependent  on the state from which it came. It shook off that yoke, and, crowned  with eternal glory, became a Koom-Posh.\"    \"Eternal glory! How long has the Koom-Posh lasted?\"    \"About 100 years.\"    \"The length of an An's life--a very young community. In much less than  another 100 years your Koom-Posh will be a Glek-Nas.\"    \"Nay, the oldest states in the world I come from, have such faith in its  duration, that they are all gradually shaping their institutions so  as to melt into ours, and their most thoughtful politicians say that,  whether they like it or not, the inevitable tendency of these old states  is towards Koom-Posh-erie.\"    \"The old states?\"    \"Yes, the old states.\"    \"With populations very small in proportion to the area of productive  land?\"    \"On the contrary, with populations very large in proportion to that  area.\"    \"I see! old states indeed!--so old as to become drivelling if they don't  pack off that surplus population as we do ours--very old states!--very,  very old! Pray, Tish, do you think it wise for very old men to try to  turn head-over-heels as very young children do? And if you ask them why  they attempted such antics, should you not laugh if they answered that  by imitating very young children they could become very young children  themselves? Ancient history abounds with instances of this sort a great  many thousand years ago--and in every instance a very old state that  played at Koom-Posh soon tumbled into Glek-Nas. Then, in horror of its  own self, it cried out for a master, as an old man in his dotage cries  out for a nurse; and after a succession of masters or nurses, more or  less long, that very old state died out of history. A very old state  attempting Koom-Posh-erie is like a very old man who pulls down the  house to which he has been accustomed, but he has so exhausted his  vigour in pulling down, that all he can do in the way of rebuilding is  to run up a crazy hut, in which himself and his successors whine out,  'How the wind blows! How the walls shake!'\"    \"My dear Taee, I make all excuse for your unenlightened prejudices,  which every schoolboy educated in a Koom-Posh could easily controvert,  though he might not be so precociously learned in ancient history as you  appear to be.\"    \"I learned! not a bit of it. But would a schoolboy, educated in your  Koom-Posh, ask his great-great-grandfather or great-great-grandmother  to stand on his or her head with the feet uppermost? And if the poor old  folks hesitated--say, 'What do you fear?--see how I do it!'\"    \"Taee, I disdain to argue with a child of your age. I repeat, I make  allowances for your want of that culture which a Koom-Posh alone can  bestow.\"    \"I, in my turn,\" answered Taee, with an air of the suave but lofty good  breeding which characterises his race, \"not only make allowances for  you as not educated among the Vril-ya, but I entreat you to vouchsafe me  your pardon for the insufficient respect to the habits and opinions of  so amiable a Tish!\"    I ought before to have observed that I was commonly called Tish by my  host and his family, as being a polite and indeed a pet name, literally  signifying a small barbarian; the children apply it endearingly to the  tame species of Frog which they keep in their gardens.    We had now reached the banks of a lake, and Taee here paused to point  out to me the ravages made in fields skirting it. \"The enemy certainly  lies within these waters,\" said Taee. \"Observe what shoals of fish are  crowded together at the margin. Even the great fishes with the small  ones, who are their habitual prey and who generally shun them, all  forget their instincts in the presence of a common destroyer. This  reptile certainly must belong to the class of Krek-a, which are more  devouring than any other, and are said to be among the few surviving  species of the world's dreadest inhabitants before the Ana were created.  The appetite of a Krek is insatiable--it feeds alike upon vegetable and  animal life; but for the swift-footed creatures of the elk species it  is too slow in its movements. Its favourite dainty is an An when it can  catch him unawares; and hence the Ana destroy it relentlessly whenever  it enters their dominion. I have heard that when our forefathers first  cleared this country, these monsters, and others like them, abounded,  and, vril being then undiscovered, many of our race were devoured. It  was impossible to exterminate them wholly till that discovery which  constitutes the power and sustains the civilisation of our race. But  after the uses of vril became familiar to us, all creatures inimical  to us were soon annihilated. Still, once a-year or so, one of these  enormous creatures wanders from the unreclaimed and savage districts  beyond, and within my memory one has seized upon a young Gy who was  bathing in this very lake. Had she been on land and armed with her  staff, it would not have dared even to show itself; for, like all savage  creatures, the reptile has a marvellous instinct, which warns it against  the bearer of the vril wand. How they teach their young to avoid him,  though seen for the first time, is one of those mysteries which you may  ask Zee to explain, for I cannot. The reptile in this instinct does but  resemble our wild birds and animals, which will not come in reach of a  man armed with a gun. When the electric wires were first put up,  partridges struck against them in their flight, and fell down wounded.  No younger generations of partridges meet with a similar accident. So  long as I stand here, the monster will not stir from its lurking-place;  but we must now decoy it forth.\"    \"Will that not be difficult?\"    \"Not at all. Seat yourself yonder on that crag (about one hundred  yards from the bank), while I retire to a distance. In a short time the  reptile will catch sight or scent of you, and perceiving that you are no  vril-bearer, will come forth to devour you. As soon as it is fairly out  of the water, it becomes my prey.\"    \"Do you mean to tell me that I am to be the decoy to that horrible  monster which could engulf me within its jaws in a second! I beg to  decline.\"    The child laughed. \"Fear nothing,\" said he; \"only sit still.\"    Instead of obeying the command, I made a bound, and was about to take  fairly to my heels, when Taee touched me slightly on the shoulder, and,  fixing his eyes steadily on mine, I was rooted to the spot. All power of  volition left me. Submissive to the infant's gesture, I followed him  to the crag he had indicated, and seated myself there in silence. Most  readers have seen something of the effects of electro-biology, whether  genuine or spurious. No professor of that doubtful craft had ever been  able to influence a thought or a movement of mine, but I was a mere  machine at the will of this terrible child. Meanwhile he expanded his  wings, soared aloft, and alighted amidst a copse at the brow of a hill  at some distance.    I was alone; and turning my eyes with an indescribable sensation of  horror towards the lake, I kept them fixed on its water, spell-bound. It  might be ten or fifteen minutes, to me it seemed ages, before the still  surface, gleaming under the lamplight, began to be agitated towards  the centre. At the same time the shoals of fish near the margin evinced  their sense of the enemy's approach by splash and leap and bubbling  circle. I could detect their hurried flight hither and thither, some  even casting themselves ashore. A long, dark, undulous furrow came  moving along the waters, nearer and nearer, till the vast head of the  reptile emerged--its jaws bristling with fangs, and its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#19)"],[1," end, may be seen a kind of  small museum of fragments from various parts of the church, collected at  the time of the restoration, among them some bosses from the vaulting of  the south transept, destroyed about a hundred years ago, and fragments  of a Norman font. The vaulting of this and the corresponding aisle on  the south side is of the same character as that of the choir, but is  somewhat plainer, and is not decorated with crosses or pendants.  On the south side of this aisle is a late Perpendicular chantry, built  in accordance with the will of Sir William Berkeley, dated 1486, to  commemorate himself and his wife. Part of the inscription ... ARMIGERI  MARGARETE QUE CONSOR ... can still be read on the frieze; on its flat  ceiling are painted two large roses, one white, one red; it contains two  brackets for cruets; over the entrance to it is placed an oval memorial  tablet to one John Cook, who died in 1787. Eastward of this is the  Salisbury chapel already described. On the north wall of the aisle is a  monument, consisting of an altar-tomb with a front of carved quatrefoils  and a purbeck slab, dating about 1550. The canopy over it is later, and  the coat of arms beneath it is that of Robert White of Hadlow, Kent, who  is commemorated on a board at the west end of the church as a benefactor  who left L100 in land for the poor in 1619, thus fixing the date of this  portion of the tomb. The scroll beneath the arms has the initials R. W.,  and the motto \"Suffer in Tym.\" A chantry is formed at the eastern end of  the aisle by the western end of the north wall of the Lady Chapel. It  contains an altar tomb with the recumbent figures of Sir John Chidioke,  a Dorset knight, slain in 1449 in the Wars of the Roses, and his wife.  This monument has occupied its present position only from 1791,--it  previously stood in the north transept.    [Illustration: THE DRAPER CHANTRY.]    The east end of the south choir aisle is occupied by the chantry chapel  of John Draper II., the last of the priors and titular bishop of  Neapolis in Palestine, near the ancient Shechem in Samaria; it is dated  1529, and is formed by a screen of Caen stone stretching across the  aisle. There is a central doorway with a depressed arch at the top, and  canopied niches over it, and on either side are two transomed four-light  unglazed windows under arches of the same character as that over the  doorway; along the top of the screen runs a battlemented parapet. Within  the chantry, on the south wall, is a very beautiful piscina, the finest  in the church. Just outside the screen is a square-headed doorway.  Along the south wall of this aisle, as along the north wall of the  corresponding north aisle, a stone bench-table runs. On the north side  the panelled wall on which the Countess of Malmesbury's altar tomb  stands is decorated with carvings of angels; the largest of these holds  a shield with a death's-head. Farther to the west, beyond the steps  leading down from the choir, is a Perpendicular chantry, known as the  Harys chantry; it has open tracery above cusped panels, canopied niches,  and a panelled bench table. Robert Harys was rector of Shrowston, and  died in 1525; his rebus, a hare under the letter R, may be seen on the  panels. On the opposite side of the aisle is the doorway leading into  what is known as the #sacristy#. This is a thirteenth-century addition  to the church, and is of irregular shape, as it is wedged in, as it  were, between the apsidal chapel on the east side of the transept and  the south wall of the choir aisle. In the south wall are triple sedilia  with Purbeck shafts and foliated heads; in the north wall is a square  opening or squint.    [Illustration: PISCINA IN THE DRAPER CHANTRY.]    [Illustration: THE SACRISTY.]    Behind the reredos is an ambulatory or processional path; from this may  be seen, over the archway leading into the south aisle, the end of the  \"miraculous beam,\" lengthened, according to the legend, by Christ, when  He appeared as a workman and took part in the building of the original  church. How this came to be preserved, and how it came to occupy a  position amidst the latest work in the church, is not recorded. The Lady  Chapel is very beautiful Perpendicular work; it had its own altar and  reredos under the east window. The reredos is much mutilated, but  besides the part that is still attached to the wall, there are many  loose fragments now set up on the altar. This is a slab of Purbeck  stone, 11 ft. in length and 3 ft. 10 ins in breadth. On the north and  south sides of the altar are the tombs of Thomas, Lord West, and Lady  Alice West, his mother. These tombs are of Purbeck marble and of a form  by no means uncommon in the churches of Wessex. The ten shafts  supporting the canopy of the tomb on the north still remain; from the  other tomb such shafts as it had have disappeared. Thomas, Lord West,  died in 1406, his mother in 1395: these dates fix within reasonable  limits the date of the building of the Lady Chapel. Thomas West, in his  will, directs that his body should be buried in the \"_New_ Chapel of Our  Lady in the Mynster of Christchurch.\" It is noteworthy to remark that  the original arcading is cut away to make room for this monument, so  that the chapel had been finished before he died. Both Sir Thomas West  and his mother were benefactors to the church. Besides other bequests of  money towards the building fund and for perpetual masses, each of them  gave about L18 for the singing of 4500 masses within six months of the  day of their deaths. On the south side of the chapel is the original  doorway leading into the canons' burial-ground; a corresponding door is  to be seen on the north side. The splays of the arches of the windows  are elaborately ornamented with panelling. The arcading under the  window, a series of ogee arches, is worthy of notice. The tattered  colours of the \"Loyal Christchurch Volunteers,\" one of the earliest  regiments of volunteers, which was enrolled in 1793, hang at the  entrance to the Lady Chapel. The vaulting is of the same character as  that of the choir, with curious pendants in the form of church lanterns.    [Illustration: THE MIRACULOUS BEAM.]    [Illustration: THE TOMB OF THOMAS, LORD WEST.]    [Illustration: THE LADY CHAPEL.]    [Illustration: ST MICHAEL'S LOFT.]    #St Michael's Loft# is reached by long flights of steps running up the  turrets described in the last chapter. It is a plain, low room with a  low-pitched tie-beam roof of oak. It was once a chapel, as the piscina  in the east wall clearly shows. The site of the altar is now occupied by  a disused desk of the character familiar to us in our own school days  some half-a-century ago; it is a sort of pew with doors, within which  the master sat enthroned and ramparted. This room was used as a public  grammar school from 1662 till 1828, and subsequently as a private  school, which was finally closed in 1869. The boys went to this school  and returned from it by the staircase on the north side which has an  entrance from the churchyard; the stairs on the south side were used  when anyone had occasion to go into the church or to go from it to the  room above.    An upper chamber or chapel is an uncommon feature in England. Remains of  staircases give rise to the conjecture that there was a similar chapel  over the Lady Chapel at Chester, and somewhat similar erections are to  be met with on the Continent; but Christchurch Priory is unique in  possessing such a perfect specimen. The dedication of the upper storey  to St Michael, the conductor of souls to Paradise, is appropriate.  Churches built in elevated positions were frequently dedicated to him,  and few if any mediaeval churches dedicated to this archangel are to be  met with on low-lying ground.    Under the western tower stands a modern font. The fragments of a  Norman font, with carvings representing various incidents in the  life of Christ, may be seen, preserved in the north choir aisle. The  fifteenth-century successor has been removed to Bransgore Church, four  miles off.    Against the north wall of the tower stands the monument of the poet  Shelley, the work of the sculptor Weekes. Needless to say, it is but  a cenotaph. The \"heart of hearts,\" \"Cor Cordium,\" and the ashes of the  poet cremated on the Tuscan shore, lie far away, hard by the pyramid  of Caius Cestius, in the grave where the loving hands of Trelawney laid  them in 1823. Here we have an ideal representation of the finding of the  drowned body--not a pleasing one, but less ghastly than the reality; and  below the inscription which tells his name and the number of his years  and the manner of his death, the following stanza from his own \"Adonais\"  may be read:--       \"He hath out-soared the shadow of our night:      Envy and calumny and hate and pain,      And that unrest which men miscall delight,      Can touch him not and torture not again;      From the contagion of the world's slow stain      He is secure, and now can never mourn      A heart grown cold, a head grown grey in vain,      Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn      With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.\"    The choice of Christchurch Priory as the site for this monument was due  to the fact that the poet's son, Sir Percy Florence Shelley, who erected  it, lived at Boscombe Manor, between Christchurch and Bournemouth.    The tower contains a peal of eight bells. These are all old; the fifth  and sixth bells have fourteenth-century inscriptions round their crowns,  the others appear to have been cast early in the fifteenth century.
