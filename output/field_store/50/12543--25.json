Nor do we often realize the vital place that this watering has  in taking care of our food. \"Well begun is half-done,\" is literally  true of digestion. A good flow of saliva brings the food into contact  with the taste-buds in the tongue. Taste sends messages to the  nerve-centers in the medulla oblongata; these centers in turn flash  signals to the stomach glands, which immediately \"get busy\" preparing  the all-important gastric juice. It takes about five minutes for this  juice to be made ready, and so it happens that in five minutes after  the first taste, or even in some cases after the first smell, the  stomach is pouring forth its \"appetite juice\" which determines all the  rest of the digestive process, in intestines as well as in stomach.  Experiments on dogs and cats by Pawlow, Cannon, and others have shown  what fear and anger and even mildly unpleasant emotions do to the  whole digestive process. Cannon tells of a dog who produced 66.7 cubic  centimeters of pure gastric juice in the twenty minutes following five  minutes of sham feeding (feeding in which food is swallowed and then  dropped out of an opening in the esophagus into a bucket instead of  into the stomach). Although there was no food in the stomach, the  juice was produced by the enjoyment of the taste and the thought of  it. On another day, after this dog had been infuriated by a cat, and  then pacified, the sham feeding was given again. This time, although  the dog ate eagerly, he produced only 9 cubic centimeters of gastric  juice, and this rich in mucus. Evidently a good appetite and  attractively served food are not more important than a cheerful mind.  Spicy table talk, well mixed with laughter, is better than all the  digestive tablets in the world. What is true of stomach secretions is  equally true of stomach contractions. \"The pleasurable taking of food\"  is a necessity if the required contractions of stomach and intestines  are to go forward on schedule time. A little extra dose of adrenalin  from a mild case of depression or worry is enough to stop all  movements for many minutes. What a revelation on many a case of  nervous dyspepsia! The person who dubbed it \"Emotional Dyspepsia\" had  facts on his side.    =Circulation.= It is not the heart only that pumps the blood through  the body. The tiny muscles of the smallest blood-vessels, by their  elasticity are of the greatest importance in maintaining an even flow,  and this is especially influenced by fear and depression. Blushing,  pallor, cold hands and feet, are circulatory disturbances based  largely on emotions. Better than a hot-water bottle or electric pads  are courage and optimism. A patient of mine laughingly tells of an  incident which she says happened a number of years ago, but which I  have forgotten. She says that she asked me one night as she carried  her hot-water bottle to bed, \"Doctor, what makes cold feet?\" and that  I lightly answered \"Cowardice!\" Whereupon she threw away her beloved  water-bag and has never needed it since.    There is a disturbance of the circulation which results in very  marked swelling and redness of the affected part. This is known as  angio-neurotic edema, or nervous swelling. I do not have to go farther  than my own person for an example of this phenomenon. When I was a  young woman I taught school and went home every day for luncheon. One  day at luncheon, some one of the family criticized me severely. I went  back to school very angry. Before I entered the school-room, the  principal handed me some books which she had ordered for me. They were  not at all the books I wanted, and that upset me still more. As I went  into the schoolroom, I found that my face was swollen until my eyes  were almost shut; it was a bright red and covered with purplish  blotches. My fingers were swollen so that I could not bend the joints  in the slightest degree. It was a day or two before the disturbance  disappeared, and the whole of it was the result of anger.    We hear much to-day about high blood pressure. They say that a man is  as old as his arteries, and now it is known that the health of the  arteries depends largely on blood pressure. Since this is a matter  that can be definitely measured at any minute, we have an easy way of  noting the remarkable effect of shifting emotions. Sadler tells of an  ex-convict with a blood pressure of 190 millimeters. It seems that he  was worrying over possible rearrest. On being reassured on this  point, his blood pressure began to drop within a few minutes, falling  20 mm. in three hours, and 35 mm. by the following day.    =Muscular Tone.= A force that affects circulation, blood pressure,  respiration, nutrition of cells, secretion, and digestion, can hardly  fail to have a marked effect on the tone of the muscles, internal as  well as external. When we remember that heart, stomach, and intestines  are made of muscular tissue, to say nothing of the skeletal muscles,  we begin to realize how important is muscular tone for bodily health.  Over and over again have I demonstrated that a courageous mind is the  best tonic. Perhaps an example from my \"flat-footed\" patients will be  to the point. One woman, the young mother of a family, came to me for  a nervous trouble. Besides this, she had suffered for seven or eight  years from severe pains in her feet and had been compelled to wear  specially made shoes prescribed by a Chicago orthopedist. The shoes,  however, did not seem to lessen the pain. After an ordinary day's  occupation, she could not even walk across the floor at dinner-time. A  walk of two blocks would incapacitate her for many days. She was  convinced that her feet could never be cured and came to me only on  account of nervous trouble. On the day of her arrival she flung  herself down on the couch, saying that she would like to go away from  everybody, where the children would never bother her again. She was  sure nobody loved her and she wanted to die. Within three weeks, in  ordinary shoes, this woman tramped nine miles up Mount Wilson and the  next day tramped down again. Her attitude had changed from that of  irritable fretfulness to one of buoyant joy, and with the moral change  had come new strength in the muscles. The death of her husband has  since made it necessary for her to support the family, and she is now  on her feet from eight to fourteen hours a day, a constant source of  inspiration to all about her, and no more weary than the average  person.    Flabbiness in the muscles often causes this trouble with the feet.  \"The arches of the foot are maintained by ligaments between the bones,  supported by muscle tendons which prevent undue stretching of the  ligaments and are a protection against flat-foot.\"[31] Muscle tissue  has an abundant blood supply, while ligaments have very little and  soon lose their resiliency if unsupported. Any lack of tone in the  calf-muscles throws the weight on the less resistant ligaments and on  the cartilages placed as cushions between the bony structures of the  arch. This is what causes the pain.[32]    [Footnote 31: Grey's Anatomy--\"The Articulations.\"]    [Footnote 32: Actual loss of the arch by downward displacement of the  bones cannot be overcome by restoring muscle-tone. The majority of  so-called cases of flatfoot are, however, in the stage amenable to  psychic measures.]    Flat-footedness is only one result of weak muscles. Eye-strain is  another; ptosis, or falling of the organs, is another. In a majority  of cases the best treatment for any of these troubles is an  understanding attempt to go to the root of the matter by bracing up  the whole mental tone. The most scientific oculists do not try to  correct eye trouble due to muscular insufficiency by any special  prisms or glasses. They know that the eyes will right themselves when  the general health and the general spirits improve. I have found by  repeated experience with nervous patients that it takes only a short  time for people who have been unable to read for months or years to  regain their old faculty. So remarkable is the power of mind.      SUMMARY    We have found that the gap between the body and the mind is not so  wide as it seems, and that it is bridged by the subconscious mind,  which is at once the master of the body and the servant of  consciousness. In recording the physical effects of suggestion and  emotion, we have not taken time to describe the galvanometers, the  weighing-machines and all the other apparatus used in the various  laboratory tests; but enough has been said to show that when doctors  and psychologists speak of the effect of mind on body, they are  dealing with definite facts and with laws capable of scientific  proof.    We have emphasized the fact that downcast and fearful moods have an  immediate effect on the body; but after all, most people know this  already. What they do not know is the real cause of the mood. When a  nervous person finds out why he worries, he is well on the way toward  recovery. An understanding of the cause is among the most vital  discoveries of modern science.    The discussion, so far, has merely prepared us to plunge into the  heart of the question: What is it that in the last analysis makes a  person nervous, and how may he find his way out? This question the  next two chapters will try to answer.          CHAPTER VII    _In which we go to the root of the matter_    THE REAL TROUBLE      PIONEERS    =Following the Gleam.= Kipling's Elephant-child with the \"'satiable  curiosity\" finally asked a question which seemed simple enough but  which sent him on a long journey into unknown parts. In the same way  man's modest and simple question, \"What makes people nervous?\" has  sent him far-adventuring to find the answer. For centuries he has  followed false trails,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#19)"],[1," despise the stings of pain, but the storms of fortune,  especially if we have recourse to that retreat which was pointed out in  our yesterday's discussion; for, as if some God had advised a man who  was pursued by pirates to throw himself overboard, saying, \"There is  something at hand to receive you; either a dolphin will take you up, as  it did Arion of Methymna; or those horses sent by Neptune to Pelops  (who are said to have carried chariots so rapidly as to be borne up by  the waves) will receive you, and convey you wherever you please. Cast  away all fear.\" So, though your pains be ever so sharp and  disagreeable, if the case is not such that it is worth your while to  endure them, you see whither you may betake yourself. I think this will  do for the present. But perhaps you still abide by your opinion.    _A._ Not in the least, indeed; and I hope I am freed by these two days'  discourses from the fear of two things that I greatly dreaded.    _M._ To-morrow, then, for rhetoric, as we were saying. But I see we  must not drop our philosophy.    _A._ No, indeed; we will have the one in the forenoon, and this at the  usual time.    _M._ It shall be so, and I will comply with your very laudable  inclinations.           *       *       *       *       *          BOOK III.    ON GRIEF OF MIND.      I. What reason shall I assign, O Brutus, why, as we consist of mind and  body, the art of curing and preserving the body should be so much  sought after, and the invention of it, as being so useful, should be  ascribed to the immortal Gods; but the medicine of the mind should not  have been so much the object of inquiry while it was unknown, nor so  much attended to and cultivated after its discovery, nor so well  received or approved of by some, and accounted actually disagreeable,  and looked upon with an envious eye by many? Is it because we, by means  of the mind, judge of the pains and disorders of the body, but do not,  by means of the body, arrive at any perception of the disorders of the  mind? Hence it comes that the mind only judges of itself when that very  faculty by which it is judged is in a bad state. Had nature given us  faculties for discerning and viewing herself, and could we go through  life by keeping our eye on her--our best guide--there would be no  reason certainly why any one should be in want of philosophy or  learning; but, as it is, she has furnished us only with some feeble  rays of light, which we immediately extinguish so completely by evil  habits and erroneous opinions that the light of nature is nowhere  visible. The seeds of virtues are natural to our constitutions, and,  were they suffered to come to maturity, would naturally conduct us to a  happy life; but now, as soon as we are born and received into the  world, we are instantly familiarized with all kinds of depravity and  perversity of opinions; so that we may be said almost to suck in error  with our nurse's milk. When we return to our parents, and are put into  the hands of tutors and governors, we are imbued with so many errors  that truth gives place to falsehood, and nature herself to established  opinion.    II. To these we may add the poets; who, on account of the appearance  they exhibit of learning and wisdom, are heard, read, and got by heart,  and make a deep impression on our minds. But when to these are added  the people, who are, as it were, one great body of instructors, and the  multitude, who declare unanimously for what is wrong, then are we  altogether overwhelmed with bad opinions, and revolt entirely from  nature; so that they seem to deprive us of our best guide who have  decided that there is nothing better for man, nothing more worthy of  being desired by him, nothing more excellent, than honors and commands,  and a high reputation with the people; which indeed every excellent man  aims at; but while he pursues that only true honor which nature has in  view above all other objects, he finds himself busied in arrant  trifles, and in pursuit of no conspicuous form of virtue, but only some  shadowy representation of glory. For glory is a real and express  substance, not a mere shadow. It consists in the united praise of good  men, the free voice of those who form a true judgment of pre-eminent  virtue; it is, as it were, the very echo of virtue; and being generally  the attendant on laudable actions, should not be slighted by good men.  But popular fame, which would pretend to imitate it, is hasty and  inconsiderate, and generally commends wicked and immoral actions, and  throws discredit upon the appearance and beauty of honesty by assuming  a resemblance of it. And it is owing to their not being able to  discover the difference between them that some men ignorant of real  excellence, and in what it consists, have been the destruction of their  country and of themselves. And thus the best men have erred, not so  much in their intentions as by a mistaken conduct. What? is no cure to  be attempted to be applied to those who are carried away by the love of  money, or the lust of pleasures, by which they are rendered little  short of madmen, which is the case of all weak people? or is it because  the disorders of the mind are less dangerous than those of the body? or  because the body will admit of a cure, while there is no medicine  whatever for the mind?    III. But there are more disorders of the mind than of the body, and  they are of a more dangerous nature; for these very disorders are the  more offensive because they belong to the mind and disturb it; and the  mind, when disordered, is, as Ennius says, in a constant error: it can  neither bear nor endure anything, and is under the perpetual influence  of desires. Now, what disorders can be worse to the body than these two  distempers of the mind (for I overlook others), weakness and desire?  But how, indeed, can it be maintained that the mind cannot prescribe  for itself, when she it is who has invented the medicines for the body,  when, with regard to bodily cures, constitution and nature have a great  share, nor do all who suffer themselves to be cured find that effect  instantly; but those minds which are disposed to be cured, and submit  to the precepts of the wise, may undoubtedly recover a healthy state?  Philosophy is certainly the medicine of the soul, whose assistance we  do not seek from abroad, as in bodily disorders, but we ourselves are  bound to exert our utmost energy and power in order to effect our cure.  But as to philosophy in general, I have, I think, in my Hortensius,  sufficiently spoken of the credit and attention which it deserves:  since that, indeed, I have been continually either disputing or writing  on its most material branches; and I have laid down in these books all  the discussions which took place between myself and my particular  friends at my Tusculan villa. But as I have spoken in the two former of  pain and death, this book shall be devoted to the account of the third  day of our disputations.    We came down into the Academy when the day was already declining  towards afternoon, and I asked one of those who were present to propose  a subject for us to discourse on; and then the business was carried on  in this manner:    IV. _A._ My opinion is, that a wise man is subject to grief.    _M._ What, and to the other perturbations of mind, as fears, lusts,  anger? For these are pretty much like what the Greeks call [Greek:  pathe]. I might call them diseases, and that would be a literal  translation, but it is not agreeable to our way of speaking. For envy,  delight, and pleasure are all called by the Greeks diseases, being  affections of the mind not in subordination to reason; but we, I think,  are right in calling the same motions of a disturbed soul  perturbations, and in very seldom using the term diseases; though,  perhaps, it appears otherwise to you.    _A._ I am of your opinion.    _M._ And do you think a wise man subject to these?    _A._ Entirely, I think.    _M._ Then that boasted wisdom is but of small account, if it differs so  little from madness?    _A._ What? does every commotion of the mind seem to you to be madness?    _M._ Not to me only; but I apprehend, though I have often been  surprised at it, that it appeared so to our ancestors many ages before  Socrates; from whom is derived all that philosophy which relates to  life and morals.    _A._ How so?    _M._ Because the name madness[35] implies a sickness of the mind and  disease; that is to say, an unsoundness and an unhealthiness of mind,  which they call madness. But the philosophers call all perturbations of  the soul diseases, and their opinion is that no fool is ever free from  these; but all that are diseased are unsound; and the minds of all  fools are diseased; therefore all fools are mad. For they held that  soundness of the mind depends on a certain tranquillity and steadiness;  and a mind which was destitute of these qualities they called insane,  because soundness was inconsistent with a perturbed mind just as much  as with a disordered body.    V. Nor were they less ingenious in calling the state of the soul devoid  of the light of the mind, \"a being out of one's mind,\" \"a being beside  one's self.\" From whence we may understand that they who gave these  names to things were of the same opinion with Socrates, that all silly  people were unsound, which the Stoics have carefully preserved as being  derived from him; for whatever mind is distempered (and, as I just now  said, the philosophers call all perturbed motions of the mind  distempers) is no more sound than a body is when in a fit of sickness.  Hence it is that wisdom is the soundness of the mind, folly a sort of  unsoundness, which is insanity, or a being out of one's mind: and these  are much better expressed by the Latin words than the Greek, which you  will find the case also in many other topics. But we will discuss that  point elsewhere: let us now attend to our present "]]]
