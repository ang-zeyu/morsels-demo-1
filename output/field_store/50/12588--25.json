The rate of growth is determined in this way: A tree is cut and the      rings on the cross-section surface are counted and measured; see      Fig. 124. Each ring represents one year's growth. The total number      of rings will show the age of the tree. By a study of the rings of      the various species of trees on a given plot, the rate of growth of      each species in that location can be ascertained and, by knowing the      approximate number of trees of each species on the forest area, the      rate of growth of the whole forest for any given year can be      determined.    [Illustration: FIG. 126.--Bottom Lands Buried in Waste from Deforested  Mountains. Wu-t'ai-shan, Shan-si Province, China.]    [Illustration: FIG. 127.--Eroded Slope in Western North Carolina.]    Forests prevent soil erosion and floods: Forests help to regulate the      flow of streams and prevent floods. Most streams are bordered by      vast tracts of forest growths. The rain that falls on these forest      areas is absorbed and held by the forest soil, which is permeated      with decayed leaves, decayed wood and root fibers. The forest floor      is, moreover, covered with a heavy undergrowth and thus behaves like      a sponge, absorbing the water that falls upon it and then permitting      it to ooze out gradually to the valleys and rivers below. A forest      soil will retain one-half of its own quantity of water; i.e., for      every foot in depth of soil there can be six inches of water and,      when thus saturated, the soil will act as a vast, underground      reservoir from which the springs and streams are supplied (Fig.      125). Cut the forest down and the land becomes such a desert as is      shown in Fig. 126. The soil, leaves, branches and fallen trees dry      to dust, are carried off by the wind and, with the fall of rain, the      soil begins to wash away and gullies, such as are shown in Fig. 127,      are formed. Streams generally have their origins in mountain slopes      and there, too, the forests, impeding the sudden run off of the      water which is not immediately absorbed, prevent soil erosion.    [Illustration: FIG. 128.--Flood in Pittsburgh, Pa.]        Where the soil is allowed to wash off, frequent floods are      inevitable. Rain which falls on bare slopes is not caught by the      crowns of trees nor held by the forest floor. It does not sink into      the ground as readily as in the forest. The result is that a great      deal of water reaches the streams in a short time and thus hastens      floods. At other periods the streams are low because the water which      would have fed them for months has run off in a few days. The farms      are the first to suffer from the drouths that follow and, during the      period of floods, whole cities are often inundated. Fig. 128 shows      such a scene. The history of Forestry is full of horrible incidents      of the loss of life and property from floods which are directly      traceable to the destruction of the local forests and, on the other      hand, there are many cases on record where flood conditions have      been entirely obviated by the planting of forests. France and      Germany have suffered from inundations resulting from forest      devastation and, more than a hundred years ago, both of these      countries took steps to reforest their mountain slopes, and thereby      to prevent many horrible disasters.    [Illustration: FIG. 129.--Planting a Forest with Seedling Trees on the  Nebraska National Forest. The man on the right is placing the tree in a  slit just made with the spade. The man on the left is shoveling the dry  sand from the surface before making the slit for the tree.]    [Illustration: FIG. 130.--Diagrammatic Illustration of a Selection  Forest.]    How forests are established: New forests may be started from seed or      from shoots, or suckers. If from seed, the process may be carried on      in one of three ways:        First, by sowing the seed directly on the land.        Second, by first raising young trees in nurseries and later setting      them out in their permanent locations in the forest. This method is      applicable where quick results are desired, where the area is not      too large, or in treeless regions and large open gaps where there      is little chance for new trees to spring up from seed furnished by      the neighboring trees. It is a method extensively practiced abroad      where some of the finest forests are the result. The U.S.      government, as well as many of the States, maintain forest-tree      nurseries where millions of little trees are grown from seed and      planted out on the National and State forests. Fig. 129 shows men      engaged in this work. The fundamental principles of starting and      maintaining a nursery have already been referred to in the chapter      on \"What Trees to Plant and How.\"        The third method of establishing a forest from seed is by cutting      the trees in the existing forest so that the seed falling from the      remaining trees will, with the addition of light and space, readily      take root and fill in the gaps with a vigorous growth of trees,      without artificial seeding or planting. This gives rise to several      methods of cutting or harvesting forests for the purpose of      encouraging natural reproduction. The cutting may extend to single      trees over the whole area or over only a part of the whole area.      Where the cutting is confined to single trees, the system is known      as the \"Selection System,\" because the trees are selected      individually, with a view to retaining the best and most vigorous      stock and removing the overcrowding specimens and those that are      fully mature or infested with disease or insects.        Fig. 130 is a diagrammatic illustration of the operation of this      system. In another system the cutting is done in groups, or in      strips, and the number of areas of the groups or strips is extended      from time to time until the whole forest is cleared. This system is      illustrated in Fig. 131. Still another method consists in      encouraging trees which will thrive in the shade, such as the beech,      spruce and hemlock, to grow under light-demanding trees like the      pine. This system presents a \"two-storied\" forest and is known by      that name. The under story often has to be established by planting.    [Illustration: FIG. 131.--Diagrammatic Illustration of the Group or  Strip System.]        In the system of reproducing forests from shoots or suckers, all      trees of a certain species on a given area are cut off and the old      stumps and roots are depended upon to produce a new set of sprouts,      the strongest of which will later develop into trees. The coniferous      trees do not lend themselves at all to this system of treatment,      and, among the broadleaf trees, the species vary in their ability to      sprout. Some, like the chestnut and poplar, sprout profusely; others      sprout very little.    How forests are protected: Forestry also tries to protect the forests      from many destructive agencies. Wasteful lumbering and fire are the      worst enemies of the forest. Fungi, insects, grazing, wind, snow and      floods are the other enemies.    [Illustration: FIG. 132.--The Result of a Forest Fire. The trees,  lodgepole pine and Englemann spruce, are all dead and down. Photograph  taken in the Colorado National Forest, Colorado.]        By wasteful lumbering is meant that the forest is cut with no regard      for the future and with considerable waste in the utilization of the      product. Conservative lumbering, which is the term used by foresters      to designate the opposite of wasteful lumbering, will be described      more fully later in this study.        Protection from fire is no less important than protection from      wasteful lumbering. Forest fires are very common in this country and      cause incalculable destruction to life and property; see Fig. 132.      From ten to twelve million acres of forest-land are burnt over      annually and the timber destroyed is estimated at fifty millions of      dollars. The history of Forestry abounds in tales of destructive      fires, where thousands of persons have been killed or left      destitute, whole towns wiped out, and millions of dollars in      property destroyed. In most cases, these uncontrollable fires      started from small conflagrations that could readily, with proper      fire-patrol, have been put out.        There are various ways of fighting fires, depending on the character      of the fire,--whether it is a surface fire, burning along the      surface layer of dry leaves and small ground vegetation, a ground      fire, burning below the surface, through the layer of soil and      vegetable matter that generally lines the forest floor, or a top      fire, burning high up in the trees.        When the fire runs along the surface only, the injury extends to the      butts of the trees and to the young seedlings. Such fires can be put      out by throwing dirt or sand over the fire, by beating it, and,      sometimes, by merely raking the leaves away.        Ground fires destroy the vegetable mold which the trees need for      their sustenance. They progress slowly and kill or weaken the roots      of the trees.    [Illustration: FIG. 133.--A Top Fire near Bear Canyon, Arizona.]        Top fires, Fig. 133, are the most dangerous, destroying everything      in their way. They generally develop from surface fires, though      sometimes they are started by lightning. They are more common in      coniferous forests, because the leaves of hardwoods do not burn so      readily. Checking the progress of a top fire is a difficult matter.      Some fires will travel as rapidly as five miles an hour, and the      heat is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16130"],[0,"Judgments of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand on Proceedings to Review Aspects (#19)"],[1,"themselves. There has been an endeavour, without selection, to       reveal all the evidence to reveal all the documents ...\".    This statement by senior counsel for the airline as to the manner in  which he had attempted to handle his responsibilities should be enough  to answer the complaint in the Appendix that \"The management of the  airline _instructed its counsel_ to deny every allegation of fault, and  to counter-attack by ascribing total culpability to the air crew\". The  tribute the Commissioner paid counsel in paragraph 375 (the same counsel  appeared in this Court for the applicants) is not altogether consistent  with those last remarks. In any event the appendix continues--         \"Apart from that, there were material elements of information in       the possession of the airline which were originally not disclosed,       omissions for which counsel for the airline were in no way       responsible, and which successively came to light at different       stages of the Inquiry when the hearings had been going on for       weeks, in some cases for months.\"    A final comment should be made about the criticisms of the airline  concerning the position it adopted concerning pilot error as a cause of  the accident.    In the course of his evidence (at p. 272) Mr. Chippindale was asked by  the Commissioner: \"Was not the position Capt. Collins must have clearly  have thought he was flying toward McMurdo over McMurdo Sound?\" He said,  \"It is my belief that this could be the only possible reason for him to  continue\". That is an important answer. It means that in this respect  Mr. Chippindale had reached the same conclusion as the Commissioner but  for general reasons of logic whereas the latter was influenced by his  finding that Captain Collins had made use of the New Zealand Atlas or a  chart in order to plot the position of the waypoint and the route to be  taken by the aircraft.    But although this general conclusion about McMurdo Sound was shared it  is at this point that the two investigations diverged in terms of pilot  responsibility for the accident. The Commissioner was of the opinion  that until the last moment the pilots believed they were flying in clear  air; that they were deceived by a whiteout situation; and that it was  understandable that they flew on at 2000 and then 1500 feet. Mr.  Chippindale was aware of and spoke in his report about the whiteout  phenomenon, but after giving evidence before the Royal Commission for  eight days he still adhered to his conclusion of pilot error for reasons  he expressed (at p. 274) in the following way:         \"I believe that the cause as it stands (in the Chief Inspector's       report) is reasonable. As I attempted to clarify last time the       pilot has descended to 2000 ft and evidently is unable to see       anything ahead. I say 'evidently' because there is a snow slope       leading to a mountain rising to 12 450 feet and that was directly       in front of him. He 'popped down', to use his own words, another       500 feet and continued to progress towards an ice cliff which is       300 feet high, the lower 50 per cent of which is solid and bare       rock. And still he didn't perceive anything to persuade him to       divert from his track. To me this indicates it was an area of poor       definition and as such he would not be able to discern what he       could expect to see had he been, as various people suppose,       believing that he was proceeding down the McMurdo Sound. The sea       ice is by no means uniform in texture and during his descent he       would have seen the nature of the sea ice--in fact the photos from       the passengers indicate that it had large breaks in its surface and       was quite easily discerned so therefore I believe at the end of his       descent to 2000 ft he was confronted with a very vague area in       front of him which he may or may not have believed was cloud, and       when descending a further 500 feet the view ahead of him would have       been of equally poor definition. Despite this, he continued to the       point of 26 miles from destination as indicated presumably on the       AINS.\"    Mr. Chippindale's opinion has some background relevance in the present  case. It is in no way relevant because it differs from that of the  Commissioner upon the issue of causation. Already we have emphasized and  we do so once again that what was said in the Royal Commission Report  about the cause or causes of the accident must stand entirely unaffected  by these proceedings. But the opinion has some relevance because  although it was wrong, as the Royal Commission Report decided, the  Commissioner certainly did not consider it to be anything other than a  completely conscientious and honest attempt by Mr. Chippindale to  analyse and draw a rational conclusion from all the available facts. He  described Mr. Chippindale as a model witness. In the circumstances it is  difficult to understand why the same point of view Mr. Chippindale  expressed in his evidence could not be genuinely shared by other  educated observers.    We turn now to the relief sought by these various officers and the  airline itself.      The Claim for Relief    The applicants seek relief in the form of an order that the findings be  set aside or for a declaration that the various findings are invalid or  made in excess of jurisdiction; or were made in circumstances involving  unfairness and breaches of the rules of natural justice. In addition we  are asked to make an order quashing the decision of the Commissioner  that the airline should pay to the Department of Justice the sum of  $150,000 by way of costs.    Earlier in this judgment we have said that if the challenged findings  were made without jurisdiction or contrary to natural justice then it  would be possible for the Court to take steps by way of declaration to  offer at least some form of redress. And we went on to explain why we  think the Royal Commission was bound by the broad requirements of  natural justice. As an example of what would be required to meet  obligations of fairness we then referred to the need for a reasonable  opportunity of meeting unformulated suspicions of deception and  concealment that had been in the Commissioner's mind. However, before we  turn to the natural justice part of the case it is convenient to  consider the claim of excess jurisdiction, and that by confining our  attention to the terms of reference.    The submission of counsel for the sixth respondent is that the  statements contained in each of the two paragraphs 348 and 377 are  relevant to and justified by the following items of the terms of  reference:         (g) Whether the crash of the aircraft or the death of the       passengers and crew was caused or contributed to by any person       (whether or not that person was on board the aircraft) by an act       or omission in respect of any function in relation to the       operation, maintenance, servicing, flying, navigation, manoeuvring,       or air traffic control of the aircraft, being a function which that       person had a duty to perform or which good aviation practice       required that person to perform?         (j) And other facts or matters arising out of the crash that, in       the interests of public safety, should be known to the authorities       charged with the administration of civil aviation in order that       appropriate measures may be taken for the safety of persons engaged       in aviation or carried as passengers in aircraft.    In its essentials the argument is that in order to answer the questions  posed by paragraph (g) the Commissioner found it necessary or was  entitled to explain the process by which he reached his final  conclusions; that in doing so he was entitled to comment upon the  quality of the evidence that was given in the course of the Royal  Commission Inquiry; that the assessment of witnesses was a necessary  part of the findings he reached as to the cause of the accident; that  the assessment was not a part of the substantive findings of the  Commission; and \"whether having reached his conclusion he expresses  himself vehemently or refrains from pungent comment is entirely a matter  for him\". Similar submissions were made in relation to the second cause  of action and natural justice.    In certain circumstances it is obvious enough that reasons for rejecting  evidence would not merely be relevant but often a necessary part of a  decision. But considerations of that kind are far removed from the  conclusions expressed in paragraph 377. There it is said that the ten  senior members of this airline had been involved in organized deception.  \"Palpably false sections of evidence ... a pre-determined plan of  deception ... an attempt to conceal a series of disastrous  administrative blunders ... an orchestrated litany of lies\". These are  unlikely phrases to associate with a mere assessment of the credibility  of witnesses.    In the Courts it is constantly necessary to indicate a preference for  the evidence of one witness or to make a decision to put evidence  completely to one side; sometimes it even seems necessary to describe  evidence in terms of perjury. But in the Courts Judges always attempt to  be most circumspect in handling issues of this kind, particularly if  misconduct seems apparent which is not immediately associated with the  central issues in the case. There can be no less reason for  circumspection in the case of a Royal Commission at least where the  terms of reference do not directly give rise to inquiries into criminal  dealing. In _Re The Royal Commission on Licensing_ (1945) N.Z.L.R. 665  Sir Michael Myers C.J. dealt with the point in the following way (at p.  680):         \"A Commission of Inquiry under the statute and a Royal Commission       under the Letters Patent are alike in this respect--each of them is       an inquiry, not an inquisition.
