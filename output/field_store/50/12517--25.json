I have every confidence in the arrangements I have made with       my friends outside, and I do not therefore expect to have       another opportunity of seeing you. I therefore take this       occasion to observe that I consider your treatment of       prisoners is correct and humane, and that I see no grounds       for complaint. When I return to the British lines I will make       a public statement to this effect. I have also to thank you       personally for your civility to me, and to express the hope       that we may meet again at Pretoria before very long, and under       different circumstances. Regretting that I am unable to bid       you a more ceremonious or a personal farewell,         I have the honour, to be, Sir,       Your most obedient servant,       WINSTON CHURCHILL.         To Mr. de Souza,       Secretary of War, South African Republic.      I arranged that this letter, which I took great pleasure in writing,  should be left on my bed, and discovered so soon as my flight was known.    It only remained now to find a hat. Luckily for me Mr. Adrian Hofmeyr, a  Dutch clergyman and pastor of Zeerust, had ventured before the war to  express opinions contrary to those which the Boers thought befitting  for a Dutchman to hold. They had therefore seized him on the outbreak of  hostilities, and after much ill-treatment and many indignities on the  Western border, brought him to the States Schools. He knew most of the  officials, and could, I think, easily have obtained his liberty had he  pretended to be in sympathy with the Republics. He was, however, a true  man, and after the clergyman of the Church of England, who was rather a  poor creature, omitted to read the prayer for the Queen one Sunday, it  was to Hofmeyr's evening services alone that most of the officers would  go. I borrowed his hat.          CHAPTER XI    I ESCAPE FROM THE BOERS      Lourenco Marques: December 22, 1899,    How unhappy is that poor man who loses his liberty! What can the wide  world give him in exchange? No degree of material comfort, no  consciousness of correct behaviour, can balance the hateful degradation  of imprisonment. Before I had been an hour in captivity, as the previous  pages evidence, I resolved to escape. Many plans suggested themselves,  were examined, and rejected. For a month I thought of nothing else. But  the peril and difficulty restrained action. I think that it was the  report of the British defeat at Stormberg that clinched the matter. All  the news we heard in Pretoria was derived from Boer sources, and was  hideously exaggerated and distorted. Every day we read in the  'Volksstem'--probably the most astounding tissue of lies ever presented  to the public under the name of a newspaper--of Boer victories and of  the huge slaughters and shameful flights of the British. However much  one might doubt and discount these tales, they made a deep impression. A  month's feeding on such literary garbage weakens the constitution of the  mind. We wretched prisoners lost heart. Perhaps Great Britain would not  persevere; perhaps Foreign Powers would intervene; perhaps there would  be another disgraceful, cowardly peace. At the best the war and our  confinement would be prolonged for many months. I do not pretend that  impatience at being locked up was not the foundation of my  determination; but I should never have screwed up my courage to make the  attempt without the earnest desire to do something, however small, to  help the British cause. Of course, I am a man of peace. I did not then  contemplate becoming an officer of Irregular Horse. But swords are not  the only weapons in the world. Something may be done with a pen. So I  determined to take all hazards; and, indeed, the affair was one of very  great danger and difficulty.    The States Model Schools stand in the midst of a quadrangle, and are  surrounded on two sides by an iron grille and on two by a corrugated  iron fence about 10 ft. high. These boundaries offered little obstacle  to anyone who possessed the activity of youth, but the fact that they  were guarded on the inside by sentries, fifty yards apart, armed with  rifle and revolver, made them a well-nigh insuperable barrier. No walls  are so hard to pierce as living walls. I thought of the penetrating  power of gold, and the sentries were sounded. They were incorruptible. I  seek not to deprive them of the credit, but the truth is that the  bribery market in the Transvaal has been spoiled by the millionaires. I  could not afford with my slender resources to insult them heavily  enough. So nothing remained but to break out in spite of them. With  another officer who may for the present--since he is still a  prisoner--remain nameless, I formed a scheme.    [Illustration: Plan of States Model Schools]    After anxious reflection and continual watching, it was discovered that  when the sentries near the offices walked about on their beats they were  at certain moments unable to see the top of a few yards of the wall. The  electric lights in the middle of the quadrangle brilliantly lighted the  whole place but cut off the sentries beyond them from looking at the  eastern wall, for from behind the lights all seemed darkness by  contrast. The first thing was therefore to pass the two sentries near  the offices. It was necessary to hit off the exact moment when both  their backs should be turned together. After the wall was scaled we  should be in the garden of the villa next door. There our plan came to  an end. Everything after this was vague and uncertain. How to get out of  the garden, how to pass unnoticed through the streets, how to evade the  patrols that surrounded the town, and above all how to cover the two  hundred and eighty miles to the Portuguese frontiers, were questions  which would arise at a later stage. All attempts to communicate with  friends outside had failed. We cherished the hope that with chocolate,  a little Kaffir knowledge, and a great deal of luck, we might march the  distance in a fortnight, buying mealies at the native kraals and lying  hidden by day. But it did not look a very promising prospect.    We determined to try on the night of the 11th of December, making up our  minds quite suddenly in the morning, for these things are best done on  the spur of the moment. I passed the afternoon in positive terror.  Nothing, since my schooldays, has ever disturbed me so much as this.  There is something appalling in the idea of stealing secretly off in the  night like a guilty thief. The fear of detection has a pang of its own.  Besides, we knew quite well that on occasion, even on excuse, the  sentries would fire. Fifteen yards is a short range. And beyond the  immediate danger lay a prospect of severe hardship and suffering, only  faint hopes of success, and the probability at the best of five months  in Pretoria Gaol.    The afternoon dragged tediously away. I tried to read Mr. Lecky's  'History of England,' but for the first time in my life that wise  writer wearied me. I played chess and was hopelessly beaten. At last it  grew dark. At seven o'clock the bell for dinner rang and the officers  trooped off. Now was the time. But the sentries gave us no chance. They  did not walk about. One of them stood exactly opposite the only  practicable part of the wall. We waited for two hours, but the attempt  was plainly impossible, and so with a most unsatisfactory feeling of  relief to bed.    Tuesday, the 12th! Another day of fear, but fear crystallising more and  more into desperation. Anything was better than further suspense. Night  came again. Again the dinner bell sounded. Choosing my opportunity I  strolled across the quadrangle and secreted myself in one of the  offices. Through a chink I watched the sentries. For half an hour they  remained stolid and obstructive. Then all of a sudden one turned and  walked up to his comrade and they began to talk. Their backs were  turned. Now or never. I darted out of my hiding place and ran to the  wall, seized the top with my hands and drew myself up. Twice I let  myself down again in sickly hesitation, and then with a third resolve  scrambled up. The top was flat. Lying on it I had one parting glimpse of  the sentries, still talking, still with their backs turned; but, I  repeat, fifteen yards away. Then I lowered myself silently down into the  adjoining garden and crouched among the shrubs. I was free. The first  step had been taken, and it was irrevocable.    It now remained to await the arrival of my comrade. The bushes of the  garden gave a good deal of cover, and in the moonlight their shadows lay  black on the ground. Twenty yards away was the house, and I had not been  five minutes in hiding before I perceived that it was full of people;  the windows revealed brightly lighted rooms, and within I could see  figures moving about. This was a fresh complication. We had always  thought the house unoccupied. Presently--how long afterwards I do not  know, for the ordinary measures of time, hours, minutes, and seconds are  quite meaningless on such occasions--a man came out of the door and  walked across the garden in my direction. Scarcely ten yards away he  stopped and stood still, looking steadily towards me. I cannot describe  the surge of panic which nearly overwhelmed me. I must be discovered. I  dared not stir an inch. My heart beat so violently that I felt sick. But  amid a tumult of emotion, reason, seated firmly on her throne,  whispered, 'Trust to the dark background.' I remained absolutely  motionless. For a long time the man and I remained opposite each other,  and every instant I expected him to spring forward. A vague idea crossed  my mind that I might silence him. 'Hush, I am a detective. We expect  that an officer will break out here to-night. I am waiting to catch  him.'

His first lecture--and only one at  this period--was given at the Society Library, in New York, on the ninth  of February, and was upon the cosmogony of the Universe: it was attended  by an eminently intellectual auditory, and the reading of it occupied  about two hours and a half; it was what he afterward published under the  title of \"Eureka, a Prose Poem.\"    To the composition of this work he brought his subtlest and highest  capacities, in their most perfect development. Denying that the arcana of  the universe can be explored by induction, but informing his imagination  with the various results of science, he entered with unhesitating  boldness, though with no guide but the divinest instinct,--that sense of  beauty, in which our great Edwards recognizes the flowering of all  truth--into the sea of speculation, and there built up of according laws  and their phenomena, as under the influence of a scientific inspiration,  his theory of Nature. I will not attempt the difficult task of condensing  his propositions; to be apprehended they must be studied in his own terse  and simple language; but in this we have a summary of that which he  regards as fundamental: \"The law which we call _Gravity_,\" he says,  \"exists on account of matter having been radiated, at its origin,  atomically, into a _limited_ sphere of space, from one, individual,  unconditional irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper,  by the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same  time, the two conditions, radiation and equable distribution throughout  the sphere--that is to say, by a force varying in _direct_ proportion  with the squares of the distances between the radiated atoms,  respectively, and the particular center of radiation.\"    Poe was thoroughly persuaded that he had discovered the great secret:  that the propositions of \"Eureka\" were true; and he was wont to talk of  the subject with a sublime and electrical enthusiasm which they cannot  have forgotten who were familiar with him at the period of its  publication. He felt that an author known solely by his adventures in the  lighter literature, throwing down the gauntlet to professors of science,  could not expect absolute fairness, and he had no hope but in discussions  led by wisdom and candor. Meeting me, he said, \"Have you read 'Eureka?'\"  I answered, \"Not yet: I have just glanced at the notice of it by Willis,  who thinks it contains no more fact than fantasy, and I am sorry to  see--sorry if it be true--suggests that it corresponds in tone with that  gathering of sham and obsolete hypotheses addressed to fanciful tyros,  the 'Vestiges of Creation;' and our good and really wise friend Bush,  whom you will admit to be of all the professors, in temper one of the  most habitually just, thinks that while you may have guessed very  shrewdly, it would not be difficult to suggest many difficulties in the  way of your doctrine.\" \"It is by no means ingenuous,\" he replied, \"to  hint that there are such difficulties, and yet to leave them unsuggested.  I challenge the investigation of every point in the book. I deny that  there are any difficulties which I have not met and overthrown. Injustice  is done me by the application of this word 'guess:' I have assumed  _nothing_ and proved _all_.\" In his preface he wrote: \"To the few who  love me and whom I love; to those who feel rather than to those who  think; to the dreamers and those who put faith in dreams as in the only  realities--I offer this book of truths, not in the character of  Truth-Teller, but for the beauty that abounds in its truth: constituting  it true. To these I present the composition as an Art-Product  alone:---let us say as a Romance; or, if it be not urging too lofty a  claim, as a Poem. What I here propound is true: therefore it cannot die:  or it by any means it be now trodden down so that it die, it will rise  again to the life everlasting.\"    When I read \"Eureka\" I could not help but think it immeasurably superior  as an illustration of genius to the \"Vestiges of Creation;\" and as I  admired the poem, (except the miserable attempt at humor in what purports  to be a letter found in a bottle floating on the _Mare tenebrarum_,) so I  regretted its pantheism, which is not necessary to its main design. To  some of the objections to his work be made this answer in a letter to Mr.  C.F. Hoffman, then editor of the _Literary World_:    \"_Dear Sir_:--In your paper of July 29, I find some comments on 'Eureka,'  a late book of my own; and I know you too well to suppose for a moment,  that you will refuse me the privilege of a few words in reply. I feel,  even, that I might safely claim, from Mr. Hoffman, the right, which every  author has, of replying to his critic _tone for tone_--that is to say, of  answering your correspondent, flippancy by flippancy and sneer by  sneer--but in the first place, I do not wish to disgrace the _World_;  and, in the second, I feel that I never should be done sneering, in the  present instance, were I once to begin. Lamartine blames Voltaire for the  use which he made of (_ruse_) misrepresentation, in his attacks on the  priesthood; but our young students of Theology do not seem to be aware  that in defense or what they fancy to be defense, of Christianity, there  is anything wrong in such gentlemanly peccadillos as the deliberate  perversion of an author's text--to say nothing of the minor _indecora_ of  reviewing a book without reading it and without having the faintest  suspicion of what it is about.    \"You will understand that it is merely the _misrepresentations_ of the  _critique_ in question to which I claim the privilege of reply:--the mere  _opinions_ of the writer can be of no consequence to me--and I should  imagine of very little to himself--that is to say if he knows himself,  personally, as well as _I_ have the honor of knowing him. The first  misrepresentation is contained in this sentence:--'This letter is a keen  burlesque on the Aristotelian or Baconian methods of ascertaining Truth,  both of which the writer ridicules and despises, and pours forth his  rhapsodical ecstasies in a glorification of the third mode--the noble art  of _guessing_.' What I _really_ say is this:--That there is no absolute  _certainty_ either in the Aristotelian or Baconian process--that, for  this reason, neither Philosophy is so profound as it fancies itself--and  that neither has a right to sneer at that _seemingly_ imaginative process  called Intuition (by which the great Kepler attained his laws); since  'Intuition,' after all, 'is but the conviction arising from those  _in_ductions or _de_ductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to  escape our consciousness, elude our reason or defy our capacity of  expression.' The second misrepresentation runs thus:--'The developments  of electricity and the formation of stars and suns, luminous and  nonluminous, moons and planets, with their rings, &c., is deduced, very  much according to the nebular theory of Laplace, from the principle  propounded above.' Now the impression intended to be made here upon the  reader's mind, by the 'Student of Theology,' is evidently, that my theory  may all be very well in its way, but that it is nothing but Laplace over  again, with some modifications that he (the Student of Theology) cannot  regard as at all important. I have only to say that no gentleman can  accuse me of the disengenuousness here implied; inasmuch as, having  proceeded with my theory up to that point at which Laplace's theory  _meets_ it, I then _give Laplace's theory in full_, with the expression  of my firm conviction of its absolute truth _at all points_. The _ground_  covered by the great French astronomer compares with that covered by my  theory, as a bubble compares with the ocean on which it floats; nor has  he the slightest allusion to the 'principle propounded above,' the  principle of Unity being the source of all things--the principle of  Gravity being merely the Reaction of the Divine Act which irradiated all  things from Unity. In fact _no_ point of _my_ theory has been even  so much as alluded to by Laplace. I have not considered it necessary,  here to speak of the astronomical knowledge displayed in the 'stars _and_  suns' of the Student of Theology, nor to hint that it would be better to  say that 'development and formation _are_, than that development and  formation _is_. The third misrepresentation lies in a foot-note, where  the critic says:--'Further than this, Mr. Poe's claim that he can account  for the existence of all organized beings--man included--merely from  those principles on which the origin and present appearance of suns and  worlds are explained, must be set down as mere bald assertion, without a  particle of evidence. In other words we should term it _arrant fudge_.'  The perversion at this point is involved in a willful misapplication of  the word 'principles.' I say 'wilful' because, at page 63, I am  _particularly_ careful to distinguish between the principles proper,  Attraction and Repulsion, and those merely resultant _sub_-principles  which control the universe in detail. To these sub-principles, swayed by  the immediate spiritual influence of Deity. I leave, without examination,  _all that_ which the Student of Theology so roundly asserts I account for  on the _principles_ which account for the constitution of suns, &c.    \"In the third column of his 'review' the critic says:--'He"]]]
