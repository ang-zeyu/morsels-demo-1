But this is not the case.  They are enormous, and they appear enormous. They have an effect of  gigantic and aspiring simplicity and vigour both inside and outside.  They fill a given space in so obvious and efficient a manner, that it  might seem that no other way of filling it could have occurred to the  architect: that he was forced by a lucky chance to place them there.  That, of course, is the greatest triumph of genius. It is a piece of  luck however that they still retain their ancient glass--Early English  glass of the simplest design, and of a beautiful silvery greyish green  tint. Without it, no doubt, their effect would be entirely different.    The great size and height of the lantern has already been mentioned.    The wooden vault is covered with ribs elaborately reticulated.    There are two windows with simple Perpendicular tracery and transoms on  each side. A single shaft runs between each window.    Below the windows there is an arcade of ten ogee arches on each side of  the lantern, with pinnacles between. Above this arcade is a row of  quatrefoils.    Below each division of the arcade are figures alternating with bosses of  foliage.    In the spandrels of the main arches are coats of arms with angels above  them.    #The Chapter-House# and #Vestibule.#--The vestibule leading to the  chapter-house is entered at the north-east end of the north transept by  a doorway of very curious design. It consists of two arched openings  separated by a pier. Above the two arches is an acutely-pointed gable,  within which, supported by the arches, is a circle with cinquefoil  tracery. Above the gable is a further arch, the ribs of which join the  gable at its exterior angles. This arch is further connected with the  gable by a rib running horizontally through the crown of the gable, and  below this rib, on each side of the gable, are circles quatrefoiled.  From the finial at the top of the gable rise three ribs running to the  top of the arch above.    It is impossible to understand the intention of this strange design,  unless we suppose that the architect was determined to cover a certain  blank space of wall at any cost. It is certainly an original effort, but  it cannot be called either beautiful or logical.    The dates of the chapter-house and the vestibule are very doubtful. The  question is discussed in the account of the building of the minster. It  may be mentioned here, however, that the vestibule is later in date than  the chapter-house itself.    The vestibule is a lofty and narrow passage running three bays north  from the end of the transept, and then turning at right angles and  running two bays east until it reaches the chapter-house itself. Just  inside the vestibule will be seen the point at which the Early English  work of the transept is interrupted by the Decorated work of the  vestibule. There is no attempt at continuity. The Early English arcading  breaks off just below the first Decorated window; the Early English  shafts above it run close to the Decorated shafts of that window; while  the Early English vaulting rib is cut off near its crown. It would  appear from this that a passage to the chapter-house was begun and  discontinued before the building of the chapter-house itself. The  present vestibule was certainly built after the chapter-house, and the  exterior parapet mouldings of the chapter-house may be seen within the  vestibule, showing that it was almost an afterthought. Over the doorway  leading into the vestibule is a pattern of blind tracery. Here, and on  many portions of the roof and walls of the vestibule, are traces of old  paintings. The windows are still filled with their magnificent original  glass. The three bays running north are of unequal size, that nearest to  the transept being the smallest, and that farthest away the largest.    The tracery of the two smaller windows is most curious and unusual. The  smallest is also of a very odd shape, being almost as narrow as a lancet  window, with, however, a rather obtuse arch. It is divided into two  lights, which rise without further tracery to about three-quarters of  the height of the whole window. Into the upper part are crowded five  trefoils of different shapes, and piled one on the top of the other. The  mouldings of the shafts have a slenderness and delicacy characteristic  of the whole of the choir and the vestibule. The slenderness is one of  the chief arguments for the later date assigned to them. All the shafts  have rich capitals. The next window is filled with even more curious  tracery. It is divided into four lights, rising only to almost half the  height of the whole window. The central mullion is thicker than the  other two. Above these lights are two gables, to the crown of which the  two side mullions run, through an arch below them. Above the gables are  two more arches with trefoils in their heads, and in the crown of the  window a circle cinquefoiled. The unusual feature of the design is the  gables with the lights running through them. They were probably inserted  to strengthen the wall. The next three windows are of splendid design,  resembling that of the clerestory of the nave, but richer. All the  mouldings are of the same character. Under the windows runs an arcade of  blind tracery, two lights to each division, with a cinquefoil ornamented  with a sculptured boss above. These bosses contain alternately foliage  and human heads wreathed in foliage. The capitals are also ornamented  with leaves and curious animals. The vault is of richly-moulded ribs,  and on each side of these is a pattern of white lozenges on a red  ground. The vestibule, as a whole, is one of the most beautiful parts of  the minster, not less for its fine proportions and detail than for its  magnificent stained glass.    #The Chapter-House# is entered by a doorway of most beautiful design,  planned in the same manner as the western entrance of the cathedral, but  plainer in decoration. It consists of a large arch divided into two  smaller arches, each of which contains a door. In the head of the larger  arch is a quatrefoil, at the bottom of which are two carved brackets for  sculpture. Between the two smaller arches is a niche, with a canopy  decorated with a double row of gables and finials. The niche contains a  statue of the Virgin Mary and Infant Christ, so mutilated that little of  their ancient beauty is left. Below this niche are four narrow shafts  with capitals. On each side of the doors is a rich cluster of shafts,  boldly cut and varied, with finely-carved capitals. The mouldings of the  main arch and of the two subordinate arches are plain, but much thicker  and bolder than those of the western doorway. On each side of the main  arch are plain niches with small carved brackets. This doorway on the  inner side is divided by a cluster of shafts, and above it is an oblong  piece of masonry ornamented with arcading enclosed in an obtuse arch.  Above the outer arches of the arcading, on each side, is a niche with  sculpture.    The chapter-house itself is octagonal in form, being divided into eight  bays. Seven of these are filled with windows, the eighth, that over the  entrance, being ornamented with blank tracery of the same design as that  of the windows. These windows are very acutely arched, and their tracery  is of the geometrical Decorated style. They contain five lights, each  light terminating in a trefoiled arch. The central light has further a  very acute arch above it, also filled with a trefoil. The two outer  lights on each side are joined together by an arch above them, in which  is a cinquefoiled circle. Above are three circles arranged pyramidally,  each containing nine cusps. The mullions enclosing the central light are  thicker than the others. All the mullions are broken up into very  slender shafts with capitals. It may be safely said that for elegance,  symmetry, and the ingenious filling of a given space, the tracery of  these windows is not surpassed in Europe.    Between the windows are clusters of shafts which support the ribs of the  vault. These shafts have fine capitals, and are separated from the  windows by blank spaces of wall set at an obtuse angle to the windows,  so that the shafts are pushed forward. Below is an arcade, famous both  for its richness and curiously beautiful design. It consists of a series  of canopies, six to each bay, under each of which is a seat forming the  half of an octagon. At each angle of these seats is a shaft of Purbeck  marble. The seats, or niches, are divided from each other also by shafts  of Purbeck marble. The use of Purbeck marble, both here and in the  doorway of the chapter-house, is worthy of note. It is unusual after the  Early English period, and might be advanced as an argument of the early  date of the chapter-house. In the bay which contains the entrance, there  is a seat on each side of the doorway. The capitals of the Purbeck  marble shafts are carved with unusual richness; but it is the canopies  which demand most attention. They are flat at the top, and each is  divided into three bays in front, the central bay being divided from the  other two by pendants richly carved with foliage of the same character  as the capitals of the shafts. Between the shafts and the pendants are  trefoil arches, one to each bay, and above the arches and pendants are  gables crossing each other and ending in finials of carved oak leaves.  Where the gables cross each other are carved heads and figures. The  sculpture of the arcade as a whole is the finest in the cathedral, and  some of the finest in England; but the art of the Gothic sculptor  reaches its culmination in these heads. In grotesqueness, fertility of  invention, and perfect fitness as decoration they could hardly be  surpassed. The canopies are decorated at the top with a cornice of  carved grapes and vine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#19)"],[1,"done it, too.\"    \"I suppose soldiers do have to be pretty patient,\" remarked Theo  meditatively. \"I never thought before how hard it must be for them  when they are hurt.\"    \"It is one of the great tests of courage,\" said Dr. Swift. \"We all are  liable to think of soldiers only when the drums are beating and the  flags flying. Then it seems a very easy and pleasant thing to be a  soldier. But there is much more to it than that. A great deal of  drudgery is attached to a soldier's life, and frequently a great deal  of suffering. One of the tests of a hero is to be patient when there  is nothing to do but await orders, or perform some menial and  uninteresting task, or lie tossing on a sick-bed. Then you find out  very quickly the sort of stuff your man is made of. Those who fight  are not the biggest heroes. Often the noblest and most helpful men  are those who themselves are not only cheerful under monotony and  dullness, but aid their comrades to be so. Therefore, Theo, when you  took it upon yourself to bear your troubles in the Maine woods bravely  you proved you had the first essential of a good soldier.\"    Theo flushed with pleasure.    \"That is why we cannot have your mother undoing your virtuous  deeds,\" continued the Doctor whimsically. \"We must make her realize  she has a man and not a baby to deal with. Theo is no invalid,  Louisa. On the contrary, he is going right to school to-morrow.\"    \"Not with those crutches!\" protested Mrs. Swift.    \"Why not? He has the term to finish, and certainly you would not have  him flat out on his job when the end is in sight. It is only a few  weeks to the last of June. The fishing trip was a vacation; and if he  got more vacation out of it than he calculated,\" went on Dr. Swift  with a twinkle in his eye, \"why, so much the better. He is that much  to the good.\"    \"I'd rather finish my school year, Mother,\" rejoined Theo.    \"Well, apparently it is two against one,\" smiled Mrs. Swift. \"Your  father is, of course, a far better judge of your condition than  I. Broken bones are in his line. But do be careful, son, and not go  skipping on and off cars when they are moving, or doing things that  are going to worry me.\"    \"Rest easy, Mother. I'll promise not to take any chances,\" Theo  replied promptly. \"I am far too eager to get well. It is no fun to be  hobbling about. Besides, I want to be in trim to go to the Croydens as  soon as school is over.\"    \"Your father says Mr. Croyden was very kind to you while you were in  camp.\"    \"He was bully!\"    \"It would be nice if you could do something to show that you  appreciated it,\" observed Mrs. Swift vaguely.    Instantly Theo caught at the suggestion.    \"I wish I could!\" he declared. \"Can't you think of something, Mother?\"    Mrs. Swift paused a moment.    \"It would be of no use to do anything unless it was something you did  yourself,\" she said at last. \"Of course your father and I could give  you the money to buy a present; but after all that would be our  present and not yours.\"    \"Oh, a gift we bought would not be of the slightest use,\" cut in  Dr. Swift. \"It would spoil the whole idea. Either Theo would have to  purchase something with his own money----\"    \"I have only saved a dollar out of my allowance,\" interrupted Theo  dubiously.    \"Or he would have to do something, or make something, for  Mr. Croyden,\" concluded the Doctor.    \"I don't see what I could do,\" mused Theo.    \"You couldn't make anything, son?\" asked his mother.    \"Nothing good enough,\" responded Theo, shaking his head.    \"Don't they teach you how to make anything at school?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"All head and no hands, I suppose,\" retorted Dr. Swift  scornfully. \"That is the way with our modern educational system. It is  a poor plan on which to bring up a boy. I wish I had realized it  before. Louisa, why didn't you see to this?\" blustered the Doctor.    \"You picked out Theo's studies yourself, my dear.\"    \"I?\"    \"Certainly. You took the outline and checked off the things you wished  Theo to take this year.\"    \"You did, Father,\" put in Theo.    \"When did I do it?\"    \"Oh, one day when you were on your way to a hospital meeting,\"  answered the boy. \"You were in a hurry, and you stood out in the hall  and marked the list with your fountain-pen.\"    \"Then I am heartily ashamed of myself,\" confessed Dr. Swift  candidly. \"I had no right to do anything of the sort. I should have  sat down and put some thought into the matter. Do you suppose it would  be too late, son, for you to change your course of study this term?\"    \"I shouldn't want to change it much, Dad,\" replied Theo. \"I'd be sorry  to give up any of the things I am taking, for I have worked hard at  them and it would be discouraging to have my time all thrown away. But  perhaps now that I am knocked out of athletics I might put those extra  hours into something else. Some of the boys take sloyd.\"    \"The very thing!\" exclaimed the Doctor. \"Manual training is just what  we're after. You would enjoy it, too.\"    \"I don't know whether I would or not, Dad,\" returned Theo frankly. \"I  never was much good with tools. I like athletics better.\"    \"That is because you have never learned to use tools properly,\" said  his father. \"Where do you suppose I'd be now if I hadn't started out  when I was a boy to tinker round a farm? That's where I got my manual  training, and there isn't a course in the country that can equal it. I  had to use my brains, too, as well as my hands, for very often the  things I needed were not to be had and I was forced to make something  else do. It was a great education, I can tell you! What skill I have  at surgery I attribute largely to that early training. Now we'll set  right to work to remedy this lack in you, son. I'll see your principal  to-day and arrange for you to begin sloyd when you go back to school.\"    Theo made a grimace at which his father laughed.    \"If you don't like it you can at least take it as a medicine,\"  remarked the Doctor with a grin.    Dr. Swift was as good as his word, for when Theo returned to school  the following day he found that in addition to his other work he was  expected to spend an hour each morning in the carpenter's shop, a  realm toward which he had always maintained the keenest scorn. It  seemed such a foolish thing to learn to saw and drive nails! What was  the use of taking lessons? When a board was to be cut what was there  to do but take the saw and cut it? It was easy enough. As for driving  nails--that feat required no teaching.    But to Theo's amazement it needed only the first lesson to demonstrate  to him that these superficial conclusions were quite wrong. It was one  thing to cut a board haphazard; but quite another matter to cut it  evenly, and on a ruled line. Nor was the driving of nails as simple  as he had supposed. At the end of the first hour Theo, feeling very  awkward and clumsy, and rubbing a finger that had been too slow to get  out of the path of the hammer, left the workshop.    \"I never dreamed it would be so hard!\" he muttered, viewing his  bleeding knuckle with chagrin.    The lesson of the following day did not prove much easier, and its  difficulties aroused the lad's fighting spirit.    \"I am going to learn to saw and drive nails properly if it takes me  the rest of my life!\" he declared resolutely. \"The very idea! Why,  some of those little chaps in the sloyd room can chisel and plane like  carpenters. I'll bet I can do it, too, if I stick at it.\"    Therefore it came about that instead of missing tennis and basket-ball  as he had expected, Theo became completely absorbed in his new  interest--so absorbed that his father soon began to fear that his  studies would suffer. Early and late Theo was at his bench with his  tools. He tried faithfully not to slight his books, but there was no  use pretending he did not enjoy his carpentry. He was making a  footstool now, a little wooden piece with turned legs which he was to  stain with orange shellac and give to his mother. Already he had  finished a square tray and a handkerchief box. When the stool was  completed he was preparing for a more ambitious enterprise, a thing he  longed yet hesitated to venture upon--a wooden bookrack for  Mr. Croyden.    It was to be made from oak, not from the ordinary pine wood on which,  up to this time, he had been working; and it was to be a much more  elaborately finished article than anything he had undertaken. He had  delayed beginning it until the closing part of the term in order that  he might have the benefit of every atom of training he could get  before he made the first cuts in the wood. As he now framed his plans  for the making of the gift he smiled to think how impossible such a  project would have been a few months ago.    \"Dad was right!\" he affirmed. \"Training your hands is just like  training any other part of your body. The longer and more regularly  you keep at it the more expert you get. Sloyd is no different from  rowing, or football, or tennis.\"    With the help of his instructor he drew his design, measured his  pattern, and sent for the wood.    Then, impatient to begin work, he waited.    Mr. Croyden's birthday he had learned came the last part of June, and  as on that date school ended he had only a short time to make his  present. Not only must the pieces be cut and nailed together but  there was all the finishing, glueing, and varnishing. In addition an  interval was also necessary for drying. Therefore it was imperative  that he set about his task as soon as possible.    Yet day after day went by and the wood did not come.    Theo was almost beside himself.    First he was merely impatient, then angry, then discouraged.    It was not until he had about given up hope of being able to complete  the rack that the wood arrived. The pieces were beautifully grained,  and when Theo beheld them he could in his mind's eye see the  bookshelves shaped, smoothed, and rubbed down. He must"]]]
