The Cimmerians and the Scythians had not suffered themselves to be  disconcerted by the rapidity with which the fate of Sharezer had been  decided, and after a moment's hesitation they had again set out in  various directions on their work of conquest, believing, no doubt, that  they would meet with a less vigorous resistance after so serious an  upheaval at Nineveh. The Cimmerians appear to have been the first to  have provoked hostilities; their king Tiushpa, who ruled over their  territory on the Black Sea, ejected the Assyrian garrisons placed on the  Cappadocian frontier, and his presence in that quarter aroused all  the insubordinate elements still remaining in the Cilician valleys.  Esarhaddon brought him to a stand on the confines of the plain of Saros,  defeated him in Khubushna,* and drove the remains of the horde back  across the Halys.         * Several Assyriologists have thought that Khubushna might       be an error for Khubushkhia, and have sought the seat of war       on the eastern frontier of Assyria: in reality the context       shows that the place under discussion is a district in Asia       Minor, identified with Kamisene by Gelzcr, but left       unidentified by most authorities. Jensen has shown that the       name is mot with as early as the inscriptions of Tiglath-       pileser III., where we should read Khubishna, and he places       the country in Northern Syria, or perhaps further north in       the western part of Taurus. The determinative proves that       there was a town of this name as well as a district, and       this consideration encourages mo to recognise in Khubushna       or Khubishna the town of Kabissos-Kabessos, the Sis of the       kingdom of Lesser Armenia.    Having thus averted the Cimmerian danger, he was able, without  much difficulty, to bring the rebels of the western provinces into  subjection.* His troops thrust back the Cilicians and Duha into the  rugged fastnesses of the Taurus, and razed to the ground one and twenty  of their strongholds, besides burning numberless villages and carrying  the inhabitants away captive.**         * These expeditions are not dated in any of the documents       that deal with them: the fact that they are mentioned along       with the war against Tiushpa and Sidon makes me inclined to       consider them as being a result of the Cimmerian invasion.       They were, strictly speaking, the quelling of revolts caused       by the presence of the Cimmerians in that part of the       empire.         ** The Duua or Duha of this campaign, who are designated as       neighbours of the Tabal, lived in the Anti-taurus: the name       of the town, Tyana, _Tuana_, is possibly composed of their       name and of the suffix _-na_, which is met with in Asianio       languages.    The people of Parnaki, in the bend of the Euphrates between Tel-Assur  and the sources of the Balikh, had taken up arms on hearing of the brief  successes of Tiushpa, but were pitilessly crushed by Esarhaddon. The  sheikh of Arzani, in the extreme south of Syria, close to the brook of  Egypt, had made depredations on the Assyrian frontier, but he was seized  by the nearest governor and sent in chains to Nineveh. A cage was built  for him at the gate of the city, and he was exposed in it to the jeers  of the populace, in company with the bears, dogs, and boars which the  Ninevites were in the habit of keeping confined there. It would appear  that Esarhaddon set himself to come to a final reckoning with Sidon and  Phoenicia, the revolt of which had irritated him all the more, in that  it showed an inexcusable ingratitude towards his family. For it was  Sennacherib who, in order to break the power of Blulai, had not only  rescued Sidon from the dominion of Tyre, but had enriched it with the  spoils taken from its former rulers, and had raised it to the first  rank among the Phoenician cities. Ethbaal in his lifetime had never been  wanting in gratitude, but his successor, Abdimilkot, forgetful of recent  services, had chafed at the burden of a foreign yoke, and had recklessly  thrown it off as soon as an occasion presented itself. He had thought  to strengthen himself by securing the help of a certain Sanduarri,  who possessed the two fortresses of Kundu and Sizu, in the Cilician  mountains;* but neither this alliance nor the insular position of his  capital was able to safeguard him, when once the necessity for stemming  the tide of the Cimmerian influx was over, and the whole of the Assyrian  force was free to be brought against him.         * Some Assyriologists have proposed to locate these two       towns in Cilicia; others place them in the Lebanon, Kundi       being identified with the modern village of Ain-Kundiya. The       name of Kundu so nearly recalls that of Kuinda, the ancient       fort mentioned by Strabo, to the north of Anchiale, between       Tarsus and Anazarbus, that I do not hesitate to identify       them, and to place Kundu in Cilicia.    Abdimilkot attempted to escape by sea before the last attack, but he was  certainly taken prisoner, though the circumstances are unrecorded,  and Sanduarri fell into the enemy's hands a short time after. The  suppression of the rebellion was as vindictive as the ingratitude which  prompted it was heinous. Sidon was given up to the soldiery and then  burnt, while opposite to the ruins of the island city the Assyrians  built a fortress on the mainland, which they called Kar-Esarhaddon. The  other princes of Phoenicia and Syria were hastily convoked, and were  witnesses of the vengeance wreaked on the city, as well as of the  installation of the governor to whom the new province was entrusted.  They could thus see what fate awaited them in the event of their showing  any disposition to rebel, and the majority of them were not slow to  profit by the lesson. The spoil was carried back in triumph to Nineveh,  and comprised, besides the two kings and their families, the remains of  their court and people, and the countless riches which the commerce of  the world had brought into the great ports of the Mediterranean--ebony,  ivory, gold and silver, purple, precious woods, household furniture,  and objects of value from all parts in such quantities that it was long  before the treasury at Nineveh needed any replenishing.* The reverses of  the Cimmerians did not serve as a warning to the Scythians. Settled  on the borders of Manna, partly, no doubt, on the territory formerly  dependent on that state,** they secretly incited the inhabitants to  revolt, and to join in the raids which they made on the valley of the  Upper Zab, and they would even have urged their horses up to the very  walls of Nineveh had the occasion presented itself.         * The importance of the event and the amount of the spoil       captured are apparent, if we notice that Esarhaddon does not       usually record the booty taken after each campaign; he does       so only when the number of objects and of prisoners taken       from the enemy is extraordinary. The _Babylonian Chronicle       of Pinches_ places the capture of Sidon in the second, and       the death of Abdimilkot in the fifth year of his reign.       Hence Winckler has concluded that Abdimilkot held out for       fully two years after the loss of Sidon. The general tenor       of the account, as given by the inscriptions, seems to me to       be that the capture of the king followed closely on the fall       of the town: Abdimilkot and Sanduarri probably spent the       years between 679 and 676 in prison.         ** One of the oracles of Shamash speaks of the captives as       dwelling in a canton of the Mannai.    Esarhaddon, warned of their intrigues by the spies which he sent among  them, could not bring himself either to anticipate their attack or to  assume the offensive, but anxiously consulted the gods with regard to  them: \"O Shamash,\" he wrote to the Sun-god, \"great lord, thou whom I  question, answer me in sincerity! From this day forth, the 22nd day of  this month of Simanu, until the 21st day of the month of Duzu of this  year, during these thirty days and thirty nights, a time has been  foreordained favourable to the work of prophecy. In this time thus  foreordained, the hordes of the Scythians who inhabit a district of the  Mannai, and who have crossed the Mannian frontier,--will they succeed in  their undertaking? Will they emerge from the passes of Khubushkia at  the towns of Kharrania and Anisuskia; will they ravage the borders  of Assyria and steal great booty, immense spoil? that doth thy high  divinity know. Is it a decree, and in the mouth of thy high divinity, O  Shamash, great lord, ordained and promulgated? He who sees, shall he see  it; he who hears, shall he hear it?\"*         * The town of Anisuskia is not mentioned elsewhere, but       Kharrania is met with in the account of the thirty-first       campaign of Shalmaneser III. with Kharrana as its variant.    The god comforted his faithful servant, but there was a brief delay  before his answer threw light on the future, and the king's questions  were constantly renewed as fresh couriers brought in further  information. In 678 B.C. the Scythians determined to try their fortune,  and their king, Ishpakai,* took the field, followed by the Mannai. He  was defeated and driven back to the north of Lake Urumiah, the Mannai  were reduced to subjection, and Assyria once more breathed freely.  The victory, however, was not a final one, and affairs soon assumed as  threatening an aspect as before. The Scythian tribes came on the scene,  one after another, and allied themselves to the various peoples subject  either directly or indirectly to Nineveh.** On one occasion it was  Kashtariti, the regent of Karkashshi,*** who wrote to Mamitiarshu, one  of the Median princes, to induce him to make common cause with himself  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#19)"],[1,"by him, and she accommodated herself  to her Persian dynasty after the same fashion that she had in turn  accustomed herself to Cossaean or Elamite, Ninevite or Chaldaean dynasties  in days gone by. Nothing in or around the city was changed, and she  remained what she had been since the fall of Assyria, the real capital  of the regions situated between the Mediterranean and the Zagros. It  seems that none of her subjects--whether Syrians, Tyrians, Arabs, or  Idumaeans--attempted to revolt against their new master, but passively  accepted him, and the Persian dominion extended uncontested as far as  the isthmus of Suez; Cyprus even, and such of the Phoenicians as  were still dependencies of Egypt, did homage to her without further  hesitation. The Jews alone appeared only half satisfied, for the  clemency shown by Cyrus to their oppressors disappointed their hopes  and the predictions of their prophets. They had sung in anticipation of  children killed before their fathers' eyes, of houses pillaged, of  women violated, and Babylon, the glory of the empire and the beauty  of Chaldaean pride, utterly destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrha when  overthrown by Jahveh. \"It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be  dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch  tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.  But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be  full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and satyrs  shall dance there. And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in  the pleasant palaces.\"*         * The table of the last kings of Ptolemy and the monuments,       is given below:--    [Illustration: 105.jpg TABLE OF THE LAST KINGS OF PTOLEMY]    Cyrus, however, was seated on the throne, and the city of  Nebuchadrezzar, unlike that of Sargon and Sennacherib, still continued  to play her part in the world's history. The revenge of Jerusalem had  not been as complete as that of Samaria, and her sons had to content  themselves with obtaining the cessation of their exile. It is impossible  to say whether they had contributed to the downfall of Nabonidus  otherwise than by the fervency of their prayers, or if they had rendered  Cyrus some service either in the course of his preparations or during  his short campaign. They may have contemplated taking up arms in his  cause, and have been unable to carry the project into execution owing  to the rapidity with which events took place. However this may be, he  desired to reward them for their good intentions, and in the same year  as his victory, he promulgated a solemn edict, in which he granted them  permission to return to Judah and to rebuild not only their city, but  the temple of their God. The inhabitants of the places where they were  living were charged to furnish them with silver, gold, materials, and  cattle, which would be needed by those among them who should claim the  benefits of the edict; they even had restored to them, by order of the  king, what remained in the Babylonian treasury of the vessels of gold  and silver which had belonged to the sanctuary of Jahveh. The heads  of the community received the favour granted to them from such high  quarters, without any enthusiasm. Now that they were free to go, they  discovered that they were well off at Babylon. They would have to  give up their houses, their fields, their business, their habits of  indifference to politics, and brave the dangers of a caravan journey of  three or four months' duration, finally encamping in the midst of  ruins in an impoverished country, surrounded by hostile and jealous  neighbours; such a prospect was not likely to find favour with many, and  indeed it was only the priests, the Levites, and the more ardent of  the lower classes who welcomed the idea of the return with a touching  fervour. The first detachment organised their departure in 536,  under the auspices of one of the princes of the royal house, named  Shauash-baluzur (Sheshbazzar), a son of Jehoiachin.* It comprised only a  small number of families, and contained doubtless a few of the captives  of Nebuchadrezzar who in their childhood had seen the temple standing  and had been present at its destruction.         * The name which is written Sheshbazzar in the Hebrew text       of the Book of Ezra (i. 9, 11; v. 14, 16) is rendered       Sasabalassaros in Lucian's recension of the Septuagint, and       this latter form confirms the hypothesis of Hoonacker, which       is now universally accepted, that it corresponds to the       Babylonian Shamash-abaluzur. It is known that Shamash       becomes Shauash in Babylonian; thus Saosdukhinos comes from       Shamash-shumukin: similarly Shamash-abaluzur has become       Shauash-abaluzur. Imbert has recognised Sheshbazzar,       Shauash-abaluzur in the Shenazzar mentioned in 1 Chron. iii.       8, as being one of the sons of Jeconiah, and this       identification has been accepted by several recent       historians of Israel. It should be remembered that Shauash-       abaluzur and Zerubbabel have long been confounded one with       the other.    The returning exiles at first settled in the small towns of Judah and  Benjamin, and it was not until seven months after their arrival that  they summoned courage to clear the sacred area in order to erect in its  midst an altar of sacrifice.*         * The history of this first return from captivity is       summarily set forth in Ezra i.; cf. v. 13-17; vi. 3-5, 15.       Its authenticity has been denied: with regard to this point       and the questions relating to Jewish history after the       exile, the modifications which have been imposed on the       original plan of this work have obliged me to suppress much       detail in the text and the whole of the bibliography in the       notes.    They formed there, in the land of their fathers, a little colony, almost  lost among the heathen nations of former times--Philistines, Idumasans,  Moabites, Ammonites, and the settlers implanted at various times in what  had been the kingdom of Israel by the sovereigns of Assyria and Chaldaea.  Grouped around the Persian governor, who alone was able to protect them  from the hatred of their rivals, they had no hope of prospering, or even  of maintaining their position, except by exhibiting an unshaken fidelity  to their deliverers. It was on this very feeling that Cyrus mainly  relied when he granted them permission to return to their native  hills, and he was actuated as much by a far-seeing policy as from the  promptings of instinctive generosity. It was with satisfaction that he  saw in that distant province, lying on the frontier of the only enemy  yet left to him in the old world, a small band, devoted perforce to his  interests, and whose very existence depended entirely on that of his  empire. He no doubt extended the same favour to the other exiles in  Chaldaea who demanded it of him, but we do not know how many of them  took advantage of the occasion to return to their native countries, and  this exodus of the Jews still remains, so far as we know, a unique  fact. The administration continued the same as it had been under the  Chaldaeans; Aramaean was still the official language in the provincial  dependencies, and the only change effected was the placing of Persians  at the head of public offices, as in Asia Minor, and allowing them a  body of troops to support their authority.*         * The presence of Persian troops in Asia Minor is proved by       the passage in Herodotus where he says that Orotes had with       him 1000 Persians as his body-guard.    One great state alone remained of all those who had played a prominent  part in the history of the East. This was Egypt; and the policy which  her rulers had pursued since the development of the Iranian power  apparently rendered a struggle with it inevitable. Amasis had taken part  in all the coalitions which had as their object the perpetuation of  the balance of the powers in Western Asia; he had made a treaty with  Croesus, and it is possible that his contingents had fought in the  battles before Sardes; Lydia having fallen, he did all in his power to  encourage Nabonidus in his resistance. As soon as he found himself face  to face with Cyrus, he understood that a collision was imminent, and  did his best in preparing to meet it. Even if Cyrus had forgotten the  support which had been freely given to his rivals, the wealth of Egypt  was in itself sufficient to attract the Persian hordes to her frontiers.    A century later, the Egyptians, looking back on the past with a  melancholy retrospection, confessed that \"never had the valley been  more flourishing or happier than under Amasis; never had the river  shown itself more beneficent to the soil, nor the soil more fertile  for mankind, and the inhabitated towns might be reckoned at 20,000 in  number.\" The widespread activity exhibited under Psammetichus II., and  Apries, was redoubled under the usurper, and the quarries of Turah,*  Silsileh,** Assuan, and even those of Hammamat, were worked as in the  palmy days of the Theban dynasties. The island of Philae, whose position  just below the cataract attracted to it the attention of the military  engineers, was carefully fortified and a temple built upon it, the  materials of which were used later on in the masonry of the sanctuary of  Ptolemaic times. Thebes exhibited a certain outburst of vitality under  the impulse given by Ankhnasnofiribri and by Shashonqu, the governor of  her palace;*** two small chapels, built in the centre of the town, still  witness to the queen's devotion to Amon, of whom she was the priestess.  Wealthy private individuals did their best to emulate their sovereign's  example, and made for themselves at Shekh Abd-el-Gurnah and at Assassif  those rock-hewn tombs which rival those of the best periods in their  extent and the beauty of their bas-"]]]
