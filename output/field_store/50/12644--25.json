They are mentioned along with the       fields or cattle attached to a temple or belonging to a       noble. Ramses II. granted to the temple of Abydos \"an       appanage in cultivated lands, in serfs (_miritiu_), in       cattle.\" The scribe Anna sees in his tomb \"stalls of bulls,       of oxen, of calves, of milch cows, as well as serfs, in the       mortmain of Amon.\" Ptolemy I. returned to the temple at Buto       \"the domains, the boroughs, the serfs, the tillage, the       water supply, the cattle, the geese, the flocks, all the       things\" which Xerxes had taken away from Kabbisha. The       expression passed into the language, as a word used to       express the condition of a subject race: \"I cause,\" said       Thutmosis III., \"Egypt to be a sovereign (_hirit_) to whom       all the earth is a slave\" (_miritu_).

The condition of the free agricultural labourer was in many respects  analogous to that of the modern fellah. Some of them possessed no other  property than a mud cabin, just large enough for a man and his wife,  and hired themselves out by the day or the year as farm servants. Others  were emboldened to lease land from the lord or from a soldier in the  neighbourhood. The most fortunate acquired some domain of which they  were supposed to receive only the product, the freehold of the property  remaining primarily in the hands of the Pharaoh, and secondarily in  that of lay or religious feudatories who held it of the sovereign: they  could, moreover, bequeath, give, or sell these lands and buy fresh ones  without any opposition. They paid, besides the capitation tax, a ground  rent proportionate to the extent of their property, and to the kind of  land of which it consisted.*         * The capitation tax, the ground rent, and the house duty of       the time of the Ptolemies, already existed under the rule of       the native Pharaohs. Brugsch has shown that these taxes are       mentioned in an inscription of the time of Ameuothes III.    It was not without reason that all the ancients attributed the invention  of geometry to the Egyptians. The perpetual encroachments of the Nile  and the displacements it occasioned, the facility with which it effaced  the boundaries of the fields, and in one summer modified the whole face  of a nome, had forced them from early times to measure with the greatest  exactitude the ground to which they owed their sustenance. The territory  belonging to each town and nome was subjected to repeated surveys made  and co-ordinated by the Royal Administration, thus enabling Pharaoh  to know the exact area of his estates. The unit of measurement was the  arura; that is to say, a square of a hundred cubits, comprising in  round numbers twenty-eight ares.* A considerable staff of scribes and  surveyors was continually occupied in verifying the old measurements  or in making fresh ones, and in recording in the State registers any  changes which might have taken place.** Each estate had its boundaries  marked out by a line of stelas which frequently bore the name of the  tenant at the time, and the date when the landmarks were last fixed.***         * [One \"are\" equals 100 square metres.--Tr.]         ** We learn from the expressions employed in the great       inscription of Beni-Hasan (11. 13--58, 131-148) that the       cadastral survey had existed from the very earliest times;       there are references in it to previous surveys. We find a       surveying scene on the tomb of Zosirkerisonbu at Thebes,       under the XVIIIth dynasty. Two persons are measuring a field       of wheat by means of a cord; a third notes down the result       of their work.         *** The great inscription of Beni-Hasan tells us of the       stelae which bounded the principality of the Gazelle on the       North and South, and of those in the plain which marked the       northern boundary of the nome of the Jackal; we also possess       three other stelo which were used by Amenothes IV. to       indicate the extreme limits of his new city of Khutniaton.       In addition to the above stele, we also know of two others       belonging to the XIIth dynasty which marked the boundaries       of a private estate, and which are reproduced, one on plate       106, the other in the text of _Monuments divers_, p. 30;       also the stele of Buhani under Thutmosis IV.    [Illustration: 125.jpg a boundary stele]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph given by Mariette,       Monuments divers, pl. 47 a. The stele marked the boundary of       the estate given to a priest of the Theban Amon by Pharaoh       Thutmosis IV. of the XVIIIth dynasty. The original is now in       the Museum at Gizeh.    Once set up, the stele received a name which gave it, as it were, a  living and independent personality. It sometimes recorded the nature  of the soil, its situation, or some characteristic which made it  remarkable--the \"Lake of the South,\" the \"Eastern Meadow,\" the \"Green  Island,\" the \"Fisher's Pool,\" the \"Willow Plot,\" the \"Vineyard,\" the  \"Vine Arbour,\" the \"Sycamore;\" sometimes also it bore the name of  the first master or the Pharaoh under whom it had been erected--the  \"Nurse-Phtahhotpu,\" the \"Verdure-Kheops,\" the \"Meadow-Didifri,\" the  \"Abundance-Sahuri,\" \"Khafri-Great-among-the Doubles.\" Once given, the  name clung to it for centuries, and neither sales, nor redistributions,  nor revolutions, nor changes of dynasty, could cause it to be forgotten.  The officers of the survey inscribed it in their books, together with  the name of the proprietor, those of the owners of adjoining lands,  and the area and nature of the ground. They noted down, to within a  few cubits, the extent of the sand, marshland, pools, canals, groups  of palms, gardens or orchards, vineyards and cornfields,* which it  contained.         * See in the great inscription of Beni-Hasan the passage in       which are enumerated at full length, in a legal document,       the constituent parts of the principality of the Gazelle,       \"its watercourses, its fields, its trees, its sands, from       the river to the mountain of the West\" (11. 46-53).    The cornland in its turn was divided into several classes, according to  whether it was regularly inundated, or situated above the highest rise  of the water, and consequently dependent on a more or less costly system  of artificial irrigation. All this was so much information of which the  scribes took advantage in regulating the assessment of the land-tax.    Everything tends to make us believe that this tax represented one-tenth  of the gross produce, but the amount of the latter varied. It depended  on the annual rise of the Nile, and it followed the course of it with  almost mathematical exactitude: if there were too much or too little  water, it was immediately lessened, and might even be reduced to nothing  in extreme cases. The king in his capital and the great lords in their  fiefs had set up nilo-meters, by means of which, in the critical weeks,  the height of the rising or subsiding flood was taken daily. Messengers  carried the news of it over the country: the people, kept regularly  informed of what was happening, soon knew what kind of season to expect,  and they could calculate to within very little what they would have to  pay. In theory, the collecting of the tax was based on the actual amount  of land covered by the water, and the produce of it was constantly  varying. In practice it was regulated by taking the average of preceding  years, and deducting from that a fixed sum, which was never departed  from except in extraordinary circumstances.*         * We know that this was so, in so far as the Roman period is       concerned, from a passage in the edict of Tiberius       Alexander. The practice was such a natural one, that I have       no hesitation in tracing it back to the time of the Ancient       Empire; repeatedly condemned as a piece of bad       administration, it reappeared continually. At Beni-Hasan,       the nomarch Amoni boasts that, \"when there had been abundant       Niles, and the owners of wheat and barley crops had thriven,       he had not increased the rate of the land-tax,\" which seems       to indicate that, so far as he was concerned, he had fixed       the tax to pay his dues without difficulty.    [Illustration: 128.jpg THE LEVYING OF THE TAX: THE TAXPAYER IN THE  SCRIBE'S OFFICE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a picture at Beni-Hasan. This       picture and those which follow it represent a census in the       principality of the Gazelle under the XIIth dynasty as well       as the collection of a tax.    The year would have to be a very bad one before the authorities would  lower the ordinary rate: the State in ancient times was not more willing  to deduct anything from its revenue than the modern State would be.*         * The two decrees of Rosetta and of Canopus, however,       mention reductions granted by the Ptolemies after an       insufficient rise of the Nile.    The payment of taxes was exacted in wheat, durra, beans, and field  produce, which were stored in the granaries of the nome. It would seem  that the previous deduction of one-tenth of the gross amount of the  harvest could not be a heavy burden, and that the wretched fellah ought  to have been in a position on land "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#19)"],[1,"district  surrounding it; the other cities recognized his authority, paid him  tribute, did homage to him in religious matters, and doubtless rendered  him military service also, but each one of them nevertheless maintained  its particular constitution and obeyed its hereditary lords. These  lords, it is true, lost their title of king, which now belonged  exclusively to their suzerain, and each one had to be content in his  district with the simple designation of \"vicegerent;\" but having once  fulfilled their feudal obligations, they had absolute power over  their ancient domains, and were able to transmit to their progeny the  inheritance they had received from their fathers. Gudea probably, and  most certainly his successors, ruled in this way over Lagash, as a fief  depending on the crown of Uru. After the manner of the Egyptian barons,  the vassals of the kings of Chaldaea submitted to the control of their  suzerain without resenting his authority as long as they felt the  curbing influence of a strong hand: but on the least sign of feebleness  in their master they reasserted themselves, and endeavoured to recover  their independence. A reign of any length was sure to be disturbed by  rebellions sometimes difficult to repress: if we are ignorant of any  such, it is owing to the fact that inscriptions hitherto discovered are  found upon objects upon which an account of a battle would hardly find  a fitting place, such as bricks from a temple, votive cones or cylinders  of terra-cotta, amulets or private seals. We are still in ignorance as  to Dungi's successors, and the number of years during which this first  dynasty was able to prolong its existence. We can but guess that its  empire broke up by disintegration after a period of no long duration.  Its cities for the most part became emancipated, and their rulers  proclaimed themselves kings once more. We see that the kingdom of  Amnanu, for instance, was established on the left bank of the Euphrates,  with Uruk as its capital, and that three successive sovereigns at  least--of whom Singashid seems to have been the most active--were able  to hold their own there. Uru had still, however, sufficient prestige and  wealth to make it the actual metropolis of the entire country. No one  could become the legitimate lord of Shumir and Accad before he had  been solemnly enthroned in the temple at Uru. For many centuries every  ambitious kinglet in turn contended for its possession and made it  his residence. The first of these, about 2500 B.C., were the lords  of Nishin, Libitanunit, Gamiladar, Inedin, Bursin I., and Ismidagan:  afterwards, about 2400 B.C., Gungunum of Nipur made himself master of  it. The descendants of Gungunum, amongst others Bursin II., Gimilsin,  Inesin, reigned gloriously for a few years. Their records show that  they conquered not only a part of Elam, but part of Syria. They were  dispossessed in their turn by a family belonging to Larsam, whose two  chief representatives, as far as we know, were Nurramman and his son  Sinidinnam (about 2300 B.C.). Naturally enough, Sinidinnam was a builder  or repairer of temples, but he added to such work the clearing of the  Shatt-el-Hai and the excavation of a new canal giving a more direct  communication between the Shatt and the Tigris, and in thus controlling  the water-system of the country became worthy of being considered one of  the benefactors of Chaldaea.    We have here the mere dust of history, rather than history itself: here  an isolated individual makes his appearance in the record of his name,  to vanish when we attempt to lay hold of him; there, the stem of a  dynasty which breaks abruptly off, pompous preambles, devout formulas,  dedications of objects or buildings, here and there the account of some  battle, or the indication of some foreign country with which relations  of friendship or commerce were maintained--these are the scanty  materials out of which to construct a connected narrative. Egypt has not  much more to offer us in regard to many of her Pharaohs, but we have in  her case at least the ascertained framework of her dynasties, in  which each fact and each new name falls eventually, and after some  uncertainty, into its proper place. The main outlines of the picture are  drawn with sufficient exactitude to require no readjustment, the groups  are for the most part in their fitting positions, the blank spaces or  positions not properly occupied are gradually restricted, and filled in  from day to day; the expected moment is in sight when, the arrangement  of the whole being accomplished, it will be necessary only to fill in  the details. In the case of Chaldaea the framework itself is wanting,  and expedients must be resorted to in order to classify the elements  entering into its composition. Naramsin is in his proper place, or  nearly so; but as for Gudea, what interval separates him from Naramsin,  and at what distance from Gudea are we to place the kings of Uru? The  beginnings of Chaldaea have merely a provisional history: the facts in  it are certain, but the connection of the facts with one another is too  often a matter of speculation. The arrangement which is put forward at  present can be regarded only as probable, but it would be difficult  to propose a better until the excavations have furnished us with fresh  material; it must be accepted merely as an attempt, without pledging to  it our confidence on the one hand, or regarding it with scepticism on  the other.

The cities of the Euphrates attract no attention, like those of the  Nile, by the magnificence of their ruins, which are witnesses,  even after centuries of neglect, to the activity of a powerful and  industrious people: on the contrary, they are merely heaps of rubbish in  which no architectural outline can be distinguished--mounds of stiff  and greyish clay, cracked by the sun, washed into deep crevasses by the  rain, and bearing no apparent traces of the handiwork of man.    [Illustration: 126.jpg PLAN OF THE RUINS OF WAKKA]    In the estimation of the Chaldaean architects, stone was a material of  secondary consideration: as it was necessary to bring it from a great  distance and at considerable expense, they used it very sparingly, and  then merely for lintels, uprights, thresholds, for hinges on which to  hang their doors, for dressings in some of their state apartments, in  cornices or sculptured friezes on the external walls of their buildings;  and even then its employment suggested rather that of a band of  embroidery carefully disposed on some garment to relieve the plainness  of the material. Crude brick, burnt brick, enamelled brick, but always  and everywhere brick was the principal element in their construction.  The soil of the marshes or of the plains, separated from the pebbles  and foreign substances which it contained, mixed with grass or chopped  straw, moistened with water, and assiduously trodden underfoot,  furnished the ancient builders with materials of incredible tenacity.  This was moulded into thin square bricks, eight inches to a foot across,  and three to four inches thick, but rarely larger: they were stamped on  the flat side, by means of"]]]
