Are you not going to marry her?\"    \"Certainly not--never thought of it for a moment.\"    \"Oh, dear, I must have made another mistake. Forgive me.\" She lay back  on her cushions.    \"Marie, when I get married, it's you I want for my wife. I have told you  that before, and I haven't changed my mind. You shall be mine, if you  will come back to the sweet days of long ago. Will you?\"    He leaned over the couch, and she drew his face to hers. \"Yes,\" she  whispered.    At the end of an hour's conversation wherein much had been said, Marie  asked: \"May I go with you to the temple and there help you in the work  you are doing? I believe I could help a little.\"    It was at that moment that the curtain lifted from the eyes of the  mortal, and Henrik saw for an instant into the pre-existent world. A  group of spiritual beings was eagerly engaged in conversation, and from  out that group he heard the voice of one answering Marie's question.    \"Yes; I think so; but we shall see.\"          XV.      \"A friend of mine in his journey is come to me.\"--_Luke 11:6._      The next time Henrik went to the valleys of the mountains in western  America, Marie accompanied him. They were married in the Temple, made  man and wife for time and eternity by the authority of the Priesthood.  That event was among their supremely happy ones. Rachel witnessed the  ceremony, and the smile on her face was sweeter than ever.    After that, Marie helped in the temple work as she had desired. The  three then labored together until Henrik's list of names was nearly  exhausted. After a very pleasant visit among friends, Henrik and Marie  went back to Norway and to Nordal. They made a new home from the ancient  one on the hillside by the forest, and for them the years went by in  peace and plenty. Sons and daughters came to them, to whom they taught  the gospel. In time many of his kin also believed the truth and  accepted it, and thus the seed that was sown in humility, and at first  brought but small returns, gave promise of a bounteous harvest.    Once every four or five years, Henrik and Marie visited the Saints in  the West, and spent some time in the temple. These were happy times for  Rachel, who continued to live alone, not making many intimate  acquaintances. Henrik was glad to provide for her simple necessities, so  that she could continue her life's work in behalf of the dead.    Rachel did not marry. Once in Minnesota, a young man had made love to  her, but she could not return that love, so she was in duty bound not to  encourage him. Rachel was hard to get acquainted with, a number of young  men had said. She was always happy and smiling, and yet a closer  knowledge of her character disclosed a serious strain that puzzled her  admirers--for Rachel had admirers. A number of times good men had been  about to make love to her in earnest, but each time some strange feeling  had checked them. The young woman was \"willing\" enough but what could  she do? There was without doubt a \"man\" for her, but she could not go in  search of him. As the years went by, and with them her youth and  somewhat of her beauty, she was often sad, and sometimes heart-hungry;  and at such times she found no peace until she had poured out her heart  to her heavenly Father, and said, \"Thy will be done--but make me  satisfied.\"    After an absence of three years Rachel visited her home in Minnesota.  She was received kindly, the parents being no doubt grateful that she  had escaped alive from the clutches of those \"terrible people\" whom she  had been among. She could still smile and be happy, be more patient than  ever, taking in good part the ridicule and sometimes the abuse directed  toward her. She talked on the gospel with those who would listen, and  after a time she found that she was making a little headway. Her father,  at the first, told her emphatically that she was not to \"preach her  religion\" in his house; but he would sometimes forget himself and ask  her a question, which in being answered would lead to a gospel  discourse. Then, awakening to what was going on, he would say, \"That  will do. I thought I told you that we wanted none of your preaching,\" at  which Rachel would smilingly look around to the others who were also  smiling at the father's inconsistencies.    During this visit the good seed was planted, from which in due time the  Lord gave an abundant harvest from among the Bogstad family and its many  ramifications.    One day in the temple Rachel met Signe Dahl Ames. It was Rachel's custom  to keep a lookout for sisters who were new to the work that she might  assist them. Signe had not been in the Temple since the day she was  married, and now she had come to do some work for her family. Rachel met  her in the outer room with a pleasant greeting.    \"I am Sister Bogstad,\" she said; \"and what is your name?\"    \"Bogstad, did you say--why--why, my name is Ames.\"    \"Yes, Bogstad,\" replied Rachel, noticing the sister's surprise. \"We  haven't met before, have we?\"    \"No; I think not. The name is not common, and I used to know a gentleman  by that name--that's all.\"    \"You're a Norwegian,\" said Rachel.    \"Yes.\"    \"So am I; though I was born in this country, it may be possible that I  belong to the family which you know.\"    \"I used to know Henrik Bogstad of Nordal, Norway.\"    \"That's my cousin. We have been doing work here in the temple.\"    Signe was greatly surprised, and Rachel led her to a corner where they  talked freely for some time. During the day they found occasion to  continue their conversation, and that evening Signe went home with her  new-found friend.    This was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Rachel knew enough of  Henrik's little romance with Signe to make the acquaintanceship  unusually interesting; besides, there came to be a strong affinity  between the two. Rachel accompanied her friend to Dry Bench, and there  soon became \"Aunt Rachel\" to Signe's four beautiful children. Then she  wrote to Henrik, telling him of her wonderful \"find.\" He replied that at  their next visit to America, they would surely give Dry Bench a call.    Henrik, Marie, and two of the older children came that fall when the  peaches were ripe and the alfalfa fields were being cut. And such  delicious peaches, and such stacks of fragrant hay they found! Amid the  beautiful setting of the harvest time, their several stories were told,  in wonder at the diverging and the meeting of the great streams of Life.  The Bogstad children practiced their book-learned English, while the  Ames children were willing teachers. The boys bathed in the irrigation  canal, rode on the loads of hay, and gorged themselves with peaches. The  girls played house under the trees. And were it part of this story, it  might be here told how that, later, Arnt Bogstad and Margaret Ames loved  and mated--but it is not.    Henrik and Marie lived happily together for twelve years, and then Marie  was called into the spirit world. Henrik was left with five children,  the youngest but a few months old. With ample means, he could obtain  plenty of household help, but money could not buy a mother for his  children. A number of years went by, bringing to Henrik new and varied  experiences. Then on one of his visits to the West he found another  helpmate for himself and children--a kind-hearted, sweet-souled young  woman, born of Danish parents, and reared among the Saints in the  valleys of the mountains. Then the westward call became so strong that  Henrik disposed of most of his interests in Norway and moved with his  family to America, taking up his abode in a town not far from Dry Bench.  Here they enjoyed the association of the Saints, and his children had  the advantage of companionship of children of the faith.    Time, and the world with it, sped on. Peace and prosperity came to the  people of this story. As years were added to years, their good works  increased, until the Lord said to each of them, Enough. Then in their  own time and place, they passed into the Paradise of God.          PART THIRD      Ye worlds of light and life, beyond our sphere;    Mysterious country! Let your light appear.    Ye angels, lift the veil, the truth unfold,    And give our seers a glimpse of that bright world;    Tell where ye live, and what is your employ,    Your present blessing, and your future joy.    Say, have you learned the name, and tuned the lyre,    And hymn'd the praise of Him--the great Messiah?    Have love's emotions kindled in your breast,    And hope, enraptured, seized the promised rest?    Or wait ye still the resurrection day,    That higher promise of Millenial sway?    When Saints and angels come to earth again,    And in the flesh with King Messiah reign?    The spirits answered as they soared away--    \"We're happy now, but wait a greater day,    When sin and death, and hell, shall conquered be,    And earth, with heaven enjoy the victory.\"      --_Parley P. Pratt._          I.      \"They shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit,    and shall be shut up in prison, and after many days shall they be    visited.\"--_Isaiah 24:22._      The Lord God created all things \"spiritually before they were naturally  upon the earth.\" He created \"every plant of the field before it was in  the earth, every herb of the field before it grew.\" Before this  \"natural\" creation \"there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in  the water, neither in the air;... but spiritually were they created and  made according\" to the word of God. In this second or \"natural\" creation  all things were clothed upon by earthly element, or in other words, the  spiritual was materialized so that it became discernible to the natural  senses. The spiritual and the natural are, therefore, but different  states of the same forms of life.

The _Chesapeake_, with a loss of 47 killed and  99 wounded to 24 killed and 59 wounded of the enemy, became the prize of  the _Shannon_.          CHAPTER XV.    David Porter--A Clever Feat--Numerous Captures by the _Essex_--Her  Remarkable Cruise in the Pacific--Her Final Capture.      David Porter was born in 1780 and died in 1842. He came from a seafaring  family, and, entering the navy at an early age, did gallant service in  the war with France and Tripoli. He was the father of David Dixon  Porter, who, on account of his brilliant record in the war for the  Union, was made vice-admiral in 1866 and admiral in 1870.    The elder Porter was appointed captain of the _Essex_ at the beginning  of the War of 1812, and, leaving New York, started on a cruise after the  British 36-gun _Thetis_, which was on her way to South America with a  large amount of specie aboard. She took several unimportant prizes, and,  failing to meet the _Thetis_, turned northward and on the night of July  10, 1812, sighted a fleet of merchantmen.    The night was cloudy and dark and Porter with a great deal of cleverness  pushed his way among the vessels without his identity being suspected.  He had drawn in his guns, hidden most of his men and done all he could  to give the _Essex_ the appearance of being an inoffensive merchantman.  His object was to learn whether the escort was too powerful to be  attacked. He opened conversation with the captain of one of the vessels,  who, unsuspicious of his identity, informed him that the fleet was  carrying a thousand soldiers from Barbados to Quebec, and that the  convoying vessel was the _Minerva_, a 32-gun frigate. In addition,  several of the merchantmen were heavily armed.    Captain Porter's next act was still more audacious. He glided forward  among the fleet and hailed the captain of a second vessel, but the  latter became suspicious, and was on the point of signalling to the  escort the appearance of a stranger among them, when Porter thrust out  the muzzles of twenty cannon and warned him that if he failed to keep  perfect silence and follow in his wake he would blow him out of the  water. The English captain obeyed, and Porter extricated his prize with  such astonishing skill that not a vessel took the alarm. When a safe  point was reached, Porter found that his prize was a brig with about two  hundred British soldiers on board.    Having succeeded so well, Porter again returned to the fleet for another  capture. But by this time day was breaking and the character of his  vessel was discovered. It being useless to attempt further disguise, he  cleared for action and offered the _Minerva_ battle. The captain,  however, deemed it his duty to remain with his convoy, and continued his  course to Quebec, while Porter headed southward, afterward restoring his  prize to its owners for a liberal ransom.    Captain Porter had become so clever in disguising his vessel as a  merchantman that some days later he lured the British 16-gun ship-sloop  _Alert_ to attack him. In the space of eight minutes the _Alert_ was so  helplessly crippled that her captain surrendered. The _Essex_ did not  suffer the slightest injury and no men were killed on either vessel.    The _Essex_ had now five hundred prisoners aboard, and they formed an  element of serious danger, for they began plotting among themselves to  capture the ship from the Americans and turn her over to the enemy.  Captain Porter was a severe disciplinarian, and one of his practices was  to have the alarm of fire sounded at all hours of the day or night, that  his crew might be taught the successful way of fighting the ever-present  danger. To make such training perfect, he occasionally started a fire in  the hatches.    The leader in the conspiracy to seize the ship fixed upon a night to  make the attempt, and his friends were on the alert to join him the  moment he gave the signal. In one of the hammocks was sleeping a  midshipmite only eleven years old, but, young as he was, he was a hero.  Pistol in hand, the plotter tiptoed up beside the hammock to learn  whether the boy was asleep. The little fellow was never wider awake in  his life; but he kept his eyes closed and breathed regularly, so as to  deceive the scoundrel, who slipped away to lead his companions in their  murderous uprising.    The instant the man disappeared the boy midshipman sprang out of his  hammock, crept to the cabin and told Captain Porter what he had seen.  That officer ran into the berth deck and loudly shouted \"_Fire_!\" The  finely disciplined crew promptly answered the call, and going to the  main hatch, were speedily armed and received their orders from Captain  Porter. The plotters were overawed and the rebellion nipped in the bud.    Thus the _Essex_ was saved by the wits of a boy only eleven years old.  The name of that boy was David Glasgow Farragut, and he became the  greatest naval officer of the American navy. Of course I shall have more  to tell you about him later on.    Determined to rid himself of the dangerous prisoners, Captain Porter  placed them on board the _Alert_ and sent them to Nova Scotia on parole.  In a cruise of sixty days he made nine captures, recaptured five  privateers and merchantmen, and arrived in the Delaware early in  September.    He sailed again in the latter part of October with the smallest frigate  in the navy, but with a full complement of officers and men. Among the  former, it need hardly be said, was young Midshipman Farragut. The first  port at which he stopped was Port Praya, where the Portuguese governor  showed them much courtesy. In December the _Essex_ crossed the equator,  and soon after overhauled a British brig of war, which strained every  effort to escape. The two manoeuvred for position, but the _Essex_  proved her superiority, and, after a volley of musketry, which killed  one man, the _Nocton_, as she proved to be, hauled down her flag. She  carried only 10 guns and 31 men, but had $50,000 in specie on board.  Captain Porter placed an officer and crew in charge of the prize, with  instructions to make the nearest American port. While striving to do so  he was captured by the British frigate _Belvidera_.    Captain Porter's instructions were to meet the _Constitution_ and  _Hornet_, which were cruising in that part of the world. He made  continued efforts to do so, and frequently got on their track, but  finally had to give it up. Then Captain Porter formed the bold plan of  doubling Cape Horn and entering the Pacific ocean.    This venture was more dangerous than would be supposed, for all the  South American countries on that side of the continent were dominated by  Great Britain, and in entering the vast expanse the American knew he  would meet plenty of enemies and not a solitary friend. Like an army  when it invades a country, however, he determined to live off the enemy.  He knew that scores of English vessels were in the Pacific, and all  Porter had to do was to capture them. He had had sufficient experience  at that sort of work to give him confidence, and he liked the business.    Unfortunately, it was the most dangerous season of the year for doubling  the Horn, which is always attended with peril. The _Essex_ was caught in  a tempest that lasted for three days, and was so terrific that the  stoutest hearted sailors quailed. The escape of the gallant little ship  could not have been narrower, and she suffered great damage, but finally  the dreaded extremity of South America was weathered, and in the  beginning of March, 1813, the _Essex_ sailed into the calmer water of  the Pacific, where no armed American vessel had ever before penetrated.    The first halt was made off the island of Mocha, where a hunting party  secured a number of hogs, which were salted down for future use.  Captain Porter wished to keep secret his presence in that part of the  world until after he had secured a number of prizes, but the condition  of his vessel compelled him to put into Valparaiso, where he learned  that Chili had begun her war of independence against Spain.    A sail which was sighted displayed the Spanish colors, and, believing  her to be one of the vessels that had been preying upon American  commerce in the Pacific, Captain Porter hoisted the British flag. The  stranger approached and sent an armed boat to the _Essex_. It was  immediately sent back with orders for the Peruvian cruiser to come under  the lee of the _Essex_. This was done, and she was compelled to strike.  Upon the demand of Porter, her captain gave a list of all the vessels,  so far as he could remember, that were cruising in the Pacific. Then the  arms, ammunition and spars of the captive were thrown overboard and she  was allowed to go.    From that time forward the captures made by the _Essex_ were so numerous  that the full story would be monotonous. The swiftest and best of the  captured cruisers were fitted out with crews and added to the American  vessel, until Captain Porter had under his command seven ships, carrying  80 guns and 340 men, in addition to nearly a hundred prisoners. Still  more were added, and the cruise of the _Essex_ and her companions in  that part of the world became very much like a picnic.    A number of powerful British frigates were searching for the _Essex_,  which had wrought such prodigious mischief. Porter sailed for the  Marquesas Islands, reaching them in the latter part of October. There he  landed, built a fort and made the repairs of which his vessel stood in  sore need.    The work accomplished by Captain Porter was almost beyond computation.  He literally destroyed English commerce in the Pacific, for none of the  vessels not captured dared leave"]]]
