Christian, Esq., a merchant of Richmond. From this  gentleman, James had the folly to flee.    Passing hurriedly over interesting details, received from him respecting  his remarkable history, two or three more incidents too good to omit  must suffice.    \"How did you like Mr. Tyler?\" said an inquisitive member of the  Vigilance Committee. \"I didn't like Mr. Tyler much,\" was the reply.  \"Why?\" again inquired the member of the Committee. \"Because Mr. Tyler  was a poor man. I never did like poor people. I didn't like his marrying  into our family, who were considered very far Tyler's superiors.\" \"On  the plantation,\" he said, \"Tyler was a very cross man, and treated the  servants very cruelly; but the house servants were treated much better,  owing to their having belonged to his wife, who protected them from  persecution, as they had been favorite servants in her father's family.\"  James estimated that \"Tyler got about thirty-five thousand dollars and  twenty-nine slaves, young and old, by his wife.\"    What prompted James to leave such pleasant quarters? It was this: He had  become enamored of a young and respectable free girl in Richmond, with  whom he could not be united in marriage solely because he was a slave,  and did not own himself. The frequent sad separations of such married  couples (where one or the other was a slave) could not be overlooked;  consequently, the poor fellow concluded that he would stand a better  chance of gaining his object in Canada than by remaining in Virginia. So  he began to feel that he might himself be sold some day, and thus the  resolution came home to him very forcibly to make tracks for Canada.    In speaking of the good treatment he had always met with, a member of  the Committee remarked, \"You must be akin to some one of your master's  family?\" To which he replied, \"I am Christian's son.\" Unquestionably  this passenger was one of that happy class so commonly referred to by  apologists for the \"Patriarchal Institution.\" The Committee, feeling a  deep interest in his story, and desiring great success to him in his  Underground efforts to get rid of slavery, and at the same time possess  himself of his affianced, made him heartily welcome, feeling assured  that the struggles and hardships he had submitted to in escaping, as  well as the luxuries he was leaving behind, were nothing to be compared  with the blessings of liberty and a free wife in Canada.             *       *       *       *       *          EDWARD MORGAN, HENRY JOHNSON, JAMES AND STEPHEN BUTLER.            \"TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.--The above Reward will be paid for      the apprehension of two blacks, who escaped on Sunday last. It      is supposed they have made their way to Pennsylvania. $500 will      be paid for the apprehension of either, so that we can get them      again. The oldest is named Edward Morgan, about five feet six or      seven inches, heavily made--is a dark black, has rather a down      look when spoken to, and is about 21 years of age.        \"Henry Johnson is a colored negro, about five feet seven or      eight inches, heavily made, aged nineteen years, has a pleasant      countenance, and has a mark on his neck below the ear.        \"Stephen Butler is a dark-complexioned negro, about five feet      seven inches; has a pleasant countenance, with a scar above his      eye; plays on the violin; about twenty-two years old.        \"Jim Butler is a dark-complexioned negro, five feet eight or      nine inches; is rather sullen when spoken to; face rough; aged      about twenty-one years. The clothing not recollected. They had      black frock coats and slouch hats with them. Any information of      them address Elizabeth Brown, Sandy Hook P.O., or of Thomas      Johnson, Abingdon P.O., Harford county, Md.        \"ELIZABETH BROWN.        \"THOMAS JOHNSON.\"          FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORDS.      The following memorandum is made, which, if not too late, may afford  some light to \"Elizabeth Brown and Thomas Johnson,\" if they have not  already gone the way of the \"lost cause\"--    _June_ 4, 1857.--Edward is a hardy and firm-looking young man of  twenty-four years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and  \"likely,\"--would doubtless bring $1,400 in the market. He had been held  as the property of the widow, \"Betsy Brown,\" who resided near Mill Green  P.O., in Harford county, Md. \"She was a very bad woman; would go to  church every Sunday, come home and go to fighting amongst the colored  people; was never satisfied; she treated my mother very hard, (said  Ed.); would beat her with a walking-stick, &c. She was an old woman and  belonged to the Catholic Church. Over her slaves she kept an overseer,  who was a very wicked man; very bad on colored people; his name was  'Bill Eddy;' Elizabeth Brown owned twelve head.\"    Henry is of a brown skin, a good-looking young man, only nineteen years  of age, whose prepossessing appearance would insure a high price for him  in the market--perhaps $1,700. With Edward, he testifies to the meanness  of Mrs. Betsy Brown, as well as to his own longing desire for freedom.  Being a fellow-servant with Edward, Henry was a party to the plan of  escape. In slavery he left his mother and three sisters, owned by the  \"old woman\" from whom he escaped.    James is about twenty-one years of age, full black, and medium size. As  he had been worked hard on poor fare, he concluded to leave, in company  with his brother and two cousins, leaving his parents in slavery, owned  by the \"Widow Pyle,\" who was also the owner of himself. \"She was upwards  of eighty, very passionate and ill-natured, although a member of the  Presbyterian Church.\" James may be worth $1,400.    Stephen is a brother of James', and is about the same size, though a  year older. His experience differed in no material respect from his  brother's; was owned by the same woman, whom he \"hated for her bad  treatment\" of him. Would bring $1,400, perhaps.    In substance, and to a considerable extent in the exact words, these  facts are given as they came from the lips of the passengers, who,  though having been kept in ignorance and bondage, seemed to have their  eyes fully open to the wrongs that had been heaped upon them, and were  singularly determined to reach free soil at all hazards. The Committee  willingly attended to their financial and other wants, and cheered them  on with encouraging advice.    They were indebted to \"The Baltimore Sun\" for the advertisement  information. And here it may be further added, that the \"Sun\" was quite  famous for this kind of U.G.R.R. literature, and on that account alone  the Committee subscribed for it daily, and never failed to scan closely  certain columns, illustrated with a black man running away with a bundle  on his back. Many of these popular illustrations and advertisements were  preserved, many others were sent away to friends at a distance, who took  a special interest in the U.G.R.R. matters. Friends and stockholders in  England used to take a great interest in seeing how the fine arts, in  these particulars, were encouraged in the South (\"the land of  chivalry\").             *       *       *       *       *          HENRY PREDO.      BROKE JAIL, JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE.      Henry fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., Md., March, 1857. Physically  he is a giant. About 27 years of age, stout and well-made, quite black,  and no fool, as will appear presently. Only a short time before he  escaped, his master threatened to sell him south. To avoid that fate,  therefore, he concluded to try his luck on the Underground Rail Road,  and, in company with seven others--two of them females--he started for  Canada. For two or three days and nights they managed to outgeneral all  their adversaries, and succeeded bravely in making the best of their way  to a Free State.    In the meantime, however, a reward of $3,000 was offered for their  arrest. This temptation was too great to be resisted, even by the man  who had been intrusted with the care of them, and who had faithfully  promised to pilot them to a safe place. One night, through the treachery  of their pretended conductor, they were all taken into Dover Jail, where  the Sheriff and several others, who had been notified beforehand by the  betrayer, were in readiness to receive them. Up stairs they were taken,  the betrayer remarking as they were going up, that they were \"cold, but  would soon have a good warming.\" On a light being lit they discovered  the iron bars and the fact that they had been betrayed. Their  liberty-loving spirits and purposes, however, did not quail. Though  resisted brutally by the sheriff with revolver in hand, they made their  way down one flight of stairs, and in the moment of excitement, as good  luck would have it, plunged into the sheriff's private apartment, where  his wife and children were sleeping. The wife cried murder lustily. A  shovel full of fire, to the great danger of burning the premises, was  scattered over the room; out of the window jumped two of the female  fugitives. Our hero Henry, seizing a heavy andiron, smashed out the  window entire, through which the others leaped a distance of twelve  feet. The railing or wall around the jail, though at first it looked  forbidding, was soon surmounted by a desperate effort.    At this stage of the proceedings, Henry found himself without the walls,  and also lost sight of his comrades at the same time. The last enemy he  spied was the sheriff in his stockings without his shoes. He snapped his  pistol at him, but it did not go off. Six of the others, however,  marvellously got off safely together; where the eighth went, or how he  got off, was not known.             *       *       *       *       *          DANIEL HUGHES.

I make my honey        Good and strong.        I fly about        To every flower      And sometimes stay        'Most half an hour.\"    Uncle Wiggily didn't know whether or not the bee was really in earnest  about what he said, but, surely enough, when they got to the ice cream  store, the man took the bee's honey, and handed out four ice cream cones,  each larger than the first ones. Two were for the duck as he was so fond  of them.    \"Oh, let's eat them here, so that if the bear meets us he can't take them  away,\" suggested Grandfather Goosey, and they did. Then the bee flew home  to his hive, and Uncle Wiggily and the old gentleman duck found a nice  place to sleep under a haystack.    In the morning Grandfather Goosey said he thought he had better go back  home, as he had traveled enough. He wanted the rabbit to come with him,  but Uncle Wiggily said:    \"No, I have not yet found my fortune, and until I do I will keep on  traveling.\" So he kept on, and the duck went home.    Well, it was about two days after that when, along toward evening, as  Uncle Wiggily was walking down the road, he saw a real big house standing  beside a lake. Oh, it was a very big house, about as big as a mountain,  and the chimney on it was so tall as almost to reach the sky.    \"Hum! I wonder who lives there?\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"Perhaps I can find  my fortune in that house.\"    \"Oh, no; never go there!\" cried a voice down on the ground, and, looking  toward his toes, Uncle Wiggily saw a little red ant.    \"Ah, ha! Why shouldn't I go up to the big house, little red ant?\" asked  the rabbit.    \"Because a monstrous giant lives there,\" was the answer, \"and he could eat  you up at one mouthful. So stay away.\"    \"I guess I will,\" said the rabbit. \"But I wonder where I can sleep  to-night. I guess I'll go----\"    \"Oh, look out! Look out!\" cried another red ant. \"There is the giant  coming now.\"    Uncle Wiggily looked, and he saw something like a big tree moving, and  that was the giant. Then he felt the ground trembling as if a railroad  train was rumbling past, and he heard a noise like thunder, and that was  the giant walking and speaking:    \"I smell rabbits! I smell rabbits!\" cried the giant. \"I must have them for  supper!\" Then he came on straight to where Uncle Wiggily was, but he  hadn't yet seen him.    \"Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?\" cried the bunny. \"Let me hide  behind that stone.\" He made a jump for a rock, taking his valise and  crutch with him, but the first red ant said:    \"It is no good hiding there, Uncle Wiggily, for the giant can see you.\"    \"Oh, what shall I do?\" he asked again, trembling with fear.    \"I know!\" cried the second little red ant. \"Let's all bring grains of  sand, and cover Uncle Wiggily up, leaving just a little hole for his nose,  so he can breathe. Then the giant won't see him. It will be like down at  the seashore, when they cover people on the beach up with the sand.\"    \"Oh, it will take many grains of sand to cover the rabbit,\" said the first  red ant, but still they were not discouraged. The first two ants called  their brothers and sisters, and aunts, and uncles, and papas, and mammas,  and cousins, and nephews, and forty-second granduncles. Soon there were  twenty-two million four hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred  and ninety-one ants, and a little baby ant, who counted as a half a one,  and he carried baby grains of dirt.    Then each big ant took up a grain of sand, and then they all hurried up,  and put them on Uncle Wiggily, who stretched out in the grass. Now all  those ants together could carry lots of sand, you see, and soon the rabbit  was completely buried from sight, all but the tip of his nose, so he could  breathe, and when the giant came rumbling, stumbling by, he couldn't see  the bunny, and so he didn't eat him. And, of course, the giant didn't eat  the ants, either for he didn't like them.    \"Hum! I thought I smelled a rabbit, but I guess I was mistaken,\" said the  giant, grumbling and growling, as he tramped around.    And that's how Uncle Wiggily was saved, and pretty soon, if there isn't  any sand in my rice pudding, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the bad  giant.          STORY XXVIII    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BAD GIANT      Do you remember about the giant, of whom I told you a little while ago,  and how he couldn't find Uncle Wiggily, because the rabbit was covered  with sand that the ants carried? Yes, I guess you do remember. Well, now  I'm going to tell you what that giant did.    At first he was real surprised, because he couldn't find the bunny-rabbit,  and he tramped around, making the ground shake with his heavy steps, and  growling in his rumbling voice until you would have thought that it was  thundering.    \"My, my!\" growled the giant. \"To think that I can't have a rabbit supper  after all. Oh, I'm so hungry that I could eat fourteen thousand, seven  hundred and eighty-seven rabbits, and part of another one. But I guess  I'll have to take a barrel of milk and a wagon load of crackers for my  supper.\"    So that's what he did, and my how much he ate!    Well, after the giant had gone away, Uncle Wiggily crawled out from under  the sand, and he said to the ants:    \"I guess I'd better not stay around here, for it is too dangerous. I'll  never find my fortune here, and if that giant were to see me he'd step on  me, and make me as flat as a sheet of paper. I'm going.\"    \"But wait,\" said the biggest ant of all. \"You know there are two giants  around here. One is a good one, and one is bad. Now if you go to the good  giant I'm sure he will help you find your fortune.\"    \"I'll try it,\" said the rabbit. \"Where does the good giant live?\"    \"Just up the hill, in that house where you see the flag,\" said the big  ant, as she ate two crumbs of bread and jam. \"That's where the good giant  lives. You must go where you see the fluttering flag, and you may find  your fortune.\"    \"I will,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"I'll go in the morning, the first thing  after breakfast.\"    So the next morning he started off. But in the night something had  happened and the rabbit didn't know a thing about it. After dark the bad  giant got up, and he went over, and took the flag from the pole in front  of the house of the good giant, and hoisted it up over his own house.    \"I haven't any flag of my own,\" said the bad giant, \"so I will take his.\"  For you see, the two giants lived not far apart. In fact they were  neighbors, but they were very different, one from the other, for one was  kind and the other was cruel.    So it happened, that when Uncle Wiggily started to go to the giant's house  he looked for the fluttering flag, and when he saw it on the bad giant's  house he didn't know any better, but he thought it was the home of the  good giant.    Well, the old gentleman rabbit walked on and on, having said good-by to  the ants, and pretty soon he was right close to the bad giant's house.  But, all the while, he thought it was the good giant's place--so don't  forget that.    \"I wonder what sort of a fortune he'll give me,\" thought the rabbit. \"I  hope I soon get rich, so I can stop traveling, for I am tired.\"    Well, as he came near the place where the bad giant lived he heard a voice  singing. And the song, which was sung in a deep, gruff, grumbling,  growling voice, went something like this:        \"Oh, bing bang, bung!      Look out of the way for me.        For I'm so mad,        I feel so bad,      I could eat a hickory tree!        Oh, snip, snap, snoop!      Get off my big front stoop,        Or I'll tear my hair        In wild despair,      And burn you with hot soup!\"    \"My, that's a queer song for a good giant to sing,\" thought Uncle Wiggily.  \"But perhaps he just sings that for fun. I'm sure I'll find him a jolly  enough fellow, when I get to know him.\"    Well, he went on a little farther, and pretty soon he came to the gate of  the castle where the bad giant lived. The rabbit looked about, and saw no  one there, so he kept right on, until, all of a sudden, he felt as if a  big balloon had swooped down out of the sky, and had lifted him up. Higher  and higher he went, until he found himself away up toward the roof of the  castle, and then he looked and he saw two big fingers, about as big as a  trolley car, holding him just as you would hold a bug.    \"Oh, who has me?\" cried Uncle Wiggily, very much frightened. \"Let me go,  please. Who are you?\"    \"I am the bad giant,\" was the answer, \"and if I let you go now you'd fall  to the ground and be killed. So I'll hold on to you.\"    \"Are you the bad giant?\" asked the rabbit. \"Why, I thought I was coming  to the good giant's house. Oh, please let me go!\"    \"No, I'm going to keep you,\" said the giant. \"I just took the good giant's  flag to fool you. Now, let me see, I think I'll just sprinkle sugar on you  and eat you all up--no, I'll use salt--no, I think pepper would be better;  I feel like pepper to-day.\"    So the bad giant started toward the cupboard to get the pepper caster, and  poor Uncle Wiggily thought it was all up with him.    \"Oh, I wish I'd never thought of coming to see any giant, good or bad,\"  the rabbit gentleman said. \"Now good-by to all my friends!\"    \"Hum! Let me see,\" spoke the bad giant, standing still. \"Pepper--no, I  think I'll put some mustard on you--no, I'll try ketchup--no, I mean  horseradish. Oh, dear, I can't seem to make up my mind what to flavor you  with,\" and he held Uncle Wiggily there in his fingers, away up about a  hundred feet high in the air, and wondered what he'd do with the old  gentleman rabbit.    And it's a good thing he didn't eat him right away, for that was the means  of saving Uncle Wiggily's life. Right after breakfast the good giant found  out that his bad neighbor had taken his flag, so he went and told the ants  all about it.    \"Oh, then Uncle Wiggily must have been mixed up about the"]]]
