'The  ways unto God are as the number of the breaths of [His] creatures' is a  mysterious truth, and 'To every [people] We have appointed a [separate]  rite'(50) is one of the subtleties of the Qur'an. If this vast energy and  precious time which have been expended in persecuting other religions, and  whereby no sort of result or effect has been obtained, had been spent in  strengthening the basis of the monarchy, fortifying the imperial throne,  making prosperous the realms of the sovereign, and quickening the subjects  of the king, ere now the royal dominions would have become prosperous, the  seed-plot of the people would have been watered by the bounty of princely  justice, and the splendor of the kingdom of Persia would be evident and  apparent as the true dawn throughout the horizons of the world.\"    These questions and considerations, at all events, certain persons have  reported. But let us return to our original subject. The Royal Personage  was pleased to investigate the hidden secret in his own noble person.  According to the account transmitted, it became clear and obvious before  the [Royal] Presence that most of these suspicions arose from the  intrigues of persons of influence who were continually engaged in  fabricating matters behind the veil of fancy and casting suspicion upon  the community, and who, to attain advantages for themselves and preserve  their own positions, were wont to make motes appear as globes, and straws  as mountains in the mirror of their imagination. For these suspicions  there was absolutely no foundation or basis, nor had these assertions any  proof or verisimilitude. What power and ability have the helpless people,  or what boldness and strength have poor subjects that they should inflict  injury or hurt on the sovereign might, or be able to oppose the military  forces of the crown?    From that time till now disturbance and sedition have been on the wane in  Persia, and clamor and strife have ceased; although [still] on rare  occasions certain of the official doctors do, for their own personal and  private advantage, stir up the common folk, raise a hue and cry, and, by  their importunity and pertinacity, molest one or two individuals of this  sect, as happened ten or twelve years ago in Isfahan. For there were  amongst the inhabitants of Isfahan two brothers, Siyyids of Tabataba,  Siyyid Hasan and Siyyid Husayn, celebrated in those parts for piety,  trustworthiness, and nobility; men of wealth, engaged in commerce,  behaving towards all men with perfect kindliness and courtesy. And to all  outward appearance no one had observed in either of these two brothers any  swerving from what was best, much less any conduct or behavior which could  deserve torment or punishment; for, as is related, they were admitted by  all [preeminent] in all praiseworthy and laudable qualities, while their  deeds and actions were like exhortations and admonitions. These had  transacted business with Mir Muhammad Husayn the Imam-Jum'ih of Isfahan;  and when they came to make up their accounts it appeared that the sum of  eighteen thousand tumans was due to them. They [therefore] broke off  [further] transactions, prepared a bond for this sum, and desired it to be  sealed. This thing was grievous to the Imam-Jum'ih, so that he came to the  stage of anger and enmity. Finding himself in debt, and having no recourse  but to pay, he raised clamor and outcry saying \"These two brothers are  Babis and deserve severe punishment from the king.\" A crowd at once  attacked their house, plundered and pillaged all their goods, distressed  and terrified their wives and children, and seized and despoiled all their  possessions. Then, fearing that they might refer the punishment to the  step of the king's throne and loose their tongues in demand of redress, he  [i.e., the Imam-Jum'ih] fell to thinking how to compass their death and  destroy them. He therefore persuaded certain of the doctors to cooperate  with him, and they pronounced sentence of death. Afterwards they arrested  those two brothers, put them in chains, and brought them before the public  assembly. Yet seek as they might to fix on them some accusation, find some  fault, or discover some pretext, they were unable to do so. At length they  said, \"You must either renounce this faith, or else lay down your heads  beneath the sword of punishment.\" Although some of those present urged  them saying, \"Say merely 'We are not of this sect,' and it is sufficient,  and will be the means of your deliverance and protection,\" they would by  no means consent, but rather confirmed and declared it with eloquent  speech and affecting utterance, so that the rage and violence of the  Imam-Jum'ih boiled over, and, not satisfied with killing and destroying  them, they inflicted sundry indignities on their bodies after death to  mention which is not fitting, and of which the details are beyond the  power of speech. Indeed in such wise was the blood of these two brothers  shed that even the Christian priest of Julfa cried out, lamented, and wept  on that day; and this event befell after such sort that everyone wept over  the fate of those two brothers, for during the whole period of their life  they had never distressed the feelings even of an ant, while by general  report they had in the time of the famine in Persia spent all their wealth  in relieving the poor and distressed. Yet, notwithstanding this  reputation, were they slain with such cruelty in the midst of the people!    But now for a long while the justice of the King has prevented and  withheld, and none dares attempt such grievous molestations.

I have written answers to the letters which thou hast sent and I enclose  them with this Tablet. I wrote also a Tablet to the assembly(56) ; read it  unto them with a fluent tongue and a heart overflowing with the love of  God.          \"O ye who have advanced! O ye who are rejoiced!...\"      O ye(57) who have advanced! O ye who are rejoiced!    Verily, God hath, through His grace and generosity, guided you toward His  Kingdom, hath facilitated unto you every good, hath favored you with the  bounty of guidance, hath made you signs of piety, hath caused a blessing  to descend upon you from heaven, and hath made you banners of His  commemoration among mankind.    Thank ye God for this gift, by reason of which the hearts of the Supreme  Concourse are exhilarated. The fragrances of holiness shall soon be  diffused and the breeze of grace shall blow from the direction of the  providence of your Lord, whereby your mentioning will be exalted, your  light will become scintillating, your backs will be strengthened and you  joy will be perfected.    Make you feet firm in the love of God, arise to carry on the teachings of  God, purify souls from desire and illumine faces with the light of  guidance; so that ye may obtain the might gift and the great mercy.          \"O ye sincere ones and ye who are attracted and moved...\"      O ye(58) sincere ones and ye who are attracted and moved by the breeze of  the favor of God!    Verily, I have read the names of your beloved assembly which deserves to  be mentioned with sanctity and which attracts the confirmation of the  loving Lord and seeks to attain to the favors of God, the Mighty, the  Compassionate!    I beseech God at all times, with all supplication, humility and lowliness,  to confirm these souls who have no purpose in their deliberation and  consultations save to seek the merciful bounties and the divine invisible  confirmations.    I hope and request, through the bounty of my Lord, that the greatest  assistance and the most eminent confirmation be granted unto you when ye  are firm and steadfast and withstand every difficulty which may befall you  in spreading the Cause of God in those regions.    By the life of God, all the confirmations of the Kingdom of God will  surround those whose hearts are firm, whose feet are steadfast and whose  souls are tranquilized in the Most Great Cause.    Consider ye the past centuries, how a single one of the beloved of God  withstood all the people on the earth because of his firmness in the love  of God, and his entire turning of the heart toward the Kingdom of God and  with the cup of his heart overflowing with the wine of the knowledge of  God.    Be ye assured with the greatest assurance that, verily, God will help  those who are firm in His Covenant in every matter, through His  confirmation and favor, the lights of which will shine forth unto the east  of the earth, as well as the west thereof. He will make them the signs of  guidance among the creation and as shining and glittering stars from all  horizons.    Consequently, do ye beseech unto God and pray and supplicate Him and ask  Him for the greatest gift and eminent favor.          \"O thou who hast acknowledged the Kingdom of God!...\"      O thou who hast acknowledged the Kingdom of God!    I received thy letter wherein thou hast confessed the appearance of the  Kingdom of God at this time, declared His Oneness and believed in His  Words. Blessed art thou for this clear confession! Thank the maid-servant  of God .............. for she hath guided thee to this Path and declared  to thee the Call of God. Shouldst thou offer all the treasures of the  earth to her, they would not equal this great guidance.    Depend upon God, be sincere and sever thyself from all else save Him. Thus  thou wilt receive the teaching of God and thy heart will be made happy.  May thy tongue praise Him and thy sight behold the light shining from the  Sun of Truth.    Verily, this is a rich blessing for which the saints of the past longed.  Be happy and say: \"God chooses for His favors whomsoever He willeth. He is  the Merciful, the Generous!\"          \"O ye who are set aglow with the fire of God's Love!...\"      O ye who are set aglow with the fire of God's Love!    Blessed are ye for having been chosen by God for His love, in this new  age, and joy be to you for having been guided to the Great Kingdom!  Verily, your Lord hath chosen you to show the path to the Kingdom of God,  among the people. The attracted maid-servant of God, ............ praised  you in beautiful expressions and informed me of your earnest endeavors in  serving, teaching and offering the chalice of Truth to the maid-servants  of God. I rejoiced to hear of your efforts in the Cause of God. This is  indeed good service.          \"O thou who art turning unto God!...\"      O thou who art turning unto God!    Thy letter was an inheritance of joy and happiness unto me, for its  significance was a supplication and an entreaty unto God to make thee a  pure servant, exempt from all material desires, sanctified and severed  from all save God, that thou mayest be characterized with the attributes  of the heavenly angels, cleansed from all desires and earthly wishes, with  thy heart severed from all save the knowledge of the divine teachings.  Verily, I pray God to nourish thee upon the breast of bounty and rear thee  in such a manner that all men of learning shall be amazed, and to make  thee a miracle of guidance among the servants.          \"O thou who art attracted to God!...\"      O thou who art attracted to God!    I send this letter written by my own hand, that thou mayest thank God, thy  Lord, the Supreme, grow in happiness in the love of God and be kindled by  the fire of His love, chanting verses of greetings and thanks, and be  quickened by the breezes of life blown from the garden of the knowledge of  God.          \"O thou opened rose in the garden of El-ABHA!...\"      O thou opened rose in the garden of El-ABHA!    I have perused thy excellently worded letter showing what is moving in thy  heart by the emotions of the love of God.    O maid-servant of God! Chant the Words of God and, pondering over their  meaning, transform them into actions! I ask God to cause thee to attain a  high station in the Kingdom of Life forever and ever.          \"O thou who art tested with a great calamity!...\"      O thou who art tested with a great calamity!    Be not grieved nor troubled because of the loss which hath befallen thee--a  loss which caused the tears to flow, sighs to be produced, sorrow to exist  and hearts to burn in great agony; but know, this hath reference only to  the physical body, and if thou considerest this matter with a discerning  and intelligent eye, thou wilt find that it hath no power whatsoever, for  separation belongeth to the characteristics of the body. But concerning  the spirit, know that thy pure son shall be with thee in the Kingdom of  God and thou shalt witness his smiling face, illumined brow, handsome  spirit and real happiness. Accordingly, thou wilt then be comforted and  thank God for His favor upon thee.          \"O thou who art patient and resigning thyself to the...\"      O thou who art patient and resigning thyself to the judgment (of God)!    Be not grieved at the calamity which hath unexpectedly come upon thee and  for the misfortune which heavily weigheth upon thee. It behooveth one like  thee to endure every trial, to be pleased with the decree and to commit  all thy affairs to God, so that thou mayest be a calm, approved and  pleasing soul before God. Know thou, that thy beloved son hath soared,  with the wing of soul, up to the loftiest height which is never-ending in  the Kingdom of God. Rejoice at this great prosperity which the chosen ones  were longingly asking from the Holy and Exalted Threshold (of God). Truly,  I say unto thee, wert thou informed of the position in which is thy son,  thy face would be illuminated by the lights of happiness and thou wouldst  thank thy forgiving Lord therefor and thou wouldst long for ascending to  that praiseworthy position.          \"O thou who hast humbled thyself before the Kingdom...\"      O thou who hast humbled thyself before the Kingdom of God!    Blessed art thou that thine heart is attracted to the Beauty of God, is  illumined with the light of knowledge and the ray of the Kingdom hath  shone within it.    Know thou, verily, God is with thee under all circumstances and guards  thee from the concerns of the world and makes thee a servant in His great  vineyard.    As to thy question concerning training children: It is incumbent upon thee  to nurture them from the breast of the love of God, to urge them towards  spiritual matters, to turn unto God and to acquire good manners, best  characteristics and praiseworthy virtues and qualities in the world of  humanity, and to study sciences with the utmost diligence; so that they  may become spiritual, heavenly and attracted to the fragrances of sanctity  from their childhood and be reared in a religious, spiritual and heavenly  training. Verily, I beg of God to confirm them therein.    As to thy revered husband: It is expedient that thou shouldst behave  toward him in the best way and persevere in his good pleasure (i.e.,  please him) and treat him with kindness under all aspects; until (or so  that) he may find that through thy turning toward the Kingdom of God  (i.e., by becoming a believer) thy affection toward him and thy love for  God is increased and that thou hast regard for his good will in every  condition.    Verily, I beg of God to make"]]]
