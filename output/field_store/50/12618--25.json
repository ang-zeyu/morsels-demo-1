Though these images are considerably later than the Mahavagga and  prove nothing as to the _original_ practice of the Sangha, yet they  show that the Ekamsika fashion prevailed at a relatively early  period. It now prevails in Siam and partly in Ceylon. I-Ching (chap.  XI.) has a discussion on the way robes were worn in India (_c._ 680  A.D.) which is very obscure but seems to say that monks may keep their  shoulders covered while in a monastery but should uncover one when  they go out.]    [Footnote 164: _Sasanav._ p. 123.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685"],[0,"The Mystery of the Yellow Room (#19)"],[1,"ation. Let us  go over the moments which followed after the crime had been committed.  There was the first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques  were close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was the second  moment, during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson  was left alone before the door. There was a third moment, when Monsieur  Stangerson was joined by the concierge. There was a fourth moment,  during which Monsieur Stangerson, the concierge and his wife and Daddy  Jacques were before the door. There was a fifth moment, during which the  door was burst open and The Yellow Room entered. The moment at which the  flight is explainable is the very moment when there was the least number  of persons before the door. There was one moment when there was but one  person,--Monsieur Stangerson. Unless a complicity of silence on the part  of Daddy Jacques is admitted--in which I do not believe--the door was  opened in the presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man escaped.    \"Here we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons for  not arresting, or not causing the arrest of the murderer, since he  allowed him to reach the window in the vestibule and closed it after  him!--That done, Mademoiselle Stangerson, though horribly wounded, had  still strength enough, and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of  her father, to refasten the door of her chamber, with both the bolt and  the lock, before sinking on the floor. We do not know who committed  the crime; we do not know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle  Stangerson are the victims, but there is no doubt that they both know!  The secret must be a terrible one, for the father had not hesitated  to leave his daughter to die behind a door which she had shut upon  herself,--terrible for him to have allowed the assassin to escape. For  there is no other way in the world to explain the murderer's flight from  The Yellow Room!\"    The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation was  appalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor,  driven into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan, forced  to confess the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep silent, and thus  make a yet more terrible admission. The man himself, a veritable statue  of sorrow, raised his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our  heads to it as before something sacred. He then pronounced these words,  in a voice so loud that it seemed to exhaust him:    \"I swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an instant  left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for help; that  that door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory; and that,  finally, when we entered The Yellow Room, my three domestics and I, the  murderer was no longer there! I swear I do not know the murderer!\"    Must I say it,--in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson's  words, we did not believe in his denial. Frederic Larsan had shown us  the truth and it was not so easily given up.    Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an end, and  as we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph Rouletabille approached  Monsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand with the greatest respect, and  I heard him say:    \"I believe you, Monsieur.\"    I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to make from  Monsieur Maleine's narrative. I need not tell the reader that all that  passed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully reported to me  by Rouletabille.          CHAPTER XII. Frederic Larsan's Cane      It was not till six o'clock that I left the chateau, taking with me the  article hastily written by my friend in the little sitting-room which  Monsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our disposal. The reporter was  to sleep at the chateau, taking advantage of the to me inexplicable  hospitality offered him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, to whom Monsieur  Stangerson, in that sad time, left the care of all his domestic affairs.  Nevertheless he insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay. In  crossing the park, he said to me:    \"Frederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation. Do  you know how he came to find Daddy Jacques's boots?--Near the spot where  we noticed the traces of the neat boots and the disappearance of the  rough ones, there was a square hole, freshly made in the moist ground,  where a stone had evidently been removed. Larsan searched for that stone  without finding it, and at once imagined that it had been used by the  murderer with which to sink the boots in the lake. Fred's calculation  was an excellent one, as the success of his search proves. That escaped  me; but my mind was turned in another direction by the large number  of false indications of his track which the murderer left, and by  the measure of the black foot-marks corresponding with that of Daddy  Jacques's boots, which I had established without his suspecting it, on  the floor of The Yellow Room. All which was a proof, in my eyes, that  the murderer had sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant. Up to  that point, Larsan and I are in accord; but no further. It is going to  be a terrible matter; for I tell you he is working on wrong lines, and  I--I, must fight him with nothing!\"    I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young  friend pronounced the last words.    He repeated:    \"Yes terrible!--terrible! For it is fighting with nothing, when you have  only an idea to fight with.\"    At that moment we passed by the back of the chateau. Night had come. A  window on the first floor was partly open. A feeble light came from it  as well as some sounds which drew our attention. We approached until we  had reached the side of a door that was situated just under the window.  Rouletabille, in a low tone, made me understand, that this was the  window of Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber. The sounds which had  attracted our attention ceased, then were renewed for a moment, and then  we heard stifled sobs. We were only able to catch these words, which  reached us distinctly: \"My poor Robert!\"--Rouletabille whispered in my  ear:    \"If we only knew what was being said in that chamber, my inquiry would  soon be finished.\"    He looked about him. The darkness of the evening enveloped us; we could  not see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees, which ran behind  the chateau. The sobs had ceased.    \"If we can't hear we may at least try to see,\" said Rouletabille.    And, making a sign to me to deaden the sound of my steps, he led me  across the path to the trunk of a tall beech tree, the white bole of  which was visible in the darkness. This tree grew exactly in front of  the window in which we were so much interested, its lower branches being  on a level with the first floor of the chateau. From the height of  those branches one might certainly see what was passing in Mademoiselle  Stangerson's chamber. Evidently that was what Rouletabille thought, for,  enjoining me to remain hidden, he clasped the trunk with his vigorous  arms and climbed up. I soon lost sight of him amid the branches, and  then followed a deep silence. In front of me, the open window remained  lighted, and I saw no shadow move across it. I listened, and presently  from above me these words reached my ears:    \"After you!\"    \"After you, pray!\"    Somebody was overhead, speaking,--exchanging courtesies. What was my  astonishment to see on the slippery column of the tree two human forms  appear and quietly slip down to the ground. Rouletabille had mounted  alone, and had returned with another.    \"Good evening, Monsieur Sainclair!\"    It was Frederic Larsan. The detective had already occupied the post of  observation when my young friend had thought to reach it alone. Neither  noticed my astonishment. I explained that to myself by the fact that  they must have been witnesses of some tender and despairing scene  between Mademoiselle Stangerson, lying in her bed, and Monsieur Darzac  on his knees by her pillow. I guessed that each had drawn different  conclusions from what they had seen. It was easy to see that the scene  had strongly impressed Rouletabille in favour of Monsieur Robert Darzac;  while, to Larsan, it showed nothing but consummate hypocrisy, acted with  finished art by Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiance.    As we reached the park gate, Larsan stopped us.    \"My cane!\" he cried. \"I left it near the tree.\"    He left us, saying he would rejoin us presently.    \"Have you noticed Frederic Larsan's cane?\" asked the young reporter, as  soon as we were alone. \"It is quite a new one, which I have never seen  him use before. He seems to take great care of it--it never leaves him.  One would think he was afraid it might fall into the hands of strangers.  I never saw it before to-day. Where did he find it? It isn't natural  that a man who had never before used a walking-stick should, the day  after the Glandier crime, never move a step without one. On the day of  our arrival at the chateau, as soon as he saw us, he put his watch in  his pocket and picked up his cane from the ground--a proceeding to which  I was perhaps wrong not to attach some importance.\"    We were now out of the park. Rouletabille had dropped into silence. His  thoughts were certainly still occupied with Frederic Larsan's new cane.  I had proof of that when, as we came near to Epinay, he said:    \"Frederic Larsan arrived at the Glandier before me; he began his  inquiry before me; he has had time to find out things about which I know  nothing. Where did he find that cane?\" Then he added: \"It is probable  that his suspicion--more than that, his reasoning--has led him to lay  his hand on something tangible. Has this cane anything to do with it?  Where the deuce could he have found it?\"    As I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay, we entered a  wine shop. Almost immediately the door opened and"]]]
