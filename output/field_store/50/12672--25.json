For since every agent or thing moved, acts or is moved for an  end, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 2); those are perfectly moved by an  intrinsic principle, whose intrinsic principle is one not only of  movement but of movement for an end. Now in order for a thing to be  done for an end, some knowledge of the end is necessary. Therefore,  whatever so acts or is moved by an intrinsic principle, that it has  some knowledge of the end, has within itself the principle of its  act, so that it not only acts, but acts for an end. On the other  hand, if a thing has no knowledge of the end, even though it have an  intrinsic principle of action or movement, nevertheless the principle  of acting or being moved for an end is not in that thing, but in  something else, by which the principle of its action towards an end  is not in that thing, but in something else, by which the principle  of its action towards an end is imprinted on it. Wherefore such like  things are not said to move themselves, but to be moved by others.  But those things which have a knowledge of the end are said to move  themselves because there is in them a principle by which they not  only act but also act for an end. And consequently, since both are  from an intrinsic principle, to wit, that they act and that they act  for an end, the movements of such things are said to be voluntary:  for the word \"voluntary\" implies that their movements and acts are  from their own inclination. Hence it is that, according to the  definitions of Aristotle, Gregory of Nyssa, and Damascene [*See  Objection 1], the voluntary is defined not only as having \"a principle  within\" the agent, but also as implying \"knowledge.\" Therefore, since  man especially knows the end of his work, and moves himself, in his  acts especially is the voluntary to be found.    Reply Obj. 1: Not every principle is a first principle. Therefore,  although it is essential to the voluntary act that its principle be  within the agent, nevertheless it is not contrary to the nature of  the voluntary act that this intrinsic principle be caused or moved by  an extrinsic principle: because it is not essential to the voluntary  act that its intrinsic principle be a first principle. Yet again it  must be observed that a principle of movement may happen to be first  in a genus, but not first simply: thus in the genus of things subject  to alteration, the first principle of alteration is a heavenly body,  which nevertheless is not the first mover simply, but is moved  locally by a higher mover. And so the intrinsic principle of the  voluntary act, i.e. the cognitive and appetitive power, is the first  principle in the genus of appetitive movement, although it is moved  by an extrinsic principle according to other species of movement.    Reply Obj. 2: New movements in animals are indeed preceded by a  motion from without; and this in two respects. First, in so far as by  means of an extrinsic motion an animal's senses are confronted with  something sensible, which, on being apprehended, moves the appetite.  Thus a lion, on seeing a stag in movement and coming towards him,  begins to be moved towards the stag. Secondly, in so far as some  extrinsic motion produces a physical change in an animal's body, as  in the case of cold or heat; and through the body being affected by  the motion of an outward body, the sensitive appetite which is the  power of a bodily organ, is also moved indirectly; thus it happens  that through some alteration in the body the appetite is roused to  the desire of something. But this is not contrary to the nature of  voluntariness, as stated above (ad 1), for such movements caused by  an extrinsic principle are of another genus of movement.    Reply Obj. 3: God moves man to act, not only by proposing the  appetible to the senses, or by effecting a change in his body, but  also by moving the will itself; because every movement either of the  will or of nature, proceeds from God as the First Mover. And just as  it is not incompatible with nature that the natural movement be from  God as the First Mover, inasmuch as nature is an instrument of God  moving it: so it is not contrary to the essence of a voluntary act,  that it proceed from God, inasmuch as the will is moved by God.  Nevertheless both natural and voluntary movements have this in common,  that it is essential that they should proceed from a principle within  the agent.  ________________________    SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 6, Art. 2]    Whether There Is Anything Voluntary in Irrational Animals?    Objection 1: It would seem that there is nothing voluntary in  irrational animals. For a thing is called \"voluntary\" from _voluntas_  (will). Now since the will is in the reason (De Anima iii, 9), it  cannot be in irrational animals. Therefore neither is there anything  voluntary in them.    Obj. 2: Further, according as human acts are voluntary, man is said  to be master of his actions. But irrational animals are not masters  of their actions; for \"they act not; rather are they acted upon,\" as  Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 27). Therefore there is no such  thing as a voluntary act in irrational animals.    Obj. 3: Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. 24) that \"voluntary  acts lead to praise and blame.\" But neither praise nor blame is due  to the acts of irrational minds. Therefore such acts are not  voluntary.    _On the contrary,_ The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 2) that \"both  children and irrational animals participate in the voluntary.\" The  same is said by Damascene (De Fide Orth. 24) and Gregory of Nyssa  [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxxii.].    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1), it is essential to the  voluntary act that its principle be within the agent, together with  some knowledge of the end. Now knowledge of the end is twofold;  perfect and imperfect. Perfect knowledge of the end consists in not  only apprehending the thing which is the end, but also in knowing it  under the aspect of end, and the relationship of the means to that  end. And such knowledge belongs to none but the rational nature. But  imperfect knowledge of the end consists in mere apprehension of the  end, without knowing it under the aspect of end, or the relationship  of an act to the end. Such knowledge of the end is exercised by  irrational animals, through their senses and their natural estimative  power.    Consequently perfect knowledge of the end leads to the perfect  voluntary; inasmuch as, having apprehended the end, a man can, from  deliberating about the end and the means thereto, be moved, or not,  to gain that end. But imperfect knowledge of the end leads to the  imperfect voluntary; inasmuch as the agent apprehends the end, but  does not deliberate, and is moved to the end at once. Wherefore the  voluntary in its perfection belongs to none but the rational nature:  whereas the imperfect voluntary is within the competency of even  irrational animals.    Reply Obj. 1: The will is the name of the rational appetite; and  consequently it cannot be in things devoid of reason. But the word  \"voluntary\" is derived from \"voluntas\" (will), and can be extended to  those things in which there is some participation of will, by way of  likeness thereto. It is thus that voluntary action is attributed to  irrational animals, in so far as they are moved to an end, through  some kind of knowledge.    Reply Obj. 2: The fact that man is master of his actions, is due to  his being able to deliberate about them: for since the deliberating  reason is indifferently disposed to opposite things, the will can be  inclined to either. But it is not thus that voluntariness is in  irrational animals, as stated above.    Reply Obj. 3: Praise and blame are the result of the voluntary act,  wherein is the perfect voluntary; such as is not to be found in  irrational animals.  ________________________    THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 6, Art. 3]    Whether There Can Be Voluntariness Without Any Act?    Objection 1: It would seem that voluntariness cannot be without any  act. For that is voluntary which proceeds from the will. But nothing  can proceed from the will, except through some act, at least an act  of the will. Therefore there cannot be voluntariness without act.    Obj. 2: Further, just as one is said to wish by an act of the will,  so when the act of the will ceases, one is said not to wish. But not  to wish implies involuntariness, which is contrary to voluntariness.  Therefore there can be nothing voluntary when the act of the will  ceases.    Obj. 3: Further, knowledge is essential to the voluntary, as stated  above (AA. 1, 2). But knowledge involves an act. Therefore  voluntariness cannot be without some act.    _On the contrary,_ The word \"voluntary\" is applied to that of which  we are masters. Now we are masters in respect of to act and not to  act, to will and not to will. Therefore just as to act and to will  are voluntary, so also are not to act and not to will.    _I answer that,_ Voluntary is what proceeds from the will. Now one  thing proceeds from another in two ways. First, directly; in which  sense something proceeds from another inasmuch as this other acts;  for instance, heating from heat. Secondly, indirectly; in which sense  something proceeds from another through this other not acting; thus  the sinking of a ship is set down to the helmsman, from his having  ceased to steer. But we must take note that the cause of what follows  from want of action is not always the agent as not acting; but only  then when the agent can and ought to act. For if the helmsman were  unable to steer the ship or if the ship's helm be not entrusted to  him, the sinking of the ship would not be set down to him, although  it might be due to his absence from the helm.    Since, then, the will by willing and acting, is able, and sometimes  ought, to hinder not-willing and not-acting; this not-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#19)"],[1,"his hands or face. Then  there are at every turn and corner rough trunks of fallen trees,  visible or concealed, often more or less rotten and treacherous,  to be got over; and such things are frequently the only means of  crossing ditches and ravines of black rotting vegetable mud. Moreover  the paths are often very steep; and, indeed, it is this fact, and the  presence of rough stones and roots, which renders the very prominent  outward turn of the people's big toes, with their prehensile power,  such useful physical attributes.    Their bridges may be divided into four types, namely: (1) A single  tree thrown across the stream, having either been blown down, and so  fallen across it accidentally, or been purposely placed across it by  the natives. (2) Two or more such trunks placed in parallel lines  across the stream, and covered with a rough platform of transverse  pieces of wood. (3) The suspension bridge. I regret that I am unable  to give a detailed description of Mafulu suspension bridges, but I  think I am correct in saying that they are very similar to those of the  Kuni people, one of whose bridges is described in the _Annual Report_  for June, 1909, as being 150 feet long and 20 feet above water at the  lowest part, and as being made of lawyer vine (I do not know whether  this would be right for Mafulu), with flooring of pieces of stick  supported on strips of bark, and as presenting a crazy appearance,  which made the Governor's carriers afraid of crossing it, though  it was in fact perfectly safe, and had very little movement, even  in the middle. I also give in Plate 65 a photograph taken by myself  [63] of a bridge over the St. Joseph river, close to the Kuni village  of Ido-ido, which, though a Kuni bridge, may, I think, be taken as  fairly illustrative of a Mafulu bridge over a wide river. [64] Plate  66 is a photograph, taken in Mafulu, of another form of suspension  bridge used by them, and adapted to narrower rivers, the river in  this case being the Aduala. (4) The bamboo bridge. This is a highly  arched bridge of bamboo stems. The people take two long stems, and  splice them together at their narrow ends, the total length of the  spliced pair being considerably greater than the width of the river  to be bridged. They then place the spliced pair of bamboos across  the river, with one end against a strong backing and support on one  side of the river and the other end at the other side, where it will  extend for some little distance beyond the river bank. This further  end is then forcibly bent backward to the bank by a number of men  working together, and is there fixed and backed. The bamboo stems  then form a high arch over the river. They then fix another pair  of stems in the same way, close to and parallel with the first one;  and the double arch so formed is connected all the way across with  short pieces of wood, tied firmly to the stems, so as to strengthen  the bridge and form a footway, by which it can be crossed. They then  generally add a hand rail on one side.    One can hardly leave the question of physical communications without  also referring to the marvellous system of verbal communication which  exists amongst the Mafulu and Kuni and other mountain people. Messages  are shouted across the valleys from village to village in a way which  to the unaccustomed traveller is amazing. It never seemed to me that  any attempt was made specially to articulate the words and syllables  of the message, or to repeat them slowly, so as to make them more  readily heard at a distance off, though the last syllable of each  sentence is always prolonged into a continuous sort of wail. This  system of wireless telegraphy has, however, been before described by  other writers, so I need say no more about it.              CHAPTER VII    Government, Property, and Inheritance      Government and Justice.    There is, as might be expected, no organised system of government  among the Mafulu, nor is there any official administration of justice.    As regards government, the chiefs in informal consultation with the  sub-chiefs and prominent personages deal with important questions  affecting the community or clan or village as a whole, such as the  holding of big feasts and important ceremonies, the migrations or  splitting-up or amalgamation of villages, and warlike operations; but  events of this character are not frequent. And as to justice, neither  the chiefs nor any other persons have any official duties of settling  personal disputes or trying or punishing wrongdoers. The active  functions of the chiefs, in fact, appear to be largely ceremonial.    Concerning the question of justice, it would seem, indeed, that  a judicial system is hardly requisite. Personal disputes between  members of a village or clan, or even of a community, on such possible  subjects as inheritance, boundary, ownership of property, trespass  and the like, and wrongful acts within the village or the community,  are exceedingly rare, except as regards adultery and wounding and  killing cases arising from acts of adultery, which are more common.    There are certain things which from immemorial custom are regarded  as being wrong, and appropriate punishments for which are generally  recognised, especially stealing, wounding, killing and adultery; but  the punishment for these is administered by the injured parties and  their friends, favoured and supported by public opinion, and often,  where the offender belongs to another clan, actively helped by the  whole clan of the injured parties.    The penalty for stealing is the return or replacement of the article  stolen; but stealing within the community, and perhaps even more so  within the clan or village, is regarded as such a disgraceful offence,  more so, I believe, than either killing or adultery, that its mere  discovery involves a distressing punishment to the offender. As regards  wounding and killing, the recognised rule is blood for blood, and a  life for a life. The recognised code for adultery will be stated in  the chapter on matrimonial matters.    Any retribution for a serious offence committed by someone outside  the clan of the person injured is often directed, not only against  the offender himself, but against his whole clan.    There is a method of discovering the whereabouts of a stolen article,  and the identity of the thief, through the medium of a man who is  believed to have special powers of ascertaining them. This man takes  one of the large broad single-shell arm ornaments, which he places on  its edge on the ground, and one of the pig-bone implements already  described, which he places standing on its point upon the convex  surface of the shell. To make the implement stand in this way he puts  on the point, and makes to adhere to the shell a small piece of wild  bees' wax, this being done, I was told, surreptitiously, though I  cannot say to what extent the people are deceived by the dodge, or  are aware of it. The implement stands on the shell for a few seconds,  after which it falls down. Previously to doing this he has told his  client of certain possible directions in which the implement may fall,  and intimated that, whichever that may be, it will be the direction  in which the lost article must be sought. He has also given certain  alternative names of possible culprits, one of such names being  associated with each of the alternative directions of falling. The  fall of the implement thus indicates the quarter in which the lost  article may be found and the name of the thief. Father Clauser saw  this performance enacted in connection with a pig which had been  stolen from a chief; the falling bone successfully pointed to the  direction in which the pig was afterwards found, and there was no  doubt that the alleged thief was in fact the true culprit. Presumably  the operator makes private enquiries before trying his experiment,  and knows how to control the fall of the implement.            Property and Inheritance.    The property of a Mafulu native may be classified as being (1) his  movable belongings, such as clothing, ornaments, implements and pigs;  (2) his house in the village; (3) his bush land; (4) his gardens.    The movable belongings are, of course, his own absolute property.    The village house is also his own; but this does not include the site  of that house, which continues to be the property of the village. Every  grown-up male inhabitant of the village has the right to build for  himself one house in that village; he is not entitled to have more than  one there, but he may have a house in each of two or more villages,  and a chief or very important man is allowed two or three houses in  the same village. On a house being pulled down and not rebuilt, or  being abandoned and left to decay, the site reverts to the village,  and another person may build a house upon it. [65] Houses are never  sold, but the ordinary life of a house is only a few years.    The man's bush land is his own property, and his ownership includes  all trees and growth which may be upon it, and which no other man may  cut down, but it does not include game, this being the common property  of the community; and any member of the community is entitled to pass  over the land, hunt on it, and fish in streams passing through it,  as he pleases. The whole of the bush land of the community belongs  in separate portions to different owners, one man sometimes owning  two or more of such portions; and it is most remarkable that, though  there are apparently no artificial boundary marks between the various  portions, these boundaries are, somehow or other, known and respected,  and disputes with reference to them are practically unknown. How the  original allocations and allotments of land have been made does not  appear to be known to the people themselves.    The man's garden plot or plots are also his own, having been cleared  by him or some predecessor of "]]]
