Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him    for righteousness.    The Apostle next adduces the example of Abraham and reviews the  testimony of the Scriptures concerning faith. The first passage is taken  from Genesis 16:6: \"And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to  him for righteousness.\" The Apostle makes the most of this passage.  Abraham may have enjoyed a good standing with men for his upright life,  but not with God. In the sight of God, Abraham was a condemned sinner.  That he was justified before God was not due to his own exertions, but  due to his faith. The Scriptures expressly state: \"Abraham believed in  the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\"    Paul places the emphasis upon the two words: Abraham believed. Faith  in God constitutes the highest worship, the prime duty, the first  obedience, and the foremost sacrifice. Without faith God forfeits His  glory, wisdom, truth, and mercy in us. The first duty of man is to  believe in God and to honor Him with his faith. Faith is truly the  height of wisdom, the right kind of righteousness, the only real  religion. This will give us an idea of the excellence of faith.    To believe in God as Abraham did is to be right with God because faith  honors God. Faith says to God: \"I believe what you say.\" When we pay  attention to reason, God seems to propose impossible matters in the  Christian Creed. To reason it seems absurd that Christ should offer His  body and blood in the Lord's Supper; that Baptism should be the washing  of regeneration; that the dead shall rise; that Christ the Son of God  was conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary, etc. Reason shouts that  all this is preposterous. Are you surprised that reason thinks little  of faith? Reason thinks it ludicrous that faith should be the foremost  service any person can render unto God.    Let your faith supplant reason. Abraham mastered reason by faith in the  Word of God. Not as though reason ever yields meekly. It put up a fight  against the faith of Abraham. Reason protested that it was absurd to  think that Sarah who was ninety years old and barren by nature, should  give birth to a son. But faith won the victory and routed reason, that  ugly beast and enemy of God. Everyone who by faith slays reason, the  world's biggest monster, renders God a real service, a better service  than the religions of all races and all the drudgery of meritorious  monks can render.    Men fast, pray, watch, suffer. They intend to appease the wrath of God  and to deserve God's grace by their exertions. But there is no glory in  it for God, because by their exertions these workers pronounce God an  unmerciful slave driver, an unfaithful and angry Judge. They despise  God, make a liar out of Him, snub Christ and all His benefits; in short  they pull God from His throne and perch themselves on it.    Faith truly honors God. And because faith honors God, God counts faith  for righteousness.    Christian righteousness is the confidence of the heart in God through  Christ Jesus. Such confidence is accounted righteousness for Christ's  sake. Two things make for Christian righteousness: Faith in Christ,  which is a gift of God; and God's acceptance of this imperfect faith  of ours for perfect righteousness. Because of my faith in Christ, God  overlooks my distrust, the unwillingness of my spirit, my many other  sins. Because the shadow of Christ's wing covers me I have no fear  that God will cover all my sins and take my imperfections for perfect  righteousness.    God \"winks\" at my sins and covers them up. God says: \"Because you  believe in My Son I will forgive your sins until death shall deliver you  from the body of sin.\"    Learn to understand the constitution of your Christian righteousness.  Faith is weak, but it means enough to God that He will not lay sin to  our charge. He will not punish nor condemn us for it. He will forgive  our sins as though they amount to nothing at all. He will do it not  because we are worthy of such mercy. He will do it for Jesus' sake in  whom we believe.    Paradoxically, a Christian is both right and wrong, holy and profane,  an enemy of God and a child of God. These contradictions no person can  harmonize who does not understand the true way of salvation. Under the  papacy we were told to toil until the feeling of guilt had left us. But  the authors of this deranged idea were frequently driven to despair  in the hour of death. It would have happened to me, if Christ had not  mercifully delivered me from this error.    We comfort the afflicted sinner in this manner: Brother, you can never  be perfect in this life, but you can be holy. He will say: \"How can I be  holy when I feel my sins?\" I answer: You feel sin? That is a good sign.  To realize that one is ill is a step, and a very necessary step, toward  recovery. \"But how will I get rid of my sin?\" he will ask. I answer:  See the heavenly Physician, Christ, who heals the broken-hearted. Do not  consult that Quackdoctor, Reason. Believe in Christ and your sins will  be pardoned. His righteousness will become your righteousness, and your  sins will become His sins.    On one occasion Jesus said to His disciples: \"The Father loveth you.\"  Why? Not because the disciples were Pharisees, or circumcised, or  particularly attentive to the Law. Jesus said: \"The Father loveth you,  because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. It  pleased you to know that the Father sent me into the world. And because  you believed it the Father loves you.\" On another occasion Jesus called  His disciples evil and commanded them to ask for forgiveness.    A Christian is beloved of God and a sinner. How can these two  contradictions be harmonized: I am a sinner and deserve God's wrath  and punishment, and yet the Father loves me? Christ alone can harmonize  these contradictions. He is the Mediator.    Do you now see how faith justifies without works? Sin lingers in us, and  God hates sin. A transfusion of righteousness therefore becomes vitally  necessary. This transfusion of righteousness we obtain from Christ  because we believe in Him.        VERSE 7. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are    the children of Abraham.    This is the main point of Paul's argument against the Jews: The children  of Abraham are those who believe and not those who are born of Abraham's  flesh and blood. This point Paul drives home with all his might because  the Jews attached saving value to the genealogical fact: \"We are the  seed and children of Abraham.\"    Let us begin with Abraham and learn how this friend of God was justified  and saved. Not because he left his country, his relatives, his father's  house; not because he was circumcised; not because he stood ready to  sacrifice his own son Isaac in whom he had the promise of posterity.  Abraham was justified because he believed. Paul's argumentation runs  like this: \"Since this is the unmistakable testimony of Holy Writ, why  do you take your stand upon circumcision and the Law? Was not Abraham,  your father, of whom you make so much, justified and saved without  circumcision and the Law by faith alone?\" Paul therefore concludes:  \"They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.\"    Abraham was the father of the faithful. In order to be a child of the  believing Abraham you must believe as he did. Otherwise you are merely  the physical offspring of the procreating Abraham, i.e., you were  conceived and born in sin unto wrath and condemnation.    Ishmael and Isaac were both the natural children of Abraham. By rights  Ishmael should have enjoyed the prerogatives of the firstborn, if  physical generation had any special value. Nevertheless he was left out  in the cold while Isaac was called. This goes to prove that the children  of faith are the real children of Abraham.    Some find fault with Paul for applying the term \"faith\" in Genesis 15:6  to Christ. They think Paul's use of the term too wide and general.  They think its meaning should be restricted to the context. They claim  Abraham's faith had no more in it than a belief in the promise of God  that he should have seed.    We reply: Faith presupposes the assurance of God's mercy. This assurance  takes in the confidence that our sins are forgiven for Christ's sake.  Never will the conscience trust in God unless it can be sure of God's  mercy and promises in Christ. Now all the promises of God lead back to  the first promise concerning Christ: \"And I will put enmity between thee  and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy  head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\" The faith of the fathers in the  Old Testament era, and our faith in the New Testament are one and the  same faith in Christ Jesus, although times and conditions may differ.  Peter acknowledged this in the words: \"Which neither our fathers nor  we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord  Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.\" (Acts l5: 10, 11.) And  Paul writes: \"And did all drink the spiritual drink; for they drank of  that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.\" (I  Cor. 10:4.) And Christ Himself declared: \"Your father Abraham rejoiced  to see my day: and he saw it and was glad.\" (John 8:56.) The faith of  the fathers was directed at the Christ who was to come, while ours rests  in the Christ who has come. Time does not change the object of true  faith, or the Holy Spirit. There has always been and always will be one  mind, one impression, one faith concerning Christ among true believers  whether they live in times past, now, or in times to come. We too  believe in the Christ to come as the fathers did in the Old Testament,  for we look for Christ to come again on the last day to judge the quick  and the dead.        VERSE 7.

One is represented by the very efficient European professional  standards of technic, which may result in an absolute failure of poetic  musical comprehension. These should not be transplanted here from  European soil. The other is the non-technical, sentimental, formless  species of teaching which can only result in emotional enervation. Yet  if forced to choose between the two the former would be preferable since  without tools it is impossible to carve anything of beauty. The final  beauty of the violin tone, the pure _legato_, remains in the beginning  as in the end a matter of holding the violin and bow. Together they  'place' the tone just as the physical _media_ in the throat 'place' the  tone of the voice.    \"Piano teachers have made greater advances in the tone developing  technic of their instrument than the violin teachers. One reason is,  that as a class they are more intellectual. And then, too, violin  teaching is regarded too often as a mystic art, an occult science, and  one into which only those specially gifted may hope to be initiated.  This, it seems to me, is a fallacy. Just as a gift for mathematics is a  special talent not given to all, so a _natural_ technical talent exists  in relatively few people. Yet this does not imply that the majority are  shut off from playing the violin and playing it well. Any student who  has music in his soul may be taught to play simple, and even relatively  more difficult music with beauty, beauty of expression and  interpretation. This he may be taught to do even though not endowed with  a _natural_ technical facility for the violin. A proof that natural  technical facility is anything but a guarantee of higher musicianship is  shown in that the musical weakness of many brilliant violinists, hidden  by the technical elaboration of virtuoso pieces, is only apparent when  they attempt to play a Beethoven _adagio_ or a simple Mozart _rondo_.    \"In a number of cases the unsuccessful solo player has a bad effect on  violin teaching. Usually the soloist who has not made a success as a  concert artist takes up teaching as a last resort, without enthusiasm or  the true vocational instinct. The false standards he sets up for his  pupils are a natural result of his own ineffectual worship of the fetish  of virtuosity--those of the musical mountebank of a hundred years ago.  Of course such false prophets of the virtuose have nothing in common  with such high-priests of public utterance as Ysaye, Kreisler and  others, whose virtuosity is a true means for the higher development of  the musical. The encouragement of musicianship in general suffers for  the stress laid on what is obviously technical _impedimenta_. But more  and more, as time passes, the playing of such artists as those already  mentioned, and others like them, shows that the real musician is the  lover of beautiful sound, which technic merely develops in the highest  degree.    \"To-day technic in a cumulative sense often is a confession of failure.  For technic does not do what it so often claims to--produce the artist.  Most professional teaching aims to prepare the student for professional  life, the concert stage. Hence there is an intensive _technical_ study  of compositions that even if not wholly intended for display are  primarily and principally projected for its sake. It is a well-known  fact that few, even among gifted players, can sit down to play chamber  music and do it justice. This is not because they cannot grasp or  understand it; or because their technic is insufficient. It is because  their whole violinistic education has been along the line of solo  playing; they have literally been brought up, not to play _with_ others,  but to be accompanied _by_ others.    \"Yet despite all this there has been a notable development of violin  study in the direction of _ensemble_ work with, as a result, an attitude  on the part of the violinists cultivating it, of greater humility as  regards music in general, a greater appreciation of the charm of  artistic collaboration: and--I insist--a technic both finer and more  flexible. Chamber music--originally music written for the intimate  surroundings of the home, for a small circle of listeners--carries out  in its informal way many of the ideals of the larger orchestral  _ensemble_. And, as regards the violinist, he is not dependent only on  the literature of the string quartet; there are piano quintets and  quartets, piano trios, and the duos for violin and piano. Some of the  most beautiful instrumental thoughts of the classic and modern  composers are to be found in the duo for violin and piano, mainly in the  sonata form. Amateurs--violinists who love music for its own sake, and  have sufficient facility to perform such works creditably--do not do  nearly enough _ensemble_ playing with a pianist. It is not always  possible to get together the four players needed for the string quartet,  but a pianist is apt to be more readily found.    \"The combination of violin and piano is as a rule obtainable and the  literature is particularly rich. Aside from sonatas by Corelli,  Locatelli, Tartini, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Haendel, Brahms and  Schumann, nearly all the romantic and modern composers have contributed  to it. And this music has all been written so as to show the character  of each instrument at its best--the piano, harmonic in its nature; the  violin, a natural melodic voice, capable of every shade of _nuance_.\"  That Mr. Mannes, as an artist, has made a point of \"practicing what he  preaches\" to the student as regards the _ensemble_ of violin and piano  will be recalled by all who have enjoyed the 'Sonata Recitals' he has  given together with Mrs. Mannes. And as an interpreting solo artist his  views regarding the moot question of gut _versus_ wire strings are of  interest.                              GUT VERSUS WIRE STRINGS    \"My own violin, a Maggini of more than the usual size, dates from the  year 1600. It formerly belonged to Dr. Leopold Damrosch. Which strings  do I use on it? The whole question as to whether gut or wire strings are  to be preferred may, in my opinion, be referred to the violin itself for  decision. What I mean is that if Stradivarius, Guarnerius, Amati,  Maggini and others of the old-master builders of violins had ever had  wire strings in view, they would have built their fiddles in accordance,  and they would not be the same we now possess. First of all there are  scientific reasons against using the wire strings. They change the tone  of the instrument. The rigidity of tension of the wire E string where it  crosses the bridge tightens up the sound of the lower strings. Their  advantages are: reliability under adverse climatic conditions and the  incontestable fact that they make things easier technically. They  facilitate purity of intonation. Yet I am willing to forgo these  advantages when I consider the wonderful pliability of the gut strings  for which Stradivarius built his violins. I can see the artistic  retrogression of those who are using the wire E, for when materially  things are made easier, spiritually there is a loss.                                    CHIN RESTS    \"And while we are discussing the physical aspects of the instrument  there is the 'chin rest.' None of the great violin makers ever made a  'chin rest.' Increasing technical demands, sudden pyrotechnical flights  into the higher octaves brought the 'chin rest' into being. The 'chin  rest' was meant to give the player a better grasp of his instrument. I  absolutely disapprove, in theory, of chin rest, cushion or pad.  Technical reasons may be adduced to justify their use, never artistic  ones. I admit that progress in violin study is infinitely slower without  the use of the pad; but the more close and direct a contact with his  instrument the player can develop, the more intimately expressive his  playing becomes. Students with long necks and thin bodies claim they  have to use a 'chin rest,' but the study of physical adjustments could  bring about a better cooerdination between them and the instrument. A  thin pad may be used without much danger, yet I feel that the thicker  and higher the 'chin rest' the greater the loss in expressive rendering.  The more we accustom ourselves to mechanical aids, the more we will come  to rely on them.... But the question you ask anent 'Violin Mastery'  leads altogether away from the material!                                   VIOLIN MASTERY    \"To me it signifies technical efficiency coupled with poetic insight,  freedom from conventionally accepted standards, the attainment of a more  varied personal expression along individual lines. It may be realized,  of course, only to a degree, since the possessor of absolute 'Violin  Mastery' would be forever glorified. As it is the violin master, as I  conceive him, represents the embodier of the greatest intimacy between  himself, the artist, and his medium of expression. Considered in this  light Pablo Casals and his 'cello, perhaps, most closely comply with the  requirements of the definition. And this is not as paradoxical as it may  seem, since all string instruments are brethren, descended from the  ancient viol, and the 'cello is, after all, a variant of the violin!\"                                             XIV                                    TIVADAR NACHEZ                         JOACHIM AND LEONARD AS TEACHERS      Tivadar Nachez, the celebrated violin virtuoso, is better known as a  concertizing artist in Europe, where he has played with all the leading  symphonic orchestras, than in this country, to which he paid his first  visit during these times of war, and which he was about to leave for his  London home when the writer had the pleasure of meeting him.
