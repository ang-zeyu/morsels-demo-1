On the party  came, until almost in front of me, and now I had better describe them.  The rider was in full dinner dress, with white waistcoat, and wearing a  tall chimney-pot hat, and he sat a powerful hill pony (dark brown, with  mane and tail) in a listless sort of way, the reins hanging loosely from  both hands. A Syce led the pony on each side, but their faces I could  not see, the one next to me having his back to me and the one farthest  off being hidden by the pony's head. Each held the bridle close by the  bit, the man next me with his right and the other with his left hand,  and the hands were on the thighs of the rider, as if to steady him in  his seat. As they approached, I knowing they could not get to any place  other than my own, called out in Hindustani, 'Quon hai?' (Who is it?).  There was no answer, and on they came until right in front of me, when I  said, in English, 'Hullo, what the d----l do you want here?' Instantly  the group came to a halt, the rider gathering the bridle reins up in  both hands, turned his face, which had hitherto been looking away from  me, towards me, and looked down upon me. The group was still as in a  tableau, with the bright moon shining upon it, and I at once recognized  the rider as Lieutenant B., whom I had formerly known. The face,  however, was different from what it used to be; in the place of being  clean-shaven, as when I used to know it, it was now surrounded by a  fringe (what used to be known as a Newgate fringe), and it was the face  of a dead man, the ghastly waxen pallor of it brought out more  distinctly in the moonlight by the dark fringe of hair by which it was  encircled; the body, too, was much stouter than when I had known it in  life.    \"I marked this in a moment; and then resolved to lay hold of the thing,  whatever it might be. I dashed up the bank, and the earth which had been  thrown on the side giving under my feet, I fell forward up the bank on  my hands, recovering myself instantly. I gained the road, and stood in  the exact spot where the group had been, but which was now vacant, there  was not the trace of anything; it was impossible for them to go on, the  road stopped at a precipice about twenty yards further on, and it was  impossible to turn and go back in a second. All this flashed through my  mind, and I then ran along the road for about 100 yards, along which  they had come, until I had to stop for want of breath, but there was no  trace of anything, and not a sound to be heard. I then returned home,  where I found my dogs, who, on all other occasions my most faithful  companions, had not come with me along the road.    \"Next morning I went up to D., who belonged to the same regiment as B.,  and gradually induced him to talk of him. I said, 'How very stout he had  become lately, and what possessed him to allow his beard to grow with  that horrid fringe?' D. replied, 'Yes, he became very bloated before his  death. You know he led a very fast life, and while on the sick list he  allowed the fringe to grow, in spite of all that we could say to him,  and I believe he was buried with it.' I asked him where he got the pony  I had seen, describing it minutely. 'Why,' said D., 'how do you know  anything about all this? You hadn't seen B. for two or three years, and  the pony you never saw. He bought him at Peshawur, and killed him one  day riding in his reckless fashion down the hill to Trete.' I then told  him what I had seen the night before.    \"Once, when the galloping sound was very distinct, I rushed to the door  of my house. There I found my Hindoo bearer, standing with a tattie in  his hand. I asked him what he was there for. He said that there came a  sound of riding down the hill, and 'passed him like a typhoon,' and went  round the corner of the house, and he was determined to waylay it,  whatever it was.\"    In commenting on the case, Mr. Stead remarks, \"That such a story as  this, gravely told by a British General in the present day, helps us to  understand how our ancestors came to believe in the wonderful story of  Herne the Hunter.\" I do not know about Herne the Hunter, but it is at  all events good testimony that horses as well as men have spirits, for  one of the ghosts the General saw was, undoubtedly, that of the pony  murdered by B. Why it was still ridden by the phantom of its former  master is another question.    The next case I narrate is also taken from Mr. Stead's same work. It was  sent him by one of the leading townsmen of Cowes, in the Isle of Wight,  and runs thus:--    \"On a fine evening in April, 1859, the writer was riding with a friend  on a country road. Twilight was closing down on us, when, after a  silence of some minutes, my friend suddenly exclaimed:    \"'No man knows me better than you do, J. Do you think I am a nervous,  easily frightened sort of man?'    \"'Far from it,' said I, 'among all the men I know in the wild country I  have lived and worked in, I know none more fearless or of more  unhesitating nerve.'    \"'Well,' said he, 'I think I am that, too, and though I have travelled  these roads all sorts of hours, summer and winter, for twenty years, I  never met anything to startle me, or that I could not account for, until  last Monday evening. About this time it was. Riding old Fan' (a chestnut  mare) 'here on this cross-' (a four-way cross) 'road, on my near side  was a man on a grey horse, coming from this left-hand road. I had to  pull my off-rein to give myself room to pass ahead of him; he was coming  at a right angle to me. As I passed the head of the horse I called out  \"Good night.\" Hearing no reply, I turned in my saddle to the off-side,  to see whether he appeared to be asleep as he rode, but to my surprise I  saw neither man nor horse. So sure was I that I had seen such, that I  wheeled old Fan round, and rode back to the middle of the cross, and on  neither of the four roads could I see a man or horse, though there was  light enough to see two hundred or three hundred yards, as we can now.  Well, I then rode over that gate' (a gate at one corner opening into a  grass field), 'thinking he might have gone that way; looking down by  each hedge, I could see nothing of my man and horse; and then--and not  until then--I felt myself thrill and start with a shuddering sense that  I had seen something uncanny, and, Jove! I put the mare down this hill  we are on now at her very best pace. But the strangest part of my story  is to come,' said he, continuing.    \"'After I had done my business at the farmhouse here, at foot of this  hill, I told the old farmer and his wife what I had seen, as I have now  told you. The old man said:    \"'\"For many years I have known thee, M----, on this road, and have you  never seen the like before on that cross?\"    \"'\"Seen what before?\" I said.    \"'\"Why, a man in light-coloured clothes on a grey horse,\" said he.    \"'\"No, never,\" said I, \"but I swear I have this evening.\"    \"'The farmer asked, \"Had I never heard of what happened to the Miller of  L---- Mills about forty years ago?\"    \"'\"No, never a word,\" I told him.    \"'\"Well,\" he said, \"about forty years ago this miller, returning from  market, was waylaid and murdered on that cross-road, pockets rifled of  money and watch. The horse ran home, about a mile away. Two serving-men  set out with lanterns and found their master dead. He was dressed, as  millers often do in this part of the country, in light-coloured clothes,  and the horse was a grey horse. The murderers were never found. These  are facts,\" continued the farmer. \"I took this farm soon after it all  happened, and, though I have known all this, and have passed over that  cross several thousands of times, I never knew anything unusual there  myself, but there have been a number of people who tell the same story  you have told mother and me, M----, and describe the appearance as you  have done to us to-night.\"'\"    Mr. Stead goes on to add: \"Four evenings after all this occurred my  friend related it to me as we were riding along the same road. He  continued to pass there many times every year for ten years, but never a  day saw anything of that sort.\"    My next case, a reproduction of a letter in the _Occult Review_ of  September, 1906, reads thus:--      \"_A Phantom Horse and Rider--Mrs. Gaskin Anderston's Story_    \"The following story is, I think, very remarkable, and I give it exactly  as it was told to me, and written down at the time.    \"A number of members of a gentleman's club were talking and discussing,  amongst other subjects, the possibility of there being a future state  for animals. One of the members said:    \"'I firmly believe there is. In my early youth I had a practice as a  medical man in one of the Midland Counties. One of my patients was a  very wealthy man, who owned large tracts of land and had a stud  composed entirely of bay horses with black points--this was a hobby of  his, and he would never have any others. One day a messenger came  summoning me to Mr. L----, as he had just met with a very bad accident,  and was on the point of death. I mounted my horse and started off  without delay. As I was riding through the front gates to the house, I  heard a shot, and to my amazement the very man I was going to visit rode  past at a furious pace, riding a wretched-looking chestnut with one  white forefoot and a white star on its forehead. Arrived at the house  the butler said:    \"'\"He has gone, sir; they had to shoot the horse--you would hear the  shot--and at the same moment my master died.\"    \"'He had had this horse sent on approval; whilst riding it, it backed  over a precipice, injuring Mr. L---- fatally, and on being taken to the  stables it was found necessary to shoot it.'--Alpha.\"    The next case I append (I published it in a weekly journal some years  ago) was related"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#19)"],[1," the United Provinces there is a large exodus of  brain-fever birds, koels, pied crested-cuckoos, paradise flycatchers  and Indian orioles. These last are replaced by black-headed orioles in  the United Provinces, but not in the Punjab.    On the other hand, the great autumnal immigration takes place  throughout the month. Before September is half over the migratory  wagtails begin to appear. Like most birds they travel by night when  migrating. They arrive in silence, but on the morning of their coming  the observer cannot fail to notice their cheerful little notes, which,  like the hanging of the village smoke, are to be numbered among the  signs of the approach of winter. The three species that visit India in  the largest numbers are the white (_Motacilla alba_), the masked (_M.  personata_) and the grey wagtail (_M. melanope_). In Bengal the first  two are largely replaced by the white-faced wagtail (_M. leucopsis_).  The names \"white\" and \"grey\" are not very happy ones. The white  species is a grey bird with a white face and some black on the head  and breast; the masked wagtail is very difficult to distinguish from  the white species, differing in having less white and more black on  the head and face, the white constituting the \"mask\"; the grey wagtail  has the upper plumage greenish-grey and the lower parts  sulphur-yellow. The three species arrive almost simultaneously, but  the experience of the writer is that the grey bird usually comes a day  or two before his cousins.    On one of the last ten days of September the first batch of Indian  redstarts (_Ruticilla frontalis_) reaches India. Within twenty days of  the coming of these welcome little birds it is possible to dispense  with punkas.    Like the redstarts the rose-finches and minivets begin to pour into  India towards the end of September. The snipe arrive daily throughout  the month.    With the first full moon of September come the grey quail (_Coturnix  communis_). These, like the rain-quail, afford good sport with the gun  if attracted by call birds set down overnight. When the stream of  immigrating quail has ceased to flow, these birds spread themselves  over the well-cropped country. It then becomes difficult to obtain a  good bag of quail until the time of the spring harvest, when they  collect in the crops that are still standing.    Thousands of blue-winged teal invade India in September, but most of  the other species of non-resident duck do not arrive until October or  even November.    Not the least important of the September arrivals are the migratory  birds of prey. None of the owls seem to migrate. Nor do the vultures,  but a large proportion of the diurnal raptores leaves the plains of  India in the spring.    To every migratory species of raptorial bird, that captures living  quarry, there is a non-migratory counterpart or near relative. It  would almost seem as if each species were broken up into two clans--a  migratory and a stationary one. Thus, of each of the following pairs  of birds the first-named is migratory and the other non-migratory: the  steppe-eagle and the tawny eagle, the large Indian and the common  kite, the long-legged and the white-eyed buzzard, the sparrow-hawk and  the shikra, the peregrine and the lugger falcon, the common and the  red-headed merlin, the kestrel and the black-winged kite.    It is tempting to formulate the theory that the raptores are migratory  or the reverse according or not as they prey on birds of passage, and  that the former migrate merely in order to follow their quarry.  Certain facts seem to bear out this theory. The peregrine falcon,  which feeds largely on ducks, is migratory, while the lugger falcon--a  bird not particularly addicted to waterfowl--remains in India  throughout the year.    The necessity of following their favourite quarry may account for the  migratory habits of some birds of prey, but it does not apply to all.  Thus, the osprey, which feeds almost exclusively on fish, is merely a  winter visitor to India. Again, there is the kestrel. This preys on  non-migratory rats and mice, nevertheless it leaves the plains in the  hot weather and goes to the Himalayas to breed. All the species of  birds of prey cited above as migratory begin to arrive in the plains  of India in September. The merlins come only into the Punjab, but most  of the other raptores spread over the whole of India.    The various species of harrier make their appearance in September.  These are birds that cannot fail to attract attention. They usually  fly slowly a few feet above the surface of the earth so that they can  drop suddenly on their quarry. They squat on the ground when resting,  but their wings are long and their bodies light, so that they do not  need much rest. Those who shoot duck have occasion often to say hard  things of the marsh-harrier and the peregrine falcon, because these  birds are apt to come as unbidden guests to the shoot and carry off  wounded duck and teal before the _shikari_ has time to retrieve them.    Of the migratory birds of prey the kestrel is perhaps the first to  arrive; the osprey and the peregrine falcon are among the last.    Very few observations of the comings and the goings of the various  raptorial birds have been recorded; in the present state of our  knowledge it is not possible to compile an accurate table showing the  usual order in which the various species appear. This is a subject to  which those persons who dwell permanently in one place might with  advantage direct their attention.    As regards nesting operations September is not a month of activity.    On the 15th the close season for game birds ends in the Government  forests; and by that date the great majority of them have reared up  their broods. Grey partridge's eggs, it is true, have been taken in  September; but as we have seen, grey partridges, like doves and kites,  can scarcely be said to have a breeding season; they lay eggs whenever  it seemeth good to them.    A few belated peafowl may still be found with eggs, but these are  exceptions. Most of the hens are strutting about proudly, accompanied  by their chicks, while the cocks are shedding their trains. Other  species of which the eggs may be found in the present month are the  white-throated munia, the common and the large grey babblers, and, of  course, the various species of dove.    Before the last day of August all the young mynas have emerged from  the egg, and throughout the first half of September numbers of them  are to be seen following their parents and clamouring for food. Most  of the koels have departed, but some individuals belonging to the  rising generation remind us that they are still with us by emitting  sounds which are very fair imitations of the \"sqwaking\" of young  crows.    Baby koels are as importunate as professional beggars and solicit food  of every crow that passes by, to the great disgust of all but their  foster-parents.    The majority of the seven sisters have done with nursery duties for a  season. Some flocks, however, are still accompanied by impedimenta in  the shape of young babblers or pied crested-cuckoos. The impedimenta  make far more noise than the adult birds. They are always hungry, or  at any rate always demanding food in squeaky tones. With each squeak  the wings are flapped violently, as if to emphasise the demand. Every  member of a flock appears to help to feed the young birds irrespective  of whose nests these have been reared in.    Throughout September bayas are to be seen at their nests, but, before  the month draws to its close, nearly all the broods have come out into  the great world. The nests will remain until next monsoon, or even  longer, as monuments of sound workmanship.    In September numbers of curious brown birds, heavily barred with  black, make their appearance. These are crow-pheasants that have  emerged from nests hidden away in dense thickets. In a few weeks these  birds will lose their barred feathers and assume the black plumage and  red wings of the adult. By the end of August most of the night-herons  and those of the various species of egrets that have not been killed  by the plume-hunters are able to congratulate themselves on having  successfully reared up their broods. In September they lose their  nuptial plumes.          OCTOBER      Ye strangers, banished from your native glades,    Where tyrant frost with famine leag'd proclaims    \"Who lingers dies\"; with many a risk ye win    The privilege to breathe our softer air    And glean our sylvan berries.                             GISBORNE'S _Walks in a Forest_.      October in India differs from the English month in almost every  respect. The one point of resemblance is that both are periods of  falling temperature.    In England autumn is the season for the departure of the migratory  birds; in India it is the time of their arrival.    The chief feature of the English October--the falling of the  leaves--is altogether wanting in the Indian autumn.    Spring is the season in which the pulse of life beats most vigorously  both in Europe and in Asia; it is therefore at that time of year that  the trees renew their garments.    In England leaves are short-lived. After an existence of about six  months they \"curl up, become brown, and flutter from their sprays.\" In  India they enjoy longer lives, and retain their greenness for the  greater part of a year. A few Indian trees, as, for example, the  shesham, lose their foliage in autumn; the silk-cotton and the coral  trees part with their leaves gradually during the early months of the  winter, but these are the exceptions; nearly all the trees retain  their old leaves until the new ones appear in spring, so that, in this  country, March, April and May are the months in which the dead leaves  lie thick upon the ground.    In many ways the autumn season in Northern India resembles the English  spring. The Indian October may be likened to April in"]]]
