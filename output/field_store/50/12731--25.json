News Letter      The News Letter which you have lately initiated fulfills a very vital  function and has been started admirably well. I would urge you to enlarge  its scope, as much as your resources permit, that in time it may devote a  special section to every phase of your activities, administrative,  devotional, humanitarian, financial, educational and otherwise. That it  may attain its object it must combine the essential qualities of accuracy,  reliability, thoroughness, dignity and wisdom. It should become a great  factor in promoting understanding, providing information on Baha'i  activity, both local and foreign, in stimulating interest, in combating  evil influences, and in upholding and safeguarding the institutions of the  Cause. It should be made as representative as possible, should be replete  with news, up-to-date in its information, and should arouse the keenest  interest among believers and admirers alike in every corner of the globe.  I cherish great hopes for its immediate future, and I trust you will  devote your special attention to its development, and by devising  well-conceived and worldwide measures transform this News Letter into what  I hope will become the foremost Baha'i Journal of the world.          Title of Assemblies      As to the title to be adopted for letterheads, I would suggest, pending  the formation of the Universal House of Justice, the phrase \"The National  Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada,\"  retaining the word \"spiritual\" and restricting the meaning of the term  \"assembly\" to be applied only to the body of nine elected by the friends  whether for local or national purposes.          Representation at Convention      I have already replied to your cable in connection with the representation  of groups of less than nine adult believers at the annual Convention and  the matter of proxy, the latter being left to the discretion of the  National Spiritual Assembly. Should the conditions be altered, and the  number of Baha'i localities multiply, the situation will have to be  considered afresh and a new basis for representation adopted.          The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar      Regarding the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I would again most emphatically urge  the believers in America, and ask you to do the utmost you can to devise  every possible means for the removal of every outstanding financial  liability incurred in this connection. I would remind you of the supreme  and urgent necessity of raising the full sum decided upon by the National  Spiritual Assembly at its meeting in Chicago in order to meet the  immediate needs of this great future House of Worship. I would welcome a  full, authorized and up-to-date statement on its present situation, its  assets and liabilities and an estimate of the cost for its completion.    In conclusion I wish to renew the assurance of my ardent prayers for you  and for those whom you represent in safeguarding and promoting the sacred  interests of so precious a Cause. I am fully alive to the vastness and  delicacy of your task, I heartily appreciate your indefatigable efforts  and unflinching determination, I am continually reminded of our Master's  assurances of a dazzling future before you. May His love enfold you, His  Spirit guide you, and His power enable you to achieve signal victory.    Your brother in the Master's service,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  April 10th, 1925.          Letter of May 12, 1925.      To the members of the American National Assembly.    Dearly-beloved fellow-workers:    I have read with deep interest your two recent communications dated April  4th and 18th, and am gratified to learn of the steady expansion of your  manifold activities.          Election of National Assembly      Regarding the method to be adopted for the election of the National  Spiritual Assemblies, it is clear that the text of the Beloved's Testament  gives us no indication as to the manner in which these Assemblies are to  be elected. In one of His earliest Tablets, however, addressed to a friend  in Persia, the following is expressly recorded:--    \"At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint their  delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and these  representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the Supreme  Baytu'l-'Adl (Universal House of Justice).\"    These words clearly indicate that a three-stage election has been provided  by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the formation of the International House of Justice,  and as it is explicitly provided in His Will and Testament that the  \"Secondary House of Justice (i.e., National Assemblies) must elect the  members of the Universal One,\" it is obvious that the members of the  National Spiritual Assemblies will have to be indirectly elected by the  body of the believers in their respective provinces. In view of these  complementary instructions the principle, set forth in my letter of March  12th, 1923, has been established requiring the believers (the beloved of  God) in every country to elect a certain number of delegates who, in turn,  will elect their national representatives (Secondary House of Justice or  National Spiritual Assembly) whose sacred obligation and privilege will be  to elect in time God's Universal House of Justice.    Should the appointing of the delegates be made a part of the functions of  local Spiritual Assemblies, who are already elected bodies, the principle  of a four-stage election would be introduced which would be at variance  with the provisions explicitly laid down in the Master's Tablet. On the  other hand, were the local Spiritual Assemblies, the number of whose  members is strictly confined to nine, to elect directly the members of the  National Spiritual Assembly--thus maintaining the principle of a  three-stage election--all Baha'i localities, which must necessarily differ  in numerical strength, would then have to share equally in the election of  the National Spiritual Assembly--a practice which would be contrary to  fairness and justice. Moreover, the central principle guiding for the  present the administration of the Cause has been to make the Baha'i  National Spiritual Assemblies as independent as possible in the conduct of  such affairs as fall within their province, and to lessen the hampering  influence of any institution within their jurisdiction that might, whether  directly or indirectly, impair their authority and prestige.          Membership Roll      I would also strongly urge the members of every incoming National  Spiritual Assembly to take all necessary steps to insure that every local  Assembly throughout America, without any exception whatsoever, should  immediately after its election send the complete list of its members  together with the full address of its secretary to the National Secretary,  who in turn will forward them to me directly, enclosing his own address as  well as the list of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. It  would also be extremely helpful, should actual circumstances permit, to  devise with the wholehearted assistance of every local Assembly ways and  means for the compilation of an authoritative, up-to-date, and exhaustive  list of recognized believers in America, supplemented by the full address  of each believer's permanent residence--this list to be continually revised  according to every change affecting the residence and number of such  believers. This would be particularly advisable in view of the permanent  residence of isolated believers in various parts of the country, as well  as of those who form parts of groups as yet numerically too small for the  formation of a local Spiritual Assembly.    However desirable these steps may be, it is evident that they are  secondary in their importance and urgency to the pressing and  ever-increasing issues that vitally affect the spread and the  consolidation of the work which you are called upon to perform, and which  it is my privilege to assist in and serve. I am enclosing a preliminary  list of Baha'i centers throughout the world, exclusive of Persia, which,  though inadequate, may still, I trust, be of some help to you. I would  welcome any additions or corrections you might be able to make and hope it  will evolve into a valuable section of the contemplated Baha'i Year Book.    I wish to assure you, in conclusion, of my heartfelt appreciation of your  devoted labors in the Divine Vineyard.    Your brother and fellow-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  May 12, 1925.          Letter of June 3rd, 1925.      To the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful, the delegates and  visitors to the Baha'i Convention, Green Acre, Maine, U.S.A.    Fellow-laborers in the Vineyard of God:    Once again the hand of divine power has gathered together the chosen  representatives of the American believers, assembled this time amid the  pleasant surroundings of a blest and beloved spot, to deliberate upon the  most effective measures that will insure the advancement of the Cause of  Baha'u'llah. I feel it a pleasure and privilege to offer you these few  thoughts as my humble contribution to the proceedings of your annual  Convention.    May I at the outset reaffirm my feelings of gratitude and keen  appreciation for the eminent share which the friends in America,  individually as well as by their collective efforts, have contributed to  ease the burden of responsibility and care that has so often oppressed my  heart. Your steadfastness, your unsparing devotion; your self-sacrifice in  upholding and fostering the institutions of the Cause; the notable advance  you have achieved in the coordination of your activities; the remarkable  solicitude you have shown, and the magnificent response you have made on  behalf of the oppressed and needy among your brethren; the measures you  have initiated, the hindrances "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#19)"],[1,"less grave than those which threatened the World Center of the  Faith under 'Abdu'l-Hamid and Jamal Pa_sh_a and through Hitler's intended  capture of the Near East, averted. Independent sovereign state within  confines of Holy Land established and recognized, marking termination of  twenty-century-long provincial status. Formal assurance of the protection  of Baha'i holy sites and continuation of Baha'i pilgrimage given by Prime  Minister of newly emerged state. Official invitation extended by its  government on the historic occasion of the opening of the state's first  parliament. Official record of Baha'i marriage endorsed, Baha'i endowments  exempted by responsible authorities of the same state. Best wishes for the  future welfare of the Faith of Baha'u'llah conveyed in writing by the  newly elected head of the state in reply to congratulatory message  addressed him upon assumption of his office. Appeal to entire community,  through assembled delegates, in thankful recognition of the manifold  blessings vouchsafed the Faith and in response to the alert sounded for  the present emergency, to arise and demonstrate more conspicuously than  ever before, through greater austerity at home and increasing audacity in  foreign fields, both in Latin America and Europe, their grim determination  at whatever cost, no matter how crucial the test, however long the period,  however herculean the labor, to carry forward unremittingly their task to  its triumphant conclusion.    [April 25, 1949]            WELCOME INITIAL VICTORY      Greatly welcome, much impressed by remarkable feat of initial victory  collectively achieved by self-sacrificing efforts of invincible,  far-visioned, forward-marching American Baha'i Community. Ultimate victory  now in sight bidding fair to bring present emergency period to triumphant  conclusion, seal fate of Second Seven Year Plan and open prospect of  glorious inauguration at appointed time of third collective Plan designed  to terminate initial chapter in story of mysterious unfoldment of Divine  Plan. Rejoice particularly at formulation of teaching plans so vitally  linked with immediate destiny of Temple enterprise. Owing to relaxation of  pressure occasioned by critical situation advise direct special attention  to invigorate activities conducted in Latin America and European  continent. Need for voluntary, self-supporting, wholly dedicated pioneers  calculated to supplement newly launched undertaking in both fields is  still pressing and acquiring greater urgency owing to approaching  emergence of Latin American national assemblies and necessity to  consolidate swiftly the newly-formed local assemblies in ten European goal  countries. Heart uplifted at contemplation of mighty range of  accomplishments embracing so vast a field in both hemispheres. Prayers  continually ascending to Abha throne both in thanksgiving for marvelous  bounties already vouchsafed and in supplication for renewal of strength  for attainment of future goals.    [June 29, 1949]            SUPPLICATING BLESSING FOR AMERICAN ACTIVITIES      Delighted by progress of Temple work. Highly approve, deeply appreciate  suggestion to defray expenses of German representative to Brussels  conference. Supplicating Almighty's blessing for manifold activities  pursued, unrelaxing vigilance, unflinching determination, exemplary  self-sacrifice in three continents by divinely sustained American Baha'i  Community.    [July 20, 1949]            CORNERS OF SHRINE ARCADE UNDER CONSTRUCTION      Inform friends of commencement of construction on three corners of arcade  of Shrine. Six granite pilasters already erected, twelve columns will be  raised shortly. Forwarding photographs for publicity purposes.    [August 7, 1949]            THIS HOUR, CROWDED WITH DESTINY      The efforts exerted, and the results achieved, by the members of the  American Baha'i Community during the opening months of the two-year  emergency period are such as to merit the highest commendation and praise.  They will, if the effort be sustained, evoke the admiration of the entire  Baha'i world, which is now watching, with feelings of wonder and  expectancy, the outcome of the tremendous labor of this community now  confronted with one of the most challenging, arduous and far-reaching  tasks ever undertaken in its history.    The great forward stride that has already been undertaken, during so short  a period, augurs well for the ultimate victory, now within sight--a victory  which will pave the way for the successful execution of a seven-year  enterprise, destined, in its turn, to enable its executors to launch, at  the appointed time, the third and most glorious stage in the initial  unfoldment of 'Abdu'l-Baha's unique and grand design for that privileged  and conspicuously blessed community.    No less striking has been the achievement of the representatives of this  community in the vast and most recent field of their historic and highly  meritorious endeavors, exerted beyond the confines of their homeland,  where over so vast a territory, on a continent so agitated, and amidst  peoples so disillusioned, so varied in race, language and outlook, so  impoverished spiritually, so paralyzed with fear, so confused in thought,  so abased in their moral standards, so rent by internal schisms, victories  so rich in promise, so startling in their rapidity, so magnificent in  their range, have been won, and ennobled, to such a marked degree, the  deathless record of American Baha'i service to the Faith of Baha'u'llah.    Now that so prodigious and successful an effort has been exerted on behalf  of the historic and sacred Temple, whose completion constitutes so vital  an objective of the Second Seven Year Plan, and so conspicuous a triumph  won in the transatlantic sphere of its operation, its needs and other  vital objectives, both at home and in the Latin American field, must  receive, in the months immediately ahead, the particular attention of both  the national elected representatives of the community who supervise the  working of the Plan and the mass of believers who participate in its  execution.    While the financial requirements of the Mother Temple of the West are  being met with unabated heroism by rich and poor alike in the critical  months that lie ahead, and the measures to ensure the undiminished  support, and the uninterrupted consolidation of the European enterprise  are being assiduously carried out, a parallel effort, no less strenuous  and sustained should be simultaneously exerted in the North American  continent and in Central and South America, for the purpose of preserving  the prizes already won over the length and breadth of the Western  Hemisphere, where the initial impulse of this mighty and Divine Plan has  been felt and its initial victories in foreign fields registered.    The assemblies of the North American continent, constituting the base for  the gigantic operations destined to warm and illuminate, under American  Baha'i auspices, the five continents of the globe, must, at no time and  under no circumstances, be allowed to diminish in number or decline in  strength and in influence. The movement of pioneers, whether settlers or  itinerant teachers, which in fields so distant from this base, has  exhibited so marvelous a vitality, must, within the limits of the homeland  itself, be neither interrupted nor suffer a decline. The groups and  isolated centers so painstakingly formed and established must, conjointly  with this highly commendable and essential duty, be maintained, fostered  and if possible multiplied.    No less attention, while this emergency period taxes, to an unprecedented  degree, the combined resources of the envied trustees of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  Divine Plan, should be directed to the vast network of Baha'i enterprises  initiated throughout Latin America, where the work so nobly conceived, so  diligently prosecuted, so conspicuously blessed, is rapidly nearing the  first stage of its fruition. The flow of pioneers, so vital in all its  aspects, and which has yielded such inestimable benefits at the early  stages of this widely ramified enterprise, must, however urgent the other  tasks already shouldered by an overburdened yet unfailingly protected  community, be neither arrested nor slacken. The outpost of the newly born  communities, established in the Straits of Magallanes in the South, must  be held with undiminished vigor and determination. The major task of  ensuring the breadth and solidity of the foundations laid for the  establishment of two national Baha'i assemblies, through the preservation  of the present assemblies, groups and isolated centers, and the  restoration of any of these vital centers, now dissolved, to their former  status, must be scrupulously watched and constantly encouraged. The  process of the dissemination of Baha'i literature, of Baha'i publication  and translation, must continue unabated, however much the sacrifice  involved. The newly fledged institutions of teaching and regional  committees, of summer schools and of congresses, must be continually  encouraged and increasingly supported by teachers as well as  administrators, by pioneers from abroad, as well as by the native  believers themselves. The highly salutary and spiritually beneficent  experiment of encouraging a more active participation by these newly won  supporters of the Faith in Latin America, and a greater assumption of  administrative responsibility on their part, in the ever expanding  activities to be entrusted wholly to their care in the years to come,  should be, in particular, developed, systematized and placed on a sure and  unassailable foundation. Above all, the paramount duty of deepening the  spiritual life of these newly fledged, these precious and highly esteemed  co-workers, and of enlightening their minds regarding the essential  verities enshrined in their Faith, its fundamental institutions, its"]]]
