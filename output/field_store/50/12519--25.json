A young warrior  was let down into the profound tomb by a cord, which was drawn up  shortly after, in hopes of news from beneath. But when the adventurer  descended, some one threw him from the cord, and took his place in the  noose. When the rope was pulled up, the soldiers, instead of their  companion, beheld Asmund, the survivor of the brethren-in-arms. He  rushed into the open air, his sword drawn in his hand, his armour half  torn from his body, the left side of his face almost scratched off, as  by the talons of some wild beast. He had no sooner appeared in the light  of day, than, with the improvisatory poetic talent, which these  champions often united with heroic strength and bravery, he poured forth  a string of verses containing the history of his hundred years' conflict  within the tomb. It seems that no sooner was the sepulchre closed than  the corpse of the slain Assueit arose from the ground, inspired by some  ravenous goule, and having first torn to pieces and devoured the horses  which had been entombed with them, threw himself upon the companion who  had just given him such a sign of devoted friendship, in order to treat  him in the same manner. The hero, no way discountenanced by the horrors  of his situation, took to his arms, and defended himself manfully  against Assueit, or rather against the evil demon who tenanted that  champion's body. In this manner the living brother waged a preternatural  combat, which had endured during a whole century, when Asmund, at last  obtaining the victory, prostrated his enemy, and by driving, as he  boasted, a stake through his body, had finally reduced him to the state  of quiet becoming a tenant of the tomb. Having chanted the triumphant  account of his contest and victory, this mangled conqueror fell dead  before them. The body of Assueit was taken out of the tomb, burnt, and  the ashes dispersed to heaven; whilst that of the victor, now lifeless  and without a companion, was deposited there, so that it was hoped his  slumbers might remain undisturbed.[19] The precautions taken against  Assueit's reviving a second time, remind us of those adopted in the  Greek islands and in the Turkish provinces against the vampire. It  affords also a derivation of the ancient English law in case of suicide,  when a stake was driven through the body, originally to keep it secure  in the tomb.    [Footnote 19: See Saxo Grammaticus, \"Hist. Dan.,\" lib. v.]    The Northern people also acknowledged a kind of ghosts, who, when they  had obtained possession of a building, or the right of haunting it, did  not defend themselves against mortals on the knightly principle of duel,  like Assueit, nor were amenable to the prayers of the priest or the  spells of the sorcerer, but became tractable when properly convened in a  legal process. The Eyrbiggia Saga acquaints us, that the mansion of a  respectable landholder in Iceland was, soon after the settlement of that  island, exposed to a persecution of this kind. The molestation was  produced by the concurrence of certain mystical and spectral phenomena,  calculated to introduce such persecution. About the commencement of  winter, with that slight exchange of darkness and twilight which  constitutes night and day in these latitudes, a contagious disease arose  in a family of consequence and in the neighbourhood, which, sweeping off  several members of the family at different times, seemed to threaten  them all with death. But the death of these persons was attended with  the singular consequence that their spectres were seen to wander in the  neighbourhood of the mansion-house, terrifying, and even assaulting,  those of the living family who ventured abroad. As the number of the  dead members of the devoted household seemed to increase in proportion  to that of the survivors, the ghosts took it upon them to enter the  house, and produce their aerial forms and wasted physiognomy, even in  the stove where the fire was maintained for the general use of the  inhabitants, and which, in an Iceland winter, is the only comfortable  place of assembling the family. But the remaining inhabitants of the  place, terrified by the intrusion of these spectres, chose rather to  withdraw to the other extremity of the house, and abandon their warm  seats, than to endure the neighbourhood of the phantoms. Complaints were  at length made to a pontiff of the god Thor, named Snorro, who exercised  considerable influence in the island. By his counsel, the young  proprietor of the haunted mansion assembled a jury, or inquest, of his  neighbours, constituted in the usual judicial form, as if to judge an  ordinary civil matter, and proceeded, in their presence, to cite  individually the various phantoms and resemblances of the deceased  members of the family, to show by what warrant they disputed with him  and his servants the quiet possession of his property, and what defence  they could plead for thus interfering with and incommoding the living.  The spectres of the dead, by name, and in order as summoned, appeared on  their being called, and muttering some regrets at being obliged to  abandon their dwelling, departed, or vanished, from the astonished  inquest. Judgment then went against the ghosts by default; and the trial  by jury, of which we here can trace the origin, obtained a triumph  unknown to any of the great writers who have made it the subject of  eulogy.[20]    [Footnote 20: Eyrbiggia Saga. See \"Northern Antiquities.\"]    It was not only with the spirits of the dead that the warlike people of  the North made war without timidity, and successfully entered into suits  of ejectment. These daring champions often braved the indignation even  of the superior deities of their mythology, rather than allow that there  existed any being before whom their boldness could quail. Such is the  singular story how a young man of high courage, in crossing a desolate  ridge of mountains, met with a huge waggon, in which the goddess, Freya  (_i.e._, a gigantic idol formed to represent her), together with her  shrine, and the wealthy offerings attached to it, was travelling from  one district of the country to another. The shrine, or sanctuary of the  idol, was, like a modern caravan travelling with a show, screened by  boards and curtains from the public gaze, and the equipage was under the  immediate guidance of the priestess of Freya, a young, good-looking, and  attractive woman. The traveller naturally associated himself with the  priestess, who, as she walked on foot, apparently was in no degree  displeased with the company of a powerful and handsome young man, as a  guide and companion on the journey. It chanced, however, that the  presence of the champion, and his discourse with the priestess, was less  satisfactory to the goddess than to the parties principally concerned.  By a certain signal the divinity summoned the priestess to the  sanctuary, who presently returned, with tears in her eyes and terror in  her countenance, to inform her companion that it was the will of Freya  that he should depart, and no longer travel in their company. \"You must  have mistaken the meaning of the goddess,\" said the champion; \"Freya  cannot have formed a wish so unreasonable as to desire I should abandon  the straight and good road, which leads me directly on my journey, to  choose precipitous paths and by-roads, where I may break my neck.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said the priestess, \"the goddess will be highly offended  if you disobey her commands, nor can I conceal from you that she may  personally assault you.\" \"It will be at her own peril if she should be  so audacious,\" said the champion, \"for I will try the power of this axe  against the strength of beams and boards.\" The priestess chid him for  his impiety; but being unable to compel him to obey the goddess's  mandate, they again relapsed into familiarity, which advanced to such a  point that a clattering noise within the tabernacle, as of machinery put  in motion, intimated to the travellers that Freya, who perhaps had some  qualities in common with the classical Vesta, thought a personal  interruption of this tete-a-tete ought to be deferred no longer. The  curtains flew open, and the massive and awkward idol, who, we may  suppose, resembled in form the giant created by Frankenstein, leapt  lumbering from the carriage, and, rushing on the intrusive traveller,  dealt him, with its wooden hands and arms, such tremendous blows, as  were equally difficult to parry or to endure. But the champion was armed  with a double-edged Danish axe, with which he bestirred himself with so  much strength and activity, that at length he split the head of the  image, and with a severe blow hewed off its left leg. The image of Freya  then fell motionless to the ground, and the demon which had animated it  fled yelling from the battered tenement. The champion was now victor;  and, according to the law of arms, took possession of the female and the  baggage. The priestess, the divinity of whose patroness had been by the  event of the combat sorely lessened in her eyes, was now easily induced  to become the associate and concubine of the conqueror. She accompanied  him to the district whither he was travelling, and there displayed the  shrine of Freya, taking care to hide the injuries which the goddess had  received in the brawl. The champion came in for a share of a gainful  trade driven by the priestess, besides appropriating to himself most of  the treasures which the sanctuary had formerly contained. Neither does  it appear that Freya, having, perhaps, a sensible recollection of the  power of the axe, ever again ventured to appear in person for the  purpose of calling her false stewards to account.    The national estimation of deities, concerning whom such stories could  be told and believed, was,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#19)"],[1,"Boer gun, and  the short, sharp, hammering noise from the enemy's one-pounder Maxim.  The sun was almost down when the burgher in charge gave the signal to  bring up their horses, and in a few minutes we were under way. This time  I was attended by a bodyguard of about eighteen or twenty burghers, and  we went along, much to my annoyance, at a funereal pace. On our way we  met the relieving guard coming out to take the place just evacuated by  my escort. When seen riding thus more or less in ranks, a Boer squadron,  composed of picked men for outpost duty, presented really a formidable  appearance. The men were mostly of middle age, all with the inevitable  grizzly beard, and their rifles, gripped familiarly, were resting on the  saddle-bow; nearly all had two bandoliers apiece, which gave them the  appearance of being armed to the teeth--a more determined-looking band  cannot be imagined. The horses of these burghers were well bred and in  good condition, and, although their clothes were threadbare, they seemed  cheerful enough, smoking their pipes and cracking their jokes.    When we at last drew up at headquarters, I was fairly startled to find  what an excitement my appearance created, about two or three hundred  Boers swarming up from all over the laager, and surrounding the cart.  The General was then accommodated in a deserted farmhouse, and from this  building at last issued his secretary, a gentleman who spoke English  perfectly, and to whom I handed my letter requesting an interview. After  an interminable wait among the gaping crowd, the aforementioned  gentleman returned, and informed me I could see the General at once. He  literally had to make a way for me from the cart to the house, but I  must admit the burghers were very civil, nearly all of them taking off  their hats as I passed through them. Once inside the house, I found  myself in a low, dark room, and in the farthest corner, seated on a  bench, were two old gentlemen, with extra long beards, who were  introduced to me as General Snyman and Commandant Botha.[33] I was at  once struck by the anything but affable expression of their  countenances. They motioned to me to take a chair; someone handed me a  bowl with a brown mixture--presumably coffee--which I found very  embarrassing to hold during our conversation. This was carried on  through the secretary, and the General got more and more out of temper  as he discovered what my request was. I informed him I had come at the  suggestion of his _Veldtcornet_; that all my relations were in England,  except my husband, who was in Mafeking; that there was no meal in the  colony where I had been living; and that I was prepared to ask Colonel  Baden-Powell to exchange me for a Dutch lady whom I heard wished to  leave, if he (General Snyman) would accept the exchange. He promptly and  with much decision refused. Then it occurred to me this old gentleman  meant to keep me as a prisoner of war, and my heart sank into my shoes.  The only concession I could obtain was that he would consider my case,  and in the meantime he ordered that I should be accommodated in the  field hospital. Accompanied by the secretary, and leaving the staring  crowd behind, I drove off to a little house, about half a mile away,  where we found our destination. I was shown into a tiny room, smelling  strongly of disinfectants, which from the large centre-table I at once  recognized as the operating-room, and here I was told I could sleep. I  was too tired to care much. There was no bed, only a broken-down sofa,  and in the corner a dilapidated washstand; the walls and windows were  riddled with bullets, denoting where the young burghers had been amusing  themselves with rifle practice. The secretary then informed me that they  had to search my luggage, which operation lasted fully half an hour,  although I had but one small portmanteau and a dressing-case. The latter  two Dutch nurses were told off to look through, which, I am bound to  say, they did most unwillingly, remarking to me they had not  contemplated searching people's luggage as part of their already onerous  duties. I had even to undress, in order that they might reassure the  officials I had no documents on my person. Meanwhile the men examined my  correspondence and papers almost microscopically. Needless to say, they  found nothing. They had barely finished their researches, when a  messenger came from the General to say, if Colonel Baden-Powell would  exchange me for a Dutchman imprisoned in Mafeking, a certain Petrus  Viljoen, he would consent to my going in. I found, on inquiry, that this  man had been imprisoned for theft several months before the war, and I  told them plainly it was manifestly unfair to exchange a man and a  criminal for a woman; further, that I could not even ask Colonel  Baden-Powell officially to do such a thing, and could only mention it,  as an impossible condition, in a letter to my husband, if they chose to  send it in. To this they agreed, so I indited the following letter,  couched in terms which the secretary might peruse:           \"_December 2, 1899._         \"MY DEAR GORDON,         \"I am at the laager. General Snyman will not give me a pass       unless Colonel Baden-Powell will exchange me for a Mr. Petrus       Viljoen. I am sure this is impossible, so I do not ask him       formally. I am in a great fix, as they have very little meal       left at Setlagoli or the surrounding places. I am very kindly       looked after here.\"    I then went to sleep in my strange surroundings, with small hope of any  success from my application to Mafeking. The next day, Sunday, was  observed by both parties as a day of rest. About seven one of the nurses  brought me a cup of coffee, and then I proceeded to dress as best I  might. So clearly did that horrid little room imprint itself on my  memory that I seem to see it as I write. The dusty bare boards, cracked  and loose in places, had no pretence to any acquaintance with a  scrubbing-brush, and very little with a broom. A rickety old chest of  drawers stood in one corner, presumably filled with hospital  necessaries, from the very strong smell of drugs emanating from it, and  from the fact that the nurses would bustle in and rummage for some  desired article, giving glimpses of the confusion inside. On the top of  the drawers were arranged a multitude of medicine-bottles, half full and  half empty, cracked and whole. The broken old washstand had been of  valuable service during the night, as with it I barricaded the door,  innocent of any lock or key. When I was dressed, I walked out on to the  tiny stoep, surrounded by a high paling. My attention was at once  attracted to a woman in a flood of tears, and presently the cause of her  weeping was explained, as an elderly man came round the corner of the  house with both his hands roughly tied up with bandages covered with  blood--a sight which caused the young woman to sob with renewed vigour.  After a little talk with the man, who, in spite of his injuries, seemed  perfectly well, the latter went away, and I entered into conversation  with the weeping female, whom I found to speak good English, and to be  the daughter of the wounded warrior, Hoffman by name and German by  birth. They were Transvaal subjects, and her father had been among the  first of the burghers to turn out when hostilities threatened. She then  proceeded to tell me that she and her mother and a numerous collection  of young brothers and sisters had trekked in from their home in the  Transvaal to spend the Sunday in the laager with their father. On their  arrival early that morning, they learnt, to their horror, that he had  been wounded, or, rather, injured, late the night before, as the  mutilated state of his hands arose from a shell exploding in the  high-velocity Krupp gun just as he was loading it. She told me her  father was one of the most valued artillerymen on the Boer side, and  that he was also an adept in the art of making fireworks, his last  triumph in this line having been at Mafeking on the occasion of the  celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Fully appreciating the  value of his services, the Transvaal authorities had from the  commencement given him the most arduous tasks, and always, she  indignantly added, in the forefront of the battle. As regarded the  present accident, she said her father had repeatedly told the  authorities these particular shells were not safe to handle. Apparently  the safety-bolt was missing from all of them, making them when loaded as  brittle as an eggshell. This young lady and her mother were certainly  very anti-Boer in their sympathies, though terribly afraid of allowing  their feelings to be known. All that day and the next they spent in the  laager, looking after the injured _pere de famille_, whom, by the way, I  got quite friendly with, but who, I think, was rather relieved to see  his family depart. I rather regretted them, as Miss Hoffman used to  bring me a lot of gossip overheard in the laager, where she assured me  public opinion was running very strongly against me, and that all were  of opinion the General should certainly not allow me to join my friends  in Mafeking.    The morning dragged on. It was a hot, gusty day, and I found the shelter  of my poky little room the most comfortable resting-place, although  instead of a chair I had but a wooden case to sit on. About eleven I saw  a clerical gentleman arriving, who I rightly concluded was the parson  coming to conduct the service. Presently the strangest of noises I have  ever heard arose from the back-premises of the tiny house. It is  difficult to conceive anything so grotesque as some Dutch singing is.  Imagine a doleful wail of many voices, shrill treble and deep bass, all  on one note, now swelling in volume, now almost dying away, sung with a  certain metre, and presumably with soul-stirring words, but with no  attempt to keep"]]]
