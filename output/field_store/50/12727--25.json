Edward VI,[v***] and Queen Elizabeth,[v****] who had both of them made  use of this expedient for raising money, had summoned only those who  were possessed of forty pounds a year and upwards to receive knighthood,  or compound for their neglect; and Charles imitated their example, in  granting the same indulgence.         * Clarendon, vol. i. p. 4.

Commissioners were appointed for fixing the rates of composition; and  instructions were given to these commissioners not to accept of a less  sum than would have been due by the party upon a tax of three subsidies  and a half.[*] Nothing proves more plainly how ill disposed the people  were to the measures of the crown, than to observe that they loudly  complained of an expedient founded on positive statute, and warranted  by such recent precedents. The law was pretended to be obsolete; though  only one reign had intervened since the last execution of it.    Barnard, lecturer of St. Sepulchre's, London, used this expression in  his prayer before sermon: \"Lord, open the eyes of the queen's majesty,  that she may see Jesus Christ, whom she has pierced with her infidelity,  superstition, and idolatry.\" He was questioned in the high commission  court for this insult on the queen; but, upon his submission,  dismissed.[**] Leighton, who had written libels against the king, the  queen, the bishops, and the whole administration, was condemned by  a very severe, if not a cruel sentence; but the execution of it was  suspended for some time, in expectation of his submission.[***] All  the severities, indeed, of this reign were exercised against those  who triumphed in their sufferings, who courted persecution, and braved  authority; and on that account their punishment may be deemed the more  just, but the less prudent. To have neglected them entirely, had it been  consistent with order and public safety, had been the wisest measure  that could have been embraced; as perhaps it had been the most severe  punishment that could have been inflicted on these zealots.    {1631.} In order to gratify the clergy with a magnificent fabric,  subscriptions were set on foot for repairing and rebuilding St. Paul's;  and the king, by his countenance and example, encouraged this laudable  undertaking.[****] By order of the privy council, St. Gregory's  church was removed, as an impediment to the project of extending and  beautifying the cathedral. Some houses and shops likewise were pulled  down, and compensation was made to the owners.[v]         * Rush. vol. ii. p. 70, 71, 72.

As there was no immediate prospect of assembling a parliament, such acts  of power in the king became necessary; and in no former age would the  people have entertained any scruple with regard to them. It must be  remarked, that the Puritans were extremely averse to the raising of  this ornament to the capital. It savored, as they pretended, of Popish  superstition.    A stamp duty was imposed on cards; a new tax, which of itself was liable  to no objection, but appeared of dangerous consequence when considered  as arbitrary and illegal.[*]    Monopolies were revived; an oppressive method of levying money, being  unlimited, as well as destructive of industry. The last parliament of  James, which abolished monopolies, had left an equitable exception in  favor of new inventions; and on pretence of these, and of erecting  new companies and corporations, was this grievance now renewed. The  manufacture of soap was given to a company who paid a sum for their  patent.[**] Leather, salt, and many other commodities, even down to  linen rags, were likewise put under restrictions.    It is affirmed by Clarendon, that so little benefit was reaped from  these projects, that of two hundred thousand pounds thereby levied on  the people, scarcely one thousand five hundred came into the king's  coffers. Though we ought not to suspect the noble historian of  exaggerations to the disadvantage of Charles's measures, this fact, it  must be owned, appears somewhat incredible. The same author adds, that  the king's intention was to teach his subjects how unthrifty a thing it  was to refuse reasonable supplies to the crown: an imprudent project:  to offend a whole nation under the view of punishment: and to hope  by acts of violence to break their refractory spirits, without being  possessed of any force to prevent resistance.    {1632.} The council of York had been first erected, after a rebellion,  by a patent from Henry VIII., without any authority of parliament; and  this exercise cf power, like many others, was indulged to that arbitrary  monarch. This council had long acted chiefly as a criminal court; but,  besides some innovations introduced by James, Charles thought proper  some time after Wentworth was made president, to extend its powers,  and to give it a large civil jurisdiction, and that in some respects  discretionary.[***]         * Rush. vol. ii. p. 103.         ** Rush. vol. ii. p. 136, 142, 189, 252.         *** Rush. vol. ii. p, 158, 159, etc. Franklyn, p. 412.    It is not improbable, that the king's intention was only to prevent  inconveniencies, which arose from the bringing of every cause, from  the most distant parts of the kingdom, into Westminster Hall: but the  consequence, in the mean time, of this measure, was the putting of  all the northern counties out of the protection of ordinary law, and  subjecting them to an authority somewhat arbitrary. Some irregular acts  of that council were this year complained of.[*]    {1633.} The court of star chamber extended its authority; and it was  matter of complaint that it encroached upon the jurisdiction of the  other courts; imposing heavy fines and inflicting severe punishment,  beyond the usual course of justice. Sir David Foulis was fined  five thousand pounds, chiefly because he had dissuaded a friend  from compounding with the commissioners of knighthood.[**]         * Rush. vol. ii. p. 202, 203.         ** Rush, vol. ii. p. 215, 216, etc.    Prynne, a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, had written an enormous quarto of  a thousand pages, which he called Histrio-Mastyx. Its professed purpose  was to decry stage-plays, comedies, interludes, music, dancing; but  the author likewise took occasion to declaim against hunting, public  festivals, Christmas-keeping, bonfires, and may-poles. His zeal against  all these levities, he says, was first moved by observing that plays  sold better than the choicest sermons, and that they were frequently  printed on finer paper than the Bible itself. Besides, that the players  were often Papists, and desperately wicked; the play-houses, he affirms,  are Satan's chapels; the play-haunters little better than incarnate  devils; and so many steps in a dance, so many paces to hell. The chief  crime of Nero, he represents to have been his frequenting and acting of  plays; and those who nobly conspired his death, were principally moved  to it, as he affirms, by their indignation at that enormity. The rest of  his thousand pages is of a like strain. He had obtained a license from  Archbishop Abbot's chaplain; yet was he indicted in the star chamber as  a libeller. It was thought somewhat hard that general invectives against  plays should be interpreted into satires against the king and queen,  merely because they frequented these amusements, and because the  queen sometimes acted a part in pastorals and interludes which were  represented at court. The author, it must be owned, had, in plainer  terms, blamed the hierarchy, the ceremonies, the innovations in  religious worship, and the new superstitions introduced by Laud;[*]  and this, probably, together with the obstinacy and petulance of his  behavior before the star chamber, was the reason why his sentence was so  severe. He was condemned to be put from the bar; to stand on the pillory  in two places, Westminster and Cheapside; to lose both his ears, one  in each place; to pay five thousand pounds' fine to the king; and to be  imprisoned during life.[**]    This same Prynne was a great hero among the Puritans; and it was  chiefly with a view of mortifying that sect, that though of an honorable  profession, he was condemned by the star chamber to so ignominious a  punishment. The thorough-paced Puritans were distinguishable by the  sourness and austerity of their manners, and by their aversion to  all pleasure and society.[***] To inspire them with better humor was  certainly, both for their own sake and that of the public, a laudable  intention in the court; but whether pillories, fines and prisons were  proper expedients for that purpose, may admit of some question.    Another expedient which the king tried, in order to infuse cheerfulness  into the national devotion, was not much more successful. He renewed his  father's edict for allowing sports and recreations on Sunday to such  as attended public worship; and he ordered his proclamation for that  purpose to be publicly read by the clergy after divine service.[****]  Those who were Puritanically affected refused obedience, and were  punished by suspension or deprivation. The differences between the  sects were before sufficiently great; nor was it necessary to widen them  further by these inventions.    Some encouragement and protection which the king and the bishops gave  to wakes, church ales, bride ales, and other cheerful festivals of the  common people, were the objects of like scandal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19216"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part F. (#19)"],[1,"by Burnet, archbishop of Glasgow; but not being immediately  delivered to the council by Sharpe, the president,[**] one Maccail had  in the interval been put to the torture, under which he expired. He  seemed to die in an ecstasy of joy. \"Farewell, sun, moon, and stars;  farewell, world and time; farewell, weak and frail body: welcome,  eternity; welcome, angels and saints; welcome, Savior of the world; and  welcome, God, the Judge of all!\" Such were his last words: and these  animated speeches he uttered with an accent and manner which struck all  the bystanders with astonishment.         * Burnet, p 237.         * Wodrow's History, vol. i. p. 255.    The settlement of Ireland, after the restoration, was a work of greater  difficulty than that of England, or even of Scotland. Not only the  power, during the former usurpations, had there been vested in the  king's enemies; the whole property, in a manner, of the kingdom had also  been changed: and it became necessary to redress, but with as little  violence as possible, many grievous hardships and iniquities which were  there complained of.    The Irish Catholics had in 1648 concluded a treaty with Ormond, the  king's lieutenant; in which they had stipulated pardon for their past  rebellion, and had engaged, under certain conditions, to assist the  royal cause: and though the violence of the priests and the bigotry  of the people had prevented, in a great measure, the execution of this  treaty, yet were there many, who, having strictly, at the hazard of  their lives, adhered to it, seemed on that account well entitled to  reap the fruits of their loyalty. Cromwell, having without distinction  expelled all the native Irish from the three provinces of Munster,  Leinster, and Ulster, had confined them to Connaught and the county  of Clare; and among those who had thus been forfeited, were many whose  innocence was altogether unquestionable. Several Protestants likewise,  and Ormond among the rest, had all along opposed the Irish rebellion;  yet having afterwards embraced the king's cause against the parliament,  they were all of them attainted by Cromwell. And there were many  officers who had from the commencement of the insurrection served in  Ireland, and who, because they would not desert the king, had been  refused all their arrears by the English commonwealth.    To all these unhappy sufferers some justice seemed to be due: but the  difficulty was, to find the means of redressing such great and extensive  iniquities. Almost all the valuable parts of Ireland had been measured  out and divided, either to the adventurers, who had lent money to  the parliament for the suppression of the Irish rebellion, or to the  soldiers, who had received land in lieu of their arrears. These could  not be dispossessed, because they were the most powerful and only armed  part of Ireland; because it was requisite to favor them, in order to  support the Protestant and English interest in that kingdom; and because  they had generally, with a seeming zeal and alacrity, concurred in the  king's restoration. The king, therefore, issued a proclamation, in which  he promised to maintain their settlement, and at the same time engaged  to give redress to the innocent sufferers. There was a quantity of land  as yet undivided in Ireland; and from this and some other funds, it was  thought possible for the king to fulfil both these engagements.    A court of claims was erected, consisting altogether of English  commissioners, who had no connection with any of the parties into which  Ireland was divided. Before these were laid four thousand claims of  persons craving restitution on account of their innocence; and the  commissioners had found leisure to examine only six hundred. It already  appeared, that if all these were to be restored, the funds, whence the  adventurers and soldiers must get reprisals, would fall short of giving  them any tolerable satisfaction. A great alarm and anxiety seized all  ranks of men: the hopes and fears of every party were excited: these  eagerly grasped at recovering their paternal inheritance; those were  resolute to maintain their new acquisitions.    The duke of Ormond was created lord lieutenant; being the only person  whose prudence and equity could compose such jarring interests. A  parliament was assembled at Dublin; and as the lower house was almost  entirely chosen by the soldiers and adventurers, who still kept  possession, it was extremely favorable to that interest. The house of  peers showed greater impartiality.    An insurrection was projected, together with a surprisal of the Castle  of Dublin, by some of the disbanded soldiers; but this design was  happily defeated by the vigilance of Ormond. Some of the criminals were  punished. Blood, the most desperate of them, escaped into England.    But affairs could not long remain in the confusion and uncertainty into  which they had fallen. All parties seemed willing to abate somewhat  of their pretensions, in order to attain some stability; and Ormond  interposed his authority for that purpose. The soldiers and adventurers  agreed to relinquish a third of their possessions; and as they had  purchased their lands at very low prices, they had reason to think  themselves favored by this composition. All those who had been attainted  on account of their adhering to the king, were restored; and some of the  innocent Irish. It was a hard situation that a man was obliged to prove  himself innocent, in order to recover possession of the estate which he  and his ancestors had ever enjoyed: but the hardship was augmented by  the difficult conditions annexed to this proof. If the person had ever  lived in the quarters of the rebels, he was not admitted to plead his  innocence; and he was, for that reason alone, supposed to have been a  rebel. The heinous guilt of the Irish nation made men the more readily  overlook any iniquity which might fall on individuals; and it  was considered that, though it be always the interest of all good  governments to prevent injustice, it is not always possible to remedy  it, after it has had a long course, and has been attended with great  successes.    Ireland began to attain a state of some composure, when it was disturbed  by a violent act passed by the English parliament, which prohibited the  importation of Irish cattle into England.[*]         * In 1666.    Ormond remonstrated strongly against this law. He said, that the present  trade carried on between England and Ireland was extremely to the  advantage of the former kingdom, which received only provisions or rude  materials in return for every species of manufacture: that if the cattle  of Ireland were prohibited, the inhabitants of that island had no other  commodity by which they could pay England for their importations, and  must have recourse to other nations for a supply: that the industrious  inhabitants of England, if deprived of Irish provisions, which made  living cheap, would be obliged to augment the price of labor, and  thereby render their manufactures too dear to be exported to foreign  markets: that the indolent inhabitants of Ireland, finding provisions  fall almost to nothing, would never be induced to labor, but would  perpetuate to all generations their native sloth and barbarism: that  by cutting off almost entirely the trade between the kingdoms, all the  natural bands of union were dissolved, and nothing remained to keep the  Irish in their duty but force and violence: and that by reducing that  kingdom to extreme poverty, it would be even rendered incapable of  maintaining that military power, by which, during its well-grounded  discontents, it must necessarily be retained in subjection.    The king was so much convinced of the justness of these reasons, that he  used all his interest to oppose the bill; and he openly declared, that  he could not give his assent to it with a safe conscience. But the  commons were resolute in their purpose. Some of the rents of England  had fallen of late years, which had been ascribed entirely to the  importation of Irish cattle: several intrigues had contributed to  inflame that prejudice, particularly those of Buckingham and Ashley, who  were desirous of giving Ormond disturbance in his government: and the  spirit of tyranny, of which nations are as susceptible as individuals,  had extremely animated the English to exert their superiority over their  dependent state. No affair could be conducted with greater violence than  this was by the commons. They even went so far, in the preamble of the  bill, as to declare the importation of Irish cattle to be a nuisance. By  this expression they gave scope to their passion, and at the same time  barred the king's prerogative, by which he might think himself entitled  to dispense with a law so full of injustice and bad policy. The lords  expunged the word; but as the king was sensible that no supply would be  given by the commons, unless they were gratified in their prejudices,  he was obliged both to employ his interest with the peers for making the  bill pass, and to give the royal assent to it. He could not, however,  forbear expressing his displeasure at the jealousy entertained against  him, and at the intention which the commons discovered of retrenching  his prerogative.    This law brought great distress for some time upon the Irish; but it has  occasioned their applying with greater industry to manufactures, and has  proved in the issue beneficial to that kingdom.            CHAPTER LXV.    [Illustration: 1-802-hyde-park.jpg  HYDE PARK]          CHARLES II.    {1668.} Since the restoration, England had attained a situation which  had never been experienced in any former period of her government,  and which seemed the only one that could fully insure, at once, her  tranquillity and her liberty: the king was in continual want of supply  from the parliament, and he seemed willing to accommodate himself"]]]
