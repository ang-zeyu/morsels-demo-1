On the other hand, in order to lower a tone,  the letter representing it is \"flatted,\" and F is called _Fes_,  G _Ges_, the only exception to these rules being the B which  we have already considered.    In France the Guidonian system was adhered to closely, and  to this day the _becarre_ is used only as an accidental, to  indicate that the note to which it refers has been flatted  before. The _naturel_ (which has the same shape) is used  to designate a note that is natural to the key; thus the  distinction is made between an accidental and a note that is  common to the key. In F major, for instance, B[natural] is  _si becarre_, A[natural] would be _la naturel_. Our modern  sharp is merely another form of the natural or square B  ([natural]) which gradually came to be used before _any_ note,  signifying that it was raised or sharped a half-tone; the flat  lowered it a semitone, and after a while the natural received  its present place between the sharp and flat. The first instance  we have of the sharp being used is in the thirteenth century,  when (in the Rondels of Adam de la Hale) it takes the form  of a cross [x] (the German word for the sharp still remains  _kreuz_). The French word _diese_ (sharp) comes from the Greek  _diesis_, a term used to indicate the raising of the voice in  the chromatic scale.    And now we have to speak of notation and its development.  Thus far we have found only two ways in which musical sounds  were indicated by the ancients. First, we remember the invention  of Aristophanes of Alexandria, his accents, high, low, and  circumflex. Then we know from Ptolemy, Boethius, and Alypius  that letters were used to designate the different tones; but as  there is no music extant in this notation to prove the theory,  we need not trouble ourselves with it.    The system of Aristophanes, however, was destined to become the  nucleus from which our modern notation sprang. We know that  an elementary idea, clearly expressed, has more chances of  living than has a more complicated system, however ingenious  the latter may be. Now this system is so plain that we will  find it is common to many aboriginal peoples, for instance  the American Indians have a system very similar.    In the period now under consideration (from the third to the  tenth century), music was noted in this way: an upstroke of  the pen meant a raising of the voice, a downstroke lowered it,  a flat stroke meant a repetition of the same note, thus [/ \\ -]  [G: c' g' c' c']. Gradually it became necessary to indicate  the contour of the melodies with more accuracy; therefore the  circumflex was added [Over-slur] [G: g' c'' g'] and reversed  [Under-slur] [G: g' e' g']. Still later a sign for two steps was  invented [Step] [G: e' g' b'] and when the progression was to  be diatonically stepwise the strokes were thicker [Thick Step]  [G: g' a' b']. So this notation developed, and by combining  the many signs together, simple non-rhythmic melodies could be  indicated with comparative clearness and simplicity. The flat  stroke for a single note [-], indicating [G: b'], eventually  became smaller and thicker, thus [Thick -]. By combining these  different signs, a skip of a third and back came to be noted  [Crenellation], and if the note came down on a second instead  of the original note it became [Podium] [G: g' b' a']. The  _quilisma_ ([Upper Mordent]) indicated a repetition of two  notes, one above the other, and we still use much the same  sign for our trill. Also the two forms of the circumflex,  [Over-slur] [Under-slur], were joined ([Turn]) and thus we  have the modern turn, so much used by Wagner.    Now while this notation was ingenious, it still left much  to be desired as to pitch. To remedy this a red line was  drawn before writing these signs or _neumes_, as they were  called. This line represented a given pitch, generally E;  above and below it were then written the signs for the notes,  their pitch being determined by the relative position they held  in regard to the _line_. Thus [Podium, Turn, Upper Mordent] was  the equivalent of [G: c' e'  d' e' d' c' d'  e' d' e' d' e' d'],  considering the line as being middle C pitch, a fourth higher F.  This was the condition of musical notation in 1000 A.D.    To Guido d'Arezzo is ascribed its development up to some  semblance of our present system, although the claim has often  been denied. It is certain, however, that the innovations  were made at this period. In the first place Guido made the  red line _always_ stand for the pitch of F, and at a little  distance above it he added another line, this time yellow,  which was to indicate the pitch of C. Thus the signs began to  take very definite meaning as regards pitch; for, given a sign  extending from one line to the other, the reader could see  at a glance that the music progressed a fifth, from F to C,  or _vice-versa_. And now the copyists, seeing the value of  these lines in determining the pitch of the different signs,  of their own account added two more in black ink, one of which  they drew between the F and the C line, and the other above  the C line, thus [illustration]. By doing this they accurately  decided the pitch of every note, for the lowest line, being F,  the line between that and the C line must stand for A, and the  two spaces for G and B; the top line would stand for E, and the  space between it and the yellow line for D. Little by little  these copyists grew careless about making the lines in yellow,  red, and black, and sometimes drew them all in black or red,  thereby losing the distinguishing mark of the F and C lines. In  order to remedy this, Guido placed the letters F and C before  the lines representing these notes, thus [illustration]. In  this way our modern _clefs_ (_clavis_ or key) originated, for  the C clef, as it is called, gradually changed its shape to  [illustration] and [illustration], and the F clef changed to  [illustration], which is our bass clef in a rudimentary form.    Later, still another line was added to the set, thus giving  us our modern staff, and another clef, [illustration], was  added on the next to the lowest line. This, in turn, became  our present treble clef, [G:]. In the course of time the signs  themselves underwent many changes, until at last from [Podium],  etc., they became our modern signs.    Before this, however, a grave defect in the notation had to  be remedied. There was as yet no way of designating the length  of time a note was to be sustained; something definite in the  way of noting _rhythm_ was necessary. This was accomplished  by Franco of Cologne, in the beginning of the thirteenth  century. By disconnecting the parts of the sign [Podium] one  from another, the following individual signs were acquired  [illustration of Podium broken into three pieces]. In order  to have two distinct values of length, these signs were  called longs and shorts, _longa_ [illustration], and _brevis_  [illustration], to which was added the _brevis_ in another  position [illustration], called _semibrevis_. The _longa_  was twice the value of the _brevis_, and the _semibrevis_  was half the length of the _brevis_ ([L = B B   B = S S]).  When notes of equal length were slurred, they were written  [illustration]. When two or more notes were to be sung to  one syllable in quicker time, the _brevi_ were joined one to  the other [illustration], as for instance in the songs of the  thirteenth century,          DIRGE FOR KING RICHARD'S DEATH        GAUCELM FAIDIT.        [Illustration]      [W: Fortz chose est que tot le maur major dam]          ROI THIBAUT DE NAVARRE (1250).        [Illustration]      [W: Si li dis sans de laies | Belle diex vous doint bon jour]    or, in modern style,        [G: g' a' b' c'' (d'' c'') (b' a' g') |          a' b' (c'' b') (b' a' g') (a' b') g']    In this example we find the first indication of the measuring  off of phrases into bars. As we see, it consisted of a little  stroke, which served to show the beginning of a new line,  and was not restricted to regularity of any kind except that  necessitated by the verse.    The use of the _semibrevis_ is shown in the following chanson  of Raoul de Coucy (1192):        [Illustration]      [W: Quant li rossignol jolis | chante          Seur la flor d'este | que n'est la rose et le lis]        [G: d'' (c'' a') b-' (a' (g' f')) g' (a' b-' a' f') f' | f' g'          a' (b-' a') (c'' d'' c'' b-') (a' g') a' |          d'' (c'' a') b-' a' (g' f') g' (a' (b-' a') f') f']    The French troubadours and the German minnesingers of the  thirteenth century used these forms of notes only, and even  then restricted themselves to two kinds, either the _longa_  and _brevis_, or _brevis_ and _semibrevis_.    The necessity for rests very soon manifested itself, and the  following signs were invented to correspond to the _longa_,  _brevis_, and _semibrevis_ [illustration]. Also the number of  note symbols was increased by the _maxima_ or double _longa_  [illustration], and the _minima_ [illustration], which  represented half the value of the _semibrevis_.    Now that music began taking a more definite rhythmic form  than before, a more regular dividing off of the phrases  became necessary. This was accomplished by the use of a  dot, and another form, the perpendicular line, which we  have noticed in the song of the King of Navarre (1250). At  first a means to indicate triple time was invented, and the  measure corresponding to our [9/8] was indicated by placing  the sign [O.] at the beginning of the line. This was called  perfect. Then, for plain triple time the dot was omitted [O];  for [6/8] time the sign [C.] was adopted, and for ordinary  common time [C] was taken. Consequently, when these signs  were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#19)"],[1,"finger, were received by a Gipsy auditor with great faith  and interest.    To show, teach, or learn, is expressed in Gipsy by the word _sikker_,  _sig_, or _seek_.  The reader may not be aware that the Sikhs of India  derive their name from the same root, as appears from the following  extract from Dr Paspati's _etudes_: \"_Sikava_, v. prim. 1 cl. 1 conj.  part, siklo', montrer, apprendre.  Sanskrit, s'iks', to learn, to acquire  science; siksaka, adj., a learner, a teacher.  Hindustani, seek'hna,  v.a., to learn, to acquire; seek'h, s.f., admonition.\"  I next inquired  why they were called Seeks, and they told me it was a word borrowed from  one of the commandments of their founder, which signifies 'learn thou,'  and that it was adopted to distinguish the sect soon after he  disappeared.  The word, as is well known, has the same import in the  Hindoovee\" (\"Asiatic Researches,\" vol. i. p. 293, and vol. ii. p. 200).  This was a noble word to give a name to a body of followers supposed to  be devoted to knowledge and truth.    The English Gipsy calls a mermaid a _pintni_; in Hindu it is _bint ool  buhr_, a maid of the sea.  Bero in Gipsy is the sea or a ship, but the  Rommany had reduced the term to the original _bint_, by which a girl is  known all over the East.       \"Ya bint' Eeskendereyeh.\"    _Stan_ is a word confounded by Gipsies with both _stand_, a place at the  races or a fair, and _tan_, a stopping-place, from which it was probably  derived.  But it agrees in sound and meaning with the Eastern _stan_, \"a  place, station,\" and by application \"country,\" so familiar to the reader  in Hindustan, Iranistan, Beloochistan, and many other names.  It is  curious to find in the Gipsy tan not only the root-word of a tent, but  also the \"Alabama,\" or \"here we rest,\" applied by the world's early  travellers to so many places in the Morning Land.    _Slang_ does _not_ mean, as Mr Hotten asserts, the secret language of the  Gipsies, but is applied by them to acting; to speaking theatrical  language, as in a play; to being an acrobat, or taking part in a show.  It  is a very old Gipsy word, and indicates plainly enough the origin of the  cant word \"slang.\"  Using other men's words, and adopting a conventional  language, strikes a Gipsy as _artificial_; and many men not Gipsies  express this feeling by speaking of conventional stage language as  \"theatrical slang.\"  Its antiquity and origin appear in the Hindu swangi,  an actor; swang, mockery, disguise, sham; and swang lena, to imitate.  As  regards the sound of the words, most English Gipsies would call swang  \"slang\" as faithfully as a Cockney would exchange _hat_ with '_at_.    Deepest among deep words in India is _tat_, an element, a principle, the  essence of being; but it is almost amusing to hear an English Gipsy say  \"that's the tatto (or tat) of it,\" meaning thereby \"the thing itself,\"  the whole of it.  And thus the ultimate point of Brahma, and the infinite  depth of all transcendental philosophy, may reappear in a cheap,  portable, and convenient form, as a declaration that the real meaning of  some mysterious transaction was that it amounted to a sixpenny swindle at  thimble-rig; for to such base uses have the Shaster and the Vedas come in  England.    It is, however, pleasant to find the Persian _bahar_, a garden, recalling  Bahar Danush, the garden of knowledge (Hindustani, bagh), reappearing in  the English Gipsy _bar_.  \"She pirryed adree the bar lellin ruzhers.\"  \"She walked in the garden plucking flowers.\"  And it is also like old  times and the Arabian Nights at home, to know that bazaar is a Gipsy  word, though it be now quite obsolete, and signifies no longer a public  street for shops, but an open field.    But of all words which identify the Gipsies with the East, and which  prove their Hindu origin, those by which they call themselves Rom and  Romni are most conclusive.  In India the Dom caste is one of the lowest,  whose business it is for the men to remove carcasses, while the Domni, or  female Dom, sings at weddings.  Everything known of the Dom identifies  them with Gipsies.  As for the sound of the word, any one need only ask  the first Gipsy whom he meets to pronounce the Hindu _d_ or the word Dom,  and he will find it at once converted into _l_ or _r_.  There are, it is  true, other castes and classes in India, such as Nats, the roving  Banjaree, Thugs, &c., all of which have left unmistakable traces on the  Gipsies, from which I conclude that at some time when these pariahs  became too numerous and dangerous there was a general expulsion of them  from India. {124}    I would call particular attention to my suggestion that the Corn of India  is the true parent of the Rom, because all that is known of the former  caste indicates an affinity between them.  The Dom pariahs of India who  carry out or touch dead bodies, also eat the bodies of animals that have  died a natural death, as do the Gipsies of England.  The occupation of  the Domni and Romni, dancing and making music at festivals, are  strikingly allied.  I was reminded of this at the last opera which I  witnessed at Covent Garden, on seeing stage Gipsies introduced as part of  the fete in \"La Traviata.\"    A curious indication of the Indian origin of the Gipsies may be found in  the fact that they speak of every foreign country beyond sea as the Hindi  tem, Hindi being in Hindustani their own word for Indian.  Nothing was  more natural than that the Rommany on first coming to England should  speak of far-away regions as being the same as the land they had left,  and among such ignorant people the second generation could hardly fail to  extend the term and make it generic.  At present an Irishman is a _Hindi  tem mush_, or Hindu; and it is rather curious, by the way, that a few  years ago in America everything that was _anti_-Irish or native American  received the same appellation, in allusion to the exclusive system of  castes.    Although the Gipsies have sadly confounded the Hindu terms for the  \"cardinal points,\" no one can deny that their own are of Indian origin.  Uttar is north in Hindustani, and Utar is west in Rommany.  As it was  explained to me, I was told that \"Utar means west and wet too, because  the west wind is wet.\"  _Shimal_ is also north in Hindu; and on asking a  Gipsy what it meant, he promptly replied, \"It's where the snow comes  from.\"  _Poorub_ is the east in Hindustani; in Gipsy it is changed to  porus, and means the west.    This confusion of terms is incidental to every rude race, and it must be  constantly borne in mind that it is very common in Gipsy.  Night suggests  day, or black white, to the most cultivated mind; but the Gipsy confuses  the name, and calls yesterday and to-morrow, or light and shadow, by the  same word.  More than this, he is prone to confuse almost all opposites  on all occasions, and wonders that you do not promptly accept and  understand what his own people comprehend.  This is not the case among  the Indians of North America, because oratory, involving the accurate use  of words, is among them the one great art; nor are the negroes, despite  their heedless ignorance, so deficient, since they are at least very fond  of elegant expressions and forcible preaching.  I am positive and  confident that it would be ten times easier to learn a language from the  wildest Indian on the North American continent than from any real English  Gipsy, although the latter may be inclined with all his heart and soul to  teach, even to the extent of passing his leisure days in \"skirmishing\"  about among the tents picking up old Rommany words.  Now the Gipsy has  passed his entire life in the busiest scenes of civilisation, and is  familiar with all its refined rascalities; yet notwithstanding this, I  have found by experience that the most untutored Kaw or Chippewa, as  ignorant of English as I was ignorant of his language, and with no means  of intelligence between us save signs, was a genius as regards ability to  teach language when compared to most Gipsies.    Everybody has heard of the Oriental _salaam_!  In English Gipsy _shulam_  means a greeting.  \"Shulam to your kokero!\" is another form of  _sarishan_! the common form of salutation.  The Hindu _sar i sham_  signifies \"early in the evening,\" from which I infer that the Dom or Rom  was a nocturnal character like the Night-Cavalier of Quevedo, and who  sang when night fell, \"Arouse ye, then, my merry men!\" or who said \"Good-  evening!\" just as we say (or used to say) \"Good-day!\" {127}    A very curious point of affinity between the Gipsies and Hindus may be  found in a custom which was described to me by a Rom in the following  words:--    \"When a mush mullers, an' the juvas adree his ker can't _kair habben_  because they feel so naflo 'bout the rom being gone, or the chavi or  juvalo mush, or whoever it may be, then their friends for trin divvuses  kairs their habben an' bitchers it a lende.  An' that's tacho Rommanis,  an' they wouldn't be dessen Rommany chuls that wouldn't kair dovo for  mushis in sig an' tukli.\"    \"When a man dies, and the women in his house cannot prepare food  (literally, make food) as they feel so badly because the man is gone (or  the girl, or young man, or whoever it may be), then their friends for  three days prepare their food and send it to them.  And that is real  Rommany (custom), and they would not be decent Rommany fellows who would  not do that for people in sorrow and distress.\"    Precisely the same custom prevails in India, where it is characterised by  a phrase strikingly identical with the English Gipsy term for it.  In  England it is to _kair habben_, in Hindustani (Brice, Hin. Dict.)  \"karwa  khana is the food that is sent for three days from relations to a family  in which one of the members has died.\"  The Hindu karwana, to make or to  cause to do, and kara, to do, are the origin of the English Gipsy _kair_  (to make or cook), while from khana,"]]]
