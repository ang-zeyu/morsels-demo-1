But though  religion may thus give beauty and holiness to common things, yet  inasmuch as it sanctifies what it finds rather than prescribes what  should be, it must bear the blame for foolish and even injurious  customs. Child marriages have nothing to do with the creed of Hinduism,  yet many Hindus, especially Hindu women, would feel it irreligious, as  well as a social disgrace, to let a daughter become adult without being  married.    A comparison of Indian Mohammedans and Hindus suggests that the former  are more warlike and robust, the latter more intellectual and ingenious.  The fact that some Mohammedans belong to hardy tribes of invaders must  be taken into account but Islam deserves the credit of having introduced  a simple and fairly healthy rule of life which does not allow every  caste to make its own observances into a divine law. Yet it would seem  that the medical and sanitary rules of Hinduism deserve less abuse than  they generally receive. Col. King, Sanitary Commissioner of the Madras  Presidency, is quoted as saying in a lecture[84]: \"The Institutes of  Vishnu and the Laws of Manu fit in excellently with the bacteriology,  parasitology and applied hygiene of the West. The hygiene of food and  water, private and public conservancy, disease suppression and  prevention, are all carefully dealt with.\"    Hinduism certainly has proved marvellously stimulating to the intellect  or--shall we put it the other way?--is the product of profound, acute,  and restless minds. It cannot be justly accused of being enervating or  melancholy, for many Hindu states were vigorous and warlike[85] and the  accounts of early travellers indicate that in pre-mohammedan days the  people were humane, civilized and contented. It created an original and  spiritual art, for Indian art, more than any other, is the direct  product of religion and not merely inspired by it. In ages when original  talent is rare this close relation has disadvantages for it tends to  make all art symbolic and conventional. An artist must not represent a  deity in the way that he thinks most effective: the proportions,  attitude and ornaments are all prescribed, not because they suit a  picture or statue but because they mean something.    Indian literature is also directly related to religion. Its extent is  well-nigh immeasurable. I will not alarm the reader with statistics of  the theological and metaphysical treatises which it contains. A little  of such goes a long way even when they are first-rate, but India may at  least boast of having more theological works which, if considered as  intellectual productions, must be placed in the first class than Europe.  Nor are religious writings of a more human type absent--the language of  heart to heart and of the heart to God. The Ramayana of Tulsi Das and  the Tiruvwcagam are extolled by Groase, Grierson and Pope (all of them  Christians, I believe) as not only masterpieces of literature but as  noble expressions of pure devotion, and the poems of Kabir and Tukaram,  if less considerable as literary efforts, show the same spiritual  quality. Indian poetry, even when nominally secular, is perhaps too much  under religious influence to suit our taste and the long didactic and  philosophic harangues which interrupt the action of the Mahabharata seem  to us inartistic, yet to those who take the pains to familiarize  themselves with what at first is strange, the Mahabharata is, I think, a  greater poem than the _Iliad_. It should not be regarded as an epic  distended and interrupted by interpolated sermons but as the scripture  of the warrior caste, which sees in the soldier's life a form of  religion.    I have touched in several places on the defects of Hinduism. They are  due partly to its sanction of customs which have no necessary connection  with it and partly to its extravagance, which in the service of the gods  sees no barriers of morality or humanity. But suttee, human sacrifices  and orgies strike the imagination and assume an importance which they  have not and never had for Hinduism as a whole. If Hinduism were really  bad, so many great thoughts, so many good lives could not have grown up  in its atmosphere. More than any other religion it is a quest of truth  and not a creed, which must necessarily become antiquated: it admits the  possibility of new scriptures, new incarnations, new institutions. It  has no quarrel with knowledge or speculation: perhaps it excludes  materialists, because they have no common ground with religion, but it  tolerates even the Sankhya philosophy which has nothing to say about God  or worship. It is truly dynamic and in the past whenever it has seemed  in danger of withering it has never failed to bud with new life and put  forth new flowers.    More than other religions, Hinduism appeals to the soul's immediate  knowledge and experience of God. It has sacred books innumerable but  they agree in little but this, that the soul can come into contact and  intimacy with its God, whatever name be given him and even if he be  superpersonal. The possibility and truth of this experience is hardly  questioned in India and the task of religion is to bring it about, not  to promote the welfare of tribes and states but to effect the  enlightenment and salvation of souls.    The love of the Hindus for every form of argument and philosophizing is  well known but it is happily counterbalanced by another tendency.  Instinct and religion both bring them into close sympathy with nature.  India is in the main an agricultural country[86] and nearly  three-quarters of the population are villagers whose life is bound up  with the welfare of plants and animals and lies at the mercy of rivers  that overflow or skies that withhold the rain. To such people  nature-myths and sacred animals appeal with a force that Europeans  rarely understand. The parrots that perch on the pinnacles of the temple  and the oxen that rest in the shade of its courts are not intruders but  humble brothers of mankind, who may also be the messengers of the gods.      24. _Buddhism in Practice_    As I said above, it is easier to estimate the effects of Buddhism than  of Hinduism, for its history is the chronicle of a great missionary  enterprise and there are abundant materials for studying the results of  its diffusion.    Even its adversaries must admit that it has many excellent qualities. It  preaches morality and charity and was the first religion to proclaim to  the world--not to a caste or country--that these are the foundation of  that Law which if kept brings happiness. It civilized many nations, for  instance the Tibetans and Mongols. It has practised toleration and true  unworldliness, if not without any exception[87], at least far more  generally than any other great religion. It has directly encouraged art  and literature and, so far as I know, has never opposed the progress of  knowledge. But two charges may be brought against it which deserve  consideration. First that its pessimistic doctrines and monastic  institutions are, if judged by ordinary standards, bad for the welfare  of a nation: second that more than any other religion it is liable to  become corrupt.    In all Buddhist lands, though good laymen are promised the blessings of  religion, the monastic and contemplative life is held up as the ideal.  In Christendom, this ideal is rejected by Protestants and for the Roman  and Oriental Churches it is only one among others. Hence every one's  judgment of Buddhism must in a large measure depend on what he thinks of  this ideal. Monks are not of this world and therefore the world hateth  them. If they keep to themselves, they are called lazy and useless. If  they take part in secular matters, they meet with even severer  criticism. Yet can any one doubt that what is most needed in the present  age is more people who have leisure and ability to think?    Whatever evil is said of Buddhist monks is also said of Mt Athos and  similar Christian establishments. I am far from saying that this  depreciation of the cloistered life is just in either case but any  impartial critic of monastic institutions must admit that their virtues  avoid publicity and their faults attract attention. In all countries a  large percentage of monks are indolent: it is the temptation which  besets all but the elect. Yet the Buddhist ideal of the man who has  renounced the world leaves no place for slackness, nor I think does the  Christian. Buddhist monks are men of higher aspirations than others:  they try to make themselves supermen by cultivating not the forceful and  domineering part of their nature but the gentle, charitable and  intelligent part. The laity treat them with the greatest respect  provided that they set an example of a life better than most men can  live. A monastic system of this kind is found in Burma. I do not mean  that it is not found in other Buddhist lands, but I cite an instance  which I have seen myself and which has impressed most observers  favourably.    The Burmese monks are not far from the ideal of Gotama, yet perhaps by  adhering somewhat strictly to the letter of his law they have lost  something of the freedom which he contemplated. In his time there were  no books: the mind found exercise and knowledge in conversation. A  monastery was not a permanent residence, except during the rainy season,  but merely a halting-place for the brethren who were habitually  wanderers, continually hearing and seeing something new. Hermits and  solitary dwellers in the forests were not unknown but assuredly the  majority of the brethren had no intention of secluding themselves from  the intellectual life of the age. What would Gotama have done had he  lived some hundreds or thousands of years later? I see no reason to  doubt that he would have encouraged the study of literature and science.  He would probably have praised all art which expresses noble and  spiritual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15262"],[0,"Christianity and Islam in Spain, A.D. 756-1031 (#19)"],[1," Makkari, ii.      162), and Akbar ibn Abdallah.

Very little is      known of this Egila, nor is it certain of what see he was the      bishop.        [4] See below, p. 131 ad fin. and 166 ff.    But the other class of councils, partly ecclesiastical and partly  political, seem to have been commoner, and we have already seen how  Reccafredus, Bishop of Seville, in conjunction with the Moslem  authorities, held such a council, in order to coerce the fanatical party  among the Christians; and we have a more particular account of another,  which was held by Hostegesis, Bishop of Malaga, and Servandus, Count of  Cordova.[1] This council seems to have had some connection with the  preceding one under Reccafredus, for Servandus was a strong and  unscrupulous opponent of the party led by Eulogius, while Samson was  their devoted supporter, though he did not carry his opinions so far as  to suffer martyrdom in his own person. Samson was now accused of  heresy[2] and sacrilege, as has been already mentioned. Hostegesis  forced his views on the assembled bishops by the help of the secular  arm, and a sentence of anathema and deposition was accordingly  pronounced against the unfortunate Abbot.[3] One of the apparently  consenting bishops was Valentius, Bishop of Cordova, but his judgement  had evidently been coerced, for after the close of the council he  sounded the other consenting bishops, and some who had not attended, as  to their opinions, and found that most of them were ready to affirm  Samson's orthodoxy, and a memorial was drawn up to that effect This  action of Valentius' brought upon him also a sentence of deposition, and  he was succeeded by Stephanus Flaccus,[4]--the election of the latter  being quite informal, as no metropolitan assisted thereat,[5] and  neither the clergy nor laymen of his diocese made a petition in his  favour.

This fresh deposition was formally sanctioned by a new council, held at  the church of St Acislus; Flaccus, and some of those who had sided with  Valentius, but were now terrified into submission, being in attendance;  while the places of those who refused to come were taken by Jews and  Moslems.[1] These high-handed proceedings nearly led to an open rupture  in the Church.[2]    In 914 a council is said to have been held (but on doubtful authority)  by Orontius of Toledo,[3] and twenty years later by Basilius of Cordova.  These would fall under the reign of the greatest of the Umeyyade Khalifs  of Spain.[4]        [1] Sayones (?) in the Latin. Samson, chap. iii.        [2] _Ibid._, sec. 10.

Abdurrahman III., Annasir Lidinillah (912-961), may be looked upon as  the Solomon of the Spanish Sultans. Succeeding to the throne when quite  a youth, to the exclusion of his uncles, the sons of the late Sultan, he  found the country torn by innumerable factions, and the king's power  openly defied by rebels, Arab, Berber, and Christian. In person, and  through his generals, he put down all these rebels, and though not  uniformly successful against the Christians in the North, yet he  defeated them in a series of great engagements.[1] He welded all the  discordant elements under his rule into one great whole,[2] thereby  giving the Arab domination in Spain another lease of life. In 929 he  took the title of Amir al Mumenin, or Commander of the Faithful. His  alliance was sought by the Emperor of the East,[3] and he treated on  equal terms with the Emperor of Germany and the King of France. To this  great king, with more truth than to his namesake Abdurrahman II., may be  applied the words of Miss Yonge:--[4]    \"He was of that type of Eastern monarch, that seems moulded on the  character of Solomon--large-hearted, wise, magnificent, tolerant, and  peaceful. He was as great a contrast to the stern, ascetic,  narrow-minded, but earnest Alfonso or Ramiro, as were the exquisite  horse-shoe arches, filagree stonework lattices, inlaid jewellery of  marble pavements, and slender minarets, to their dark vault-like,  low-browed churches, and solid castles built out of hard unmanageable  granite.\"        [1] Mutonia (918); Calaborra; Vale de Junqueras (921).        [2] Dozy, ii. 351, from an Arab writer.        [3] A very interesting account of this embassy from Constantine      VII. (947) is given in Al Makkari, ii. 137, from Ibn      Khaldun.---See Conde, i. 442.        [4] P. 57.    We find in this king none of that suspicious jealousy which we saw in  Mohammed, even though Omar, the arch rebel, and Christian renegade,  still held out at Bobastro, when he ascended the throne; and his  treatment of Christians was, throughout his reign, tolerant and politic.    But his claims in this respect will be best seen from a very interesting  fragment that has come down to our own times, describing the embassy of  a certain John of Gorz, a monk from an abbey near Metz, who carried  letters from Otho, emperor of Germany, to the Spanish Sultan.[1]    In 950 Abdurrahman had sent an embassy to the emperor. A bishop who had  been at the head of this embassy died, and this seems to have caused a  delay in the answer. As the Khalif's letter contained blasphemies  against Christ, it was determined to write a reply in the king's name,  such as might perhaps convince Abdurrahman of the error of his ways. A  certain bishop, Adalbero, was appointed to be at the head of the return  embassy,[2] and he asks the abbot of the monastery of Gorz to give him  two assistants. Two are chosen, but one of these quarrels with his  superior, and is expelled from the body; whereupon John offers himself  as a substitute. The abbot only gives his consent to John's going with  great reluctance, knowing that the young monk had an ardent longing to  be a martyr, if he could only get the opportunity.        [1] See \"Vita Johannis Abbatis Gorziensis,\" 973, by John, Abbot      of Arnulph. \"Migne,\" vol. cxxxvii., pp. 239-310.        [2] In 953.    Going through Lyons, and by ship to Barcelona, the ambassadors reached  the frontier town, Tortosa, and at last got to Cordova, where they were  assigned a house two miles from the palace, and, though well  entertained, were informed, to their dismay, that, as the Moorish  ambassadors had been made to wait three years for an answer, Otho's  messengers would have to wait nine years. Moreover, they now discovered  that the king had been already apprised of the contents of the letter,  which Otho had sent, by a comrade of the late ambassador-bishop, whom  John and his companions had taken with them to Barcelona.    The king employs Hasdai, a Jew, as his go-between; who warns them not to  divulge the contents of the letter, as it would make them liable to  punishment; for the letter contained what Moslems would consider  blasphemy against their Prophet. Soon after this John, the Bishop of  Cordova, is sent to them to suggest that they should carry their gifts  to the king, and say nothing of the letter. But John of Gorz stoutly  refused to do this, saying that the delivery of the letter was his chief  duty, and that as Abdurrahman had begun by reviling Christ, he must not  be surprised at Otho's retaliating against Mohammed. However, John of  Cordova begs him to remember the position in which the Christians stood,  viz., under Pagan rule. \"We are forbidden,\" he said, \"by the apostle to  resist the powers that be. In our calamity, we have this one  consolation, we are allowed to observe our own laws and rites, and our  rulers, if they see us diligent in our religion, honour us, cherish us,  and delight in our society, while they abhor the Jews. As our religion,  then, suffers no harm at their hands, let us obey the Moslems in other  things.\" The bishop was anxious, therefore, that the letter should be  suppressed, as calculated to do harm to the Christian community, and no  good to Otho. His advice, however, fell on deaf ears. The monk of Gorz  was resolved on doing what he deemed his plain duty; nor was he content  to forego his chance of martyrdom, though his action might entail  disastrous consequences on the Christians subject to the Moors. He  taunted the bishop with giving his advice from a fear of man. \"Better  die of hunger than eat the salt of unbelievers;\" and expressed horror at  the fact that the bishop was circumcised, and also abstained from  certain meats in deference to Moslem scruples. It was in vain that the  bishop pointed out that otherwise they could not live with the Saracens.    John of Gorz now expressed his intention of delivering the letter  forthwith; but the king denied the ambassadors an audience, leaving them  to themselves for six or seven weeks. Early in 955, however, the king  sent to them, and asked if they held firm to their previous resolve, and  on receiving an answer in the affirmative, he threatened all the  Christians in his dominions with loss of privileges and even death. John  of Gorz merely answers that the guilt would be on the king's head; but  the latter is persuaded to milder counsels by his advisers, who remind  him of Otho's power, and the certainty that "]]]
