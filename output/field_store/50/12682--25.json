Anthony, on the Charge of (#19)"],[1,"k, or any State, in respect of voting, he may be punished by the  United States. And the offense is a variable quantity; what is a crime  in one State under this Act, is a legal right and duty in another. A  citizen of Rhode Island, for instance, who votes when not possessed in  his own right, of an estate in fee simple--in fee tail, for life, or in  reversion or remainder, of the value of $134 or up-wards, may be  convicted of a crime under this Act, and imprisoned in a State Prison.  He voted in violation of the laws of his State. A citizen of New York  votes under precisely similar circumstances, and with the same  qualifications, and his act is a legal one, and he performs a simple  duty. Any State may, by its Constitution and laws, permit women to vote.  Had these defendants been acting as Inspectors of Elections in such  State, their act would be no crime, and this indictment could not be  sustained, for the only illegality alleged is, that the citizens whose  votes were received were women, and therefore not entitled to vote.    The Act of Congress thus, is simply an Act to enforce the diverse penal  statutes of the various States in relation to voting. In order to make a  case, the United States must combine the federal law with the statutes  of the State where the _venue_ of the prosecution is laid.    Before the enactment of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, it is not,  and never was pretended, that Congress possessed any such power.  Subdivision 1 of Section 2, of Article one of the Constitution, provides  as follows:         \"The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen       every second year by the people of the several States; and the       electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for       electors of the most numerous branch of the State Legislature.\"    By this provision, what shall qualify a person to be an elector, is left  entirely to the States. Whoever, in any State, is permitted to vote for  members of the most numerous branch of its legislature, is also  competent to vote for Representatives in Congress. The State might  require a property qualification, or it might dispense with it. It might  permit negroes to vote, or it might exclude them. It might permit women  to vote, or even foreigners, and the federal constitution would not be  infringed. If a State had provided a different qualification for an  elector of Representatives in Congress, from that required of an elector  of the most numerous branch of its Legislature, the power of the federal  constitution might be invoked, and the law annuled. But never was the  idea entertained, that this provision of the Constitution authorizes  Congress to pass laws for the punishment of individuals in the States  for illegal voting, or State returning officers for receiving illegal  votes.    This power, if it exist, must be found in the recent Amendments to the  U.S. Constitution.    I assume that your Honor will hold, as you did yesterday in Miss  Anthony's case, that these amendments do not confer the right to vote  upon citizens of the United States, and therefore not upon women. That  decision is the law of this case. It follows necessarily from that  decision, that these amendments have nothing to do with the right of  voting, except so far as that right \"_is denied or abridged by the  United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous  condition of servitude_.\"    The thirteenth article of the Amendments to the Constitution of the  United States, in Section 1, ordains that \"_neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the  party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United  States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction_.\"    Section 2, ordains that \"_Congress shall have power to enforce this  Article by appropriate legislation_.\"    The fourteenth article of the Amendments to the Constitution of the  United States, ordains in Section 1, \"_All persons born or naturalized  in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are  citizens of the United States, and of the State where they reside. No  State shall make or enforce any law, which shall abridge the privileges  or immunities of citizens of the United States. Nor shall any State  deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of  law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction, the equal  protection of the laws._\"    Section five enacts, \"_The Congress shall have power to enforce by  appropriate legislation, the provisions of this Article._\"    The fifteenth article of Amendment to the Constitution ordains in its  first section, that \"That the right of citizens of the United States to  vote, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any  State, on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\"    Section two enacts, that \"_The Congress shall have power to enforce this  Article by appropriate legislation._\"    These are the provisions of the Constitution relied on to support the  legislation of Congress now before this Court. Some features of that  legislation may be constitutional and valid. Whether this be so or not,  it is not necessary now to determine. The question here is, has  Congress, by either of these amendments, been clothed with the power, to  pass laws to punish inspectors of elections in this State for receiving  the votes of women?    The thirteenth amendment simply abolishes slavery, and authorizes such  legislation as shall be necessary to make that enactment effectual.    The power in question is not found there.    The fourteenth amendment defines who are citizens of the United States,  and prohibits the States from making or enforcing \"_any law which shall  abridge the privileges or immunities_\" of such citizens.    Either the right to vote is one of the \"_privileges or immunities_\" of  the United States citizen, which the states are forbidden to abridge, or  it is not. If it is, then the women whose votes these defendants  received, being citizens of the United States, and in every other way  qualified to vote, possessed the right to vote, and their votes were  rightfully received. If it is not, then the fourteenth amendment confers  no power upon Congress, to legislate, on the subject of voting in the  States. There is no other clause or provision of that amendment which  can by any possibility confer such power--a power which cannot be  implied, but which, if it exist, must be expressly given in some part of  the Constitution, or clearly needed to carry into effect some power that  is expressly given.    No such power is conferred by the fifteenth amendment. That amendment  operates upon the States and upon the United States, and not upon the  citizen. \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote, shall not  be denied or abridged by 'THE UNITED STATES OR BY ANY STATE.'\" The terms  \"_United States_\" and \"State,\" as here used, mean the government of the  United States and of the States. They do not apply to individuals or to  offenses committed by individuals, but only to acts done by the State or  the United States.    But at any rate, the operation of this amendment, and the power given to  Congress to enforce it, is limited to offenses committed in respect of  depriving persons of the right to vote because of their \"_race, color,  or previous condition of servitude_.\"    This is not such a case. There is no ground for saying that these  defendants have committed any offense against the spirit or the letter  of the fifteenth amendment, or any legitimate legislation for its  enforcement.    Congress cannot make laws to regulate the duties of Inspectors, and it  cannot inflict a penalty.      Second.    _No offense is stated in the indictment._    The first count in the indictment is for knowingly and wilfully  registering as a voter, Susan B. Anthony. This count is under Section 26  of the Act of May 31, 1870, as amended by the Act of February 28, 1871.    The indictment contains no averment that the defendants were \"_officers  of registration_,\" and charged with the duty of making a correct  registry of voters. It simply alleges that they were _Inspectors of  Elections_. What that means, the indictment does not inform us. It is  not an office defined by the Acts of Congress upon which this indictment  was found, nor has the Court any information of which it can take notice  as to what are the duties of such officers. In the absence of any claim  in the indictment to that effect, the Court will not presume the  existence of so important a circumstance against the defendants, and  therefore this count of the indictment must fail.    2. The second count is for the same offense, and obnoxious to the same  objection. The only variation being that the first count charges the  illegal registry of one woman, and the second, fourteen.    3. The third count charges that the defendants, being inspectors of  elections, received the votes of fourteen women who had no right to  vote, wrongfully.    This count does not allege that it was the duty of the defendants to  receive or count the votes. It simply alleges that they were Inspectors  of Election. Their duties as such are not stated. It is not alleged that  as such inspectors they were charged with the duty of receiving and  counting votes. It is not claimed by the indictment that these votes  were counted or put into the ballot box--or affected the result. The  defendants simply received the votes. What they did with them, does not  appear. Any bystander, who had received these votes, could be convicted  under this indictment as well as they.    WILLIAM F. MORRISON, a witness called in behalf of the United States,  testified as follows:    _Examined_ by Mr. Crowley:    Q. Where did you live, in November, 1872?    A. City of Rochester.    Q.

In  London her musical gifts proved to include a phenomenal soprano voice,  which developed a compass from G to E altissimo, unrivalled portamento  di voce, pure enunciation and precise intonation. She became skilled in  harmony, theory, sight-reading and harpsichord playing. When she sang,  her glowing countenance, her supreme acting and the lights and shades of  her voice made people forget the plainness of her features and the  insignificance of her form and stature. Her rendering of Handel's airs,  especially \"I Know that My Redeemer Liveth,\" was pronounced faultless.    Frederick the Great, who as soon expected pleasure from the neighing of  a horse as from a German songstress, vanquished on hearing her,  retained her as court singer. While in his service she became the wife  of Jean Mara, a handsome, dissipated court violoncellist, whom she loved  devotedly, but who led her a sorry life. Returning to London later she  taught singing at two guineas a lesson. Upon fear being expressed that  her price, double that of other teachers, would limit her class, she  said her pupils having her voice as a model could learn in half the time  required for those who had only the tinkling of a piano to imitate.  Though she believed singing should be taught by a singer, a tenderness  for her own experience made her insist that the best way to begin the  musical education was by having the pupil learn to play the violin. When  she heard a songstress extolled for rapid vocalization she would ask:  \"Can she sing six plain notes?\" This question might afford young singers  food for reflection. Madame Mara passed her declining years teaching  singing near her native place, and died at Reval, in 1833. Two years  earlier, on her eighty-third birthday, Goethe offered her a poetic  tribute.    At a London farewell concert given by Madame Mara in 1802, she was  assisted by Mrs. Elizabeth Billington, who has been ranked first among  English-born queens of song. Her pure soprano had a range of three  octaves, from A to A, with flute-like upper tones. She sang with  neatness, agility and precision, could detect the least false intonation  of instrument or voice, and was attractive in appearance. Haydn  eulogized her genius in his diary, and in the studio of Sir Joshua  Reynolds, who was painting her portrait as St. Cecilia, exclaimed: \"You  have represented Mrs. Billington listening to the angels, you should  have made them listening to her.\" It was she who introduced Mozart's  operas into England. She only lived to be forty-eight, breaking down in  1818, from the effects of brutal treatment of her second husband, a  Frenchman, named Felissent.    Last of the eighteenth century queens of song was Angelica Catalani,  born some forty miles from Rome in 1779, destined by her father, a  local magistrate, for the cloister, and borne beyond its walls by her  magnificent voice, with its compass of three octaves, from G to G. She  is described as a tall, fair woman with a splendid presence, large blue  eyes, features of perfect symmetry and a winning smile. So great was her  natural facility she could rise with ease from the faintest sound to the  most superb crescendo, could send her tones sweeping through the air  with the most delicious undulations, imitating the swell and fall of a  bell, and could trill like a bird on each note of a chromatic passage.  She dazzled her listeners, but left the heart untouched.    Her domestic life was a happy one, and her husband, Captain de  Vallebregue, adored her, although he knew so little about music that  once when she complained that the piano was too high he had six inches  cut off its legs. Surrounded by adulation at home and abroad, her  self-conceit became inordinate, tempting her to the most absurd feats of  skill. Her excessive love of display and lack of artistic judgment and  knowledge finally led her so far astray in pitch that she lost all  prestige. After seventeen years of retirement, she died of cholera in  1849, in Paris. A few days before she was stricken with the dire  epidemic Jenny Lind sought and received her blessing.    A queen of song who profoundly impressed her age was Giuditta Pasta,  born near Milan in 1798, of Hebrew parentage. For her Bellini wrote \"La  Sonnambula\" and \"Norma,\" Donizetti his \"Anna Bolena,\" Pacini his  \"Niobe,\" and she was the star of Rossini's leading operas of the time.  Her voice, a mezzo-soprano, at first unequal, weak, of slender range and  lacking flexibility, acquired, through her wonderful genius and industry  a range of two octaves and a half, reaching D in altissimo, together  with a sweetness, a fluency, and a chaste, expressive style. Although  below medium height, in impassioned moments she seemed to rise to  queenly stature. Both acting and singing were governed by ripe judgment,  profound sensibility and noble simplicity. She died at Lake Como in  1865.    So many queens of song have reigned from the beginning of the  nineteenth century to the present time that only a few brilliant names  may here be mentioned. Among these Henrietta Sontag was the greatest  German singer of the first half of the century. A distinguished traveler  tells of having found her when she was eight years old, in 1812, sitting  on a table, where her mother had placed her, and singing the grand aria  of the Queen of the Night from the \"Magic Flute,\" her voice, \"pure,  penetrating and of angelic tone,\" flowing as \"unconsciously as a limpid  rill from the mountain side.\" At fifteen she made her regular debut, and  we are told that she sang \"with the volubility of a bird.\" During her  four years at the Conservatory of Prague she had won the prize in every  class of vocal music, piano and harmony.    Acquitting herself with ease in both German and Italian, and being  exceedingly versatile, she won equal renown in the operas of Weber,  Mozart, Rossini, and Donizetti. Paris, in special, marveled at the  little German who could give satisfaction in Grand Opera. Her voice, a  pure soprano, reached to D in alt., with upper notes like silvery  bell-tones, and its natural pliability was cultivated by taste and  incessant study. She was of medium stature, elegant form, with light  hair, fair complexion and soft, expressive blue eyes that lent an  enchantment to features that were not otherwise striking. In demeanor  she was artless, unaffected and ladylike. Romantic stories were  continually in circulation regarding suitors for her hand. As the wife  of Count Rossi, an attache of the Sardinian legation, she retired to  private life in 1830, and passed many happy years with her husband in  various capitols of Europe. When, in 1848, owing to financial shipwreck,  she returned to the stage her voice still charmed by its exquisite  purity, spirituelle quality and supreme finish. In 1852 she came to  America and created an immense furore in the musical and fashionable  world. She died of cholera in Mexico in 1854.    Born the same year as Madame Sontag was Wilhelmine Schroeder-Devrient,  one of the world's noblest interpreters of German opera and German  Lieder, although surpassed by others in vocal resources. She grew up on  the stage, and was trained by her father, Friedrich Schroeder, a baritone  singer, and her mother, Sophie Schroeder, known as the \"Siddons of  Germany.\" Her dramatic soprano was capable of producing the most tender,  powerful, truthful and intensely thrilling effects, although it was not  specially tractable and was at times even harsh. It was she who by her  magnificent interpretation of Leonore, in Beethoven's \"Fidelio,\" first  revealed the beauty of the part to the public. In Wagner's operas she  appeared as Senta, in the \"Flying Dutchman\"; Venus, in \"Tannhaeuser,\" and  actually created the role of Adriano Colonna, in \"Rienzi.\" Goethe, who  had earlier failed to appreciate Schubert's matchless setting to his  \"Erl King,\" when he heard Madame Schroeder-Devrient sing it, exclaimed:  \"Had music instead of words been my vehicle of thought, it is thus I  should have framed the legend.\" She died in 1860.    Full of caprice, radiating the fire of genius, wayward and playful as a  child, Maria Felicita Malibran swept like a dazzling meteor across the  musical firmament. M. Arthur Pougin thus epitomizes her story:    \"Daughter of a Spaniard, born in France, married in America, died in  England, buried in Belgium. Comedienne at five, married at seventeen,  dead at twenty-eight--immortal. Beautiful, brilliant, gay as a ray of  sunlight, with frequent shadings of melancholy; heart full of warmth and  abandon; devoted to the point of sacrifice; courageous to temerity;  ardent for pleasure as for work; with a will and energy indomitable. A  singer without a peer, and a lyric tragedienne capable of exciting the  instinctive enthusiasm of the masses and the reasonable admiration of  connoisseurs. Pianist, composer, poet, she drew and painted with taste;  spoke fluently five languages; was expert in all feminine work, skilled  in sport and outdoor exercises, and possessed of a striking originality.  Such was Malibran in part, for the whole could never be expressed.\"    Her genius developed under the iron control of her father, Manuel del  Popolo Garcia, who compelled to submission her seemingly intractable  voice until it became sonorous, superb, a brilliant and fascinating  contralto, with a range of over three octaves, reaching E in alt. Her  own indomitable will and exceptional artistic intelligence were prime  factors in the training. In her heart-searching tones"]]]
