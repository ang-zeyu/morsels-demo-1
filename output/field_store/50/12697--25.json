There is no fear  in their gaze as they look at her beautiful image, for their eyes are  filled with tears of love.          THE TWO JUGGLERS    [Illustration]      One beautiful spring day two men strolled into the public square of  a well-known Chinese city. They were plainly dressed and looked like  ordinary countrymen who had come in to see the sights. Judging by their  faces, they were father and son. The elder, a wrinkled man of perhaps  fifty, wore a scant grey beard. The younger had a small box on his  shoulder.    At the hour when these strangers entered the public square, a large  crowd had gathered, for it was a feast day, and every one was bent on  having a good time. All the people seemed very happy. Some, seated in  little open-air booths, were eating, drinking, and smoking. Others were  buying odds and ends from the street-vendors, tossing coins, and playing  various games of chance.    The two men walked about aimlessly. They seemed to have no friends among  the pleasure-seekers. At last, however, as they stood reading a public  notice posted at the entrance of the town-hall or yamen, a bystander  asked them who they were.    \"Oh, we are jugglers from a distant province,\" said the elder, smiling  and pointing towards the box. \"We can do many tricks for the amusement  of the people.\"    Soon it was spread about among the crowd that two famous jugglers had  just arrived from the capital, and that they were able to perform many  wonderful deeds. Now it happened that the mandarin or mayor of the city,  at that very moment was entertaining a number of guests in the yamen.  They had just finished eating, and the host was wondering what he should  do to amuse his friends, when a servant told him of the jugglers.    \"Ask them what they can do,\" said the mandarin eagerly. \"I will pay them  well if they can really amuse us, but I want something more than the old  tricks of knife-throwing and balancing. They must show us something  new.\"    The servant went outside and spoke to the jugglers: \"The great man bids  you tell him what you can do. If you can amuse his visitors he will  bring them out to the private grand stand, and let you perform before  them and the people who are gathered together.\"    \"Tell your honourable master,\" said the elder, whom we shall call Chang,  \"that, try us as he will, he will not be disappointed. Tell him that we  come from the unknown land of dreams and visions, that we can turn rocks  into mountains, rivers into oceans, mice into elephants, in short, that  there is nothing in magic too difficult for us to do.\"    The official was delighted when he heard the report of his servant.  \"Now we may have a little fun,\" he said to his guests, \"for there are  jugglers outside who will perform their wonderful tricks before us.\"    The guests filed out on to the grand stand at one side of the public  square. The mandarin commanded that a rope should be stretched across  so as to leave an open space in full view of the crowd, where the two  Changs might give their exhibition.    For a time the two strangers entertained the people with some of the  simpler tricks, such as spinning plates in the air, tossing bowls up and  catching them on chopsticks, making flowers grow from empty pots, and  transforming one object into another. At last, however, the mandarin  cried out: \"These tricks are very good of their kind, but how about  those idle boasts of changing rivers into oceans and mice into  elephants? Did you not say that you came from the land of dreams? These  tricks you have done are stale and shopworn. Have you nothing new with  which to regale my guests on this holiday?\"    \"Most certainly, your excellency. But surely you would not have a  labourer do more than his employer requires? Would that not be quite  contrary to the teachings of our fathers? Be assured, sir, anything that  you demand I can do for you. Only say the word.\"    The mandarin laughed outright at this boasting language. \"Take care, my  man! Do not go too far with your promises. There are too many impostors  around for me to believe every stranger. Hark you! no lying, for if you  lie in the presence of my guests, I shall take great pleasure in having  you beaten.\"    \"My words are quite true, your excellency,\" repeated Chang earnestly.  \"What have we to gain by deceit, we who have performed our miracles  before the countless hosts of yonder Western Heaven?\"    \"Ha, ha! hear the braggarts!\" shouted the guests. \"What shall we command  them to do?\"    For a moment they consulted together, whispering and laughing.    \"I have it,\" cried the host finally. \"Our feast was short of fruit,  since this is the off season. Suppose we let this fellow supply us.  Here, fellow, produce us a peach, and be quick about it. We have no time  for fooling.\"    \"What, masters, a peach?\" exclaimed the elder Chang in mock dismay.  \"Surely at this season you do not expect a peach.\"    \"Caught at his own game,\" laughed the guests, and the people began to  hoot derisively.    \"But, father, you promised to do anything he required,\" urged the son.  \"If he asks even a peach, how can you refuse and at the same time save  your face?\"    \"Hear the boy talk,\" mumbled the father, \"and yet, perhaps he's right.  Very well, masters,\" turning to the crowd, \"if it's a peach you want,  why, a peach you shall have, even though I must send into the garden of  the Western Heaven for the fruit.\"    The people became silent and the mandarin's guests forgot to laugh. The  old man, still muttering, opened the box from which he had been taking  the magic bowls, plates, and other articles. \"To think of people wanting  peaches at this season! What is the world coming to?\"    After fumbling in the box for some moments he drew out a skein of golden  thread, fine spun and as light as gossamer. No sooner had he unwound a  portion of this thread than a sudden gust of wind carried it up into the  air above the heads of the onlookers. Faster and faster the old man  paid out the magic coil, higher and higher the free end rose into the  heavens, until, strain his eyes as he would, no one present could see  into what far-region it had vanished.    \"Wonderful, wonderful!\" shouted the people with one voice, \"the old man  is a fairy.\"    For a moment they forgot all about the mandarin, the jugglers, and the  peach, so amazed were they at beholding the flight of the magic thread.    At last the old man seemed satisfied with the distance to which his cord  had sailed, and, with a bow to the spectators, he tied the end to a  large wooden pillar which helped to support the roof of the grand stand.  For a moment the structure trembled and swayed as if it too would be  carried off into the blue ether, the guests turned pale and clutched  their chairs for support, but not even the mandarin dared to speak, so  sure were they now that they were in the presence of fairies.    \"Everything is ready for the journey,\" said old Chang calmly.    \"What! shall you leave us?\" asked the mayor, finding his voice again.    \"I? Oh, no, my old bones are not spry enough for quick climbing. My son  here will bring us the magic peach. He is handsome and active enough to  enter that heavenly garden. Graceful, oh graceful is that peach tree--of  course, you remember the line from the poem--and a graceful man must  pluck the fruit.\"    The mandarin was still more surprised at the juggler's knowledge of a  famous poem from the classics. It made him and his friends all the more  certain that the newcomers were indeed fairies.    The young man at a sign from his father tightened his belt and the bands  about his ankles, and then, with a graceful gesture to the astonished  people, sprang upon the magic string, balanced himself for a moment on  the steep incline, and then ran as nimbly up as a sailor would have  mounted a rope ladder. Higher and higher he climbed till he seemed no  bigger than a lark ascending into the blue sky, and then, like some tiny  speck, far, far away, on the western horizon.    The people gazed in open-mouthed wonder. They were struck dumb and  filled with some nameless fear; they hardly dared to look at the  enchanter who stood calmly in their midst, smoking his long-stemmed  pipe.    The mandarin, ashamed of having laughed at and threatened this man  who was clearly a fairy, did not know what to say. He snapped his long  finger nails and looked at his guests in mute astonishment. The visitors  silently drank their tea, and the crowd of sightseers craned their necks  in a vain effort to catch sight of the vanished fairy. Only one in all  that assembly, a bright-eyed little boy of eight, dared to break the  silence, and he caused a hearty burst of merriment by crying out, \"Oh,  daddy, will the bad young man fly off into the sky and leave his poor  father all alone?\"    The greybeard laughed loudly with the others, and tossed the lad a  copper. \"Ah, the good boy,\" he said smiling, \"he has been well trained  to love his father; no fear of foreign ways spoiling his filial piety.\"    After a few moments of waiting, old Chang laid aside his pipe and fixed  his eyes once more on the western sky. \"It is coming,\" he said quietly.  \"The peach will soon be here.\"    [Illustration: \"HIGHER AND HIGHER HE CLIMBED.\"]    Suddenly he held out his hand as if to catch some falling object, but,  look as they would, the people could see nothing. Swish! thud! it came  like a streak of light, and, lo, there in the magician's fingers was a  peach, the most beautiful specimen the people had ever seen, large and  rosy. \"Straight from the garden of the gods,\" said Chang, handing the  fruit to the mandarin, \"a peach in the Second Moon, and the snow hardly  off the ground.\"    Trembling with excitement, the official took the peach and cut it open.

You mean that Cayley closed the door afterwards--as an  afterthought--and very quietly, so that you couldn't hear?\"    Antony nodded.    \"Yes. That explains why I was surprised afterwards when I went into  the room to find the door open behind me. You know how those doors with  springs on them close?\"    \"The sort which old gentlemen have to keep out draughts?\"    \"Yes. Just at first they hardly move at all, and then very, very  slowly they swing to-- well, that was the way the shadow moved, and  subconsciously I must have associated it with the movement of that sort  of door. By Jove!\" He got up, and dusted his knees. \"Now, Bill, just to  make sure, go in and close the door like that. As an afterthought, you  know; and very quietly, so that I don't hear the click of it.\"    Bill did as he was told, and then put his head out eagerly to hear what  had happened.    \"That was it,\" said Antony, with absolute conviction. \"That was just  what I saw yesterday.\" He came out of the office, and joined Bill in the  little room.    \"And now,\" he said, \"let's try and find out what it was that Mr. Cayley  was doing in here, and why he had to be so very careful that his friend  Mr. Gillingham didn't overhear him.\"          CHAPTER XIII. The Open Window      Anthony's first thought was that Cayley had hidden something; something,  perhaps, which he had found by the body, but that was absurd. In the  time at his disposal, he could have done no more than put it away in a  drawer, where it would be much more open to discovery by Antony than if  he had kept it in his pocket. In any case he would have removed it by  this time, and hidden it in some more secret place. Besides, why in this  case bother about shutting the door?    Bill pulled open a drawer in the chest, and looked inside.    \"Is it any good going through these, do you think?\" he asked.    Antony looked over his shoulder.    \"Why did he keep clothes here at all?\" he asked. \"Did he ever change  down here?\"    \"My dear Tony, he had more clothes than anybody in the world. He just  kept them here in case they might be useful, I expect. When you and I  go from London to the country we carry our clothes about with us. Mark  never did. In his flat in London he had everything all over again which  he has here. It was a hobby with him, collecting clothes. If he'd  had half a dozen houses, they would all have been full of a complete  gentleman's town and country outfit.\"    \"I see.\"    \"Of course, it might be useful sometimes, when he was busy in the  next room, not to have to go upstairs for a handkerchief or a more  comfortable coat.\"    \"I see. Yes.\" He was walking round the room as he answered, and he  lifted the top of the linen basket which stood near the wash basin and  glanced in. \"He seems to have come in here for a collar lately.\"    Bill peered in. There was one collar at the bottom of the basket.    \"Yes. I daresay he would,\" he agreed. \"If he suddenly found that the one  he was wearing was uncomfortable or a little bit dirty, or something. He  was very finicking.\"    Antony leant over and picked it out.    \"It must have been uncomfortable this time,\" he said, after examining it  carefully. \"It couldn't very well be cleaner.\" He dropped it back again.  \"Anyway, he did come in here sometimes?\"    \"Oh, yes, rather.\"    \"Yes, but what did Cayley come in for so secretly?\"    \"What did he want to shut the door for?\" said Bill. \"That's what I don't  understand. You couldn't have seen him, anyhow.\"    \"No. So it follows that I might have heard him. He was going to do  something which he didn't want me to hear.\"    \"By Jove, that's it!\" said Bill eagerly.    \"Yes; but what?\"    Bill frowned hopefully to himself, but no inspiration came.    \"Well, let's have some air, anyway,\" he said at last, exhausted by the  effort, and he went to the window, opened it, and looked out. Then,  struck by an idea, he turned back to Antony and said, \"Do you think  I had better go up to the pond to make sure that they're still at it?  Because--\"    He broke off suddenly at the sight of Antony's face.    \"Oh, idiot, idiot!\" Antony cried. \"Oh, most super-excellent of Watsons!  Oh, you lamb, you blessing! Oh, Gillingham, you incomparable ass!\"    \"What on earth--\"    \"The window, the window!\" cried Antony, pointing to it.    Bill turned back to the window, expecting it to say something. As it  said nothing, he looked at Antony again.    \"He was opening the window!\" cried Antony.    \"Who?\"    \"Cayley, of course.\" Very gravely and slowly he expounded. \"He came in  here in order to open the window. He shut the door so that I shouldn't  hear him open the window. He opened the window. I came in here and found  the window open. I said, 'This window is open. My amazing powers of  analysis tell me that the murderer must have escaped by this window.'  'Oh,' said Cayley, raising his eyebrows. 'Well,' said he, 'I suppose you  must be right.' Said I proudly, 'I am. For the window is open,' I said.  Oh, you incomparable ass!\"    He understood now. It explained so much that had been puzzling him.    He tried to put himself in Cayley's place--Cayley, when Antony had first  discovered him, hammering at the door and crying, \"Let me in!\" Whatever  had happened inside the office, whoever had killed Robert, Cayley knew  all about it, and knew that Mark was not inside, and had not escaped by  the window. But it was necessary to Cayley's plans--to Mark's plans  if they were acting in concert--that he should be thought so to have  escaped. At some time, then, while he was hammering (the key in his  pocket) at the locked door, he must suddenly have remembered--with what  a shock!--that a mistake had been made. A window had not been left open!    Probably it would just have been a horrible doubt at first. Was the  office window open? Surely it was open! Was it?.... Would he have time  now to unlock the door, slip in, open the French windows and slip out  again? No. At any moment the servants might come. It was too risky.  Fatal, if he were discovered. But servants were stupid. He could get  the windows safely open while they were crowding round the body. They  wouldn't notice. He could do it somehow.    And then Antony's sudden appearance! Here was a complication. And Antony  suggesting that they should try the window! Why, the window was just  what he wanted to avoid. No wonder he had seemed dazed at first.    Ah, and here at last was the explanation why they had gone the longest  way round and yet run. It was Cayley's only chance of getting a start  on Antony, of getting to the windows first, of working them open somehow  before Antony caught him up. Even if that were impossible, he must get  there first, just to make sure. Perhaps they were open. He must get away  from Antony and see. And if they were shut, hopelessly shut, then he  must have a moment to himself, a moment in which to think of some other  plan, and avoid the ruin which seemed so suddenly to be threatening.    So he had run. But Antony had kept up with him. They had broken in the  window together, and gone into the office. But Cayley was not done yet.  There was the dressing-room window! But quietly, quietly. Antony mustn't  hear.    And Antony didn't hear. Indeed, he had played up to Cayley splendidly.  Not only had he called attention to the open window, but he had  carefully explained to Cayley why Mark had chosen this particular window  in preference to the office window. And Cayley had agreed that probably  that was the reason. How he must have chuckled to himself! But he was  still a little afraid. Afraid that Antony would examine the shrubbery.  Why? Obviously because there was no trace of anyone having broken  through the shrubbery. No doubt Cayley had provided the necessary traces  since, and had helped the Inspector to find them. Had he even gone as  far as footmarks in Mark's shoes? But the ground was very hard. Perhaps  footmarks were not necessary. Antony smiled as he thought of the big  Cayley trying to squeeze into the dapper little Mark's shoes. Cayley  must have been glad that footmarks were not necessary.    No, the open window was enough; the open window and a broken twig or  two. But quietly, quietly. Antony mustn't hear. And Antony had not  heard.... But he had seen a shadow on the wall.    They were outside on the lawn again now, Bill and Antony, and Bill was  listening open-mouthed to his friend's theory of yesterday's happenings.  It fitted in, it explained things, but it did not get them any further.  It only gave them another mystery to solve.    \"What's that?\" said Antony.    \"Mark. Where's Mark? If he never went into the office at all, then where  is he now?\"    \"I don't say that he never went into the office. In fact, he must have  gone. Elsie heard him.\" He stopped and repeated slowly, \"She heard him,  at least she says she did. But if he was there, he came out again by the  door.\"    \"Well, but where does that lead you?\"    \"Where it led Mark. The passage.\"    \"Do you mean that he's been hiding there all the time?\" Antony was  silent until Bill had repeated his question, and then with an effort he  came out of his thoughts and answered him.    \"I don't know. But look here. Here is a possible explanation. I don't  know if it is the right one--I don't know, Bill; I'm rather frightened.  Frightened of what may have happened, of what may be going to happen.  However, here is an explanation. See if you can find any fault with it.\"    With his legs stretched out and his hands deep in his pockets, he lay  back on the garden-seat, looking up to the blue summer sky above him,  and just as if he saw up there the events of yesterday being enacted  over again, he described them slowly to Bill as they happened.    \"We'll begin at the moment when Mark shoots Robert. Call it an accident;  probably it was. Mark would say it was, "]]]
