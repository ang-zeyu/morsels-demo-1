Nor what befell her little tender, the  \"Intrepid,\" which was left in her neighborhood, \"ready for occupation,\"  just as she was left. No man will ever tell of the nip that proved too  much for her,--of the opening of her seams, and her disappearance  beneath the ice. But here is the hardy Resolute, which, on the 15th of  May, 1854, her brave commander left, as he was ordered, \"ready for  occupation,\"--which the brave Captain Buddington found September 10,  1855, more than a thousand miles from there, and pronounced still \"ready  for occupation\";--and of what can be known of her history from Old  London to New London, from Old England's Thames to New England's Thames,  we will try to tell the story; as it is written in the letters of her  old officers and told by the lips of her new rescuers.    For Arctic work, if ships are to go into every nook and lane of ice that  will yield at all to wind and steam, they must be as nearly  indestructible as man can make them. For Arctic work, therefore, and for  discovery work, ships built of the _teak_ wood of Malabar and Java are  considered most precisely fitted. Ships built of teak are said to be  wholly indestructible by time. To this we owe the fact, which now  becomes part of a strange coincidence, that one of the old Captain  Cook's ships which went round the world with him has been, till within a  few years, a whaling among the American whalers, revisiting, as a  familiar thing, the shores which she was first to discover. The English  admiralty, eager to fit out for Arctic service a ship of the best build  they could find, bought the two teak-built ships Baboo and Ptarmigan in  1850,--sent them to their own dock-yards to be refitted, and the Baboo  became the Assistance,--the Ptarmigan became the Resolute, of their  squadrons of Arctic discovery.    Does the reader know that in the desolation of the Arctic shores the  Ptarmigan is the bird most often found? It is the Arctic grouse or  partridge,[O] and often have the ptarmigans of Melville Island furnished  sport and even dinners to the hungry officers of the \"Resolute,\" wholly  unconscious that she had ever been their god-child, and had thrown off  their name only to take that which she now wears.    Early in May, 1850, just at the time we now know that brave Sir John  Franklin and the remnant of his crew were dying of starvation at the  mouth of Back's River, the \"Resolute\" sailed first for the Arctic seas,  the flag-ship of Commodore Austin, with whose little squadron our own De  Haven and his men had such pleasant intercourse near Beechey Island. In  the course of that expedition she wintered off Cornwallis Island,--and  in autumn of the next year returned to England.    Whenever a squadron or a man or an army returns to England, unless in  the extreme and exceptional case of complete victory over obstacle  invincible, there is always dissatisfaction. This is the English way.  And so there was dissatisfaction when Captain Austin returned with his  ships and men. There was also still a lingering hope that some trace of  Franklin might yet be found, perhaps some of his party. Yet more, there  were two of the searching ships which had entered the Polar seas from  Behring's Straits on the west, the \"Enterprise\" and \"Investigator,\"  which might need relief before they came through or returned. Arctic  search became a passion by this time, and at once a new squadron was  fitted out to take the seas in the spring of 1852. This squadron  consisted of the \"Assistance\" and \"Resolute\" again, which had been  refitted since their return, of the \"Intrepid\" and \"Pioneer,\" two  steamships used as tenders to the \"Assistance\" and \"Resolute\"  respectively, and of the \"North Star,\" which had also been in those  regions, and now went as a storeship to the rest of the squadron. To the  command of the whole Sir Edward Belcher was appointed, an officer who  had served in some of the earlier Arctic expeditions. Officers and men  volunteered in full numbers for the service, and these five vessels  therefore carried out a body of men who brought more experience of the  Northern seas together than any expedition which had ever visited them.    Of these, Captain Henry Kellett had command of the \"Resolute,\" and was  second in seniority to Sir Edward Belcher, who made the \"Assistance\" the  flag-ship. It shows what sort of man he was, to say that for more than  ten years he spent only part of one in England, and was the rest of the  time in an antipodean hemisphere or a hyperborean zone. Before brave Sir  John Franklin sailed, Captain Kellett was in the Pacific. Just as he was  to return home, he was ordered into the Arctic seas to search for Sir  John. Three years successively, in his ship the \"Herald,\" he passed  inside Behring's Straits, and far into the Arctic Ocean. He discovered  \"Herald Island,\" the farthest land known there. He was one of the last  men to see McClure in the \"Investigator\" before she entered the Polar  seas from the northwest. He sent three of his men on board that ship to  meet them all again, as will be seen, in strange surroundings. After  more than seven years of this Pacific and Arctic life, he returned to  England, in May or June, 1851, and in the next winter volunteered to try  the eastern approach to the same Arctic seas in our ship, the  \"Resolute.\" Some of his old officers sailed with him.    We know nothing of Captain Kellett but what his own letters, despatches,  and instructions show, as they are now printed in enormous parliamentary  blue-books, and what the despatches and letters of his officers and of  his commander show. But these papers present the picture of a vigorous,  hearty man, kind to his crew and a great favorite with them, brave in  whatever trial, always considerate, generous to his officers, reposing  confidence in their integrity; a man, in short, of whom the world will  be apt to hear more. His commander, Sir Edward Belcher, tried by the  same standard, appears a brave and ready man, apt to talk of himself,  not very considerate of his inferiors, confident in his own opinion; in  short, a man with whom one would not care to spend three Arctic winters.  With him, as we trace the \"Resolute's\" fortunes, we shall have much to  do. Of Captain Kellett we shall see something all along till the day  when he sadly left her, as bidden by Sir Edward Belcher, \"ready for  occupation.\"    With such a captain, and with sixty-odd men, the \"Resolute\" cast off her  moorings in the gray of the morning on the 21st of April, 1852, to go in  search of Sir John Franklin. The brave Sir John had died two years  before, but no one knew that, nor whispered it. The river steam-tug  \"Monkey\" took her in tow, other steamers took the \"Assistance\" and the  \"North Star\"; the \"Intrepid\" and \"Pioneer\" got up their own steam, and  to the cheers of the little company gathered at Greenhithe to see them  off, they went down the Thames. At the Nore, the steamship \"Desperate\"  took the \"Resolute\" in charge, Sir Edward Belcher made the signal  \"Orkneys\" as the place of rendezvous, and in four days she was there, in  Stromness outer harbor. Here there was a little shifting of provisions  and coal-bags, those of the men who could get on shore squandered their  spending-money, and then, on the 28th of April, she and hers bade good  by to British soil. And, though they have welcomed it again long since,  she has not seen it from then till now.    The \"Desperate\" steamer took her in tow, she sent her own tow-lines to  the \"North Star,\" and for three days in this procession of so wild and  weird a name, they three forged on westward toward Greenland,--a train  which would have startled any old Viking had he fallen in with it, with  a fresh gale blowing all the time and \"a nasty sea.\" On the fourth day  all the tow-lines broke or were cast off however, Neptune and the winds  claimed their own, and the \"Resolute\" tried her own resources. The  towing steamers were sent home in a few days more, and the squadron left  to itself.    We have too much to tell in this short article to be able to dwell on  the details of her visits to the hospitable Danes of Greenland, or of  her passage through the ice of Baffin's Bay. But here is one incident,  which, as the event has proved, is part of a singular coincidence. On  the 6th of July all the squadron, tangled in the ice, joined a fleet of  whalers beset in it, by a temporary opening between the gigantic masses.  Caught at the head of a bight in the ice, with the \"Assistance\" and the  \"Pioneer,\" the \"Resolute\" was, for the emergency, docked there, and, by  the ice closing behind her, was, for a while, detained. Meanwhile the  rest of the fleet, whalers and discovery ships, passed on by a little  lane of water, the American whaler \"McLellan\" leading. This \"McLellan\"  was one of the ships of the spirited New London merchants, Messrs.  Perkins & Smith, another of whose vessels has now found the \"Resolute\"  and befriended her in her need in those seas. The \"McLellan\" was their  pioneer vessel there.    The \"North Star\" of the English squadron followed the \"McLellan.\" A  long train stretched out behind. Whalers and government ships, as they  happened to fall into line,--a long three quarters of a mile. It was  lovely weather, and, though the long lane closed up so that they could  neither go back nor forward,--nobody apprehended injury till it was  announced on the morning of the 7th that the poor \"McLellan\" was nipped  in the ice and her crew were deserting her. Sir Edward Belcher was then  in condition to befriend her, sent his carpenters to examine her,--put a  few charges of powder into the ice to relieve the pressure upon  her,--and by the end of the day it was agreed that her injuries could be  repaired, and her crew went on board again. But there is no saying what  ice will do next.

As a  proof of this I shall only observe, that the longitude of the two ports, as  pointed out by the watch and by the observations, did not differ two miles.  This also shews what degree of accuracy these observations are capable of,  when multiplied to a considerable number, made with different instruments,  and with the sun and stars, or both sides of the moon. By this last method,  the errors which may be either in the instruments or lunar tables, destroy  one another, and likewise those which may arise from the observer himself;  for some men may observe closer than others. If we consider the number of  observations that may be obtained in the course of a month (if the weather  is favourable,) we shall perhaps find this method of finding the longitude  of places as accurate as most others; at least it is the most easy, and  attended with the least expence to the observer. Every ship that goes to  foreign parts is, or maybe, supplied with a sufficient number of quadrants  at a small expence; I mean good ones, proper for making these observations.  For the difference of the price between a good and a bad one, I apprehend,  can never be an object with an officer. The most expensive article, and  what is in some measure necessary in order to arrive at the utmost  accuracy, is a good watch; but for common use, and where that strict  accuracy is not required, this may be dispensed with. I have observed  before, in this journal, that this method of finding the longitude is not  so difficult but that any man, with proper application, and a little  practice, may soon learn to make these observations as well as the  astronomers themselves. I have seldom known any material difference between  the observations made by Mr Wales, and those made by the officers at the  same time*.    [See Vol I. p40. \"Which is nearly the same difference as the day  before...\"]    In observing the variation of the magnetic needle, we found, as usual, our  compasses differ among themselves, sometimes near 2 deg.; the same compass too,  would sometimes make nearly this difference in the variation on different  days, and even between the morning and evening of the same day, when our  change of situation has been but very little. By the mean of the  observations which I made about Erromango; and the S.E. part of these  islands, the variation of the compass was 10 deg. 5' 48\" E.; and the mean of  those made about Tierra del Espiritu Santo, gave 10 deg. 5' 30\" E. This is  considerably more than Mr Wales found it to be at Tanna. I cannot say what  might occasion this difference in the variation observed at sea and on  shore, unless it be influenced by the land; for I must give the preference  to that found at sea, as it is agreeable to what we observed before we made  the islands, and after we left them.    CHAPTER VIII.    _An Account of the Discovery of New Caledonia, and the Incidents that  happened while the Ship lay in Balade._    1774 September    At sun-rise on the 1st of September, after having stood to S.W. all night,  no more land was to be seen. The wind remaining in the S.E. quarter, we  continued to stand to S.W. On the 2d, at five o'clock, p.m., being in the  latitude 18 deg. 22', longitude 165 deg. 26', the variation was 10 deg. 50' E.; and at  the same hour on the 3d, it was 10 deg. 51', latitude at that time 19 deg. 14',  longitude 165 deg. E. The next morning, in the latitude of 19 deg. 49' longitude  164 deg. 53\", the amplitude gave 10 deg. 21', and the azimuths 10 deg. 7' E. At eight  o'clock, as we were steering to the south, land was discovered bearing  S.S.W., and at noon it extended from S.S.E. to W. by S., distant about six  leagues. We continued to steer for it with a light breeze at east, till  five in the evening, when we were stopped by a calm. At this time we were  three leagues from the land, which extended from S.E. by S. to W. by N.,  round by the S.W. Some openings appeared in the west, so that we could not  tell whether it was one connected land or a group of islands. To the S.E.  the coast seemed to terminate in a high promontory, which I named Cape  Colnett, after one of my midshipmen who first discovered this land.  Breakers were seen about half-way between us and the shore; and, behind  them, two or three canoes under sail, standing out to sea, as if their  design had been to come off to us; but a little before sun-set they struck  their sails, and we saw them no more. After a few hours calm, we got a  breeze at S.E., and spent the night standing off and on.    On the 5th, at sun-rise, the horizon being clear, we could see the coast  extend to the S.E. of Cape Colnett, and round by the S.W. to N.W. by W.  Some gaps or openings were yet to be seen to the west; and a reef, or  breakers, seemed to lie all along the coast, connected with those we  discovered the preceding night. It was a matter of indifference to me,  whether we plied up the coast to the S.E., or bore down to N.W. I chose the  latter; and after running two leagues down the outside of the reef (for  such it proved) we came before an opening that had the appearance of a good  channel, through which we might go in for the land. I wanted to get at it,  not only to visit it, but also to have an opportunity to observe an eclipse  of the sun which was soon to happen. With this view we brought-to, hoisted  out two armed boats, and sent them to sound the channel; ten or twelve  large sailing canoes being then near us. We had observed them coming off  from the shore, all the morning, from different parts; and some were lying  on the reef, fishing, as we supposed. As soon as they all got together,  they came down to us in a body, and were pretty near when we were hoisting  out our boats, which probably gave them some alarm; for, without stopping,  they hauled in for the reef, and our boats followed them. We now saw that  what we had taken for openings in the coast was low land, and that it was  all connected, except the western extremity, which was an island known by  the name of Balabea, as we afterwards learnt.    The boats having made a signal for a channel, and one of them being placed  on the point of the reef on the weather side of it, we stood in with the  ship, and took up the other boat in our way, when the officer informed me,  that where we were to pass, was sixteen and fourteen fathoms water, a fine  sandy bottom, and that having put alongside two canoes, he found the people  very obliging and civil. They gave him some fish; and, in return, he  presented them with medals, etc. In one was a stout robust young man, whom,  they understood to be a chief. After getting within the reef, we hauled up  S. 1/2 E., for a small low sandy isle that we observed lying under the  shore, being followed by all the canoes. Our sounding in standing in, was  from fifteen to twelve fathoms (a pretty even fine sandy bottom,) for about  two miles; then we had six, five, and four fathoms. This was on the tail of  a shoal which lies a little without the small isle to the N.E. Being over  it, we found seven and eight fathoms water, which shallowed gradually as we  approached the shore, to three fathoms, when we tacked and stood off a  little, and then anchored in five fathoms, the bottom a fine sand mixed  with mud. The little sandy isle bore E. by S., three-quarters of a mile  distant; and we were one mile from the shore of the main, which extended  from S.E. by E., round to the south, to W.N.W. The island of Balabea bore  N.W. by N., and the channel, through which we came, north, four miles  distant. In this situation we were extremely well sheltered from the  reigning winds, by the sandy isle and its shoals, and by the shoal without  them.    We had hardly got to an anchor, before we were surrounded by a great number  of the natives, in sixteen or eighteen canoes, the most of whom were  without any sort of weapons. At first they were shy in coming near the  ship; but in a short time we prevailed on the people in one boat to get  close enough to receive some presents. These we lowered down to them by a  rope, to which, in return, they tied two fish that stunk intolerably, as  did those they gave us in the morning. These mutual exchanges bringing on a  kind of confidence, two ventured on board the ship; and presently after,  she was filled with them, and we had the company of several at dinner in  the cabin. Our pease-soup, salt-beef and pork, they had no curiosity to  taste; but they eat of some yams, which we happened to have yet left,  calling them _Oobee_. This name is not unlike _Oofee_, as they  are called at most of the islands, except Mallicollo; nevertheless, we  found these people spoke a language new to us. Like all the nations we had  lately seen, the men were almost naked; having hardly any other covering  but such a wrapper as is used at Mallicollo*. They were curious in examining  every part of the ship, which they viewed with uncommon attention. They had  not the least knowledge of goats, hogs, dogs, or cats, and had not even a  name for one of them. They seemed fond of large spike-nails, and pieces of  red cloth, or indeed of any other colour, but red was their favourite.    [* The"]]]
