Because of the time and labor involved maybe you had better buy your  cheese cakes, even though some of the truly fine ones cost a dime a  bite, especially the pedigreed Jewish-American ones in Manhattan.  Reuben's and Lindy's are two leaders at about five dollars a cake.  Some are fruited with cherries or strawberries.       Cheese Custard    4 eggs, slightly beaten  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 cup milk  A dash of pepper or paprika  3 tablespoons melted butter  A few drops of onion juice, if desired  4 tablespoons grated Swiss (imported)         Mix all together, set in molds in pan of hot water, and bake       until brown.       Open-faced Cheese Pie    3 eggs  1 cup sugar  2 pounds soft smearcase         Whip everything together and fill two pie crusts. Bake without       any upper crust.      The Apple-pie Affinity    Hot apple pie was always accompanied with cheese in New England, even  as every slice of apple pie in Wisconsin has cheese for a sidekick,  according to law. Pioneer hot pies were baked in brick ovens and  flavored with nutmeg, cinnamon and rose geranium. The cheese was  Cheddar, but today all sorts of pie and cheese combinations are  common, such as banana pie and Gorgonzola, mince with Danish Blue,  pumpkin with cream cheese, peach pie with Hable, and even a green  dusting of Sapsago over raisin pie.    Apple pie _au gratin_, thickly grated over with Parmesan, Caciocavallo  or Sapsago, is something special when served with black coffee. Cider,  too, or applejack, is a natural accompaniment to any dessert of apple  with its cheese.       Apple Pie Adorned         Apple pie is adorned with cream and cheese by pressing cream       cheese through a ricer and folding in plenty of double cream       beaten thick and salted a little. Put the mixture in a pastry       tube and decorate top of pie in fanciful fashion.       Apple Pie a la Cheese         Lay a slice of melting cheese on top of apple (or any fruit or       berry) pie, and melt under broiler 2 to 3 minutes.       Cheese-crusty Apple Pie         In making an apple pie, roll out the top crust and sprinkle with       sharp Cheddar, grated, dot with butter and bake golden-brown.       Flan au Fromage         To make this Franche-Comte tart of crisp paste, simply mix       coarsely grated Gruyere with beaten egg, fill the tart cases and       bake.         For any cheese pastry or fruit and custard pie crusts, work in       tasty shredded sharp Cheddar in the ratio of 1 to 4 parts of       flour.       Christmas Cake Sandwiches         A traditional Christmas carol begs for:        A little bit of spice cake      A little bit of cheese,      A glass of cold water,      A penny, if you please.         For a festive handout cut the spice cake or fruit cake in slices       and sandwich them with slices of tasty cheese between.         To maintain traditional Christmas cheer for the elders, serve       apple pie with cheese and applejack.       Angelic Camembert    1 ripe Camembert, imported  1 cup Anjou dry white wine  1/2 pound sweet butter, softened  2 tablespoons finely grated toast crumbs         Lightly scrape all crusty skin from the Camembert and when its       creamy interior stands revealed put it in a small, round covered       dish, pour in the wine, cover tightly so no bouquet or aroma can       possibly escape, and let stand overnight.         When ready to serve drain off and discard any wine left, dry the       cheese and mash with the sweet butter into an angelic paste.       Reshape in original Camembert form, dust thickly with the crumbs       and there you are.    Such a delicate dessert is a favorite with the ladies, since some of  them find a prime Camembert a bit too strong if taken straight.    Although A. W. Fulton's observation in _For Men Only_ is going out of  date, it is none the less amusing:         In the course of a somewhat varied career I have only met one       woman who appreciated cheese. This quality in her seemed to me so       deserving of reward that I did not hesitate to acquire her hand       in marriage.    Another writer has said that \"only gourmets among women seem to like  cheese, except farm women and foreigners.\" The association between  gourmets and farm women is borne out by the following urgent plea from  early Italian landowners:        _Ai contadini non far sapere      Quanta e buono it cacio con le pere_.      Don't let the peasants know      How good are cheese and pears.    Having found out for ourselves, we suggest a golden slice of Taleggio,  Stracchino, or pale gold Bel Paese to polish off a good dinner, with a  juicy Lombardy pear or its American equivalent, a Bartlett, let us  say.    This celestial association of cheese and pears is further accented by  the French:        _Entre la poire et le fromage_      Between the pear and the cheese.    This places the cheese after the fruit, as the last course, in  accordance with early English usage set down by John Clarke in his  _Paroemiologia_:        After cheese comes nothing.    But in his _Epigrams_ Ben Jonson serves them together.        Digestive cheese, and fruit there sure will be.    That brings us back to cheese and pippins:        I will make an end of my dinner; there's      pippins and cheese to come.        Shakespeare's _Merry Wives of Windsor_    When should the cheese be served? In England it is served before or  after the fruit, with or without the port.    Following _The Book of Keruynge_ in modern spelling we note when it  was published in 1431 the proper thing \"after meat\" was \"pears, nuts,  strawberries, whortleberries (American huckleberries) and hard  cheese.\" In modern practice we serve some suitable cheese like  Camembert directly on slices of apple and pears, Gorgonzola on sliced  banana, Hable spread on pineapple and a cheese dessert tray to match  the Lazy Lou, with everything crunchy down to Crackerjacks. Good, too,  are figs, both fresh and preserved, stuffed with cream cheese,  kumquats, avocados, fruity dunking mixtures of Pineapple cheese,  served in the scooped-out casque of the cheese itself, and apple or  pear and Provolone creamed and put back in the rind it came in. Pots  of liquored and wined cheeses, no end, those of your own making being  the best.       Champagned Roquefort or Gorgonzola    1/2 pound mellow Roquefort  1/4 pound sweet butter, softened  A dash cayenne  3/4 cup champagne         With a silver fork mix cheese and butter to a smooth paste,       moistening with champagne as you go along, using a little more or       less champagne according to consistency desired. Serve with the       demitasse and cognac, offering, besides crackers, gilt       gingerbread in the style of Holland Dutch cheese tasters, or just       plain bread.    After dinner cheeses suggested by Phil Alpert are:    FROM FRANCE: Port-Salut, Roblochon, Coulommiers, Camembert, Brie,  Roquefort, Calvados (try it with a spot of Calvados, apple brandy)    FROM THE U.S.: Liederkranz, Blue, Cheddar    FROM SWEDEN: Hable Creme Chantilly    FROM ITALY: Taleggio, Gorgonzola, Provolone, Bel Paese    FROM HUNGARY: Kascaval    FROM SWITZERLAND: Swiss Gruyere    FROM GERMANY: Kuemmelkaese    FROM NORWAY: Gjetost, Bondost    FROM HOLLAND: Edam, Gouda    FROM ENGLAND: Stilton    FROM POLAND: Warshawski Syr          [Illustration]    _Chapter Nine_    Au Gratin, Soups, Salads and Sauces      He who says _au gratin_ says Parmesan. Thomas Gray, the English poet,  saluted it two centuries ago with:        Parma, the happy country where huge cheeses grow.    On September 4, 1666, Pepys recorded the burying of his pet Parmesan,  \"as well as my wine and some other things,\" in a pit in Sir W.  Batten's garden. And on the selfsame fourth of September, more than a  century later, in 1784, Woodforde in his _Diary of a Country Parson_  wrote:         I sent Mr. Custance about 3 doz. more of apricots, and he sent me       back another large piece of fine Parmesan cheese. It was very       kind of him.    The second most popular cheese for _au gratin_ is Italian Romano, and,  for an entirely different flavor, Swiss Sapsago. The French, who gave  us this cookery term, use it in its original meaning for any dish with  a browned topping, usually of bread crumbs, or crumbs and cheese. In  America we think of _au gratin_ as grated cheese only, although  Webster says, \"with a browned covering, often mixed with butter or  cheese; as, potatoes _au gratin_.\" So let us begin with that.       Potatoes au Gratin    2 cups diced cooked potatoes  2 tablespoons grated onion  1/2 cup grated American Cheddar cheese  2 tablespoons butter  1/2 cup milk  1 egg  Salt  Pepper  More grated cheese for covering         In a buttered baking dish put a layer of diced potatoes, sprinkle       with onion and bits of butter. Next, scatter on a thin layer of       cheese and alternate with potatoes, onions and butter. Stir milk,       egg, salt and pepper together and pour it on the mixture. Top       everything with plenty of grated cheese to make it authentically       American _au gratin_. Bake until firm in moderate oven, about 1/2       hour.       Eggs au Gratin         Make a white sauce flavored with minced onion to pour over any       desired number of eggs broken into a buttered baking dish. Begin       by using half of the sauce and sprinkling on a lot of grated       cheese. After the eggs are in, pour on the rest of the sauce,       cover it with grated cheese and bread crumbs, drop in bits of       butter, and cook until brown in oven (or about 12 minutes).       Tomatoes au Gratin         Cover bottom of shallow baking pan with slices of tomato and       sprinkle liberally with bread crumbs and grated cheese, season       with salt, pepper and dots of butter, add another layer of       tomato slices, season as before and continue this, alternating       with cheese, until pan is full. Add a generous topping of crumbs,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14297"],[0,"The Congo and Coasts of Africa (#19)"],[1,"most charming. Back of the palace is an  enormously long building under one roof. Here live his thirty-five  queens. To them we were not presented.     [Illustration: The Palace of the King of the Cameroons.]    Prince William asked me if I knew where in America there was a  street called Fifth Avenue. I suggested New York. He referred to a  large Bible, and finding, much to his surprise, that my guess was  correct, commissioned me to buy him, from a firm on that street,  just such another Bible as the one in his hand. He forgot to give me  the money to pay for it, but loaned us a half-dozen little princes  to bear our purchases to the wharf. For this service their royal  highnesses graciously condescended to receive a small \"dash,\" and  with the chief clerk were especially delighted. He, being a  sleight-of-hand artist, apparently took five-franc pieces out of  their Sunday clothes and from their kinky hair. When we left they  were rapidly disrobing to find if any more five-franc pieces were  concealed about their persons.    The morning after we sailed from Duala we anchored in the river in  front of Calabar, the capital of Southern Nigeria. Of all the ports  at which we touched on the Coast, Calabar was the hottest, the best  looking, and the best administered. It is a model colony, but to  bring it to the state it now enjoys has cost sums of money entirely  out of proportion to those the colony has earned. The money has been  spent in cutting down the jungle, filling in swamps that breed  mosquitoes and fever, and in laying out gravel walks, water mains,  and open cement gutters, and in erecting model hospitals, barracks,  and administrative offices. Even grass has been made to grow, and  the high bluff upon which are situated the homes of the white  officials and Government House has been trimmed and cultivated and  tamed until it looks like an English park. It is a complete  imitation, even to golf links and tennis courts. But the fight that  has been made against the jungle has not stopped with golf links. In  1896 the death rate was ten men out of every hundred. That  corresponds to what in warfare is a decimating fire, upon which an  officer, without danger of reproof, may withdraw his men. But at  Calabar the English doctors did not withdraw, and now the death rate  is as low as three out of every hundred. That Calabar, or any part  of the West Coast, will ever be made entirely healthy is doubtful.  Man can cut down a forest and fill in a swamp, but he can not reach  up, as to a gas jet, and turn off the sun. And at Calabar, even at  night when the sun has turned itself off, the humidity and the heat  leave one sweating, tossing, and gasping for air. In Calabar the  first thing a white man learns is not to take any liberties with the  sun. When he dresses, eats, drinks, and moves about the sun is as  constantly on his mind, as it is on the face of the sun-dial. The  chief ascent to the top of the bluff where the white people live is  up a steep cement walk about eighty yards long. At the foot of this  a white man will be met by four hammock-bearers, and you will see  him get into the hammock and be carried in it the eighty yards.    For even that short distance he is taking no chances. But while he  nurses his vitality and cares for his health he does not use the sun  as an excuse for laziness or for slipshod work. I have never seen a  place in the tropics where, in spite of the handicap of damp, fierce  heat, the officers and civil officials are so keenly and constantly  employed, where the bright work was so bright, and the whitewash so  white.    Out at the barracks of the West African Frontier Force, the  W.A.F.F.'s, the officers, instead of from the shade of the veranda  watching the non-coms. teach a native the manual, were themselves at  work, and each was howling orders at the black recruits and smashing  a gun against his hip and shoulder as smartly as a drill sergeant. I  found the standard maintained at Calabar the more interesting  because the men were almost entirely their own audience. If they  make the place healthy, and attractive-looking, and dress for  dinner, and shy at cocktails, and insist that their tan shoes shall  glow like meershaum pipes, it is not because of the refining  presence of lovely women, but because the men themselves like things  that way. The men of Calabar have learned that when the sun is at  110, morals, like material things, disintegrate, and that, though  the temptation is to go about in bath-room slippers and pajamas, one  is wiser to bolster up his drenched and drooping spirit with a stiff  shirt front and a mess jacket. They tell that in a bush station in  upper Nigeria, one officer got his D.S.O. because with an audience  of only a white sergeant he persisted in a habit of shaving twice a  day.     [Illustration: The Home of the Thirty Queens of King Mango Bell.]    There are very few women in Calabar. There are three or four who are  wives of officials, two nurses employed by the government, and the  Mother Superior and Sisters of the Order of St. Joseph, and, of  course, all of them are great belles. For the Sisters, especially  the officers, the government people, the traders, the natives, even  the rival missionaries, have the most tremendous respect and  admiration. The sacrifice of the woman who, to be near her husband  on the Coast, consents to sicken and fade and grow old before her  time, and of the nurse who, to preserve the health of others, risks  her own, is very great; but the sacrifice of the Sisters, who have  renounced all thought of home and husband, and who have exiled  themselves to this steaming swamp-land, seems the most unselfish. In  order to support the 150 little black boys and girls who are at  school at the mission, the Sisters rob themselves of everything  except the little that will keep them alive. Two, in addition to  their work at the mission, act as nurses in the English hospital,  and for that they receive together $600. This forms the sole regular  income of the five women; for each $120 a year. With anything else  that is given them in charity, they buy supplies for the little  converts. They live in a house of sandstone and zinc that holds the  heat like a flat-iron, they are obliged to wear a uniform that is of  material and fashion so unsuited to the tropics that Dr. Chichester,  in charge of the hospital, has written in protest against it to  Rome, and on many days they fast, not because the Church bids them  so to do, but because they have no food. And with it all, these five  gentlewomen are always eager, cheerful, sweet of temper, and a  living blessing to all who meet them. What now troubles them is that  they have no room to accommodate the many young heathen who come to  them to be taught to wear clothes, and to be good little boys and  girls. This is causing the Sisters great distress. Any one who does  not believe in that selfish theory, that charity begins at home, but  who would like to help to spread Christianity in darkest Africa and  give happiness to five noble women, who are giving their lives for  others, should send a postal money order to Marie T. Martin, the  Reverend Mother Superior of the Catholic Mission of Old Calabar,  Southern Nigeria.    And if you are going to do it, as they say in the advertising pages,  \"Do it now!\"     [Illustration: The Mother Superior and Sisters of St. Joseph and   Their Converts at Old Calabar.]    At Calabar there is a royal prisoner, the King of Benin. He is not  an agreeable king like His Majesty of the Cameroons, but a grossly  fat, sensual-looking young man, who, a few years ago, when he was at  war with the English, made \"ju ju\" against them by sacrificing three  hundred maidens, his idea being that the ju ju would drive the  English out of Benin. It was poor ju ju, for it drove the young man  himself out of Benin, and now he is a king in exile. As far as I  could see, the social position of the king is insecure, and  certainly in Calabar he does not move in the first circles. One  afternoon, when the four or five ladies of Calabar and Mr. Bedwell,  the Acting Commissioner, and the officers of the W.A.F.F.'s were at  the clubhouse having ice-drinks, the king at the head of a retinue  of cabinet officers, high priests, and wives bore down upon the  club-house with the evident intention of inviting himself to tea.  Personally, I should like to have met a young man who could murder  three hundred girls and worry over it so little that he had not lost  one of his three hundred pounds, but the others were considerably  annoyed and sent an A.D.C. to tell him to \"Move on!\" as though he  were an organ-grinder, or a performing bear.    \"These kings,\" exclaimed a subaltern of the W.A.F.F.'s, indignantly,  \"are trying to push in everywhere!\"    When we departed from Calabar, the only thing that reconciled me to  leaving it and its charming people, was the fact that when the ship  moved there was a breeze. While at anchor in the river I had found  that not being able to breathe by day or to sleep by night in time  is trying, even to the stoutest constitution.    One of the married ladies of Calabar, her husband, an officer of  the W.A.F.F.'s, and the captain of the police sailed on the  _Nigeria_ \"on leave,\" and all Calabar came down to do them honor.  There was the commissioner's gig, and the marine captain's gig, and  the police captain's gig, and the gig from \"Matilda's,\" the English  trading house, and one from the Dutch house and the French house,  and each gig was manned by black boys in beautiful uniforms and  fezzes, and each crew fought to tie up to the foot of the  accommodation ladder. It was as gay as a regatta. On the  quarter-deck the officers drank champagne, in the captain's cabin  Hughes treated the traders to beer, in the \"square\" the non-coms. of  the W.A.F.F.'s drank ale. The men who were going away on leave tried  not to look too happy, and"]]]
