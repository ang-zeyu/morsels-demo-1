And the female slaves  assemble and play, and afterwards beat and throw stones at each other,  as they did then, when they helped the Romans to fight. These accounts  are admitted by but few historians, and indeed the calling out one  another's names in the daytime, and walking down to the Goats' Marsh  seems more applicable to the former story, unless, indeed, both of these  events happened on the same day.    Romulus is said to have been fifty-four years old, and to be in the  thirty-eighth year of his reign when he disappeared from the world.          COMPARISON OF THESEUS AND ROMULUS.      I. The above are all the noteworthy particulars which we have been able  to collect about Theseus and Romulus. It seems, in the first place, that  Theseus of his own free will, and without any compulsion, when he might  have reigned peacefully in Troezen, where he was heir to the kingdom, no  mean one, longed to accomplish heroic deeds: whereas Romulus was an  exile, and in the position of a slave; the fear of death was hanging  over him if unsuccessful, and so, as Plato says, he was made brave by  sheer terror, and through fear of suffering death and torture was forced  into doing great exploits. Moreover, Romulus's greatest achievement was  the slaying of one man, the despot of Alba, whereas Skeiron, Sinis,  Prokrustes, and Korynetes were merely the accompaniments and prelude to  the greater actions of Theseus, and by slaying them he freed Greece from  terrible scourges, before those whom he saved even knew who he was. He  also might have sailed peacefully over the sea to Athens, and had no  trouble with those brigands, whereas Romulus could not be free from  trouble while Amulius lived. And it is a great argument in favour of  Theseus that he attacked those wicked men for the sake of others, having  himself suffered no wrong at their hands; whereas the twins were  unconcerned at Amulius's tyranny so long as it did not affect  themselves. And although it may have been a great exploit to receive a  wound in fighting the Sabines, and to slay Acron, and to kill many  enemies in battle, yet we may compare with these, on Theseus's behalf,  his battle with the Centaurs and his campaign against the Amazons. As  for the courage which Theseus showed in the matter of the Cretan  tribute, when he voluntarily sailed to Crete with the youths and  maidens, whether the penalty was to be given to the Minotaur to eat, or  be sacrificed at the tomb of Androgeus, or even to be cast into  dishonoured slavery under an insolent enemy, which is the least  miserable fate mentioned by any writer, what a strength of mind, what  public spirit and love of fame it shows! In this instance it seems to me  that philosophers have truly defined love as a \"service designed by the  gods for the care and preservation of the young.\" For the love of  Ariadne seems to have been specially intended by Heaven to save Theseus;  nor need we blame her for her passion, but rather wonder that all men  and women did not share it. If she alone felt it, then I say she  deserved the love of a god, because of her zeal for all that is best and  noblest.    II. Both were born statesmen, yet neither behaved himself as a king  should do, but, from similar motives, the one erred on the side of  democracy, the other on that of despotism. The first duty of a king is  to preserve his crown; and this can be effected as well by refraining  from improperly extending his rights as by too great eagerness to keep  them. For he who either gives up or overstrains his prerogative ceases  to be a king or constitutional ruler, but becomes either a despot or  demagogue; and in the one case is feared, in the other despised by his  subjects. Still the one is the result of kindliness of disposition, and  the other that of selfishness and ferocity.    III. If we are not to attribute their misfortunes to chance, but to  peculiarities of disposition, then we cannot acquit Romulus of blame in  his treatment of his brother, nor Theseus in that of his son; but the  greatest excuse must be made for the one who acted under the greatest  provocation. One would not have thought that Romulus would have flown  into such a passion during a grave deliberation on matters of state;  while Theseus was misled, in his treatment of his son, by love and  jealousy and a woman's slander, influences which few men are able to  withstand. And what is more, Romulus's fury resulted in actual deeds of  unfortunate result; whereas the anger of Theseus spent itself in words  and an old man's curses, and the youth seems to have owed the rest of  his suffering to chance; so here, at any rate, one would give one's  vote for Theseus.    IV. Romulus, however, has the credit of having started with the most  slender resources, and yet of having succeeded. The twins were called  slaves and the sons of a swineherd before they achieved their liberty;  yet they freed nearly all the Latin race, and at one and the same time  gained those titles which are the most glorious among men, of slayers of  their enemies, preservers of their own house, kings of their own nation,  and founders of a new city, not by transferring the population of old  ones, as Theseus did, when he brought together many towns into one, and  destroyed many cities that bore the names of kings and heroes of old.  Romulus did this afterwards, when he compelled his conquered enemies to  cast down and obliterate their own dwellings, and become fellow-citizens  with their conquerors; yet at first he did not change the site of his  city nor increase it, but starting with nothing to help him, he obtained  for himself territory, patrimony, sovereignty, family, marriage, and  relatives, and he killed no one, but conferred great benefits on those  who, instead of homeless vagrants, wished to become a people and  inhabitants of a city. He slew no brigands or robbers, but he conquered  kingdoms, took cities, and triumphed over kings and princes.    V. As for the misfortune of Remus, it seems doubtful whether Romulus  slew him with his own hand, as most writers attribute the act to others.  He certainly rescued his mother from death, and gloriously replaced his  grandfather, whom he found in an ignoble and servile position, on the  throne of Aeneas. He did him many kindnesses, and never harmed him even  against his will. But I can scarcely imagine that Theseus's  forgetfulness and carelessness in hoisting the black sail can, by any  excuses or before the mildest judges, come much short of parricide:  indeed, an Athenian, seeing how hard it is even for his admirers to  exculpate him, has made up a story that Aegeus, when the ship was  approaching, hurriedly ran up to the acropolis to view it, and fell  down, as though he were unattended, or would hurry along the road to the  shore without servants.    VI. The crimes of Theseus in carrying off women are without any decent  excuse; first, because he did it so often, for he carried off Ariadne  and Antiope and Anaxo of Troezen, and above all when he was an old man  he carried off Helen, when she was not yet grown up, and a mere child,  though he was past the age for even legitimate marriage. Besides, there  was no reason for it, for these Troezenian, Laconian, and Amazonian  maidens, besides their not being betrothed to him, were no worthier  mothers for his children than the Athenian daughters of Erechtheus and  Kekrops would have been, so we must suspect that these acts were done  out of mere riotous wantonness.    Now Romulus, though he carried off nearly eight hundred women, yet kept  only one, Hersilia, for himself, and distributed the others among the  unmarried citizens; and afterwards, by the respect, love, and justice  with which he treated them, proved that his wrongful violence was the  most admirable and politic contrivance for effecting the union of the  two nations. By means of it he welded them into one, and made it the  starting-point of harmony at home and strength abroad. The dignity,  love, and permanence with which he invested the institution of marriage  is proved by the fact that during two hundred and thirty years no man  separated from his wife or woman from her husband; but, just as in  Greece, very exact persons can mention the first instance of parricide  or matricide, so all the Romans know that Spurius Carvilius was the  first who put away his wife, upon a charge of barrenness. Events also  testify to the superior wisdom of Romulus, for, in consequence of that  intermarriage, the two kings and the two races shared the empire,  whereas, from the marriage of Theseus, the Athenians obtained no  alliance or intercourse with any nation, but only hatreds and wars and  deaths of citizens and at last the destruction of Aphidnae, and they  themselves escaped from the fate which Paris brought upon Troy, only by  the mercy of their enemies and their own entreaties and supplications.  The mother of Theseus, not nearly but quite, suffered the fate of  Hekuba, who was abandoned and given up by her son, unless the story of  her captivity is false, as I hope it is, together with much of the  rest.    Also the religious part of their histories makes a great distinction  between them. For Romulus's success was due to the great favour of  Heaven, whereas the oracle given to Aegeus, to refrain from all women in  foreign parts, seems to argue that the birth of Theseus took place  contrary to the will of the gods.          LIFE OF LYKURGUS.      I. With regard to Lykurgus the lawgiver there is nothing whatever that  is undisputed; as his birth, his travels, his death, and, besides all  this, his legislation, have all been related in various ways; and also  the dates of his birth do not in any way accord. Some say that he was  contemporary with Iphitus, and with him settled the conditions of the  Olympic truce; and among these is Aristotle the philosopher, who adduces  as a proof of it the quoit which is at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#19)"],[1,"saying that it has lacked cohesion, that  Pointillism in particular has led painting into an aimless path. It has  been wrong to see in Impressionism too exclusive a pretext for technical  researches, and a happy reaction has set in, which leads us back to-day,  after diverse tentative efforts (amongst others some unfortunate  attempts at symbolist painting), to the fine, recent school of the  \"Intimists\" and to the novel conception which a great and glorious  painter, Besnard, imposes upon the Salons, where the elect draw  inspiration from him. We can here only indicate with a few words the  considerable part played by Besnard: his clever work has proved that the  scientific colour principles of Impressionism may be applied, not to  realism, but to the highest thoughts, to ideologic painting most nobly  inspired by the modern intellectual preoccupations. He is the  transition between Impressionism and the art of to-morrow. Of pure  French lineage by his portraits and his nudes, which descend directly  from Largilliere and Ingres, he might have restricted himself to being  placed among the most learned Impressionists. His studies of reflections  and of complementary colours speak for this. But he has passed this  phase and has, with his decorations, returned to the psychical domain of  his strangely beautiful art. The \"Intimists,\" C. Cottet, Simon, Blanche,  Menard, Bussy, Lobre, Le Sidaner, Wery, Prinet, and Ernest Laurent, have  proved that they have profited by Impressionism, but have proceeded in  quite a different direction in trying to translate their real  perceptions. Some isolated artists, like the decorative painter Henri  Martin, who has enormous talent, have applied the Impressionist  technique to the expression of grand allegories, rather in the manner of  Puvis de Chavannes. The effort at getting away from mere cleverness and  escaping a too exclusive preoccupation with technique, and at the same  time acquiring serious knowledge, betrays itself in the whole position  of the young French School; and this will furnish us with a perfectly  natural conclusion, of which the following are the principal points:--    What we shall have to thank Impressionism for, will be moral and  material advantages of considerable importance. Morally it has rendered  an immense service to all art, because it has boldly attacked routine  and proved by the whole of its work that a combination of independent  producers could renew the aesthetic code of a country, without owing  anything to official encouragement. It has succeeded where important but  isolated creators have succumbed, because it has had the good fortune of  uniting a group of gifted men, four of whom will count among the  greatest French artists since the origin of national art. It has had the  qualities which overcome the hardest resistance: fecundity, courage and  sure originality. It has known how to find its strength by referring to  the true traditions of the national genius, which have happily  enlightened it and saved it from fundamental errors. It has, last, but  not least, inflicted an irremediable blow on academic convention and has  wrested from it the prestige of teaching which ruled tyrannically for  centuries past over the young artists. It has laid a violent hand upon a  tenacious and dangerous prejudice, upon a series of conventional notions  which were transmitted without consideration for the evolution of modern  life and intelligence. It has dared freely to protest against a  degenerated ideal which vainly parodied the old masters, pretending to  honour them. It has removed from the artistic soul of France a whole  order of pseudo-classic elements which worked against its blossoming,  and the School will never recover from this bold contradiction which has  rallied to it all the youthful. The moral principle of Impressionism has  been absolutely logical and sane, and that is why nothing has been able  to prevent its triumph.    Technically Impressionism has brought a complete renewal of pictorial  vision, substituting the beauty of character for the beauty of  proportions and finding adequate expression for the ideas and feelings  of its time, which constitutes the secret of all beautiful works. It has  taken up again a tradition and added to it a contemporary page. It will  have to be thanked for an important series of observations as regards  the analysis of light, and for an absolutely original conception of  drawing. Some years have been wasted by painters of little worth in  imitating it, and the Salons, formerly encumbered with academic  _pastiches_, have been encumbered with Impressionist _pastiches_. It  would be unfair to blame the Impressionists for it. They have shown by  their very career that they hated teaching and would never pretend to  teach. Impressionism is based upon irrefutable optic laws, but it is  neither a style, nor a method, likely ever to become a formula in its  turn. One may call upon this art for examples, but not for receipts. On  the contrary, its best teaching has been to encourage artists to become  absolutely independent and to search ardently for their own  individuality. It marks the decline of the School, and will not create a  new one which would soon become as fastidious as the other. It will only  appear, to those who will thoroughly understand it, as a precious  repertory of notes, and the young generation honours it intelligently by  not imitating it with servility.    Not that it is without its faults! It has been said, to belittle it,  that it only had the value of an interesting attempt, having only been  able to indicate some excellent intentions, without creating anything  perfect. This is inexact. It is absolutely evident, that Manet, Monet,  Renoir and Degas have signed some masterpieces which did not lose by  comparison with those in the Louvre, and the same might even be said of  their less illustrious friends. But it is also evident that the time  spent on research as well as on agitation and enervating controversies  pursued during twenty-five years, has been taken from men who could  otherwise have done better still. There has been a disparity between  Realism and the technique of Impressionism. Its realistic origin has  sometimes made it vulgar. It has often treated indifferent subjects in a  grand style, and it has too easily beheld life from the anecdotal side.  It has lacked psychologic synthesis (if we except Degas). It has too  willingly denied all that exists hidden under the apparent reality of  the universe and has affected to separate painting from the ideologic  faculties which rule over all art. Hatred of academic allegory,  defiance of symbolism, abstraction and romantic scenes, has led it to  refuse to occupy itself with a whole order of ideas, and it has had the  tendency of making the painter beyond all a workman. It was necessary at  the moment of its arrival, but it is no longer necessary now, and the  painters understand this themselves. Finally it has too often been  superficial even in obtaining effects; it has given way to the wish to  surprise the eyes, of playing with tones merely for love of cleverness.  It often causes one regret to see symphonies of magnificent colour  wasted here in pictures of boating men; and there, in pictures of cafe  corners; and we have arrived at a degree of complex intellectuality  which is no longer satisfied with these rudimentary themes. It has  indulged in useless exaggerations, faults of composition and of harmony,  and all this cannot be denied.    But it still remains fascinating and splendid for its gifts which will  always rouse enthusiasm: freedom, impetuousness, youth, brilliancy,  fervour, the joy of painting and the passion for beautiful light. It is,  on the whole, the greatest pictorial movement that France has beheld  since Delacroix, and it brings to a finish gloriously the nineteenth  century, inaugurating the present. It has accomplished the great deed of  having brought us again into the presence of our true national lineage,  far more so than Romanticism, which was mixed with foreign elements. We  have here painting of a kind which could only have been conceived in  France, and we have to go right back to Watteau in order to receive  again the same impression. Impressionism has brought us an almost  unhoped-for renaissance, and this constitutes its most undeniable claim  upon the gratitude of the race.    It has exercised a very appreciable influence upon foreign painting.  Among the principal painters attracted by its ideas and research, we  must mention, in Germany, Max Liebermann and Kuehl; in Norway, Thaulow;  in Denmark, Kroyer; in Belgium, Theo Van Rysselberghe, Emile Claus,  Verheyden, Heymans, Verstraete, and Baertson; in Italy, Boldini,  Segantini, and Michetti; in Spain, Zuloaga, Sorolla y Bastida, Dario de  Regoyos and Rusinol; in America, Alexander, Harrison, Sargent; and in  England, the painters of the Glasgow School, Lavery, Guthrie and the  late John Lewis Brown. All these men come within the active extension of  the French movement, and one may say that the honour of having first  recognised the truly national movement of this art must be given to  those foreign countries which have enriched their collections and  museums with works that were despised in the land which had witnessed  their birth. At the present moment the effects of this new vision are  felt all over the world, down to the very bosom of the academies; and at  the Salons, from which the Impressionists are still excluded, can be  witnessed an invasion of pictures inspired by them, which the most  retrograde juries dare not reject. In whatever measure the recent  painters accept Impressionism, they remain preoccupied with it, and even  those who love it not are forced to take it into account.    The Impressionist movement can therefore now be considered, apart from  all controversies, without vain attacks or exaggerated"]]]
