[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#19)"],[1," I despair of ever  receiving the same degree of pleasure from the most excellent  performances of genius, which I felt at that age from pieces which my  present judgment regards as trifling and contemptible. Every trivial  cause of pleasure is apt to affect the man of too sanguine a complexion:  his appetite is too keen to suffer his taste to be delicate; and he is  in all respects what Ovid says of himself in love,        Molle meum levibus cor est violabile telis,      Et semper causa est, cur ego semper amem.    One of this character can never be a refined judge; never what the  comic poet calls _elegans formarum spectator_. The excellence and force  of a composition must always he imperfectly estimated from its effect on  the minds of any, except we know the temper and character of those  minds. The most powerful effects of poetry and music have been  displayed, and perhaps are still displayed, where these arts are but in  a very low and imperfect state. The rude hearer is affected by the  principles which operate in these arts even in their rudest condition;  and he is not skilful enough to perceive the defects. But as the arts  advance towards their perfection, the science of criticism advances with  equal pace, and the pleasure of judges is frequently interrupted by the  faults which we discovered in the most finished compositions.    Before I leave this subject, I cannot help taking notice of an opinion  which many persons entertain, as if the taste were a separate faculty of  the mind, and distinct from the judgment and imagination; a species of  instinct, by which we are struck naturally, and at the first glance,  without any previous reasoning, with the excellences or the defects of a  composition. So far as the imagination, and the passions are concerned,  I believe it true, that the reason is little consulted; but where  disposition, where decorum, where congruity are concerned, in short,  wherever the best taste differs from the worst, I am convinced that the  understanding operates, and nothing else; and its operation is in  reality far from being always sudden, or, when it is sudden, it is often  far from being right. Men of the best taste by consideration come  frequently to change these early and precipitate judgments, which the  mind, from its aversion to neutrality and doubt, loves to form on the  spot. It is known that the taste (whatever it is) is improved exactly  as we improve our judgment, by extending our knowledge, by a steady  attention to our object, and by frequent exercise. They who have not  taken these methods, if their taste decides quickly, it is always  uncertainly; and their quickness is owing to their presumption and  rashness, and not to any sudden irradiation, that in a moment dispels  all darkness from their minds. But they who have cultivated that species  of knowledge which makes the object of taste, by degrees and habitually  attain not only a soundness but a readiness of judgment, as men do by  the same methods on all other occasions. At first they are obliged to  spell, but at last they read with ease and with celerity; but this  celerity of its operation is no proof that the taste is a distinct  faculty. Nobody, I believe, has attended the course of a discussion  which turned upon matters within the sphere of mere naked reason, but  must have observed the extreme readiness with which the whole process of  the argument is carried on, the grounds discovered, the objections  raised and answered, and the conclusions drawn from premises, with a  quickness altogether as great as the taste can be supposed to work with;  and yet where nothing but plain reason either is or can be suspected to  operate. To multiply principles for every different appearance is  useless, and unphilosophical too in a high degree.    This matter might be pursued much farther; but it is not the extent of  the subject which must prescribe our bounds, for what subject does not  branch out to infinity? It is the nature of our particular scheme, and  the single point of view in which we consider it, which ought to put a  stop to our researches.          A    PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY    INTO THE ORIGIN OF OUR IDEAS OF    THE SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL      PART I.      SECTION I.    NOVELTY.    The first and the simplest emotion which we discover in the human mind  is curiosity. By curiosity I mean whatever desire we have for, or  whatever pleasure we take in, novelty. We see children perpetually  running from place to place, to hunt out something new: they catch with  great eagerness, and with very little choice, at whatever comes before  them; their attention is engaged by everything, because everything has,  in that stage of life, the charm of novelty to recommend it. But as  those things, which engage us merely by their novelty, cannot attach us  for any length of time, curiosity is the most superficial of all the  affections; it changes its object perpetually; it has an appetite which  is very sharp, but very easily satisfied; and it has always an  appearance of giddiness, restlessness, and anxiety. Curiosity, from its  nature, is a very active principle; it quickly runs over the greatest  part of its objects, and soon exhausts the variety which is commonly to  be met with in nature; the same things make frequent returns, and they  return with less and less of any agreeable effect. In short, the  occurrences of life, by the time we come to know it a little, would be  incapable of affecting the mind with any other sensations than those of  loathing and weariness, if many things were not adapted to affect the  mind by means of other powers besides novelty in them, and of other  passions besides curiosity in ourselves. These powers and passions shall  be considered in their place. But, whatever these powers are, or upon  what principle soever they affect the mind, it is absolutely necessary  that they should not be exerted in those things which a daily and vulgar  use have brought into a stale unaffecting familiarity. Some degree of  novelty must be one of the materials in every instrument which works  upon the mind; and curiosity blends itself more or less with all our  passions.      SECTION II.    PAIN AND PLEASURE.    It seems, then, necessary towards moving the passions of people advanced  in life to any considerable degree, that the objects designed for that  purpose, besides their being in some measure new, should be capable of  exciting pain or pleasure from other causes. Pain and pleasure are  simple ideas, incapable of definition. People are not liable to be  mistaken in their feelings, but they are very frequently wrong in the  names they give them, and in their reasonings about them. Many are of  opinion, that pain arises necessarily from the removal of some pleasure;  as they think pleasure does from the ceasing or diminution of some pain.  For my part, I am rather inclined to imagine, that pain and pleasure,  in their most simple and natural manner of affecting, are each of a  positive nature, and by no means necessarily dependent on each other for  their existence. The human mind is often, and I think it is for the most  part, in a state neither of pain nor pleasure, which I call a state of  indifference. When I am carried from this state into a state of actual  pleasure, it does not appear necessary that I should pass through the  medium of any sort of pain. If in such a state of indifference, or ease,  or tranquillity, or call it what you please, you were to be suddenly  entertained with a concert of music; or suppose some object of a fine  shape, and bright, lively colors, to be presented before you; or imagine  your smell is gratified with the fragrance of a rose; or if, without any  previous thirst, you were to drink of some pleasant kind of wine, or to  taste of some sweetmeat without being hungry; in all the several senses,  of hearing, smelling, and tasting, you undoubtedly find a pleasure; yet,  if I inquire into the state of your mind previous to these  gratifications, you will hardly tell me that they found you in any kind  of pain; or, having satisfied these several senses with their several  pleasures, will you say that any pain has succeeded, though the pleasure  is absolutely over? Suppose, on the other hand, a man in the same state  of indifference to receive a violent blow, or to drink of some bitter  potion, or to have his ears wounded with some harsh and grating sound;  here is no removal of pleasure; and yet here is felt, his every sense  which is affected, a pain very distinguishable. It may be said, perhaps,  that the pain in these cases had its rise from the removal of the  pleasure which the man enjoyed before, though that pleasure was of so  low a degree as to be perceived only by the removal. But this seems to  me a subtilty that is not discoverable in nature. For if, previous to  the pain, I do not feel any actual pleasure, I have no reason to judge  that any such thing exists; since pleasure is only pleasure as it is  felt. The same may be said of pain, and with equal reason. I can never  persuade myself that pleasure and pain are mere relations, which can  only exist as they are contrasted; but I think I can discern clearly  that there are positive pains and pleasures, which do not at all depend  upon each other. Nothing is more certain to my own feelings than this.  There is nothing which I can distinguish in my mind with more clearness  than the three states, of indifference, of pleasure, and of pain. Every  one of these I can perceive without any sort of idea of its relation to  anything else. Caius is afflicted with a fit of the colic; this man is  actually in pain; stretch Caius upon the rack, he will feel a much  greater pain: but does this pain of the rack arise from the removal of  any pleasure? or is the fit of the colic a pleasure or a pain just as we  are pleased to consider it?      SECTION III.    THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REMOVAL OF PAIN AND"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#19)"],[1,"time near the sea  coast, he discovered a great number of the natives, apparently more than  could belong to that district, assembled at the mouth of a cave. The  party was within ten yards of them before they were perceived, and the  Governor had hardly time to make his people halt before numbers appeared  in arms. The man who seemed to take the lead, as he advanced made signs  for the English to retire, but when he saw Governor Phillip approach  alone, unarmed, and in a friendly manner, he gave his spear away and met  him with perfect confidence. In less than three minutes the English party  found itself surrounded by two hundred and twelve men; but nothing  occurred in this transaction which could in the least confirm the idea,  that the natives were accustomed to act with treachery, or inclined to  take any cruel advantage of superiority in numbers. The moment the  offered friendship was accepted on their side, they laid down their  spears and stone hatchets, and joined the party in the most amicable  manner. Numbers of women and children remained at a small distance, some  of whom the men afterwards brought down to receive the little articles  which were offered as presents. Nothing was seen among these people which  could at all prove that any of them had been engaged in the affray with  the rush-cutters; and the Governor parted with them on the most friendly  terms, but more convinced than ever of the necessity of treating them  with a proper degree of confidence, in order to prevent disagreement. Had  he gone up with all his party, or had he even hesitated a moment before  he advanced himself, making the signals of friendship, a lance would  probably have been thrown, after which nothing could have prevented a  rencounter, which in such circumstances must have been fatal.    Here was seen the finest stream of water that had hitherto been  discovered in the country, but the cove into which it runs lies very open  to the sea. When the natives saw that the English were going forward  towards the next cove, one of them, an old man, made signs that he might  be allowed to go first. He did so, and as soon as he had ascended the  hill, called out, holding up both his hands, (the usual signal of amity  among these people) to signify to the natives in the next cove that they  who were advancing were friends. The Governor's party did not, however,  descend to that cove, but saw about forty men, so that, unless they had  assembled themselves on some particular occasion, they must be more  numerous in that part than had been before imagined. Governor Phillip had  calculated before, from the parties he had seen, that in Botany Bay, Port  Jackson, Broken Bay, and all the intermediate country, the inhabitants  could not exceed one thousand five hundred. In crossing the hills at this  time between Botany Bay and Port Jackson, smoke was seen on the top of  Lansdown Hills, which seems to prove beyond a doubt, that the country is  inhabited as far as those mountains, which are not less than fifty miles  from the sea.    Further enquiries having given some reason to suppose, that one of the  natives had been murdered, and several wounded, previously to the attack  made upon the rush-cutters, Governor Phillip on his return, proclaimed  the reward of emancipation to any convict who should discover the  aggressors. This step, if it did not in this instance procure any  information, seemed likely to prevent such acts of violence in future.    No very good fortune had hitherto attended the live stock belonging to  the settlement, but the heaviest blow was yet to come. About this time  the two bulls and four cows, belonging to Government, and to the  Governor, having been left for a time by the man who was appointed to  attend them, strayed into the woods, and though they were traced to some  distance, never could be recovered. This was a loss which must be for  some time irreparable.    4 June 1788    The fourth of June was not suffered to pass without due celebration. It  was a day of remission from labour, and of general festivity throughout  the settlement. At sun-rise the Sirius and Supply fired each a salute of  twenty-one guns, and again at one o'clock, when the marines on shore also  saluted with three vollies. At sunset the same honours were a third time  repeated from the ships; large bonfires were lighted, and the whole camp  afforded a scene of joy. That there might not be any exception to the  happiness of this day, the four convicts who had been reprieved from  death, and banished to an island in the middle of the harbour, received a  full pardon, and were sent for to bear their part in the general  exultation. The Governor, in his letters, with that humanity which so  strongly distinguishes his character, says, he trusts that on this day  there was not a single heavy heart in this part of his Majesty's  dominions. His own house was the centre of conviviality to all who could  be admitted to that society, nor was any thing neglected which in such a  situation could mark a day of celebrity, consistently with propriety and  good order. Perhaps no birth-day was ever celebrated in more places, or  more remote from each other, than that of his Majesty on this day.    It was now, it seems, first generally known, that the name of Cumberland  County had been given by the Governor to this part of the territory. This  name had been fixed before the assembling of the first courts, for the  sake of preserving regularity in the form of the public acts, in which it  is usual to name the county. The boundaries fixed for Cumberland County  were, on the west, Carmarthen and Lansdown Hills: on the north, the  northern parts of Broken Bay; and to the southward, the southern parts of  Botany Bay. Thus including completely these three principal bays, and  leaving the chief place of settlement at Sydney Cove nearly in the  centre.    On the 22d of June was a slight shock of an earthquake, which did not  last more than two or three seconds. It was felt by most people in the  camp, and by the Governor himself, who heard at the same time a noise  from the southward, which he took at first for the report of guns fired  at a great distance.    24 June 1788    On the 24th, a convict who had absconded on the 5th, having been guilty  of a robbery, returned into the camp almost starved. He had hoped to  subsist in the woods, but found it impossible. One of the natives gave  him a fish, and then made signs for him to go away. He said, that  afterwards he joined a party of the natives, who would have burnt him,  but that with some difficulty he made his escape; and he pretended to  have seen the remains of a human body actually lying on a fire, but  little credit can be given to reports from such a quarter. He was of  opinion that the natives were at this time in great distress for food,  and said, that he had seen four of them dying in the woods, who made  signs for something to eat, as if they were perishing through hunger. It  is certain that very little fish could be caught at this time, and the  convict seemed desirous to suggest the notion that they supplied their  necessities occasionally with human flesh; but there seems to be no good  foundation for such an opinion. This man was tried for his offence,  pleaded guilty, and suffered with another criminal.    It was now sufficiently ascertained, that though the necessity of  subsisting so long chiefly upon salt provisions, and of remaining  encamped in very wet weather had produced the scurvy, and other disorders  common in such circumstances, the climate itself wherein this new  settlement is fixed is mild and salubrious. Heavy rains had generally  attended the changes of the moon during the winter months, but there had  not been any time that could properly be called a rainy season. The  clearing away of the woods will of course assist the circulation of air,  and continually increase the healthfulness of the place. Violent storms  of thunder and lightning sometimes happened, and Governor Phillip  observed the variation of his thermometer, in the shade, to amount  frequently to thirty-three degrees, between eight in the morning and two  in the afternoon. The report of the surgeon at this time is subjoined.    A RETURN OF SICK, ETC. JUNE 30, 1788.
