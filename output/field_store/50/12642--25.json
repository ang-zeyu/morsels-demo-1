How many the mothers who have dared not, out of  fear and dread, to mourn their slaughtered offspring! How numerous those  who, at eventide, were possessed of utmost wealth and affluence, and who,  when morning came, had fallen into utter abasement and destitution! No  land is there whose soil hath not been tinged with their blood, nor reach  of heaven unto which their sighs have not ascended. Throughout the years  the darts of affliction have unceasingly rained down from the clouds of  God's decree, yet despite all these calamities and tribulations, the flame  of divine love hath so blazed in their hearts that even should their  bodies be torn asunder they would not forsake their love of Him Who is the  Best-Beloved of the worlds, but would welcome with heart and soul whatever  might befall them in the path of God.    221 O King! The breezes of the grace of the All-Merciful have transformed  these servants and attracted them unto His Holy Court. \"The witness of a  true lover is upon his sleeve.\" Nevertheless, some of the outwardly  learned have troubled the luminous heart of the King of the Age concerning  these souls who revolve round the Tabernacle of the All-Merciful and who  seek to attain the Sanctuary of true knowledge. Would that the  world-adorning wish of His Majesty might decree that this Servant be  brought face to face with the divines of the age, and produce proofs and  testimonies in the presence of His Majesty the Shah! This Servant is  ready, and taketh hope in God, that such a gathering may be convened in  order that the truth of the matter may be made clear and manifest before  His Majesty the Shah. It is then for thee to command, and I stand ready  before the throne of thy sovereignty. Decide, then, for Me or against Me.    222 The All-Merciful saith in the Qur'an, His abiding testimony unto all  the peoples of the world: \"Wish ye then for death, if ye be men of  truth.\"(32) Behold how He hath declared the yearning for death to be the  touchstone of sincerity! And, in the luminous mirror of thy judgement, it  is doubtless clear and evident which people have chosen, in this day, to  lay down their lives in the path of the Beloved of the worlds. Indeed,  were the books supporting the beliefs of this people to be written with  the blood spilled in the path of God--exalted be His glory!--then countless  volumes would have already appeared amongst men for all to see.    223 How, We fain would ask, is it possible to impugn this people whose  deeds are in conformity with their words, and to give credence instead to  those who have refused to relinquish one jot of their worldly authority in  the path of Him Who is the Unconstrained? Some of the divines who have  declared this Servant an infidel have at no time met with Me. Never having  seen Me, or become acquainted with My purpose, they have nevertheless  spoken as they pleased and acted as they desired. Yet every claim  requireth a proof, not mere words and displays of outward piety.    224 In this connection the text of several passages from the Hidden Book  of Fatimih--the blessings of God be upon her!--which are relevant to the  present theme will be cited in the Persian tongue, that certain matters  which have ere now been hidden may be revealed before thy presence. The  people addressed in the aforementioned Book, which is today known as the  Hidden Words, are those who, though outwardly known for learning and  piety, are inwardly the slaves of self and passion.    225 He saith: O ye that are foolish, yet have a name to be wise! Wherefore  do ye wear the guise of the shepherd, when inwardly ye have become wolves,  intent upon My flock? Ye are even as the star, which riseth ere the dawn,  and which, though it seem radiant and luminous, leadeth the wayfarers of  My city astray into the paths of perdition.    226 And likewise He saith: O ye seeming fair yet inwardly foul! Ye are  like clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but  of which, when tested by the Divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea,  the sunbeam falls alike upon the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in  reflection even as doth the star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the  difference!    227 And also He saith: O essence of desire! At many a dawn have I turned  from the realms of the Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on the  bed of ease busied with others than Myself. Thereupon, even as the flash  of the spirit, I returned to the realms of celestial glory, and breathed  it not in My retreats above unto the hosts of holiness.    228 And again He saith: O bondslave of the world! Many a dawn hath the  breeze of My loving-kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed  of heedlessness fast asleep. Bewailing then thy plight it returned whence  it came.(33)    229 Therefore, in the exercise of the royal justice, it is not sufficient  to give ear to the claimant alone. God saith in the Qur'an, the unerring  Balance that distinguisheth truth from falsehood: \"O ye who believe! If a  wicked man come to you with news, clear it up at once, lest through  ignorance ye harm others, and afterward repent of what ye have done.\"(34)  The holy Traditions, moreover, contain the admonition: \"Believe not the  tale-bearer.\" Certain of the divines, who have never seen Us, have  misconceived the nature of Our Cause. Those, however, who have met Us will  testify that this Servant hath not spoken save in accordance with that  which God hath commanded in the Book, and that He hath called attention to  the following blessed verse--exalted be His Word: \"Do ye not disavow us  merely because we believe in God, and in what He hath sent down unto us,  and in what He had sent down aforetime?\"(35)    230 O King of the age! The eyes of these refugees are turned towards and  fixed upon the mercy of the Most Merciful. No doubt is there whatever that  these tribulations will be followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy,  and these dire adversities will be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity.  We fain would hope, however, that His Majesty the Shah will himself  examine these matters and bring hope to the hearts. That which We have  submitted to thy Majesty is indeed for thine highest good. And God,  verily, is a sufficient witness unto Me.    231 Glorified art Thou, O Lord My God! I bear witness that the heart of  the King is in truth between the fingers of Thy might. If it be Thy wish,  do Thou incline it, O My God, in the direction of charity and mercy. Thou,  verily, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Bountiful. No God is  there besides Thee, the All-Glorious, the One Whose help is sought by all.    232 Concerning the prerequisites of the learned, He saith: \"Whoso among  the learned guardeth his self, defendeth his faith, opposeth his desires,  and obeyeth his Lord's command, it is incumbent upon the generality of the  people to pattern themselves after him....\"(36) Should the King of the Age  reflect upon this utterance which hath streamed from the tongue of Him Who  is the Dayspring of the Revelation of the All-Merciful, he would perceive  that those who have been adorned with the attributes enumerated in this  holy Tradition are scarcer than the philosopher's stone; wherefore not  every man that layeth claim to knowledge deserveth to be believed.    233 Again concerning the divines of the Latter Days, He saith: \"The  religious doctors of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines  beneath the shadow of heaven. Out of them hath mischief proceeded, and  unto them it shall return.\" And again He saith: \"When the Standard of  Truth is made manifest, the people of both the East and the West curse  it.\"(37) Should anyone dispute these Traditions, this Servant will  undertake to establish their validity, since the details of their  transmission have been omitted here for the sake of brevity.    234 Those doctors who have indeed drunk of the cup of renunciation have  never interfered with this Servant. Thus, for example, Shaykh  Murtada(38)--may God exalt his station and cause him to repose beneath the  canopy of His grace!--showed forth kindness during Our sojourn in 'Iraq,  and never spoke of this Cause otherwise than as God hath given leave. We  beseech God to graciously assist all to do His will and pleasure.    235 Now, however, all have lost sight of every other consideration, and  are bent upon the persecution of this people. Thus, if it be inquired of  certain persons who, by the grace of their Lord, repose beneath the shadow  of thy royal mercy and enjoy countless favours, \"What service have ye  rendered in return for these royal favours? Have ye through wise policy  annexed a further territory to the realm? Have ye applied yourselves to  aught that would secure the welfare of the people, the prosperity of the  kingdom, and the lasting glory of the state?\", they will have no other  reply than to designate, justly or falsely, a group of people before thy  royal presence as Babis, and forthwith to engage in massacre and pillage.  In Tabriz, for instance, and in the Egyptian town of Mansuriyyih, a number  of this people were ransomed and large sums were seized, yet no account of  these matters was ever made in the court of thy presence.    236 The reason for which all these things have come to pass is that their  persecutors, finding these unfortunate ones without protection, have  forgone more weighty matters and occupied themselves instead with  harassing this afflicted people. Numerous confessions and divers creeds  abide peacefully beneath the shadow of thy sovereignty. Let this people be  also numbered with them. Nay, those who serve the King should be animated  by such lofty aims and sublime intentions as to continually strive to  bring all religions beneath the shelter of his shadow, and to rule over  them with perfect justice.    237 To enforce the laws of God"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#19)"],[1,"obtain true education in the  shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that  which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one  ocean.    The ninth Ishraq    The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of God's holy Will is  to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world; make it  not the cause of dissension and strife. The religion of God and His divine  law are the most potent instruments and the surest of all means for the  dawning of the light of unity amongst men. The progress of the world, the  development of nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all  who dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of God.  Religion bestoweth upon man the most precious of all gifts, offereth the  cup of prosperity, imparteth eternal life, and showereth imperishable  benefits upon mankind. It behoveth the chiefs and rulers of the world, and  in particular the Trustees of God's House of Justice, to endeavour to the  utmost of their power to safeguard its position, promote its interests and  exalt its station in the eyes of the world. In like manner it is incumbent  upon them to enquire into the conditions of their subjects and to acquaint  themselves with the affairs and activities of the divers communities in  their dominions. We call upon the manifestations of the power of God--the  sovereigns and rulers on earth--to bestir themselves and do all in their  power that haply they may banish discord from this world and illumine it  with the light of concord.    It is incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to and observe that which  hath streamed forth from Our Most Exalted Pen. God, the True One, beareth  Me witness, and every atom in existence is moved to testify that such  means as lead to the elevation, the advancement, the education, the  protection and the regeneration of the peoples of the earth have been  clearly set forth by Us and are revealed in the Holy Books and Tablets by  the Pen of Glory.    We entreat God to graciously aid His servants. What this Wronged One doth  expect from everyone is justice and fairness. Let no one be content with  mere hearing; rather doth it behove everyone to ponder that which this  Wronged One hath revealed. I swear by the Day-Star of utterance, shining  above the horizon of the Kingdom of the All-Merciful, had there been any  expounder or speaker discernible, We would not have made Ourself the  object of the censure, ridicule and slander of the people.    Upon Our arrival in 'Iraq We found the Cause of God sunk in deep apathy  and the breeze of divine revelation stilled. Most of the believers were  faint and dispirited, nay utterly lost and dead. Hence there was a second  blast on the Trumpet, whereupon the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these  blessed words: 'We have sounded the Trumpet for the second time.' Thus the  whole world was quickened through the vitalizing breaths of divine  revelation and inspiration.    Certain souls have now sallied forth from behind the veils, intent on  inflicting harm upon this Wronged One. They have hindered and denied the  outpouring of this priceless bounty.    O ye that judge with fairness! If this Cause is to be denied then what  other cause in this world can be vindicated or deemed worthy of  acceptance?    Such as have turned away from the Cause of God are diligently seeking to  collect the Holy Writings of this Revelation; and they have already,  through gestures of friendship, managed to secure certain of these  Writings from those who held them in their possession. Moreover, when they  meet the followers of any religion, they hold themselves out as believers  therein. Say, die ye in your wrath! Verily He hath appeared with so great  an authority that no man of vision, of hearing, of insight, of justice or  of equity can ever deny Him. Unto this beareth witness in this resplendent  Hour the Pen of Him Who is the Ancient of Days.    O Jalil! Upon thee be My glory. We exhort the loved ones of God to perform  good deeds that perchance they may be graciously assisted and may hold  fast to that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His Revelation.  The benefits arising from this divine utterance shall fall upon such as  observe His precepts. We beseech God to enable them to do that which is  pleasing and acceptable unto Him, to grant that they may deal equitably  and may observe justice in this all-compelling Cause, to acquaint them  with His Holy Writings and to direct their steps towards His straight  Path.    Our Exalted Herald--may the life of all else besides Him be offered up for  His sake--hath revealed certain laws. However, in the realm of His  Revelation these laws were made subject to Our sanction, hence this  Wronged One hath put some of them into effect by embodying them in the  Kitab-i-Aqdas in different words. Others We set aside. He holdeth in His  hand the authority. He doeth what He willeth and He ordaineth whatsoever  He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Praised. There are also  ordinances newly revealed. Blessed are they that attain. Blessed are they  that observe His precepts.    The people of God should make the utmost endeavour that perchance the fire  of hatred and malice which smouldereth in the breasts of kindreds and  peoples may, through the living waters of utterance and the exhortations  of Him Who is the Desire of the world, be quenched and the trees of human  existence may be adorned with wondrous and excellent fruit. He is, in  truth, the Admonisher, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.    May the brightness of His glory shining above the horizon of bounty rest  upon you, O people of Baha, upon every one who standeth firm and steadfast  and upon those that are well grounded in the Faith and are endued with  true understanding.    As to thy question concerning interest and profit on gold and silver: Some  years ago the following passage was revealed from the heaven of the  All-Merciful in honour of the one who beareth the name of God, entitled  Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin(49)--upon him be the glory of the Most Glorious.  He--exalted be His Word--saith: Many people stand in need of this. Because  if there were no prospect for gaining interest, the affairs of men would  suffer collapse or dislocation. One can seldom find a person who would  manifest such consideration towards his fellow-man, his countryman or  towards his own brother and would show such tender solicitude for him as  to be well-disposed to grant him a loan on benevolent terms.(50) Therefore  as a token of favour towards men We have prescribed that interest on money  should be treated like other business transactions that are current  amongst men. Thus, now that this lucid commandment hath descended from the  heaven of the Will of God, it is lawful and proper to charge interest on  money, that the people of the world may, in a spirit of amity and  fellowship and with joy and gladness, devotedly engage themselves in  magnifying the Name of Him Who is the Well-Beloved of all mankind. Verily  He ordaineth according to His Own choosing. He hath now made interest on  money lawful, even as He had made it unlawful in the past. Within His  grasp He holdeth the kingdom of authority. He doeth and ordaineth. He is  in truth the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.    Render thou thanks unto thy Lord, O Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, for this manifest  bounty.    Many ecclesiastics in Persia have, through innumerable designs and  devices, been feeding on illicit gains obtained by usury. They have  contrived ways to give its outward form a fair semblance of lawfulness.  They make a plaything of the laws and ordinances of God, but they  understand not.    However, this is a matter that should be practised with moderation and  fairness. Our Pen of Glory hath, as a token of wisdom and for the  convenience of the people, desisted from laying down its limit.  Nevertheless We exhort the loved ones of God to observe justice and  fairness, and to do that which would prompt the friends of God to evince  tender mercy and compassion towards each other. He is in truth the  Counsellor, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. God grant that all men  may be graciously aided to observe that which the Tongue of the One true  God hath uttered. And if they put into practice what We have set forth,  God--exalted be His glory--will assuredly double their portion through the  heaven of His bounty. Verily He is the Generous, the Forgiving, the  Compassionate. Praise be unto God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.    Nevertheless the conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the men  of the House of Justice that they may enforce them according to the  exigencies of the time and the dictates of wisdom.    Once again We exhort all believers to observe justice and fairness and to  show forth love and contentment. They are indeed the people of Baha, the  companions of the Crimson Ark. Upon them be the peace of God, the Lord of  all Names, the Creator of the heavens.                                 LAWH-I-HIKMAT (TABLET OF WISDOM)          _This Tablet was addressed to Aqa Muhammad, a distinguished      believer from the town of Qa'in, who was surnamed Nabil-i-Akbar      (see Memorials of the Faithful pages 1-5). Another distinguished      believer of Qa'in, Mulla Muhammad-'Ali, was known as      Nabil-i-Qa'ini (see Memorials of the Faithful pages 49-54). In the      abjad notation the name 'Muhammad' has the same numerical value as      'Nabil'._      THIS is an Epistle which the All-Merciful hath sent down from the Kingdom  of Utterance. It is truly a breath of life unto those who dwell in the  realm of creation. Glorified be the Lord of all worlds! In this Epistle  mention is made of him who magnifieth the Name of God, his Lord, and who  is named Nabil in a weighty Tablet.    O Muhammad!
