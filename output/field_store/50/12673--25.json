Pers. _nahid_) for  the Arabic name, and has otherwise also altered the legend considerably.    Schack never attempted to write original poems in Oriental form. The  Hafizian movement did not excite his enthusiasm, and for the trifling of  the average Hafizian singer he had no use whatever. In a poem by which  he conveys his thanks to the sultan for a distinction which the latter  had conferred on him he says:        Waer ich, so wie Firdusi, paradiesisch,      Ich bohrte dir die Perlen der Kaside      Und schlaenge dir das Halsband der Ghasele;      Allein wir Deutschen singen kaum hafisisch,      Und wenn wir orientalisch sind im Liede,      Durchtraben wir die Wuesten als Kamele. (Vol. x. p. 106.)    Even for Bodenstedt's Mirza Schaffy songs he has no great admiration:                  Gar viel bedeutet's nicht, mich duenkt!      Dem nur, was Rueckert laengst schon besser machte      Und Platen, bist du keuchend nachgehinkt. (Vol. x. p. 47.)      FOOTNOTES:    [230] Stimmen vom Ganges.

[233] We cite from the edition mentioned on p. vii.    [234] Strophen des Omar Chijam, Stuttg. 1878. The translation itself  dates from an earlier period than the year of publication. The author,  speaking of the delay in bringing it before the public, states that  Horace's nonumque prematur in annum could be applied in threefold  measure to this work (p. 118). Hence the translation was made about  1850, or a little later.    [235] Herder, Briefe zur Befoerderung der Humanitaet, x, ed.

Now that we have come to the end of our investigation, it may be well to  survey briefly the whole field and to summarize the results we have  reached.    We have seen that to mediaeval Europe India and Persia were lands of  magic and enchantment; their languages and literatures were utterly  unknown. Whatever influence these literatures exerted on that of Europe  was indirect and not recognized. Nor did the Portuguese discoveries  effect an immediate change. It was only by slow degrees that the West  obtained any knowledge of Eastern thought. The _Gulistan_ and _Bustan_  of Sa'di, some maxims of Bhartrhari and a few scattered fragments were  all that was known in Europe of Indic or Persian literature before the  end of the eighteenth century.    Then the epoch-making discoveries of Sir William Jones aroused the  attention of the Western world and laid the foundations of a new  science. New ideas of world-wide significance presented themselves to  the European mind. Nowhere were these ideas welcomed with more  enthusiasm than in Germany, the home of philological scholarship. Herder  pointed the way, and by means of translations and imitations tried to  introduce the treasures of Oriental thought into German literature. That  he did not meet with unqualified success was due, as we have seen, to  his one-sided didactic tendency. To him, however, belongs the credit of  the first impulse. Then Friedrich Schlegel founded the study of Sanskrit  in Germany, while at the same time Hammer was busily at work spreading a  knowledge of the Persian poets in Europe. The effect of the latter's  work was instantaneous, for, as has been pointed out, it was his  translation of Hafid that inspired the composition of Goethe's _Divan_  and thus started the Oriental movement in Germany.    We have examined the share which Rueckert, Platen, Bodenstedt and Schack  had in this movement and have touched briefly on the work of some of the  minor lights. It will be noticed that the Persian tendency found a far  greater number of followers than the Indic. And this is but natural. It  was far more easy to sing of wine, woman and roses in the manner of  Hafid, such as most of these poets conceived this manner to be, than to  assimilate and reproduce the philosophic and often involved poetry of  India. Add to this the charming form and the rich rhyme of Persian  poetry and we can readily understand why it won favor. But we can also  understand readily enough why most of the so-called Hafizian singing is  of very inferior quality. Those men who did the most serious work for  the West-Eastern movement in Germany, men like Rueckert and Schack, were  not one-sided in their studies. It was their earnest intention to offer  to their countrymen what was best in the literatures of both India and  Persia, and that they have carried out this intention nobly no one who  has followed this investigation will be disposed to deny.           *       *       *       *       *    It only remains to say a few words on the question of the value of this  Oriental movement to German literature. We are not inclined to put too  high an estimate on the poetry that arose under its influence. In fact,  we do not think that it has produced what may be called really great  poetry. It is significant that the fame of most of the poets considered  in this investigation does not rest on that part of their work which was  inspired by Oriental influence. We cannot possibly agree with the view  that would place Goethe's _Divan_ side by side with the master's best  productions. We do not believe that he ever would have become famous  through that. Platen's _Ghaselen_ have neither the merit nor the  reputation of his sonnets or his ballads. Even among the _Ghaselen_ and  _Oestliche Rosen_ of Rueckert, the finest poems, such as \"Sei mir  gegruesst\" and \"Du bist die Ruh,\" both immortalized by the genius of  Schubert, are precisely those that are least Oriental, and we think it  is safe to say that the _Liebesfruehling_ exceeds in fame any one of  Rueckert's Oriental collections, including the _Weisheit des Brahmanen_.  The exception to the rule is Bodenstedt. His reputation rests almost  solely on the Mirza Schaffy songs; but it will scarcely be pretended  that this is great poetry.    From what has been said it may be inferred that the chief value of the  Oriental movement does not consist in its original contributions to  German literature, but rather in the reproductions and translations it  inspired. For it was through these that the treasures of Eastern thought  were made the literary heritage, not of Germany alone, but of Europe. As  far as the literature of Germany itself is concerned, this movement was  of the greatest significance, in that it introduced the Oriental element  and thereby helped powerfully to impart to German letters the spirit of  cosmopolitanism for which men like Herder and Goethe had so earnestly  striven. The great writers of ancient Greece and Rome had long since  been familiar to the German people; Shakespere, Dante and Calderon had  likewise won a place by the side of the German classics through the  masterly work of the Romanticists; and now the spirit and form of a new  literature--light from the East--was brought in by the movement which  has been the subject of this investigation and assumed its place as a  recognized element in the literature of Germany. The fond dream of a  _Weltlitteratur_ thus became a reality, and the German language became  the medium of acquaintance with all that is best in the literature of  the world. The Oriental movement is the clearest proof of that spirit of  universality, which is at once the noblest trait and the proudest boast  of German genius.

I uttered a short cry, of which I was instantly ashamed, for Nayland  Smith's voice came:--    \"I startled you, eh, Petrie?\"    \"Smith,\" I said, \"how long have you been standing there?\"    \"I only returned in time to see our Fenimore Cooper friend retreating  through the window,\" he replied; \"but no doubt you had a good look at  him?\"    \"I had!\" I answered eagerly. \"It was Samarkan!\"    \"I thought so! I have suspected as much for a long time.\"    \"Was this the object of our visit here?\"    \"It was one of the objects,\" admitted Nayland Smith evasively.    From some place not far distant came the sound of a restarted engine.    \"The other,\" he added, \"was this: to enable M. Samarkan to read the  note which I had pinned upon the door!\"      CHAPTER XXI    THE SECOND MESSAGE      \"Here you are, Petrie,\" said Nayland Smith--and he tossed across the  table the folded copy of a morning paper. \"This may assist you in your  study of the first Zagazig message.\"    I set down my cup and turned my attention to the \"Personal\" column on  the front page of the journal. A paragraph appeared therein conceived  as follows:--    ZAGAZIG-_Z_-a-g-_a_;-z:-I:-_g_;z-a,g;-    A-,_z_;_i_:_G_,-z:_a_;_g_-A,z-_i_;-gz    _A_;_g_aZ-_i_;_g_-:a z i g    I stared across at my friend in extreme bewilderment.    \"But, Smith!\" I cried, \"these messages are utterly meaningless!\"    \"Not at all,\" he rapped back. \"Scotland Yard thought they were  meaningless at first, and I must admit that they suggested nothing to  me for a long time; but the dead dacoit was the clue to the first,  Petrie, and the note pinned upon the door of the house near the Oval  is the clue to the second.\"    Stupidly I continued to stare at him until he broke into a grim smile.    \"Surely you understand?\" he said. \"You remember where the dead Burman  was found?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    \"You know the street along which, ordinarily, one would approach the  wharf?\"    \"Three Colt Street?\"    \"Three Colt Street, exactly. Well, on the night that the Burman met  his end I had an appointment in Three Colt Street with Weymouth. The  appointment was made by 'phone, from the New Louvre! My cab broke down  and I never arrived. I discovered later that Weymouth had received a  telegram purporting to come from me, putting off the engagement.\"    \"I am aware of all this!\"    Nayland Smith burst into a loud laugh.    \"But _still_ you are fogged!\" he cried. \"Then I'm hanged if I'll pilot  you any farther! You have all the facts before you. There lies the  first Zagazig message; here is the second; and you know the context of  the note pinned upon the door? It read, if you remember, 'Remove  patrol from Joy-Shop neighborhood. Have a theory. Wish to visit place  alone on Monday night after one o'clock.'\"      \"Smith,\" I said dully, \"I have a heavy stake upon this murderous game.\"    His manner changed instantly; the tanned face grew grim and hard, but  the steely eyes softened strangely. He bent over me, clapping his hands  upon my shoulders.    \"I know it, old man,\" he replied; \"and because it may serve to keep  your mind busy during hours when otherwise it would be engaged with  profitless sorrows, I invite you to puzzle out this business for  yourself. You have nothing else to do until late to-night, and you can  work undisturbed, here, at any rate!\"    His words referred to the fact that, without surrendering our suite at  the New Louvre Hotel, we had gone upon a visit, of indefinite duration,  to a mythical friend; and now were quartered in furnished chambers  adjoining Fleet Street.    We had remained at the New Louvre long enough to secure confirmation  of our belief that a creature of Fu-Manchu spied upon us there; and  now we only awaited the termination of the night's affair to take  such steps as Smith might consider politic in regard to the sardonic  Greek who presided over London's newest and most palatial hotel.    Smith setting out for New Scotland Yard in order to make certain final  arrangements in connection with the business of the night, I began  closely to study the mysterious Zagazig messages, determined not to be  beaten, and remembering the words of Edgar Allan Poe--the strange  genius to whom we are indebted for the first workable system of  deciphering cryptograms: \"It may well be doubted whether human  ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity  may not, by proper application, resolve.\"    The first conclusion to which I was borne was this: that the letters  comprising the word \"Zagazig\" were designed merely to confuse the  reader, and might be neglected; since, occurring as they did in regular  sequence, they could possess no significance. I became quite excited  upon making the discovery that the _punctuation marks_ varied in  almost every case!    I immediately assumed that these constituted the cipher; and, seeking  for my key-letter, _e_ (that which most frequently occurs in the  English language), I found the sign of a full-stop to appear more  frequently than any other in the first message, namely ten times,  although it only occurred thrice in the second. Nevertheless, I was  hopeful ... until I discovered that in two cases it appeared three  times _in succession!_    There is no word in English, nor, so far as I am aware, in any language,  where this occurs, either in regard to _e_ or any other letter!      That unfortunate discovery seemed so wholly to destroy the very theory  upon which I relied, that I almost abandoned my investigation there  and then. Indeed, I doubt if I ever should have proceeded were it not  that by a piece of pure guesswork I blundered on to a clue.    I observed that certain letters, at irregularly occurring intervals,  were set in capital, and I divided up the message into corresponding  sections, in the hope that th capitals might indicate the  commencements of words. This accomplished, I set out upon a series  of guesses, basing these upon Smith's assurance that the death of the  dacoit afforded a clue to the first message and the note which he  (Smith) had pinned upon the door a clue to the second.    Such being my system--if I can honor my random attempts with the  title--I take little credit to myself for the fortunate result. In  short, I determined (although _e_ twice occurred where _r_ should have  been!) that the first message from the thirteenth letter, onwards to  the twenty-seventh (_id est:_ _I;_g:-zagAz;i-;_g_;_-Z_,-a;-_g_azi;-)  read:--    _\"Three Colt Street.\"_    Endeavoring, now, to eliminate the _e_ where _r_ should appear, I made  another discovery. The presence of a letter in _italics_ altered the  value of the sign which followed it!    From that point onward the task became child's-play, and I should  merely render this account tedious if I entered into further details.  Both messages commenced with the name \"Smith\" as I early perceived,  and half an hour of close study gave me the complete sentences, thus:--    1. _Smith passing Three Colt Street twelve-thirty Wednesday._    2. _Smith going Joy-Shop after one Monday._    The word \"Zagazig\" was completed, always, and did not necessarily  terminate with the last letter occurring in the cryptographic message.  A subsequent inspection of this curious code has enabled Nayland  Smith, by a process of simple deduction, to compile the entire alphabet  employed by Dr. Fu-Manchu's agent, Samarkan, in communicating with his  awful superior. With a little patience, any one of my readers my achieve  the same result (and I should be pleased to hear from those who succeed!).    This, then was the outcome of my labors; and although it enlightened me  to some extent, I realized that I still had much to learn.    The dacoit, apparently, had met his death at the very hour when Nayland  Smith should have been passing along Three Colt Street--a thoroughfare  with an unsavory reputation. Who had killed him?    To-night, Samarkan advised the Chinese doctor, Smith would again be in  the same dangerous neighborhood. A strange thrill of excitement swept  through me. I glanced at my watch. Yes! It was time for me to repair,  secretly, to my post. For I, too, had business on the borders of  Chinatown to-night.        CHAPTER XXII    THE SECRET OF THE WHARF      I sat in the evil-smelling little room with its low, blackened ceiling,  and strove to avoid making the slightest noise; but the crazy boards  creaked beneath me with every movement. The moon hung low in an almost  cloudless sky; for, following the spell of damp and foggy weather, a  fall in temperature had taken place, and there was a frosty snap in  the air to-night.    Through the open window the moonlight poured in and spilled its pure  luminance upon the filthy floor; but I kept religiously within the  shadows, so posted, however, that I could command an uninterrupted  view of the street from the point where it crossed the creek to that  where it terminated at the gates of the deserted wharf.    Above and below me the crazy building formerly known as the Joy-Shop  and once the nightly resort of the Asiatic riff-raff from the docks--  was silent, save for the squealing and scuffling of the rats. The  melancholy lapping of the water frequently reached my ears, and a more  or less continuous din from the wharves and workshops upon the further  bank of the Thames; but in the narrow, dingy streets immediately  surrounding the house, quietude reigned and no solitary footstep  disturbed it.    Once, looking down in the direction of the bridge, I gave a great  start, for a black patch of shadow moved swiftly across the path and  merged into the other shadows bordering a high wall. My heart leapt  momentarily, then, in another instant, the explanation of the mystery  became apparent--in the presence of a gaunt and prowling cat. Bestowing  a"]]]
