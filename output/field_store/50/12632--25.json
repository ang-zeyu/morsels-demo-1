Only the trained ear will  detect the difference and the manager can make more money.    Suppose our mercenary impresario were unable to get into the concert  hall of his famous rival. He would then listen outside the window and  analyze the sound in this fashion: \"Fifty per cent. of the sound is made  by the tuba, 20 per cent. by the bass drum, 15 per cent. by the 'cello  and 10 per cent. by the clarinet. There are some other instruments, but  they are not loud and I guess if we can leave them out nobody will know  the difference.\" So he makes up his orchestra out of these four alone  and many people do not know the difference.    The cheap perfumer goes about it in the same way. He analyzes, for  instance, the otto or oil of roses which cost during the war $400 a  pound--if you could get it at any price--and he finds that the chief  ingredient is geraniol, costing only $5, and next is citronelol, costing  $20; then comes nerol and others. So he makes up a cheap brand of  perfumery out of three or four such compounds. But the genuine oil of  roses, like other natural essences, contains a dozen or more  constituents and to leave many of them out is like reducing an orchestra  to a few loud-sounding instruments or a painting to a three-color print.  A few years ago an attempt was made to make music electrically by  producing separately each kind of sound vibration contained in the  instruments imitated. Theoretically that seems easy, but practically the  tone was not satisfactory because the tones and overtones of a full  orchestra or even of a single violin are too numerous and complex to be  reproduced individually. So the synthetic perfumes have not driven out  the natural perfumes, but, on the contrary, have aided and stimulated  the growth of flowers for essences. The otto or attar of roses, favorite  of the Persian monarchs and romances, has in recent years come chiefly  from Bulgaria. But wars are not made with rosewater and the Bulgars for  the last five years have been engaged in other business than cultivating  their own gardens. The alembic or still was invented by the Arabian  alchemists for the purpose of obtaining the essential oil or attar of  roses. But distillation, even with the aid of steam, is not altogether  satisfactory. For instance, the distilled rose oil contains anywhere  from 10 to 74 per cent. of a paraffin wax (stearopten) that is odorless  and, on the other hand, phenyl-ethyl alcohol, which is an important  constituent of the scent of roses, is broken up in the process of  distillation. So the perfumer can improve on the natural or rather the  distilled oil by leaving out part of the paraffin and adding the missing  alcohol. Even the imported article taken direct from the still is not  always genuine, for the wily Bulgar sometimes \"increases the yield\" by  sprinkling his roses in the vat with synthetic geraniol just as the wily  Italian pours a barrel of American cottonseed oil over his olives in the  press.    Another method of extracting the scent of flowers is by _enfleurage_,  which takes advantage of the tendency of fats to absorb odors. You know  how butter set beside fish in the ice box will get a fishy flavor. In  _enfleurage_ moist air is carried up a tower passing alternately over  trays of fresh flowers, say violets, and over glass plates covered with  a thin layer of lard. The perfumed lard may then be used as a pomade or  the perfume may be extracted by alcohol.    But many sweet flowers do not readily yield an essential oil, so in such  oases we have to rely altogether upon more or less successful  substitutes. For instance, the perfumes sold under the names of  \"heliotrope,\" \"lily of the valley,\" \"lilac,\" \"cyclamen,\" \"honeysuckle,\"  \"sweet pea,\" \"arbutus,\" \"mayflower\" and \"magnolia\" are not produced from  these flowers but are simply imitations made from other essences,  synthetic or natural. Among the \"thousand flowers\" that contribute to  the \"Eau de Mille Fleurs\" are the civet cat, the musk deer and the sperm  whale. Some of the published formulas for \"Jockey Club\" call for civet  or ambergris and those of \"Lavender Water\" for musk and civet. The less  said about the origin of these three animal perfumes the better.  Fortunately they are becoming too expensive to use and are being  displaced by synthetic products more agreeable to a refined imagination.  The musk deer may now be saved from extinction since we can make  tri-nitro-butyl-xylene from coal tar. This synthetic musk passes muster  to human nostrils, but a cat will turn up her nose at it. The synthetic  musk is not only much cheaper than the natural, but a dozen times as  strong, or let us say, goes a dozen times as far, for nobody wants it  any stronger.    Such powerful scents as these are only pleasant when highly diluted, yet  they are, as we have seen, essential ingredients of the finest perfumes.  For instance, the natural oil of jasmine and other flowers contain  traces of indols and skatols which have most disgusting odors. Though  our olfactory organs cannot detect their presence yet we perceive their  absence so they have to be put into the artificial perfume. Just so a  brief but violent discord in a piece of music or a glaring color  contrast in a painting may be necessary to the harmony of the whole.    It is absurd to object to \"artificial\" perfumes, for practically all  perfumes now sold are artificial in the sense of being compounded by the  art of the perfumer and whether the materials he uses are derived from  the flowers of yesteryear or of Carboniferous Era is nobody's business  but his. And he does not tell. The materials can be purchased in the  open market. Various recipes can be found in the books. But every famous  perfumer guards well the secret of his formulas and hands it as a legacy  to his posterity. The ancient Roman family of Frangipani has been made  immortal by one such hereditary recipe. The Farina family still claims  to have the exclusive knowledge of how to make Eau de Cologne. This  famous perfume was first compounded by an Italian, Giovanni Maria  Farina, who came to Cologne in 1709. It soon became fashionable and was  for a time the only scent allowed at some of the German courts. The  various published recipes contain from six to a dozen ingredients,  chiefly the oils of neroli, rosemary, bergamot, lemon and lavender  dissolved in very pure alcohol and allowed to age like wine. The  invention, in 1895, of artificial neroli (orange flowers) has improved  the product.    French perfumery, like the German, had its origin in Italy, when  Catherine de' Medici came to Paris as the bride of Henri II. She  brought with her, among other artists, her perfumer, Sieur Toubarelli,  who established himself in the flowery land of Grasse. Here for four  hundred years the industry has remained rooted and the family formulas  have been handed down from generation to generation. In the city of  Grasse there were at the outbreak of the war fifty establishments making  perfumes. The French perfumer does not confine himself to a single  sense. He appeals as well to sight and sound and association. He adds to  the attractiveness of his creation by a quaintly shaped bottle, an  artistic box and an enticing name such as \"Dans les Nues,\" \"Le Coeur de  Jeannette,\" \"Nuit de Chine,\" \"Un Air Embaume,\" \"Le Vertige,\" \"Bon Vieux  Temps,\" \"L'Heure Bleue,\" \"Nuit d'Amour,\" \"Quelques Fleurs,\" \"Djer-Kiss.\"    The requirements of a successful scent are very strict. A perfume must  be lasting, but not strong. All its ingredients must continue to  evaporate in the same proportion, otherwise it will change odor and  deteriorate. Scents kill one another as colors do. The minutest trace of  some impurity or foreign odor may spoil the whole effect. To mix the  ingredients in a vessel of any metal but aluminum or even to filter  through a tin funnel is likely to impair the perfume. The odoriferous  compounds are very sensitive and unstable bodies, otherwise they would  have no effect upon the olfactory organ. The combination that would be  suitable for a toilet water would not be good for a talcum powder and  might spoil in a soap. Perfumery is used even in the \"scentless\" powders  and soaps. In fact it is now used more extensively, if less intensively,  than ever before in the history of the world. During the Unwashed Ages,  commonly called the Dark Ages, between the destruction of the Roman  baths and the construction of the modern bathroom, the art of the  perfumer, like all the fine arts, suffered an eclipse. \"The odor of  sanctity\" was in highest esteem and what that odor was may be imagined  from reading the lives of the saints. But in the course of centuries the  refinements of life began to seep back into Europe from the East by  means of the Arabs and Crusaders, and chemistry, then chiefly the art of  cosmetics, began to revive. When science, the greatest democratizing  agent on earth, got into action it elevated the poor to the ranks of  kings and priests in the delights of the palate and the nose. We should  not despise these delights, for the pleasure they confer is greater, in  amount at least, than that of the so-called higher senses. We eat three  times a day; some of us drink oftener; few of us visit the concert hall  or the art gallery as often as we do the dining room. Then, too, these  primitive senses have a stronger influence upon our emotional nature  than those acquired later in the course of evolution. As Kipling puts  it:      Smells are surer than sounds or sights    To make your heart-strings crack.          VI    CELLULOSE      Organic compounds, on which our life and living depend, consist chiefly  of four elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. These compounds  are sometimes hard to analyze, but when once the chemist has ascertained  their constitution he can usually make them out of their elements--if he  wants to.

He would not have delegated that  mission to the President of the United States. He had awaited the day  with impatience equal to mine, and the visions he saw as he hurried us  over the sun-flecked pavements transcended all my dreams. Almost his  first act on landing on American soil, three years before, had been his  application for naturalization. He had taken the remaining steps in the  process with eager promptness, and at the earliest moment allowed by the  law, he became a citizen of the United States. It is true that he had  left home in search of bread for his hungry family, but he went blessing  the necessity that drove him to America. The boasted freedom of the New  World meant to him far more than the right to reside, travel, and work  wherever he pleased; it meant the freedom to speak his thoughts, to  throw off the shackles of superstition, to test his own fate, unhindered  by political or religious tyranny. He was only a young man when he  landed--thirty-two; and most of his life he had been held in  leading-strings. He was hungry for his untasted manhood.    Three years passed in sordid struggle and disappointment. He was not  prepared to make a living even in America, where the day laborer eats  wheat instead of rye. Apparently the American flag could not protect him  against the pursuing Nemesis of his limitations; he must expiate the  sins of his fathers who slept across the seas. He had been endowed at  birth with a poor constitution, a nervous, restless temperament, and an  abundance of hindering prejudices. In his boyhood his body was starved,  that his mind might be stuffed with useless learning. In his youth this  dearly gotten learning was sold, and the price was the bread and salt  which he had not been trained to earn for himself. Under the wedding  canopy he was bound for life to a girl whose features were still strange  to him; and he was bidden to multiply himself, that sacred learning  might be perpetuated in his sons, to the glory of the God of his  fathers. All this while he had been led about as a creature without a  will, a chattel, an instrument. In his maturity he awoke, and found  himself poor in health, poor in purse, poor in useful knowledge, and  hampered on all sides. At the first nod of opportunity he broke away  from his prison, and strove to atone for his wasted youth by a life of  useful labor; while at the same time he sought to lighten the gloom of  his narrow scholarship by freely partaking of modern ideas. But his  utmost endeavor still left him far from his goal. In business nothing  prospered with him. Some fault of hand or mind or temperament led him to  failure where other men found success. Wherever the blame for his  disabilities be placed, he reaped their bitter fruit. \"Give me bread!\"  he cried to America. \"What will you do to earn it?\" the challenge came  back. And he found that he was master of no art, of no trade; that even  his precious learning was of no avail, because he had only the most  antiquated methods of communicating it.    So in his primary quest he had failed. There was left him the  compensation of intellectual freedom. That he sought to realize in every  possible way. He had very little opportunity to prosecute his education,  which, in truth, had never been begun. His struggle for a bare living  left him no time to take advantage of the public evening school; but he  lost nothing of what was to be learned through reading, through  attendance at public meetings, through exercising the rights of  citizenship. Even here he was hindered by a natural inability to acquire  the English language. In time, indeed, he learned to read, to follow a  conversation or lecture; but he never learned to write correctly, and  his pronunciation remains extremely foreign to this day.    If education, culture, the higher life were shining things to be  worshipped from afar, he had still a means left whereby he could draw  one step nearer to them. He could send his children to school, to learn  all those things that he knew by fame to be desirable. The common  school, at least, perhaps high school; for one or two, perhaps even  college! His children should be students, should fill his house with  books and intellectual company; and thus he would walk by proxy in the  Elysian Fields of liberal learning. As for the children themselves, he  knew no surer way to their advancement and happiness.    So it was with a heart full of longing and hope that my father led us  to school on that first day. He took long strides in his eagerness, the  rest of us running and hopping to keep up.    At last the four of us stood around the teacher's desk; and my father,  in his impossible English, gave us over in her charge, with some broken  word of his hopes for us that his swelling heart could no longer  contain. I venture to say that Miss Nixon was struck by something  uncommon in the group we made, something outside of Semitic features and  the abashed manner of the alien. My little sister was as pretty as a  doll, with her clear pink-and-white face, short golden curls, and eyes  like blue violets when you caught them looking up. My brother might have  been a girl, too, with his cherubic contours of face, rich red color,  glossy black hair, and fine eyebrows. Whatever secret fears were in his  heart, remembering his former teachers, who had taught with the rod, he  stood up straight and uncringing before the American teacher, his cap  respectfully doffed. Next to him stood a starved-looking girl with eyes  ready to pop out, and short dark curls that would not have made much of  a wig for a Jewish bride.    All three children carried themselves rather better than the common run  of \"green\" pupils that were brought to Miss Nixon. But the figure that  challenged attention to the group was the tall, straight father, with  his earnest face and fine forehead, nervous hands eloquent in gesture,  and a voice full of feeling. This foreigner, who brought his children to  school as if it were an act of consecration, who regarded the teacher of  the primer class with reverence, who spoke of visions, like a man  inspired, in a common schoolroom, was not like other aliens, who  brought their children in dull obedience to the law; was not like the  native fathers, who brought their unmanageable boys, glad to be relieved  of their care. I think Miss Nixon guessed what my father's best English  could not convey. I think she divined that by the simple act of  delivering our school certificates to her he took possession of America.
