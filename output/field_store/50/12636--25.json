[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#19)"],[1," perhaps another authorized  scourge of God.    I will not strain the parallel further than it will bear, but I would  suggest that causes somewhat analogous to these are now at work among  the Mussulmans of the still independent states of Islam, and that they  are operating somewhat in the same direction. The Mussulman peasantry,  especially of the Ottoman Empire, are miserable, and they know that they  are so, and they look in vain to their religion to protect them, as in  former days, against their rulers. They find that all their world now is  corrupt--that the law is broken daily by those who should enforce the  law; that the illegalities of those who ruin them are constantly  condoned by a conniving body of the Ulema; that for all practical  purposes of justice and mercy religion has abdicated its claim to direct  and govern. They have learned, too, by their intercourse with strangers,  and in the towns by the newspapers which they now eagerly read, that  this has not been always so, and that servitude is not the natural state  of man or acquiescence in evil the true position of religion, and they  see in all they suffer an outrage inflicted on the better law of Islam.  I was much struck by hearing the Egyptian peasantry last year attribute  the lighter taxes they were then enjoying to the fact that their new  ruler was \"a man who feared God.\"    At the same time the learned classes are shocked and alarmed at the  political decline of Islam and the still greater dangers which stare her  in the face, and they attribute them to the unchecked wickedness and  corruption with which the long rule of Constantinople has pervaded every  class of society, even beyond its own territorial borders. They complain  now that they have been led astray, and believe that the vengeance of  Heaven will overtake them if they do not amend their ways. In all this,  I say, there is something of the spirit which once goaded Christians  into an examination of the bases on which their belief rested, and of  the true nature of the law which tolerated such great corruption.    Nor must we suppose that any part of this dissatisfaction is  attributable as yet to a decay of faith, such as we now witness among  ourselves. Islam as yet shows hardly a taint of infidelity. The  Mussulman of the present day, whatever his rank in life, believes with  as absolute a faith as did the Christian of the period just referred to.  With the exception of here and there a false convert or, as a very rare  case, an Europeanized infidel of the modern type, there is no such  thing as a Mohammedan sceptic, that is to say, a Moslem who does not  believe in the divine mission of Mohammed. He may neglect every duty of  his profession, be guilty of every crime, have broken every law--he may  be the worst and the most depraved of men--or, on the other hand, he may  have adopted the language and to a certain extent the tone of thought of  Europe, and, a thing far more rare, he may be even a scoffer and  blasphemer;--still I do not imagine that in his heart he any the less  firmly believes that the Koran is the book of truth, or that at the day  of judgment he shall be found with those who have escaped Jehannem  through their professed acknowledgment of God and of His apostle.    I have heard strange stories in corroboration of this from persons whom  I could not doubt, and about persons whom all the world knew. Thus, one  who was with Fuad Pasha, the most European of Ottoman diplomatists, in  his last days at Nice, assures me that his whole time was spent in a  recitation of the Koran, learning it by heart. Another, who was called  the Voltaire of Islam, performed his prayers and prostrations with  scrupulous regularity whenever he found himself in private; and a  third, equally notorious as a sceptic, died of religious mania. All,  too, who have mingled much with Mussulmans, must have been struck with  the profound resignation with which even thoughtless and irreligious men  bear the ills of life, and the fortitude with which they usually meet  their end--with the large proportion that they see of men who habitually  pray and fast, and who on occasion, at great risk and sacrifice, make  the pilgrimage, and with the general absence of profanity, and the fact  that an avowal of religion is never proffered apologetically as with us,  nor met in any society with derision. These things are, perhaps, not in  themselves evidence of belief, for hypocrites have everywhere their  reward, but the fact even of hypocrisy proves the general spirit to be  one of avowed belief.    The truly devout are doubtless rare, but where we find them it is  evident that their belief pervades their lives in as strict a sense as  it does devout persons among ourselves. It would probably be difficult  to point out in Europe men who in the world--I do not speak of  ecclesiastics or persons in religious orders--lead more transparently  religious lives than do the pious Moslems of the better class whom one  may find in almost any oriental town, or men who more closely follow  the ideal which their creed sets before them. To doubt the sincerity and  even, in a certain sense, the sanctity of such persons, would be to  doubt all religion. In any case it is notorious that the faith of Mecca  is still the living belief of a vast number of the human race, the rule  of their lives, and the explanation to them of their whole existence.  There is no sign as yet that it has ceased to be a living faith.    Neither in considering its future is it easy for a candid English mind  to escape the admission that, for all purposes of argument, the  Mohammedan creed must be treated as no vain superstition but a true  religion, true inasmuch as it is a form of the worship of that one true  God in whom Europe, in spite of her modern reason, still believes. As  such it is entitled to whatever credit we may give true religions of  prolonged vitality; and while admitting the eternal truth of  Christianity for ourselves, we may be tempted to believe that in the  Arabian mind, if in no other, Islam too will prove eternal.    In its simplest form Islam was but an emphatic renewal of the immemorial  creed of the Semites, and as long as a pure Semitic race is left in the  world, the revelation of Mecca may be expected to remain a necessary  link in their tradition. No modern arguments of science are ever likely  to affect the belief of Arabia that God has at sundry times and in  sundry places spoken to man by the mouth of his prophets; and among  these prophets Mohammed will always be the most conspicuous because the  most distinctly national. Also the law of Islam--I am not speaking  merely of the Sheriat as we now see it--will always remain their law  because it is the codification of their custom, and its political  organization their political organization because it is founded on a  practice coeval with their history.    Lastly, Semitic thought is a strong leaven which everywhere pervades the  minds of nations, aliens though they be, who have once admitted it; and  it will not easily be cast out. We have seen in Europe, even in England,  a land never brought physically into contact with Arabia, how long  Arabian thought, filtered as it was through France and Spain to our  shores, has dominated our ideas. Chivalry, a notion purely Bedouin, is  hardly yet extinct among us. Romance, the offspring of pre-Islamic  Arabia, is still a common motive of our action, and our poets express it  still, to the neglect of classic models, in the rhymed verse of Yemen.  The mass of our people still pray to the God of Abraham, and turn  eastwards towards that land which is Arabia's half-sister, the Holy Land  of the Jews.    If then we, who are mere aliens, find it impossible to escape this  subtle influence, what must it be for those races wholly or half Arabian  who have for centuries been impregnated with Islam, the quintessence of  Arabian thought? Who shall fix the term of its power, and say that it  cannot renew itself and live? \"Send forth,\" says a famous English  writer, who was also a famous English statesman, \"a great thought, as  you have done before, from Mount Sinai, from the villages of Galilee,  from the deserts of Arabia, and you may again remodel all men's  institutions, change their principles of action, and breathe a new  spirit into the scope of their existence.\"    But I must not lose myself in generalities or forget that it is for  practical Englishmen that I am writing. To be precise, I see two ways in  which it is probable that Islam will attempt to renew her spiritual  life, and two distinct lines of thought which according to external  circumstances she may be expected to follow--the first a violent and  hardly a permanent one, the second the true solution of her destiny.    Among the popular beliefs of Islam--and it is one common to every sect,  Shiite and Abadite, as well as Sunite--is this one, that in the latter  days of the world, when the power of God's worshippers shall have grown  weak and their faith corrupted, a leader shall arise who shall restore  the fortunes of the true believers. He shall begin by purging the earth  of injustice, fighting against oppressors wherever he shall find them,  Mohammedan as well as Infidel, and he shall teach the people a perfect  law which they shall have forgotten, and he shall reign over Islam in  place of their Khalifeh, being called the Mohdy, or guide. To this some  add that he will arise of a sudden in some distant corner of the earth,  and that he will march towards Mecca, and that everywhere the blood of  Moslems shall be shed like water, and that he shall enter Mecca when the  streets shall run with blood. In support of this coming of the Mohdy  many traditions exist which are held to be authentic by the Ulema. Thus  it is related on the authority of Abdallah ibn Messaoud that he heard  the Prophet say, \"When there shall remain but one day of the days of the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#19)"],[1,"commanded those who  are holier and in better favor with God than we; as, indeed, the human  heart is by nature so despondent that it always flees from God and  imagines that He does not wish or desire our prayer, because we are  sinners and have merited nothing but wrath. Against such thoughts (I  say) we should regard this commandment and turn to God, that we may not  by such disobedience excite His anger still more. For by this  commandment He gives us plainly to understand that He will not cast us  from Him nor chase us away, although we are sinners, but rather draw  us to Himself, so that we might humble ourselves before Him, bewail  this misery and plight of ours, and pray for grace and help. Therefore  we read in the Scriptures that He is angry also with those who were  smitten for their sin, because they did not return to Him and by their  prayers assuage His wrath and seek His grace.    Now, from the fact that it is so solemnly commanded to pray, you are to  conclude and think, that no one should by any means despise his prayer,  but rather set great store by it, and always seek an illustration from  the other commandments. A child should by no means despise his  obedience to father and mother, but should always think: This work is a  work of obedience, and what I do I do with no other intention than that  I may walk in the obedience and commandment of God, on which I can  settle and stand firm, and esteem it a great thing, not on account of  my worthiness, but on account of the commandment. So here also, what  and for what we pray we should regard as demanded by God and done in  obedience to Him, and should reflect thus: On my account it would  amount to nothing; but it shall avail, for the reason that God has  commanded it. Therefore everybody, no matter what he has to say in  prayer, should always come before God in obedience to this commandment.      We pray, therefore, and exhort every one most diligently to take this  to heart and by no means to despise our prayer. For hitherto it has  been taught thus in the devil's name that no one regarded these things,  and men supposed it to be sufficient to have done the work, whether God  would hear it or not. But that is staking prayer on a risk, and  murmuring it at a venture, and therefore it is a lost prayer. For we  allow such thoughts as these to lead us astray and deter us: I am not  holy or worthy enough; if I were as godly and holy as St. Peter or St.  Paul, then I would pray. But put such thoughts far away, for just the  same commandment which applied to St. Paul applies also to me; and the  Second Commandment is given as much on my account as on his account, so  that he can boast of no better or holier commandment.    Therefore you should say: My prayer is as precious, holy, and pleasing  to God as that of St. Paul or of the most holy saints. This is the  reason: For I will gladly grant that he is holier in his person, but  not on account of the commandment; since God does not regard prayer on  account of the person, but on account of His word and obedience  thereto. For on the commandment on which all the saints rest their  prayer I, too, rest mine. Moreover I pray for the same thing for which  they all pray and ever have prayed; besides, I have just as great a  need of it as those great saints, yea, even a greater one than they.    Let this be the first and most important point, that all our prayers  must be based and rest upon obedience to God, irrespective of our  person, whether we be sinners or saints, worthy or unworthy. And we  must know that God will not have it treated as a jest, but be angry,  and punish all who do not pray, as surely as He punishes all other  disobedience; next, that He will not suffer our prayers to be in vain  or lost. For if He did not intend to answer your prayer, He would not  bid you pray and add such a severe commandment to it.    In the second place, we should be the more urged and incited to pray  because God has also added a promise, and declared that it shall surely  be done to us as we pray, as He says Ps. 50, 15: Call upon Me in the  day of trouble: I will deliver thee. And Christ in the Gospel of St.  Matthew, 7, 7: Ask, and it shall be given you. For every one that  asketh receiveth. Such promises ought certainly to encourage and kindle  our hearts to pray with pleasure and delight, since He testifies with  His [own] word that our prayer is heartily pleasing to Him, moreover,  that it shall assuredly be heard and granted, in order that we may not  despise it or think lightly of it, and pray at a venture.    This you can hold up to Him and say: Here I come, dear Father, and  pray, not of my own purpose nor upon my own worthiness, but at Thy  commandment and promise, which cannot fail or deceive me. Whoever,  therefore, does not believe this promise must know again that he  excites God to anger as a person who most highly dishonors Him and  reproaches Him with falsehood.    Besides this, we should be incited and drawn to prayer because in  addition to this commandment and promise God anticipates us, and  Himself arranges the words and form of prayer for us, and places them  upon our lips as to how and what we should pray, that we may see how  heartily He pities us in our distress, and may never doubt that such  prayer is pleasing to Him and shall certainly be answered; which [the  Lord's Prayer] is a great advantage indeed over all other prayers that  we might compose ourselves. For in them the conscience would ever be in  doubt and say: I have prayed, but who knows how it pleases Him, or  whether I have hit upon the right proportions and form? Hence there is  no nobler prayer to be found upon earth than the Lord's Prayer which we  daily pray because it has this excellent testimony, that God loves to  hear it, which we ought not to surrender for all the riches of the  world.    And it has been prescribed also for this reason that we should see and  consider the distress which ought to urge and compel us to pray without  ceasing. For whoever would pray must have something to present, state,  and name which he desires; if not, it cannot be called a prayer.    Therefore we have rightly rejected the prayers of monks and priests,  who howl and growl day and night like fiends; but none of them think of  praying for a hair's breadth of anything. And if we would assemble all  the churches, together with all ecclesiastics, they would be obliged to  confess that they have never from the heart prayed for even a drop of  wine. For none of them has ever purposed to pray from obedience to God  and faith in His promise, nor has any one regarded any distress, but  (when they had done their best) they thought no further than this, to  do a good work, whereby they might repay God, as being unwilling to  take anything from Him, but wishing only to give Him something.    But where there is to be a true prayer there must be earnestness. Men  must feel their distress, and such distress as presses them and compels  them to call and cry out then prayer will be made spontaneously, as it  ought to be, and men will require no teaching how to prepare for it and  to attain to the proper devotion. But the distress which ought to  concern us most, both as regards ourselves and every one, you will find  abundantly set forth in the Lord's Prayer. Therefore it is to serve  also to remind us of the same, that we contemplate it and lay it to  heart, lest we become remiss in prayer. For we all have enough that we  lack, but the great want is that we do not feel nor see it. Therefore  God also requires that you lament and plead such necessities and wants,  not because He does not know them, but that you may kindle your heart  to stronger and greater desires, and make wide and open your cloak to  receive much.    Therefore, every one of us should accustom himself from his youth  daily to pray for all his wants, whenever he is sensible of anything  affecting his interests or that of other people among whom he may live,  as for preachers, the government, neighbors, domestics, and always (as  we have said) to hold up to God His commandment and promise, knowing  that He will not have them disregarded. This I say because I would like  to see these things brought home again to the people that they might  learn to pray truly, and not go about coldly and indifferently, whereby  they become daily more unfit for prayer; which is just what the devil  desires, and for what he works with all his powers. For he is well  aware what damage and harm it does him when prayer is in proper  practice. For this we must know, that all our shelter and protection  rest in prayer alone. For we are far too feeble to cope with the devil  and all his power and adherents that set themselves against us, and  they might easily crush us under their feet. Therefore we must consider  and take up those weapons with which Christians must be armed in order  to stand against the devil. For what do you think has hitherto  accomplished such great things, has checked or quelled the counsels,  purposes, murder, and riot of our enemies, whereby the devil thought to  crush us, together with the Gospel, except that the prayer of a few  godly men intervened like a wall of iron on our side? They should else  have witnessed a far different tragedy, namely, how the devil would  have destroyed all Germany in its own blood. But now they may  confidently deride it and make a mock of it, however, we shall  nevertheless be a match both for themselves and the devil by prayer  alone, if we only persevere diligently and not become slack. For  whenever a godly Christian prays: Dear Father let Thy will be done, God  speaks from on high and says: Yes, dear child, it shall be so, in spite  of the devil and all the world.    Let this be said as an exhortation, that men may learn, first of all,  to esteem prayer as something great and precious, and to make a proper  distinction between babbling and "]]]
