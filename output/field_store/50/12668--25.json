XI--John Turnbull, college professor; one of the new type, alert,  observant and extremely precise. Not apt to make a misstatement.    XII--James Hunter, door-man, a little old for his work, but straight as  a string and methodical to a fault. No wife, no child. Bank account more  than sufficient for his small wants.

A widower with two grandchildren--a daughter  married to an Englishman and living in Ringold, Hants, and a son, owner  of a large ranch in California. Lives, when in city, at Hotel Gorham.  Known too well for any description of himself or character to be  necessary here. If he has a fault, or rather a weakness, it is his  extreme pride in the museum and his own conduct of its many affairs.    As on the evening before, Mr. Gryce lingered longest over one name. He  was still brooding anxiously over it when the telephone rang at his  elbow and he was called up from Headquarters. Cablegrams had been  received from London and Paris in acknowledgment of those sent, and in  both these cablegrams promises were made of a full examination into the  antecedents of Madame Duclos and her companion, Miss Willetts.    That was all. No further news regarding them from any quarter. Mr. Gryce  hung up the receiver with a sigh.    \"It is likely to be a long road full of unexpected turns and perilously  near the precipice's edge,\" he muttered in weary comment to himself.  \"Nothing to start from but----\"    Here Sweetwater walked in.    Mr. Gryce showed surprise. He had not expected to see the young man  himself. Perhaps he was not quite ready to, for he seemed to shrink, for  one brief instant, as from an unwelcome presence.    But the cheer which always entered with Sweetwater was contagious,  and the old detective smiled as the newcomer approached, saying  significantly:    \"I had those dreams you spoke of last night, Mr. Gryce, and found them  too weighty for the telephone.\"    \"I see, I see! Sit down, Sweetwater, and tell me how they ran. I haven't  as much confidence in my own dreams as I hope to have in yours. Speak  up! Mention names, if you want to. No echo follows confidences uttered in  this room.\"    \"I know that; but for the present perhaps it will be best for me to  follow your lead, and when I have to speak of a certain person, say X as  you do. X, Mr. Gryce, is the man who for reasons we do not yet understand  brought up the discarded bow from the cellar and stored it somewhere  within reach on the floor above. X is also the man who for the same  unknown reason robbed the quiver hanging in the southern gallery of one  of its arrows and kept the same on hand or in hiding, till he could mate  it with the bow. My dreams showed me this picture:    \"A man with a predominating interest in sport, but otherwise active in  business, correct in his dealings and respectable in private life, sees  and frequently handles weapons of ancient and modern make which rouse his  interest and awaken the longing, common to such men, to test his skill in  their use. Sometimes it is a sword, which he twirls vigorously in sly  corners. Again, it is a bow calling for a yeoman's strength to pull. He  is a man of sense and for a long time goes no further than the play I  have just indicated. Perhaps he has no temptation to go further until one  unfortunate day he comes upon an idle bow, rotting away in the cellar.\"    Here Mr. Gryce looked sharply up--a proof of awakened interest which  Sweetwater did not heed. Possibly he was not expected to. At all events  he continued rapidly:    \"It was a fine, strong bow, a typical one from the plains. He took it  up--examined it closely--noted a slight defect in it somewhere--and put  it back. But he did not forget it. Before many days had passed, he goes  down cellar again and brings it up and stands it on end in--where do you  think, sir?--in the closet of the Curator's office!\"    \"How did you learn that?\"    \"From the woman who comes every day to wipe up the floors. I happened to  think she might have something worth while to tell us, so I hunted her  up----\"    \"Go on, boy. Another long mark in your favor.\"    \"Thank you, sir. I'm relating a dream, you know. He stands it on end then  in this closet into which nobody is supposed to go but the Curator _and_  the scrubwoman, and there he leaves it, possibly as yet with no definite  intention. How long it stood there I cannot say. It was well hidden, it  seems, by something or other hanging over it. Nor am I altogether sure  that it might not be standing there yet if the impulse swaying X had not  been strengthened by seeing daily over his head a quiver full of arrows  admirably fitted for this bow. Time has no place in dreams, or I might be  able to state the day and the hour when he stood looking at the ring of  keys lying on the Curator's desk, and struck with what it might do for  him, singled out one of the keys which he placed in the keyhole of a door  opening upon a certain little iron staircase. He was alone, but he  stopped to listen before turning that key. I can see him, can't you? His  air is a guilty one; but it is the guilt of folly, not of premeditated  crime. He wants a try at that bow and recognizes his weakness and laughs.    \"But his longing holds, and running up the little staircase to a second  door, he unlocks this also and after another moment of hesitation pulls  it open. He has brought the bow with him, but he does not take it past  the drapery hanging straight down before his eyes. He simply drops it in  the doorway and leaves it there within easy reach from the gallery if  ever his impulse should be strong enough to lead him to make an attempt  at striking a feather from the Indian headdress on the other side of the  court. You think him mad. So do I, but dreams are filled with that kind  of madness; and when I see him shut the door upon this bow, and steal  back without relocking it or the one below, I have no other excuse than  this to give in answer to your criticisms.\"    \"I do not criticise; I listen, Sweetwater.\"    \"You will criticise now. As Bunyan says in his 'Pilgrim's Progress': 'I  dreamed again!' This time I saw the museum proper. It was filled with  visitors. The morning of May twenty-second was a busy one, I am told, and  a whole lot of people, singly and in groups, were continually passing up  and down the marble steps and along the two galleries. Partaking of the  feelings of the one whose odd impulses I am endeavoring to describe, I  was very uneasy and very restless until these crowds had thinned and most  of the guests vanished from the building. The hands of the clock were  stealing toward twelve--the hour of greatest quiet and fewest visitors.  As it reached the quarter mark, I saw what I was looking for, the man X  reaching for one of those arrows hanging in the southern gallery, and  slipping it inside his coat.--Did you speak, sir?\"    No, Mr. Gryce had not spoken; and Sweetwater, after an interval of  uncertainty, went quietly on:    \"As I saw both of his hands quite free the next minute, I judge that  something had been attached to the lining of that coat to hold the arrow  by its feathered head. But this is a deduction rather than a fact.\"    He stopped abruptly. An exclamation--one of Mr. Gryce's very own--had  left that gentleman's lips, and Sweetwater felt that he must pause if  only for an instant, to enjoy his small triumph. But the delay was short.    \"Go on,\" said Mr. Gryce; and Sweetwater obeyed, but in lowered tones as  though the vision he was describing was actually before his eyes.    \"Next, I see a sweep of tapestry, and an eager, peering figure passing  slowly across it. It is that of the love-lorn Travis watching his  inamorata tripping up the marble staircase and turning at its top in the  direction of the opposite gallery. His is a timid soul, and anxious as he  is to watch her, he is not at all anxious to be detected in the act of  doing so. So he slips behind the huge pedestal towering near him, thus  causing the whole gallery to appear empty to the eyes of X, now entering  it at the other end. This latter has come there with but one idea in his  head--to shoot an arrow across the court at the mark I have mentioned. It  may have been on a dare--sometimes I think it was; but shoot it he means  to, before a fresh crowd "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#19)"],[1,"give up your lessons for the  morning, and get home. It is blowing a gale now, and we shall probably  have the rain down before long. I will walk down with you. The wind is  dead on the shore, and it will be a grand sight.\"    Aggie at once set her mind on going, too; but the squire refused, until  Mrs. Walsham suggested that, if it came on wet, Aggie could stop at her  house until it cleared up, or, if necessary, till morning. Whereupon,  the squire had given way, and the three had started together for  Sidmouth, leaving Mrs. Walsham at her house as they passed. The others  had struggled down, against the wind, until they came within sight of  the sea. The first boat had just been run safely on shore when they  arrived, and Aggie gave a cry, and put her hands over her face, as the  second boat was seen to capsize.    \"Cling to me, Aggie,\" the squire said. \"See, they are rushing in the  water to save them. They will have them, yet!\"    At the cheer which broke out from the spectators, clustering thickly  now, as the first of the shipwrecked crew was brought to shore, Aggie  looked out again. It was a sight she never forgot. With the great waves  crashing down on the shore, and the line of straggling figures, waist  deep in the white foam, in which were scattered, here and there,  portions of the boat, oars, sails, and nets.    \"Well done, well done!\" the squire exclaimed. \"They have dragged up  three of them. I don't know whether there are any more.\"    \"Yes, yes, look!\" Aggie cried; \"there, out in the waves--there, I can  see a head. That's just about where I was nearly drowned. Oh,  grandpapa, take me away, I can't look at it.\"    \"There's someone going out to save him, Aggie. Listen to the cheer.\"    Aggie looked again.    \"Oh, grandpapa, stop him, stop him!\" she cried, \"it's James.\"    But at the same moment the plunge was made, and the figure lost to  sight.    Aggie threw her arms round her grandfather, and hid her face.    \"I can't look, I can't look,\" she cried. \"Tell me about it.\"    \"There, he is up; bravo!\" the squire exclaimed, almost as excited as  she was. \"He has dived again, dear,\"--then, after a pause--\"there he is  close to him. He has got him, Aggie! Now he is waving his hand; now  they are tightening the rope; now he is waving his hand again, and they  are waiting. There!\"    There was a pause, which seemed to the girl to be endless, then the  squire cried:    \"They have got them out, both of them;\" and a loud cheer broke from all  standing round.    \"Come along, grandpapa, let us go down to them.\"    \"Stay a moment, my dear. They may be hurt. It's better you should not  go.\"    The girl stood, with her hands clasped, gazing at the fishermen grouped  on the shore, stooping over the prostrate figures. Then one of them  stood up and waved his hand, and the spectators knew that all was well.  Then the girl ran down to join them.    \"Why, Aggie!\" James exclaimed in astonishment, as she pressed forward.  \"Why, my dear, what brings you here in this storm? Whatever will the  squire say?\"    \"The squire has brought her down himself,\" Mr. Linthorne said,  following closely behind his granddaughter; \"and he is glad he did,  James, for she has seen a grand sight.    \"You are a fine fellow;\" and he wrung the lad's hand.    \"A grand fellow, Wilks, isn't he?\"    \"I always said so, squire,\" the old soldier said, his face beaming with  satisfaction; \"but now, let us get him home, and Aggie, too. The child  will be blown away.\"    But, for a minute or two, they could not carry James off, so closely  did the men and women press round him, and shake him by the hand. At  last they got him away, and, escorted by a crowd of cheering boys, led  him back to his mother's.    \"Your son is a hero, Mrs. Walsham!\" the squire exclaimed as they  entered; \"but don't talk to him now, but mix him a glass of hot grog.    \"Wilks, you get him between the blankets directly. I will tell his  mother all about it, while she is mixing the grog.    \"Hallo, Aggie! Why, bless the child, she's fainted.\"    The girl had borne up till they reached the house, towards which the  wind had blown her along, as she clung to her grandfather's arm; but  the excitement had been too much for her, and, the instant they entered  the room, she had dropped into an armchair, and at once lost  consciousness.    Mrs. Walsham kept her presence of mind, in spite of her bewilderment at  these sudden occurrences. She at once laid the girl on the sofa,  removed her dripping bonnet and cloak, and poured a few drops of brandy  between her lips, while she set the squire to work, to chafe her hands.  Aggie soon opened her eyes, and recovered her consciousness.    \"Don't try to get up, Aggie,\" Mrs. Walsham said. \"You are faint and  shaken with all this excitement. Your grandpapa and I were two very  foolish people, to let you come out.    \"Now, Mr. Wilks, the best thing you can do, is to find a boy outside,  and send him up to the Hall, with a message that the carriage is to  come down directly.    \"I think, Mr. Linthorne, she had better get back home. I should be glad  enough, as you know, to keep her here for the night; but this house is  rocking with the wind, now, and she would not be likely to get any  sleep here. I will run up and see how James is, and if he is all right,  I will come up with her and stop the night. She is very much shaken,  and had better not be alone.\"    Mrs. Walsham soon came downstairs again, and said that James said he  never felt better in his life, and that, by all means, she was to go up  to the Hall. She then set about and prepared a cup of tea, which  greatly restored Aggie, and, by the time the carriage arrived, the girl  was able to walk to the gate.    Mr. Wilks had offered to remain with James, but the latter would not  hear of it. The lad was, indeed, well pleased to hear that they were  all going up to the Hall, as thereby he escaped hearing any more of his  own praises. Besides, he was most anxious to get down to the beach  again, for no one could say what might take place there before morning.    As soon, therefore, as he heard the door close, he jumped out of bed,  and when, peeping through the blinds, he saw the carriage drive off  with its four occupants, he at once began to dress. He felt bruised and  sore from the blows he had received, and a red wheal round his chest,  beneath the arms, showed where the rope had almost cut into the flesh.  However, he soon dressed himself, and descended the stairs, went into  the kitchen, and told the astonished girl that he was going out; then,  having made a hasty meal of bread and cold meat, he put on his oilskins  again, and started for the shore.    He did not, however, wait long. So heavy was the sea, now, that nothing  whatever could be done should any vessel drive ashore, and, as for the  fisher boats, the sailors shook their heads as they spoke of them.    \"They were farther away to the west, so the chaps as got ashore tells  us. They may have got in, somewhere, before it got to the worst. If  not, it must have gone hard with them.\"    Finding that there was nothing to be done, and that he was much more  stiff and bruised than he had believed, Jim made his way back again,  and turned into bed; where he soon fell asleep, and did not wake until  the following morning.    One of the grooms had come down from the Hall, at six o'clock, to  inquire how he was, and the message given by the girl, that he had been  out, but that he had come back and was now sound asleep, satisfied Mrs.  Walsham, and enabled her to devote her undivided attention to her  charge, who needed her care more than her son. Before night, indeed,  the squire had sent down to Sidmouth for Dr. Walsham's successor, who  said that Aggie was very feverish, and must be kept perfectly quiet for  some days. He sent her up a soothing draught, and Mrs. Walsham sat up  with her all night. She slept but little, and talked almost  incessantly, sometimes rambling a little.    The first thing in the morning, the doctor was again sent for, and on  his recommendation the squire at once sent off a man, on horseback, to  Exeter, for the leading physician of that town. When he arrived, late  in the afternoon, Aggie was somewhat quieter, and his report was more  cheering.    \"Her pulse is very high,\" he said; \"but Mr. Langford tells me that it  is not so rapid as it was in the morning, and that he thinks the  symptoms are abating. Undoubtedly, it is a sharp feverish attack,  brought on by excitement and exposure. A very little more, and it would  have been a case of brain fever, but I trust now that it will soon pass  off. The sedatives that have been administered are taking effect, and I  trust she will soon fall asleep.    \"As you requested, I have made my arrangements for staying here  tonight, and I trust that, by the morning, we shall have her  convalescent.\"    Mr. Wilks had gone down, the first thing in the morning, to see James,  and found him up and about as usual. He was very greatly concerned, at  hearing that Aggie had passed a bad night, and came four times up to  the Hall, during the day, to inquire about her; and on his last visit,  late in the evening, he was told that she was sleeping quietly, and  that the doctor had every hope that she would wake, in the morning,  free from fever. This proved to be the case; but she was ordered to  keep her bed for a day or two.    On the morning after the storm, the wind had gone down much, although a  tremendous sea was still breaking on the shore. Messages arrived, in  the course of the day, to say that all the missing boats, with one  exception, had succeeded in gaining the shore before the storm was full  on. The missing boat was never heard of again.    Two days later, James Walsham had strolled up the hill to the east of  the town, and was lying, with a book before him, in a favourite nook of  his looking over the sea. It was one of the lovely days which sometimes"]]]
