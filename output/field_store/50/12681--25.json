The two following tales are typical of those commonly heard in a Bagobo  gathering. The first was told by Urbano Eli, a Bagobo of Malilla.    \"After the people were created a man named LumabEt was born. He could  talk when he was one day old and the people said he was sent by Manama.  He lived ninety seasons and when still a young man he had a hunting dog  which he took to hunt on the mountain. The dog started up a white deer  and LumabEt and his companions followed until they had gone about the  world nine times when they finally caught it. At the time they caught  the deer LumabEt's hair was grey and he was an old man. All the time he  was gone he had only one banana and one camote with him for food. When  night came he planted the skin of the banana and in the morning he had  ripe bananas to eat, and the camotes came the same way. When he had  caught the deer LumabEt called the people to see him and he told them to  kill his father. They obeyed him and then LumabEt took off his headband  and waved it in the air over the dead man, and he at once was alive  again. He did this eight times and at the eighth time his father was  small like a little boy, for every time the people cut him in two the  knife took off a little flesh. So all the people thought LumabEt was  like a god.    \"One year after he killed the deer he told all the people to come into  his house, but they said they could not, for the house was small and the  people many. But LumabEt said there was plenty of room, so all entered  his house and were not crowded. The next morning the _diwata_,  _tigyama_, and other spirits came and talked with him. After that he  told the people that all who believed that he was powerful could go with  him, but all who did not go would be turned into animals and _buso_.  Then LumabEt started away and those who stayed back became animals and  _buso_.    \"He went to the place Binaton, across the ocean, the place where the  earth and sky meet. When he got there he saw that the sky kept going up  and down the same as a man opening and closing his jaws. LumabEt said to  the sky 'You must go up,' but the sky replied 'No.' At last LumabEt  promised the sky that if he let the others go he might catch the last  one who tried to pass; so the sky opened and the people went through;  but when near to the last the sky shut down and caught the bolo of next  to the last man. The last one he caught and ate.    \"That day LumabEt's son Tagalion was hunting and caught many animals  which he hung up. Then he said he must go to his father's place; so he  leaned an arrow against a _baliti_ tree and sat on it. It began to grow  down and carried him down to his father's place, but when he arrived  there were no people there. He saw a gun, made out of gold, and some  white bees in the house. The bees said 'You must not cry; we can take  you to the sky,' So he rode on the gun, and the bees took him to the sky  and he arrived there in three days.    \"One of the men was looking down on the land below, and all of the  spirits made fun of him and said they would take out his intestines so  that he would be like one of them and never die. The man refused to let  them, and he wanted to go back home because he was afraid; so Manama  said to let him go.    \"The spirits took leaves of the _karan_ grass and tied to his legs, and  made a chain of the grass and let him down to the earth. When he reached  the earth he was no longer a man but was an owl.\"    (2) The second tale, which was recorded by P. Juan Doyle, S. J., is as  follows:    \"In one of the torrents which has its origin at the foot of Apo, there  were two eels which, having acquired extraordinary magnitude, had no  room in so little water, on account of which they determined to  separate, each one taking a different direction in search of the sea or  the great lakes. One arrived, happily, at the sea by the Padada river,  and from it came eels in the sea. The other descending a torrent,  swimming and confining himself as well as he might, enclosed in these  narrow places, said to himself 'I haven't the slightest idea of what the  sea is, but it appears to me that when I see before me an extraordinary  clearness on a limpid surface, that must be the sea, and with one spring  I will jump into it.' So saying, he arrived at a point where the torrent  formed a cascade. He noticed that it cut off the horizon and to his view  it appeared of an extraordinary clearness; he thought he could swim  there without limit, and at his pleasure, and that this, in fine, must  be the sea. He darted into it, but the unhappy one was dashed against  the rocks, and too fatigued to swim through the rough waters, he lost  his life. His body lay there inert and formed undulations which are now  the folds which the earth forms to the left of Mt. Apo.\"    OTHER BRANCHES OF THE TRIBE.    To the south and southwest of Mt. Apo, and west of Digos, are seven  settlements, the inhabitants of which are known as Obo or Tigdapaya. On  the south they meet the Bila-an, and, like this latter people, extend  over the watershed into the valley of the Cotabato river. On the  northwest they come in contact with the Ata. They have intermarried with  both of these tribes, have adopted many of their customs, and in some  cases their manner of dress. However, they consider themselves, and are  considered by the Bagobo, as a part of that tribe, and recognize  Tongkaling as their chief. Bagobo customs and blood predominate,  although intermarriage with the Negrito was evident in nearly every  individual of this division seen by the writer.    Immediately wrest of Daliao are three villages whose people are known as  Eto or Ata. Aside from a slightly greater percentage of individuals  showing negroid features, these people do not differ in any respect from  the Bagobo. It does not seem that they should be classed with the people  later referred to as Ata. To the north, their lands join the territory  held by the Guianga.    The habitat of the division called Guianga begins a few miles back of  the Gulf and extends west to the watershed. An east and west line drawn  through the village of Taloma marks their southern boundary, while to  the north they approach the Lasan river. They are found in a number of  scattered settlements which owe allegiance and are subject to five petty  _datu_. Tongkaling is not recognized as having any authority in the  district, and there seems to be no remembrance of a time when any of the  Bagobo rulers held authority over the Guianga. Physically and culturally  they do not seem to be far removed from the Bagobo, while their language  is so closely related that individuals of the two divisions, meeting for  the first time can carry on a conversation. There is, however,  considerable variation between the dialects, both in intonation and  vocabulary.    Further study may result in raising this branch to the dignity of a  tribe, but the information at hand does not justify us in considering  them other than a dialect group of the Bagobo.        II. BILA-AN.    SYNONYMS.    (a) TAGALAGAD--\"dwellers in the back country\" is the name generally  applied to this tribe by the coast natives.    (b) TAGKOGON--\"dwellers in the cogon\"--The group living on the grass  plains west of Malalag.    (c) BULUAN, BULUANES--The members of this tribe dwelling near to Lake  Buluan. This group is sometimes identified with the Tagabili or Tagabulu  who also reside in that region.    (d) BIRA-AN, BARA-AN--Synonym for BILA-AN, often used by the neighboring  Bagobo.    (e) VILANES, BILANES.    (f) BALUD or TUMANAO--name sometimes applied by early writers to the  Bila-an who live on the Sarangani Islands.    This tribe is found in the mountains on the west side of Davao Gulf  beginning at an east and west line drawn through Bulatakay and extending  south to Sarangani Point, and they also appear in small numbers in the  Sarangani Islands which lie just south of the mainland. At Bulatakay  they are a day's march back from the coast and to reach them it is  necessary to pass for several hours through a rolling belt of forest  land, then as the mountains are approached, gently sloping cogon plains  about ten miles in width are crossed. West of Malalag they are still far  from the sea with a belt of hill Tagakaolo between them and the coast  people. In this region they have spread out in considerable numbers on  to the grass plains, and for this reason are locally known as Tagkogon  \"dwellers in the cogon.\" On the gulf side of the divide, south of  Malalag, they are found in small groups far back in the mountains, while  between them and the sea are Tagakaolo, Kulaman and Moro. Along the  watershed between the districts of Davao and Cotabato they possess all  the territory and even extend in some numbers into the lowlands toward  Lake Buluan. They are distinctly a mountain people, having never reached  the sea, except near Sarangani Point, until after the advent of the  American. Since then a few hundred have been induced to move to the  coast plantations, and the town of Labau has been established on the  Padada river about six miles back of the coast. According to Mr. H. S.  Wilson, tribal ward headman for the Bila-an, this tribe numbers about  ten thousand persons, of which number fifteen hundred reside on the  Sarangani Islands.    The material here presented was gathered from the people of Labau, the  Malalag cogon, and those living near the headwaters of the Ma-al and  Padada rivers.    Formerly a neutral, uninhabited belt extended between them and the coast  people, and at stated intervals they went to recognized trading points  in this territory to exchange their agricultural and forest products for  salt, fish, and other articles of barter. Beyond this trading and an  occasional fight, they had few dealings with the coast people and seem  never to have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#19)"],[1,"not such another gem as the nest of the humming-bird.  The finding of one is an event to date from. It is the next best thing  to finding an eagle's nest. I have met with but two, both by chance.  One was placed on the horizontal branch of a chestnut-tree, with a  solitary green leaf, forming a complete canopy, about an inch and a  half above it. The repeated spiteful dartings of the bird past my  ears, as I stood under the tree, caused me to suspect that I was  intruding upon some one's privacy; and following it with my eye, I  soon saw the nest, which was in process of construction. Adopting my  usual tactics of secreting myself near by, I had the satisfaction of  seeing the tiny artist at work. It was the female, unassisted by her  mate. At intervals of two or three minutes she would appear with a  small tuft of some cottony substance in her beak, dart a few times  through and around the tree, and alighting quickly in the nest arrange  the material she had brought, using her breast as a model.    The other nest I discovered in a dense forest on the side of a  mountain. The sitting bird was disturbed as I passed beneath her. The  whirring of her wings arrested my attention, when, after a short  pause, I had the good luck to see, through an opening in the leaves,  the bird return to her nest, which appeared like a mere wart or  excrescence on a small branch. The humming-bird, unlike all others,  does not alight upon the nest, but flies into it. She enters it as  quick as a flash, but as light as any feather. Two eggs are the  complement. They are perfectly white, and so frail that only a woman's  fingers may touch them. Incubation lasts about ten days. In a week the  young have flown.    The only nest like the humming-bird's, and comparable to it in  neatness and symmetry, is that of the blue-gray gnat-catcher. This is  often saddled upon the limb in the same manner, though it is generally  more or less pendent; it is deep and soft, composed mostly of some  vegetable down, covered all over with delicate tree-lichens, and,  except that it is much larger, appears almost identical with the nest  of the humming-bird.    But the nest of nests, the ideal nest, after we have left the deep  woods, is unquestionably that of the Baltimore oriole. It is the only  perfectly pensile nest we have. The nest of the orchard oriole is  indeed mainly so, but this bird generally builds lower and shallower,  more after the manner of the vireos.    The Baltimore oriole loves to attach its nest to the swaying branches  of the tallest elms, making no attempt at concealment, but satisfied  if the position be high and the branch pendent. This nest would seem  to cost more time and skill than any other bird structure. A peculiar  flax-like substance seems to be always sought after, and always  found. The nest when completed assumes the form of a large, suspended  gourd. The walls are thin but firm, and proof against the most driving  rain. The mouth is hemmed or over-handed with horse-hair, and the  sides are usually sewed through and through with the same.    Not particular as to the matter of secrecy, the bird is not particular  as to material, so that it be of the nature of strings or threads. A  lady friend once told me that while working by an open window, one of  these birds approached during her momentary absence, and, seizing a  skein of some kind of thread or yarn, made off with it to its  half-finished nest. But the perverse yarn caught fast in the branches,  and, in the bird's efforts to extricate it, got hopelessly tangled.  She tugged away at it all day, but was finally obliged to content  herself with a few detached portions. The fluttering strings were an  eye-sore to her ever after, and passing and repassing, she would give  them a spiteful jerk, as much as to say, \"There is that confounded  yarn that gave me so much trouble.\"    From Pennsylvania, Vincent Barnard (to whom I am indebted for other  curious facts) sent me this interesting story of an oriole. He says a  friend of his, curious in such things, on observing the bird beginning  to build, hung out near the prospective nest skeins of many-colored  zephyr-yarn, which the eager artist readily appropriated. He managed  it so that the bird used nearly equal quantities of various high,  bright colors. The nest was made unusually deep and capacious, and it  may be questioned if such a thing of beauty was ever before woven by  the cunning of a bird.    Nuttall, by far the most genial of American ornithologists, relates  the following:--    \"A female (oriole), which I observed attentively, carried off to her  nest a piece of lamp-wick ten or twelve feet long. This long string  and many other shorter ones were left hanging out for about a week  before both the ends were wattled into the sides of the nest. Some  other little birds making use of similar materials, at times twitched  these flowing ends, and generally brought out the busy Baltimore from  her occupation in great anger.    \"I may perhaps claim indulgence for adding a little more of the  biography of this particular bird, as a representative, also, of  the instincts of her race. She completed the nest in about a week's  time, without any aid from her mate, who, indeed, appeared but seldom  in her company, and was now become nearly silent. For fibrous  materials she broke, hackled, and gathered the flax of the _asclepias_  and _hibiscus_ stalks, tearing off long strings and flying with them  to the scene of her labors. She appeared very eager and hasty in her  pursuits, and collected her materials without fear or restraint, while  three men were working in the neighboring walks, and many persons  visiting the garden. Her courage and perseverance were indeed truly  admirable. If watched too narrowly, she saluted with her usual  scolding, _tshrr, tshrr, tshrr_, seeing no reason, probably, why she  should be interrupted in her indispensable occupation.    \"Though the males were now comparatively silent on the arrival of  their busy mates, I could not help observing this female and a second,  continually vociferating apparently in strife. At last she was  observed to attack this second female very fiercely, who slyly  intruded herself at times into the same tree where she was building.  These contests were angry and often repeated. To account for this  animosity, I now recollected that two fine males had been killed in  our vicinity; and I therefore concluded the intruder to be left  without a mate; yet she had gained the affections of the consort of  the busy female, and thus the cause of their jealous quarrel became  apparent. Having obtained the confidence of her faithless paramour,  the second female began preparing to weave a nest in an adjoining elm,  by tying together certain pendent twigs as a foundation. The male now  associated chiefly with the intruder, whom he even assisted in her  labor, yet did not wholly forget his first partner, who called on him  one evening in a low, affectionate tone, which was answered in the  same strain. While they were thus engaged in friendly whispers,  suddenly appeared the rival, and a violent _rencontre_ ensued, so that  one of the females appeared to be greatly agitated, and fluttered with  spreading wings as if considerably hurt. The male, though prudently  neutral in the contest, showed his culpable partiality by flying off  with his paramour, and for the rest of the evening left the tree to  his pugnacious consort. Cares of another kind, more imperious and  tender, at length reconciled, or at least terminated, these disputes  with the jealous females; and by the aid of the neighboring bachelors,  who are never wanting among these and other birds, peace was at length  completely restored, by the restitution of the quiet and happy  condition of monogamy.\"    Let me not forget to mention the nest under the mountain ledge, the  nest of the common pewee, a modest mossy structure, with four  pearl-white eggs, looking out upon some wild scene and overhung by  beetling crags. After all has been said about the elaborate, high-hung  structures, few nests, perhaps, awaken more pleasant emotions in the  mind of the beholder than this of the pewee,--the gray, silent rocks,  with caverns and dens where the fox and the wolf lurk, and just out of  their reach, in a little niche, as if it grew there, the mossy  tenement!    Nearly every high projecting rock in my range has one of these nests.  Following a trout stream up a wild mountain gorge, not long since, I  counted five in the distance of a mile, all within easy reach, but  safe from the minks and the skunks, and well housed from the storms.  In my native town I know a pine and oak clad hill, round-topped, with  a bold, precipitous front extending half-way around it. Near the top,  and along this front or side, there crops out a ledge of rocks  unusually high and cavernous. One immense layer projects many feet,  allowing a person or many persons, standing upright, to move freely  beneath it. There is a delicious spring of water there, and plenty of  wild, cool air. The floor is of loose stone, now trod by sheep and  foxes, once by the Indian and the wolf. How I have delighted from  boyhood to spend a summer-day in this retreat or take refuge there  from a sudden shower! Always the freshness and coolness, and always  the delicate mossy nest of the phoebe-bird! The bird keeps her place  till you are within a few feet of her, when she flits to a near  branch, and, with many oscillations of her tail, observes you  anxiously. Since the country has become settled, this pewee has fallen  into the strange practice of occasionally placing its nest under a  bridge, hay-shed, or other artificial structure, where it is subject  to all kinds of interruptions and annoyances. When placed thus, the  nest is larger and coarser. I know a hayloft beneath which a pair has  regularly placed its nest for several successive seasons. Arranged  along"]]]
