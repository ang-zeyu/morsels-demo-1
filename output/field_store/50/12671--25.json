'He held his head very high, for he came of a royal stock! He knew more  than the mere chasing of a stag, or the emptying of a flagon; he knew  how to manage his affairs, he said himself.    'His lady wife walked proudly across the brightly polished floors, in  her gold brocaded kirtle; the tapestries in the rooms were gorgeous, and  the furniture of costly carved woods. She had brought much gold and  silver plate into the house with her, and the cellars were full of  German ale, when there was anything there at all. Fiery black horses  neighed in the stables; Borreby Hall was a very rich place when wealth  came there.    'Then there were the children, three dainty maidens, Ida, Johanna and  Anna Dorothea. I remember their names well.    'They were rich and aristocratic people, and they were born and bred in  wealth! Whew!--whew!--fare away!' roared the wind, then he went on with  his story.    'I did not see here, as in other old noble castles the highborn lady  sitting among her maidens in the great hall turning the spinning-wheel.  No, she played upon the ringing lute, and sang to its tones. Her songs  were not always the old Danish ditties, however, but songs in foreign  tongues. All was life and hospitality; noble guests came from far and  wide; there were sounds of music and the clanging of flagons, so loud  that I could not drown them!' said the wind. 'Here were arrogance and  ostentation enough and to spare; plenty of lords, but the Lord had no  place there.    'Then came the evening of May-day!' said the wind. 'I came from the  west; I had been watching ships being wrecked and broken up on the west  coast of Jutland. I tore over the heaths and the green wooded coasts,  across the island of Funen and over the Great Belt puffing and blowing.  I settled down to rest on the coast of Zealand close to Borreby Hall,  where the splendid forest of oaks still stood. The young bachelors of  the neighbourhood came out and collected faggots and branches, the  longest and driest they could find. These they took to the town, piled  them up in a heap, and set fire to them; then the men and maidens danced  and sang round the bonfire. I lay still,' said the wind, 'but I softly  moved a branch, the one laid by the handsomest young man, and his billet  blazed up highest of all. He was the chosen one, he had the name of  honour, he became 'Buck of the Street!' and he chose from among the  girls his little May-lamb. All was life and merriment, greater far than  within rich Borreby Hall.    'The great lady came driving towards the Hall, in her gilded chariot  drawn by six horses. She had her three dainty daughters with her; they  were indeed three lovely flowers. A rose, a lily and a pale hyacinth.  The mother herself was a gorgeous tulip; she took no notice whatever of  the crowd, who all stopped in their game to drop their curtsies and make  their bows; one might have thought that, like a tulip, she was rather  frail in the stalk and feared to bend her back. The rose, the lily, and  the pale hyacinth--yes, I saw them all three. Whose May-lambs were they  one day to become, thought I; their mates would be proud  knights--perhaps even princes!    'Whew!--whew!--fare away! Yes, the chariot bore them away, and the  peasants whirled on in their dance. They played at \"Riding the Summer  into the village,\" to Borreby village, Tareby village, and many others.    'But that night when I rose,' said the wind, 'the noble lady laid  herself down to rise no more; that came to her which comes to every  one--there was nothing new about it. Waldemar Daa stood grave and silent  for a time; \"The proudest tree may bend, but it does not break,\" said  something within him. The daughters wept, and every one else at the  Castle was wiping their eyes; but Madam Daa had fared away, and I fared  away too! Whew!--whew!' said the wind.    [Illustration: _She played upon the ringing lute, and sang to its  tones._]    'I came back again; I often came back across the island of Funen and  the waters of the Belt, and took up my place on Borreby shore close to  the great forest of oaks. The ospreys and the wood pigeons used to build  in it, the blue raven and even the black stork! It was early in the  year; some of the nests were full of eggs, while in others the young  ones were just hatched. What a flying and screaming was there! Then came  the sound of the axe, blow upon blow; the forest was to be felled.  Waldemar Daa was about to build a costly ship, a three-decked  man-of-war, which it was expected the king would buy. So the wood fell,  the ancient landmark of the seaman, the home of the birds. The shrike  was frightened away; its nest was torn down; the osprey and all the  other birds lost their nests too, and they flew about distractedly,  shrieking in their terror and anger. The crows and the jackdaws screamed  in mockery, Caw! caw! Waldemar Daa and his three daughters stood in the  middle of the wood among the workmen. They all laughed at the wild cries  of the birds, except Anna Dorothea, who was touched by their distress,  and when they were about to fell a tree which was half-dead, and on  whose naked branches a black stork had built its nest, out of which the  young ones were sticking their heads, she begged them with tears in her  eyes to spare it. So the tree with the black stork's nest was allowed to  stand. It was only a little thing.    'The chopping and the sawing went on--the three-decker was built. The  master builder was a man of humble origin, but of noble loyalty; great  power lay in his eyes and on his forehead, and Waldemar Daa liked to  listen to him, and little Ida liked to listen too, the eldest  fifteen-year-old daughter. But whilst he built the ship for her father,  he built a castle in the air for himself, in which he and little Ida sat  side by side as man and wife. This might also have happened if his  castle had been built of solid stone, with moat and ramparts, wood and  gardens. But with all his wisdom the shipbuilder was only a poor bird,  and what business has a sparrow in a crane's nest? Whew! whew! I rushed  away, and he rushed away, for he dared not stay, and little Ida got over  it, as get over it she must.    'The fiery black horses stood neighing in the stables; they were worth  looking at, and they were looked at to some purpose too. An admiral was  sent from the King to look at the new man-of-war, with a view to  purchasing it. The admiral was loud in his admiration of the horses. I  heard all he said,' added the wind. 'I went through the open door with  the gentlemen and scattered the straw like gold before their feet.  Waldemar Daa wanted gold; the admiral wanted the black horses, and so he  praised them as he did; but his hints were not taken, therefore the ship  remained unsold. There it stood by the shore covered up with boards,  like a Noah's Ark which never reached the water. Whew! whew! get along!  get along! It was a miserable business. In the winter, when the fields  were covered with snow and the Belt was full of ice-floes which I drove  up on to the coast,' said the wind, 'the ravens and crows came in  flocks, the one blacker than the other, and perched upon the desolate,  dead ship by the shore. They screamed themselves hoarse about the forest  which had disappeared, and the many precious birds' nests which had been  devastated, leaving old and young homeless; and all for the sake of this  old piece of lumber, the proud ship which was never to touch the water!  I whirled the snow about till it lay in great heaps round the ship. I  let it hear my voice, and all that a storm has to say, I know that I did  my best to give it an idea of the sea. Whew! whew!'    'The winter passed by; winter and summer passed away! They come and go  just as I do. The snow-flakes, the apple blossom, and the leaves fall,  each in their turn. Whew! whew! they pass away, as men pass too!    'The daughters were still young. Little Ida, the rose, as lovely to look  at as when the shipbuilder turned his gaze upon her. I often took hold  of her long brown hair when she stood lost in thought by the apple-tree  in the garden. She never noticed that I showered apple-blossom over her  loosened hair; she only gazed at the red sunset against the golden  background of the sky, and the dark trees and bushes of the garden. Her  sister Johanna was like a tall, stately lily; she held herself as  stiffly erect as her mother, and seemed to have the same dread of  bending her stem. She liked to walk in the long gallery where the family  portraits hung. The ladies were painted in velvet and silk, with tiny  pearl embroidered caps on their braided tresses. Their husbands were all  clad in steel, or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel skins and stiff  blue ruffs; their swords hung loosely by their sides. Where would  Johanna's portrait one day hang on these walls? What would her noble  husband look like? These were her thoughts, and she even spoke them  aloud; I heard her as I swept through the long corridor into the  gallery, where I veered round again.    'Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, was only a child of fourteen, quiet  and thoughtful. Her large blue eyes, as clear as water, were very  solemn, but childhood's smile still played upon her lips; I could not  blow it away, nor did I wish to do so. I used to meet her in the garden,  the ravine, and in the manor fields. She was always picking flowers and  herbs, those she knew her father could use for healing drinks and  potions. Waldemar Daa was proud and conceited, but he was also learned,  and he knew a great deal about many things. One could see that, and many  whispers went about as to his learning. The fire blazed in his stove  even in summer, and his chamber door was locked. This went on for days  and nights, but he did not talk much about it. One must deal silently  with the forces of nature.

It did hurt  Rand like hell; a nice, sensational murder and no money in it for the  Tri-State Agency. Obviously, somebody would have to be persuaded to  finance an investigation. Preferably some innocent victim of unjust  suspicion; somebody who could best clear himself by unmasking the real  villain.... For \"villain,\" Rand mentally substituted \"public benefactor.\"    He was running over a list of possible suspects as he entered Rosemont.  Passing the little antique shop he slowed, backed, read the name \"Karen  Lawrence\" on the window, and then pulled over to the curb and got out.  Crossing the sidewalk, he went up the steps to the door, entering to the  jangling of a spring-mounted cowbell.    The girl dealer was inside, with a visitor, a sallow-faced,  untidy-looking man of indeterminate age who was opening  newspaper-wrapped packages on a table-top. Karen greeted Rand by name and  military rank; Rand told her he'd just look around till she was through.  She tossed him a look of comic reproach, as though she had counted on him  to rid her of the man with the packages.    \"Now, just you look at this-here, Miss Lawrence,\" the man was enthusing,  undoing another package. \"Here's something I know you'll want; I think  this-here is real quaint! Just look, now!\" He displayed some long,  narrow, dark object, holding it out to her. \"Ain't this-here an  interestin' item, now, Miss Lawrence?\"    \"_Ooooooh!_ What in heaven's name is that thing?\" she demanded.    \"That-there's a sword. A real African native sword. Look at that  scabbard, now; made out of real crocodile-skin. A whole young crocodile,  head, feet, an' all. I tell you, Miss Lawrence, that-there item is  unique!\"    \"It's revolting! It's the most repulsive object that's ever been brought  into this shop, which is saying quite a lot. Colonel Rand! If you don't  have a hangover this morning, will you please come here and look at this  thing?\"    Rand laid down the Merril carbine he had been examining and walked over  beside Karen. The man--whom Rand judged to be some rural free-lance  antique-prospector--extended the object of the girl's repugnance. It was  an African sword, all right, with a plain iron hilt and cross-guard. The  design looked Berber, but the workmanship was low-grade, and probably  attributable to some even more barbarous people. The scabbard was what  was really surprising, if you liked that kind of surprises. It was an  infant crocodile, rather indifferently smoke-cured; the sword simply went  in between the creature's jaws and extended the length of the body and  into the tail. Either end of a moldy-green leather thong had been  fastened to the two front paws for a shoulder-baldric. When new, Rand  thought, it must have given its wearer a really distinctive aroma, even  for Africa. He drew the blade gingerly, looked at it, and sheathed it  with caution.    \"East African; Danakil, or Somali, or something like that,\" he commented.  \"Be damn good and careful not to scratch yourself on that; if you do,  you'll need about a gallon of anti-tetanus shots.\"    \"Y'think it might be poisoned?\" the man with the dirty neck and the  month-old haircut inquired eagerly. \"See, Miss Lawrence? What I told you;  a real African native sword. I got that-there from Hen Sourbaw, over at  Feltonville; his uncle, the Reverend Sourbaw, that used to preach at  Hemlock Gap Church, brung it from Africa, himself, about fifty years ago.  He used to be a missionary, in his younger days.... I can make you an  awful good price on that-there item, Miss Lawrence.\"    \"God forbid!\" she exclaimed. \"All my customers are heavy drinkers; I  wouldn't want to answer for what might happen if some of them saw that  thing, suddenly.\"    \"Oh, well.... How about that-there little amethyst bottle, then?\"    \"Well ... I would give you seven dollars for that,\" she grudged.    \"Y'would? Well, it's yours, then. An' how about them-there salt-cellars,  an' that-there knife-box?\"    Rand wandered back to examining firearms. Eventually, after buying the  knife-box, Karen got rid of the man with the antiques. When he had gone,  she found a pack of cigarettes, offered it to Rand and lit one for  herself.    \"Well, now you see why girls leave home and start antique shops,\" she  said. \"Never a dull moment.... Wasn't that sword the awfullest thing you  ever saw, though?\"    \"Well, one of the ten awfullest,\" Rand conceded. \"I just stopped in to  give you some good news. You won't need to consider that offer of Arnold  Rivers's, any more. He is no longer interested in the Fleming  collection.\"    \"He isn't?\" An eager, happy light danced up in her eyes. \"You saw him  again this morning? What did he say?\"    \"He didn't say anything. He isn't talking any more, either. Fact is, he  isn't even breathing any more.\"    \"He.... You mean he's dead?\" She was surprised, even shocked. The shock  was probably a concession to good taste, but the surprise looked genuine.  \"When did he die? It must have been very sudden; I saw him a few days  ago, and he looked all right. Of course, he's been having trouble with  his lungs, but--\"    \"It was very sudden. Some time last night, some person or persons unknown  gave him a butt-and-bayonet job with a German Mauser out of a rack in his  shop. A most unpleasantly thorough job. I went to see him this morning,  hoping to badger something out of him about those pistols that are  missing from the Fleming collection, and found the body. I notified the  State Police, and just came from there.\"    \"For God's sake!\" The shock was genuine, too, now. \"Have the police any  idea--?\"    \"Not the foggiest. If some of the Fleming pistols turn up at his place,  I might think that had something to do with it. So far, though, they  haven't. I gave the shop a once-over-lightly before the cops arrived, and  couldn't find anything.\"    She tried to take a puff from her cigarette and found that she had broken  it in her fingers. She lit a new one from the mangled butt.    \"When did it happen?\" She tried to make the question sound casual.    \"That I couldn't say, either. Around midnight, would be my guess. They  might be able to fix a no-earlier time.\" An idea occurred to him, and he  smiled.    \"But that's dreadful!\" She really meant that. \"It's a terrible thing to  happen to anybody, being killed like that.\" She stopped just short of  adding: \"even Rivers.\" Instead, she continued: \"But I can't say I'm  really very sorry he's dead, Colonel.\"    \"Outside of maybe his wife, and the gunsmith who made his fake Walker  Colts and North & Cheney flintlocks, who is?\" he countered. \"Oh, yes;  Cecil Gillis. He's about due for induction into the Army of the  Unemployed, unless Mrs. Rivers intends carrying on the business.\"    Karen's eyes widened. \"Cecil Gillis!\" she exclaimed softly. \"I wonder,  now, if he has an alibi for last night!\"    \"Think he might need one?\" Rand asked. \"Of course I only saw him once,  but he didn't strike me as a possible candidate. I can't seem to see  young Gillis doing a messy job like this was, or going to all that manual  labor when he could have used something neat, like a pistol or a dagger.\"    \"Well, Cecil isn't quite the languishing flower he looks,\" Karen told  him. \"He does a lot of swimming, and he's one of the few people around  here who can beat me at tennis. And he has a motive. Maybe two motives.\"    \"Such as?\" Rand prompted.    \"Maybe you think Cecil is a--you know--one of those boys,\" she  euphemized. \"Well, he isn't. He takes a perfectly normal, and even  slightly wolfish, interest in the female of his species. And while Arnold  Rivers may have been a good provider from a financial standpoint, he  wasn't quite up to his wife's requirements in another important respect.  And Rivers was away a lot, on buying trips and so on, and when he was,  nobody ever saw Cecil leave the Rivers place in the evenings. At least,  that's the story; personally, I wouldn't know. Of course, where there's  smoke, there may be nothing more than somebody with a stogie, but, then,  there may be a regular conflagration.\"    \"That would be a perfectly satisfactory motive, under some  circumstances,\" Rand admitted. \"And the other?\"    \"Cecil might have been doing funny things with the books, and Rivers  might have caught him.\"    \"That would also be a good enough motive.\" It would also, Rand thought,  furnish an explanation for the burning of Rivers's record-cards. \"I'll  mention it to Mick McKenna; he's hard up for a good usable suspect. And  by the way, the news of this killing will be out before evening, but in  the meantime I wish you wouldn't mention it to anybody, or mention that  I was in here to tell you about it.\"    \"I won't. I'm glad you told me, though.... Do you think there may be a  chance that we can get the collection, now?\"    \"I wouldn't know why not. Rivers's offer was pretty high; there aren't  many other dealers who would be able to duplicate it.... Well, don't take  any Czechoslovakian Stiegel.\"    He moved his car down the street to the Rosemont Inn, where he went into  the combination bar and grill and had a Bourbon-and-water at the bar.  Then he ordered lunch, and, while waiting for it, went into a phone-booth  and dialed the number of Stephen Gresham's office in New Belfast.    \"I'd hoped to catch you before you left for lunch,\" he said, when the  lawyer answered. \"There's been a new development in the Fleming  business.\" He had decided to follow the same line as with Karen Lawrence.  \"You needn't worry about Arnold Rivers's offer, any more.\"    \"Ha! So he backed out?\"    \"He was shoved out,\" Rand corrected. \"On the sharp end of a Mauser  bayonet, sometime "]]]
