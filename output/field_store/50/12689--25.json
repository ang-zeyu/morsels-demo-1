the exploring party.  If they believed that the Terran flitter was immobilized when he, and  he alone, was not behind its controls, this was just the move they  would make. But there they were wrong. Soriki might not be able to  repair or service the motor, but in a pinch he could take it up, send  it westward, and land it beside the spacer. Each and every man aboard  the _RS 10_ had that much training.    Now the com-tech was scowling. He had grasped the significance of that  arrangement as quickly as Raf. \"How long do I wait for you, sir?\" he  asked in a voice which had lost its usual good-humored drawl.    And at that inquiry Captain Hobart showed signs of irritation. \"Your  suspicions are not founded on facts,\" he stated firmly. \"These people  have displayed no signs of wanting to harm us. And an attitude of  distrust at this point might be fatal for future friendly contact.  Lablet is sure that they have a highly complex society, probably  advanced beyond Terran standards, and that their technical skills will  be of vast benefit to us. As it happens we have come at just the right  moment in their history, when they are striving to get back on their  feet after a disastrous series of wars. It is as if a group of  off-world explorers had allied themselves with us after the Burn-Off.  We can exchange information which will be of mutual benefit.\"    \"If any off-world explorers had set down on Terra after the Burn-Off,\"  observed Soriki softly, \"they would have come up against Pax. And just  how long would they have lasted?\"    Hobart had turned away. If he heard that half-whisper, he did not  choose to acknowledge it. But the truth in the com-tech's words made  an impression on Raf, a crew of aliens who had been misguided enough  to seek out and try to establish friendly relations with the officials  of Pax would have had a short and most unhappy shrift. If all the  accounts of that dark dictatorship were true, they would have vanished  from Terra, and not in their ships either. What if something like Pax  ruled here? They had no way of knowing for sure.    Raf's eyes met Soriki's, and the com-tech's hand dropped to hook  fingers in his belt within touching distance of his side arm. The  flitter pilot nodded.    \"Kurbi!\" Hobart's impatient call sent him on his way. But there was  some measure of relief in knowing that Soriki was left behind and that  they had this slender link with escape.    He had tramped the streets of that other alien city. There there had  been some semblance of habitation; here was abandonment. Earth drifted  in dunes to half block the lanes, and here and there climbing vines  had broken down masonry and had dislodged blocks of the paved sideways  and courtyards.    The party threaded their way from one narrow lane to another, seeming  to avoid the wider open stretches of the principal thoroughfares, Raf  became aware of an unpleasant odor in the air which he vaguely  associated with water, and a few minutes afterward he caught glimpses  of the river between the buildings which fronted on it. Here the party  turned abruptly at a right angle, heading westward once more, passing  vast, blank-walled structures which might have been warehouses.    One of the aliens just ahead of Raf in the line of march suddenly  swung around, his weapon pointing up, and from its nose shot a beam of  red-yellow light which brought an answering shrill scream as a large,  winged creature came fluttering down. The killer kicked at the  crumpled thing as he passed. As far as Raf could see there had been no  reason for that wanton slaying.    The head of the party had reached a doorway, sealed shut by what  looked like a solid slab of material. He placed both palms flat down  on its surface at shoulder height and leaned forward against it,  almost as if he were whispering some secret formula. Raf watched the  muscles stand up on his slender arms as he exerted strength. And then  the door split in two, and his fellows helped him push the separate  halves back into the wall.    Lablet, Hobart, and Raf were among the last to enter. It was as if  their companions had now forgotten them, for the aliens were pushing  on at a pace which took them down an empty corridor at a quickening  trot.    The corridor ended in a ramp which did not slope in one straight reach  but curled around itself, so that in some places only the presence of  a handrail, to which they all clung, kept them from losing balance.  Then they gathered in a vaulted room, one of which opened a complete  circle of closed doors.    There was some argument among the aliens, a dispute of sorts over  which of those doors was to be opened first, and the Terrans drew a  little apart, unable to follow the twittering words and  lightning-swift gestures.    Raf tried to work out the patterns of color which swirled and looped  over each door and around the walls, only to discover that too long an  examination of any one band, or an attempt to trace its beginning or  end, awoke a sick sensation which approached inner turmoil the longer  he looked. At last he had to rest his eyes by studying the gray  flooring under his boots.    The aliens finally made up their minds, or else one group was able to  outargue the other, for they converged upon a door directly opposite  the ramp. Once more they went through the process of unsealing the  panels, while the Terrans, drawn by curiosity, were close behind them  as they entered the long room beyond. Here were shelves in solid tiers  along the walls, crowded with such an array of strange objects that  Raf, after one mystified look, thought that it might well take months  to sort them all out.    In addition, long tables divided the chamber into aisles. Halfway down  one of these narrow passageways the aliens had gathered in a group as  silent and intent now as they had been noisy outside. Raf could see  nothing to so rivet their attention but a series of scuffed marks in  the dust which covered the floor. But an alien, whom he recognized as  the officer who had taken him to inspect the globe, moved carefully  along that trail, following it to a second door. And as Raf pushed  down another aisle, paralleling his course, he was conscious of a  sickly sweet, stomach-churning stench. Something was very, very dead  and not too far away.    The officer must have come to the same conclusion, for he hurried to  open the other door. Before them now was a narrow hall broken by slit  windows, near the roof, through which entered sunlight. And one such  beam fully illuminated a carcass as large as that of a small elephant,  or so it seemed to Raf's startled gaze.    It was difficult to make out the true appearance of the creature,  though guessing from the scaled strips of skin it had been reptilian,  for the body had been found by scavengers and feasting had been in  progress.    The alien officer skirted the corpse gingerly. Raf thought that he  would like to investigate the body closely but could not force himself  to that highly disagreeable task. There was a chorus of excited  exclamation from the doorway as others crowded there.    But the officer, having circled the carcass, turned his attention to  the dusty floor again. If there had been any trail there, it was now  muddled past their reading, for remnants of the grisly meal had been  dragged back and forth. The alien picked his way fastidiously through  the noxious debris to the end of the long room. Raf, with the same  care, toured the edge of the chamber in his wake.    They were out in a smaller passageway, which was taking them  underground, the Terran estimated. Then there was a large space with  barred cells about it and a second corridor. The stench of the death  chamber either clung to them, or was wafted from another point, and  Raf gagged as an especially foul blast caught him full in the face. He  kept a sharp look about him for signs of those feasters. The feast had  not been finished--it might have been that their entrance into the  storeroom had disturbed the scavengers. And things formidable enough  to drag down that scaled horror were not foes he would choose to meet  in these unlighted ways.    The passage began to slope upward once more, and Raf saw a half-moon  of light ahead, brilliant light which could only come from the sun.  The alien was outlined there as he went out; then he himself was  scuffing through sand close upon another death scene. The dead  monster had had its counterparts, and here they were, sprawled out,  mangled, and torn. Raf remained by the archway, for even the open air  and the morning winds could not destroy the reek which seemed as  deadly as a gas attack.    It must have disturbed the officer too, for he hesitated. Then with  visible effort he advanced toward the hunks of flesh, casting back and  forth as if to find some clue to the manner of their death. He was  still so engaged when a second alien burst out of the archway, a  splintered length of white held out before him as if he had made some  important discovery.    The officer grabbed that shaft away from him, turning it around in his  hands.
