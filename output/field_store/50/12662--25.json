We found things fairly quiet this  time when we went up. The Germans had been making some very fierce  attacks, trying to cross the river Rawka, and therefore their losses  must have been very heavy, but the Russians were merely holding their  ground, and so there were comparatively few wounded on our side. This  time we were able to divide up into shifts for the work--a luxury we  were very seldom able to indulge in.    We had previously made great friends with a Siberian captain, and we  found to our delight that he was living in a little hut close to our  train. He asked me one day if I would like to go up to the positions  with him and take some Christmas presents round to the men. Of course I  was more than delighted, and as he was going up that night and I was not  on duty, the general very kindly gave permission for me to go up too. In  the end Colonel S. and one of the Russian Sisters accompanied us as  well. The captain got a rough cart and horse to take us part of the way,  and he and another man rode on horseback beside us. We started off about  ten o'clock, a very bright moonlight night--so bright that we had to  take off our brassards and anything that could have shown up white  against the dark background of the woods. We drove as far as the  pine-woods in which the Russian positions were, and left the cart and  horses in charge of a Cossack while we were away. The general had  intended that we should see the reserve trenches, but we had seen plenty  of them before, and our captain meant that we should see all the fun  that was going, so he took us right up to the front positions. We went  through the wood silently in single file, taking care that if possible  not even a twig should crackle under our feet, till we came to the very  front trenches at the edge of the wood. We crouched down and watched for  some time. Everything was brilliantly illuminated by the moonlight, and  we had to be very careful not to show ourselves. A very fierce German  attack was going on, and the bullets were pattering like hail on the  trees all round us. We could see nothing for some time but the smoke of  the rifles.    The Germans were only about a hundred yards away from us at this time,  and we could see the river Rawka glittering below in the moonlight. What  an absurd little river to have so much fighting about. That night it  looked as if we could easily wade across it. The captain made a sign,  and we crept with him along the edge of the wood, till we got to a  Siberian officer's dug-out. At first we could not see anything, then we  saw a hole between two bushes, and after slithering backwards down the  hole, we got into a sort of cave that had been roofed in with poles and  branches, and was absolutely invisible a few steps away. It was  fearfully hot and frowzy--a little stove in the corner threw out a great  heat, and the men all began to smoke, which made it worse.    We stayed a while talking, and then crawled along to visit one of the  men's dug-outs, a German bullet just missing us as we passed, and  burying itself in a tree. There were six men already in the dug-out, so  we did not attempt to get in, but gave them tobacco and matches, for  which they were very grateful. These men had an \"ikon\" or sacred picture  hanging up inside their cave; the Russian soldiers on active service  carry a regimental ikon, and many carry them in their pockets too. One  man had his life saved by his ikon. He showed it to us; the bullet had  gone just between the Mother and the Child, and was embedded in the  wood.    It was all intensely interesting, and we left the positions with great  reluctance, to return through the moonlit pine-woods till we reached our  cart. We had indeed made a night of it, for it was five o'clock in the  morning when we got back to the train once more, and both the doctor and  I were on duty again at eight. But it was well worth losing a night's  sleep to go up to the positions during a violent German attack. I wonder  what the general would have said if he had known!    We finished our forty-eight hours' duty and returned once more to  Zyradow. I was always loth to leave Radzivilow. The work there was  splendid, and there more than anywhere else I have been to one feels the  war as a High Adventure.    War would be the most glorious game in the world if it were not for the  killing and wounding. In it one tastes the joy of comradeship to the  full, the taking and giving, and helping and being helped in a way that  would be impossible to conceive in the ordinary world. At Radzivilow,  too, one could see the poetry of war, the zest of the frosty mornings,  and the delight of the camp-fire at night, the warm, clean smell of the  horses tethered everywhere, the keen hunger, the rough food sweetened by  the sauce of danger, the riding out in high hope in the morning; even  the returning wounded in the evening did not seem altogether such a bad  thing out there. One has to die some time, and the Russian peasants  esteem it a high honour to die for their \"little Mother\" as they call  their country. The vision of the High Adventure is not often vouchsafed  to one, but it is a good thing to have had it--it carries one through  many a night at the shambles. Radzivilow is the only place it came to  me. In Belgium one's heart was wrung by the poignancy of it all, its  littleness and defencelessness; in Lodz one could see nothing for the  squalor and \"frightfulness\"; in other places the ruined villages, the  flight of the dazed, terrified peasants show one of the darkest sides of  war.           *       *       *       *       *    It was New Year's Eve when we returned to Zyradow, and found ourselves  billeted in a new house where there was not only a bed each, but a  bathroom and a bath. Imagine what that meant to people who had not  undressed at night for more than three weeks.    Midnight struck as we were having supper, and we drank the health of the  New Year in many glasses of tea. What would the lifted veil of time  disclose in this momentous year just opening for us?    It did not begin particularly auspiciously for me, for within the first  few days of it I got a wound in the leg from a bit of shrapnel, was  nearly killed by a bomb from a German Taube, and caught a very bad chill  and had to go to bed with pleurisy--all of which happenings gave me  leisure to write this little account of my adventures.    The bomb from the Taube was certainly the nearest escape I am ever  likely to have in this world. I was walking over a piece of open ground,  saw nothing, heard nothing, was dreaming in fact, when suddenly I heard  a whirring overhead, and just above me was a German aeroplane. Before I  had time to think, down came a bomb with a fearful explosion. I could  not see anything for a minute, and then the smoke cleared away, and I  was standing at the edge of a large hole. The bomb had fallen into a bed  of soft mud, and exploded upwards. Some soldiers who were not very far  off rushed to see if I were killed, and were very surprised to find that  I was practically unhurt. A bomb thrown that same afternoon that  exploded on the pavement killed and wounded nine people.    The wound was from a stray bit of shrapnel and was only a trifle,  fortunately, and soon healed. The pleurisy was a longer job and  compelled me to go to bed for a fortnight. I was very miserable at being  the only idle person I knew, till it occurred to me to spend my time in  writing this little book, and a subsequent short holiday in Petrograd  enabled me to finish it.    My enforced holiday is over now and I am on my way back to my beloved  column once more--to the life on the open road--with its joys and  sorrows, its comradeship, its pain and its inexplicable happiness--back  once more to exchange the pen for the more ready weapon of the forceps.    And so I will leave this brief account of what I have seen in this great  war. I know better than anyone can tell me what an imperfect sketch it  is, but the history of the war will have to be studied from a great many  different angles before a picture of it will be able to be presented in  its true perspective, and it may be that this particular angle will be  of some little interest to those who are interested in Red Cross work in  different countries. Those who are workers themselves will forgive the  roughness of the sketch, which was written during my illness in snatches  and at odd times, on all sorts of stray pieces of paper and far from any  books of reference; they will perhaps forget the imperfections in  remembering that it has been written close to the turmoil of the  battlefield, to the continual music of the cannon and the steady tramp  of feet marching past my window.

The science, so long  regarded _dry_ and uninteresting, becomes delightful and easy; new and  valuable truths burst upon us at each advancing step, and we feel to  bless God for the ample means afforded us for obtaining knowledge from,  and communicating it to others, on the most important affairs of time  and eternity.          LECTURE VIII.    ON VERBS.        Unpleasant to expose error.--Verbs defined.--Every thing acts.--      Actor and object.--Laws.--Man.--Animals.--Vegetables.--Minerals.--      Neutrality degrading.--Nobody can explain a neuter verb.--_One_ kind      of verbs.--_You_ must decide.--Importance of teaching children the      truth.--Active verbs.--Transitive verbs false.--Samples.--Neuter      verbs examined.--Sit.--Sleep.--Stand.--Lie.--Opinion of Mrs.      W.--Anecdote.      We now come to the consideration of that class of words which in the  formation of language are called _Verbs_. You will allow me to bespeak  your favorable attention, and to insist most strenuously on the  propriety of a free and thoro examination into the nature and use of  these words. I shall be under the necessity of performing the thankless  task of exposing the errors of honest, wise, and good men, in order to  remove difficulties which have long existed in works on language, and  clear the way for a more easy and consistent explanation of this  interesting and essential department of literature. I regret the  necessity for such labors; but no person who wishes the improvement of  mankind, or is willing to aid the growth of the human intellect, in its  high aspirations after truth, knowledge, and goodness, should shrink  from a frank exposition of what he deems to be error, nor refuse his  assistance, feeble tho it may be, in the establishment of correct  principles.    In former lectures we have confined our remarks to things and a  description of their characters and relations, so that every entity of  which we can conceive a thought, or concerning which we can form an  expression, has been defined and described in the use of nouns and  adjectives. Every thing in creation, of which we think, material or  immaterial, real or imaginary, and to which we give a name, to represent  the idea of it, comes under the class of words called nouns. The words  which specify or distinguish one thing from another, or describe its  properties, character, or relations, are designated as adjectives. There  is only one other employment left for words, and that is the expression  of the actions, changes, or inherent tendencies of things. This  important department of knowledge is, in grammar, classed under the head  of =Verbs=.           *       *       *       *       *    _Verb_ is derived from the Latin _verbum_, which signifies a _word_. By  specific application it is applied to those _words_ only which express  action, correctly understood; the same as Bible, derived from the Greek  \"_biblos_\" means literally _the book_, but, by way of eminence, is  applied to the sacred scriptures only.    This interesting class of words does not deviate from the correct  principles which we have hitherto observed in these lectures. It depends  on established laws, exerted in the regulation of matter and thought;  and whoever would learn its sublime use must be a close observer of  things, and the mode of their existence. The important character it  sustains in the production of ideas of the changes and tendencies of  things and in the transmission of thought, will be found simple, and  obvious to all.    Things exist; Nouns name them.    Things differ; Adjectives define or describe them.    Things act; Verbs express their actions.        _All Verbs denote action._    By action, we mean not only perceivable motion, but an inherent tendency  to change, or resist action. It matters not whether we speak of animals  possessed of the power of locomotion; of vegetables, which _send_ forth  their branches, leaves, blossoms, and fruits; or of minerals, which  _retain_ their forms, positions, and properties. The same principles are  concerned, the same laws exist, and should be observed in all our  attempts to understand their operations, or employ them in the promotion  of human good. Every thing acts according to the ability it possesses;  from the small particle of sand, which _occupies_ its place upon the sea  shore, up thro the various gradation of being, to the tall archangel,  who _bows_ and _worships_ before the throne of the uncreated Cause of  all things and actions which exist thro out his vast dominions.    As all actions presuppose an _actor_, so every action must result on  some _object_. No effect can exist without an efficient cause to produce  it; and no cause can exist without a corresponding effect resulting from  it. These mutual relations, helps, and dependencies, are manifest in all  creation. Philosophy, religion, the arts, and all science, serve only to  develope these primary laws of nature, which unite and strengthen,  combine and regulate, preserve and guide the whole. From the Eternal I  AM, the uncreated, self-existent, self-sustaining =Cause= of all things,  down to the minutest particle of dust, evidences may be traced of the  existence and influence of these laws, in themselves irresistible,  exceptionless, and immutable. Every thing has a place and a duty  assigned it; and harmony, peace, and perfection are the results of a  careful and judicious observance of the laws given for its regulation.  Any infringement of these laws will produce disorder, confusion, and  distraction.    Man is made a little lower than the angels, possessed of a mind capable  of reason, improvement, and happiness; an intellectual soul inhabiting a  mortal body, the connecting link between earth and heaven--the material  and spiritual world. As a physical being, he is subject, in common with  other things, to the laws which regulate matter: as an intellectual  being, he is governed by the laws which regulate mind: as possessed of  both a body and mind, a code of moral laws demand his observance in all  the social relations and duties of life. Obedience to these laws is the  certain source of health of body, and peace of mind. An infringement of  them will as certainly be attended with disease and suffering to the  one, and sorrow and anguish to the other.    Lower grades of animals partake of many qualities in common with man. In  some they are deficient; in others they are superior. Some animals are  possessed of all but reason, and even in that, the highest of them come  very little short of the lowest of the human species. If they have not  reason, they possess an instinct which nearly approaches it. These  qualities dwindle down gradually thro the various orders and varieties  of animated nature, to the lowest grade of animalculae, a multitude of  which may inhabit a single drop of water; or to the zoophytes and  lythophytes, which form the connecting link between the animal and  vegetable kingdom; as the star-fish, the polypus, and spunges. Then  strike off into another kingdom, and observe the laws vegetable life.  Mark the tall pine which has grown from a small seed which _sent_ forth  its root downwards and its trunk upwards, drawing nourishment from  earth, air, and water, till it now waves its top to the passing breeze,  a hundred feet above this dirty earth: or the oak or olive, which have  _maintained_ their respective positions a dozen centuries despite the  operations of wind and weather, and have shed their foliage and their  seeds to propagate their species and extend their kinds to different  places. While a hundred generations have lived and died, and the country  often changed masters, they resist oppression, scorn misrule, and retain  rights and privileges which are slowly encroached upon by the inroads of  time, which will one day triumph over them, and they fall helpless to  the earth, to submit to the chemical operations which shall dissolve  their very being and cause them to mingle with the common dust, yielding  their strength to give life and power to other vegetables which shall  occupy their places.[10] Or mark the living principle in the \"sensitive  plant,\" which withers at every touch, and suffers long ere it regains  its former vigor.    Descend from thence, down thro the various gradations of vegetable life,  till you pass the narrow border and enter the mineral world. Here you  will see displayed the same sublime principle, tho in a modified degree.  Minerals _assume_ different shapes, hues and relations; they increase  and diminish, attach and divide under various circumstances, all the  while _retaining_ their identity and properties, and exerting their  abilities according to the means they possess, till compelled to yield  to a superior power, and learn to submit to the laws which operate in  every department of this mutable world.    _Every_ thing _acts_ according to the ability God has bestowed upon it;  and man can do no more. He has authority over all things on earth, and  yet he is made to depend upon all. His authority extends no farther than  a privilege, under wholesome restrictions, of making the whole  subservient to his real good. When he goes beyond this, he usurps a  power which belongs not to him, and the destruction of his happiness  pays the forfeit of his imprudence."]]]
