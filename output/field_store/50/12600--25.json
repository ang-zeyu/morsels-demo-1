Such appears to have been the _etat d'ame_ of Bengal when the  Government of India promulgated the measure of administrative  redistribution known as the Partition of Bengal.          CHAPTER VII.    THE STORM IN BENGAL.      The merits or demerits of the Partition of Bengal have already been  discussed to satiety. As far as its purpose was to promote  administrative efficiency it is no longer on its defence. Bengal proper  is still the most populous province in India, but it has been brought  within limits that at least make efficient administration practicable.  The eastern districts, now included in the new province, which had been  hitherto lamentably neglected, have already gained enormously by the  change, which was at the same time only an act of justice to the large  Mahomedan majority who received but scanty consideration from Calcutta.  The only people who perhaps suffered inconvenience or material loss were  absentee landlords, pleaders, and moneylenders, and some of the  merchants of Calcutta, Anglo-Indian as well as native, who believed  their interests to be affected by the transfer of the seat of provincial  government for the Eastern Bengal districts to Dacca. Nevertheless the  Partition was the signal for an agitation such as India had not hitherto  witnessed. I say advisedly the signal rather than the cause. For if the  Partition in itself had sufficed to rouse spontaneous popular feeling,  it would have been unnecessary for the leaders of the agitation to  resort in the rural districts to gross misrepresentations of the objects  of that measure. What all the smouldering discontent, all the  reactionary disaffection centred in Calcutta read into the Partition was  a direct attack upon the primacy of the educated classes that had made  Calcutta the capital of the Bengalee \"nation.\" The Universities Act of  1904, it was alleged, had been the first attempt on the part of a  masterful Viceroy to reduce their influence by curtailing their control  of higher education. Partition was a further attempt to hamper their  activities by cutting half the \"nation\" adrift from its \"intellectual\"  capital. This was a cry well calculated to appeal to many \"moderates,\"  whom the merely political aspects of the question would have left  relatively unmoved and it certainly proved effective, for in Calcutta  feeling ran very strong. Whilst \"monster\" demonstrations were organized  in Calcutta and in the principal towns of the _mofussil_, the wildest  reports were sedulously disseminated amongst the rural population.  Partition was meant to pave the way for undoing the Permanent Settlement  which governs the Land Revenue in Bengal, and, once the Permanent  Settlement out of the way, Government would screw up the land tax. As  for the creation of the new province, it was intended to facilitate the  compulsory emigration of the people from the plains, who would be driven  to work on the Englishmen's tea plantations in the far-off jungles of  Assam. Reports of this kind were well calculated to alarm both the  _Zemindars_, who had waxed fat on the Permanent Settlement, and the  credulous _rayats_, whose labour is indispensable to the _zemindar_  squirarchy. In the towns, on the other hand, the masses were told that  Partition was an insult to the \"terrible goddess\" Kali, the most popular  of all Hindu deities in Bengal, and, in order to popularize the protest  amongst the small townsfolk, amongst artisans and petty traders, the cry  of _Swadeshi_ was coupled with that of _Bande Mataram_.    The spirit of revolt against Western political authority had been for  some time past spreading to the domain of economics. _Swadeshi_ in  itself and so far as it means the intelligent encouragement of  indigenous is perfectly legitimate, and in this sense the Government of  India had practised _Swadeshi_ long before it was taken up for purposes  of political agitation by those who look upon it primarily as an  economic weapon against their rulers. It was now to receive a formidable  development. _Swadeshi_ must strike at the flinty heart of the British  people by cutting off the demand for British manufactured goods and  substituting in their place the products of native labour. At the first  great meeting held at the Calcutta Town Hall to protest against  Partition, the building was to have been draped in black as a sign of  \"national\" mourning, but the idea was ostentatiously renounced because  the only materials available were of English manufacture. Not only did  the painful circumstances of the hour forbid any self-respecting  Bengalee from using foreign-made articles, but some means had to be  found of compelling the lukewarm to take the same lofty view of their  duties. So the cry of boycott was raised, and it is worth noting, as  evidence of the close contact and co-operation between the forces of  unrest in the Deccan and in Bengal, that at the same time as it was  raised in Calcutta by Mr. Surendranath Banerjee it was raised also at  Poona by Tilak who perhaps foresaw much more clearly the lawlessness to  which it would lead. For, though the cry fell on deaf ears in Bombay,  the boycott did not remain by any means an idle threat in Bengal. The  movement was placed under the special patronage of Kali and vows were  administered to large crowds in the forecourts of her great temple at  Calcutta and in her various shrines all over Bengal. The religious  character with which the leaders sought to invest the boycott propaganda  showed how far removed was the _swadeshi_ which they preached from a  mere innocent economic propaganda for the furtherance of native  industries. For a description of the Tantric rites connected with  _Shakti_ worship I must refer readers to M. Barth's learned work on \"The  religions of India,\" of which an English translation has been published  by Messrs Truebner in their Oriental series. In its extreme forms  _Shakti_ worship finds expression in licentious aberrations which,  however lofty may be the speculative theories that gave birth to them,  represent the most extravagant forms of delirious mysticism. Yet such  men as Mr. Surendranath Banerjee[7], who in his relations with  Englishmen claims to represent the fine flower of Western education and  Hindu enlightenment, did not hesitate to call the popularity of _Shakti_  worship in aid in order to stimulate the boycott of British goods. To  prevent any blacksliding the agitators had ready to hand an organization  which they did not hesitate to use. The gymnastic societies founded in  Bengal for physical training and semi-military drill on the model of  those established by Tilak in the Deccan were transformed into bands of  _samitis_ or \"national volunteers,\" and students and schoolboys who had  been encouraged from the first to take part in public meetings and to  parade the streets in procession as a protest against Partition, were  mobilized to picket the bazaars and enforce the boycott. Nor were their  methods confined to moral suasion. Where it failed they were quite ready  to use force. The Hindu leaders had made desperate attempts to enlist  the support of the Mahomedans, and not without some success, until the  latter began to realize the true meaning both of the Partition and of  the agitation against it. Nothing was better calculated to enlighten  them than another feature introduced also from the Deccan into the  \"national\" propaganda. In the Deccan the cult of Shivaji, as the epic  hero of Mahratta history, was intelligible enough. But in Bengal his  name had been for generations a bogey with which mothers hushed their  babies, and the Mahratta Ditch in Calcutta still bears witness to the  terror produced by the daring raids of Mahratta horsemen. To set Shivaji  up in Bengal on the pedestal of Nationalism in the face of such  traditions was no slight feat, and all Mr. Surendranath Banerjee's  popularity barely availed to perform it successfully. But to identify  the cause of Nationalism with the cult of the Mahratta warrior-king who  had first arrested the victorious career and humbled the pride of the  Mahomedan conquerors of Hindustan was not the way to win over to it the  Mahomedans of Bengal. In Eastern Bengal especially, with the exception  of a few landlords and pleaders whose interests were largely bound up  with those of the Hindus, the Mahomedans as a community had everything  to gain and nothing to lose by the Partition. For those amongst them who  were merchants the boycott spelt serious injury to their trade and led  in some instances to reprisals in which the Hindus fared badly. Whenever  it happened in this way that the biter was bit, the Bengalee Press  accused the Government of encouraging the revival of sectarian strife,  just as it denounced every measure for the maintenance of order which  the Government was compelled to take in the discharge of one of its most  elementary duties, as brutal repression and arbitrary vindictiveness,  and any mistake of procedure made by some subordinate official under the  stress of a very critical situation was distorted and magnified into a  gross denial of justice. But it was out of the punishments very properly  inflicted upon the misguided schoolboys and students whom the  politicians had put in the forefront of the fray that the greatest  capital was made. Whilst the politicians themselves prudently remained  for the most part in Calcutta, making high-sounding speeches and writing  inflammatory articles, or were careful in their own overt demonstrations  not to overstep the extreme bounds of legality, they showered telegrams  and letters of congratulation on the young \"martyrs\" who had been duly  castigated.    The leaders of the movement had also another string to their bow which  they used with considerable effect. Never before had there been such  close contact between Indian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#19)"],[1,"great  musicians. It can set off against our trinity of Corneille, Racine, and  Moliere, the no less glorious Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But Germany  seems to have lost all respect for the meaning of its own music and for  its own glories. Instead of watching over the purity of the text of its  masterpieces, it alters them at its pleasure and makes them all but  unrecognizable. We abuse nuances but they were rare in earlier days. An  orchestra conductor who performs symphonies by Haydn and Mozart, even by  Beethoven, has the right to make additions. But it is intolerable that  the scores should be printed with these nuances and bowings which are in  no way due to the author and which are imposed by the editor.  Nevertheless, that is what happens, and it is impossible to tell where  the authentic text ends and the interpolation begins. In addition, the  interpolation may be the exact contrary of what the author intended.    This evil is at its worst in piano music. Our famous teachers, like  Marmontel and Le Couppey, have published editions of the classics which  are full of their own directions. But the player is forewarned; it is  the Marmontel or Le Couppey edition and makes no pretence of  authenticity. In Germany, however, there are supposedly authentic  editions, based on the originals, but which superimpose their own  pernicious inventions on the author's text.    The touch of the piano used to be different from what it is to-day. The  directions in Mozart's and Beethoven's works show that they used the  execution of stringed instruments as their model. The touch was lighter  and the fingers were raised so that the notes were separated slightly,  and not run together except when indicated. The supposition is that this  must have led to a dryness of tone. I remember to have heard in my  childhood some old people whose playing was singularly hopping. Then,  there came a reaction, and with it a passion for slurring the notes.  When I was Stamaty's pupil, it was considered most difficult to \"tie\"  the notes; that required, however, only dexterity and suppleness. \"When  she learns to 'tie,' she will know how to play,\" said the mother of a  young pianist. Nevertheless, the trick of perpetual _legato_ becomes  exceedingly monotonous and takes away all character from the pianoforte  classics. But it is insisted on everywhere in the modern German  editions. Throughout there are connections seemingly interminable in  length, and indications of _legato_, _sempre legato_, which the author  not only did not indicate, but in places where it is easy to see that he  intended the exact opposite.    If this is the case, what shall be said of marking the fingering on all  the notes--which often makes good playing impossible. Liszt taught  hundreds of pupils according to the best principles, yet such erroneous  principles have prevailed!    Disciples of the ivory keys are numerous in our day. Everybody wants to  have a piano, and everybody plays it or thinks he does, which is not  always the same thing, and few really understand what the term \"to play  the piano,\" so currently used, means.    The harpsichord reigned supreme before the appearance of the piano--an  instrument which is beloved by some and execrated by others. To his  utter amazement Reyer was considered an enemy of the pianoforte. The  harpsichord has been revived of late so that it is needless to describe  it. It lacks strength, and that was the reason it was dethroned in a  period when strength was everything. On the other hand, it has  distinction and elegance. As the player can not modify the intensity of  the sound by a single pressure of the finger--in which it resembles the  organ--like the organ, with its multiple keyboards and registers, the  harpsichord has a wide variety of effects and affords the opportunity  for several octaves to sound simultaneously. As a result, while music  written for the harpsichord gains in strength and expression on the  modern instrument, it often assumes a deceptive monotony for which the  author is not responsible.    The players of the harpsichord were ignorant of muscular effects; there  was nothing of the unchained lion about them. The delicate hands of a  marquise lost none of their gracefulness as they skimmed over the  keyboards, and the red or black keys emphasized their whiteness.    The introduction of the hammer in the place of the tiny nib permitted  the modification of the quality of sound by differences in the pressure  of the fingers, and also the production at will of such nuances as  _forte_ and _piano_ without recourse to the different registers. This is  the reason why the new instrument was first called the pianoforte. The  word was long and cumbersome and was cut in half. When it became  necessary to _assault_ the note, they used the phrase \"to hit the  forte.\" The papers which gave accounts of young Mozart's concerts  praised him for his ability to \"hit.\"    Nevertheless one did not hit hard. These keyboards with their limited  keys responded so easily that a child's fingers were sufficient. I first  played on one of these instruments at the age of three. It was made by  Zimmerman, whose son was Gounod's father-in-law.    Later, the weight of the keys was increased to get a greater volume of  sound. Then, when long-haired _virtuosi_, playing by main strength,  produced peals of thunder, they really \"_toucha du piano_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    To return to _Orphee_ and end as we began, I have to make a painful  confession. If the works of Gluck in general and _Orphee_ in particular  have had a happy influence on our musical taste, a passage from this  last work has been a noxious influence,--the famous chorus of the demons  \"_Quel est l'audacieux--qui dans ces sombres lieux--ose porter ses  pas?_\"    In the old days French opera was based on declamation and it was  scrupulously respected even in the arias. There is a fine example of  this excellent system in Lully's famous aria from _Medusa_ to prove what  strength results from a close relation between the accent of the verse  and the music. Gluck was one of the most fervent disciples of this  system, but _Orphee_, as we know, was derived from _Orfeo_. The question  was whether he could even think of suppressing this spectacular chorus  with its amazing strength which was one of the principal reasons for the  work's success. Unfortunately the music of the chorus was moulded on the  Italian text, and each verse ended with the accent on the antepenult,  which occurs frequently in German and Italian, but never in French. And  they sing:        Quel est l'auDAcieux      Qui dans ces SOMbres lieux      Ose porTER ses pas      Et devant LE trepas          Ne fremit pas?    As French is not strongly accented such faults are tolerated. Gluck's  theme impressed itself on the memory, so that he dealt a terrific blow  to the purity of prosody. We gradually became so disinterested in this  that by Auber's time scarcely any attention was paid to it. Finally,  Offenbach appeared. He was a German by birth and his musical ideas  naturally rhymed with German in direct contradiction to the French words  to which they applied. This constant bungling passed for originality.  Sometimes it would have been necessary to change the division of a  measure to get a correct melody, as in the song:        Un p'tit bonhomme      Pas plus haut qu'ca.    In such a case we might say that he did wrong for the mere pleasure of  going astray. But popular taste was so corrupted that no one noticed it  and everybody who wrote in the lighter vein fell into the same habits.    We owe a debt of gratitude to Andre Messager for breaking away from this  manner and setting musical phraseology aright. His return to the old  traditions was not the least of the attractions of his delightful  _Veronique_.    But we are wandering far from Gluck and _Orphee_, although not so far  as we might think. In art, as in everything, extremes meet, and there  are all kinds of tastes.          CHAPTER XVI    DELSARTE      Felix Duquesnal in one of his brilliant articles has written something  about Delsarte, the singer, in connection with his controversy with  Madame Carvalho. The cause of this controversy was the lessons she took  from him. The name of Delsarte should never be forgotten, as I shall try  to explain. Madame Carvalho did not refuse to pay Delsarte for her  lessons, but she did not want to be called his pupil. Although she had  attended the Conservatoire, she wanted to be known solely as a pupil of  Duprez. As a matter of fact it was Duprez who knew how to make the  \"Little Miolan,\" the delightful warbler, into the great singer with her  important place on the French stage.    But this was accomplished at a price. Madame Carvalho told me about it  herself. Her medium register was weak and Duprez undertook to  substitute chest tones and develop clearness as much as possible. \"When  I began to work,\" she said, \"my mother was frightened. One would have  thought that a calf was being killed in the house.\"    Ordinarily such a method would produce a harsh, shaky voice and all  freshness would be lost. But in Madame Carvalho's case the opposite was  true. The freshness and purity of her voice were beyond compare, while  its smoothness and the harmony of the registers were perfect. It was a  miracle the like of which we shall probably never see again.    But if Duprez made a wonderful voice at the risk of breaking it, I have  always thought that Madame Carvalho owed her admirable diction, so  distinguishing a mark of her talent, to Delsarte. Delsarte was a  disastrous and deadly teacher of singing. No voice could stand up under  his methods, not even his own, although he attributed its loss to  teaching at the Conservatoire. But he studied deeply the arts of  speaking and gesture, and he was a past master in them.    I once attended a course he gave in these subjects. He"]]]
