Why not at once?\"    \"Oh, but time to break our fast.\"    They looked at each other. The sergeant next considered the broad piece  of silver in his palm. Then at last his features relaxed from their  sternness.    \"After all,\" said he, \"it is none of our business to play the tipstaves  for M. de La Tour d'Azyr. We are of the marechaussee from Rennes.\"  Andre-Louis' eyelids played him false by flickering. \"But if you linger,  look out for the gardes-champetres of the Marquis. You'll find them not  at all accommodating. Well, well--a good appetite to you, monsieur,\" said  he, in valediction.    \"A pleasant ride, my captain,\" answered Andre-Louis.    The sergeant wheeled his horse about, his troop wheeled with him. They  were starting off, when he reined up again.    \"You, monsieur!\" he called over his shoulder. In a bound Andre-Louis was  beside his stirrup. \"We are in quest of a scoundrel named Andre-Louis  Moreau, from Gavrillac, a fugitive from justice wanted for the gallows  on a matter of sedition. You've seen nothing, I suppose, of a man whose  movements seemed to you suspicious?\"    \"Indeed, we have,\" said Andre-Louis, very boldly, his face eager with  consciousness of the ability to oblige.    \"You have?\" cried the sergeant, in a ringing voice. \"Where? When?\"    \"Yesterday evening in the neighbourhood of Guignen...\"    \"Yes, yes,\" the sergeant felt himself hot upon the trail.    \"There was a fellow who seemed very fearful of being recognized ... a  man of fifty or thereabouts...\"    \"Fifty!\" cried the sergeant, and his face fell. \"Bah! This man of ours  is no older than yourself, a thin wisp of a fellow of about your own  height and of black hair, just like your own, by the description. Keep a  lookout on your travels, master player. The King's Lieutenant in Rennes  has sent us word this morning that he will pay ten louis to any one  giving information that will lead to this scoundrel's arrest. So there's  ten louis to be earned by keeping your eyes open, and sending word to  the nearest justices. It would be a fine windfall for you, that.\"    \"A fine windfall, indeed, captain,\" answered Andre-Louis, laughing.    But the sergeant had touched his horse with the spur, and was already  trotting off in the wake of his men. Andre-Louis continued to laugh,  quite silently, as he sometimes did when the humour of a jest was  peculiarly keen.    Then he turned slowly about, and came back towards Pantaloon and the  rest of the company, who were now all grouped together, at gaze.    Pantaloon advanced to meet him with both hands out-held. For a moment  Andre-Louis thought he was about to be embraced.    \"We hail you our saviour!\" the big man declaimed. \"Already the shadow  of the gaol was creeping over us, chilling us to the very marrow. For  though we be poor, yet are we all honest folk and not one of us has ever  suffered the indignity of prison. Nor is there one of us would survive  it. But for you, my friend, it might have happened. What magic did you  work?\"    \"The magic that is to be worked in France with a King's portrait. The  French are a very loyal nation, as you will have observed. They love  their King--and his portrait even better than himself, especially when it  is wrought in gold. But even in silver it is respected. The sergeant  was so overcome by the sight of that noble visage--on a three-livre  piece--that his anger vanished, and he has gone his ways leaving us to  depart in peace.\"    \"Ah, true! He said we must decamp. About it, my lads! Come, come...\"    \"But not until after breakfast,\" said Andre-Louis. \"A half-hour for  breakfast was conceded us by that loyal fellow, so deeply was he  touched. True, he spoke of possible gardes-champetres. But he knows as  well as I do that they are not seriously to be feared, and that if  they came, again the King's portrait--wrought in copper this time--would  produce the same melting effect upon them. So, my dear M. Pantaloon,  break your fast at your ease. I can smell your cooking from here,  and from the smell I argue that there is no need to wish you a good  appetite.\"    \"My friend, my saviour!\" Pantaloon flung a great arm about the young  man's shoulders. \"You shall stay to breakfast with us.\"    \"I confess to a hope that you would ask me,\" said Andre-Louis.            CHAPTER II. THE SERVICE OF THESPIS    They were, thought Andre-Louis, as he sat down to breakfast with them  behind the itinerant house, in the bright sunshine that tempered the  cold breath of that November morning, an odd and yet an attractive crew.  An air of gaiety pervaded them. They affected to have no cares, and made  merry over the trials and tribulations of their nomadic life. They  were curiously, yet amiably, artificial; histrionic in their manner  of discharging the most commonplace of functions; exaggerated in their  gestures; stilted and affected in their speech. They seemed, indeed, to  belong to a world apart, a world of unreality which became real only  on the planks of their stage, in the glare of their footlights.  Good-fellowship bound them one to another; and Andre-Louis reflected  cynically that this harmony amongst them might be the cause of their  apparent unreality. In the real world, greedy striving and the emulation  of acquisitiveness preclude such amity as was present here.    They numbered exactly eleven, three women and eight men; and they  addressed each other by their stage names: names which denoted their  several types, and never--or only very slightly--varied, no matter what  might be the play that they performed.    \"We are,\" Pantaloon informed him, \"one of those few remaining staunch  bands of real players, who uphold the traditions of the old Italian  Commedia dell' Arte. Not for us to vex our memories and stultify our  wit with the stilted phrases that are the fruit of a wretched author's  lucubrations. Each of us is in detail his own author in a measure as he  develops the part assigned to him. We are improvisers--improvisers of the  old and noble Italian school.\"    \"I had guessed as much,\" said Andre-Louis, \"when I discovered you  rehearsing your improvisations.\"    Pantaloon frowned.    \"I have observed, young sir, that your humour inclines to the pungent,  not to say the acrid. It is very well. It is I suppose, the humour that  should go with such a countenance. But it may lead you astray, as  in this instance. That rehearsal--a most unusual thing with us--was  necessitated by the histrionic rawness of our Leandre. We are seeking  to inculcate into him by training an art with which Nature neglected to  endow him against his present needs. Should he continue to fail in doing  justice to our schooling... But we will not disturb our present harmony  with the unpleasant anticipation of misfortunes which we still hope  to avert. We love our Leandre, for all his faults. Let me make you  acquainted with our company.\"    And he proceeded to introduction in detail. He pointed out the long and  amiable Rhodomont, whom Andre-Louis already knew.    \"His length of limb and hooked nose were his superficial qualifications  to play roaring captains,\" Pantaloon explained. \"His lungs have  justified our choice. You should hear him roar. At first we called him  Spavento or Epouvapte. But that was unworthy of so great an artist. Not  since the superb Mondor amazed the world has so thrasonical a bully been  seen upon the stage. So we conferred upon him the name of Rhodomont  that Mondor made famous; and I give you my word, as an actor and a  gentleman--for I am a gentleman, monsieur, or was--that he has justified  us.\"    His little eyes beamed in his great swollen face as he turned their gaze  upon the object of his encomium. The terrible Rhodomont, confused by so  much praise, blushed like a schoolgirl as he met the solemn scrutiny of  Andre-Louis.    \"Then here we have Scaramouche, whom also you already know. Sometimes he  is Scapin and sometimes Coviello, but in the main Scaramouche, to which  let me tell you he is best suited--sometimes too well suited, I think.  For he is Scaramouche not only on the stage, but also in the world. He  has a gift of sly intrigue, an art of setting folk by the ears, combined  with an impudent aggressiveness upon occasion when he considers himself  safe from reprisals. He is Scaramouche, the little skirmisher, to the  very life. I could say more. But I am by disposition charitable and  loving to all mankind.\"    \"As the priest said when he kissed the serving-wench,\" snarled  Scaramouche, and went on eating.    \"His humour, like your own, you will observe, is acrid,\" said Pantaloon.  He passed on. \"Then that rascal with the lumpy nose and the grinning  bucolic countenance is, of course, Pierrot. Could he be aught else?\"    \"I could play lovers a deal better,\" said the rustic cherub.    \"That is the delusion proper to Pierrot,\" said Pantaloon,  contemptuously. \"This heavy, beetle-browed ruffian, who has grown old in  sin, and whose appetite increases with his years, is Polichinelle. Each  one, as you perceive, is designed by Nature for the part he plays. This  nimble, freckled jackanapes is Harlequin; not your spangled Harlequin  into which modern degeneracy has debased that first-born of Momus,  but the genuine original zany of the Commedia, ragged and patched, an  impudent, cowardly, blackguardly clown.\"    \"Each one of us, as you perceive,\" said Harlequin, mimicking the leader  of the troupe, \"is designed by Nature for the part he plays.\"    \"Physically, my friend, physically only, else we should not have so much  trouble in teaching this beautiful Leandre to become a lover. Then  we have Pasquariel here, who is sometimes an apothecary, sometimes a  notary, sometimes a lackey--an amiable, accommodating fellow. He is also  an excellent cook, being a child of Italy, that land of gluttons. And  finally, you have myself, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#19)"],[1,"aesthetic  feeling or of architectural fitness, and in the most religious spirit  committed acts of wholesale sacrilege. He employed, it is said, in the  work of restoration in the palace, the stones of the chapter-house, at  that time much injured, but certainly by no means ruined. He built a  hideous structure intended to support the central tower of the cathedral,  and as a crowning act of magnificent liberality, presented the church with  the most dreadful, ponderous, and unsuitable altar-piece that could well  have been devised. In an elaborate epitaph in the cathedral his virtues  are recorded. It was in the time of Bishop Bisse that the meeting of the  three choirs of Gloucester, Hereford, and Worcester first took place.    *Benjamin Hoadley*, A.D. 1721-1723, translated from Bangor, was again  translated to Salisbury early in 1723. His rule over Hereford was too  short for him to have influenced it for good or evil, and his history  belongs rather to Salisbury and Winchester.    *Hon. Henry Egerton*, A.D. 1723-1746, fifth son of the third Earl of  Bridgewater, was chaplain to George I. He is chiefly to be remembered for  an attempt to destroy the early Norman building adjoining the Bishop's  Palace, and thought to have been the parish church of St. Mary, each of  its two stories containing a chantry founded by Bishop Hugh Foliot.    *Lord James Beauclerk*, A.D. 1746-1787, grandson of Charles II. and Nell  Gwynn, a native of Hereford, was the next Bishop. It was during the last  year of his episcopate on Easter Monday, April 17, 1786, that occurred the  fall of the western tower of the cathedral, causing much injury. The west  front of the church was destroyed, and also a great part of the nave was  seriously injured. The Bishop died eighteen months after this calamity.  The see was next occupied for six weeks only by the Hon. J. Harley.    *John Butler*, A.D. 1788-1802. By birth a German, was an active political  supporter of the Government of the day.    He contributed largely to the repair of the cathedral.    *Folliott Herbert Cornewall*, A.D. 1802-1808. He was a member of an  ancient family in the county of Hereford. Translated from Bristol to  Hereford, he was again translated in 1808 to Worcester.    *John Luxmoore*, A.D. 1808-1815, was translated to Hereford from Bristol,  and again translated in 1815 to St. Asaph. He helped to establish national  schools in the diocese.    *Isaac Huntingford*, A.D. 1815-1832, warden of Winchester College, was  translated from Gloucester to Hereford, and still continued his duties at  Winchester. During his episcopate an incongruous painted window was placed  by Dean Carr at the east end of the choir in 1822. He was author of  several classical and theological works. He died April 29, 1832, in his  eighty-fourth year, and was buried at Compton, near Winchester. There is a  monument in the Bishop's cloister and a window in the south-east transept  to his memory.      [Illustration: A GARGOYLE IN THE CLOISTERS. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.]              A GARGOYLE IN THE CLOISTERS. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.      *Edward Grey, D.D.*, of Christ Church, Oxford, A.D. 1832-1837. He was Dean  of Hereford in 1831. He was buried in the choir of the cathedral, eastward  of the throne, on July 24, 1837, aged fifty-five years. A brass plate on  the wall marks the spot. There is also a monument to his memory now in the  Bishop's cloister.    *Thomas Musgrave, D.D.*, A.D. 1837-1847, Fellow of Trinity College,  Cambridge; Dean of Bristol; consecrated Bishop of Hereford, October 1,  1837; promoted to the Archbishopric of York, December, 1847. He died in  London, May 4, 1860, aged seventy-two years, and was buried at Kensal  Green, where there is a tomb with a short inscription. In York Minster a  monument in the shape of an altar tomb was erected to him, and in the  north choir aisle of Hereford Cathedral are three stained-glass windows to  his memory.

HUGH FISHER.      *Renn Dickson Hampden, D.D.*, A.D. 1848-1868, Fellow of Oriel College;  Principal of St. Mary's Hall; Regius Professor of Divinity; and Canon of  Christ Church, Oxford. He was appointed in 1847 by Lord John Russell, and  for the first time since the Reformation \"a struggle took place between  the recommending minister and a large and influential part of the clergy  and laity of the church, who regarded Dr. Hampden's opinions as  heretical.\"(11) Lord John Russell refused to withdraw the appointment, and  it was eventually carried out in spite of all remonstrances; not, however,  until the question had been taken from the Spiritual Court to the Court of  Queen's Bench, where the judges were equally divided in their opinion. He  died April 23, 1868, in London, and was buried at Kensal Green, close to  the Princess Sophia. His scholastic philosophy was said by Hallam to be  the only work of deep metaphysical research on the subject to be found in  the English language.               [Illustration: BYE STREET GATE. FROM AN OLD PRINT.]                       BYE STREET GATE. FROM AN OLD PRINT.      *James Atlay*, A.D. 1868-1895, second son of the Rev. Henry Atlay, M.A.,  formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. He was born July 3,  1817; graduated at St. John's College, Cambridge, of which he was  afterwards Fellow, appointed one of Her Majesty's Preachers at the Chapel  Royal, Whitehall, 1857; Vicar of Leeds, 1859; Canon of Ripon, 1861;  nominated to Hereford, May 9, consecrated at Westminster on June 24, and  enthroned in Hereford Cathedral, July 2, 1868. He was succeeded in 1895 by  the Right Rev. *John Percival*, D.D., the present holder of the see.
