Since the strongest of the fishes--persecute the weaker still,      Over us impends for ever--our inevitable fate.      Ere I sink, if thou wilt free me--from th' extremity of dread,      Meet return can I compensate--when the holy deed is done.\"      Speaking thus the fish when heard he--full of pity all his heart,      In his hand that fish king Manu--son of Vivaswata took.      Brought the son of Vivaswata--to the river shore the fish,      Cast it in a crystal vessel--like the moonshine clear and bright.      \"Rapid grew that fish, O raja--tended with such duteous care,      Cleaved to him the heart of Manu--as to a beloved son.      Time rolled on, and larger, larger--ever waxed that wonderous fish,      Nor within that crystal vessel--found he longer space to move.\"      Spake again the fish to Manu--as he saw him, thus he spake:      \"O all prosperous! O all gentle!--bring me to another place.\"      Then the fish from out the vessel--blessed Manu took again;      And with gentle speed he bare him,--Manu, to a spacious lake.      There the conqueror of cities,--mighty Manu, cast him in.      Still he grew, that fish so wondrous--many a circling round of years.      Three miles long that lake expanded--and a single mile its breadth,      Yet that fish with eyes like lotus--there no longer might endure;      Nor, O sovereign of the Vaisyas!--might that lake his bulk contain.      Spake again that fish to Manu--as he saw him, thus he spake:      \"Bring me now, O blest and holy!--to the Ganga, ocean's bride,      Let me dwell in her wide waters--yet, O loved one, as thou wilt,      Be it so; whate'er thy bidding,--murmur would beseem me ill,      Since through thee, O blest and blameless!--to this wondrous bulk I've          grown.\"      Thus addressed, the happy Manu--took again the fish, and bore      To the sacred stream of Ganga--and himself he cast him in.      Still it grew, as time rolled onward--tamer of thy foes! that fish.      Spake again that fish to Manu--as he saw him, thus he spake:      \"Mightiest! I can dwell no longer--here in Ganga's narrow stream;      Best of men! once more befriend me--bear me to the ocean swift.\"      Manu's self from Ganga's water--took again that wondrous fish,      And he brought him to the ocean,--with his own hand cast him in.      Brought by Manu to the ocean--very large that fish appeared,      But not yet of form unmeasured,--spread delicious odours round.      But that fish by kingly Manu--cast into the ocean wide,      In these words again bespake him--and he smiled as thus he spake:      \"Blessed! thou hast still preserved me--still my every wish fulfilled,      When the awful time approaches--hear from me what thou must do.      In a little time, O blessed!--all this firm and seated earth,      All that moves upon its surface--shall a deluge sweep away.      Near it comes, of all creation--the ablution day is near;      Therefore what I now forewarn thee--may thy highest weal secure.      All the fixed and all the moving--all that stirs, or stirreth not,      Lo, of all the time approaches--the tremendous time of doom.      Build thyself a ship, O Manu--strong, with cables well prepared,      And thyself, with the seven Sages--mighty Manu enter in.      All the living seeds of all things--by the Brahmins named of yore,      Place thou first within thy vessel--well secured, divided well.      From thy ship keep watch, O hermit--watch for me, as I draw near;      Horned shall I swim before thee--by my horn thou'lt know me well.      This the work thou must accomplish,--I depart; so fare thee well--      Over these tumultuous waters--none without mine aid can sail.      Doubt thou not, O lofty minded!--of my warning speech the truth.\"      To the fish thus answered Manu--\"All that thou requir'st, I'll do.\"      Thus they parted, of each other--mutual leave when they had ta'en,      Manu, raja! to accomplish--all to him the fish had said.      Taking first the seeds of all things--launched he forth upon the sea;      On the billowy sea, the prudent--in a beauteous vessel rode.      Manu of the fish bethought him;--conscious of his thought the fish,      Conqueror of hostile cities!--with his horn came floating by.      King of men, the born of Manu!--Manu saw the sea-borne fish,      In his form foreshewn, the horned--like a mountain huge and high.      To the fish's head his cable, Manu bound--O king of men!      Strong and firm his cable wound he--round and round on either horn:      And the fish, all conquering raja!--with that twisted cable bound,      With the utmost speed that vessel--dragged along the ocean tide.      In his bark along the ocean--boldly went the king of men:      Dancing with the tumbling billows--dashing through the roaring spray,      Tossed about by winds tumultuous--in the vast and heaving sea,      Like a trembling, drunken woman--reeled that ship, O king of men.      Earth was seen no more, no region--nor the intermediate space;      All around a waste of water--water all, and air and sky.      In the whole world of creation--princely son of Bharata!      None was seen but those seven Sages--Manu only, and the fish.      Years on years, and still unwearied--drew that fish the bark along,      Till at length it came, where lifted--Himavan its loftiest peak.      There at length it came, and smiling--thus the fish addressed the sage:      \"To the peak of Himalaya--bind thou now thy stately ship.\"      At the fish's mandate quickly--to the peak of Himavan      Bound the sage his bark, and ever--to this day that loftiest peak,      Bears the name of Manubandhan--from the binding of the bark.        To the sage, the god of mercy--thus with fixed look bespake:      \"I am lord of all creation--Brahma, higher than all height;      I in fishlike form have saved thee--Manu, in the perilous hour;      But from thee new tribes of creatures--gods, asuras, men must spring.      All the worlds must be created--all that moves or moveth not,      By an all-surpassing penance--this great work must be achieved.      Through my mercy, thy creation--to confusion ne'er shall run,\"      Spake the fish, and on the instant--to the invisible he passed.      Vivaswata's son, all eager--the creation to begin,      Stood amid his work confounded:--mighty penance wrought he then.      So fulfilled that rigorous penance--instant Manu 'gan create--      Instant every living creature--Raja! he began to form.        Such the old, the famous legend--named the story of the Fish,      Which to thee I have related--this for all our sins atones.      He that hears it, Manu's legend,--in the full possession he,      Of all things complete and perfect--to the heavenly world ascends.          NOTES ON NALA.      [Footnote 1: p. 3. l. 4. _Over, over all exalted_. This repetition is  in the original.]    [Footnote 2: p. 3. l. 5. _Holy deep-read in the Vedas_. All the  perfections, which, according to the opinions and laws of the Hindus,  distinguish the sovereign from the rest of mankind, are here ascribed  to the hero of the poem. The study of the Vedas must be cultivated by  the three superior castes, and ensures both temporal and eternal  beatitude. In the laws of Menu it is said, \"Greatness is not conferred  by years, not by grey hairs, not by wealth, not by powerful kindred.\"  The divine sages have established this rule--Whoever has read the  Vedas and their Angas, he is among us great. (JONES'S MENU, ii. 254).  Of all these duties, answered Bhrigu, the principal is to acquire from  the Upanishads a true knowledge of the one supreme God: that is the  most exalted of all sciences, because it ensures immortality, (xii.  85). For in the knowledge and adoration of one God, which the Veda  teaches, all the rules of good conduct before-mentioned in order, are  fully comprised, (ib. 87.)    The study of the Vedas is considered the peculiar duty of kings, (vii.  43). The Upanishads are doctrinal extracts of the Vedas.    The Indian law demands in the most rigorous manner from every one of  noble birth, the mastery over the _senses_. Menu says, c. ii. 93, \"A  man by the attachment of his organs to sensual pleasure, incurs  certain guilt; but having wholly subdued them, he thence attains  heavenly bliss. v. 94. Desire is never satisfied with the enjoyment of  desired objects; as the fire is not appeased with clarified butter; it  only blazes more vehemently. v. 97. To a man contaminated by  sensuality, neither the Vedas, nor liberality, nor sacrifices, nor  strict observances, nor pious austerities, ever procure felicity.\" The  control over every kind of sensual indulgence is enjoined upon the  king. vii. 44. Day and night must he strenuously exert himself to gain  complete victory over his own organs; since that king alone whose  organs are completely subdued, can keep his people firm to their duty.    Skill in the management of horses and chariots, which in a subsequent  part of the poem is of great importance to Nala, is often mentioned as  a praiseworthy accomplishment of kings. In the Ramayana, for instance,  in the description of king Dasaratha, which likewise contains the  above-mentioned traits of character--\"In this city Ayodhya was a king  named Dusharutha, descended from Ikshwaku, perfectly skilled in the  Veda and Vedangas, prescient, of great ability, beloved by all his  people, a great charioteer, constant in sacrifice, eminent in sacred  duties, a royal sage, nearly equalling a Muhurshi, famed throughout  the three worlds, mighty, triumphant over his enemies, observant of  justice, having a perfect command of his appetites.\" CAREY and  MARSHMAN'S translation, sect. vi. p. 64.]    [Footnote 3: p. 3. l. 5. _--in Nishadha lord of earth_. I have accented  this word not quite correctly Nishadha, in order to harmonise with the  trochaic flow of my metre. It appears to be the same as Nishadha-ras"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#19)"],[1,"well the stern command from the caress, forbidding  from allowing, in the voice of the person speaking to him. Yet it is  much more the _timbre_, the accent, the pitch, the intensity of the  voice and the sounds, the variation of which excites attention, than it  is the spoken word. In the first half-year the child hears the vowels  much better than he does the consonants, and will imperfectly  understand or divine the sense of a few sounds only--e. g., when his  name is uttered in a threatening tone he will hear merely the accented  vowel, for at the first performance taught him, purposely postponed to a  very late period (in his thirteenth month), it made no difference to my  child whether we asked without changing a feature, \"Wie gross?\" (how  tall?) or \"ooss?\" or \"oo?\" In all three cases he answered with the same  movement of the hand.    Now, although all infants in normal condition, before they can repeat  anything after others or can understand any word whatever, _express_  their feelings by various sounds, even by syllables, and _distinguish_  vowels and many consonants in the words spoken to them, yet this does  not raise them above the intelligent animal. The response to friendly  address and loud chiding by appropriate sounds is scarcely to be  distinguished as to its psychical value from the joyous barking and  whining of the poodle.    The pointer-dog's understanding of the few spoken utterances that are  impressed upon him in his training is also quite as certain at least  as the babe's understanding of the jargon of the nurse. The correctly  executed movements or arrests of movement following the  sound-impressions \"Setz dich! Pfui! Zurueck! Vorwaerts! Allez! Fass!  Apporte! Such! Verloren! Pst! Lass! Hierher! Brav! Leid's nicht!  Ruhig! Wahr Dich! Hab Acht! Was ist das! Pfui Vogel! Pfui Hase! Halt!\"  prove that the bird-dog understands the meaning of the sounds and  syllables and words heard as far as he needs to understand them. The  training in the English language accomplishes the same result with  \"Down! Down charge! Steady! Toho! Fetch! Hold up!\" as the training in  the French language, with yet other words--so that we can by no means  assume any hereditary connection whatever between the quality of the  sound heard and the movement or arrest of movement to be executed,  such as may perhaps exist in the case of the chick just hatched which  follows the clucking of the hen. Rather does the dog learn afresh in  every case the meaning of the words required for hunting, just as the  speechless child comprehends the meaning of the first words of its  future language without being able to repeat them himself--e. g.,  \"Give! Come! Hand! Sh! Quiet!\" Long before the child's mechanism of  articulation is so far developed that these expressions can be  produced by him, the child manifests his understanding of them  unequivocally by corresponding movements, by gestures and looks, by  obedience.    No doubt this behavior varies in individual cases, inasmuch as in some  few the imitative articulation may be to some extent earlier developed  than the understanding. There are many children who even in their first  year have a monkey-like knack at imitation and repeat all sorts of  things like parrots without guessing the sense of them. Here, however,  it is to be borne in mind that such an echo-speech appears only after  the _first_ understanding of some spoken word can be demonstrated; in no  case before the fourth month. Lindner relates that when he one day  observed that his child of eighteen weeks was gazing at the swinging  pendulum of the house-clock, he went with him to it, saying,  \"Tick-tack,\" in time with the pendulum; and when he afterward called  out to the child, who was no longer looking at the clock, \"Tick-tack!\"  this call was answered, at first with delay, a little later immediately,  by a turning of the look toward the clock. This proved that there was  understanding long before the first imitation of words. Progress now  became pretty rapid, so that at the end of the seventh month the  questions, \"Where is your eye? ear? head? mouth? nose? the table? chair?  sofa?\" were answered correctly by movements of hand and eyes. In the  tenth month this child for the first time himself used a word as a means  of effecting an understanding, viz., _mama_ (soon afterward, indeed, he  called both parents _papa_). The child's inability to repeat distinctly  syllables spoken for him is not to be attributed, shortly before the  time at which he succeeds in doing it, to a purely psychical adynamy  (impotence), not, as many suppose, to \"being stupid,\" or to a weakness  of will without organic imperfections determined by the cerebral  development, for the efforts, the attention, and the ability to repeat  incorrectly, show that the will is not wanting. Since also the  peripheral impressive acoustic and expressive phonetic paths are intact  and developed, as is proved by the acuteness of the hearing and the  spontaneous formation of the very syllables desired, the cause of the  inability to repeat correctly must be solely organic-centro-motor. The  connecting paths between the sound-center and the syllable-center, and  of both these with the speech motorium, are not yet or not easily  passable; but the imitation of a single sound, be it only _a_, can not  take place without the mediation of the cerebral cortex. Thus in the  very first attempt to repeat something heard there exists an  unquestionable advance in brain development; and the first successful  attempt of this kind proves not merely the augmented functional ability  of the articulatory apparatus and of the sound-center, and the  practicability of the impressive paths that lead from the ear to the  sound-center--it proves, above all, the establishment of intercentral  routes that lead from the sound-center and the syllable-center to the  motorium.    In fact, the correct _repeating_ of a sound heard, of a syllable, and,  finally, of a word pronounced by another person, is the surest proof of  the establishment and practicability of the entire impressive, central,  and expressive path. It, however, proves nothing as to the  _understanding_ of the sound or word heard and faultlessly repeated.    As the term \"understanding\" or \"understand\" is ambiguous, in so far  as it may relate to the ideal content (the meaning), and at the same  time to the mere perception of the word spoken (or written or  touched)--e. g., when any one speaks indistinctly so that we do not  \"understand\" him--it is advisable to restrict the use of this  expression. _Understand_ shall in future apply only to the _meaning_  of the word; _hear_--since it is simply the perceiving of a word  through the hearing that we have in view--will relate to the sensuous  impression. It is clear, then, that all children who can hear but can  not yet speak, repeat many words without understanding them, and  understand many words without being able to repeat them, as Kussmaul  has already observed. But I must add that the repeating of what is  not understood begins only after some word (even one that can not be  repeated) has been understood.    Now it is certain that the majority, if not all, of the children  that have good hearing develop the understanding more at first,  since the impressive side is practiced more and sooner than the  expressive-articulatory. Probably those that imitate early and  skillfully are the children that can speak earliest, and whose  cerebrum grows fastest but also soonest ceases to grow; whereas those  that imitate later and more sparingly, generally learn to speak later,  and will generally be the more intelligent. For with the higher sort  of activity goes the greater growth of brain. While the other children  cultivate more the centro-motor portion, the sensory, the  intellectual, is neglected. In animals, likewise, a brief, rapid  development of the brain is wont to go along with inferior  intelligence. The intelligence gets a better development when the  child, instead of repeating all sorts of things without any meaning,  tries to guess the meaning of what he hears. Precisely the epoch at  which this takes place belongs to the most interesting in intellectual  development. Like a pantomimist, the child, by means of his looks and  gestures, and further by cries and by movements of all sorts, gives  abundant evidence of his understanding and his desires, without  himself speaking a single word. As the adult, after having half  learned a foreign language from books, can not speak (imitate) it, and  can not easily understand it when he hears it spoken fluently by one  that is a perfect master of it, but yet makes out _single_ expressions  and understands them, and divines the meaning of the whole, so the  child at this stage can distinctly hear single words, can grasp the  purport of them, and divine correctly a whole sentence from the looks  and gestures of the speaker, although the child himself makes audible  no articulate utterance except his own, for the most part meaningless,  variable babble of sounds and syllables and outcries.    The causes of the slowness of the progress in expressing in articulate  words what is understood and desired, on the part of normal children, is  not, however, to be attributed, as it has often been, to a slower  development of the expressive motor mechanism, but must be looked for in  the difficulty of establishing the connection of the various central  storehouses of sense-impressions with the intercentral path of  connection between the acoustic speech-centers and the speech-motorium.  For the purely peripheral articulatory acts are long since perfect,  although as yet a simple \"_a_\" or \"_pa_\" can not be repeated after  another person; for these and other sounds and syllables are already  uttered correctly by the child himself.    The order of succession in which these separate sounds appear, without  instruction, is very "]]]
