There were colonial governments; but they were such as the king  was pleased to establish, and might be changed at his pleasure. These  governments were in _form_ somewhat similar to that of our state  governments. There was what might be called a legislature; also an  executive or governor; and there were judges.    Sec.5. But of the officers of these departments of the government, only the  members of one branch of the law-making power were elected by the  people. The other branch was composed of a small number of men, called a  council; but they were appointed by the king and subject to his control,  as was also the governor, who had the power of an absolute negative or  veto to any proposed law. And laws after having received the assent of  the governor, must be sent to England and approved by the king, before  they could go into effect.    Sec.6. Hence we see that the colonists had no security for the passage of  such laws as they wanted. And the consequence was, that they were often  denied good and wholesome laws, by the refusal of the king to sanction  them. Not only so; many laws enacted by parliament were very unjust and  oppressive. The object of these laws was to secure to Great Britain  alone the trade of the colonies. One law declared that no goods should  be imported by the colonists but in English vessels; if brought in  other vessels, both the goods and vessels were to be forfeited to the  British government.    Sec.7. Another law required such articles as England wanted, to be  transported to that country and other countries belonging to Great  Britain. The colonists were permitted to ship to foreign markets such  products only as English merchants did not want. They were prohibited  from selling abroad any wool, yarn, or woolen manufactured goods. This  was done to keep the markets open for British wool and manufactures.  Another law declared that no iron wares of any kind should be  manufactured here. Thus was it attempted to suppress manufactures in the  colonies.    Sec.8. Hence we see that it was the policy of the British government to  compel the colonists to buy of England all the goods they wanted which  they did not themselves produce, and to sell to England the surplus  productions of the colonies. For this purpose, heavy duties were laid  upon goods imported into the colonies from other countries than Great  Britain and her possessions. These duties were taxes levied upon goods  brought into the colonies from abroad, and were collected by officers  here from the persons importing the goods.    Sec.9. The following facts will explain to the young reader more clearly  the nature and effects of these duties: The colonists traded with the  West India islands, some of which belonged to Great Britain, some to  France, and some to Spain. To secure the whole trade, the British  government imposed high duties upon the molasses, sugar and other  articles imported into the colonies from the French and Spanish islands.  The people of the colonies could therefore avoid the payment of these  duties only by importing the above mentioned goods from the British  islands.    Sec.10. Not satisfied with these acts, parliament claimed the right to tax  the colonies, \"in all cases whatsoever;\" and an act was passed  accordingly, laying duties upon all tea, glass, paper, &c., imported  into the colonies; and the money thus collected was put into the British  treasury. The colonists petitioned the king and parliament to repeal  these obnoxious laws; but their petitions were denied. Having given up  all hope of relief, congress, which was a body of delegates from the  several colonies, declared the colonies to be free and independent  states, no longer subject to the government of Great Britain. This  declaration was maintained by a war which lasted about seven years, when  Great Britain gave up the contest, and acknowledged the independence of  the states; and the _revolution_ was accomplished.          Chapter XXVII.    Nature of the Union under the Confederation.        Sec.1. As early as the year 1774, the colonies united in the plan of a  congress, to be composed of delegates chosen in all the colonies, for  the purpose of consulting on the common good and of adopting measures of  resistance to the claims of the British government. The first great  continental congress met on the 4th of September, 1774. Another congress  assembled in May, 1775. This congress adopted sundry measures having  reference to war, and finally made the declaration of independence, July  4th, 1776. The continental congress, the members of which were chosen by  the state legislatures, conducted the affairs of the nation until near  the close of the war.    Sec.2. With a view to a permanent union of the colonies under a general  government, the congress, in November, 1777, agreed upon a frame of  government, contained in certain articles, called, \"Articles of  Confederation and perpetual Union between the States.\" These articles  were to go into effect when they should have received the assent of all  the states. But as the consent of the last state (Maryland) was not  obtained until March, 1781, they went into operation only about two  years before the close of the war.    Sec.3. As a plan of national government, the confederation was soon found  to be very defective. The union formed under it was a very imperfect  one. Having been framed in time of war, it had respect to the operations  of war rather than to a state of peace. Although it answered some good  purpose in carrying on the war, it was not well adapted oven to the  condition of the country then existing. Its defects appeared almost as  soon as it went into effect; and after the return of peace, it was found  that the union, instead of being strengthened and perpetuated by it,  could be preserved only by a radical change in the system of government.    Sec.4. The leading defect of the confederation was its weakness. Congress  could do little more than to recommend measures. As it could not  legislate directly upon persons, its measures were to be carried into  effect by the states; but the states were not in all cases willing, and  some of them did at times refuse to do so, and congress could not compel  them. It belonged to congress to determine the number of troops and the  sums of money necessary to carry on the war, and to call on each state  to raise its share; but congress could not enforce its demands. It  borrowed money in its own name, but it had not the means of paying it.  It had no power to lay and collect taxes; this power was reserved to the  states.    Sec.5. Hence we see that congress was dependent for every thing upon the  good will of thirteen independent states. It is a wonder that a  government of such inherent weakness should bring the war to a  successful issue. It was a sense of danger from abroad, rather than any  power in the government, that induced a sufficient compliance with the  ordinances of congress to achieve the independence of the states.    Sec.6. On the restoration of peace, new difficulties arose. We have already  spoken of the want of power in congress to lay and collect taxes for  war purposes. Money was now wanted to discharge the public debt, and to  pay the current expenses of the government; yet congress had no power to  raise it, either by a _direct tax_ upon the persons or property of the  citizens, or _indirectly_ by duties on goods imported, as at present  under the constitution. The power to lay and collect duties was with the  states; but it was of little use so long as each state could impose such  duties as it chose. The states being unable to agree upon a uniform rate  of duties, the goods would be imported into states which levied the  lowest duties. It was expedient, if it had been possible, to borrow more  money on the credit of the union, as the heavy debt contracted during  the war remained unpaid, and congress had no means of paying it.    Sec.7. But the inability to raise money was not the only difficulty that  attended the want of power by congress to lay duties. This power was  necessary also to regulate the foreign trade. We have already remarked,  that it was the policy of Great Britain before the revolution to secure  in the colonies a market for her manufactures. (Chap. XXVI.) Not only  so; she had by her navigation acts, for more than a hundred years,  imposed heavy duties upon foreign vessels coming into her ports, in  order to secure the carrying trade to her own shipping. In addition to  this, she also levied high duties upon the produce of the states sent to  pay for the goods we were obliged to buy of her, our own people not  having as yet the means, nor having had time, to establish  manufactories, and to manufacture for themselves.    Sec.8. Another of the numerous troubles which arose from this imperfect  union was the want of peace and harmony between the states. Laws were  enacted in some states with a view to their own interests, which  operated injuriously upon other states. This induced the latter states  to retaliate, by passing laws partial to themselves and injurious to the  former. The states soon became disaffected toward each other; and their  mutual jealousies and rivalries and animosities at length became so  great as to cause fears that some of the states would become involved  in war among themselves, and that the union would be broken up.    Sec.9. In the hope of remedying the difficulty last mentioned, an attempt  was made to procure the insertion, into the articles of confederation,  of a provision giving to congress the power to regulate trade; but the  attempt failed. In January, 1786, the legislature of Virginia proposed a  convention of commissioners from all the states, to take into  consideration the situation and trade of the United States, and the  necessity "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#19)"],[1," boomed and crashed in deepening peals over the hills.    In a sudden tropical torrent the rain descended, and I stepped forward  into the room. Its occupant rose to his great height to greet me.    \"I am Dr. Damar Greefe,\" he said, and bowed formally.    I made myself known to him in turn, and with a sort of stately  courtesy he set a high-backed chair for me and himself resumed his  former seat.    \"You are a stranger to this neighborhood, I gather?\" he continued.    Now, in spite of his polished courtesy, there was that about Dr. Damar  Greefe which I did not and could not like. The voice was the voice of  a gentleman, but the face was a mask--a mask of Anubis; and seated  there in that strange untidy apartment, amid varied relics of the past  and obscure experiments possibly designed to pry into the future,  whilst thunder boomed high over the Bell House, I determined to  withhold from Dr. Damar Greefe the true nature of my mission. In fact  already I regretted having told him my name--although to have given a  fictitious one would have been a gross violation of hospitality  unhesitatingly offered.    Even now I find it hard to explain the mingled sentiments which  claimed me on the occasion of this my first meeting with a very  singular man.    \"I am taking a brief rest cure,\" I replied; \"and as I am given to  understand that Friar's Park is of much historical interest, I had  purposed seeking permission to look over the place and if possible to  take a few photographs.\"    Dr. Damar Greefe inclined his head gravely.    \"A former monastic house, Mr. Addison,\" he replied. \"And as you say,  of great archaeological interest. But the regrettably poor health of  Lady Coverly makes it impossible for her to entertain visitors.\"    Something in the tone of his voice, which now he had lowered so that  some of its natural harshness was disguised, set me wondering where I  had heard it before. It needed no further scrutiny of the hawk face to  convince me that I had never hitherto met Dr. Damar Greefe; but I  certainly believed that I had previously heard his voice, although I  quite failed to recall where and under what circumstances.    \"Sir Burnham has been dead for several years, I believe?\" I asked  tentatively.    \"For several years, yes.\"    Without returning to the peremptory tone which had distinguished his  earlier manner, Dr. Damar Greefe coldly but courteously blocked my  path to discussion of the Coverly family; and after several abortive  attempts to draw him out upon the point, I recognized this deliberate  design and abandoned the matter.    The storm was moving westward, and although brilliant flashes of  lightning several times lighted up the queer room, gleaming upon the  gayly-painted lid of an Egyptian sarcophagus or throwing into horrid  relief some anatomical specimen in one of the cases, the thunder  crashed no more over the house. But its booming reached my ears from  away upon a remote spur of the hills. I became aware of a growing  uneasiness in the company of my chance host, who sat by the oddly  littered table, watching me with those birdlike eyes.    \"Surely,\" I said, \"the rain has ceased?\"    \"Temporarily,\" he replied, glancing toward the terrace. \"But I should  advise you to delay a few minutes longer. There is every threat of a  concluding downpour to come ere long.\"    \"Many thanks,\" I returned; \"I'll risk it. I have already trespassed  unwarrantably upon your time, Dr. Greefe. It was good of you to give  me shelter.\"    He rose, a tall thin figure, vaguely repellent, upon realizing that I  was set on departure, and conducted me out by way of the front door.  Standing in the porch:    \"At any time that you chance to be again in my neighborhood, Mr.  Addison,\" he said, \"I beg of you to call. I have few visitors.\"    By what process, whether of reasoning or intuition, I came to the  conclusion, I know not; but as I turned the bend of the tree-roofed  drive and saw the deserted lodge ahead, I knew beyond any possibility  of doubt that Dr. Damar Greefe had not returned to his studies, but  had swiftly passed along some path through the trees so as to head me  off! His purpose in so doing I knew not, but that he had cherished  this purpose and proposed to act upon it I had divined in some way at  the moment that I had left him in the porch.    Now, hastening my steps, I began to wonder if his design was to  intercept me or merely to watch which way I should turn on gaining the  main road. That it was the latter I presently learned; for although my  unpleasant imagination pictured the gaunt hawk-like figure lurking  amid the shadows which hemmed me in, I played the part of innocence  and never once looked back.    Coming out into the highroad, I turned sharply left, retracing the  route by which I had come to the Eurasian doctor's abode. If he had  suspected that I had intended to call at Friar's Park despite his  assurance that such a visit would prove futile, then he was  disappointed. A new and strange theory to account for \"the _Oritoga_  mystery\" had presented itself to me--a horrible theory, yet, so far as  my present data went, a feasible one. Above all, I realized that I had  committed a strategical error in openly seeking an interview with Lady  Coverly. But I had not, when I had formed that plan, known of the  existence of Dr. Damar Greefe.    I uttered a sigh of relief upon emerging upon the highroad. The  certainty that the white-haired Eurasian was dogging me through the  trees was an unpleasant one. And now I perceived that several courses  presented themselves; but first I must obtain more information. I  perceived a mystery within a mystery; for I was not likely to forget  that in Dr. Damar Greefe's collection I had noted a number of  _Bubastite cats_.          CHAPTER XIV    THE BLACK DOCTOR      My mail, neatly readdressed by Coates, was awaiting me when I returned  to the Abbey Inn. The postal deliveries in Upper Crossleys were  eccentric and unreliable, but having glanced through the cuttings  enclosed, I partook of a hasty lunch and sat down to the task of  preparing a column for the _Planet_ which should not deflect public  interest from the known central figures in the tragedy but which at  the same time should hint at new developments.    Many times in the intervals of writing I glanced through my open  window across the valley to where the upstanding wing of Friar's Park  jutted above the trees. Strange and terrible ideas flocked to my  mind--ideas which must be carefully excluded from the _Planet_  article. But at last the manuscript was completed and I determined to  walk into the neighboring town, some miles distant, to post it and at  the same time to despatch a code telegram to Inspector Gatton. The  long walk did me good, helping me to clear my mind of morbid vapors;  therefore, my business finished, and immune from suspicion in my  character of a London pedestrian, I set out to obtain that vital  information which I lacked.    A natural taciturnity rendered mine host of the Abbey Inn a difficult  subject for interrogation. Moreover that patriarchal outlook which had  been evidenced in his attitude towards the uncouth Edward Hines  clearly enough deterred him from imparting to me any facts detrimental  to the good name of Upper Crossleys. But on the highroad and just  before entering the outskirts of the little country town, I had  observed an inn which had seemed to be well patronized by the local  folks, and since your typical country tap-room is a clearing-house for  the gossip of the neighborhood, to \"The Threshers\" I made my way.    The doors had only just been opened; nevertheless as I set my foot  upon the step I met the very gossip that I sought.    \"Hope you wasn't caught in the shower, this morning, sir?\" said an old  man seated solitary in an armchair in the corner of the bar-parlor.  \"But the country'll be all the better for the rain.\" He eyed me, and:  \"There's many a fine walk hereabouts,\" he averred. \"There's lots  comes down from London, especially of a Sunday.\"    \"No doubt,\" said I encouragingly, stepping up to the counter.    \"There's Manton-on-the-Hill,\" continued the ancient. \"You can see the  sea from there in clear weather; and many's the time in the war I've  heard the guns in France from Upper Crowbury of a still night. Then,  four mile away, there's the old Friar's Park; though nobody's allowed  past the gate. Not as nobody wants to be,\" he added reflectively.    \"How is that? I understood that Friar's Park was of great interest.\"    \"Oh, ah!\" murmured my acquaintance. \"Oh, ah! Maybe you was thinkin' of  lookin' over it like?\"    \"I was--yes.\"    \"Oh, ah! Well--there's some likes a bit o' danger.\"    \"Danger?\" I echoed. \"To what danger do you refer?\"    He surveyed me with cunning, old rheumy eyes, and:    \"What about man-traps?\" he inquired. \"Ain't man-traps dangerous? And  what about shot-guns? Shot-guns can make a party feel sick, can't  they? Oh, ah!\"    \"But,\" I exclaimed, \"you surely don't mean that there are traps laid  in the grounds of the Park? It isn't legal. And why should any one  shoot at visitors?\"    \"Maybe 'cause they're told to,\" he shouted. \"Aye--that's the reason as  like as not; 'cause they're told to.\"    \"Who are 'they'?\"    \"Old Gipsy Hawkins as used to be Sir Burnham's under-keeper. What's he  doin' of up there at Park all day? Layin' traps and such--that's what  he's doin' of. My son Jim knows it, he do. My son Jim found one of  'em--and left best part of a pair of trousers in it, too!\"    These statements if true would seem to cast an unpleasant sidelight  upon the character of my acquaintance of the Abbey Inn. I wondered if  the \"Jim\" referred to was that \"young Jim Corder\" whose name seemed  to be a standing joke with the man Hawkins (I learned later that it  was so). And I wondered if Martin's mysterious references to certain  patrons, whose patronage had damaged his business, might not have  referred "]]]
