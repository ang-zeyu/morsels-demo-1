In the third place, I note with sincere regret that in discussing the  sale and exportation of arms by citizens of the United States to the  enemies of Germany, your Excellency seems to be under the impression  that it was within the choice of the Government of the United States,  notwithstanding its professed neutrality and its diligent efforts to  maintain it in other particulars, to inhibit this trade, and that its  failure to do so manifested an unfair attitude toward Germany.    This Government holds, as I believe your Excellency is aware and as it  is constrained to hold in view of the present indisputable doctrines of  accepted international law, that any change in its own laws of  neutrality during the progress of a war, which would affect unequally  the relations of the United States with the nations at war, would be an  unjustifiable departure from the principle of strict neutrality, by  which it has consistently sought to direct its actions, and I  respectfully submit that none of the circumstances, urged in your  Excellency's memorandum, alters the principle involved.    The placing of an embargo on the trade in arms at the present time would  constitute such a change and be a direct violation of the neutrality of  the United States. It will, I feel assured, be clear to your Excellency  that holding this view and considering itself in honor bound by it, it  is out of the question for this Government to consider such a course.    I hope that your Excellency will realize the spirit in which I am  drafting this reply. The friendship between the people of the United  States and the people of Germany is so warm and of such long standing,  the ties which bind them to one another in amity are so many and so  strong, that this Government feels under a special compulsion to speak  with perfect frankness, when any occasion arises which seems likely to  create any misunderstanding, however slight or temporary, between those  who represent the Governments of the two countries.    It will be a matter of gratification to me if I have removed from your  Excellency's mind any misapprehension you may have been under regarding  either the policy or the spirit and purposes of the Government of the  United States.    Its neutrality is founded upon the firm basis of conscience and  good-will.    Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.    W.J. BRYAN.          Munitions From Neutrals    [Colloquy in the House of Commons, May 4, 1915.]      Sir E. Grey, in reply to Sir A. Markham, (L., Mansfield,) said: The  United States Government have not at any time during the present war  supplied any war material of any kind to his Majesty's Government, and I  do not suppose that they have supplied any of the belligerents. It has  always been a recognized legitimate practice, and wholly consistent with  international law, for manufacturers in a neutral country to sell  munitions of war to belligerents. They were supplied in this way from  Germany to Russia during the Russo-Japanese war, and from Germany to  Great Britain during the Boer war, and are no doubt being supplied in  the same way from manufacturers in neutral countries to belligerents  now.    Mr. MacNeill (N., South Donegal)--Has not the rule always been, before  The Hague Conferences at all, that subjects of neutral nations are  allowed to supply munitions of war at their own risk?    Sir E. Grey--It is wholly consistent with international law that that  practice should go forward, and if there be any question of departure  from neutrality I think it will be, not in permitting that practice, but  in interfering with it. [Cheers.]          Germany and the Lusitania    By Charles W. Eliot    _President Emeritus of Harvard University._           That the sinking of the Lusitania was an act which outraged       not only the existing conventions of the civilized world but       the moral feelings of present civilized society is the view       put forth in his letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, appearing May       15, 1915, by one of the most distinguished commentators on the       war. Dr. Eliot counsels that America's part is to resist such       a no-faith policy while keeping its neutral status.    Cambridge, Mass., May 13, 1915.    _To the Editor of The New York Times:_    The sinking of a great merchant vessel, carrying 2,500 noncombatant men,  women, and children, without giving them any chance to save their lives,  was in violation of long-standing conventions among civilized nations,  concerning the conduct of naval warfare. The pre-existing conventions  gave to a German vessel of war the right to destroy the Lusitania and  her cargo, if it were impossible to carry her into port as a prize; but  not to drown her passengers and crew. The pre-existing conventions or  agreements were, however, entered into by the civilized nations when  captures at sea were made by war vessels competent to take a prize into  some port, or to take off the passengers and crew of the captured  vessel.    The German Government now alleges that submarines are today the only  vessels it can employ effectively for attack on British commerce in the  declared war zone about the British Isles, since the rest of the German  Navy cannot keep the seas in face of the superior British Navy. Germany  further alleges that the present British blockade of German ports is  conducted in a new way--that is, by vessels which patrol the German  coast at a greater distance from the actual harbors than was formerly  the international practice; and hence, that Germany is justified in  conducting her attack on British commerce in a novel way also. In short,  Germany argues that her military necessities compel her to sink enemy  commercial vessels without regard to the lives of passengers and crews,  in spite of the fact that she was party to international agreements that  no such act should be committed.    The lesson which the sinking of the Lusitania teaches is, therefore,  this: Germany thinks it right to disregard on grounds of military  necessity existing international conventions with regard to naval  warfare, precisely as she disregarded the agreed-upon neutrality of  Belgium on the ground of military necessity. As in the case of Belgium  she had decided many years beforehand to violate the international  neutrality agreement, and had made all her plans for reaching Paris in a  few weeks by passing through Belgium, so on the sea she had decided  months ago that the necessity of interfering as much as possible with  British commerce and industries warrants her total disregard of the  existing rules of naval warfare, and has deliberately contrived the  sinking of merchant vessels without regard to the lives of the people on  board.    Again, when Germany thought it necessary on her quick march toward Paris  not only to crush the Belgian Army but to terrify the noncombatant  population of Belgium into complete submission by bombarding and burning  cities, towns, and villages, by plundering and shooting noncombatants,  by imposing heavy fines and ransoms, and by holding noncombatants as  hostages for the peaceable behavior of all Belgian citizens, she  disregarded all the conventions made by the civilized nations within  seventy years for mitigating the horrors of war, and justified her  action on the ground that it was a military necessity, since in no other  way could she immediately secure the safety of her communications as  she rushed on Paris. The civilized world had supposed that each nation  would make war only on the public forces and resources of its  antagonist; but last August Germany made ferocious war on noncombatants  and private property.    The sinking of the Lusitania is another demonstration that the present  German Government will not abide by any international contracts,  treaties, or agreements, if they, at a given moment, would interfere  with any military or naval course of action which the Government deems  necessary.    These demonstrated policies and purposes of the German Empire raise the  fundamental question--how is the civilization of the white race to be  carried forward? How are the real welfare of that race and the happiness  of the individuals that compose it to be hereafter furthered? Since the  revolutions in England, America, and France, it has been supposed that  civilization was to be advanced by international agreements or treaties,  by the co-operation of the civilized nations in the gradual improvement  of these agreements, and by the increasing practical effect given to  them by nations acting in co-operation; but now comes the German Empire  with its military force, immense in numbers and efficient beyond all  former experience through the intelligent use for destructive purposes  of the new powers attained by applied science, saying not only in words,  but in terrible acts: \"We shall not abide by any international contracts  or agreements into which we may have previously entered, if at the  passing moment they interfere or conflict with the most advantageous  immediate use of our military and naval force.\" If this doctrine shall  now prevail in Europe, the foundations of modern civilization and of all  friendly and beneficial commerce the world over will be undermined.    The sinking of the Lusitania, therefore, makes perfectly clear the  nature of the problem with which the three Allies in Europe are now  struggling. They are resisting with all the weapons of war a nation  which declares that its promises are good only till it is, in its own  judgment, under the military necessity of breaking them.    The neutral nations are looking on at this tremendous conflict between  good-faith nations and no-faith nations with intense anxiety and sorrow,  but no longer in any doubt as to the nature of the issue.

Notes:    1. This is a slip, probably due to the printer's reader. There are no  chimney-sweepers in India. The word should be 'sweepers'. The members  of this caste and a few other degraded communities, such as the Doms,  do all the sweeping, scavenging, and conservancy work in India.  'Washerwomen' is another slip: read 'Washermen'.    2. The 'under-woman', or 'second ayah', was a member of the sweeper  caste.    3. The title Mir Sahib implies that Salamat Ali was a Sayyid,  claiming descent from Ali, the cousin, son-in-law, and pupil of  Muhammad, who became Khalif  in A.D. 656.    4. The sweeper castes stand outside the Hindoo pale, and often  incline to Muhammadan practices. They worship a special form of the  Deity, under the names of Lal Beg, Lal Guru, &c.    5. No _avatar_ or incarnation of Brahma is known to most Hindoos, and  incarnations of Siva are rarely mentioned. The only _avatars_  ordinarily recognized are those of Vishnu, as enumerated ante.  Chapter 2, note 4.    6. This theory is a very inadequate explanation of the doctrine of  _avatars_.    7. 'Women . . . are most careful to preserve their hair intact. They  pride themselves on its length and weight. For a woman to have to  part with her hair is one of the greatest of degradations, and the  most terrible of all trials. It is the mark of widowhood. Yet in some  sacred places, especially at the confluence of rivers, the cutting  off and offering of a few locks of hair (_Veni-danam_) by a virtuous  wife is considered a highly meritorious act' (Monier Williams,  _Religious Thought and Life in India_, p, 375). Gaya in Bihar, fifty-  five miles south of Patna, is much frequented by pilgrims devoted to  Vishnu.    8. All the places named are in the Central Provinces. Ratanpur, in  the Bilaspur District, is a place of much antiquarian interest, full  of ruins; Mandla, in the Mandla District, was the capital of the  later Gond chiefs of Garha Mandla; and Sambalpur is the capital of  the Sambalpur District. If the story is true, the selection of a  Brahman for sacrifice is remarkable, though not without precedent.  Human sacrifice has prevailed largely in India, and is not yet quite  extinct. In 1891 some Jats in the Muzaffarnagar District of the  United Provinces sacrificed a boy in a very painful manner for some  unascertained magical purpose. It was supposed that the object was to  induce the gods to grant offspring to a childless woman. Other  similar cases have occurred in recent years. One occurred close to  Calcutta in 1892. In the hill tracts of Orissa bordering on the  Central Provinces the rite of human sacrifice was practised by the  Khonds on an awful scale, and with horrid cruelty, It was suppressed  by the special efforts of Macpherson, Campbell, MacViccar, and other  officers, between the years 1837 and 1854. Daring that period the  British officers rescued 1,506 victims intended for sacrifice  (_Narrative of Major-General John Campbell, C.B., of his Operations  in the Hill Tracts of Orissa for the Suppression of Human Sacrifices  and Female Infanticide_. Printed for private circulation. London:  Hurst and Blackett, 1861). The rite, when practised by Hindoos, may  have been borrowed from some of the aboriginal races. The practice,  however, has been so general throughout the world that few peoples  can claim the honour of freedom from the stain of adopting it at one  time or another, Much curious information on the subject, and many  modern instances of human sacrifices in India, are collected in the  article 'Sacrifice' in Balfour, _Cyclopaedia of India_, 3rd edition,  1885. Major S. C. Macpherson, _Memorials of Service in India_ (1865),  and Frazer, _Golden Bough_, 3rd edition, Part V, vol. i (1912), pp.  236 seq., may also be consulted.    9. Bernier vividly describes an 'infernal tragedy' of this kind which  he witnessed, in or about the year 1659, during Aurangzeb's reign, in  Rajputana. On that occasion five female slaves burnt themselves with  their mistress (_Travels_, ed. Constable and V. A. Smith (1914), p.  309).    10. Hinduism is a social system, not a creed, A Hindoo may believe,  or disbelieve, what speculative doctrine he chooses, but he must not  eat, drink, or marry, save in accordance with the custom of his  caste. Compare Asoka on toleration; 'The sects of other people all  deserve reverence for one reason or another' (Rock Edict xii; V. A.  Smith, _Asoka_, 2nd edition (1909), p. 170).    11. Mir Salamat Ali is a stanch Sunni, the sect of Osman; and they  are always at daggers drawn with the Shias, or the sect of Ali. He  alludes to the Shias when he says that one of the seventy-two sects  is always ready to take in the whole of the other seventy-one.  Muhammad, according to the traditions, was one day heard to say, 'The  time will come when my followers will he divided into seventy-three  sects; all of them will assuredly go to hell save one.' Every one of  the seventy-three sects believes itself to be the one happily  excepted by their prophet, and predestined to paradise. I am  sometimes disposed to think Muhammad was self-deluded, however  difficult it might be to account for so much 'method in his madness'.  It is difficult to conceive a man placed in such circumstances with  more amiable dispositions or with juster views of the rights and  duties of men in all their relations with each other, than are  exhibited by him on almost all occasions, save where the question of  _faith_ in his divine mission was concerned.    A very interesting and useful book might be made out of the history  of those men, more or less mad, by whom multitudes of mankind have  been led and perhaps governed; and a philosophical analysis of the  points on which they were really mad and really sane, would show many  of them to have been fit subjects for a madhouse during the whole  career of their glory. [W. H. S.]    For an account of Muhammadan sects, see section viii of the  Preliminary Dissertation in Sale's Koran, entitled, 'Of the Principal  Sects among the Muhammadans; and of those who have pretended to  Prophecy among the Arabs, in or since the Time of Muhammad'; and T.  P. Hughes, _Dictionary of Islam_ (1885). The chief sects of the  Sunnis, or Traditionists, are four in number. 'The principal sects of  the Shias are five, which are subdivided into an almost innumerable  number.' The court of the kings of Oudh was Shia. In most parts of  India the Sunni faith prevails.    The relation between genius and insanity is well expressed by Dryden  (_Absalom and Achitopfel_):        Great wits are sure to madness near allied,      And thin partitions do their bounds divide.    The treatise of Professor Cesare Lombroso, entitled _The Man of  Genius_ (London edition, 1891), is devoted to proof and illustration  of the proposition that genius is 'a special morbid condition'. He  deals briefly with the case of Muhammad at pages 31, 39, and 325,  maintaining that the prophet, like Saint Paul, Julius Caesar, and  many other men of genius, was subject to epileptic fits. The  Professor's book seems to be exactly what Sir W. H. Sleeman desired  to see.    12. In the author's time, when municipal conservancy and sanitation  were almost unknown in India, the tyranny of the sweepers' guild was  chiefly felt as a private inconvenience. It is now one of the  principal of the many difficulties, little understood in Europe,  which bar the progress of Indian sanitary reform. The sweepers cannot  be readily coerced because no Hindoo or Musalman would do their work  to save his life, nor will he pollute himself even by beating the  refractory scavenger. A strike of sweepers on the occasion of a great  fair, or of a cholera epidemic, is a most dangerous calamity. The  vested rights described in the text are so fully recognized in  practice that they are frequently the subject of sale or mortgage.    13. The low-caste Hindoos are generally fond of drink, when they can  get it, but seldom commit crime under its influence.    14. An elephant driver, by reason of his position on the animal, has  opportunities for private conversation with his master.      15. Elephant drivers (_mahouts_) are Muhammadans, who should have no  caste, but Indian Musalmans have become Hinduized, and fallen under  the dominion of caste.    16. Darbhanga is in Tirhut, seventy miles NE. of Dinapore. The Kusi  (Kosi or Koosee) river rises in the mountains of Nepal, and falls  into the Ganges after a course of about 325 miles. Nathpur, in the  Puraniya (Purneah) District, is a mart for the trade with Nepal.    17. The customary attitude of a suppliant.    18. A small river which falls into the Nerbudda on the right-hand  side, at Sankal. Its general course is south-west.    19. November, 1835.    20. Described in the _Gazetteer_ (1870) as 'a large but decaying  village in the Jabalpur district, situated at the foot of the Bhanrer  hills, twenty-two miles to the north-west of Jabalpur, on the north  side of the Hiran, and on the road to Sagar'.    21. The convenient restriction of the name Vindhya to the hills  north, and of Satpura to the hills south of the Nerbudda is of modern  origin (_Manual of the Geology of India_, 1st ed., Part I, p. iv).  The Satpura range, thus defined, separates the valley of the Nerbudda  from the valleys of the Tapti flowing west, and the Mahanadi flowing  east. The Vindhyan sandstones certainly are a formation of immense  antiquity, perhaps pre-Silurian. They are azoic, or devoid of  fossils; and it is consequently impossible to determine exactly their  geological age, or 'horizon' (ibid. p. xxiii). The cappings of  basalt, in some cases with laterite superimposed, suggest many  difficult problems, which will be briefly discussed in the notes to  Chapters 14 and 17.          CHAPTER 9"]]]
