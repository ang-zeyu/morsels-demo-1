I have never seen it exploring the twigs of  even the smallest of bushes. When caged it pays no attention to the most  enticing caterpillars if the latter take refuge in a tuft of thyme, at a  few inches above the ground. This is a great pity. If only the beetle  could climb how rapidly three or four would rid our cabbages of that  grievous pest, the larva of the white cabbage butterfly! Alas! the best  have always some failing, some vice.    To exterminate caterpillars: that is the true vocation of the Golden  Gardener. It is annoying that it can give us but little or no assistance  in ridding us of another plague of the kitchen-garden: the snail. The  slime of the snail is offensive to the beetle; it is safe from the  latter unless crippled, half crushed, or projecting from the shell. Its  relatives, however, do not share this dislike. The horny Procrustes, the  great Scarabicus, entirely black and larger than the Carabus, attacks  the snail most valiantly, and empties its shell to the bottom, in spite  of the desperate secretion of slime. It is a pity that the Procrustes is  not more frequently found in our gardens; it would be an excellent  gardener's assistant.          CHAPTER IX    THE GOLDEN GARDENER--COURTSHIP      It is generally recognized that the Carabus auratus is an active  exterminator of caterpillars; on this account in particular it deserves  its title of Gardener Beetle; it is the vigilant policeman of our  kitchen-gardens, our flower-beds and herbaceous borders. If my inquiries  add nothing to its established reputation in this respect, they will  nevertheless, in the following pages, show the insect in a light as yet  unsuspected. The ferocious beast of prey, the ogre who devours all  creatures that are not too strong for him, is himself killed and eaten:  by his fellows, and by many others.    Standing one day in the shadow of the plane-trees that grow before my  door, I see a Golden Gardener go by as if on pressing business. The  pilgrim is well met; he will go to swell the contents of my vivarium. In  capturing him I notice that the extremities of the wing-covers are  slightly damaged. Is this the result of a struggle between rivals? There  is nothing to tell me. The essential thing is that the insect should not  be handicapped by any serious injury. Inspected, and found to be without  any serious wound and fit for service, it is introduced into the glass  dwelling of its twenty-five future companions.    Next day I look for the new inmate. It is dead. Its comrades have  attacked it during the night and have cleaned out its abdomen,  insufficiently protected by the damaged wing-covers. The operation has  been performed very cleanly, without any dismemberment. Claws, head,  corselet, all are correctly in place; the abdomen only has a gaping  wound through which its contents have been removed. What remains is a  kind of golden shell, formed of the two conjoined elytra. The shell of  an oyster emptied of its inmate is not more empty.    This result astonishes me, for I have taken good care that the cage  should never be long without food. The snail, the pine-cockchafer, the  Praying Mantis, the lob-worm, the caterpillar, and other favourite  insects, have all been given in alternation and in sufficient  quantities. In devouring a brother whose damaged armour lent itself to  any easy attack my beetles had not the excuse of hunger.    Is it their custom to kill the wounded and to eviscerate such of their  fellows as suffer damage? Pity is unknown among insects. At the sight of  the desperate struggles of a crippled fellow-creature none of the same  family will cry a halt, none will attempt to come to its aid. Among the  carnivorous insects the matter may develop to a tragic termination. With  them, the passers-by will often run to the cripple. But do they do so in  order to help it? By no means: merely to taste its flesh, and, if they  find it agreeable, to perform the most radical cure of its ills by  devouring it.    It is possible, therefore, that the Gardener with the injured  wing-covers had tempted his fellows by the sight of his imperfectly  covered back. They saw in their defenceless comrade a permissible  subject for dissection. But do they respect one another when there is no  previous wound? At first there was every appearance that their relations  were perfectly pacific. During their sanguinary meals there is never a  scuffle between the feasters; nothing but mere mouth-to-mouth thefts.  There are no quarrels during the long siestas in the shelter of the  board. Half buried in the cool earth, my twenty-five subjects slumber  and digest their food in peace; they lie sociably near one another, each  in his little trench. If I raise the plank they awake and are off,  running hither and thither, constantly encountering one another without  hostilities.    The profoundest peace is reigning, and to all appearances will last for  ever, when in the early days of June I find a dead Gardener. Its limbs  are intact; it is reduced to the condition of a mere golden husk; like  the defenceless beetle I have already spoken of, it is as empty as an  oyster-shell. Let us examine the remains. All is intact, save the huge  breach in the abdomen. So the insect was sound and unhurt when the  others attacked it.    A few days pass, and another Gardener is killed and dealt with as  before, with no disorder in the component pieces of its armour. Let us  place the dead insect on its belly; it is to all appearances untouched.  Place it on its back; it is hollow, and has no trace of flesh left  beneath its carapace. A little later, and I find another empty relic;  then another, and yet another, until the population of my menagerie is  rapidly shrinking. If this insensate massacre continues I shall soon  find my cage depopulated.    Are my beetles hoary with age? Do they die a natural death, and do the  survivors then clean out the bodies? Or is the population being reduced  at the expense of sound and healthy insects? It is not easy to elucidate  the matter, since the atrocities are commonly perpetrated in the night.  But, finally, with vigilance, on two occasions, I surprise the beetles  at their work in the light of day.    Towards the middle of June a female attacks a male before my eyes. The  male is recognisable by his slightly smaller size. The operation  commences. Raising the ends of the wing-covers, the assailant seizes her  victim by the extremity of the abdomen, from the dorsal side. She pulls  at him furiously, eagerly munching with her mandibles. The victim, who  is in the prime of life, does not defend himself, nor turn upon his  assailant. He pulls his hardest in the opposite direction to free  himself from those terrible fangs; he advances and recoils as he is  overpowered by or overpowers the assassin; and there his resistance  ends. The struggle lasts a quarter of an hour. Other beetles, passing  by, call a halt, and seem to say \"My turn next!\" Finally, redoubling his  efforts, the male frees himself and flies. If he had not succeeded in  escaping the ferocious female would undoubtedly have eviscerated him.    [Illustration: THE GOLDEN GARDENER: THE MATING SEASON OVER, THE MALES  ARE EVISCERATED BY THE FEMALES.]    A few days later I witness a similar scene, but this time the tragedy is  played to the end. Once more it is a female who seizes a male from  behind. With no other protest except his futile efforts to escape, the  victim is forced to submit. The skin finally yields; the wound  enlarges, and the viscera are removed and devoured by the matron, who  empties the carapace, her head buried in the body of her late companion.  The legs of the miserable victim tremble, announcing the end. The  murderess takes no notice; she continues to rummage as far as she can  reach for the narrowing of the thorax. Nothing is left but the closed  boat-shaped wing-covers and the fore parts of the body. The empty shell  is left lying on the scene of the tragedy.    In this way must have perished the beetles--always males--whose remains  I find in the cage from time to time; thus the survivors also will  perish. Between the middle of June and the 1st of August the inhabitants  of the cage, twenty-five in number at the outset, are reduced to five,  all of whom are females. All the males, to the number of twenty, have  disappeared, eviscerated and completely emptied. And by whom? Apparently  by the females.    That this is the case is attested in the first place by the two assaults  of which I was perchance the witness; on two occasions, in broad  daylight, I saw the female devouring the male, having opened the abdomen  under the wing-covers, or having at least attempted to do so. As for the  rest of the massacres, although direct observation was lacking, I had  one very valuable piece of evidence. As we have seen, the victim does  not retaliate, does not defend himself, but simply tries to escape by  pulling himself away.    If it were a matter of an ordinary fight, a conflict such as might arise  in the struggle for life, the creature attacked would obviously  retaliate, since he is perfectly well able to do so; in an ordinary  conflict he would meet force by force, and return bite for bite. His  strength would enable him to come well out of a struggle, but the  foolish creature allows himself to be devoured without retaliating. It  seems as though an invincible repugnance prevents him from offering  resistance and in turn devouring the devourer. This tolerance reminds  one of the scorpion of Languedoc, which on the termination of the  hymeneal rites allows the female to devour him without attempting to  employ his weapon, the venomous dagger which would form a formidable  defence; it reminds us also of the male of the Praying Mantis, which  still embraces the female though reduced to a headless trunk, while
