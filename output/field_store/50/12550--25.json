The devil begged and  prayed so nicely to be let loose, but the youngster would not listen to  anything of the kind unless he promised that he would never come there  any more and create any disturbance. He also had to promise that he  would build a bridge over the sound, so that people could pass over it  at all times of the year, and it should be ready when the ice was gone.    \"They are very hard conditions,\" said the devil; but there was no other  way out of it--if the devil wanted to be set free, he would have to  promise it. He bargained, however, that he should have the first soul  that went across the bridge. That was to be the toll.    Yes, he should have that, said the youngster. So the devil was let  loose, and he started home. But the youngster lay down to sleep, and  slept till far into the day.    When the king came to see if he was cut and chopped into small pieces,  he had to wade through all the money before he came to his bedside.  There was money in heaps and in bags which reached far up the wall, and  the youngster lay in bed asleep and snoring hard.    \"Lord help me and my daughter,\" said the king when he saw that the  youngster was alive. Well, all was good and well done, that no one could  deny; but there was no hurry talking of the wedding before the bridge  was ready.    One day the bridge stood ready, and the devil was there waiting for the  toll which he had bargained for.    The youngster wanted the king to go with him and try the bridge, but the  king had no mind to do it. So he mounted a horse himself, and put the  fat dairy-maid in the palace on the pommel in front of him; she looked  almost like a big fir block, and so he rode over the bridge, which  thundered under the horse's feet.    \"Where is the toll? Where have you got the soul?\" cried the devil.    \"Why, inside this fir block,\" said the youngster; \"if you want it you  will have to spit in your hands and take it.\"    \"No, many thanks! If she does not come to me, I am sure I shan't take  her,\" said the devil. \"You got me once into a pinch, and I'll take care  you don't get me into another,\" and with that he flew straight home to  his old mother, and since that time he has never been heard or seen  thereabouts.    The youngster went home to the palace and asked for the reward the king  had promised him, and when the king wanted to get out of it, and would  not stick to what he had promised, the youngster said it was best he got  a good bag of food ready for him and he would take his reward himself.    Yes, the king would see to that, and when the bag was ready the  youngster asked the king to come outside the door. The youngster then  gave the king such a kick, which sent him flying up in the air. The bag  he threw after him that he might not be without food; and if he has not  come down again by this he is floating about with his bag between heaven  and earth to this very day.          XVIII    HANS, WHO MADE THE PRINCESS LAUGH      Once upon a time there was a king, who had a daughter, and she was so  lovely that the reports of her beauty went far and wide; but she was so  melancholy that she never laughed, and besides she was so grand and  proud that she said \"No\" to all who came to woo her--she would not have  any of them, were they ever so fine, whether they were princes or  noblemen.    The king was tired of this whim of hers long ago, and thought she ought  to get married like other people; there was nothing she need wait  for--she was old enough and she would not be any richer either, for she  was to have half the kingdom, which she inherited after her mother.    So he made known every Sunday after the service, from the steps outside  the church, that he that could make his daughter laugh should have both  her and half the kingdom. But if there were any one who tried and could  not make her laugh, he would have three red stripes cut out of his back  and salt rubbed into them--and, sad to relate, there were many sore  backs in that kingdom. Lovers from south and from north, from east and  from west, came to try their luck--they thought it was an easy thing to  make a princess laugh. They were a queer lot altogether, but for all  their cleverness and for all the tricks and pranks they played, the  princess was just as serious and immovable as ever.    But close to the palace lived a man who had three sons, and they had  also heard that the king had made known that he who could make the  princess laugh should have her and half the kingdom.    The eldest of the brothers wanted to try first, and away he went; and  when he came to the palace, he told the king he wouldn't mind trying to  make the princess laugh.    \"Yes, yes! that's all very well,\" said the king; \"but I am afraid it's  of very little use, my man. There have been many here to try their luck,  but my daughter is just as sad, and I am afraid it is no good trying. I  do not like to see any more suffer on that account.\"    But the lad thought he would try anyhow. It couldn't be such a difficult  thing to make a princess laugh at him, for had not everybody, both grand  and simple, laughed so many a time at him when he served as soldier and  went through his drill under Sergeant Nils.    So he went out on the terrace outside the princess's windows and began  drilling just as if Sergeant Nils himself were there. But all in vain!  The princess sat just as serious and immovable as before, and so they  took him and cut three broad, red stripes out of his back and sent him  home.    He had no sooner arrived home than his second brother wanted to set out  and try his luck. He was a schoolmaster, and a funny figure he was  altogether. He had one leg shorter than the other, and limped terribly  when he walked. One moment he was no bigger than a boy, but the next  moment when he raised himself up on his long leg he was as big and tall  as a giant--and besides he was great at preaching.    When he came to the palace, and said that he wanted to make the princess  laugh, the king thought that it was not so unlikely that he might; \"but  I pity you, if you don't succeed,\" said the king, \"for we cut the  stripes broader and broader for every one that tries.\"    So the schoolmaster went out on the terrace, and took his place outside  the princess's window, where he began preaching and chanting imitating  seven of the parsons, and reading and singing just like seven of the  clerks whom they had had in the parish.    The king laughed at the schoolmaster till he was obliged to hold on to  the door-post, and the princess was just on the point of smiling, but  suddenly she was as sad and immovable as ever, and so it fared no better  with Paul the schoolmaster than with Peter the soldier--for Peter and  Paul were their names, you must know!    So they took Paul and cut three red stripes out of his back, put salt  into them, and sent him home again.    Well, the youngest brother thought he would have a try next. His name  was Hans. But the brothers laughed and made fun of him, and showed him  their sore backs. Besides, the father would not give him leave to go,  for he said it was no use his trying, who had so little sense; all he  could do was to sit in a corner on the hearth, like a cat, rooting about  in the ashes and cutting chips. But Hans would not give in--he begged  and prayed so long, till they got tired of his whimpering, and so he got  leave to go to the king's palace and try his luck.    When he arrived at the palace he did not say he had come to try to make  the princess laugh, but asked if he could get a situation there. No,  they had no situation for him; but Hans was not so easily put off--they  might want one to carry wood and water for the kitchenmaid in such a big  place as that, he said. Yes, the king thought so too, and to get rid of  the lad he gave him leave to remain there and carry wood and water for  the kitchenmaid.    One day, when he was going to fetch water from the brook, he saw a big  fish in the water just under an old root of a fir-tree, which the  current had carried all the soil away from. He put his bucket quietly  under the fish and caught it. As he was going home to the palace, he met  an old woman leading a golden goose.    \"Good day, grandmother!\" said Hans. \"That's a fine bird you have got  there; and such splendid feathers too! he shines a long way off. If one  had such feathers, one needn't be chopping firewood.\"    The woman thought just as much of the fish which Hans had in the bucket,  and said if Hans would give her the fish he should have the golden  goose; and this goose was such that if any one touched it he would be  sticking fast to it if he only said: \"If you'll come along, then hang  on.\"    Yes, Hans would willingly exchange on those terms. \"A bird is as good as  a fish any day,\" he said to himself. \"If it is as you say, I might use  it instead of a fish-hook,\" he said to the woman, and felt greatly  pleased with the possession of the goose.    He had not gone far before he met another old woman. When she saw the  splendid golden goose, she must go and stroke it. She made herself so  friendly and spoke so nicely to Hans, and asked him to let her stroke  that lovely golden goose of his.    \"Oh, yes!\" said Hans, \"but you mustn't pluck off any of its feathers!\"    Just as she stroked the bird, Hans said: \"If you'll come along, then  hang on!\"    The woman pulled and tore, but she had to hang on, whether she would or  no, and Hans walked on, as if he only had the goose with him.    When he had gone some distance, he met a man who had a spite against the  woman for a trick she had played upon him. When he saw that she fought  so hard to get free and seemed to hang on so fast, he thought he might  safely venture to pay her off for the grudge he owed her, and so he gave  her a kick.    \"If you'll come along, then hang on!\" said Hans, and the man had to hang  on and limp along"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#19)"],[1,"shall have.\"    \"Nay,\" cried the man. \"I think I'll go on. I'd rather have what's in  your bag.\"    [Illustration: The old man gallops away]    And away he galloped, riding as he never rode before.      II      The thief thought there must be something in the old man's bags; so with  his big rusty knife he chopped them into rags. But no money did he find,  for the silly old man was not so silly as he seemed. His money was in  his pocket.    The old man rode on to his landlord's home and paid his rent. Then he  opened the thief's bag, which was glorious to behold. There were five  hundred pounds in gold and silver.    \"Where did you get the silver?\" asked the landlord. \"And where did you  get the gold?\"    \"I met a proud fool on the way,\" said the old man with a laugh. \"I  swapped horses with him, and he gave me this to boot.\"    \"Well, well! But you're too old to go about with so much money,\" said  the landlord.    \"Oh, I think no one would harm a silly old man like me,\" said the  farmer, as he rode away.    The old man went home by a narrow lane, and there he spied Tib tied to a  tree.    \"The stranger did not like his trade, I fear,\" said he. \"So I think I'll  take Tib home.\"    The old man went home much richer than when he left. When she heard the  story, the wife danced and sang for glee. \"'Tis hard to fool my old  man,\" said she.    --ENGLISH BALLAD (_Adapted_).          [Illustration: The Rock-a-By Lady walking by]    THE ROCK-A-BY LADY        The Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street      Comes stealing; comes creeping;    The poppies they hang from her head to her        feet,    And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleet--    She bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,      When she findeth you sleeping!      There is one little dream of a beautiful drum--      \"Rub-a-dub!\" it goeth;    There is one little dream of a big sugar-plum,    And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come    Of pop-guns that bang, and tin tops that hum,      And a trumpet that bloweth!      And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams      With laughter and singing;    And boats go a-floating on silvery streams,    And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty gleams,    And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,      The fairies go winging!      Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny and fleet?      They'll come to you sleeping;    So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,    For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street    With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,      Comes stealing; comes creeping.    --EUGENE FIELD.          THE SANDMAN        The rosy clouds float overhead,      The sun is going down;    And now the sandman's gentle tread      Comes stealing through the town.    \"White sand, white sand,\" he softly cries,      And as he shakes his hand,    Straightway there lies on babies' eyes      His gift of shining sand.    Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,    As shuts the rose, they softly close,      When he goes through the town.      From sunny beaches far away--      Yes, in another land--    He gathers up at break of day      His store of shining sand.    No tempests beat that shore remote,      No ships may sail that way;    His little boat alone may float      Within that lovely bay.    Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,    As shuts the rose, they softly close,      When he goes through the town.    [Illustration: The sandman]      He smiles to see the eyelids close      Above the happy eyes;    And every child right well he knows,      Oh, he is very wise!    But, if as he goes through the land,      A naughty baby cries,    His other hand takes dull gray sand      To close the wakeful eyes.    Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,    As shuts the rose, they softly close,      When he goes through the town.      So when you hear the sandman's song      Sound through the twilight sweet,    Be sure you do not keep him long      A-waiting on the street.    Lie softly down, dear little head,      Rest quiet, busy hands,    Till, by your bed his good-night said,      He strews the shining sands.    Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,    As shuts the rose, they softly close,      When he goes through the town.    --MARGARET VANDERGRIFT.
