He  seems to have been deprived during his lifetime, for what reason we  cannot say.    40. #Robert Boreman of Stevenage# (1538-1539). This Abbot was a nominee  of the King, and was chosen by him because Henry knew that he would be  willing to surrender the Abbey. This he did on December 5th, 1539. It  was part of the policy of Henry VIII. to make it appear that the  monasteries were _voluntarily_ surrendered by the abbot and chapter, and  it was generally made worth their while to do so by a liberal pension.  In some cases the abbots refused, among them the last Abbot of  Glastonbury, who paid dearly for his refusal, as he was hanged on a hill  commanding a view of the possessions of the Abbey, which not being his  to part with he had refused to surrender, though, of course, the nominal  charge against him was not the real one. Abbot Boreman, however, made no  objection, and received a yearly pension of L266 13s. 4d., so was a rich  man for the rest of his days. Pensions of varying amounts were given to  his monks. Boreman and twenty of the monks were in receipt of them when  Mary came to the throne. Mary wished to revive the Abbey and put Boreman  over it, but did not live to carry out her intended plan. The monastic  buildings very rapidly disappeared; the church became parochial, and has  been served by the following sixteen rectors:        George Wetherhall, appointed             1553.      Archdeacon William East.      Archdeacon James Dugdale,                1556.      Edward Edgeworth,                        1578.      Roger Williams,                          1582.      John Brown.      Archdeacon Edward Carter,                1662.      Archdeacon John Cole,                    1687.      Archdeacon John Cole (II.),              1713.      Benjamin Preedy,                         1754.      Joseph Spooner,                          1779.      John Payler Nicholson,                   1796.      Henry Small,                             1817.      Henry J.B. Nicholson,                    1835.      Sir John C. Hawkins, Bart.,              1866.      Archdeacon Walter John Lawrance,[12]     1868.        [12] Dean since July, 1900.    The Church of St. Albans was in the diocese of Lincoln until 1845, when  it was handed over to Rochester. In 1877 Parliament passed a bill for  the division of the populous diocese of Rochester into two parts; the  northern to be called the see of St. Albans, the southern to retain the  name of Rochester. The Right Rev. Dr. Claughton, then Bishop of  Rochester, elected to take the northern division of his old diocese and  became Bishop of St. Albans. He was succeeded in 1890 by John Wogan  Festing, D.D., who died in 1903.    Both of these bishops are buried in the churchyard on the north side of  the nave. On Dr. Festing's death the Right Rev. Edgar Jacob, D.D., was  translated to St. Albans from the diocese of Newcastle, and was  enthroned in May, 1903.    The Church of St. Albans, although legally a cathedral church, yet  differs in certain particulars from most of the other churches of this  rank in England. It is also used as a parish church, of which the Dean  is rector. He has the same powers, responsibilities, and duties as the  rector of any other parish. It is sometimes said that the nave is the  parish, and the part eastward of the rood screen the cathedral church,  but it is not so. The Dean as rector has power over the whole, and  parishioners have right of access to every part of the building, just as  in any other parish church; and the Dean as their rector can be called  upon to baptize, marry, visit, and bury the people under his charge.  Churchwardens are also appointed and have their statutory rights. There  are some honorary canons, but as yet no \"canons residentiary,\" nor are  there \"priests vicars\" (or \"minor canons\"), lay vicars, or choristers on  the foundation. The choir is a voluntary one, the clergy under the Dean  are curates.    The two parts of the church that are ordinarily in use are the Lady  Chapel, where morning and evening prayer is said daily on week-days, and  the nave, which is used for the Sunday services. There is at present no  high altar in place under the great screen, but one will probably be  placed there as soon as the final touches are put by Mr. Gilbert to the  carved work of the reredos. The choir proper is not, however, capable of  holding a large congregation. It was, of course, originally intended to  hold the monks only. The part eastward of the stalls might on special  occasions, such as the enthronement of a bishop, the installation of a  dean, be temporarily fitted with chairs, but it is not likely that any  permanent seats will be placed here, since as a matter of fact the nave  and Lady Chapel answer all ordinary requirements.    [Illustration: OLD FLOOR TILE.]    [Illustration: THE GREAT GATE.]          CHAPTER V.    THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.      #The Great Gatehouse.#--In the days of its prosperity the Abbey was  surrounded by a wall within which, as was usually the case, were placed  all the buildings that were necessary for monastic life: cloister,  dormitory, refectory, kitchen, chapter-house, infirmary, guest-house,  stables, dovecote, granary, garden, orchard, vineyard, lodgings for the  abbot, prior, cellarer, cook, and servants, fish-house, fish-ponds, as  well as cemeteries for dead brethren. A number of gatehouses gave access  to this inclosure: the Great Gate, which alone remains standing; the  Waxhouse Gate, where the tapers used for burning before the shrines were  made; the Water-gate, St. Germain's gate, and others. The chief of these  was the Great Gate to the west of the Abbey Church. It was built in the  time of Thomas de la Mare about 1365, on the site of a previously  existing gatehouse which had been destroyed by a violent gale a few  years earlier. It was not only a gateway, but a prison wherein offending  monks, and also laymen of the town, over which the Abbot had civic  jurisdiction, were imprisoned. The Gatehouse was stormed by rioters in  the time of Wat Tyler's rebellion, the monks in their terror giving wine  and beer to their assailants, but news arriving of Wat Tyler's death,  the rioters dispersed; the ringleaders were tried and condemned to  death, among them John Ball, who, with his seventeen condemned  companions, passed the time between their trial and execution in the  dungeons beneath the Gatehouse. In 1480 a printing press was set up in  this gatehouse; after the dissolution it was used as the borough gaol.  During the Napoleonic wars some French prisoners were confined within  the walls. In 1868 the Gatehouse was found too small for use as a gaol,  and a new prison was built near the Midland Station. The Gatehouse was  bought by the governors of the grammar school, and in 1870 the school  was removed from the Lady Chapel to the Gatehouse. There are dungeons  beneath the level of the roadway; over the archway is the large room  where the sessions used to be held, with other rooms on either side. In  this building some old chimney-pieces may still be seen. Although the  present foundation dates from the reign of Edward VI., yet a school had  existed in St. Albans from very early time. Some think it was founded by  Ulsinus. Be this as it may, it is certain that Geoffrey de Gorham, who  was afterwards Abbot (1119-1146), first came to England during the time  of Richard of Albini (the fifteenth Abbot), with a view of being master  of the school. In 1195 we read that the school had more scholars than  any other in England. The school in these early days stood to the north  of the Great Gate on the other side of the street that runs down the  hill on the north side of the triangular graveyard known as Romelands,  where a Protestant martyr, one George Tankerfield, a cook, born in York,  but living in London, was burnt on August 26th, 1555, during the reign  of Mary I.    #Sopwell Nunnery.#--There are a few remains of Sopwell Nunnery in a  field near the river Ver, to the south-east of the city. They may be  reached by taking the first turning to the right hand after crossing the  bridge on the way from the city down Holywell Hill. This nunnery was  founded by Geoffrey of Gorham, sixteenth Abbot, about the middle of the  twelfth century. Two women, pious and ascetic, had taken up their abode  on this spot in a hut which they built for themselves, and Geoffrey  determined to build them a more permanent dwelling, and make them the  nucleus of a religious house. They accepted the Benedictine Rule, and  gradually the nunnery increased in size, and many ladies of high birth  took the veil here. One of the abbesses wrote the \"Boke of St. Albans,\"  not, as might be imagined, an account of the saint or of the religious  house, but a treatise on hawking, hunting, and fishing. It was printed  in 1483 at the St. Albans printing press. When the nunnery was  dissolved, Sir Richard Lee, to whom the Abbey lands were granted, turned  it into a dwelling-house for himself. The ruins consist of ivy-clad  walls of brick and flint, pierced by square-headed windows, but  containing few interesting features.    The name is said to have been derived from the fact that the two women  mentioned above soaked or sopped their dry bread in water drawn from the  Holy Well or some well in the immediate neighbourhood of their hut.    #St. Peter's Church.#--This church, standing at no great distance from  the cathedral, may be reached by taking the footway called the  Cloisters, crossing High Street, passing between the Clock Tower and the  picturesque and ancient inn, the Fleur de Lys, and through the quaint  street of gabled houses known as French Row, into St. Peter's Street.    The church was originally built about 948 A.D., by Ulsinus, the sixth  Abbot of St. Albans, but none of his work remains. It seems to have been  almost entirely rebuilt at the end of the fifteenth century, and most of  it is Perpendicular "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],[0,"Music Notation and Terminology (#19)"],[1,"parts.    _Binary measure_--a measure having two beats.    _Bis_--twice. Used to indicate a repetition. (Rare.)    _Brace_--the sign used to join several staffs, showing that all tones  represented on these staffs are to be performed together. The term is  often used also in referring to the music written on staffs so joined;  as--\"Begin with the upper _brace_.\"    _Broken chord_--a chord whose tones are not all sounded simultaneously,  as _e.g._, in an accompaniment group.    _Broken octave_--an octave whose tones are sounded one at a time instead  of simultaneously.    _Cacophony_--harsh, discordant, unpleasant, especially _incorrect_  combinations of tones. The opposite of _euphony_.    _Cadenza_--A brilliant passage, usually in an instrumental composition,  introduced just before the close of a movement. The _cadenza_ was  formerly improvised by the performer, (thus giving an opportunity of  displaying his technical skill), but since Beethoven, composers have  usually written their own _cadenzas_.    _Cantabile_--in a singing style.    _Cantando_--same as _cantabile_.    _Canto_--the highest voice part; _i.e._, the soprano part.         Note the derivation of _canto_, _cantabile_, etc., from the       Latin word _cantus_, meaning a _song_.    _Carol_--a hymn of joyful praise, usually sung in connection with Easter  or Christmas festivities. The word _carol_ meant originally _a dance_,  hence the _happy_ character of songs of this type.    _Catch_--a round set to humorous words.    _Chromatic_ (noun)--a term somewhat loosely applied to any tone not  belonging to the key as indicated by the signature. Many teachers are  replacing the word _chromatic_ in this sense with the term _intermediate  tone_, this term being applicable whether the foreign tone is actually  used for ornamental purposes as a _chromatic_, or to effect a  modulation. Thus _e.g._, \"F[sharp] is the _intermediate tone_ between F  and G in the key of C.\"    _Clavichord_--an instrument with keys, resembling the square piano in  appearance. The tone was produced by forcing wedge-shaped pieces of  metal against the strings, thus setting them in vibration. The  _clavichord_ was one of the immediate predecessors of the piano, much of  the music written by Bach being composed for it, although this music is  now played on the modern piano.    _Colla voce_--with the voice: _i.e._, play the accompaniment according  to the soloist's performance rather than strictly according to the  rhythm indicated in the score.    _Colla parte_--same as _colla voce_.    _Coloratura_--florid passages in singing. Also applied to the style of  singing employed in rendering such passages. (See p. 76, Sec. 171.)    _Consonance_--A combination of tones agreeable to the ear and requiring  no resolution to other tone-combinations in order to give the effect of  finality. The major triad C--E--G is an example of a consonant chord.    _Contralto_--same as _alto_.    _Con variazioni_--with variations.    _Direct_--a sign ([direct symbol]) placed at the end of the last staff  on a page, to indicate what the first note on the next page is going to  be. This sign is now practically obsolete.    _Dirge_--a funeral chant. The dirge is named from the first word of a  chant used in the \"office for the dead,\" which begins--_Dirige Domine,  Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam_ (Direct, O Lord, My God, my way  in Thy sight).    _Discord_--an ugly, unharmonious combination of tones.    _Dissonance_--a harmonic combination of tones giving rise to the feeling  of incompleteness or unrest, and therefore requiring resolution to some  other combination which has an agreeable or final feeling. (cf.  consonance.) The diminished triad C--E[flat]--G[flat] is an example of a  dissonant chord.    _Divisi_--divided. An indication showing that the first violins, or the  sopranos, or any other body of performers ordinarily sounding in unison  are now to divide into two or more parts.    _Duet_--a composition for two performers. (From the It. word  _due_--two.)    _Ecole_--a school or style of composition or performance.    _Etude_--a study. Also an instrumental composition in the style of a  study, but intended for artistic performance.    _Euphony_--agreeable tone combinations; the opposite of cacophony. (From  the Greek word meaning _well-sounding_.)    _Facile_--easy.    _Fanfare_--a trumpet call.    _Fantasia_--An instrumental composition not based on any regular form.    _Fiasco_--a complete failure or breakdown.         This use of the word _fiasco_ (which means in Italian a flask,       or bottle) is said to have reference to the bursting of a       bottle, the complete ruin of the bottle being compared with       the complete failure of a performance.    _Gamut_--all the tones of a scale.    _Glissando_--playing a scale on the keyboard by drawing the finger along  over the keys, thus depressing them in very rapid succession. The word  is derived from the French word _glisser_--to glide.    _Harpsichord_--one of the immediate predecessors of the piano.    _Humoresque_--a capricious, fantastic composition. (Cf. _fantasia_.)    _Idyl_--a short, romantic piece of music in simple and unaffected style.    _In alt_--pitches in the first octave above the treble staff. Thus  _e.g._, \"C in alt\" is the C represented by the second added line above  the treble staff.    _In altissimo_--pitches in the octave above the _alt_ octave.    _Instrumentation_--see _orchestration_.    _Interlude_--a short movement between two larger movements.    _Loco_--place; _i.e._, play as written. (See p. 15, Sec. 46.)    _Lunga trillo_--a long trill.          CHAPTER XX    MISCELLANEOUS TERMS (_Continued_)      _Lyric_--a short, song-like poem of simple character. Also applied to  instrumental pieces of like character.    _Maggiore_--major.    _Marcato il canto_--the melody well marked; _i.e._, subdue the  accompaniment so that the melody may stand out strongly.    _Melos_--melody. This word _melos_ is also applied to the peculiar style  of vocal solo found in Wagner's music dramas. See _recitative_ (p. 75,  Sec. 170).    _Mellifluous_--pleasing; pleasant sounding.    _Menuetto, menuet_--same as _minuet_. (See p. 68, Sec. 151.)    _Mezzo soprano_--a woman's voice of soprano quality, but of somewhat  lower compass than the soprano voice. Range approximately b to g''.    _Minore_--minor.    _Nocturne_ (sometimes spelled _nocturn_, _notturna_, _nokturne_,  etc.)--a night piece; a quiet, melodious, somewhat sentimental  composition, usually for piano solo.    _Nuance_--delicate shading; subtle variations in tempo and dynamics  which make the rendition of music more expressive.    _Obbligato_ (sometimes incorrectly spelled _obligato_)--an accessory  melody accompanying harmonized music, (usually vocal music).         The word _obbligato_ (It. _bound_, or _obliged_) refers to the       fact that this is usually a melody of independent value, so       important that it cannot be omitted in a complete performance.    _Offertory_ (sometimes spelled _offertoire_, or _offertorium_)--a piece  of music played or sung during the taking up of the offering in the  church service. The word is often applied by composers to any short,  simple piece of music (usually for organ) that is suitable for the above  purpose.    _Opus_--work; used by composers to designate the order in which their  compositions were written, as _e.g._, Beethoven, Op. 2, No. 1.    _Orchestration_--the art of writing for the orchestra, this implying an  intimate knowledge of the range, quality, and possibilities of all the  orchestral instruments.    _Ossia_--or else; used most often to call the attention of the performer  to a simpler passage that may be substituted for the original one by a  player whose skill is not equal to the task he is attempting to perform.    _Overture_--(from _overt_--open)--an instrumental prelude to an opera or  oratorio. The older _overtures_ were independent compositions and bore  no particular relation to the work which was to follow, but in modern  music (cf. Wagner, Strauss, etc.), the _overture_ introduces the  principal themes that are to occur in the work itself, and the  introduction thus becomes an integral part of the work as a whole. The  word _overture_ is sometimes applied to independent orchestral  compositions that have no connection with vocal works, as the _Hebrides  Overture_ by Mendelssohn.    _Pizzicato_--plucked. A term found in music for stringed instruments,  and indicating that for the moment the bow is not to be used, the tone  being secured by _plucking_ the string.    _Polacca_--a Polish dance in three-quarter measure.    _Polonaise_--same as _polacca_.    _Postlude_--(lit. after-play)--an organ composition to be played at the  close of a church service.    _Prelude_--(lit. before-play)--an instrumental composition to be played  at the beginning of a church service, or before some larger work (opera,  etc.). The term is also applied to independent piano compositions of  somewhat indefinite form. (Cf. _preludes_ by Chopin, Rachmaninoff, etc.)    _Priere_--a prayer; a term often applied (especially by French  composers) to a quiet, devotional composition for organ.    _Quintole, quintuplet_--a group of five notes to be performed in the  time ordinarily given to four notes of the same value. There is only one  accent in the group, this occurring of course on the first of the five  tones.    _Religioso, religiosamente_--in a devotional style.    _Requiem_--the mass for the dead in the Roman Catholic service. It is so  called from its first word _requiem_ which means _rest_. (See p. 77,  Sec. 165.)    _Rhapsody_--an irregular instrumental composition of the nature of an  improvisation. A term first applied by Liszt to a series of piano pieces  based on gypsy themes.    _Ribattuta_--a device in instrumental music whereby a two-note phrase is  gradually accelerated, even to the extent of becoming a trill.
