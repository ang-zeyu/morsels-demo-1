Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the  bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for  Pennsylvania, who was in London. \"Do you think it right,\" asked  Grenville, \"that America should be protected by this country and pay no  part of the expenses?\" The answer was brief: \"That is not the case; the  colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five  thousand men and spent many millions.\" Then came an inquiry whether the  colonists would accept a modified stamp act. \"No, never,\" replied  Franklin, \"never! They will never submit to it!\" It was next suggested  that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready  answer. \"They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a  rebellion; they may, indeed, make one.\"    The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days  later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts  due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,  workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the  colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close  of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor  of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.  \"America must learn,\" he wailed, \"that prayers are not to be brought to  Caesar through riot and sedition.\" His protests were idle. The Commons  agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the  victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of  strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now  restored to his right mind.    In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of  the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it  accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the  colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;  that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make  laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the  resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were  null and void.    The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular  demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and  trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper  resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered  the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the  news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically  restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend  inaugurated their policy of \"thoroughness.\"      RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES    =The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.  Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and  seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness  gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.  Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought  forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,  which to this day are associated with his name. First among his  restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement  of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports  in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in  the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all  control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a  tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into  the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward  the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial  officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the  tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This  law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in  England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea  merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea  smugglers.    =Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been  content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,  and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of  the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the  harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at  their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,  1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to  issue \"writs of assistance,\" empowering customs officers to enter \"any  house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies  or plantations in America to search for and seize\" prohibited or  smuggled goods.    The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to  revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who  cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual  gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a \"minion of the law\"  to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much  for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for  self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to  establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.    The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent  illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that  time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which  arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a  Massachusetts court for writs of assistance \"as usual.\" This application  was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a  speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it  away \"ready to take up arms against writs of assistance.\" Otis denounced  the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king  his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the  liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work  possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to  spread terror and desolation through the land. \"What a scene,\" he  exclaimed, \"does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,  or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a  writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary  exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and  blood.\" He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament  could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.  This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly  echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to  America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.  \"Then and there,\" wrote John Adams, \"the child Independence was born.\"  Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of  customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.    =The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's  Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.  The assembly of New York, protesting against the \"ruinous and  insupportable\" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the  care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering  Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to  obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance  with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the  meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their  representative bodies rested.      RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA    =The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the  leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed  intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a  Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies  informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly  condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that  Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent  and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be  represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to  consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free  who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and  paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,  in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common  predicament in which they were all placed.    [Illustration: _From an old print._    SAMUEL ADAMS]    =The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing  of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On  meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and  South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also  dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,  passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of  imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew  the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of  persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the  king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution  of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal  governor.    =The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities  kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of  citizens searched, and troops distributed in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#19)"],[1,"ffing. Returning home from exciting  political meetings in the country to the waiting press in London,  I do verily believe I have been upset in almost every description  of vehicle known in this country. I have been, in my time, belated  on miry by-roads, towards the small hours, forty or fifty miles from  London, in a wheelless carriage, with exhausted horses and drunken  post-boys, and have got back in time for publication, to be received  with never-forgotten compliments by the late Mr Black, coming in the  broadest of Scotch from the broadest of hearts I ever knew.\"    During these later years England came to look upon her duties and  responsibilities toward her colonial possessions in quite a  different light. Imperialism became a factor in the political life  of the nation.    The builders of Empire in the time of Queen Elizabeth took a very  narrow view of their responsibilities; they were not in the least  degree concerned about the well-being of a colony or possession for  its own sake. The state of Ireland in those days spoke for itself.  The horrors of the Indian Mutiny in 1857 was the first lesson which  opened England's eyes to the fact that an Empire, if it is to be  anything more than a name, must be a united whole under wise and  sympathetic guidance.    The rebellion proved to be the end of the old East Indian Company.  England took over the administration of Indian affairs into her own  hands. An \"Act for the better Government of India\" was passed in 1858,  which provided that all the territories previously under the  government of the Company were to be vested in Her Majesty, and all  the Company's powers to be exercised in her name. The Viceroy, with  the assistance of a Council, was to be supreme in India.    In 1867 a great colonial reform was carried out, the Confederation  of the North American Provinces of the British Empire. By this Act  the names of Upper and Lower Canada were changed respectively to  Ontario and Quebec. The first Dominion Parliament met in the autumn  of the same year, and lost no time in passing an Act to construct  an Inter-Colonial Railway affording proper means of communication  between the maritime and central provinces.    In 1869 the Hudson Bay territory was acquired from the Company which  held it, and after the Red River Insurrection, headed by a half-breed,  Louis Riel, had been successfully crushed by the Wolseley Expedition,  the territory was made part of the Federation. In 1871 British  Columbia became part of the Dominion, on condition that a railway  was constructed within the following ten years which should extend  from the Pacific to the Rocky Mountains and connect with the existing  railway system.    The great Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in 1885, opening  out the West to all-comers.    The rise and growth of the Imperialistic spirit has been greatly  influenced by the literature on the subject, which dated its  commencement from Professor Seeley's _Expansion of England_ in 1883.  This was followed by an immense number of works by various writers,  the chief of whom, Rudyard Kipling, has popularized the conception  of Imperialism and extended its meaning:        Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,      But over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown.    The Empire was not, however, to be consolidated without war and  bloodshed, for relations with the two Boer Republics, the Transvaal  and the Orange River, became more and more strained as years went  on. The last years of the Queen's life were destined to be saddened  by the outbreak of war in South Africa.    The facts which led to the outbreak were briefly these, though it  is but fair to state that there are, even now, various theories  current as to the causes. The discovery and opening up of the gold  mines of the Transvaal had brought a stream of adventurous emigrants  into the country, and it was these 'Outlanders' of whom the Dutch  were suspicious. The Transvaal Government refused to admit them to  equal political rights with the Dutch inhabitants. It was certain,  however, that the Outlanders would never submit to be dependent on  the policy of President Kruger, although the Dutch declared that they  had only accepted the suzerainty of Great Britain under compulsion.    Negotiations between the two Governments led to nothing, as neither  side would give way, and at last, in 1899, following upon an ultimatum  demanding the withdrawal of British troops from the borders of the  Republic, war broke out. It had undoubtedly been hastened by the  ill-fated and ill-advised raid in 1896 of Dr Jameson, the  administrator of Rhodesia.    It is scarcely necessary to review the details of this war at any  length. It proved conclusively that the Government of this country  had vastly underrated the resisting powers of the Boers. For three  years the British army was forced to wage a guerilla warfare, and  adapt itself to entirely new methods of campaigning.    On May 28, 1900, the Orange Free State was annexed under the name  of the Orange River Colony. In June Lord Roberts entered Pretoria,  but the war dragged on until 1902, when a Peace Conference was held  and the Boer Republics became part of the British Empire. Very  liberal terms were offered to and accepted by the conquered Dutch.  But long before this event took place Queen Victoria had passed away.  She had followed the whole course of the war with the deepest interest  and anxiety, and when Lord Roberts returned to this country, leaving  Lord Kitchener in command in South Africa, the Queen was desirous  of hearing from his own lips the story of the campaign.    The public was already uneasy about the state of her health, and on  January 20th it was announced that her condition had become serious.  On Tuesday, January 22, she was conscious and recognized the members  of her family watching by her bedside, but on the afternoon of the  same day she peacefully passed away. One of the last wishes she  expressed was that her body should be borne to rest on a gun-carriage,  for she had never forgotten that she was a soldier's daughter.    On the day of the funeral the horses attached to the gun-carriage  became restive, and the sailors who formed the guard of honour took  their place, and drew the coffin, draped in the Union Jack, to its  last resting-place.    Through the streets of London, which had witnessed two great Jubilee  processions, festivals of rejoicing and thanksgiving, the funeral  cortege passed, and a great reign and a great epoch in history had  come to an end.          CHAPTER XV: _Victoria the Great_      The keynote of Queen Victoria's life was simplicity. She was a great  ruler, and at the same time a simple-minded, sympathetic woman, the  true mother of her people. She seemed by some natural instinct to  understand their joys and their sorrows, and this was the more  remarkable as for forty years she reigned alone without the  invaluable advice and assistance of her husband.    Her qualities were not those which have made other great rulers  famous, but they were typical of the age in which she lived.    All her life she was industrious, and never spared herself any time  or trouble, however arduous and disagreeable her duties might be.  She possessed the keenest sense of duty, and in dealing with men and  circumstances she never failed to do or say the right thing. Her daily  intercourse with the leading English statesmen of the time gave her  an unrivalled knowledge of home and foreign politics. In short, her  natural ability and good sense, strengthened by experience, made her  what she was, a perfect model of a constitutional monarch.    During her reign the Crown once again took its proper place: no longer  was there a gulf between the Ruler and the People, and Patriotism,  the love of Queen and Country, became a real and living thing. Pope's  adage, \"A patriot is a fool in every age,\" could no longer be quoted  with any truth.    Queen Victoria was, above all, a great lover of peace, and did all  in her power for its promotion. Her personal influence was often the  means of smoothing over difficulties both at home and abroad when  her Ministers had aggravated instead of lessening them. She formed  her own opinions and held to them, though she was always willing to  listen to reason.    The Memorandum which she drew up in the year 1850 shows how firm a  stand she could take when her country's peace seemed to be  threatened.    Lord Palmerston, though an able Minister in many respects, was a  wilful, hot-headed man, who was over-fond of acting on the spur of  the moment without consulting his Sovereign. His dispatches, written  as they so often were in a moment of feverish enthusiasm, frequently  gave offence to foreign monarchs and statesmen, and were more than  once nearly the cause of war. It was remarked of him that \"the desk  was his place of peril, his pen ran away with him. His speech never  made an enemy, his writing has left many festering sores. The charm  of manner and urbanity which so served him in Parliament and in  society was sometimes wanting on paper, and good counsels were dashed  with asperity.\"    Lord Palmerston, the Queen complained, did not obey instructions,  and she declared that before important dispatches were sent abroad  the Sovereign should be consulted. Further, alterations were  sometimes made by him when they had been neither suggested nor  approved by the Crown.    Such proceedings caused England, in the Queen's own words, to be  \"generally detested, mistrusted, and treated with indignity by even  the smallest Powers.\"    In the Memorandum the Queen requires:    \"(1) That he will distinctly state what he proposes in a given case,  in order that the Queen may know as distinctly to what she has given  her royal sanction.    \"(2) Having once given her sanction to a measure, that it be not  arbitrarily altered or modified by the Minister.
