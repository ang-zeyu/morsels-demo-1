In principle, this ceremony was bound to be  renewed year by year, till the end of time; but the Egyptians ere long  discovered that this could not be. After two or three generations, the dead  of former days were neglected for the benefit of those more recently  departed. Even when a pious foundation was established, with a revenue  payable for the expenses of the funerary repasts and of the priests whose  duty it was to prepare them, the evil hour of oblivion was put off for only  a little longer. Sooner or later, there came a time when the Double was  reduced to seek his food among the town refuse, and amid the ignoble and  corrupt filth which lay rejected on the ground. Then, in order that the  offerings consecrated on the day of burial might for ever preserve their  virtues, the survivors conceived the idea of drawing and describing them on  the walls of the chapel (fig. 127). The painted or sculptured reproduction  of persons and things ensured the reality of those persons and things for  the benefit of the one on whose account they were executed. Thus the Double  saw himself depicted upon the walls in the act of eating and drinking, and  he ate and drank. This notion once accepted, the theologians and artists  carried it out to the fullest extent. Not content with offering mere  pictured provisions, they added thereto the semblance of the domains which  produced them, together with the counterfeit presentment of the herds,  workmen, and slaves belonging to the same. Was a supply of meat required to  last for eternity? It was enough, no doubt, to represent the several parts  of an ox or a gazelle--the shoulder, the leg, the ribs, the breast, the  heart, the liver, the head, properly prepared for the spit; but it was  equally easy to retrace the whole history of the animal--its birth, its  life in the pasture-lands, its slaughter, the cutting up of the carcass,  and the presentation of the joints. So also as regarded the cakes and  bread-offerings, there was no reason why the whole process of tillage,  harvesting, corn-threshing, storage, and dough-kneading should not be  rehearsed. Clothing, ornaments, and furniture served in like manner as a  pretext for the introduction of spinners, weavers, goldsmiths, and cabinet-  makers. The master is of superhuman proportions, and towers above his  people and his cattle. Some prophetic tableaux show him in his funeral  bark, speeding before the wind with all sail set, having started on his way  to the next world the very day that he takes possession of his new abode  (fig. 128). Elsewhere, we see him as actively superintending his imaginary  vassals as formerly he superintended his vassals of flesh and blood (fig.  129). Varied and irregular as they may appear, these scenes are not placed  at random upon the walls. They all converge towards that semblance of a  door which was supposed to communicate with the interior of the tomb. Those  nearest to the door represent the sacrifice and the offering; the earlier  stages of preparation and preliminary work being depicted in retrograde  order as that door is left farther and farther behind. At the door itself,  the figure of the master seems to await his visitors and bid them welcome.    [Illustration: Fig. 130. Plan of serdab in mastaba at Gizeh, Fourth  Dynasty.]    The details are of infinite variety. The inscriptions run to a less or  greater length according to the caprice of the scribe; the false door loses  its architectural character, and is frequently replaced by a mere stela  engraved with the name and rank of the master; yet, whether large or small,  whether richly decorated or not decorated at all, the chapel is always the  dining-room--or, rather, the larder--to which the dead man has access when  he feels hungry.    [Illustration: Fig. 131.--Plan of serdab and chapel in mastaba of Rahotep  at Sakkarah, Fourth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 132.--Plan of serdab and chapel in mastaba of Thenti I.  at Sakkarah, Fourth Dynasty.]    On the other side of the wall was constructed a hiding-place in the form of  either a high and narrow cell, or a passage without outlet. To this hiding-  place archaeologists have given the Arab name of \"_serdab_.\" Most mastabas  contain but one; others contain three or four (fig. 130). These _serdabs_  communicated neither with each other nor with the chapel; and are, as it  were, buried in the masonry (fig. 131). If connected at all with the outer  world, it is by means of an aperture in the wall about as high up as a  man's head (fig. 132), and so small that the hand can with difficulty pass  through it. To this orifice came the priests, with murmured prayers and  perfumes of incense. Within lurked the Double, ready to profit by these  memorial rites, or to accept them through the medium of his statues. As  when he lived upon earth, the man needed a body in which to exist. His  corpse, disfigured by the process of embalmment, bore but a distant  resemblance to its former self. The mummy, again, was destructible, and  might easily be burned, dismembered, scattered to the winds. Once it had  disappeared, what was to become of the Double? The portrait statues walled  up inside the _serdab_ became, when consecrated, the stone, or wooden,  bodies of the defunct. The pious care of his relatives multiplied these  bodies, and consequently multiplied the supports of the Double. A single  body represented a single chance of existence for the Double; twenty bodies  represented twenty such chances. For the same reason, statues also of his  wife, his children, and his servants were placed with the statues of the  deceased, the servants being modelled in the act of performing their  domestic duties, such as grinding corn, kneading dough, and applying a coat  of pitch to the inside surfaces of wine-jars. As for the figures which were  merely painted on the walls of the chapel, they detached themselves, and  assumed material bodies inside the _serdab_. Notwithstanding these  precautions, all possible means were taken to guard the remains of the  fleshly body from natural decay and the depredations of the spoiler. In the  tomb of Ti, an inclined passage, starting from the middle of the first  hall, leads from the upper world to the sepulchral vault; but this is  almost a solitary exception. Generally, the vault is reached by way of a  vertical shaft constructed in the centre of the platform (fig. 133), or,  more rarely, in a corner of the chapel. The depth of this shaft varies from  10 to 100 feet. It is carried down through the masonry: it pierces the  rock; and at the bottom, a low passage, in which it is not possible to walk  upright, leads in a southward direction to the vault. There sleeps the  mummy in a massive sarcophagus of limestone, red granite, or basalt.  Sometimes, though rarely, the sarcophagus bears the name and titles of the  deceased. Still more rarely, it is decorated with ornamental sculpture.  Some examples are known which reproduce the architectural decoration of an  Egyptian house, with its doors and windows.[28] The furniture of the vault  is of the simplest character,--some alabaster perfume vases; a few cups  into which the priest had poured drops of the various libation liquids  offered to the dead; some large red pottery jars for water; a head-rest of  wood or alabaster; a scribe's votive palette. Having laid the mummy in the  sarcophagus and cemented the lid, the workmen strewed the floor of the  vault with the quarters of oxen and gazelles which had just been  sacrificed. They next carefully walled up the entrance into the passage,  and filled the shaft to the top with a mixture of sand, earth, and stone  chips. Being profusely watered, this mass solidified, and became an almost  impenetrable body of concrete. The corpse, left to itself, received no  visits now, save from the Soul, which from time to time quitted the  celestial regions wherein it voyaged with the gods, and came down to re-  unite itself with the body. The sepulchral vault was the abode of the Soul,  as the funerary chapel was the abode of the Double.    [Illustration: Fig. 133.--Section showing shaft and vault of mastaba at  Gizeh, Fourth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 134.--Section of mastaba, Sakkarah, Sixth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 135.--Wall painting of funerary offerings, from mastaba  of Nenka, Sakkarah, Sixth Dynasty.]    Up to the time of the Sixth Dynasty, the walls of the vault are left bare.  Once only did Mariette find a vault containing half-effaced inscriptions  from _The Book of the Dead_. In 1881, I however discovered some tombs at  Sakkarah, in which the vault is decorated in preference to the chapel.  These tombs are built with large bricks, a niche and a stela sufficing for  the reception of sacrificial offerings. In place of the shaft, they contain  a small rectangular court, in the western corner of which was placed the  sarcophagus. Over the sarcophagus was erected a limestone chamber just as  long and as wide as the sarcophagus itself, and about three and a half feet  high. This was roofed in with flat slabs. At the end, or in the wall to the  right, was a niche, which answered the purpose of a _serdab_; and above the  flat roof was next constructed an arch of about one foot and a half radius,  the space above the arch being filled in with horizontal courses of  brickwork up to the level of the platform. The chamber occupies about two-  thirds of the cavity, and looks like an oven with the mouth open. Sometimes  the stone walls rest on the lid of the sarcophagus, the chamber having  evidently been built after the interment had taken place (fig. 134).  Generally speaking, however, these walls rest on brick supports, so that  the sarcophagus may be opened or closed when required.

Tant Sannie shook her head.    \"Only salt, and dried peaches.\"    \"Dried peaches! Eh?\" said Bonaparte. \"Shut the door, my dear child, shut  it tight,\" he called out to Em, who stood in the dining room. Then  he leaned over the elbow of the sofa and brought his face as close as  possible to the Boer-woman's, and made signs of eating. Then he said  something she did not comprehend; then said, \"Waldo, Waldo, Waldo,\"  pointed up to the loft, and made signs of eating again.    Now an inkling of his meaning dawned on the Boer-woman's mind. To make  it clearer, he moved his legs after the manner of one going up a ladder,  appeared to be opening a door, masticated vigorously, said, \"Peaches,  peaches, peaches,\" and appeared to be coming down the ladder.    It was now evident to Tant Sannie that Waldo had been in her loft and  eaten her peaches.    To exemplify his own share in the proceedings, Bonaparte lay down on the  sofa, and shutting his eyes tightly, said, \"Night, night, night!\" Then  he sat up wildly, appearing to be intently listening, mimicked with his  feet the coming down a ladder, and looked at Tant Sannie. This clearly  showed how, roused in the night, he had discovered the theft.    \"He must have been a great fool to eat my peaches,\" said Tant Sannie.  \"They are full of mites as a sheepskin, and as hard as stones.\"    Bonaparte, fumbling in his pocket, did not even hear her remark, and  took out from his coat-tail a little horsewhip, nicely rolled up.  Bonaparte winked at the little rhinoceros horsewhip, at the Boer-woman,  and then at the door.    \"Shall we call him--Waldo, Waldo?\" he said.    Tant Sannie nodded, and giggled. There was something so exceedingly  humorous in the idea that he was going to beat the boy, though for her  own part she did not see that the peaches were worth it. When the Kaffer  maid came with the wash-tub she was sent to summon Waldo; and Bonaparte  doubled up the little whip and put it in his pocket. Then he drew  himself up, and prepared to act his important part with becoming  gravity. Soon Waldo stood in the door, and took off his hat.    \"Come in, come in, my lad,\" said Bonaparte, \"and shut the door behind.\"    The boy came in and stood before them.    \"You need not be so afraid, child,\" said Tant Sannie. \"I was a child  myself once. It's no great harm if you have taken a few.\"    Bonaparte perceived that her remark was not in keeping with the nature  of the proceedings, and of the little drama he intended to act. Pursing  out his lips, and waving his hand, he solemnly addressed the boy.    \"Waldo, it grieves me beyond expression to have to summon you for so  painful a purpose; but it is at the imperative call of duty, which I  dare not evade. I do not state that frank and unreserved confession will  obviate the necessity of chastisement, which if requisite shall be fully  administered; but the nature of that chastisement may be mitigated  by free and humble confession. Waldo, answer me as you would your own  father, in whose place I now stand to you; have you, or have you not,  did you, or did you not, eat of the peaches in the loft?\"    \"Say you took them, boy, say you took them, then he won't beat you  much,\" said the Dutchwoman, good-naturedly, getting a little sorry for  him.    The boy raised his eyes slowly and fixed them vacantly upon her, then  suddenly his face grew dark with blood.    \"So, you haven't got anything to say to us, my lad?\" said Bonaparte,  momentarily forgetting his dignity, and bending forward with a little  snarl. \"But what I mean is just this, my lad--when it takes a boy  three-quarters of an hour to fill a salt-pot, and when at three o'clock  in the morning he goes knocking about the doors of a loft, it's natural  to suppose there's mischief in it. It's certain there is mischief in it;  and where there's mischief in, it must be taken out,\" said Bonaparte,  grinning into the boy's face. Then, feeling that he had fallen from that  high gravity which was as spice to the pudding, and the flavour of the  whole little tragedy, he drew himself up. \"Waldo,\" he said, \"confess to  me instantly, and without reserve, that you ate the peaches.\"    The boy's face was white now. His eyes were on the ground, his hands  doggedly clasped before him.    \"What, do you not intend to answer?\"    The boy looked up at them once from under his bent eyebrows, and then  looked down again.    \"The creature looks as if all the devils in hell were in it,\" cried Tant  Sannie. \"Say you took them, boy. Young things will be young things; I  was older than you when I used to eat bultong in my mother's loft, and  get the little niggers whipped for it. Say you took them.\"    But the boy said nothing.    \"I think a little solitary confinement might perhaps be beneficial,\"  said Bonaparte. \"It will enable you, Waldo, to reflect on the enormity  of the sin you have committed against our Father in heaven. And you may  also think of the submission you owe to those who are older and wiser  than you are, and whose duty it is to check and correct you.\"    Saying this, Bonaparte stood up and took down the key of the fuel-house,  which hung on a nail against the wall.    \"Walk on, my boy,\" said Bonaparte, pointing to the door; and as he  followed him out he drew his mouth expressively on one side, and made  the lash of the little horsewhip stick out of his pocket and shake up  and down.    Tant Sannie felt half sorry for the lad; but she could not help  laughing, it was always so funny when one was going to have a whipping,  and it would do him good. Anyhow, he would forget all about it when the  places were healed. Had not she been beaten many times and been all the  better for it?    Bonaparte took up a lighted candle that had been left burning on the  kitchen table, and told the boy to walk before him. They went to the  fuel-house. It was a little stone erection that jutted out from the side  of the wagon-house. It was low and without a window, and the dried dung  was piled in one corner, and the coffee-mill stood in another, fastened  on the top of a short post about three feet high. Bonaparte took the  padlock off the rough door.    \"Walk in, my lad,\" he said.    Waldo obeyed sullenly; one place to him was much the same as another. He  had no objection to being locked up.    Bonaparte followed him in, and closed the door carefully. He put the  light down on the heap of dung in the corner, and quietly introduced his  hand under his coat-tails, and drew slowly from his pocket the end of a  rope, which he concealed behind him.    \"I'm very sorry, exceedingly sorry, Waldo, my lad, that you should have  acted in this manner. It grieves me,\" said Bonaparte.    He moved round toward the boy's back. He hardly liked the look in the  fellow's eyes, though he stood there motionless. If he should spring on  him!    So he drew the rope out very carefully, and shifted round to the wooden  post. There was a slipknot in one end of the rope, and a sudden movement  drew the boy's hands to his back and passed it round them. It was an  instant's work to drag it twice round the wooden post: then Bonaparte  was safe.    For a moment the boy struggled to free himself; then he knew that he was  powerless, and stood still.    \"Horses that kick must have their legs tied,\" said Bonaparte, as he  passed the other end of the rope round the boy's knees. \"And now, my  dear Waldo,\" taking the whip out of his pocket, \"I am going to beat  you.\"    He paused for a moment. It was perfectly quiet; they could hear each  other's breath.    \"'Chasten thy son while there is hope,'\" said Bonaparte, \"'and let not  thy soul spare for his crying.' Those are God's words. I shall act as a  father to you, Waldo. I think we had better have your naked back.\"    He took out his penknife, and slit the shirt down from the shoulder to  the waist.    \"Now,\" said Bonaparte, \"I hope the Lord will bless and sanctify to you  what I am going to do to you.\"    The first cut ran from the shoulder across the middle of the back; the  second fell exactly in the same place. A shudder passed through the  boy's frame.    \"Nice, eh?\" said Bonaparte, peeping round into his face, speaking with a  lisp, as though to a very little child. \"Nith, eh?\"    But the eyes were black and lustreless, and seemed not to see him. When  he had given sixteen Bonaparte paused in his work to wipe a little drop  of blood from his whip.    \"Cold, eh? What makes you shiver so? Perhaps you would like to pull up  your shirt? But I've not quite done yet.\"    When he had finished he wiped the whip again, and put it back in his  pocket. He cut the rope through with his penknife, and then took up the  light.    \"You don't seem to have found your tongue yet. Forgotten how to cry?\"  said Bonaparte, patting him on the cheek.    The boy looked up at him--not sullenly, not angrily. There was a wild,  fitful terror in the eyes. Bonaparte made haste to go out and shut the  door, and leave him alone in the darkness. He himself was afraid of that  look.    *****    It was almost morning. Waldo lay with his face upon the ground at the  foot of the fuel-heap. There was a round hole near the top of the door,  where a knot of wood had fallen out, and a stream of grey light came in  through it.    Ah, it was going to end at last. Nothing lasts forever, not even the  night. How was it he had never thought of that before? For in all that  long dark night he had been very strong, had never been tired, never  felt pain, had run on and on, up and down, up and down; he had"]]]
