Here it was decided to form a  settlement--to build houses and plant crops, that those who came after  would have food and a stopping place. The settlement was called Garden  Grove. Soon it was as lively as a hive of bees. Hundreds of men were busy  making fence rails and fences, building houses, digging wells, clearing  land, and plowing. Meetings were held often and the people were instructed  and encouraged. Parley P. Pratt and a small company were sent ahead to find  another location for a settlement. They found a beautiful place about  thirty miles from Garden Grove, which they called Mount Pisgah. Here houses  were also built, and farms and gardens planted. As many of the Saints were  poor and sick they rested at these two settlements while the main body went  on.    From Mount Pisgah the country was wild Indian lands, there being no white  settlements or roads. The spring rains had now moderated so that the roads  were better. On June 14th President Young and the leading companies arrived  at the Missouri river, where a stop was made. Most of the companies came up  in July. A camp was made on the east side of the river on some high land  called Council Bluffs.    This was on Indian land, but the travelers were received kindly and given  permission to stop.    President Young intended to send a body of picked men into the Rocky  Mountains as soon as possible to locate a gathering place. They were to  push on ahead that summer and put in crops. Arrangements were being made  to this end, when something happened that put a stop to the plan. This was  the call for the Mormon Battalion, about which I will tell you in the next  chapter.    After five hundred of their best men had marched away to fight the battles  of their country, it was impossible for the Saints to get to the mountains  that year. So it was decided to make a third stopping place and remain  there during the winter.    There being a good location for a town on the west bank of the Missouri  river, that place was selected and named Winter Quarters. The town was laid  out regularly into streets, and log houses were built. Some made dugouts in  the sides of the hill, which were quite comfortable during the cold winter.  As the Indians were troublesome on that side of the river a stockade was  built around the town. By December, 1846, five hundred and thirty-eight log  houses and eighty-three sod houses were built, inhabited by three thousand  four hundred and eighty-three people. The town was divided into twenty-two  wards, each presided over by a bishop. A large log house was built in which  meetings and parties were held.    The food of the people that winter consisted largely of corn-bread and  pork. President Young had a grist mill built, but before that time many ate  boiled wheat, and ground their corn in coffee mills.    Because of hardships and poor food there was much sickness at all the  settlements. Graves marked the prairie for hundreds of miles. At Winter  Quarters alone over six hundred were buried.    The poor Saints who were left at Nauvoo were not forgotten. After they had  been driven from Nauvoo, they were met by teams from Winter Quarters, and  all who wished to go were taken to the camps of the Saints.    Perhaps you may get an idea of this great move when you are told that  during that summer there were about two thousand wagons and ten thousand  Saints on the way between Nauvoo and Council Bluffs.

During the summer of 1846 the United States was at war with the republic of  Mexico. A number of battles had been fought in Texas. What is now  California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona belonged to Mexico, and as President  Polk desired to get this large district of country for the United States,  he sent soldiers westward to the Pacific ocean.    The \"Mormon\" people traveling from Nauvoo had asked President Polk for  assistance in their journey to the west. They said they wanted to remain  under the protection of the government, and were willing to aid in holding  the western country for the United States.    In the month of June, 1846, Captain James Allen, an officer of the United  States army arrived at Mount Pisgah, Iowa. What he wanted was five hundred  men with which to form a battalion and march across the continent to  California, and take part in the war with Mexico.    This was startling news indeed. The Saints had not expected this kind of  \"help\" in their journeying through the wilderness. Many of the Saints  looked upon the call as a plan to destroy them. You can hardly blame them  for that, can you, knowing some of their past history?    But President Young and the leading brethren told the officer he should  have his men. They thought it was a test to see if they were true to their  country. Though it was a pretty hard test, thus to take their best and  strongest men away from such a camp as theirs, yet the \"Mormon\" people  would show to the government and to the whole world that they were loyal to  their country, even though that country had failed to protect them in their  rights to live in peace and worship God.    At a meeting held at Council Bluffs it was decided to raise the men asked  for. Brigham Young and the Twelve took an active part in getting  volunteers. Word was sent to the different settlements of the Saints. The  stars and stripes were hoisted to a tree top, and the work of enrollment  began. Within three days the little army was organized and ready for the  march. Then they had a grand farewell party, held, not in some beautifully  lighted ball room, but in a bowery, where the ground had been packed hard  by the tread of many feet. There fathers and mothers and brothers and  sisters and sweethearts said their goodbyes to each other.    And then the long, dreary march began. The story of that march would fill  a book, so of course very little of it can be told here. If you would like  to read more about it, you will find it in Brother Tyler's \"History of the  Mormon Battalion.\"    There were five hundred and forty-nine souls in the Battalion. Captain  James Allen was the commander. They started on their march July 20, 1846,  to Fort Leavenworth, where they received their guns and other things  necessary for an army. At this point Captain Allen died, which made the men  feel bad, as he was a good, kind officer.    The Battalion began to move from Fort Leavenworth on the 12th of August.  You may see their line of march by looking at the map on page 128. After  suffering much hardship, they reached Santa Fe, October 9th. Here Colonel  Cooke took the command. As many of the soldiers as were too sick to go on  were sent to Pueblo, where they remained all winter, and traveled to Salt  Lake valley the next summer. The main body of the Battalion left Santa Fe,  October 19th, for California. At Tucson they expected to have a battle with  some Mexican soldiers, and prepared for it, but they marched through the  city without being disturbed. From Tucson they continued over the deserts,  and arrived at San Diego, January 29, 1847, where they saw the broad, blue,  ocean, many of them for the first time.    The Battalion remained in and around San Diego for about two weeks. As  there was no fighting to be done, the men built houses, dug wells, made  brick, and helped build up the town. On March 19th most of them marched to  Los Angeles, and on the 16th of July they were mustered out, having served  their full time--one year.    Of this great march Colonel Cooke their commander wrote:    \"History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry;  nine-tenths of it through a wilderness, where nothing but savages and wild  beasts are found, or deserts, where for want of water, there is no living  creature. There, with almost hopeless labor we have dug deep wells. Without  a guide we have crossed the wilderness, we have ventured into trackless  prairies, where water was not found for several marches. With crowbar and  pickax in hand we have worked our way over mountains, which seemed to defy  aught but the wild goat, and hewed a passage through a chasm of rock, more  narrow than our wagons.\"    After their release, most of the men took up their march for home. Perhaps  it would be more correct to say to find their families and friends, as they  did not have any home yet. They journeyed northward in California and then  crossed the mountains to Salt Lake valley where most of them arrived in  October, 1847. From there many went right on to Winter Quarters to their  families.    A number of the Battalion men remained in California to earn a little  money. Some got work with a Captain Sutter who had a large ranch on the  American fork of the Sacramento river. The \"Mormons\" with some others were  set to work building a mill, and it was here while digging in the mill race  that gold was discovered in California. Some of the brethren carried away a  few hundred dollars' worth when they went to Salt Lake Valley the next  summer.    Topics.--1. The call for the Mormon Battalion. 2. Its march. 3.

He would be immediately exposed  to an attack from this quarter as soon as it should be known that he  was at Ethelney, as the distance across the Channel was not great, and  the Danes were provided with shipping.    Ethelney was in the county called Somersetshire. To the southwest  of Somersetshire, a little below it, on the shores of the Bristol  Channel, was a castle, called Castle Kenwith, in Devonshire. The  Duke of Devonshire, who held this castle, encouraged by Alfred's  preparations for action, had assembled a considerable force here, to  be ready to co-operate with Alfred in the active measures which he was  about to adopt. Things being in this state, Hubba brought down his  forces to the northern shores of the Channel, collected together all  the boats and shipping that he could command, crossed the Channel,  and landed on the Devonshire shore. Odun, the duke, not being strong  enough to resist, fled, and shut himself up, with all his men, in the  castle. Hubba advanced to the castle walls, and, sitting down before  them, began to consider what to do.    Hubba was the last surviving son of Ragner Lodbrog, whose deeds and  adventures were related in a former chapter. He was, like all other  chieftains among the Danes, a man of great determination and energy,  and he had made himself very celebrated all over the land by his  exploits and conquests. His particular horde of marauders, too, was  specially celebrated among all the others, on account of a mysterious  and magical banner which they bore. The name of this banner was the  _Reafan_, that is, the Raven. There was the figure of a raven woven  or embroidered on the banner. Hubba's three sisters had woven it for  their brothers, when they went forth across the German Ocean to avenge  their father's death. It possessed, as both the Danes and Saxons  believed, supernatural and magical powers. The raven on the banner  could foresee the result of any battle into which it was borne. It  remained lifeless and at rest whenever the result was to be adverse;  and, on the other hand, it fluttered its wings with a mysterious and  magical vitality when they who bore it were destined to victory. The  Danes consequently looked up to this banner with a feeling of profound  veneration and awe, and the Saxons feared and dreaded its mysterious  power. The explanation of this pretended miracle is easy. The  imagination of superstitious men, in such a state of society as that  of these half-savage Danes, is capable of much greater triumphs over  the reason and the senses than is implied in making them believe that  the wings of a bird are either in motion or at rest, whichever  it fancies, when the banner on which the image is embroidered is  advancing to the field and fluttering in the breeze.    The Castle of Kenwith was situated on a rocky promontory, and was  defended by a Saxon wall. Hubba saw that it would be difficult to  carry it by a direct assault. On the other hand, it was not well  supplied with water or provisions, and the numerous multitude which  had crowded into it, would, as Hubba thought, be speedily compelled  to surrender by thirst and famine, if he were simply to wait a short  time, till their scanty stock of food was consumed. Perhaps the raven  did not flutter her wings when Hubba approached the castle, but by her  apparent lifelessness portended calamity if an attack were to be made.  At all events, Hubba decided not to attack the castle, but to invest  it closely on all sides, with his army on the land and with his  vessels on the side of the sea, and thus reduce it by famine. He  accordingly stationed his troops and his galleys at their posts and  established himself in his tent, quietly to await the result.    He did not have to wait so long as he anticipated. Odun, finding that  his danger was so imminent, nay, that his destruction was inevitable  if he remained in his castle, thus shut in, determined, in the  desperation to which the emergency reduced him, to make a sally.  Accordingly, one night, as soon as it was dark, so that the  indications of any movement within the castle might not be perceived  by the sentinels and watchmen in Hubba's lines, he began to marshal  and organize his army for a sudden and furious onset upon the camp of  the Danes.    They waited, when all was ready, till the first break of day. To make  the surprise most effectual, it was necessary that it should take  place in the night; but then, on the other hand, the success, if they  should be successful, would require, in order to be followed up with  advantage, the light of day. Odun chose, therefore, the earliest dawn  as the time for his attempt, as this was the only period which would  give him at first darkness for his surprise, and afterward light for  his victory. The time was well chosen, the arrangements were all  well made, and the result corresponded with the character of the  preparations. The sally was triumphantly successful.    The Danes, who were all, except their sentinels, sleeping quietly and  secure, were suddenly aroused by the unearthly and terrific yells with  which the Saxons burst into the lines of their encampment. They flew  to arms, but the shock of the onset produced a panic and confusion  which soon made their cause hopeless. Odun and his immediate followers  pressed directly forward into Hubba's tent, where they surprised the  commander, and massacred him on the spot. They seized, too, to their  inexpressible joy, the sacred banner, which was in Hubba's tent, and  bore it forth, rejoicing in it, not merely as a splendid trophy of  their victory, but as a loss to their enemies which fixed and sealed  their doom.    The Danes fled before their enemies in terror, and the consternation  which they felt, when they learned that their banner had been captured  and their leader slain, was soon changed into absolute despair. The  Saxons slew them without mercy, cutting down some as they were running  before them in their headlong flight, and transfixing others with  their spears and arrows as they lay upon the ground, trampled down by  the crowds and the confusion. There was no place of refuge to which  they could fly except to their ships. Those, therefore, that escaped  the weapons of their pursuers, fled in the direction of the water,  where the strong and the fortunate gained the boats and the galleys,  while the exhausted and the wounded were drowned. The fleet sailed  away from the coast, and the Saxons, on surveying the scene of the  terrible contest, estimated that there were twelve hundred dead bodies  lying in the field.    This victory, and especially the capture of the Raven, produced vast  effects on the minds both of the Saxons and of the Danes, animating  and encouraging the one, and depressing the other with superstitious  as well as natural and proper fears. The influence of the battle was  sufficient, in fact, wholly to change Alfred's position and prospects.  The news of the discovery of the place of his retreat, and of the  measures which he was maturing for taking the field again to meet his  enemies, spread throughout the country. The people were every where  ready to take up arms and join him. There were large bodies of Danes  in several parts of his dominions still, and they, alarmed somewhat at  these indications of new efforts of resistance on the part of their  enemies, began to concentrate their strength and prepare for another  struggle.    The main body of the Danes were encamped at a place called Edendune,  in Wiltshire. There is a hill near, which the army made their main  position, and the marks of their fortifications have been traced  there, either in imagination or reality, in modern times. Alfred  wished to gain more precise and accurate information than he yet  possessed of the numbers and situation of his foes; and, in order to  do this, instead of employing a spy, he conceived the design of going  himself in disguise to explore the camp of the Danes. The undertaking  was full of danger, but yet not quite so desperate as at first it  might seem. Alfred had had abundant opportunities during the months  of his seclusion to become familiar with the modes of speech and the  manners of peasant life. He had also, in his early years, stored his  memory with Saxon poetry, as has already been stated. He was fond of  music, too, and well skilled in it; so that he had every qualification  for assuming the character of one of those roving harpers, who, in  those days, followed armies, to sing songs and make amusement for the  soldiers. He determined, consequently, to assume the disguise of a  harper, and to wander into the camp of the Danes, that he might make  his own observations on the nature and magnitude of the force with  which he was about to contend.    He accordingly clothed himself in the garb of the character which he  was to assume, and, taking his harp upon his shoulder, wandered away  in the direction of the Northmen's camp. Such a strolling countryman,  half musician, half beggar would enter without suspicion or hinderance  into the camp, even though he belonged to the nation of the enemy.  Alfred was readily admitted, and he wandered at will about the  lines, to play and sing to the soldiers wherever he found groups to  listen--intent, apparently, on nothing but his scanty pittance of pay,  while he was really studying, with the utmost attention and care, the  number, and disposition, and discipline of the troops, and all the  arrangements of the army. He came very near discovering himself,  however, by overacting his part. His music was so well executed and  his ballads were so fine, that reports of the excellence of his  performance reached the commander's ears. He ordered the pretended  harper to be sent into his tent, that he might hear him play and  sing. Alfred went, and thus he had the opportunity of completing his  observations in the tent, and in the presence of the Danish king.   "]]]
