THE RIG VEDA (CONTINUED).--THE MIDDLE GODS.      Only one of the great atmospheric deities, the gods that preeminently  govern the middle sphere between sky and earth, can claim an Aryan  lineage. One of the minor gods of the same sphere, the ancient  rain-god, also has this antique dignity, but in his case the dignity  already is impaired by the strength of a new and greater rival. In the  case of the wind-god, on the other hand, there is preserved a deity  who was one of the primitive pantheon, belonging, perhaps, not only to  the Iranians, but to the Teutons, for V[=a]ta, Wind, may be the  Scandinavian Woden. The later mythologists on Indian soil make a  distinction between V[=a]ta, wind, and V[=a]yu (from the same root; as  in German _wehen_) and in this distinction one discovers that the old  V[=a]ta, who must have been once _the_ wind-god, is now reduced to  physical (though sentient) wind, while the newer name represents the  higher side of wind as a power lying back of phenomena; and it is this  latter conception alone that is utilized in the formation of the Vedic  triad of wind, fire, and sun. In short, in the use and application of  the two names, there is an exact parallel to the double terminology  employed to designate the sun as S[=u]rya and Savitar. Just as  S[=u]rya is the older [Greek: helios] and sol (acknowledged as a god,  yet palpably the physical red body in the sky) contrasted with the  interpretation which, by a newer name (Savitar), seeks to  differentiate the (sentient) physical from the spiritual, so is  V[=a]ta, Woden, replaced and lowered by the loftier conception of  V[=a]yu. But, again, just as, when the conception of Savitar is  formed, the spiritualizing tendency reverts to S[=u]rya, and makes of  him, too, a figure reclothed in the more modern garb of speech, which  is invented for Savitar alone; so the retroactive theosophic fancy,  after creating V[=a]yu as a divine power underlying phenomenal  V[=a]ta, reinvests V[=a]ta also with the garments of V[=a]yu. Thus,  finally, the two, who are the result of intellectual differentiation,  are again united from a new point of view, and S[=u]rya or Savitar,  V[=a]yu or V[=a]ta, are indifferently used to express respectively the  whole completed interpretation of the divinity, which is now visible  and invisible, sun and sun-god, wind and wind-god. In these pairs  there is, as it were, a perspective of Hindu theosophy, and one can  trace the god, as a spiritual entity including the physical, back to  the physical prototype that once was worshipped as such alone.    In the Rig Veda there are three complete hymns to Wind, none of these  being in the family books. In x. 186, the poet calls on Wind to bring  health to the worshipper, and to prolong his life. He addresses Wind  as 'father and brother and friend,' asking the power that blows to  bring him ambrosia, of which Wind has a store. These are rather pretty  verses without special theological intent, addressed more to Wind as  such than to a spiritual power. The other hymn from the same book is  directed to V[=a]ta also, not to V[=a]yu, and though it is loftier in  tone and even speaks of V[=a]ta as the soul of the gods, yet is it  evident that no consistent mythology has worked upon the purely poetic  phraseology, which is occupied merely with describing the rushing of a  mighty wind (x. 168). Nevertheless, V[=a]ta is worshipped, as is  V[=a]yu, with oblations.        HYMN TO WIND (V[=a]ta).      Now V[=a]ta's chariot's greatness! Breaking goes it,    And thundering is its noise; to heaven it touches,    Goes o'er the earth, cloud[1] making, dust up-rearing;    Then rush together all the forms of V[=a]ta;    To him they come as women to a meeting.    With them conjoint, on the same chariot going,    Is born the god, the king of all creation.    Ne'er sleepeth he when, on his pathway wandering,    He goes through air. The friend is he of waters;    First-born and holy,--where was he created,    And whence arose he? Spirit of gods is V[=a]ta,    Source of creation, goeth where he listeth;    Whose sound is heard, but not his form. This V[=a]ta    Let us with our oblations duly honor.    In times later than the Rig Veda, V[=a]yu interchanges with Indra as  representative of the middle sphere; and in the Rig Veda all the hymns  of the family books associate him with Indra (vii. 90-92; iv. 47-48).  In the first book he is associated thus in the second hymn; while, ib.  134, he has the only remaining complete hymn, though fragments of  songs occasionally are found. All of these hymns except the first two  simply invite V[=a]yu to come with Indra to the sacrifice, It is  V[=a]yu who with Indra obtains the first drink of soma (i. 134. 6). He  is spoken of as the artificer's, Tvashtar's, son-in-law, but the  allusion is unexplained (viii. 26. 22); he in turn begets the  storm-gods (i. 134. 4).    With V[=a]yu is joined Indra, one of the popular gods. These  divinities, which are partly of the middle and partly of the lower  sphere, may be called the popular gods, yet were the title 'new gods'  neither wholly amiss nor quite correct. For, though the popular  deities in general, when compared with many for whom a greater  antiquity may be claimed, such as the Sun,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#19)"],[1," them an orderly exit might have been  conducted had reason not given place to unreason. It is the task of  those responsible for the children's education to guide them without  wild struggling along the paths of well-regulated conduct towards the  desired goal, influenced not by the emotions of the moment, but only  by reason and a sense of right; not ignorant of the difficulties to be  met, but practised and equipped to overcome them.    It is easy thus to state in general terms the objects of education,  and the need for discipline. To apply these principles to the  individual is a task, the immeasurable difficulty of which we are only  beginning to appreciate with the failure of thirty years of compulsory  education before us. A recent writer[2] gives it as his opinion that  the aim of education is to equip a child with ideals, and that this  task should not be difficult, because the lower savages successfully  subject all the members of their tribe to the most ruthless  discipline. Their lives, he says, \"are lived in fear, in restraint, in  submission, in suffering, subject to galling, unreasoning,  unnecessary, arbitrary prohibitions and taboos, and to customary  duties equally galling, unreasoning, unnecessary, and arbitrary. They  endure painful mutilations, they submit to painful sacrifices.... How  are these wild, unstable, wayward, impulsive, passionate natures  brought to submit to such a rigorous and cruel discipline? By  education; by the inculcation from infancy of these ideals. In these  ideals they have been brought up, and to them they cling with the  utmost tenacity.\" One might as well contend that it was easy to teach  all men to live the self-denying life of earnest Christians because  some savage tribe was successful in maintaining among its members a  universal and orthodox worship of idols. The ideals set before the  child are too high and too complex to be inculcated by physical force,  or even by force of public opinion. A rigid discipline, with many  stripes and with terrible threats of a still worse punishment in the  world to come, was the almost invariable lot of children until the  last century was well advanced. Yet has this drastic treatment of  young children fulfilled its purpose? Were the men of fifty years ago  better conducted and more controlled than the men of to-day? In any  one family did a greater proportion turn out well? Is it not true that  at least among the educated classes the relaxation of nursery and  schoolroom discipline which the last fifty years has seen has been  justified by its results? Is it not true that the childhood of our  grandmothers was often lived \"in fear, in restraint, in submission, in  suffering subject to galling, unreasoning, unnecessary, arbitrary  prohibitions and taboos, and to customary duties equally galling,  unreasoning, unnecessary, and arbitrary.\" And though perhaps the  grandmothers of most of us may not have been much the worse for all  this discipline, is it not true that of the little brothers who shared  the nursery with them a surprising number broke straightway into  dissipation when the parental restraints were removed? If we are to  teach a child to be gentle to the weak it is not wise to beat him. The  qualities which we wish him to possess are not more subtle than the  means by which we must aid him to their possession.    [Footnote 2: _The Principles of Rational Education_, by Dr. C.A.  Mercier.]    Education comprises physical, mental, and moral training. In earlier  times physical strength and the power to fight well, alone were prized  and were the chief objects to be gained in the education of youth.  Later, under the stress of intellectual competition for success in  life, mental acquirements have come to occupy the first place. We are  only now learning to lay emphasis upon the supreme need for moral  training. Not that it is possible to separate the sum of education  into its constituent parts, and to regard each as distinct from the  others. That many men of great intellectual activity, and many men  pre-eminent for their moral qualities have harboured a great brain or  a noble character in a weakly or deformed body, forms no argument to  disprove the general rule that a healthy, vigorous physique is the  only sure foundation upon which to build a highly developed intellect  and a stable temperament. In childhood the intimate connection between  vigour of mind and vigour of body is almost always clearly shown. A  child with rickets, unable to exercise his body in free play, as a  rule shows a flabbiness of mind in keeping with his useless muscles  and yielding bones. Such children talk late, are infantile in their  habits and ways of thought, and are more emotional and unstable than  healthy children of the same age. The connection between bodily  ailments and instability of nervous control is even more clearly seen  in the frequent combination of rheumatism and chorea. A very high  proportion of older children suffering from the graver neuroses, such  as chorea, syncopal attacks, phobias, tics, and so forth, show  defective physical development. Scoliosis, lordosis, knock-knee, flat  foot, pigeon chest, albuminuria, cold and cyanosed extremities, are  the rule rather than the exception. If the body of the child is  developed to the greatest perfection of which it is capable we shall  not often find a too sensitive nervous system. The boy of fine  physique may have many faults. He may be bad-tempered or untruthful or  selfish, but such faults as he has are as a rule more primitive in  type, more readily traced to their causes, and more easy to eradicate  than the faults which spring from that timidity, instability, and  moral flabbiness which has so often developed in the lax delicate  child reared softly in mind and body.      PHYSICAL TRAINING    Children thrive best in the healthy open-air life of the country, and  if there is any tendency to nervous disturbances the need for this  becomes insistent. Physical training, further, includes the manual  education of the child. The system of child-training advocated by Dr.  Montessori is based upon the cultivation of tactile sensations and the  development of manual dexterity. Exercises such as she has devised  have an immediate effect in calming the nervous system and in changing  the restless or irritable child into a self-restrained and eager  worker. Lord Macaulay, whose phenomenal memory as a child has become  proverbial, was so extraordinarily unhandy that throughout life he had  considerable difficulty in putting on his gloves, while he had such  trouble with shaving that on his return from India there were found in  his luggage some fifty razors, none of which retained any edge, and  nearly as many strops which had been cut to pieces in his irritated  and ineffectual efforts. If we teach a child manual dexterity it is an  advantage to him, because manual dexterity is seldom associated with  restlessness and irritability of mind. To excel in some handicraft not  only bespeaks the possession of self-control, it helps directly to  cultivate it. The teaching of Froebel and Montessori holds good after  nursery days are over.      MENTAL TRAINING    Mental training enables the child to retain facts in his memory, to  obtain information from as many sources as possible, to understand and  piece them together, and finally to reach fresh conclusions from  previously acquired data. So far as is possible the teacher must  satisfy the natural desire to know the reason of things. It must be  his endeavour to prevent the child from accepting any argument which  he has not fully understood, and which, as a result, he is able not to  reconstruct but only to repeat. Mental work which is slovenly and  perfunctory is as harmful to the child's education as mechanical work  which is bungled and ineffective. Taking advantage of his natural  aptitudes, his interest should be developed and extended in every way  possible. Tasks which are accomplished without enthusiasm are labour  expended in vain, because the knowledge so acquired is not  assimilated and adds nothing to the child's mental growth. There  should be no sharp differentiation between work and play.      MORAL TRAINING    Moral training depends upon the force of example rather than of  precept. Parents must be scrupulously just and truthful to the child,  for his quick perception will detect the slightest deceit, and the  evil impression made on his mind may be lasting. They must confidently  expect conduct from him of a high moral standard, and be careful at  this early age to avoid the common fault of giving a dog a bad name.  If it is said on all sides that a child has an uncontrollable temper,  is an inveterate grumbler, is lacking in all power of concentration,  or has a tendency to deceit, it is likely that the child will act up  to his reputation. He comes in time to regard this failing of his as  part of himself just as much as is the colour of his hair or the  length of his legs. It may be said of a schoolboy that he shows no  aptitude for his work. Term by term the same report is brought home  from school, and each serves only to confirm the boy in his belief  that this failing is part of his nature, and that no effort of his own  can correct it. If one subject only has escaped the condemnation of  his master, then it may be to that study alone that he returns with  zest and enjoyment. Spendthrift sons are manufactured by those fathers  who many times a day proclaim that the boy has no notion of the value  of money.    And so with children! Parents must take it for granted that they will  display all the virtues they desire in them. They must trust to their  honour always to speak the truth, and always to do their best in work  or play whether they are with them or not. Again and again the  children will fail and their patience will be tried to the utmost.  They must explain how serious is the fault, and"]]]
