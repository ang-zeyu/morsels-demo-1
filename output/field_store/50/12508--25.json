When he got there  his two brothers were off to some sports for a while; and the King was  glad to see his youngest son, and very anxious to taste his apples. But  when he found out that they were not good, and thought that they were  more for poisoning him, he sent immediately for the headsman to behead  his youngest son, who was taken away there and then in a carriage. But  instead of the headsman taking his head off, he took him to a forest not  far from the town, because he had pity on him, and there left him to  take his chance, when presently up comes a big hairy bear, limping upon  three legs. The Prince, poor fellow, climbed up a tree, frightened of  him, but the bear told him to come down, that it was no use of him to  stop there. With hard persuasion poor Jack comes down, and the bear  speaks to him and bids him \"Come here to me; I will not do you any harm.  It's better for you to come with me and have some refreshments; I know  that you are hungry all this time.\"    The poor young Prince says, \"No, I am not hungry; but I was very  frightened when I saw you coming to me first, as I had no place to run  away from you.\"    The bear said, \"I was also afraid of you when I saw that gentleman  setting you down from the carriage. I thought you would have guns with  you, and that you would not mind killing me if you saw me; but when I  saw the gentleman going away with the carriage, and leaving you behind  by yourself, I made bold to come to you, to see who you were, and now I  know who you are very well. Are you not the king's youngest son? I have  seen you and your brothers and lots of other gentlemen in this wood many  times. Now before we go from here, I must tell you that I am in  disguise; and I shall take you where we are stopping.\"    The young Prince tells him everything from first to last, how he started  in search of the apples, and about the three old men, and about the  castle, and how he was served at last by his father after he came home;  and instead of the headsman taking his head off, he was kind enough to  leave him his life, \"and here I am now, under your protection.\"    The bear tells him, \"Come on, my brother; there shall no harm come to  you as long as you are with me.\"    So he takes him up to the tents; and when they see 'em coming, the girls  begin to laugh, and say, \"Here is our Jubal coming with a young  gentleman.\" When he advanced nearer the tents, they all knew that he was  the young Prince that had passed by that way many times before; and when  Jubal went to change himself, he called most of them together into one  tent, and told them all about him, and to be kind to him. And so they  were, for there was nothing that he desired but what he had, the same as  if he was in the palace with his father and mother. Jubal, after he  pulled off his hairy coat, was one of the finest young men amongst them,  and he was the young Prince's closest companion. The young Prince was  always very sociable and merry, only when he thought of the gold watch  he had from the young Princess in the castle, and which he had lost he  knew not where.    He passed off many happy days in the forest; but one day he and poor  Jubal were strolling through the trees, when they came to the very spot  where they first met, and, accidentally looking up, he could see his  watch hanging in the tree which he had to climb when he first saw poor  Jubal coming to him in the form of a bear; and he cries out, \"Jubal,  Jubal, I can see my watch up in that tree.\"    \"Well, I am sure, how lucky!\" exclaimed poor Jubal; \"shall I go and get  it down?\"    \"No, I'd rather go myself,\" said the young Prince.    Now whilst all this was going on, the young Princess in that castle,  seeing that one of the King of England's sons had been there by the  changing of the watch and other things, got herself ready with a large  army, and sailed off for England. She left her army a little out of the  town, and she went with her guards straight up to the palace to see the  King, and also demanded to see his sons. They had a long conversation  together about different things. At last she demands one of the sons to  come before her; and the oldest comes, when she asks him, \"Have you ever  been at the Castle of Melvales?\" and he answers, \"Yes.\" She throws down  a pocket handkerchief and bids him to walk over it without stumbling. He  goes to walk over it, and no sooner did he put his foot on it, than he  fell down and broke his leg. He was taken off immediately and made a  prisoner of by her own guards. The other was called upon, and was asked  the same questions, and I had to go through the same performance, and he  also was made a prisoner of. Now she says, \"Have you not another son?\"  when the King began so to shiver and shake and knock his two knees  together that he could scarcely stand upon his legs, and did not know  what to say to her, he was so much frightened. At last a thought came to  him to send for his headsman, and inquire of him particularly, Did he  behead his son, or was he alive?    \"He is saved, O King.\"    \"Then bring him here immediately, or else I shall be done for.\"    Two of the fastest horses they had were put in the carriage, to go and  look for the poor Prince; and when they got to the very spot where they  left him, it was the time when the Prince was up the tree, getting his  watch down, and poor Jubal standing a distance off. They cried out to  him, Had he seen another young man in this wood? Jubal, seeing such a  nice carriage, thought something, and did not like to say No, and said  Yes, and pointed up the tree; and they told him to come down  immediately, as there was a young lady in search of him.    \"Ha! ha! ha! Jubal, did you ever hear such a thing in all your life, my  brother?\"    \"Do you call him your brother?\"    \"Well, he has been better to me than my brothers.\"    \"Well, for his kindness he shall accompany you to the palace, and see  how things turn out.\"    After they go to the palace, the Prince has a good wash, and appears  before the Princess, when she asks him, Had he ever been at the Castle  of Melvales? With a smile upon his face, he gives a graceful bow. And  says my Lady, \"Walk over that handkerchief without stumbling.\" He walks  over it many times, and dances upon it, and nothing happened to him. She  said, with a proud and smiling air, \"That is the young man;\" and out  come the objects exchanged by both of them. Presently she orders a very  large box to be brought in and to be opened, and out come some of the  most costly uniforms that were ever worn on an emperor's back; and when  he dressed himself up, the King could scarcely look upon him from the  dazzling of the gold and diamonds on his coat. He orders his two  brothers to be in confinement for a period of time; and before the  Princess asks him to go with her to her own country, she pays a visit to  the bear's camp, and she makes some very handsome presents for their  kindness to the young Prince. And she gives Jubal an invitation to go  with them, which he accepts; wishes them a hearty farewell for a while,  promising to see them all again in some little time.    They go back to the King and bid farewell, and tell him not to be so  hasty another time to order people to be beheaded before having a proper  cause for it. Off they go with all their army with them; but while the  soldiers were striking their tents, the Prince bethought himself of his  Welsh harp, and had it sent for immediately to take with him in a  beautiful wooden case. They called to see each of those three brothers  whom the Prince had to stay with when he was on his way to the Castle of  Melvales; and I can assure you, when they all got together, they had a  very merry time of it. And there we will leave them.          King John and the Abbot of Canterbury      In the reign of King John there lived an Abbot of Canterbury who kept up  grand state in his Abbey. A hundred of the Abbot's men dined each day  with him in his refectory, and fifty knights in velvet coats and gold  chains waited upon him daily. Well, King John, as you know, was a very  bad king, and he couldn't brook the idea of any one in his kingdom,  however holy he might be, being honoured more than he. So he summoned  the Abbot of Canterbury to his presence.    The Abbot came with a goodly retinue, with his fifty knights-at-arms in  velvet cloaks and gold chains. The King went to meet him, and said to  him, \"How now, father Abbot? I hear it of thee, thou keepest far greater  state than I. This becomes not our royal dignity, and savours of treason  in thee.\"    \"My liege,\" quoth the Abbot, bending low, \"I beg to say that all I spend  has been freely given to the Abbey out of the piety of the folk. I trust  your Grace will not take it ill that I spend for the Abbey's sake what  is the Abbey's.\"    \"Nay, proud prelate,\" answered the King, \"all that is in this fair realm  of England is our own, and thou hast no right to put me to shame by  holding such state. However, of my clemency I will spare thee thy life  and thy property if you can answer me but three questions.\"    \"I will do so, my liege,\" said the Abbot, \"so far as my poor wit can  extend.\"    \"Well, then,\" said the King, \"tell me where is the centre of all the  world round; then let me know how soon can I ride the whole world about;  and, lastly, tell me what I think.\"    \"Your Majesty jesteth,\" stammered the Abbot.    \"Thou wilt find it no jest,\" said the King. \"Unless thou canst answer me  these questions three before a week is out, thy head will leave thy  body;\" and he turned away.    Well, the Abbot rode off in fear and trembling, and first he went to  Oxford to see if any learned doctor could tell him the answer to those  questions three; but none could help him, and he took his way to  Canterbury, sad and sorrowful, to take leave of his monks.

Standing with your back to the  object and your painting, hold this glass close in front of one of your  eyes (the other being closed), so that you can see both your painting  and the object. Seeing the tones thus reduced and simplified, you will  be enabled more easily to correct your work.    I should like to emphasise the importance of the setting-out work  necessary for brush-drawing. While it is not necessary to put expressive  work into this preparatory work, the utmost care should be taken to  ensure its accuracy as far as it goes. It is a great nuisance if, after  you have put up some of your fair structure, you find the foundations  are in the wrong place and the whole thing has to be torn down and  shifted. It is of the utmost necessity to have the proportions and the  main masses settled at this early stage, and every device of blocking  out with square lines and measuring with your knitting-needle, &c.,  should be adopted to ensure the accuracy of these large proportions. The  variations and emphases that feeling may dictate can be done in the  painting stage. This initial stage is not really a drawing at all, but a  species of mapping out, and as such it should be regarded. The only  excuse for making the elaborate preparatory drawings on canvas students  sometimes do, is that it enables them to learn the subject, so that when  they come to paint it, they already know something about it. But the  danger of making these preparatory drawings interesting is that the  student fears to cover them up and lose an outline so carefully and  lovingly wrought; and this always results in a poor painting. When you  take up a brush to express yourself, it must be with no fear of hurting  a careful drawing. Your drawing is going to be done with the brush, and  only the general setting out of the masses will be of any use to you in  the work of this initial stage. Never paint with the poor spirit of the  student who fears to lose his drawing, or you will never do any fine  things in painting. Drawing (expressing form) is the thing you should be  doing all the time. And in art, \"he that would save his work must often  lose it,\" if you will excuse the paraphrase of a profound saying which,  like most profound sayings, is applicable to many things in life besides  what it originally referred to. It is often necessary when a painting is  #nearly# right to destroy the whole thing in order to accomplish the  apparently little that still divides it from what you conceive it should  be. It is like a man rushing a hill that is just beyond the power of his  motor-car to climb, he must take a long run at it. And if the first  attempt lands him nearly up at the top but not #quite#, he has to go  back and take the long run all over again, to give him the impetus that  shall carry him right through.    Another method of judging tone drawing is our old method of half closing  the eyes. This, by lowering the tone and widening the focus, enables you  to correct the work more easily.    In tone drawing there is not only the shape of the masses to be  considered, but their values--that is, their position in an imagined  scale from dark to light. The relation of the different tones in this  way--the values, as it is called--is an extremely important matter in  painting. But it more properly belongs to the other department of the  subject, namely Colour, and this needs a volume to itself. But something  more will be said on this subject when treating of Rhythm.    We saw, in speaking of line drawing, how the character of a line was  found by observing its flatnesses and its relation to straight lines. In  the same way #the character of modelling is found by observing its  planes#. So that in building up a complicated piece of form, like a head  or figure, the planes (or flat tones) should be sought for everywhere.  As a carver in stone blocks out his work in square surfaces, the  modelling of a figure or any complex surface that is being studied  should be set out in planes of tone, painting in the first instance the  larger ones, and then, to these, adding the smaller; when it will be  seen that the roundnesses have, with a little fusing of edges here and  there, been arrived at. Good modelling is full of these planes subtly  fused together. Nothing is so characteristic of bad modelling as \"gross  roundnesses.\" The surface of a sphere is the surface with the least  character, like the curve of a circle, and the one most to be avoided in  good modelling.    In the search for form the knowledge of anatomy, and particularly the  bony structures, is of the utmost importance. During the rage for  realism and naturalism many hard things were said about the study of  anatomy. And certainly, were it to be used to overstep the modesty of  nature in these respects and to be paraded to the exclusion of the  charm and character of life, it would be as well left alone. But if we  are to make a drawing that shall express something concrete, we must  know something of its structure, whatever it is. In the case of the  human figure it is impossible properly to understand its action and draw  it in a way that shall give a powerful impression without a knowledge of  the mechanics of its construction. But I hardly think the case for  anatomy needs much stating at the present time. Never let anatomical  knowledge tempt you into exaggerated statements of internal structure,  unless such exaggeration helps the particular thing you wish to express.  In drawing a figure in violent action it might, for instance, be  essential to the drawing, whereas in drawing a figure at rest or a  portrait, it would certainly be out of place.

Blocking out the spaces occupied by different masses in  charcoal.]    [Illustration: Plate XXVII.    SET OF FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAME STUDY FROM THE LIFE IN DIFFERENT  STAGES    No. 2. A middle tone having been scumbled over the whole, the lights are  painted into it; variety being got by varying the thickness of the  paint.

The same as the last, but with the shadows added; variety being  got by varying thickness of paint as before.]    [Illustration: Plate XXIX.    SET OF FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAME STUDY FROM THE LIFE IN DIFFERENT  STAGES    No. 4. The completed head.]    In the chapter on line work it was stated that: \"Lines of shading drawn  across the forms suggest softness, lines drawn in curves fulness of  form, lines drawn down the forms hardness, and lines crossing in every  direction atmosphere,\" and these rules apply equally well to the  direction of the brush strokes (the brush work) in a painting.    #The brush swinging round the forms suggests fore-shortening, and  fulness of form generally, and across the forms softness, while the  brush following down the forms suggests toughness and hardness, and  crossing in every direction atmosphere#. A great deal of added force can  be given to form expression in this way. In the foreshortened figure on  the ground at the left of Tintoretto's \"Finding of the Body of St.  Mark,\" the foreshortened effect helped by the brush work swinging round  can be seen (see illustration, page 236 [Transcribers Note: Plate  XLIX]). The work of Henner in France is an extreme instance of the  quality of softness and fleshiness got by painting across the form. The  look of toughness and hardness given by the brush work following down  the forms is well illustrated in much of the work of James Ward, the  animal painter. In his picture in the National Gallery, \"Harlech  Castle,\" No. 1158, this can be seen in the painting of the tree-trunks,  &c.    The crossing of the brush work in every direction, giving a look of  atmosphere, is naturally often used in painting backgrounds and also  such things as the plane surfaces of sky and mist, &c.    It is often inconvenient to paint across the form when softness is  wanted. It is only possible to have one colour in your brush sweep, and  the colour changes across, much more than down the form as a rule. For  the shadows, half tones and lights, besides varying in tone, vary also  in colour; so that it is not always possible to sweep across them with  one colour. It is usually more convenient to paint down where the  colours can be laid in overlapping bands of shadow, half tone and light,  &c. Nevertheless, if this particular look of softness and fleshiness is  desired, either the painting must be so thin or the tones so fused  together that no brush strokes show, or a dry flat brush must afterwards  be drawn lightly across when the painting is done, to destroy the  downward brush strokes and substitute others going across, great care  being taken to drag only from light to dark, and to wipe the brush  carefully after each touch; and also never to go over the same place  twice, or the paint will lose vitality. This is a method much employed  by artists who delight in this particular quality.    But when a strong, tough look is desired, such as one sees when a  muscle is in violent action, or in the tendon above the wrist or above  the heel in the leg, or generally where a bone comes to the surface, in  all these cases the brush work should follow down the forms. It is not  necessary and is often inadvisable for the brush work to show at all, in  which case these principles will be of little account. But when in  vigorously painted work they do, I think it will generally be found to  create the effects named.    Drawing on toned paper with white chalk or Chinese white and black or  red chalk is another form of mass drawing. And for studies it is  intended to"]]]
