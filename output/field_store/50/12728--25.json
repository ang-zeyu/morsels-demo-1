In this he was safely conveyed to France, and  returned to the place of his former residence at St. Germain's. He had  no sooner quitted Dublin than it was also abandoned by all the papists.  The protestants immediately took possession of the arms belonging to  the militia, under the conduct of the bishops of Meath and Limerick.  A committee was formed to take charge of the administration; and an  account of these transactions was transmitted to king William, together  with a petition that he would honour the city with his presence.          WILLIAM ENTERS DUBLIN.    On the morning after the battle of the Boyne, William sent a detachment  of horse and foot, under the command of M. Mellionere, to Drogheda, the  governor of which surrendered the place without opposition. The king at  the head of the army began his march for Dublin, and halted the first  night at Bally-Breghan; where, having received advice of the enemy's  retreat from the capital, he sent the duke of Ormond with a body of  horse to take possession. These were immediately followed by the Dutch  guards, who secured the castle. In a few days the king encamped at  Finglas, in the neighbourhood of Dublin, where he was visited by the  bishops of Meath and Limerick, at the head of the protestant clergy,  whom he assured of his favour and protection. Then he published a  declaration of pardon to all the common people who had served against  him, provided they should return to their dwellings and surrender their  arms by the first day of August. Those that rented lands of popish  proprietors who had been concerned in the rebellion, were required to  retain their rents in their own hands until they should have notice  from the commissioners of the revenue to whom they should be paid. The  desperate leaders of the rebellion, who had violated the laws of the  kingdom, called in the French, authorized the depredations which had  been committed upon protestants, and rejected the pardon offered to them  on the king's first proclamation, were left to the event of war, unless  by evident demonstrations of repentance they should deserve mercy, which  would never be refused to those who were truly penitent. The next step  taken by king William was to issue a proclamation reducing the brass  money to nearly its intrinsic value. In the meantime, the principal  officers in the army of James, after having seen him embark at  Waterford, returned to their troops, determined to prosecute the war as  long as they could be supplied with means to support their operations.          VICTORY GAINED BY THE FRENCH.    During these transactions, the queen, as regent, found herself  surrounded with numberless cares and perplexities. Her council was  pretty equally divided into whigs and tories, who did not always act  with unanimity. She was distracted between her apprehensions for her  father's safety and her husband's life: she was threatened with an  invasion by the French from abroad, and with an insurrection by the  Jacobites at home. Nevertheless she disguised her fears, and behaved  with equal prudence and fortitude. Advice being received that a fleet  was ready to sail from Brest, lord Torrington hoisted his flag in the  Downs, and sailed round to St. Helen's, in order to assemble such a  number of ships as would enable him to give them battle. The enemy  being discovered off Plymouth on the twentieth day of June, the English  admiral, reinforced with a Dutch squadron, stood out to sea with a view  to intercept them at the back of the Isle of Wight, should they presume  to sail up the channel, not that he thought himself strong enough to  cope with them in battle. Their fleet consisted of seventy-eight ships  of war, and two-and-twenty fire-ships; whereas, the combined squadrons  of England and Holland did not exceed six-and-fifty; but he had received  orders to hazard an engagement if he thought it might be done with any  prospect of success. After the hostile fleets had continued five days  in sight of each other, lord Torrington bore down upon the enemy off  Beachy-head, on the thirtieth day of June, at day-break. The Dutch  squadron, which composed the van, began the engagement about nine in  the morning; in about half an hour the blue division of the English were  close engaged with the rear of the French; but the red, which formed  the centre, under the command of Torrington in person, did not fill the  line till ten o'clock, so that the Dutch were almost surrounded by the  enemy, and, though they fought with great valour, sustained considerable  damage. At length the admiral's division drove between them and the  French, and in that situation the fleet anchored about five in the  afternoon, when the action was interrupted by a calm. The Dutch had  suffered so severely, that Torrington thought it would be imprudent to  renew the battle; he therefore weighed anchor in the night, and with the  tide of flood retired to the eastward. The next day the disabled ships  were destroyed, that they might not be retarded in their retreat.  They were pursued as far as Rye; an English ship of seventy guns being  stranded near Winchelsea, was set on fire and deserted by the captain's  command. A Dutch ship of sixty-four guns met with the same accident, and  some French frigates attempted to burn her; but the captain defended her  so vigorously that they were obliged to desist, and he afterwards found  means to carry her safe to Holland. In this engagement the English lost  two ships, two sea-captains, and about four hundred men; but the Dutch  were more unfortunate: six of their great ships were destroyed. Dick  and Brackel, rear-admirals, were slain, together with a great number  of inferior officers and seamen. Torrington retreated without further  interruption into the mouth of the Thames; and, having taken precaution  against any attempts of the enemy in that quarter, returned to London,  the inhabitants of which were overwhelmed with consternation.          TORRINGTON COMMITTED TO THE TOWER.    The government was infected with the same panic. The ministry pretended  to believe that the French acted in concert with the malcontents of the  nation; that insurrections in the different parts of the kingdom had  been projected by the Jacobites; and that there would be a general  revolt in Scotland. These insinuations were circulated by the court  agents in order to justify, in the opinion of the public, the measures  that were deemed necessary at this juncture; and they produced the  desired effect. The apprehensions thus artfully raised among the people  inflamed their aversion to nonjurors and Jacobites. Addresses were  presented to the queen by the Cornish tinners, by the lieutenancy of  Middlesex, and by the mayor, aldermen, and lieutenancy of London, filled  with professions of loyalty and promises of supporting their majesties  as their lawful sovereigns, against all opposition. The queen at this  crisis exhibited remarkable proofs of courage, activity, and discretion.  She issued out proper orders and directions for putting the nation in a  posture of defence, as well as for refitting and augmenting the fleet;  she took measures for appeasing the resentment of the states-general,  who exclaimed against the earl of Torrington for his behaviour in the  late action. He was deprived of his command, and sent prisoner to  the Tower; and commissioners were appointed to examine the particular  circumstances of his conduct. A camp was formed in the neighbourhood  of Torbay, where the French seemed to threaten a descent. Their fleet,  which lay at anchor in the bay, cannonaded a small village called  Teign-mouth. About a thousand of their men landed without opposition,  set fire to the place, and burned a few coasting vessels; then they  re-embarked and returned to Brest, so vain of this achievement that they  printed a pompous account of their invasion. Some of the whig partizans  published pamphlets and diffused reports, implying that the suspended  bishops were concerned in the conspiracy against the government; and  these arts proved so inflammatory among the common people, that the  prelates thought it necessary to print a paper, in which they asserted  their innocence in the most solemn protestations. The court seems to  have harboured no suspicion against them, otherwise they would not have  escaped imprisonment. The queen issued a proclamation for apprehending  the earls of Litchfield, Aylesbury, and Castlemain; viscount Preston; the  lords Montgomery and Bellasis; sir Edward Hales, sir Robert Tharold, sir  Robert Hamilton, sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, colonel Edward Sackville,  and some other officers. These were accused of having conspired with  other disaffected persons to disturb and destroy the government, and of  a design to concur with her majesty's enemies in the intended invasion.  The earl of Torrington continued a prisoner in the Tower till next  session, when he was brought into the house of commons and made a speech  in his own defence. His case produced long debates in the upper house,  where the form of his commitment was judged illegal: at length he  was tried by a court-martial appointed by the commissioners of the  admiralty, though not before an act had passed, declaring the power of  a lord high-admiral vested in those commissioners. The president of the  court was sir Ralph Delavai, who had acted as vice-admiral of the blue  in the engagement. The earl was acquitted, but the king dismissed him  from the service; and the Dutch exclaimed against the partiality of his  judges.          PROGRESS OF WILLIAM IN IRELAND.    William is said to have intercepted all the papers of his father-in-law  and Tyrconnel, and to have learned from them not only the design  projected by the French to burn the English transports, but likewise the  undertaking of one Jones, who engaged to assassinate king William.

(#19)"],[1,"state: the amendment including  the advisers, as well as the officers, who had acted under the orders  of council in enforcing the embargo. But even this, which implied an  acknowledgment of error, was not sufficient to satisfy the public mind,  for the clamour still continued against the ministers. The Earl of  Chatham was also embarrassed by other circumstances, and in order to  strengthen his hands, he was compelled to forego his determination,  and to overlook his declaration, that he would never again have any  connexion with the old Duke of Newcastle. The duke had a party which  would be important to so weak a cabinet, and in order to gratify him,  Lord Edgecumbe was ungraciously dismissed from his office of treasurer  of the household, to make room for Sir John Shelley, a near relation  of his grace. But the remedy was as bad as the disease. Indignant at the  treatment which their colleague had received, Lord Resborough, the Duke  of Portland, the Earl of Scarborough, Lord Monson, Sir Charles Saunders,  first lord of the admiralty, Admiral Keppel, and Sir William Meredith,  all sent in their resignation, and they, with their adherents, ranged  themselves on the side of the opposition. These numerous secessions  compelled Chatham to negociate more explicitly, not only with  Newcastle's party, but with that also which was headed by the Duke of  Bedford. The place of first lord of the admiralty was offered to  Lord Gower, who took a journey to Woburn, for the express purpose of  consulting his grace upon the subject. But negociations with the Bedford  party concluded with its total alienation from the administration, nor  were those who accepted office thoroughly conciliated. These were Sir  Edward Hawke, who was made first lord of the admiralty, and Sir Percy  Brett and Mr. Jenkinson, who filled the other seats of the board; while  Lords Hillsborough and Le Despenser were appointed joint postmasters.  The ministry, as thus patched up, was more anomalous than ever, and  Chatham aware of this, and seeing that his popularity was daily more and  more declining, became a prey to grief, disappointment, and vexation.  At times he sank into the lowest state of despondency, and left his  incapable colleagues, to make their own arrangements and adopt their  own measures. But they could not act efficiently without him. Burke  says:--\"Having put so much the larger part of his enemies and opposers  into power, the confusion was such that his own principles could not  possibly have any effect, or influence, in the conduct of others. If  ever he fell into a fit of the gout, or if any other cause withdrew  him from public cares, principles directly the contrary were sure to  predominate. When he had executed his plan, he had not an inch of ground  to stand upon. When he had accomplished his scheme of administration,  he was no longer a minister. When his face was hid but for a moment, his  whole system was on a wide sea without chart or compass.\" Yet Chatham,  just before the recess, put a bold front upon his affairs in the house.  He proclaimed a war against party cabals, and asserted that his great  point was to destroy faction, and that he could face and dare the  greatest and proudest connexions. But this was an Herculean task which  neither Chatham nor any other minister has yet been able to accomplish.  Faction is an hydra-headed monster, which no man can destroy, either by  the charms of his eloquence or the terror of his countenance.    {A.D. 1767}    Chatham found that the warfare was an unequal one, and that he had not  sufficient strength to withstand the power of his enemies. Hence, at the  end of December, when all the appointments were made, he retired to his  estate of Burton Pynset, which had been recently left him, where he took  up his abode, doing nothing for the state, and yet taking the salary  attached to his office. Parliament reassembled after the recess without  him, his friends in the cabinet wondering at, and the king himself  lamenting, his absence. Yet the ministers attempted to work without him.  The chancellor of the exchequer proposed that the land-tax should be  continued at four shillings in the pound, stating that the proceeds of  such a tax would enable him to bring about the most brilliant operation  of finance recorded in the annals of Great Britain. This was a new  measure, for hitherto it had been the practice at the return of peace to  take off any addition that had been made to the land-tax in time of war.  Hence when Townshend proposed it in committee he was laughed at by the  country members, who contended for its reduction to three, or even  two, shillings in the pound. Townshend had nobody by him to second his  assertions, or give him powerful support; and when Mr. Grenville moved  that the land-tax should be reduced to three shillings, his motion  was carried by a majority of eighteen. It was said that the country  gentlemen in effecting this reduction, \"had bribed themselves with a  shilling in the pound of their own land-tax,\" but as this was the first  money-bill in which any cabinet had been successfully opposed since  the Revolution, it was rightly viewed as a symptom of weakness in the  administration: yet Townshend retained his office.    {GEORGE III. 1765-1769}          EAST INDIA QUESTION.    The great question discussed in parliament during this session related  to the East Indies. At this period the East India Company held \"the  gorgeous East in fee.\" The merchant princes of Leadenhall-street, who  commenced their career with a strip of sea-coast on the outermost limits  of Hindostan, had now acquired principalities and kingdoms, and had even  made themselves masters of the vast inheritance of Aurungzebe. Fortunate  as the Argonauts, they found and possessed themselves of the \"golden  fleece,\" which had been the object of their search. Enormous fortunes  were made with a rapidity hitherto unknown, and they were gathered into  the laps of even the most obscure adventurers. The fables of the ring  and the lamp were more than realised, and the fountain from whence these  riches ran appeared to flow from an inexhaustible source. Men had only  to go and stand by its brink, and if avarice could be satisfied, they  might soon return home with not only sufficient wealth to maintain  them in opulence and splendour, but with some to spare for the poor and  needy.    Such were the views which government seems to have taken of these  merchant princes. Early in November a committee was appointed for  investigating the nature of their charters, treaties, and grants, and  for calculating the expenses which had been incurred on their account  by government. In the course of this scrutiny two questions suggested  themselves to the committee; namely, whether the company had any right  to territorial acquisitions, and whether it was proper for them to enjoy  a monopoly of trade. Some of the members argued that the company had  a right, while on the other side some maintained that, from the costly  protection afforded it, government had an equitable claim to the  revenues of all territory acquired by conquest. It was the opinion of  the cabinet, that the state did not possess its proper share of the  company's profits, and the chancellor of the exchequer conceived that by  either taking their territorial conquests into the hands of government,  or making them pay largely for keeping that management in their ow a  hands, the state would obtain that wealth of which it stood so much  in need. Chatham's attention was drawn to this subject, but he merely  advised that Beckford should make a motion for examining into the state  of the East India Company, and remained still in the west of England.  This motion was made, and the house resolved itself into a committee of  inquiry, and called for papers. In the meantime the company suggested  an amicable arrangement, and presented a series of demands, among which  were--that the administration should prolong the charter to the year  1800, or to a further term, and to confirm to the company the sole and  exclusive trade of the East Indies for three years at least after the  expiration of the charter granted in the last reign; that it should  agree to an alteration in the inland duty upon tea, with the view of  preventing smuggling; that it should allow a drawback on the exportation  of tea; that it should alter the duties on calicoes and muslins; that  it should consent to some proper methods of recruiting the company's  military forces, and for strengthening their cause in India; that it  should prevent the commanders of the company's ships and others from  conveying any kind of warlike stores clandestinely to the East Indies;  that it should use its strong interposition with the court of France  to obtain large sums of money which the company had expended for the  maintenance and transport of French prisoners to Europe; and that it  should use its strong interposition likewise with the court of Spain  with respect to the Manilla ransom, that the company might obtain  indemnification for the great expenses incurred by that expedition. The  company laid before the house their charters, treaties with the native  sovereigns, letters and correspondence, and the state of their revenues  in Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa; but the whole affair was so complicated,  that the ministers could not make themselves thoroughly masters of  the subject. Not one would, in fact, undertake the management of the  business. They shifted the proposals from one to another, and could not  come to any determination what to accept or what to reject. At every  stage of the business it was attended with violent debates. Townshend  was strongly in favour of an amicable arrangement with the company,  laying great stress on the _quantum_ to be given for the prolongation of  the term of their charter, while Company declared that the salvation  of the country depended upon "]]]
