The man has perhaps recently moved to  this spot, and has not had time or energy to build himself a \"rancho,\"  and therefore the homestead consists of about four yards of canvas  stretched across the branch of a tree like the roof of a tent.    Beneath this is a \"New Home\" sewing machine, a Brummagem bedstead, and a  small trunk, made burglar-proof by innumerable bands and fastenings of  bright tin, or even gilt wall-paper. Scattered around are the little  Fulanos, in costumes varying from nothing to very little.    Their mother ceases her cooking operations, wipes her hands on the  nearest child's head, and invites the visitor to dismount.    He answers that he is looking for her husband, and she directs him with  a sweep of the hand which covers a quadrant of the compass and includes  several square leagues of thick forest. Taking a likely track, however,  he soon hears the ring of axe-strokes, and finds his man patiently  chipping away at a felled tree, which is rapidly taking the form of a  baulk, with the sides as smooth as if sawn.    His horse is tied up near, and he takes the Mayor-domo through his  \"corte,\" showing him the wood prepared for the carters. Give him a  chance and he will count every log twice (most likely he has already  plastered mud over the marks which show the rotten patch in the wood,  and is wondering whether he has cleared the black sufficiently off a  piece of \"campana\" to persuade a reasonable man that it is really fresh  wood).    It is part of the inspector's stock in trade to know these and a myriad  other tricks, too numerous to take separately.    The typical axeman in the Santa Fe Chaco is more genuinely \"childlike\"  than, and quite as \"bland\" as, the famous Celestial. He never quite  grows up; he will spend his last dollar on a mouth-organ when he is  forty, and give a wild war-whoop of delight as a stack of newly piled  sleepers falls crashing to the ground.    He loves sweets and the bright clothes which he wears with childish  dignity on feast-days and holidays.    His _amour propre_ is tremendous, and influences his code of honour to a  great extent. The first ten commandments he will break most cheerfully,  but the eleventh--\"Thou shalt not be found out\"--he respects to the best  of his power.    Stealing, for instance, he regards as a pastime, but call him a thief  and you must be prepared for trouble. A perfect instance of this can be  quoted in the case of an estanciero who found a peon wearing one of his  shirts.    [Illustration: _Square Quebracho Logs worked by the Axeman, showing  Resin oozing therefrom._]    \"You are wearing my shirt,\" said the master. \"No, Senor; I bought it in  the store.\" \"But you stole it from me,\" insisted the estanciero,  pointing to the tab at the front, where his name was written in marking  ink; \"there is my name on it.\"    The man, being quite illiterate, had not reckoned on such damning  evidence, but he recovered himself and replied with dignity: \"Very well,  Senor; if it is yours, take it; _but don't call me a thief_.\"    Honesty is with them, admittedly, a matter of degree. A man will always  say if questioned about some small deficiency, \"Do you think I would  swindle you for a matter of two dollars?\" or \"Do you think I would risk  my credit with the Company for the sake of _one_ calf?\" To be honest in  a case where a larger profit is involved is a height of integrity to  which he does not even pretend. \"I am going to be frank with you\"--that  is an expression which puts the wise man on his guard, for it is  generally followed by a cascade of lies.    Business must be done on a completely different basis to that which  obtains in England. To return to our friend Fulano, for instance: he  wishes perhaps to ask for an increase of fifty cents per ton on his  wood, and introduces the subject by a short conversation about the  points of his horse, passing on to the bad state of the bullocks and  enlarging on the chance of a rainy winter. You have just decided that he  has nothing more to say and are preparing to leave him, when he makes  his request with as much circumlocution as possible. To have come  straight to the point would have been contrary to all his ideas of  correct procedure.    I have heard two natives make one another's acquaintance with a bout of  verbal sparring which an Englishman would obviate by a single sentence,  such as \"Good morning; Mr. Brown, I believe?\" \"Yes,\" the other would  answer, and the business would be entered upon immediately.    The Spanish blood, however, calls for some such dialogue as the  following, which is taken from real life.    _A._--\"Good day.\"    _B._--\"Good day.\"    _A._--\"How are you, Senor?\"    _B._--\"Very well, thank you, Senor; how are you?\"    _A._--\"Very well, thank you.\"    _B._--\"I am glad.\"    _A._--\"Equally.\"    _B._--\"Don't mention it.\"    _A._--\"I am speaking to Mr. Juan Sosa?\"    _B._--\"At your service.\"    _A._--\"At yours.\"    _B._--\"Equally.\"    _A._--\"It gives me great pleasure to know you.\"    _B._--\"Equally.\"    They are flowery always, whether in greeting, praise, commendation, or  in denunciation.    In illustration of the last point, I once heard a cartman give vent to a  quite Olympic challenge.    His cart had stuck in a deep rut up to the axles, and he commenced  operations by addressing his bullocks with tender words and soft names  swiftly followed by lurid curses. This proving useless, he invoked  higher powers, and called on his pet saints by name--\"Help me, San  Pedro, San Geronimo, Santa Lucia, San Juan.\" Still no result:--    Then his patience failed entirely--\"If you won't help me, San Pedro,\" he  shouted, \"come down and I'll fight you;\" \"Come down, San Juan, and I'll  take you both on together.\"    Still no reply.    Taking his hat off he placed it on the ground, made the motion of  clawing his guardians from the skies and placing them in his hat.    \"Stay there, San Geronimo; Stay there, San Juan; Stay there, San Marco.\"    When his hat was full enough for his satisfaction he leapt into the air,  came down on it with both feet, and continued to dance on it for about  three minutes.    Thus, for a real or imagined slight, the streak of black blood will show  up and convert a friend into a relentless enemy.    It is not surprising when one considers the lack of civilising  influences which ought to be exerted from the top downwards, but which  have no root in the highest power they know, which is the arm of the  law. It might be interesting to note a few proofs of the corruption  which exists among those who wield the local weapons of justice--among  the commissaries, police, and justices of the peace.    The Chief of Police of----, for instance, a town of only about 7,000  inhabitants, refused L2,000 a year for the local gambling rights.    Again, a gardener, whom I knew, was put in jail for being drunk and  disorderly. On going to the place some time later I found the man still  imprisoned. \"Why,\" I asked, \"for such a small offence\"? \"We found,\" was  the answer, \"that when sober he was such a good workman that we could  not spare him from the job of cleaning the stables.\"    On the other hand, a friend of mine was dissatisfied with the policeman  he had, and sent the sergeant into the township to exchange him for  another. The man returned with a particularly villainous-looking  specimen, and when asked where he had got him, explained that the Chief  of Police had told him to look among the prisoners for a suitable man,  give him a uniform and take him.    \"I thought this was the best of them; but they all wanted to come,\" he  concluded ingenuously.    Another commissary in the north of this country flattered himself on his  revolver-shooting, and used to perform the feat of shooting the hat off  a man's head without hurting him. He was in the local bar one day when a  peon entered with a brand new white hat; it was an opportunity not to be  missed. Crack--and the man fell with a bullet through his temple instead  of his hat.    Did the Comisario stand stricken with remorse, or burst into  self-reproach? No. He moved the body with the toe of his boot and  remarked: \"Carramba, I am getting a very poor shot nowadays.\"    A story which was told me in the province of Rio Negro, and which was  well vouched for, contained serio-comic elements of which I believe the  perpetrator, whom I knew personally, quite capable.    An old man who owned a considerable quantity of land, died intestate. A  man who lived with him, Garcia by name, had no idea of letting the  property go to distant unknown relations, and concocted the following  plot (obviously with the connivance of the neighbouring Justice of the  Peace, who was a friend of his).    The law allows that a sane man \"in articulo mortis,\" and past the power  of speech, may make statements by signs: so when the Justice was  summoned to the house, Garcia told him that the man was not yet dead,  and wished to make his will.    Garcia seated himself at the foot of the bed, while the Justice at the  side addressed questions to the deceased on the following lines:--    \"Do you wish me to record your last will and testament?\"    The corpse nodded.    \"Do you wish your property to pass into your cousins' hands?\"    The head moved from side to side.    \"Do you intend to make Garcia your sole legatee?\"    The deceased nodded several times.    Two witnesses were brought, and the business was settled with  commendable promptitude.    I think it was Garcia himself who explained, some time afterwards, that  as the dead man wore a full beard and whiskers, it was easy enough to  hide the strings passing from his ears and chin to the foot of the bed  under the coverings.    In this connection I have since heard that one of the legal ceremonies  in a coroner's inquest in Central America is to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#19)"],[1,"of the law, for the older  they grow the more thoughtful they become, and the wiser, as it is said  (Job xii. 12), \"With the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days  understanding.\"    _Kinnin_, chap. 3.    The salutation of the ignorant should be responded to quietly, and with  a reluctant nod of the head.    _Taanith_, fol. 14, col. 2.    No calamities ever befall the world except such as are brought on by the  ignorant.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 8, col. 1.    Rav Hunna's widow once appeared before Rav Nachman as plaintiff in a  lawsuit. \"What shall I do?\" he said. \"If I rise before her (to honor her  as the widow of a Rabbi), the defendant, who is an _amhaaretz_, will  feel uneasy; and if I don't rise I shall break the rule which ordains  that the wife of an associate is to be treated as an associate.\" So he  said to his servant, \"Loose a young goose over my head, then I'll get  up.\"    Rav bar Sheravyah had a lawsuit with an _amhaaretz_ before Rav Pappa,  who bade him be seated, and also asked the other to sit down. When the  officer of the court raised the _amhaaretz_ with a kick, the magistrate  did not request him to be seated again.    _Shevuoth_, fol. 30, col. 2.    Six things are said respecting demons. In three particulars they are  like angels, and in three they resemble men. They have wings like  angels; like angels they fly from one end of the world to the other, and  they know the future, as angels do, with this difference, that they  learn by listening behind the veil what angels have revealed to them  within. In three respects they resemble men. They eat and drink like  men, they beget and increase like men, and like men they die.    _Chaggigah_, fol. 16, col. 1.        The Talmud is particularly rich in demonology, and many are the      forms which the evil principle assumes in its pages. We have no      wish to drag these shapes to the light, and interrogate them as      to the part they play in this intricate life. Enough now if we      mention the circumstance of their existence, and introduce to      the reader the story of Ashmedai, the king of the demons. The      story is worth relating, both for its own sake and its      historical significance.        In Ecclesiastes ii. 8, we read, \"I gat me men singers and women      singers, the delights of the sons of men, as musical      instruments, and that of all sorts.\" These last seven words      represent only two in the original Hebrew, _Shiddah-veshiddoth_.      These two words in the original Hebrew translated by the last      seven in this verse, have been a source of great perplexity to      the critics, and their exact meaning is matter of debate to this      hour. They in the West say they mean severally carriages for      lords and carriages for ladies, while we, says the Babylonish      Talmud, interpret them to signify male demons and female demons.      Whereupon, if this last is the correct rendering, the question      arises, for what purpose Solomon required them? The answer is to      be found in 1 Kings vi. 7, where it is written, \"And the house,      when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it      was brought thither,\" etc. For before the operation commenced      Solomon asked the Rabbis, \"How shall I accomplish this without      using tools of iron?\" and they remembering of an insect which      had existed since the creation of the world, whose powers were      such as the hardest substances could not resist, replied, \"There      is the Shameer, with which Moses cut the precious stones of the      Ephod.\" Solomon asked, \"And where, pray, is the Shameer to be      found?\" To which they made answer, \"Let a male demon and a      female come, and do thou coerce them both; mayhap they know and      will reveal it to thee.\" He then conjured into his presence a      male and a female demon, and proceeded to torture them, but in      vain, for said they, \"We know not its whereabouts and cannot      tell; perhaps Ashmedai, the king of the demons, knows.\" On being      further interrogated as to where he in turn might be found, they      made this answer: \"In yonder mount is his residence; there he      has dug a pit, and, after filling it with water, covered it over      with a stone, and sealed with his own seal. Daily he ascends to      heaven and studies in the school of wisdom there, then he comes      down and studies in the school of wisdom here; upon which he      goes and examines the seal, then opens the pit, and after      quenching his thirst, covers it up again, re-seals it, and takes      his departure.\"        Solomon thereupon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, provided      with a magic chain and ring, upon both of which the name of God      was engraved. He also provided him with a fleece of wool and      sundry skins with wine. Then Benaiah went and sank a pit below      that of Ashmedai, into which he drained off the water and      plugged the duct between with the fleece. Then he set to and dug      another hole higher up with a channel leading into the emptied      pit of Ashmedia, by means of which the pit was filled with the      wine he had brought. After leveling the ground so as not to      rouse suspicion, he withdrew to a tree close by, so as to watch      the result and wait his opportunity. After a while Ashmedai      came, and examined the seal, when, seeing it all right, he      raised the stone, and to his surprise found wine in the pit. For      a time he stood muttering and saying, it is written, \"Wine is a      mocker: strong drink is raging, and whosoever is deceived      thereby is not wise.\" And again, \"Whoredom and wine and new wine      take away the heart.\" Therefore at first he was unwilling to      drink, but being thirsty, he could not long resist the      temptation. He proceeded to drink therefore, when, becoming      intoxicated, he lay down to sleep. Then Benaiah, came forth from      his ambush, and stealthily approaching, fastened the chain round      the sleeper's neck. Ashmedai, when he awoke, began to fret and      fume, and would have torn off the chain that bound him, had not      Benaiah warned him, saying, \"The name of thy Lord is upon thee.\"      Having thus secured him, Benaiah proceeded to lead him away to      his sovereign master. As they journeyed along they came to a      palm-tree, against which Ashmedai rubbed himself, until he      uprooted it and threw it down. When they drew near to a hut, the      poor widow who inhabited it came out and entreated him not to      rub himself against it, upon which, as he suddenly bent himself      back, he snapt a bone of his body, and said, \"This is that which      is written (Prov. xxv. 15), 'And a gentle answer breaketh the      bone.'\" Descrying a blind man straying out of his way, he hailed      him and directed him aright. He even did the same service to a      man overcome with wine, who was in a similar predicament. At      sight of a wedding party that passed rejoicing along, he wept;      but he burst into uncontrollable laughter when he heard a man      order at a shoemaker's stall a pair of shoes that would last      seven years; and when he saw a magician at his work he broke      forth into shrieks of scorn.        On arriving at the royal city, three days were allowed to pass      before he was introduced to Solomon. On the first day he said.      \"Why does the king not invite me into his presence?\" \"He has      drunk too much,\" was the answer, \"and the wine has overpowered      him.\" Upon which he lifted a brick and placed it upon the top of      another. When this was communicated to Solomon, he replied \"He      meant by this, go and make him drunk again.\" On the day      following he asked again, \"Why does the king not invite me into      his presence?\" They replied, \"He has eaten too much.\" On this he      removed the brick again from the top of the other. When this was      reported to the king, he interpreted it to mean, \"Stint him in      his food.\"        After the third day, he was introduced to the king; when      measuring off four cubits upon the floor with the stick he held      in his hand, he said to Solomon, \"When thou diest, thou wilt not      possess in this world (he referred to the grave) more than four      cubits of earth. Meanwhile thou has conquered the world, yet      thou wert not satisfied until thou hadst overcome me also.\" To      this the king quietly replied, \"I want nothing of thee, but I      wish to build the Temple and have need of the _Shameer_.\" To      which Ashmedai at once answered, \"The Shameer is not committed      in charge to me, but to the Prince of the Sea, and he intrusts      it to no one except to the great wild cock, and that upon an      oath that he return it to him again.\" Whereupon Solomon asked,      \"And what does the wild cock do with the Shameer?\" To which the      demon replied, \"He takes it to a barren rocky mountain, and by      means of it he cleaves the mountain asunder, into the cleft of      which, formed into a valley, he drops the seeds of various      plants and trees, and thus the place becomes clothed with      verdure and fit for habitation.\" This is the _Shameer_ (Lev. xi.      19), Nagger Tura, which the Targum renders Mountain Splitter.        They therefore searched for the nest of the wild cock, which      they found contained a young brood. This they covered with a      glass, that the bird might see its young, but not be able to get      at them. When accordingly the bird came and found his nest      impenetrably glazed over, he went and fetched the Shameer. Just      as he was about to apply it to the glass in order to cut it,      Solomon's messenger gave a startling shout, and this so agitated      the bird that he dropped the Shameer, and Solomon's messenger      caught it up and made off with it. The cock thereupon went and      strangled himself, because he was unable to keep the oath by      which he had"]]]
