But if we state it as above (chap. vi. Sec. 3), that whatever is  true in one form of words is true in any other, there is no difficulty  in applying it to Conversion.    Thus, to take the simple conversion of I.,        _Some S is P; .'. Some P is S._      _Some poets are business-like; .'. Some business-like men are poets._    Here the convertend and the converse say the same thing, and this is  true if that is.    We have, then, two cases of simple conversion: of I. (as above) and of  E. For E.:        _No S is P; .'. No P is S._      _No ruminants are carnivores; .'. No carnivores are ruminants._    In converting I., the predicate (P) when taken as the new subject, being  preindesignate, is treated as particular; and in converting E., the  predicate (P), when taken as the new subject, is treated as universal,  according to the rule in chap. v. Sec. 1.    A. is the one case of conversion by limitation:        All S is P;      .'. Some P is S.        All cats are grey in the dark;      .'. Some things grey in the dark are cats.    The predicate is treated as particular, when taking it for the new  subject, according to the rule not to go beyond the evidence. To infer  that _All things grey in the dark are cats_ would be palpably absurd;  yet no error of reasoning is commoner than the simple conversion of A.  The validity of conversion by limitation may be shown thus: if, _All S  is P_, then, by subalternation, _Some S is P_, and therefore, by simple  conversion, _Some P is S_.    O. cannot be truly converted. If we take the proposition: _Some S is  not P_, to convert this into _No P is S_, or _Some P is not S_, would  break the rule in chap. vi. Sec. 6; since _S,_ undistributed in the  convertend, would be distributed in the converse. If we are told that  _Some men are not cooks_, we cannot infer that _Some cooks are not men_.  This would be to assume that '_Some men_' are identical with '_All  men_.'    By quantifying the predicate, indeed, we may convert O. simply, thus:        _Some men are not cooks_ .'. _No cooks are some men._    And the same plan has some advantage in converting A.; for by the usual  method _per accidens_, the converse of A. being I., if we convert this  again it is still I., and therefore means less than our original  convertend. Thus:        _All S is P .'. Some P is S .'. Some S is P._    Such knowledge, as that _All S_ (the whole of it) _is P_, is too  precious a thing to be squandered in pure Logic; and it may be preserved  by quantifying the predicate; for if we convert A. to Y., thus--        _All S is P .'. Some P is all S--_    we may reconvert Y. to A. without any loss of meaning. It is the chief  use of quantifying the predicate that, thereby, every proposition is  capable of simple conversion.    The conversion of propositions in which the relation of terms is  inadequately expressed (see chap. ii., Sec. 2) by the ordinary copula (_is_  or _is not_) needs a special rule. To argue thus--        _A is followed by B_ .'. _Something followed by B is A_--    would be clumsy formalism. We usually say, and we ought to say--        _A is followed by B_ .'. _B follows A_ (or _is preceded by A_).    Now, any relation between two terms may be viewed from either side--_A:  B_ or _B: A_. It is in both cases the same fact; but, with the altered  point of view, it may present a different character. For example, in the  Immediate Inference--_A > B_ .'. _B < A_--a diminishing turns into an  increasing ratio, whilst the fact predicated remains the same. Given,  then, a relation between two terms as viewed from one to the other, the  same relation viewed from the other to the one may be called the  Reciprocal. In the cases of Equality, Co-existence and Simultaneity, the  given relation and its reciprocal are not only the same fact, but they  also have the same character: in the cases of Greater and Less and  Sequence, the character alters.    We may, then, state the following rule for the conversion of  propositions in which the whole relation explicitly stated is taken as  the copula: Transpose the terms, and for the given relation substitute  its reciprocal. Thus--        _A is the cause of B .'. B is the effect of A._    The rule assumes that the reciprocal of a given relation is definitely  known; and so far as this is true it may be extended to more concrete  relations--        _A is a genus of B .'. B is a species of A      A is the father of B .'. B is a child of A._    But not every relational expression has only one definite reciprocal. If  we are told that _A is the brother of B_, we can only infer that _B is  either the brother or the sister of A_. A list of all reciprocal  relations is a desideratum of Logic.    Sec. 5. Obversion (otherwise called Permutation or AEquipollence) is  Immediate Inference by changing the quality of the given proposition and  substituting for its predicate the contradictory term. The given  proposition is called the 'obvertend,' and the inference from it the  'obverse.' Thus the obvertend being--_Some philosophers are consistent  reasoners_, the obverse will be--_Some philosophers are not inconsistent  reasoners_.    The legitimacy of this mode of reasoning follows, in the case of  affirmative propositions, from the principle of Contradiction, that if  any term be affirmed of a subject, the contradictory term may be denied  (chap. vi. Sec. 3). To obvert affirmative propositions, then, the rule  is--Insert the negative sign, and for the predicate substitute its  contradictory term.        A. _All S is P .'. No S is not-P         All men are fallible .'. No men are infallible._        I. _Some S is P .'. some S is not-P         Some philosophers are consistent .'. Some philosophers are not           inconsistent._    In agreement with this mode of inference, we have the rule of modern  English grammar, that 'two negatives make an affirmative.'    Again, by the principle of Excluded Middle, if any term be denied of a  subject, its contradictory may be affirmed: to obvert negative  propositions, then, the rule is--Remove the negative sign, and for the  predicate substitute its contradictory term.        E. _No S is P .'. All S is not-P         No matter is destructible .'. All matter is indestructible._        O. _Some S is not P .'. Some S is not-P         Some ideals are not attainable .'. Some ideals are unattainable._    Thus, by obversion, each of the four propositions retains its quantity  but changes its quality: A. to E., I. to O., E. to A., O. to I. And all  the obverses are infinite propositions, the affirmative infinites having  the sense of negatives, and the negative infinites having the sense of  affirmatives.    Again, having obtained the obverse of a given proposition, it may be  desirable to recover the obvertend; or it may at any time be requisite  to change a given infinite proposition into the corresponding direct  affirmative or negative; and in such cases the process is still  obversion. Thus, if _No S is not-P_ be given us to recover the obvertend  or to find the corresponding affirmative; the proposition being formally  negative, we apply the rule for obverting negatives: 'Remove the  negative sign, and for the predicate substitute its contradictory.' This  yields the affirmative _All S is P_. Similarly, to obtain the obvertend  of _All S is not-P_, apply the rule for obverting Affirmatives; and this  yields _No S is P_.    Sec. 6. Contrariety.--We have seen in chap. iv. Sec. 8, that contrary terms  are such that no two of them are predicable in the same way of the same  subject, whilst perhaps neither may be predicable of it. Similarly,  Contrary Propositions may be defined as those of which no two are ever  both true together, whilst perhaps neither may be true; or, in other  words, both may be false. This is the relation between A. and E. when  concerned with the same matter: as A.--_All men are wise_; E.--_No men  are wise_. Such propositions cannot both be true; but they may both be  false, for some men may be wise and some not. They cannot both be true;  for, by the principle of Contradiction, if _wise_ may be affirmed of  _All men, not-wise_ must be denied; but _All men are not-wise_ is the  obverse of _No men are wise_, which therefore may also be denied.    At the same time we cannot apply to A. and E. the principle of Excluded  Middle, so as to show that one of them must be true of the same matter.  For if we deny that _All men are wise_, we do not necessarily deny the  attribute 'wise' of each and every man: to say that _Not all are wise_  may mean no more than that _Some are not_. This gives a proposition in  the form of O.; which, as we have seen, does not imply its subalternans,  E.    If, however, two Singular Propositions, having the same matter, but  differing in quality, are to be treated as universals, and therefore as  A. and E., they are, nevertheless, contradictory and not merely  contrary; for one of them must be false and the other true.    Sec. 7. Contradiction is a relation between two propositions analogous to  that between contradictory terms (one of which being affirmed of a  subject the other is denied)--such, namely, that one of them is false  and the other true. This is the case with the forms A. and O., and E.  and I., in the same matter. If it be true that _All men are wise_, it is  false that _Some men are not wise_ (equivalent by obversion to _Some  men are not-wise_); or else, since the 'Some men' are included in the  'All men,' we should be predicating of the same men that they are both  'wise' and 'not-wise'; which would violate the principle of  Contradiction. Similarly, _No men are wise_, being by obversion  equivalent to _All men are not-wise_, is incompatible with _Some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#19)"],[1," hear of Thee;      No music like Thy charming name,        Nor half so sweet can be.    The composer of the bright legato melody just described was Frederick  Burgmueller, a young German musician, born in 1804. He was a remarkable  genius, both in composition and execution, but his health was frail, and  he did not live to fulfil the rich possibilities that lay within him. He  died in 1824--only twenty years old. The tune \"Rhine\" (\"Emmons\") is from  one of his marches.      \"WHILE THEE I SEEK, PROTECTING POWER.\"    Helen Maria Williams wrote this sweet hymn, probably about the year  1800. She was a brilliant woman, better known in literary society for  her political verses and essays than by her hymns; but the hymn here  noted bears sufficient witness to her deep religious feeling:        While Thee I seek, Protecting Power,        Be my vain wishes stilled,      And may this consecrated hour        With better hopes be filled.      Thy love the power of thought bestowed;        To Thee my thoughts would soar,      Thy mercy o'er my life has flowed,        That mercy I adore.    Miss Williams was born in the north of England, Nov. 30, 1762, but spent  much of her life in London, and in Paris, where she died, Dec. 14, 1827.      _THE TUNE._    Wedded so many years to the gentle, flowing music of Pleyel's \"Brattle  Street,\" few lovers of the hymn recall its words without the melody of  that emotional choral.    The plain psalm-tune, \"Simpson,\" by Louis Spohr, divides the stanzas  into quatrains.      \"JESUS MY ALL TO HEAVEN IS GONE.\"    This hymn, by Cennick, was familiarized to the public more than two  generations ago by its revival tune, sometimes called \"Duane Street,\"  long-metre double. It is staffed in various keys, but its movement is  full of life and emphasis, and its melody is contagious. The piece was  composed by Rev. George Coles, in 1835.    The fact that this hymn of Cennick with Coles's tune appears in the _New  Methodist Hymnal_ indicates the survival of both in modern favor.    [Illustration: Augustus Montague Toplady]        Jesus my all to heaven is gone,      He whom I fixed my hopes upon;      His track I see, and I'll pursue      The narrow way till Him I view.      The way the holy prophets went,      The road that leads from banishment,      The King's highway of holiness      I'll go for all Thy paths are peace.    The memory has not passed away of the hearty unison with which  prayer-meeting and camp-meeting assemblies used to \"crescendo\" the last  stanza--        Then will I tell to sinners round      What a dear Saviour I have found;      I'll point to His redeeming blood,      And say \"Behold the way to God.\"    The Rev. George Coles was born in Stewkley, Eng., Jan. 2, 1792, and died  in New York City, May 1, 1858. He was editor of the _N.Y. Christian  Advocate_, and _Sunday School Advocate_, for several years, and was a  musician of some ability, besides being a good singer.      \"SWEET THE MOMENTS, RICH IN BLESSING.\"    The Hon. and Rev. Walter Shirley, Rector of Loughgree, county of Galway,  Ireland, revised this hymn under the chastening discipline of a most  trying experience. His brother, the Earl of Ferrars, a licentious man,  murdered an old and faithful servant in a fit of rage, and was executed  at Tyburn for the crime. Sir Walter, after the disgrace and long  distress of the imprisonment, trial, and final tragedy, returned to his  little parish in Ireland, humbled but driven nearer to the Cross.        Sweet the moments, rich in blessing        Which before the Cross I spend;      Life and health and peace possessing        From the sinner's dying Friend.    All the emotion of one who buries a mortifying sorrow in the heart of  Christ, and tries to forget, trembles in the lines of the above hymn as  he changed and adapted it in his saddest but devoutest hours. Its  original writer was the Rev. James Allen, nearly twenty years younger  than himself, a man of culture and piety, but a Christian of shifting  creeds. It is not impossible that he sent his hymn to Shirley to revise.  At all events it owes its present form to Shirley's hand.        Truly blessed is the station        Low before His cross to lie,      While I see Divine Compassion        Beaming in His gracious eye.[11]    [Footnote 11: \"Floating in His languid eye\" seems to have been the  earlier version.]    The influence of Sir Walter's family misfortune is evident also in the  mood out of which breathed his other trustful lines--        Peace, troubled soul, whose plaintive moan      Hath taught these rocks the notes of woe,    (changed now to \"hath taught _these scenes_\" etc).    Sir Walter Shirley, cousin of the Countess of Huntingdon, was born 1725,  and died in 1786. Even in his last sickness he continued to preach to  his people in his house, seated in his chair.    Rev. James Oswald Allen was born at Gayle, Yorkshire, Eng., June 24,  1743. He left the University of Cambridge after a year's study, and  became an itinerant preacher, but seems to have been a man of unstable  religious views. After roving from one Christian denomination to another  several times, he built a Chapel, and for forty years ministered there  to a small Independent congregation. He died in Gayle, Oct. 31, 1804.    The tune long and happily associated with \"Sweet the Moments\" is  \"Sicily,\" or the \"Sicilian Hymn\"--from an old Latin hymn-tune, \"O  Sanctissima.\"      \"O FOR A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD.\"    The author, William Cowper, son of a clergyman, was born at  Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, Eng., Nov. 15, 1731, and died at Dereham,  Norfolk, April 25, 1800. Through much of his adult life he was afflicted  with a mental ailment inducing melancholia and at times partial  insanity, during which he once attempted suicide. He sought literary  occupation as an antidote to his disorder of mind, and besides a great  number of lighter pieces which diverted him and his friends, composed  \"The Task,\" an able and delightful moral and domestic poetic treatise in  blank verse, and in the same style of verse translated Homer's _Odyssey_  and _Iliad_.    One of the most beloved of English poets, this suffering man was also a  true Christian, and wrote some of our sweetest and most spiritual hymns.  Most of these were composed at Olney, where he resided for a time with  John Newton, his fellow hymnist, and jointly with him issued the volume  known as the _Olney Hymns_.      _THE TUNE._    Music more or less closely identified with this familiar hymn is  Gardiner's \"Dedham,\" and also \"Mear,\" often attributed to Aaron  Williams. Both, about equally with the hymn, are seasoned by time, but  have not worn out their harmony--or their fitness to Cowper's prayer.    William Gardiner was born in Leicester, Eng., March 15, 1770, and died  there Nov. 11, 1853. He was a vocal composer and a \"musicographer\" or  writer on musical subjects.    One Aaron Williams, to whom \"Mear\" has by some been credited, was of  Welsh descent, a composer of psalmody and clerk of the Scotch church in  London. He was born in 1734, and died in 1776. Another account, and the  more probable one, names a minister of Boston of still earlier date as  the author of the noble old harmony. It is found in a small New England  collection of 1726, but not in any English or Scotch collection. \"Mear\"  is presumably an American tune.      \"WHAT VARIOUS HINDRANCES WE MEET.\"    Another hymn of Cowper's; and no one ever suffered more deeply the  plaintive regret in the opening lines, or better wrought into poetic  expression an argument for prayer.        What various hindrances we meet      In coming to a mercy-seat!      Yet who that knows the worth of prayer      But wishes to be often there?        Prayer makes the darkest clouds withdraw,      Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw.    The whole hymn is (or once was) so thoroughly learned by heart as to be  fixed in the church among its household words. Preachers to the  diffident do not forget to quote--        Have you no words? ah, think again;      Words flow apace when you _complain_.           *       *       *       *       *        Were half the breath thus vainly spent      To Heaven in supplication sent,      Our cheerful song would oftener be,      \"Hear what the Lord hath done for me!\"    And there is all the lifetime of a proverb in the couplet--        Satan trembles when he sees      The weakest saint upon his knees.    Tune, Lowell Mason's \"Rockingham.\"      \"MY GRACIOUS REDEEMER I LOVE.\"    This is one of Benjamin Francis's lays of devotion. The Christian  Welshman who bore that name was a Gospel minister full of Evangelical  zeal, who preached in many places, though his pastoral home was with the  Baptist church in Shortwood, Wales. Flattering calls to London could not  tempt him away from his first and only parish, and he remained there  till his triumphant death. He was born in 1734, and died in 1799.        My gracious Redeemer I love,        His praises aloud I'll proclaim,      And join with the armies above,        To shout His adorable name.      To gaze on His glories divine        Shall be my eternal employ;      To see them incessantly shine,        My boundless, ineffable joy.    Tune, \"Birmingham\"--an English melody. Anonymous.      \"BLEST BE THE TIE THAT BINDS.\"    Perhaps the best hymn-expression of sacred brotherhood, at least it has  had, and still has the indorsement of constant use. The author, John  Fawcett, D.D., is always quoted as the example of his own words, since  he sacrificed ambition and personal interest to Christian affection.    Born near Bradford, Yorkshire, Jan. 6, 1739, and converted under the  preaching of Whitefield, he joined the Methodists, but afterwards  became a member of the new Baptist church in Bradford. Seven years later  he was ordained over the Baptist Society at Wainsgate. In 1772 he  received a call to succeed the celebrated Dr. Gill, in London, and  accepted. But at the last"]]]
