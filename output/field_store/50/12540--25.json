I will restore thee to thy dominion, and thou  shalt sit upon the throne of thy seducer, while he shall be  damned, with those who hearken unto him.\"[134]    Thereupon, at the bidding of God, the three great archangels[135]  covered the body of Adam with linen, and poured sweet-smelling  oil upon it. With it they interred also the body of Abel, which  had lain unburied since Cain had slain him, for all the  murderer's efforts to hide it had been in vain. The corpse again  and again sprang forth from the earth, and a voice issued thence,  proclaiming, \"No creature shall rest in the earth until the first  one of all has returned the dust to me of which it was  formed.\"[136] The angels carried the two bodies to Paradise,  Adam's and Abel's--the latter had all this time been lying on a  stone on which angels had placed it--and they buried them both on  the spot whence God had taken the dust wherewith to make  Adam.[137]    God called unto the body of Adam, \"Adam! Adam!\" and it answered,  \"Lord, here am I!\" Then God said: \"I told thee once, Dust thou  art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Now I promise thee  resurrection. I will awaken thee on the day of judgment, when all  the generations of men that spring from thy loins, shall arise  from the grave.\" God then sealed up the grave, that none might do  him harm during the six days to elapse until his rib should be  restored to him through the death of Eve.[138]      THE DEATH OF EVE    The interval between Adam's death and her own Eve spent in  weeping. She was distressed in particular that she knew not what  had become of Adam's body, for none except Seth had been awake  while the angel interred it. When the hour of her death drew  nigh, Eve supplicated to be buried in the selfsame spot in which  the remains of her husband rested. She prayed to God: \"Lord of  all powers! Remove not Thy maid-servant from the body of Adam,  from which Thou didst take me, from whose limbs Thou didst form  me. Permit me, who am an unworthy and sinning woman, to enter  into his habitation. As we were together in Paradise, neither  separated from the other; as together we were tempted to  transgress Thy law, neither separated from the other, so, O Lord,  separate us not now.\" To the end of her prayer she added the  petition, raising her eyes heavenward, \"Lord of the world!  Receive my spirit!\" and she gave up her soul to God.    The archangel Michael came and taught Seth how to prepare Eve for  burial, and three angels descended and interred her body in the  grave with Adam and Abel. Then Michael spoke to Seth, \"Thus shalt  thou bury all men that die until the resurrection day.\" And  again, having given him this command, he spoke: \"Longer than six  days ye shall not mourn.[139] The repose of the seventh day is  the token of the resurrection in the latter day, for on the  seventh day the Lord rested from all the work which He had  created and made.\"[140]    Though death was brought into the world through Adam, yet he  cannot be held responsible for the death of men. Once on a time  he said to God: \"I am not concerned about the death of the  wicked, but I should not like the pious to reproach me and lay  the blame for their death upon me. I pray Thee, make no mention  of my guilt.\" And God promised to fulfil his wish. Therefore,  when a man is about to die, God appears to him, and bids him set  down in writing all he has done during his life, for, He tells  him, \"Thou art dying by reason of thy evil deeds.\" The record  finished, God orders him to seal it with his seal. This is the  writing God will bring out on the judgment day, and to each will  be made known his deeds.[141] As soon as life is extinct in a  man, he is presented to Adam, whom he accuses of having caused  his death. But Adam repudiates the charge: \"I committed but one  trespass. Is there any among you, and be he the most pious, who  has not been guilty of more than one?\"[142]      III    THE TEN GENERATIONS  THE BIRTH OF CAIN  FRATRICIDE  THE PUNISHMENT OF CAIN  THE INHABITANTS OF THE SEVEN EARTHS  THE DESCENDANTS OF CAIN  THE DESCENDANTS OF ADAM AND LILITH  SETH AND HIS DESCENDANTS  ENOSH  THE FALL OF THE ANGELS  ENOCH, RULER AND TEACHER  THE ASCENSION OF ENOCH  THE TRANSLATION OF ENOCH  METHUSELAH        III    THE TEN GENERATIONS    THE BIRTH OF CAIN    There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, to show how  long-suffering is the Lord, for all the generations provoked Him  unto wrath, until He brought the deluge upon them.[1] By reason  of their impiousness God changed His plan of calling one thousand  generations into being between the creation of the world and the  revelation of the law at Mount Sinai; nine hundred and  seventy-four He suppressed before the flood.[2]    Wickedness came into the world with the first being born of  woman, Cain, the oldest son of Adam. When God bestowed Paradise  upon the first pair of mankind, He warned them particularly  against carnal intercourse with each other. But after the fall of  Eve, Satan, in the guise of the serpent, approached her, and the  fruit of their union was Cain, the ancestor of all the impious  generations that were rebellious toward God, and rose up against  Him. Cain's descent from Satan, who is the angel Samael, was  revealed in his seraphic appearance. At his birth, the  exclamation was wrung from Eve, \"I have gotten a man through an  angel of the Lord.\"[3]    Adam was not in the company of Eve during the time of her  pregnancy with Cain. After she had succumbed a second time to the  temptations of Satan, and permitted herself to be interrupted in  her penance,[4] she left her husband and journeyed westward,  because she feared her presence might continue to bring him  misery. Adam remained in the east. When the days of Eve to be  delivered were fulfilled, and she began to feel the pangs of  travailing, she prayed to God for help. But He hearkened not unto  her supplications. \"Who will carry the report to my lord Adam?\"  she asked herself. \"Ye luminaries in the sky, I beg you, tell it  to my master Adam when ye return to the east!\" In that self same  hour, Adam cried out: \"The lamentation of Eve has pierced to my  ear! Mayhap the serpent has again assaulted her,\" and he hastened  to his wife. Finding her in grievous pain, he besought God in her  behalf, and twelve angels appeared, together with two heavenly  powers.[5] All these took up their post to right of her and to  left of her, while Michael, also standing on her right side,  passed his hand over her, from her face downward to her breast,  and said to her, \"Be thou blessed, Eve, for the sake of Adam.  Because of his solicitations and his prayers I was sent to grant  thee our assistance. Make ready to give birth to thy child!\"  Immediately her son was born, a radiant figure.[6] A little while  and the babe stood upon his feet, ran off, and returned holding  in his hands a stalk of straw, which he gave to his mother. For  this reason he was named Cain, the Hebrew word for stalk of  straw.    Now Adam took Eve and the boy to his home in the east. God sent  him various kinds of seeds by the hand of the angel Michael, and  he was taught how to cultivate the ground and make it yield  produce and fruits, to sustain himself and his family and his  posterity.[7]    After a while, Eve bore her second son, whom she named Hebel,  because, she said, he was born but to die.      FRATRICIDE    The slaying of Abel by Cain did not come as a wholly unexpected  event to his parents. In a dream Eve had seen the blood of Abel  flow into the mouth of Cain, who drank it with avidity, though  his brother entreated him not to take all. When she told her  dream to Adam, he said, lamenting, \"O that this may not portend  the death of Abel at the hand of Cain!\" He separated the two  lads, assigning to each an abode of his own, and to each he  taught a different occupation. Cain became a tiller of the  ground, and Abel a keeper of sheep. It was all in vain. In spite  of these precautions, Cain slew his brother.[9]    His hostility toward Abel had more than one reason. It began when  God had respect unto the offering of Abel, and accepted it by  sending heavenly fire down to consume it, while the offering of  Cain was rejected.[10] They brought their sacrifices on the  fourteenth day of Nisan, at the instance of their father, who had  spoken thus to his sons: \"This is the day on which, in times to  come, Israel will offer sacrifices. Therefore, do ye, too, bring  sacrifices to your Creator on this day, that He may take pleasure  in you.\" The place of offering which they chose was the spot  whereon the altar of the Temple at Jerusalem stood later.[11]  Abel selected the best of his flocks for his sacrifice, but Cain  ate his meal first, and after he had satisfied his appetite, he  offered unto God what was left over, a few grains of flax seed.  As though his offense had not been great enough in offering unto  God fruit of the ground which had been cursed by God![12] What  wonder that his sacrifice was not received with favor! Besides, a  chastisement was inflicted upon him. His face turned black as  smoke.[13] Nevertheless, his disposition underwent no change,  even when God spoke to him thus: \"If thou wilt amend thy ways,  thy guilt will be forgiven thee; if not, thou wilt be delivered  into the power of the evil inclination. It coucheth at the door  of thy heart, yet it depends upon thee whether thou shalt be  master over it, or it shall be master over thee.\"[14]    Cain thought he had been wronged, and a dispute followed between  him and Abel. \"I believed,\" he said, \"that the world was created  through goodness,[15] but I see that good deeds bear no fruit.  God rules the world with arbitrary power, else why had He respect  unto thy offering, and not unto mine also?\" Abel opposed him; he  maintained that God rewards good deeds, without having respect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"and joined his voice with Judah's, and  the whole land was on the point of collapsing from the great  noise they produced. Joseph's valiant men lost their teeth,  and the cities of Pithom and Raamses were destroyed, and  they remained in ruins until the Israelites built them  up again under taskmasters. Also Judah's brethren, who  had kept quiet up to that moment, fell into a rage, and  stamped on the ground with their feet until it looked as  though deep furrows had been torn in it by a ploughshare.[275]  And Judah addressed his brethren, \"Be brave, demean yourselves  as men, and let each one of you show his heroism, for  the circumstances demand that we do our best.\"    Then they resolved to destroy Mizraim, the city of Egypt,  and Judah said, \"I will raise my voice, and with it destroy  Egypt.\"    Reuben: \"I will raise my arm, and crush it out of  existence.\"    Simon: \"I will raise my hand, and lay waste its palaces.\"    Levi: \"I will draw my sword, and slay the inhabitants  of Egypt.\"    Issachar: \"I will make the land like unto Sodom.\"    Zebulon: \"Like unto Gomorrah will I render it.\"    Dan: \"I will reduce it to a desert.\"[276]    Then Judah's towering rage began to show signs of breaking  out: his right eye shed tears of blood; the hair above  his heart grew so stiff that it pierced and rent the five  garments  in which he was clothed; and he took brass rods, bit  them with his teeth, and spat them out as fine powder.  When Joseph observed these signs, fear befell him, and in  order to show that he, too, was a man of extraordinary  strength, he pushed with his foot against the marble pedestal  upon which he sat, and it broke into splinters.  Judah exclaimed, \"This one is a hero equal to myself!\"  Then he tried to draw his sword from its scabbard in order  to slay Joseph, but the weapon could not be made to budge,  and Judah was convinced thereby that his adversary was a  God-fearing man, and he addressed himself to the task of  begging him to let Benjamin go free, but he remained  inexorable.[277]    Judah then said: \"What shall we say unto our father,  when he seeth that our brother is not with us, and he will  grieve over him?\"    Joseph: \"Say that the rope hath followed after the water  bucket.\"    Judah: \"Thou art a king, why dost thou speak in this  wise, counselling a falsehood? Woe unto the king that is  like thee!\"    Joseph: \"Is there a greater falsehood than that ye spake  concerning your brother Joseph, whom you sold to the  Midianites for twenty pieces of silver, telling your father,  An evil beast bath devoured him?\"    Judah: \"The fire of Shechem burneth in my heart, now  will I burn all thy land with fire.\"    Joseph: \"Surely, the fire kindled to burn Tamar, thy  daughter-in-law, who did kill thy sons, will extinguish the  fire of Shechem.\"    Judah: \"If I pluck out a single hair from my body, I will  fill the whole of Egypt with its blood.\"    Joseph: \"Such is it your custom to do; thus ye did unto  your brother whom you sold, and then you dipped his coat  in blood, brought it to your father, and said, An evil beast  hath devoured him, and here is his blood.\"    When Judah heard this, he was exceedingly wroth, and  he took a stone weighing four hundred shekels that was  before him, cast it toward heaven with one hand, caught it  with his left hand, then sat upon it, and the stone turned into  dust. At the command of Joseph, Manasseh did likewise  with another stone, and Joseph said to Judah: \"Strength  hath not been given to you alone, we also are powerful men.  Why, then, will ye all boast before us?\" Then Judah sent  Naphtali forth, saying, \"Go and count all the streets of the  city of Egypt and come and tell me the number,\" but Simon  interposed, saying, \"Let not this thing trouble you, I will  go to the mount, and take up one huge stone from the  mount, throw it over the whole of Mizraim, the city of  Egypt, and kill all therein.\"    Hearing all these words, which they spake aloud, because  they did not know that he understood Hebrew, Joseph bade  his son Manasseh make haste and gather together all the  inhabitants of Egypt, and all the valiant men, and let them  come to him on horseback and afoot. Meantime Naphtali  had gone quickly to execute Judah's bidding, for he was as  swift as the nimble hart, he could run across a field of corn  without breaking an ear. And he returned and reported  that the city of Egypt was divided into twelve quarters.  Judah bade his brethren destroy the city; he himself undertook  to raze three quarters, and he assigned the nine remaining  quarters to the others, one quarter to each.    In the meantime Manasseh had assembled a great army,  five hundred mounted men and ten thousand on foot,  among them four hundred valiant heroes, who could fight  without spear or sword, using only their strong, unarmed  hands. To inspire his brethren with more terror, Joseph  ordered them to make a loud noise with all sorts of instruments,  and their appearance and the hubbub they produced  did, indeed, cause fear to fall upon some of the brethren of  Joseph. Judah, however, called to them, \"Why are you  terrified, seeing that God grants us His mercy?\" He drew  his sword, and uttered a wild cry, which threw all the people  into consternation, and in their disordered flight many fell  over each other and perished, and Judah and his brethren  followed after the fleeing people as far as the house of  Pharaoh. Returning to Joseph, Judah again broke out in  loud roars, and the reverberations caused by his cries were  so mighty that all the city walls in Egypt and in Goshen fell  in ruins, the pregnant women brought forth untimely births,  and Pharaoh was flung from his throne. Judah's cries  were heard at a great distance, as far off as Succoth.    When Pharaoh learnt the reason of the mighty uproar, he  sent word to Joseph that he would have to concede the demands  of the Hebrews, else the land would suffer destruction.  \"Thou canst take thy choice,\" were the words of  Pharaoh, \"between me and the Hebrews, between Egypt  and the land of the Hebrews. If thou wilt not heed my command,  then leave me and go with them into their land.\"      JOSEPH MAKES HIMSELF KNOWN    Seeing that his brethren were, indeed, on the point of  destroying Egypt, Joseph resolved to make himself known  to them, and he cast around for a proper opening, which  would lead naturally to his announcement. At his behest,  Manasseh laid his hand upon Judah's shoulder, and his touch  allayed Judah's fury, for he noticed that he was in contact  with a kinsman of his, because such strength existed in no  other family. Then Joseph addressed Judah gently, saying:[278]  \"I should like to know who advised him to steal the  cup. Could it have been one of you?\" Benjamin replied:  \"Neither did they counsel theft, nor did I touch the cup.\"  \"Take an oath upon it,\" demanded Joseph, and Benjamin  complied with his brother's request: \"I swear that I did not  touch the cup! As true as my brother Joseph is separated  from me; as true as I had nothing to do with the darts that  my brethren threw at him; as true as I was not one of those  to take off his coat; as true as I had no part in the transaction  by which he was given over to the Ishmaelites; as true  as I did not help the others dip his coat in blood; so true  is my oath, that they did not counsel theft, and that I did  not commit theft.\"    Joseph: \"How can I know that this oath of thine taken  upon thy brother's fate is true?\"    Benjamin: \"From the names of my ten sons, which I  gave them in memory of my brother's life and trials, thou  canst see how dearly I loved him. I pray thee, therefore,  do not bring down my father with sorrow to the grave.\"    Hearing these words of abiding love, Joseph could refrain  himself no longer. He could not but make himself known  unto his brethren.[279] He spake these words to them: \"Ye  said the brother of this lad was dead. Did you yourselves  see him dead before you?\" They answered, \"Yes!\"    Joseph: \"Did you stand beside his grave?\"    The brethren: \"Yes!\"    Joseph: \"Did you throw clods of earth upon his corpse?\"    The brethren: \"No.\"    Then Joseph reflected, saying to himself: \"My brethren  are as pious as aforetime, and they speak no lies. They said  I was dead, because when they abandoned me, I was poor,  and 'a poor man is like unto a dead man;' they stood beside  my grave, that is the pit into which they cast me; but they  did not say that they had shovelled earth upon me, for that  would have been a falsehood.\"    Turning to his brethren, he said: \"Ye lie when ye say  that your brother is dead. He is not dead. You sold him,[280]  and I did buy him. I shall call him, and set him before your  eyes,\" and he began to call, \"Joseph, son of Jacob, come  hither! Joseph, son of Jacob, come hither! Speak to thy  brethren who did sell thee.\" The others turned their eyes  hither and thither, to the four corners of the house, until  Joseph called to them: \"Why look ye here and there? Behold, I am  Joseph your brother! \"Their souls fled away  from them, and they could make no answer, but God permitted  a miracle to happen, and their souls came back to  them.    Joseph continued, \"Ye see it with your own eyes, and also  my brother Benjamin seeth it with his eyes, that I speak  with you in Hebrew, and I am truly your brother.\" But  they would not believe him. Not only had he been transformed  from a smooth-faced youth into a bearded man since  they had abandoned him, but also the forsaken youth now  stood before them the ruler of Egypt. Therefore Joseph  bared his body and showed them that he belonged to the  descendants  of Abraham.    Abashed they stood there, and in their rage they desired  to slay Joseph as the author of their shame and their suffering.  But an angel appeared and flung them to the four  corners of the house. Judah raised so loud an outcry that  the walls of the city of Egypt tumbled down, the women"]]]
