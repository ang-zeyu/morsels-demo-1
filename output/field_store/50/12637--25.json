Nor were they tied[149] to  carry the dead to their respective parishes; but many of the dead taken  up in the city were carried to the burying ground in the outparts for  want of room.    At the beginning of the plague, when there was now no more hope but that  the whole city would be visited; when, as I have said, all that had  friends or estates in the country retired with their families; and when,  indeed, one would have thought the very city itself was running out of  the gates, and that there would be nobody left behind,--you may be sure  from that hour all trade, except such as related to immediate  subsistence, was, as it were, at a full stop.    This is so lively a case, and contains in it so much of the real  condition of the people, that I think I cannot be too particular in it,  and therefore I descend to the several arrangements or classes of people  who fell into immediate distress upon this occasion. For example:--    1. All master workmen in manufactures, especially such as belonged to  ornament and the less necessary parts of the people's dress, clothes,  and furniture for houses; such as ribbon-weavers and other weavers, gold  and silver lacemakers, and gold and silver wire-drawers, seamstresses,  milliners, shoemakers, hatmakers, and glovemakers, also upholsterers,  joiners, cabinet-makers, looking-glass-makers, and innumerable trades  which depend upon such as these,--I say, the master workmen in such  stopped their work, dismissed their journeymen and workmen and all their  dependents.    2. As merchandising was at a full stop (for very few ships ventured to  come up the river, and none at all went out[150]), so all the  extraordinary officers of the customs, likewise the watermen, carmen,  porters, and all the poor whose labor depended upon the merchants, were  at once dismissed, and put out of business.    3. All the tradesmen usually employed in building or repairing of houses  were at a full stop; for the people were far from wanting to build  houses when so many thousand houses were at once stripped of their  inhabitants; so that this one article[151] turned out all the ordinary  workmen of that kind of business, such as bricklayers, masons,  carpenters, joiners, plasterers, painters, glaziers, smiths, plumbers,  and all the laborers depending on such.    4. As navigation was at a stop, our ships neither coming in or going out  as before, so the seamen were all out of employment, and many of them in  the last and lowest degree of distress. And with the seamen were all the  several tradesmen and workmen belonging to and depending upon the  building and fitting out of ships; such as ship-carpenters, calkers,  ropemakers, dry coopers, sailmakers, anchor-smiths, and other smiths,  blockmakers, carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship-carvers, and the  like. The masters of those, perhaps, might live upon their substance;  but the traders were universally at a stop, and consequently all their  workmen discharged. Add to these, that the river was in a manner without  boats, and all or most part of the watermen, lighter-men, boat-builders,  and lighter-builders, in like manner idle and laid by.    5. All families retrenched their living as much as possible, as well  those that fled as those that staid; so that an innumerable multitude of  footmen, serving men, shopkeepers, journeymen, merchants' bookkeepers,  and such sort of people, and especially poor maidservants, were turned  off, and left friendless and helpless, without employment and without  habitation; and this was really a dismal article.    I might be more particular as to this part; but it may suffice to  mention, in general, all trades being stopped, employment ceased, the  labor, and by that the bread of the poor, were cut off; and at first,  indeed, the cries of the poor were most lamentable to hear, though, by  the distribution of charity, their misery that way was gently[152]  abated. Many, indeed, fled into the country; but, thousands of them  having staid in London till nothing but desperation sent them away,  death overtook them on the road, and they served for no better than the  messengers of death: indeed, others carrying the infection along with  them, spread it very unhappily into the remotest parts of the kingdom.    The women and servants that were turned off from their places were  employed as nurses to tend the sick in all places, and this took off a  very great number of them.    And which,[153] though a melancholy article in itself, yet was a  deliverance in its kind, namely, the plague, which raged in a dreadful  manner from the middle of August to the middle of October, carried off  in that time thirty or forty thousand of these very people, which, had  they been left, would certainly have been an insufferable burden by  their poverty; that is to say, the whole city could not have supported  the expense of them, or have provided food for them, and they would in  time have been even driven to the necessity of plundering either the  city itself, or the country adjacent, to have subsisted themselves,  which would, first or last, have put the whole nation, as well as the  city, into the utmost terror and confusion.    It was observable, then, that this calamity of the people made them very  humble; for now, for about nine weeks together, there died near a  thousand a day, one day with another, even by the account of the weekly  bills, which yet, I have reason to be assured, never gave a full account  by many thousands; the confusion being such, and the carts working in  the dark when they carried the dead, that in some places no account at  all was kept, but they worked on; the clerks and sextons not attending  for weeks together, and not knowing what number they carried. This  account is verified by the following bills of mortality:--                              Of All Diseases.  Of the Plague.      Aug. 8 to Aug. 15          5,319            3,880      Aug. 15 to Aug. 22         5,668            4,237      Aug. 22 to Aug. 29         7,496            6,102      Aug. 29 to Sept. 5         8,252            6,988      Sept. 5 to Sept. 12        7,690            6,544      Sept. 12 to Sept. 19       8,297            7,165      Sept. 19 to Sept. 30       6,400            5,533      Sept. 27 to Oct. 3         5,728            4,929      Oct. 3 to Oct. 10          5,068            4,227                                ------           ------                                59,918           49,605    So that the gross of the people were carried off in these two months;  for, as the whole number which was brought in to die of the plague was  but 68,590, here is[154] 50,000 of them, within a trifle, in two  months: I say 50,000, because as there wants 395 in the number above, so  there wants two days of two months in the account of time.[155]    Now, when I say that the parish officers did not give in a full account,  or were not to be depended upon for their account, let any one but  consider how men could be exact in such a time of dreadful distress, and  when many of them were taken sick themselves, and perhaps died in the  very time when their accounts were to be given in (I mean the parish  clerks, besides inferior officers): for though these poor men ventured  at all hazards, yet they were far from being exempt from the common  calamity, especially if it be true that the parish of Stepney had within  the year one hundred and sixteen sextons, gravediggers, and their  assistants; that is to say, bearers, bellmen, and drivers of carts for  carrying off the dead bodies.    Indeed, the work was not of such a nature as to allow them leisure to  take an exact tale[156] of the dead bodies, which were all huddled  together in the dark into a pit; which pit, or trench, no man could come  nigh but at the utmost peril. I have observed often that in the parishes  of Aldgate, Cripplegate, Whitechapel, and Stepney, there were five, six,  seven, and eight hundred in a week in the bills; whereas, if we may  believe the opinion of those that lived in the city all the time, as  well as I, there died sometimes two thousand a week in those parishes.  And I saw it under the hand of one that made as strict an examination as  he could, that there really died a hundred thousand people of the plague  in it that one year; whereas, in the bills, the article of the plague  was but 68,590.    If I may be allowed to give my opinion, by what I saw with my eyes, and  heard from other people that were eyewitnesses, I do verily believe the  same; viz., that there died at least a hundred thousand of the plague  only, besides other distempers, and besides those which died in the  fields and highways and secret places, out of the compass[157] of the  communication, as it was called, and who were not put down in the bills,  though they really belonged to the body of the inhabitants. It was known  to us all that abundance of poor despairing creatures who had the  distemper upon them, and were grown stupid or melancholy by their misery  (as many were), wandered away into the fields and woods, and into secret  uncouth[158] places, almost anywhere, to creep into a bush or hedge, and  die.    The inhabitants of the villages adjacent would in pity carry them food,  and set it at a distance, that they might fetch it if they were able;  and sometimes they were not able. And the next time they went they would  find the poor wretches lie[159] dead, and the food untouched. The number  of these miserable objects were[160] many; and I know so many that  perished thus, and so exactly where, that I believe I could go to the  very place, and dig their bones up still;[161] for the country people  would go and dig a hole at a distance from them, and then, with long  poles and hooks at the end of them, drag the bodies into these pits, and  then throw the earth in form, as far as they could cast it, to cover  them, taking notice how the wind blew, and so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#19)"],[1,"urn?\" he wanted to know.    Bud winked at the group, which cackled gleeful!, \"I love the sport of  kings,\" he said. \"I love it so well I don't have to see your Skeeter  horse till Sunday. From the way these boys sidestep him, I guess he's a  sure-enough running horse. My Smoky's a good little horse, too, but he  never scared a bunch till they had cramps in the pockets. Still,\"  he added with a grin, \"I'll try anything once. I bet you twenty-five  dollars my Smoky can beat your Skeeter.\"    \"Say, kid, honest I hate to take it away from yuh. Honest, I do. The way  you can knock the livin' tar outa that pyanny is a caution to cats. I  c'd listen all night. But when it comes to runnin' horses--\"    \"Are you afraid of your money?\" Bud asked him arrogantly. \"You called  this a bunch of pikers--\"    \"Well, by golly, it'll be your own fault, kid. If I take your money away  from yuh, don't go and blame it onto me. Mebbe these fellers has got  some cause to sidestep--\"    \"All right, the bet's on. And I won't blame you if I lose. Smoky's  a good little horse. Don't think for a minute I'm giving you my hard  earned coin. You'll have to throw up some dust to get it, old-timer. I  forgot to say I'd like to make it a quarter dash.\"    \"A quarter dash it is,\" Jeff agreed derisively as Bud turned to answer  the summons of the music which was beginning again.    The racing enthusiasts lingered outside, and Bud smiled to himself while  he whirled Honey twice around in an old-fashioned waltz. He had them  talking about him, and wondering about his horse. When they saw Smoky  they would perhaps call him a chancey kid. He meant to ask Pop about  Skeeter, though Pop seemed confident that Smoky would win against  anything in the valley.    But on the other hand, he had seen in his short acquaintance with Little  Lost that Pop was considered childish--that comprehensive accusation  which belittles the wisdom of age. The boys made it a point to humor him  without taking him seriously. Honey pampered him and called him Poppy,  while in Marian's chill courtesy, in her averted glances, Bud had read  her dislike of Pop. He had seen her hand shrink away from contact with  his hand when she set his coffee beside his plate.    But Bud had heard others speak respectfully of Boise, and regret that  he was too fast to run. Pop might be childish on some subjects, but  Bud rather banked on his judgment of horses--and Pop was penurious and  anxious to win money.    \"What are you thinking about?\" Honey demanded when the music stopped.  \"Something awful important, I guess, to make you want to keep right on  dancing!\"    \"I was thinking of horse-racing,\" Bud confessed, glad that he could tell  her the truth.    \"Ah, you! Don't let them make a fool of you. Some of the fellows would  bet the shirt off their backs on a horse-race! You look out for them,  Bud.\"    \"They wouldn't bet any more than I would,\" Bud boldly declared. \"I've  bet already against a horse I've never seen. How 's that?\"    \"That's crazy. You'll lose, and serve you right.\" She went off to dance  with someone else, and Bud turned smiling to find a passable partner  amongst the older women--for he was inclined to caution where strange  girls were concerned. Much trouble could come to a stranger who danced  with a girl who happened to have a jealous sweetheart, and Bud did  not court trouble of that kind. He much preferred to fight over other  things. Besides, he had no wish to antagonize Honey.    But his dance with some faded, heavy-footed woman was not to be. Jerry  once more signalled him and drew him outside for a little private  conference. Jerry was ill at ease and inclined to be reproachful and  even condemnatory.    He wanted first to know why Bud had been such a many kinds of a fool as  to make that bet with Jeff Hall. All the fellows were talking about it.  \"They was asking me what kind of a horse you've got--and I wouldn't put  it past Jeff and his bunch to pull some kind of a dirty trick on you,\"  he complained. \"Bud, on the square, I like you a whole lot. You seem  kinda innocent, in some ways, and in other ways you don't. I wish you'd  tell me just one thing, so I can sleep comfortable. Have you got some  scheme of your own? Or what the devil ails you?\"    \"Well, I've just got a notion,\" Bud admitted. \"I'm going to have some  fun watching those fellows perform, whether I win or lose. I've spent as  much as twenty-five dollars on a circus, before now, and felt that I got  the worth of my money, too. I'm going to enjoy myself real well, next  Sunday.\"    Jerry glanced behind him and lowered his voice, speaking close to Bud's  ear. \"Well, there's something I'd like to say that it ain't safe to say,  Bud. I'd hate like hell to see you get in trouble. Go as far as you like  having fun--but--oh, hell! What's the use?\" He turned abruptly and went  inside, leaving Bud staring after him rather blankly.    Jerry did not strike Bud as being the kind of a man who goes  around interfering with every other man's business. He was a quiet,  good-natured young fellow with quizzical eyes of that mixed color which  we call hazel simply because there is more brown than gray or green. He  did not talk much, but he observed much. Bud was strongly inclined  to heed Jerry's warning, but it was too vague to have any practical  value--\"about like Hen's note,\" Bud concluded. \"Well-meaning but hazy.  Like a red danger flag on a railroad crossing where the track is torn  up and moved. I saw one, once and my horse threw a fit at it and almost  piled me. I figured that the red flag created the danger, where I was  concerned. Still, I'd like to oblige Jerry and sidestep something or  other, but...\"    His thoughts grew less distinct, merged into wordless rememberings and  conjectures, clarified again into terse sentences which never reached  the medium of speech.    \"Well, I'll just make sure they don't try out Smoke when I'm not  looking,\" he decided, and slipped away in the dark.    By a roundabout way which avoided the trail he managed to reach the  pasture fence without being seen. No horses grazed in sight, and he  climbed through and went picking his way across the lumpy meadow in the  starlight. At the farther side he found the horses standing out on a  sandy ridge where the mosquitoes were not quite so pestiferous. The  Little Lost horses snorted and took to their heels, his three following  for a short distance.    Bud stopped and whistled a peculiar call invented long ago when he was  just Buddy, and watched over the Tomahawk REMUDA. Every horse with the  Tomahawk brand knew that summons--though not every horse would obey  it. But these three had come when they were sucking colts, if Buddy  whistled; and in their breaking and training, in the long trip north,  they had not questioned its authority. They turned and trotted back to  him now and nosed Bud's hands which he held out to them.    He petted them all and talked to them in an affectionate murmur which  they answered by sundry lipnibbles and subdued snorts. Smoky he singled  out finally, rubbing his back and sides with the flat of his hand from  shoulder to flank, and so to the rump and down the thigh to the hock  to the scanty fetlock which told, to those who knew, that here was an  aristocrat among horses.    Smoky stood quiet, and Bud's hand lingered there, smoothing the slender  ankle. Bud's fingers felt the fine-haired tail, then gave a little  twitch. He was busy for a minute, kneeling in the sand with one knee,  his head bent. Then he stood up, went forward to Smoky's head, and stood  rubbing the horse's nose thoughtfully.    \"I hate to do it, old boy--but I'm working to make's a home--we've got  to work together. And I'm not asking any more of you than I'd be willing  to do myself, if I were a horse and you were a man.\"    He gave the three horses a hasty pat apiece and started back across  the meadow to the fence. They followed him like pet dogs--and when Bud  glanced back over his shoulder he saw in the dim light that Smoky walked  with a slight limp.        CHAPTER TWELVE: SPORT O' KINGS    Sunday happened to be fair, with not too strong a wind blowing. Before  noon Little Lost ranch was a busy place, and just before dinner it  became busier. Horse-racing seemed to be as popular a sport in the  valley as dancing. Indeed, men came riding in who had not come to the  dance. The dry creek-bed where the horses would run had no road leading  to it, so that all vehicles came to Little Lost and remained there while  the passengers continued on foot to the races.    At the corral fresh shaven men, in clean shirts to distinguish this as a  dress-up occasion, foregathered, looking over the horses and making bets  and arguing. Pop shambled here and there, smoking cigarettes furiously  and keeping a keen ear toward the loudest betting. He came sidling up to  Bud, who was leading Smoky out of the stable, and his sharp eyes took in  every inch of the horse and went inquiringly to Bud's face.    \"Goin' to run him, young feller--lame as what he is?\" he demanded  sharply.    \"Going to try, anyway,\" said Bud. \"I've got a bet up on him, dad.\"    \"Sho! Fixin' to lose, air ye? You kin call it off, like as not. Jeff  ain't so onreason'ble 't he'd make yuh run a lame horse. Air yuh, Jeff?\"    Jeff strolled up and looked Smoky over with critical eyes. \"What's the  matter? Ain't the kid game to run him? Looks to me like a good little  goer.\"    \"He's got a limp--but I'll run him anyway.\" Bud glanced up. \"Maybe when  he's warmed up he'll forget about it.\"    \"Seen my Skeeter?\"    \"Good horse, I should judge,\" Bud observed indifferently. \"But I ain't  worrying any.\"    \"Well, neither am I,\" Jeff grinned.    Pop stood teetering back and forth, plainly uneasy. \"I'd rub him right  good with liniment,\" he advised Bud. \"I'll git some't I know ought t'  help.\"    \"What's the matter, Pop? You got money up on that cayuse?\" Jeff laughed.    Pop whirled on him. \""]]]
