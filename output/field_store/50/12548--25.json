(#19)"],[1,"abuela=: I say that it must  be abolished.    _Ataner_ (to bear upon) is only used in the 3rd pers., as--    Lo que atane al asunto: What bears on the subject.    Las noticias que atanen a nuestro proyecto: The news that bears on our  scheme.    _Concerner_ (to concern) is only used in the pres.  participle--concerniendo (concerning) and in the 3rd persons, as:  concierne (it concerns), etc.    =Pronominal Verbs= are verbs conjugated throughout with a double pronoun  of the same person, as--    _Amarse_--Yo me amo, tu te amas, el se ama, nosotros nos amamos,  vosotros os amais, ellos se aman.    These are--    1. Reflexive Verbs (when the action falls back on the subject. See  Lesson XVIII), as--Yo me amo: I love myself.    N.B.--The second pronoun must be direct object. If the second pronoun  is indirect object, the verb is called Transitive Pronominal, as--    Procurarse una clientela: To get a _clientele_ (a connection).    2. Intransitive Pronominal Verbs (see Lesson XIX).    3. Intransitive Verbs made Pronominal from verbs ordinarily transitive  (see Lesson XIX), as--    Hacerse, Volverse: To become.    La competencia se ha hecho imposible: Competition has become impossible.    4. The 3rd pers. pronominal forms the Passive Voice, same as the verb  _ser_, as--    La sabiduria se alaba _or_ es alabada: Wisdom is praised.    N.B.--If the doer is expressed after using _ser_ it may be preceded by  _de_ or _por_, as--    La sabiduria es alabada de _or_ por todos[134]: Wisdom is praised by  all.    [Footnote 134: When the verb does not mean a physical action _de_ is  preferable.]    If it is expressed after using _se_, =Por= must be used, as--    La sabiduria se alaba por todos: Wisdom is praised by all. (Grammar of  the Academy.)    Pronominal Verbs are used in Spanish very frequently in conjunction with  the article to avoid the use of the possessive adjective before parts of  the body, or articles of dress,[135] as--    Me he quebrado la pierna: I broke my leg.    Se ha danado los ojos, _or_ la vista: He has damaged his eyes or  eyesight.      [Footnote 135: The article is most generally substituted for the  possessive pronoun referring to parts of the body or articles of dress,  whenever this can be done _without producing ambiguity_, as--         Me dio la mano: He gave me his hand.       Tiene los ojos azules: His eyes are blue.       Le cogi el brazo: I caught his arm.       Me duele la cabeza: My head aches.       Me lastiman las botas: My boots hurt me.]      =Irregular Verbs= (_contd._).    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+  |               =Entender=[136] (to understand).                  |  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+  |_Pres.

(Leccion vigesima segunda.)                                   THE MOODS.      Mood is that form or modification of the Verb which marks the mode in  which an action is viewed or stated.      There are =5= moods in Spanish: one the Infinitive and =4= Finite, viz.,  the Indicative, Conditional, Subjunctive, and Imperative.      The =Infinitive Mood= (Modo Infinitivo) represents the action or state  of being without any reference to time or person. The present and past  participles are parts of the Infinitive Mood.    The Infinitive Mood may be used in the capacity of a noun either as  Subject or Object of the sentence. It is then generally (but not  necessarily) accompanied by the def. article, as--    El leer es util: To read is useful.  Me es necesario el leer: It is necessary for me to read.    The form of the Pres. Part. used in this capacity in English is  inadmissible in Spanish, e.g., we could never say \"leyendo\" for \"el  leer\" (or \"la lectura\").    The Infinitive Mood preceded by _a_ may have a passive meaning, as--    Una consignacion a hacer _or also_ a hacerse (a ser hecha): A shipment  to be made.    The Infinitive Mood preceded by _a_ may be used instead of the Finite  Mood introduced by \"if,\" as--    A saber yo que V. era accionista de aquella compania, le habria  comunicado luego aquella relacion: If I had known (or had I known) that  you were a shareholder in that society, I would have sent you at once  that report.  The =Present Participle= after \"to be\" is used in both languages to form  the continuous or progressive tenses; in Spanish this happens much less  frequently than in English, and only with verbs whose action implies  =duration of time= and besides when it is spoken of as =actually in  progress=. This form is never possible with the verb \"to go,\" and is  very rarely found with \"to come,\" as--    Miro aquellas Mantas y Terlices que me gustan: I am looking at those  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#19)"],[1,"press, 4to.
