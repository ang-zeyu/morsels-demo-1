She remained at her father's, a capable and kind woman being provided to  take constant charge of her, while Bob and Betty stayed on at the Oaks,  their uncle and aunt bringing them up with all the care and kindness  bestowed upon their own children; and Dick and Molly made their home at  Ion.    The latter was removed thither as soon as the danger to her mother's life  was past, the change being considered only temporary at the time; though  afterward it was decided to make it permanent, in accordance with the kind  and generous invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Travilla to her and her brother,  and their offer to become responsible for the education and present  support of both.    Little Elsie, bravely and earnestly striving to fill her mother's place in  the household, making herself companionable to her father, helping Eddie,  Vi and Harold with their lessons, comforting Herbie when his baby heart  ached so sorely with its longing for mamma, and in all his little griefs  and troubles, and settling the slight differences that would sometimes  arise between the children or the servants, found Molly an additional  burden; for she too must be cheered and consoled and was often fretful,  unreasonable and exacting.    Still the little girl struggled on, now feebly and almost ready to  despair, now with renewed hope and courage gathered from an interview with  her earthly or her heavenly Father.    Mr. Travilla was very proud of the womanly way in which she acquitted  herself at this time, her diligence, utter unselfishness, patience, and  thoughtfulness for others, and did not withhold the meed of well earned  praise; this with his advice and sympathy did much to enable her to  persevere to the end.    But oh what relief and joy when at last the dear mother was restored to  them and the unaccustomed burden lifted from the young shoulders!    It would have been impossible to say who rejoiced most heartily in the  reunion, father, mother or children. But every heart leaped lightly, every  face was bright with smiles.    Mrs. Travilla knew she was adding greatly to her cares, and to the  annoyances and petty trials of every day life, in taking Dick and  especially Molly into her family, but she realized it more and more as the  months and years rolled on; both had been so spoiled by Enna's unwise and  capricious treatment, that it was a difficult thing to control them; and  poor Molly's sad affliction caused her frequent fits of depression which  rendered her a burden to herself and to others; also she inherited to some  extent, her mother's infirmities of temper, and her envy, jealousy and  unreasonableness made her presence in the family a trial to her young  cousins.    The mother had to teach patience, meekness and forbearance by precept and  example, ever holding up as the grand motive, love to Jesus, and a desire  to please and honor him.    Such constant sowing of the good seed, such patient, careful weeding out  of the tares, such watchfulness and prayerfulness as Elsie bestowed upon  the children God had given her, could not fail of their reward from him  who has said, \"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\"; and as  the years rolled on she had the unspeakable joy of seeing her darlings one  after another gathered into the fold of the Good Shepherd;--consecrating  themselves in the dew of their youth to the service of him who had loved  them and washed them from their sins in his own blood.    She was scarcely less earnest and persistent in her efforts to promote the  welfare, temporal and spiritual, of Molly and Dick. She far more than  supplied the place of the mother now almost worse than lost to them.    They had always liked and respected her; they soon learned to love her  dearly and grew happier and more lovable under the refining, elevating  influence of her conduct and conversation.    She and her husband gave to both the best advantages for education that  money could procure, aroused in them the desire, and stimulated them to  earnest efforts to become useful members of society.    Elsie soon discovered that one grand element of Molly's depression was the  thought that she was cut off from all the activities of life and doomed,  by her sad affliction, to be a useless burden upon others.    \"My poor dear child!\" she said clasping the weeping girl in her arms,  \"that would be a sad fate indeed, but it need not be yours; there are many  walks of usefulness still open to you; literature, several of the arts and  sciences, music, painting, authorship; to say nothing of needle work both  plain and fancy. The first thing will be a good education in the ordinary  acceptation of the term--and that you can take as easily as one who has  use of all her limbs. Books and masters shall be at your command, and when  you have decided to what employment you will especially devote yourself,  every facility shall be given you for perfecting yourself in it.\"    \"O Cousin Elsie,\" cried the girl, her eyes shining, \"do you think I could  ever write books, or paint pictures? I mean such as would be really worth  the doing; such as would make Dick proud of me and perhaps give me money  to help him with; because you know the poor fellow must make his own way  in the world.\"    \"I scarcely know how to answer that question,\" Elsie said, smiling at her  sudden enthusiasm, \"but I do know that patience and perseverance will do  wonders, and if you practice them faithfully, it will not surprise me to  see you some day turn out a great author or artist.    \"But don't fret because Dick has not a fortune to begin with. Our very  noblest and most successful men have been those who had to win their way  by dint of hard and determined struggling with early disadvantages. 'Young  trees root the faster for shaking!'\" she added with a smile.    \"Oh then Dick will succeed, I know, dear, noble fellow!\" cried Molly  flushing with sisterly pride.    From that time she took heart and though there were occasional returns of  despondency and gloom she strove to banish them and was upon the whole,  brave, cheerful and energetic in carrying out the plans her cousin had  suggested.          CHAPTER SIXTEENTH.        \"It is as if the night should shade noonday,       Or that the sun was here, but forced away;       And we were left, under that hemisphere,       Where we must feel it dark for half a year.\"                                    --BEN. JOHNSON.      Since the events recorded in our last chapter, six years have rolled their  swift, though noiseless round, ere we look in upon our friends again; six  years bringing such changes as they must;--growth and development to the  very young, a richer maturity, a riper experience to those who had already  attained to adult life, and to the aged, increasing infirmities, reminding  them that their race is nearly run; it may be so with others; it must be  so with them.    There have been gains and losses, sickness and other afflictions, but  death has not yet entered any of their homes.    At Ion, the emerald, velvety lawn, the grand old trees, the sparkling  lakelet, the flower gardens and conservatories gay with rich autumn hues,  were looking their loveliest, in the light of a fair September morning.    The sun was scarcely an hour high, and except in the region of the  kitchen and stables quiet reigned within and without the mansion; doors  and windows stood wide open, and servants were busied here and there  cleaning and setting in order for the day, but without noise or bustle. In  the avenue before the front entrance, stood Solon with the pretty grey  ponies, Prince and Princess, ready saddled and bridled, while on the  veranda sat a tall, dark-eyed, handsome youth, a riding whip in one hand,  the other gently stroking and patting the head of Bruno, as it rested on  his knee; the dog receiving the caress with demonstrations of delight.    A light, springing step passed down the broad stairway, crossed the hall,  and a slender fairy-like form appeared in the doorway. It was Violet, now  thirteen, and already a woman in height; though the innocent childlike  trust in the sweet fair face and azure eyes, told another tale.    \"Good-morning, Eddie,\" she said. \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting.\"    \"Oh, good-morning,\" he cried, jumping up and turning toward her. \"No need  for apology, Vi, I've not been here over five minutes.\"    He handed her gallantly to the saddle, then mounted himself.    \"Try to cheer up, little sister; one should not be sad such a lovely  morning as this,\" he said, as they trotted down the avenue side by side.    \"Oh, Eddie,\" she answered, with tears in her voice, \"I do try, but I  can't yet; it isn't like home without them.\"    \"No; no indeed, Vi; how could it be? Mr. and Mrs. Daly are very kind, yet  not in the least like our father and mother; but it would be impossible  for any one to take their places in our hearts or home.\"    \"The only way to feel at all reconciled, is to keep looking forward to the  delight of seeing them return with our darling Lily well and strong,\" Vi  said, struggling bravely with her tears; and Eddie answered, \"I cannot  help hoping that may be, in spite of all the discouraging things the  doctors have said.\"    Lily, always frail and delicate, had drooped more and more during the past  year, and only yesterday the parents had left with her for the North,  intending to try the effect of different watering places, in the faint  hope that the child might yet be restored to health, or her life at least  be prolonged for a few years.    They had taken with them their eldest daughter, and infant son, and  several servants.    Aunt Chloe and Uncle Joe were not of the party, increasing infirmities  compelling them to stay behind.    The separation from her idolized mistress, cost the former many tears, but  she was much comforted by Elsie's assurance, that to have her at home to  watch over the children there,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#19)"],[1,"the lasso (which  is a long rope with a running noose, and is firmly fixed to his saddle)  either over the wild horse's head or in such a manner as to entangle his  hind legs; and by the sudden checking of his own horse, he throws the  captured animal over on its side.    9. In an instant he jumps off his horse, wraps his cloak round the head of  the captive, forces a bit into his mouth, and straps a saddle on his back.  He then removes the cloak, and the animal starts to his feet. With equal  quickness the hunter leaps into his saddle; and, in spite of the kicking  of the captive, keeps his seat, till, being wearied out with his efforts,  the horse submits to the guidance of his new master, and is reduced to  complete obedience.    10. Frank. But, Uncle Thomas, are all horses originally wild? I have heard  that Arabia is famous for raising horses.    11. Uncle Thomas. Arabia has, for a long time, been noted for the beauty  and speed of its horses. It is not strange, however, that the Arabian  horse should be the most excellent, when we consider the care and kindness  with which it is treated. One of the best stories which I have ever heard  of the love of an Arabian for his steed, is that related of an Arab, from  whom an English officer wished to purchase his horse.    12. The animal was a bright bay mare, of fine form and great beauty; and  the owner, proud of her appearance and qualities, paraded her before the  Englishman's tent until she attracted his attention. On being asked if he  would sell her, \"What will you give me?\" was the reply. \"That depends upon  her age. I suppose she is past five?\" \"Guess again,\" said he. \"Four?\"  \"Look at her mouth,\" said the Arab, with a smile. On examination she was  found to be about three. This, from her size and symmetry, greatly  increased her value.    13. The gentleman said, \"I will give you eighty tomans,\" (nearly two  hundred and fifty dollars). \"A little more, if you please,\" said the  fellow, somewhat entertained. \"Ninety--a hundred.\" He shook his head and  smiled. The officer at last came to three hundred tomans, (nearly one  thousand dollars). \"Well,\" said the Arab, \"you need not tempt me further.  You are a rich nobleman, and, I am told, have loads of silver and gold.  Now,\" added he, \"you want my mare, but you shall not have her for all you  have got.\" He put spurs to his horse, and was soon out of the reach of  temptation.    14. The horse can swim, when necessary, as well as most other animals,  although he is not very fond of the water. Some years ago a vessel was  driven upon the rocks, on the coast of the Cape of Good Hope, and most of  the crew fell an immediate sacrifice to the waves. Those who were left  were seen from the shore, clinging to the different pieces of the wreck.  The sea ran so high that no boat could venture off to their assistance.    15. Meanwhile, a planter had come from his farm to be a spectator of the  shipwreck. His heart was melted at the sight of the unhappy seamen, and,  knowing the bold spirit of his horse and his excellence as a swimmer, he  determined to make a desperate effort for their deliverance. Having blown  a little Brandy into his horse's nostrils, he pushed into the midst of the  breakers. At first both horse and rider disappeared, but it was not long  before they floated to the surface, and swam up to the wreck; when, taking  two men with him, each of whom held on by one of his boots, the planter  brought them safe to shore.    16. This was repeated no less than seven times, and he saved fourteen  lives; but on his return the eighth time, being much fatigued, and meeting  a tremendous wave, he lost his balance and sank in a moment. His horse  swam safely to land, but its gallant rider sank, to rise no more.      DEFINITIONS.--4. Im-mense', very large. In-hab'it-ed, occupied as a home.

In what country are the finest horses raised? Why  are the horses so excellent there? Are not animals always made better by  kind treatment? Why would not the Arab sell his horse? Relate the anecdote  of the planter and the shipwrecked seamen.        XLVIII. EMULATION. (132)    1. Frank's father was speaking to a friend, one day, on the subject of  competition at school. He said that he could answer for it that envy is  not always connected with it.    2. He had been excelled by many, but did not recollect ever having felt  envious of his successful rivals; \"nor did my winning many a prize from my  friend Birch,\" said he, \"ever lessen his friendship for me.\"    3. In support of the truth of this, a friend who was present related an  anecdote which had fallen under his own notice in a school in his  neighborhood.    4. At this school the sons of several wealthy farmers, and others, who  were poorer, received instruction. Frank listened with great attention  while the gentleman gave the following account of the two rivals:    5. It happened that the son of a rich farmer and the son of a poor widow  came in competition for the head of their class. They were so nearly equal  that the teacher could scarcely decide between them; some days one, and  some days the other, gained the head of the class. It was determined by  seeing who should be at the head of the class for the greater number of  days in the week.    6. The widow's son, by the last day's trial, gained the victory, and kept  his place the following week, till the school was dismissed for the  holidays.    7. When they met again the widow's son did not appear, and the farmer's  son, being next to him, might now have been at the head of his class.  Instead of seizing the vacant place, however, he went to the widow's house  to inquire what could be the cause of her son's absence.    8. Poverty was the cause; the poor woman found that she was not able, with  her utmost efforts, to continue to pay for the tuition and books of her  son, and so he, poor fellow! had been compelled to give up his schooling,  and to return to labor for her support.    9. The farmer's son, out of the allowance of pocket money which his father  gave him, bought all the necessary books and paid for the tuition of his  rival. He also permitted him to be brought back again to the head of his  class, where he continued for some time, at the expense of his generous  rival.      DEFINITIONS.--Em-u-la'tion, rivalry, contest. 1. Com-pe-ti'tion, rivalry.  2. Ex-celled', surpassed, exceeded in good qualities. Ri'vals, those who  pursue the same thing. 3. An'ec-dote, a short story. 8. Tu-i'tion, payment  for teaching.      EXERCISES.--What is the subject of this lesson? What do you mean by  emulation? What is envy? What story is told about the two rivals? Is it  right to envy any person?        XLIX. THE SANDPIPER. (134)  By CELIA THAXTER.    1. Across the lonely beach we flit,       One little sandpiper and I,     And fast I gather, bit by bit,       The scattered driftwood, bleached and dry.     The wild waves reach their hands for it,       The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,     As up and down the beach we flit,       One little sandpiper and I.    2. Above our heads the sullen clouds       Scud, black and swift, across the sky;     Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds       Stand out the white lighthouses high.     Almost as far as eye can reach       I see the close-reefed vessels fly,     As fast we flit across the beach,       One little sandpiper and I.    3. I watch him as he skims along,       Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;     He starts not at my fitful song,       Nor flash of fluttering drapery.     He has no thought of any wrong,       He scans me with a fearless eye;     Stanch friends are we, well-tried and strong,       The little sandpiper and I.    4. Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,       When the loosed storm breaks furiously?     My driftwood fire will burn so bright!       To what warm shelter canst thou fly?     I do not fear for thee, though wroth       The tempest rushes through the sky;     For are we not God's children both,       Thou, little sandpiper, and I?      DEFINITIONS.--l. Sand'pi-per, a bird of the snipe family, found along the  seacoast. Drift'wood. wood tossed on shore by the waves. Bleached,  whitened. Tide, the regular rise and fall of the ocean which occurs twice  in a little over twenty-four hours. 2. Scud, fly hastily. Shrouds, Winding  sheets, dresses of the dead.

(136)    Adapted from a story by Frank H. Stockton. He was born at Philadelphia,  April 5, 1834, and when quite a young boy used to write stories for his  own pleasure. He was once a designer and engraver on wood, and afterwards  an editor; but he now devotes himself entirely to writing, not only for  young but also for grown people.    1. \"O Andy!\" said little Jenny Murdock, \"I'm so glad you came along this  way. I can't get over.\"    2. \"Can't get over?\" said Andrew. \"Why what's the matter?\"    3. \"The bridge is gone,\" said Jenny. \"When I came across after breakfast  it was there, and now it's over on the other side, and how can I get back  home?\"    4. \"Why, so it is,\" said Andrew. \"It was all right when I came over a  little while ago, but old Donald pulls it on the other side every morning  after he has driven his cows across, and I don't think he has any right to  do "]]]
