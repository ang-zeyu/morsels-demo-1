I stood against it on my  toes, and I touched it with my finger-tips as high up as possible. Some  four feet severed them from the coping that left only half a sky above  my upturned eyes.    I do not know whether I have made it plain that the house was not  surrounded by four walls, but merely filled a breach in one of the  four, which nipped it (as it were) at either end. The back entrance was  approachable enough, but barred or watched, I might be very sure. It is  ever the vulnerable points which are most securely guarded, and it was  my one comfort that the difficult way must also be the safe way, if only  the difficulty could be overcome. How to overcome it was the problem.  I followed the wall right round to the point at which it abutted on the  tower that immured my love; the height never varied; nor could my hands  or eyes discover a single foot-hole, ledge, or other means of mounting  to the top.    Yet my hot head was full of ideas; and I wasted some minutes in trying  to lift from its hinges a solid, six-barred, outlying gate, that my  weak arms could hardly stir. More time went in pulling branches from the  oak-trees about the beck, where the latter ran nearest to the moonlit  wall. I had an insane dream of throwing a long forked branch over  the coping, and so swarming up hand-over-hand. But even to me the  impracticability of this plan came home at last. And there I stood in a  breathless lather, much time and strength thrown away together; and the  candle burning down for nothing in that little lofty window; and the  running water swirling noisily over its stones at my back.    This was the only sound; the wind had died away; the moonlit valley  lay as still as the dread old house in its midst but for the splash and  gurgle of the beck. I fancied this grew louder as I paused and listened  in my helplessness. All at once--was it the tongue of Nature telling me  the way, or common gumption returning at the eleventh hour? I ran down  to the water's edge, and could have shouted for joy. Great stones lay in  equal profusion on bed and banks. I lifted one of the heaviest in both  hands. I staggered with it to the wall. I came back for another; for  some twenty minutes I was so employed; my ultimate reward a fine heap of  boulders against the wall.    Then I began to build; then mounted my pile, clawing the wall to keep  my balance. My fingers were still many inches from the coping. I jumped  down and gave another ten minutes to the back-breaking work of carrying  more boulders from the water to the wall. Then I widened my cairn below,  so that I could stand firmly before springing upon the pinnacle with  which I completed it. I knew well that this would collapse under me if  I allowed my weight to rest more than an instant upon it. And so at last  it did; but my fingers had clutched the coping in time; had grabbed it  even as the insecure pyramid crumbled and left me dangling.    Instantly exerting what muscle I had left, and the occasion gave me,  I succeeded in pulling myself up until my chin was on a level with my  hands, when I flung an arm over and caught the inner coping. The other  arm followed; then a leg; and at last I sat astride the wall, panting  and palpitating, and hardly able to credit my own achievement. One great  difficulty had been my huge revolver. I had been terribly frightened it  might go off, and had finally used my cravat to sling it at the back  of my neck. It had shifted a little, and I was working it round again,  preparatory to my drop, when I saw the light suddenly taken from the  window in the tower, and a kerchief waving for one instant in its place.  So she had been waiting and watching for me all these hours! I dropped  into the garden in a very ecstasy of grief and rapture, to think that I  had been so long in coming to my love, but that I had come at last. And  I picked myself up in a very frenzy of fear lest, after all, I should  fail to spirit her from this horrible place.    Doubly desolate it looked in the rays of that bright October moon.  Skulking in the shadow of the wall which had so long baffled me, I  looked across a sharp border of shade upon a chaos, the more striking  for its lingering trim design. The long, straight paths were barnacled  with weeds; the dense, fine hedges, once prim and angular, had fattened  out of all shape or form; and on the velvet sward of other days you  might have waded waist high in rotten hay. Towards the garden end this  rank jungle merged into a worse wilderness of rhododendrons, the tallest  I have ever seen. On all this the white moon smiled, and the grim house  glowered, to the eternal swirl and rattle of the beck beyond its walls.    Long enough I stood where I had dropped, listening with all my being  for some other sound; but at last that great studded door creaked  and shivered on its ancient hinges, and I heard voices arguing in the  Portuguese tongue. It was poor Eva wheedling that black rascal Jose.  I saw her in the lighted porch; the nigger I saw also, shrugging and  gesticulating for all the world like his hateful master; yet giving in,  I felt certain, though I could not understand a word that reached me.    And indeed my little mistress very soon sailed calmly out, followed by  final warnings and expostulations hurled from the step: for the black  stood watching her as she came steadily my way, now raising her head to  sniff the air, now stooping to pluck up a weed, the very picture of a  prisoner seeking the open air for its own sake solely. I had a keen eye  apiece for them as I cowered closer to the wall, revolver in hand. But  ere my love was very near me (for she would stand long moments gazing  ever so innocently at the moon), her jailer had held a bottle to the  light, and had beaten a retreat so sudden and so hasty that I expected  him back every moment, and so durst not stir. Eva saw me, however,  and contrived to tell me so without interrupting the air that she was  humming as she walked.    \"Follow me,\" she sang, \"only keep as you are, keep as you are, close to  the wall, close to the wall.\"    And on she strolled to her own tune, and came abreast of me without  turning her head; so I crept in the shadow (my ugly weapon tucked out of  sight), and she sauntered in the shine, until we came to the end of  the garden, where the path turned at right angles, running behind the  rhododendrons; once in their shelter, she halted and beckoned me, and  next instant I had her hands in mine.    \"At last!\" was all that I could say for many a moment, as I stood there  gazing into her dear eyes, no hero in my heroic hour, but the bigger  love-sick fool than ever. \"But quick--quick--quick!\" I added, as she  brought me to my senses by withdrawing her hands. \"We've no time to  lose.\" And I looked wildly from wall to wall, only to find them as  barren and inaccessible on this side as on the other.    \"We have more time than you think,\" were Eva's first words. \"We can do  nothing for half-an-hour.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I'll tell you in a minute. How did you manage to get over?\"    \"Brought boulders from the beck, and piled 'em up till I could reach the  top.\"    I thought her eyes glistened.    \"What patience!\" she cried softly. \"We must find a simpler way of  getting out--and I think I have. They've all gone, you know, but Jose.\"    \"All three?\"    \"The captain has been gone all day.\"    Then the other two must have been my horse-men, very probably in some  disguise; and my head swam with the thought of the risk that I had run  at the very moment when I thought myself safest. Well, I would have  finished them both! But I did not say so to Eva. I did not mention  the incident, I was so fearful of destroying her confidence in me.  Apologizing, therefore, for my interruption, without explaining it, I  begged her to let me hear her plan.    It was simple enough. There was no fear of the others returning before  midnight; the chances were that they would be very much later; and  now it was barely eleven, and Eva had promised not to stay out above  half-an-hour. When it was up Jose would come and call her.    \"It is horrid to have to be so cunning!\" cried little Eva, with an angry  shudder; \"but it's no use thinking of that,\" she was quick enough to  add, \"when you have such dreadful men to deal with, such fiends! And I  have had all day to prepare, and have suffered till I am so desperate I  would rather die to-night than spend another in that house. No; let me  finish! Jose will come round here to look for me. But you and I will  be hiding on the other side of these rhododendrons. And when we hear him  here we'll make a dash for it across the long grass. Once let us get the  door shut and locked in his face, and he'll be in a trap. It will take  him some time to break in; time enough to give us a start; what's more,  when he finds us gone, he'll do what they all used to do in any doubt.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Say nothing till it's found out; then lie for their lives; and it was  their lives, poor creatures on the Zambesi!\" She was silent a moment,  her determined little face hard--set upon some unforgotten horror.  \"Once we get away, I shall be surprised if it's found out till morning,\"  concluded Eva, without a word as to what I was to do with her; neither,  indeed, had I myself given that question a moment's consideration.    \"Then let's make a dash for it now!\" was all I said or thought.    \"No; they can't come yet, and Jose is strong and brutal, and I  have heard how ill you are. That you should have come to me  notwithstanding--\" and she broke off with her little hands lying  so gratefully on my shoulders, that I know not how I refrained from  catching her then and there to my heart. Instead, I laughed and said  that my illness was a pure and deliberate sharp, and my presence there  its direct result.

But Jack began to wonder if he couldn't find something else besides  money in the sky. So one fine moonlight midsummer night he refused his  supper, and before he went to bed stole out to the garden with a big  watering-can and watered the ground under his window; for, thought he,  \"there must be two more beans somewhere, and perhaps it is too dry for  them to grow.\" Then he slept like a top.    And, lo and behold! when he woke, there was the green light shimmering  through his room, and there he was in an instant on the beanstalk,  climbing, climbing, climbing for all he was worth.    But this time he knew better than to ask for his breakfast; for the  ogre's wife would be sure to recognise him. So he just hid in some  bushes beside the great white house, till he saw her in the scullery,  and then he slipped out and hid himself in the copper; for he knew she  would be sure to look in the oven first thing.    And by and by he heard--                       Thump! THUMP! THUMP!    And peeping through a crack in the copper-lid, he could see the ogre  stalk in with three huge oxen strung at his belt. But this time, no  sooner had the ogre got into the house than he began shouting:      \"_Fee-fi-fo-fum,     I smell the blood of an Englishman.     Be he alive, or be he dead,     I'll grind his bones to make my bread._\"    For, see you, the copper-lid didn't fit tight like the oven door, and  ogres have noses like a dog's for scent.    \"Well, I declare, so do I!\" exclaimed the ogre's wife. \"It will be that  horrid boy who stole the bag of gold and the hen. If so, he's hid in the  oven!\"    But when she opened the door, lo and behold! Jack wasn't there! Only  some joints of meat roasting and sizzling away. Then she laughed and  said, \"You and me be fools for sure. Why, it's the boy you caught last  night as I was getting ready for your breakfast. Yes, we be fools to  take dead meat for live flesh! So eat your breakfast, there's a good  ogre!\"    But the ogre, though he enjoyed roast boy very much, wasn't satisfied,  and every now and then he would burst out with \"_Fee-fi-fo-fum_,\" and  get up and search the cupboards, keeping Jack in a fever of fear lest he  should think of the copper.    But he didn't. And when he had finished his breakfast he called out to  his wife, \"Bring me my magic harp! I want to be amused.\"    So she brought out a little harp and put it on the table. And the ogre  leant back in his chair and said lazily:                        \"Sing!\"    And, lo and behold! the harp began to sing. If you want to know what it  sang about? Why! It sang about everything! And it sang so beautifully  that Jack forgot to be frightened, and the ogre forgot to think of  \"_Fee-fi-fo-fum_,\" and fell asleep and                        did                      NOT                     SNORE.    Then Jack stole out of the copper like a mouse and crept hands and knees  to the table, raised himself up ever so softly and laid hold of the  magic harp; for he was determined to have it.    But, no sooner had he touched it, than it cried out quite loud, \"Master!  Master!\" So the ogre woke, saw Jack making off, and rushed after him.    My goodness, it was a race! Jack was nimble, but the ogre's stride was  twice as long. So, though Jack turned, and twisted, and doubled like a  hare, yet at last, when he got to the beanstalk, the ogre was not a  dozen yards behind him. There wasn't time to think, so Jack just flung  himself on to the stalk and began to go down as fast as he could, while  the harp kept calling, \"Master! Master!\" at the very top of its voice.  He had only got down about a quarter of the way when there was the most  awful lurch you can think of, and Jack nearly fell off the beanstalk. It  was the ogre beginning to climb down, and his weight made the stalk sway  like a tree in a storm. Then Jack knew it was life or death, and he  climbed down faster and faster, and as he climbed he shouted, \"Mother!  Mother! Bring an axe! Bring an axe!\"    Now his mother, as luck would have it, was in the backyard chopping  wood, and she ran out thinking that this time the sky must have fallen.  Just at that moment Jack touched ground, and he flung down the  harp--which immediately began to sing of all sorts of beautiful  things--and he seized the axe and gave a great chop at the beanstalk,  which shook and swayed and bent like barley before a breeze.    \"Have a care!\" shouted the ogre, clinging on as hard as he could. But  Jack _did_ have a care, and he dealt that beanstalk such a shrewd blow  that the whole of it, ogre and all, came toppling down, and, of course,  the ogre broke his crown, so that he died on the spot.    [Illustration: \"Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.\"]    [Illustration: Jack seized the axe and gave a great chop at the  beanstalk]    After that every one was quite happy. For they had gold and to spare,  and if the bed-ridden father was dull, Jack just brought out the harp  and said, \"Sing!\" And, lo and behold! It sang about everything under the  sun.    So Jack ceased wondering so much and became quite a useful person.    And the last bean still hasn't grown yet. It is still in the garden.    I wonder if it will ever grow?    And what little child will climb its beanstalk into the sky?    And what will that child find?    Goody me!          THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY      Long ago in Norroway there lived a lady who had three daughters. Now  they were all pretty, and one night they fell a-talking of whom they  meant to marry.    And the eldest said, \"I will have no one lower than an Earl.\"    And the second said, \"I will have none lower than a Lord.\"    But the third, the prettiest and the merriest, tossed her head and said,  with a twinkle in her eye, \"Why so proud? As for me I would be content  with the Black Bull of Norroway.\"    At that the other sisters bade her be silent and not talk lightly of  such a monster. For, see you, is it not written:      To wilder measures now they turn,      The black black Bull of Norroway;    Sudden the tapers cease to burn,      The minstrels cease to play.    So, no doubt, the Black Bull of Norroway was held to be a horrid  monster.    But the youngest daughter would have her laugh, so she said three times  that she would be content with the Black Bull of Norroway.    Well! It so happened that the very next morning a coach-and-six came  swinging along the road, and in it sate an Earl who had come to ask the  hand of the eldest daughter in marriage. So there were great rejoicings  over the wedding, and the bride and bridegroom drove away in the  coach-and-six.    Then the next thing that happened was that a coach-and-four with a Lord  in it came swinging along the road; and he wanted to marry the second  daughter. So they were wed, and there were great rejoicings, and the  bride and bridegroom drove away in the coach-and-four.    Now after this there was only the youngest, the prettiest and the  merriest, of the sisters left, and she became the apple of her mother's  eye. So you may imagine how the mother felt when one morning a terrible  bellowing was heard at the door, and there was a great big Black Bull  waiting for his bride.    She wept and she wailed, and at first the girl ran away and hid herself  in the cellar for fear, but there the Bull stood waiting, and at last  the girl came up and said:    \"I promised I would be content with the Black Bull of Norroway, and I  must keep my word. Farewell, mother, you will not see me again.\"    Then she mounted on the Black Bull's back, and it walked away with her  quite quietly. And ever it chose the smoothest paths and the easiest  roads, so that at last the girl grew less afraid. But she became very  hungry and was nigh to faint when the Black Bull said to her, in quite a  soft voice that wasn't a bellow at all:      \"Eat out of my left ear,       Drink out of my right,     And set by what you leave       To serve the morrow's night.\"    So she did as she was bid, and, lo and behold! the left ear was full of  delicious things to eat, and the right was full of the most delicious  drinks, and there was plenty left over for several days.    Thus they journeyed on, and they journeyed on, through many dreadful  forests and many lonely wastes, and the Black Bull never paused for bite  or sup, but ever the girl he carried ate out of his left ear and drank  out of his right, and set by what she left to serve the morrow's night.  And she slept soft and warm on his broad back.    Now at last they reached a noble castle where a large company of lords  and ladies were assembled, and greatly the company wondered at the sight  of these strange companions. And they invited the girl to supper, but  the Black Bull they turned into the field, and left to spend the night  after his kind.    But when the next morning came, there he was ready for his burden again.  Now, though the girl was loth to leave her pleasant companions, she  remembered her promise, and mounted on his back, so they journeyed on,  and journeyed on, and journeyed on, through many tangled woods and over  many high mountains. And ever the Black Bull chose the smoothest paths  for her and set aside the briars and brambles, while she ate out of his  left ear and drank out of his right.    So at last they came to a magnificent mansion where Dukes and Duchesses  and Earls and Countesses were enjoying themselves. Now the company,  though much surprised at the strange companions, asked the girl in to  supper; and the Black Bull they would have turned into the park for the  night, but that the girl, remembering how well he had cared for her,  asked them to put him into the stable and give him a good feed.    So this was done, and the next morning he was waiting before the  hall-door for his burden; and she, though somewhat loth at leaving the  fine company, mounted"]]]
