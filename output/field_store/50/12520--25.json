ADELAIDE (_seriously_).    I cannot see that ending of it as yet. I shall only see it when Ida  laughs once more as merrily as she used to do.    COLONEL (_excitedly walking about, exclaiming_).    Well then, I'll give him my child, and go and sit alone in a corner. I  had other views for my old age, but God forbid that my beloved girl  should be made unhappy by me. He is reliable and honorable, and will  take good care of her. I shall move back to the little town I came  from.    ADELAIDE (_seizing his hand_).    My revered friend, no--you shall not do that! Neither Oldendorf nor  Ida would accept their happiness at such a price. But if Senden and  his friends were secretly to take the paper away from the professor,  what then?    COLONEL (_joyfully_).    Then he would no longer be a journalist! (_Uneasily_.) But I won't  hear of such a thing. I am no friend of underhanded action.    ADELAIDE.    Nor am I! (_Heartily_.) Colonel, you have often shown a confidence in  me that has made me happy and proud. Even today you let me speak more  frankly than is usually permitted to a girl. Will you give me one more  great proof of your regard?    COLONEL (_pressing her hand_).    Adelaide, we know how we stand with each other. Speak out!    ADELAIDE.    For one hour, today, be my faithful knight. Allow me to lead you  wherever I please.    COLONEL.    What are you up to, child?    ADELAIDE.    Nothing wrong, nothing unworthy of you or of me. You shall not long be  kept in the dark about it.    COLONEL.    If I must, I will surrender. But may I not know something of what I  have to do?    ADELAIDE.    You are to accompany me on a visit, and at the same time keep in mind  the things we have just talked over so sensibly.    COLONEL.    On a visit?    _Enter_ KORB.    ADELAIDE.    On a visit I am making in my own interest.    KORB (_to_ ADELAIDE).    Mr. von Senden wishes to pay his respects.    COLONEL.    I don't wish to see him now.    ADELAIDE.    Be calm, Colonel! We have not time to be angry even with him. I shall  have to see him for a few moments.    COLONEL.    Then I will go away.    ADELAIDE (_entreating_).    But you will accompany me directly? The carriage is waiting.    COLONEL.    I obey the command. [_Exit to the left_.]    ADELAIDE.    I have made a hasty decision; I have ventured on something that was  doubtless too bold for a girl; for now that the crisis is at hand, I  feel my courage leaving me. I had to do it for his sake and for all  our sakes. (_To_ KORB.) Ask Miss Ida to get ready--the coachman will  come straight back for her. Dear Korb, let your thoughts be with me. I  am going on a weighty errand, old friend! [_Exit_ ADELAIDE.]    KORB.    (_alone_). Gracious, how her eyes shine! What is she tip to? She's not  going to elope with the old Colonel, I hope! Well, whatever she is up  to, she will carry it through. There is only one person who could ever  be a match for her. Oh, Mr. Conrad, if only I could speak!    [_EXIT_.]      SCENE II      _Editorial room of the Union. Enter_ BOLZ _through the door on the  left, directly afterward_ MILLER.    BOLZ (_at middle door_).    In here with the table!    MILLER (_carries small table, all set, with wine-bottles, glasses and  plates, to the foreground on the left; brings up five chairs while he  speaks_).    Mr. Piepenbrink sends his regards, with the message that the wine is  yellow-seal, and that, if the Doctor drinks any healths, he must not  forget Mr. Piepenbrink's health. He was very jolly, the stout  gentleman. And Madam Piepenbrink reminded him that he ought to  subscribe for the _Union_. He commissioned me to see to it.    BOLZ (_who meanwhile has been turning over papers at the work-table on  the right, rising_).    Let's have some wine!    [MILLER _pours some in a glass_.]    In honor of the worthy vintner! [_Drinks._]    I treated him scandalously, but he has proved true-hearted. Tell him  his health was not forgotten. There, take this bottle along!--Now, get  out!    [_Exit_ MILLER. BOLZ _opening the door on the left_.]    Come, gentlemen, today I carry out my promise.    [_Enter_ KAeMPE, BELLMAUS, KOeRNER.]    This is the lunch I agreed to give. And now, my charming day-flies,  put as much rose-color into your cheeks and your humors as your wits  will let you. [_Pouring out_.] The great victory is won; the _Union_  has celebrated one of the noblest of triumphs; in ages still to come  belated angels will say with awe: \"Those were glorious days,\" and so  on--see continuation in today's paper. Before we sit down, the first  toast--    KAeMPE. The member-elect--    BOLZ.    No, our first toast is to the mother of all, the great power which  produces members--the newspaper, may she prosper!    ALL.    Hurrah! [_Clink glasses_.]    BOLZ.    Hurrah! And secondly, long live--hold on, the member himself is not  here yet.    KAeMPE.    Here he comes.    _Enter_ OLDENDORF.    BOLZ.    The member from our venerable town, editor-in-chief and professor,  journalist, and good fellow, who is angry just now because behind his  back this and that got into the paper--hurrah for him!    ALL.    Hurrah!    OLDENDORF (_in a friendly tone_.)    I thank you, gentlemen.    BOLZ (_drawing_ OLDENDORF _to the front_).    And you are no longer vexed with us?    OLDENDORF.    Your intention was good, but it was a great indiscretion.    BOLZ.    Forget all about it! (_Aloud_.) Here, take your glass and sit down  with us. Don't be proud, young statesman! Today you are one of us.  Well, here sits the editorial staff! Where is worthy Mr.  Henning--where tarries our owner, printer and publisher, Gabriel  Henning?    KAeMPE.    I met him a little while ago on the stairs. He crept by me as shyly as  though he were some one who had been up to mischief.    BOLZ.    Probably he feels as Oldendorf does--he is again not pleased with the  attitude of the paper.    MILLER (_thrusting in his head_).    The papers and the mail!    BOLZ.    Over there! [MILLER _enters, lays the papers on the work-table._]    MILLER.    Here is the _Coriolanus_. There is something in it about our paper.  The errand-boy of the _Coriolanus_ grinned at me scornfully, and  recommended me to look over the article.    BOLZ.    Give it here! Be quiet, Romans, _Coriolanus_ speaks.--All ye devils,  what does that mean? [_Reads_.] \"On the best of authority we have just  been informed that a great change is imminent in the newspaper affairs  of our province. Our opponent, the _Union_, will cease to direct her  wild attacks against all that is high and holy.\"--This high and holy  means Blumenberg.--\"The ownership is said to have gone over into other  hands, and there is a sure prospect that we shall be able from now on  to greet as an ally this widely read sheet.\" How does that taste to  you, gentlemen?    MILLER} Thunder! KAeMPE.}_(All together_.) Nonsense! BELLMAUS.} It's a  lie!    OLDENDORF.    It's another of Blumenberg's reckless inventions.    BOLZ.    There is something behind it all. Go and get me Gabriel Henning.  [_Exit_ MILLER.] This owner has played the traitor; we have been  poisoned. [_Springing up._] And this is the feast of the Borgia!  Presently the _misericordia_ will enter and sing our dirge. Do me the  favor at least to eat up the oysters before it be too late.    OLDENDORF (_who has seized the newspaper_.)    Evidently this news is only an uncertain rumor. Henning will tell us  there is no truth in it. Stop seeing ghosts, and sit down with us.    BOLZ (_seating himself_).    I sit down, not because I put faith in your words, but because I don't  wish to do injustice to the lunch. Get hold of Henning; he must give  an account of himself.    OLDENDORF.    But, as you heard, he is not at home.    BOLZ (_zealously eating_).    Oh, thou wilt have a fearful awakening, little Orsini! Bellmaus, pour  me out some wine. But if the story be not true, if this _Coriolanus_  have lied, by the purple in this glass be it sworn I will be his  murderer! The grimmest revenge that ever an injured journalist took  shall fall on his head; he shall bleed to death from pin-pricks; every  poodle in the street shall look on him scornfully and say: \"Fie,  _Coriolanus_, I wouldn't take a bite at you even if you were a  sausage.\" [_A knock is heard_. BOLZ _lays down his knife.] Memento  mori_! There are our grave-diggers. The last oyster, now, and then  farewell thou lovely world!    _Enter_ JUDGE SCHWARZ _and_ SENDEN _from the door on the left; the  door remains open_.    SCHWARZ.    Obedient servant, gentlemen!    SENDEN.    Your pardon if we disturb you.    BOLZ (_remaining seated at the table_).    Not in the least. This is our regular luncheon, contracted for a whole  year--fifty oysters and two bottles daily for each member of the  staff. Whoever buys the newspaper has to furnish it.    SCHWARZ.    What brings us here, Professor, is a communication which Mr. Henning  should have been the first to make to you. He preferred handing over  the task to me.    OLDENDORF.    I await your communication.    SCHWARZ.    Mr. Henning has, from yesterday on, transferred to me by sale all  rights pertaining to him as owner of the newspaper _Union_.    OLDENDORF.    To you, Judge?    SCHWARZ.    I acknowledge that I have bought it merely as accredited agent of a  third person. Here is the deed; it contains no secrets. [_Hands him a  paper_.]    OLDENDORF (_looking through it, to_ BOLZ).    It is drawn up by a notary in due form--sold for thirty thousand  thalers. [_Agitation among the staff-members_.] Let me get to the  bottom of the matter. Is this change of owner also to be connected  with a change in the political attitude of the sheet?    SENDEN (_coming forward_).    Certainly, Professor, that was the intention in making the purchase.    OLDENDORF.    Do I possibly see in you the new owner?    SENDEN.    Not that, but I have the honor to be a friend of his.

That it is his duty to see that all  persons exposing any wares for sale in the fairs or markets, or as  shopkeepers within the manor, have legal weights and measures.\"    The other officers of the Court Leet, whose duties are also defined in  the aforesaid pamphlet, are the \"Constables,\" the \"Headborough,\" two  \"Affeirers\" (who looked after the rents and dues belonging to the Lord  of the Manor), two \"Leather Sealers\" (once important officers, when  there was a Leather Market, but whose duties in and about the year named  seemed to be confined to attending at the yearly dinners given by the  High Bailiff), two \"Ale-conners, otherwise high tasters,\" and two  \"Flesh-conners, otherwise low tasters.\" From their name it might be  thought the duties of the last named officers were limited to the  inspection of meat or flesh, but it will be seen that they were of a  more comprehensive character:--        \"Their duty is to see that all butchers, fishmongers, poulterers,    bakers, and other sellers of victuals, do not sell or expose to sale    within this Manor any unwholesome, corrupt, or contagious flesh, fish,    or other victuals; and in case any such be exposed to sale, we find    that the said Officers, by the ancient custom of the Manor may seize,    burn, or destroy the same, or otherwise present the offenders at the    next Court Leet to be holden for this Manor.\"        As we are now officered, inspectored and policed, and generally looked  after as to our eating and drinking, &c., in the most improved modern  style possible, it is not necessary to further fill space by saying what  the \"Headborough\" had to do, or how many \"Constables\" assisted him. The  last meeting of the Court Leet, long shorn of all its honours and  privileges, was held October 28, 1851.    ~Court Of Record.~--This was also called the \"Mayor's Court,\" and was  authorised in the Charter of Incorporation for the recovery of small  debts under L20, the officers consisting of a Judge, Registrar, and two  Sergeants-at-Mace. In 1852 (Oct. 26) the Town Council petitioned the  Queen to transfer its powers to the County Court, which was acceded to  in the following spring.    ~Court of Requests.~--Constituted by Act of Parliament in 1752 this  Court for \"the more easy and speedy recovery of small debts within the  town of Birmingham and the adjoining hamlet of Deritend\" continued in  operation until the present County Court system became the law of the  land. Its powers were originally limited to debts not exceeding 40s. in  amount (which was increased to L5 by an Act passed in 1807), the periods  of imprisonment to which defaulting debtors were liable being  apportioned out at the rate of one day in durance for each shilling due,  except in special cases, wherein an addition (not to exceed three  months) might be the reward for fraudulent concealment of property from  creditors. The \"Court\" consisted of no less than six dozen judges, or,  as the Act styled them, \"Commissioners,\" from whose decisions there was  no appeal whatever. These Commissioners were at first chosen from the  ratepayers in a haphazard style, no mental or property qualification  whatever being required, though afterwards it was made incumbent that  they should be possessed of an income from real estate to value of L50  per year, or be worth L1,000 personalty. From the writings of William  Hutton, himself one of the Commissioners, and other sources, we gather  that justice, or what was supposed to be equivalent thereto, was  administered in a rough-and-ready fashion of the rudest kind, the cases  being frequently disposed of at the rate of thirty to forty per hour,  and when we consider that imprisonment resulted at an average of one  case in ten the troubles attendant upon impecuniosity in those days may  be better imagined then described. The Court House, which is now  occupied by sundry tradesmen, lay a little back from High-street, nearly  opposite New-street, and in itself was no mean structure, having been  (it is said), erected about the year 1650, as the town house of John  Jennens, or Jennings, one of the wealthy family, the claims to whose  estates have been unending, as well as unprofitable, barring, of course,  to the long-robed and bewigged fraternity. A narrow passage from the  right of the entrance hall leads by a dark winding staircase to the  cellars, now filled with merchandise, but which formerly constituted the  debtors' prison, or, as it was vulgarly called, \"The Louse Hole,\" and  doubtless from its frequently-crowded and horribly-dirty condition, with  half-starved, though often debauched and dissipated, occupants, the  nasty name was not inappropriately given. Shocking tales have been told  of the scenes and practices here carried on, and many are still living  who can recollect the miserable cry of \"Remember the poor debtors,\"  which resounded morning, noon, and night from the heavily-barred windows  of these underground dungeons. The last batch of unfortunates here  confined were liberated August 16, 1844.    ~Creche.~--An institution which has been open in Bath Row for several  years, and a great blessing to many poor mothers in its neighbourhood,  but it is so little known that it has not met with the support it  deserves, and is therefore crippled in its usefulness for want of more  subscribers. The object of the institution is to afford, during the  daytime, shelter, warmth, food, and good nursing to the infants and  young children of poor mothers who are compelled to be from home at  work. This is done at the small charge of 2d. per day--a sum quite  inadequate to defray the expenses of the charity. The average number of  children so sheltered is about 100 per week, and the number might be  greatly increased if there were more funds. Gifts of coal, blankets,  linen, perambulators, toys, pictures, &c., are greatly valued, and  subscriptions and donations will be gladly received by the hon.  treasurer.    ~Crescent,~ Cambridge Street.--When built it was thought that the  inhabitants of the handsome edifices here erected would always have an  extensive view over gardens and green fields, and certainly if chimney  pots and slated roofs constitute a country landscape the present  denizens cannot complain. The ground belongs to the Grammar School, the  governors of which leased it in 1789 to Mr. Charles Norton, for a term  of 120 years, at a ground rent of L155 10s. per year, the lessee to  build 34 houses and spend L12,000 thereon; the yearly value now is about  L1,800. On the Crescent Wharf is situated the extensive stores of  Messrs. Walter Showell & Sons, from whence the daily deliveries of  Crosswells Ales are issued to their many Birmingham patrons. Here may be  seen, stacked tier upon tier, in long cool vistas, close upon 6,000  casks of varying sizes containing these celebrated ales, beers, and  stouts. This stock is kept up by daily supplies from the brewery at  Langley Green, many boats being employed in the traffic.    ~Cricket.~--See \"_Sports_.\"    ~Crime.~--A few local writers like to acknowledge that Birmingham is any  worse than other large towns in the matter of crime and criminals, and  the old adage respecting the bird that fouls its own nest has been more  than once applied to the individuals who have ventured to demur from the  boast that ours is _par excellence_, a highly moral, fair-dealing,  sober, and superlatively honest community. Notwithstanding the character  given it of old, and the everlasting sneer that is connected with the  term \"Brummagem,\" the fast still remains that our cases of drunkenness  are far less than in Liverpool, our petty larcenies fewer than in Leeds,  our highway robberies about half compared with Manchester, malicious  damage a long way under Sheffield, and robberies from the person not  more than a third of those reported in Glasgow; while as to smashing and  coining, though it has been flung at us from the time of William of  Orange to the present day; that all the bad money ever made _must_ be  manufactured here, the truth is that five-sixths of the villainous crew  who deal in that commodity obtain their supplies from London, and _not_  from our little \"hardware village.\" But alas! there _is_ a dark side to  the picture, indeed, for, according to the Registrar-General's return of  June, 1879 (and the proportionate ratio, we are sorry to say, still  remains the same), Birmingham holds the unenviable position of being the  town where most deaths from violence occur, the annual rate per 1,000  being 1.08 in Birmingham, 0.99 in Liverpool, 0.38in Sheffield, 0.37 in  Portsmouth, the average for the kingdom being even less than that--\"the  proportional fatality from violence being almost invariably more than  twice as large in Birmingham as in Sheffield.\"    ~Cross.~--In the Bull Ring, when Hutton first came here, a poor wayfarer  seeking employ, there was a square building standing on arches called  \"The Cross,\" or \"Market Cross,\" the lower part giving a small shelter to  the few countrywomen who brought their butter and eggs to market, while  the chamber above provided accommodation for meetings of a public  character. When the Corn Cheaping, the Shambles, and all the other  heterogeneous collection of tumbledown shanties and domiciles which in  the course of centuries had been allowed to gather round St. Martin's  were cleared away, the Market Cross was demolished, and its exact site  is"]]]
