[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#19)"],[1," the latter glanced down at  his side.    By some chance, perhaps because of his struggle with Peake, Wass' beam  had not struck true, the main core of the bolt passing between his arm  and his side, burning both. How deeply he could not tell, in fact he  did not want to find out. It was enough that the tablets had banished  the pain now.    \"Seared a little,\" he said. \"You've a bad cut on your head.\"    Hume frowned. \"Can we make the flitter?\"    Vye moved, then relaxed quickly into his former position. \"Not now,\"  he evaded, knowing that neither of them would be able to take that  climb.    \"Beam on?\" Hume repeated Vye's thoughts of moments before. \"Patrol  coming?\"    Yes, eventually the Patrol would come--but when? Hours--days? Time was  their enemy now. He did not have to say any of that, they both knew.    \"Needler--\" Hume's head had turned in the other direction; now his  hand pointed waveringly to the weapon in the dust.    \"They won't be back,\" Vye stated the obvious. Those others had been  caught in the trap, the odds on their return without aid were very  high.    \"Needler!\" Hume repeated more firmly, and tried to sit up, falling  back with a sharp intake of breath.    Vye edged around, stretched out his leg and scraped the toe of his  boot into the loop of the carrying sling, drawing the weapon up to  where he could get his hand on it. As he steadied it across his knee  Hume spoke again:    \"Watch for trouble!\"    \"They all went in,\" Vye protested.    But Hume's eyes had closed again. \"Trouble--maybe....\" His voice  trailed off. Vye rested his hand on the stock of the needler.    \"Hoooooo!\"    That beast wail--as they had heard it in the valley! Somewhere from  the wood. Vye brought the needler around, so that the sights pointed  in that direction. There death might be hunting, but there was nothing  he could do.    A scream, filled with all the agony of a man in torment, caught up on  the echoes of that other cry. Vye sighted a wild waving of bushes. A  figure, very small and far away, crawled into the open on hands and  knees and then crumpled into only a shadowy blot on the moss. Again  the beast's cry, and a shouting!    Vye watched a second man back out of the trees, still facing whatever  pursued him. He caught the glint of sun on what must be a ray tube.  Leaves crisped into a black hole, curls of smoke arose along the path  of that blast.    The man kept on backing, passed the inert body of his companion,  glancing now and then over his shoulder at the slope up which he was  making a slow but steady way. He no longer rayed the bush, but there  was the crackle of a small fire outlining the ragged hole his beam had  cut.    Back two strides, three. Then he turned, made a quick dash, again  facing around after he had gained some yards in the open. Vye saw now  it was Wass.    Another dash and an about face. But this time to confront the enemy.  There were three of them, as monstrous as those Vye and Hume had  fought in the same place. And one of them was wounded, swinging a  charred forepaw before it, and giving voice to a wild frenzy of roars.    Wass leveled the ray tube, centered sights on the beast nearest to  him. The man hammered at the firing button with the flat of his other  hand, and almost paid for that second of distraction with his life,  for the creature made one of those lightning swift dashes Vye had so  luckily escaped. The clawed forepaw tore a strip from the shoulder of  Wass' tunic, left sprouting red furrows behind. But the man had thrown  the useless tube into its face, was now running for the gap.    Vye held the needler braced against his knee to fire. He saw the dart  quiver in the upper arm of the beast, and it halted to pull out that  sliver of dangerously poisoned metal, crumpled it into a tight twist.  Vye continued to fire, never sure of his aim, but seeing those slivers  go home in thick legs, in outstretched forelimbs, in wide, pendulous  bellies. Then there were three blue shapes lying on the slope behind  the man running straight for the gap.    Wass hit the invisible barrier full force, was hurled back, to lie  gasping on the turf, but already raising himself to crawl again to the  gateway he saw and could not believe was barred. Vye closed his eyes.  He was very tired now--tired and sleepy--maybe the pain pills were  bringing the secondary form of relief. But he could hear, just beyond,  the man who beat at that unseen curtain, first in anger and fear, and  then just in fear, until the fear was a lonesome crying that went on  and on until even that last feeble assault on the barrier failed.           *       *       *       *       *    \"We have here the tape report of Ras Hume, Out-Hunter of the Guild.\"    Vye watched the officer in the black and silver of the Patrol, a black  and silver modified with the small, green, eye badge of X-Tee, with  level and hostile gaze.    \"Then you know the story.\" He was going to make no additions nor  explanations. Maybe Hume had cleared him. All right, that was all he  would ask, to be free to go his way and forget about Jumala--and Ras  Hume.    He had not seen the Hunter since they had both been loaded into the  Patrol flitter in the gap. Wass had come out of the valley a witless,  dazed creature, still under the mental influence of whoever, or  whatever, had set that trap. As far as Vye knew the Veep had not yet  recovered his full senses, he might never do so. And if Hume had not  dictated that confession to damn himself before the Patrol, he might  have escaped. They could suspect--but they would have had no proof.    \"You continue to refuse to tape?\" The officer favored him with one of  the closed-jaw looks Vye had often seen on the face of authority.    \"I have my rights.\"    \"You have the right to claim victim compensation--a good compensation,  Lansor.\"    Vye shrugged and then winced at a warning from the tender skin over  ribs.    \"I make no claim, and no tape,\" he repeated. And he intended to go on  saying that as long as they asked him. This was the second visit in  two days and he was getting a little tired of it all. Perhaps he  should do as prudence dictated and demand to be returned to Nahuatl.  Only his odd, unexplainable desire to at least see Hume kept him from  making the request they would have to honor.    \"You had better reconsider.\" Authority resumed.    \"Rights of person--\" Vye almost grinned as he recited that. For the  first time in his pushed-around life he could use that particular  phrase and make it stick. He thought there was a sour twist to the  officer's mouth, but the other still retained his impersonal tone as  he spoke into the intership com:    \"He refused to make a tape.\"    Vye waited for the other's next move. This should mark the end of  their interview. But instead the officer appeared to relax the  restraint of his official manner. He brought a viv-root case from an  inner pocket, offered a choice of contents to Vye, who gave an instant  and suspicious refusal by shake of head. The officer selected one of  the small tubes, snapped off the protecto-nib, and set it between his  lips for a satisfying and lengthy pull. Then the panel of the cabin  door pushed open, and Vye sat up with a jerk as Ras Hume, his head  banded with a skin-core covering, entered.    The officer waved his hand at Vye with the air of one turning over a  problem. \"You were entirely right. And he's all yours, Hume.\"    Vye looked from one to the other. With Hume's tape in official hands  why wasn't the Hunter under restraint? Unless, because they were  aboard the Patrol cruiser, the officers didn't think a closer  confinement was necessary. Yet the Hunter wasn't acting the role of  prisoner very well. In fact he perched on a wall-flip seat with the  ease of one completely at home, accepted the viv-root Vye had refused.    \"So you won't make a tape,\" he asked cheerfully.    \"You act as if you want me to!\" Vye was so completely baffled by this  odd turn of action that his voice came out almost plaintively.    \"Seeing as how a great deal of time and effort went into placing you  in the position where you _could_ give us that tape, I must admit some  disappointment.\"    \"Give _us_?\" Vye echoed.    The officer removed the viv-root from between his lips. \"Tell him the  whole sad story, Hume.\"    But Vye began to guess. Life in the Starfall, or as port-drift, either  sharpened the wits or deadened them. Vye's had suffered the burnishing  process. \"A set-up?\"    \"A set-up,\" Hume agreed. Then he glanced at the Patrol officer a  little defensively. \"I might as well tell the whole truth--this  didn't quite begin on the right side of the law. I had my reasons for  wanting to make trouble for the Kogan estate, only not because of the  credits involved.\" He moved his plasta-flesh hand. \"When I found that  L-B from the Largo Drift and saw the possibilities, did a little day  dreaming--I worked out this scheme. But I'm a Guild man and as it  happens, I want to stay one. So I reported to one of the Masters and  told him the whole story--why I hadn't taped on the records my  discovery on Jumala.    \"When he passed along the news of the L-B to the Patrol, he also  suggested that there might be room for fraud along the way I had  thought it out. That started a chain reaction. It happened that the  Patrol wanted Wass. But he was too big and slick to be caught in a  case which couldn't be broken in court. They thought that here was  just the bait he might snap at, and I was the one to offer it to him.  He could check on me, learn that I had excellent reason to do what I  said I was doing. So I went to him with my story and he liked it. We  made the plan work just as I had outlined it. And he planted Rovald on  me as a check. But I didn't know Yactisi was a plant, also.\"    The Patrol officer smiled. \"Insurance,\" he waved the viv-root, \"just  insurance.\"    \"What we didn't foresee was this complicating alien trouble. You were  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#19)"],[1," same stages as the poetry of the Nativity. There is first a monastic and  hieratic stage, when the drama is but an expansion of the liturgy, a  piece of ceremonial performed by clerics with little attempt at  verisimilitude and with Latin words drawn mainly from the Bible or the  offices of the Church. Then, as the laity come to take a more personal  interest in Christianity, we find fancy beginning to play around the  subject, bringing out its human pathos and charm, until, after a  transitional stage, the drama leaves the sanctuary, passes from Latin to  the vulgar tongue, is played by lay performers in the streets and squares  of the city, and, while its framework remains religious, takes into  itself episodes of a more or less secular character. The Latin liturgical  plays are to the \"miracles\" and \"mysteries\" of the later Middle Ages as a  Romanesque church, solemn, oppressive, hieratic, to |122| a Gothic  cathedral, soaring, audacious, reflecting every phase of the popular  life.    The mediaeval religious drama{1} was a natural development from the  Catholic liturgy, not an imitation of classical models. The classical  drama had expired at the break-up of the Roman Empire; its death was due  largely, indeed, to the hostility of Christianity, but also to the rude  indifference of the barbarian invaders. Whatever secular dramatic  impulses remained in the Dark Ages showed themselves not in public and  organized performances, but obscurely in the songs and mimicry of  minstrels and in traditional folk-customs. Both of these classes of  practices were strongly opposed by the Church, because of their  connection with heathenism and the licence towards which they tended. Yet  the dramatic instinct could not be suppressed. The folk-drama in such  forms as the Feast of Fools found its way, as we shall see, even into the  sanctuary, and--most remarkable fact of all--the Church's own services  took on more and more a dramatic character.    While the secular stage decayed, the Church was building up a stately  system of ritual. It is needless to dwell upon the dramatic elements in  Catholic worship. The central act of Christian devotion, the Eucharist,  is in its essence a drama, a representation of the death of the Redeemer  and the participation of the faithful in its benefits, and around this  has gathered in the Mass a multitude of dramatic actions expressing  different aspects of the Redemption. Nor, of course, is there merely  symbolic _action_; the offices of the Church are in great part  _dialogues_ between priest and people, or between two sets of singers. It  was from this antiphonal song, this alternation of versicle and respond,  that the religious drama of the Middle Ages took its rise. In the ninth  century the \"Antiphonarium\" traditionally ascribed to Pope Gregory the  Great had become insufficient for ambitious choirs, and the practice grew  up of supplementing it by new melodies and words inserted at the  beginning or end or even in the middle of the old antiphons. The new  texts were called \"tropes,\" and from the ninth to the thirteenth century  many were written. An interesting Christmas |123| example is the  following ninth-century trope ascribed to Tutilo of St. Gall:--        \"Hodie cantandus est nobis puer, quem gignebat ineffabiliter ante      tempora pater, et eundem sub tempore generavit inclyta mater. (To-day      must we sing of a Child, whom in unspeakable wise His Father begat      before all times, and whom, within time, a glorious mother brought      forth.)        Int[errogatio].        Quis est iste puer quem tam magnis praeconiis dignum vociferatis?      Dicite nobis ut collaudatores esse possimus. (Who is this Child whom      ye proclaim worthy of so great laudations? Tell us that we also may      praise Him.)        Resp[onsio].        Hic enim est quem praesagus et electus symmista Dei ad terram      venturum praevidens longe ante praenotavit, sicque praedixit. (This      is He whose coming to earth the prophetic and chosen initiate into      the mysteries of God foresaw and pointed out long before, and thus      foretold.)\"    Here followed at once the Introit for the third Mass of Christmas Day,  \"Puer natus est nobis, et filius datus est nobis, &c. (Unto us a child is  born, unto us a son is given.)\" The question and answer were no doubt  sung by different choirs.{2}    One can well imagine that this might develop into a regular little drama.  As a matter of fact, however, it was from an Easter trope in the same  manuscript, the \"Quem quaeritis,\" a dialogue between the three Maries and  the angel at the sepulchre, that the liturgical drama sprang. The trope  became very popular, and was gradually elaborated into a short symbolic  drama, and its popularity led to the composition of similar pieces for  Christmas and Ascensiontide. Here is the Christmas trope from a St. Gall  manuscript:--        \"_On the Nativity of the Lord at Mass let there be ready two deacons      having on dalmatics, behind the altar, saying_:        Quem quaeritis in praesepe, pastores, dicite? (Whom seek ye in the      manger, say, ye shepherds?) |124|        _Let two cantors in the choir answer_:        Salvatorem Christum Dominum, infantem pannis involutum, secundum      sermonem angelicum. (The Saviour, Christ the Lord, a child wrapped in      swaddling clothes, according to the angelic word.)        _And the deacons_:        Adest hic parvulus cum Maria, matre sua, de qua, vaticinando, Isaias      Propheta: ecce virgo concipiet et pariet filium; et nuntiantes dicite      quia natus est. (Present here is the little one with Mary, His      Mother, of whom Isaiah the prophet foretold: Behold, a virgin shall      conceive, and shall bring forth a son; and do ye say and announce      that He is born.)        _Then let the cantor lift up his voice and say_:        Alleluia, alleluia, jam vere scimus Christum natum in terris, de quo      canite, omnes, cum Propheta dicentes: Puer natus est! (Alleluia,      alleluia. Now we know indeed that Christ is born on earth, of whom      sing ye all, saying with the Prophet: Unto us a child is born.)\"{3}    The dramatic character of this is very marked. A comparison with later  liturgical plays suggests that the two deacons in their broad vestments  were meant to represent the midwives mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel  of St. James, and the cantors the shepherds.    A development from this trope, apparently, was the \"Office of the  Shepherds,\" which probably took shape in the eleventh century, though it  is first given in a Rouen manuscript of the thirteenth. It must have been  an impressive ceremony as performed in the great cathedral, dimly lit  with candles, and full of mysterious black recesses and hints of  infinity. Behind the high altar a _praesepe_ or \"crib\" was prepared, with  an image of the Virgin. After the \"Te Deum\" had been sung five canons or  their vicars, clad in albs and amices, entered by the great door of the  choir, and proceeded towards the apse. These were the shepherds. Suddenly  from high above them came a clear boy's voice: \"Fear not, behold I bring  you good tidings of great joy,\" and the rest of the angelic message. The  \"multitude of the heavenly host\" was represented by other boys stationed  probably |125| in the triforium galleries, who broke out into the  exultant \"Gloria in excelsis.\" Singing a hymn, \"Pax in terris nunciatur,\"  the shepherds advanced towards the crib where two priests--the  midwives--awaited them. These addressed to the shepherds the question  \"Whom seek ye in the manger?\" and then came the rest of the \"Quem  quaeritis\" which we already know, a hymn to the Virgin being sung while  the shepherds adored the Infant. Mass followed immediately, the little  drama being merely a prelude.{4}    More important than this Office of the Shepherds is an Epiphany play  called by various names, \"Stella,\" \"Tres Reges,\" \"Magi,\" or \"Herodes,\"  and found in different forms at Limoges, Rouen, Laon, Compiegne,  Strasburg, Le Mans, Freising in Bavaria, and other places. Mr. E. K.  Chambers suggests that its kernel is a dramatized Offertory. It was a  custom for Christian kings to present gold, frankincense, and myrrh at  the Epiphany--the offering is still made by proxy at the Chapel Royal,  St. James's--and Mr. Chambers takes \"the play to have served as a  substitute for this ceremony, when no king actually regnant was  present.\"{5} Its most essential features were the appearance of the Star  of Bethlehem to the Magi, and their offering of the mystic gifts. The  star, bright with candles, hung from the roof of the church, and was  sometimes made to move.    In the Rouen version of the play it is ordered that on the day of the  Epiphany, Terce having been sung, three clerics, robed as kings, shall  come from the east, north, and south, and meet before the altar, with  their servants bearing the offerings of the Magi. The king from the east,  pointing to the star with his stick, exclaims:--        \"Stella fulgore nimio rutilat. (The star glows with exceeding      brightness.)\"    The second monarch answers:        \"Quae regem regum natum demonstrat. (Which shows the birth of the      King of Kings.)\" |126|    And the third:        \"Quem venturum olim prophetiae signaverant. (To whose coming the      prophecies of old had pointed.)\"    Then the Magi kiss one another and together sing:        \"Eamus ergo et inquiramus eum, offerentes ei munera: aurum, thus, et      myrrham. (Let us therefore go and seek Him, offering unto Him gifts:      gold, frankincense, and myrrh.)\"    Antiphons are sung, a procession is formed, and the Magi go to a certain  altar above which an image of the Virgin has been placed with a lighted  star before it. Two priests in dalmatics--apparently the  midwives--standing on either side of the altar, inquire who the Magi are,  and receiving their answer, draw aside a curtain and bid them approach to  worship the"]]]
