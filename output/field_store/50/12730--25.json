Do Thou destine for me, O my God, what becometh the greatness of Thy  majesty, and assist me, by Thy strengthening grace, so to teach Thy Cause  that the dead may speed out of their sepulchers, and rush forth towards  Thee, trusting wholly in Thee, and fixing their gaze upon the orient of  Thy Cause, and the dawning-place of Thy Revelation.    Thou, verily, art the Most Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and...\"      Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, O Thou  Who hast become manifest in the Greatest Name, whereby the pearls of  wisdom and utterance have appeared from the shells of the great sea of Thy  knowledge, and the heavens of divine revelation have been adorned with the  light of the appearance of the sun of Thy countenance.    I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected among  Thy creatures and Thy testimony was fulfilled amidst Thy servants, to  strengthen Thy people in that whereby the face of the Cause will radiate  in Thy dominion, the standards of Thy power will be planted among Thy  servants, and the banners of Thy guidance will be raised throughout Thy  dominions.    O my Lord! Thou beholdest them clinging to the rope of Thy grace and  holding fast unto the hem of the mantle of Thy beneficence. Ordain for  them that which may draw them nearer unto Thee, and withhold them from all  else save Thee.    I beg of Thee, O Thou King of existence and Protector of the seen and the  unseen, to make whosoever arises to serve Thy Cause as a sea moving by Thy  desire, as one ablaze with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, shining from the  horizon of the heaven of Thy will. Verily, Thou art the mighty One, Whom  neither the power of all the world nor the strength of nations can weaken.  There is no God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the Protector, the  Self-Subsistent.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O God, Who art the Author of all Manifestations,...\"      O God, Who art the Author of all Manifestations, the Source of all  Sources, the Fountainhead of all Revelations, and the Wellspring of all  Lights! I testify that by Thy Name the heaven of understanding hath been  adorned, and the ocean of utterance hath surged, and the dispensations of  Thy providence have been promulgated unto the followers of all religions.    I beseech Thee so to enrich me as to dispense with all save Thee, and be  made independent of anyone except Thyself. Rain down, then, upon me out of  the clouds of Thy bounty that which shall profit me in every world of Thy  worlds. Assist me, then, through Thy strengthening grace, so to serve Thy  Cause amidst Thy servants that I may show forth what will cause me to be  remembered as long as Thine own kingdom endureth and Thy dominion will  last.    This is Thy servant, O my Lord, who with his whole being hath turned unto  the horizon of Thy bounty, and the ocean of Thy grace, and the heaven of  Thy gifts. Do with me then as becometh Thy majesty, and Thy glory, and Thy  bounteousness, and Thy grace.    Thou, in truth, art the God of strength and power, Who art meet to answer  them that pray Thee. There is no God save Thee, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O my God, aid Thou Thy servant to raise up...\"      O my God, aid Thou Thy servant to raise up the Word, and to refute what is  vain and false, to establish the truth, to spread the sacred verses  abroad, reveal the splendors, and make the morning's light to dawn in the  hearts of the righteous.    Thou art, verily, the Generous, the Forgiving.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, my God! Aid Thou Thy trusted servants...\"      O God, my God! Aid Thou Thy trusted servants to have loving and tender  hearts. Help them to spread, amongst all the nations of the earth, the  light of guidance that cometh from the Company on high. Verily, Thou art  the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Subduing, the Ever-Giving.  Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Gentle, the Tender, the Most Bountiful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in...\"      Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in lowliness, humbling myself before  Thy commandments, submitting to Thy sovereignty, trembling at the might of  Thy dominion, fleeing from Thy wrath, entreating Thy grace, relying upon  Thy forgiveness, shaking with awe at Thy fury. I implore Thee with a  throbbing heart, with streaming tears and a yearning soul, and in complete  detachment from all things, to make Thy lovers as rays of light across Thy  realms, and to aid Thy chosen servants to exalt Thy Word, that their faces  may turn beauteous and bright with splendor, that their hearts may be  filled with mysteries, and that every soul may lay down its burden of sin.  Guard them then from the aggressor, from him who hath become a shameless  and blasphemous doer of wrong.    Verily, Thy lovers thirst, O my Lord; lead them to the wellspring of  bounty and grace. Verily, they hunger; send down unto them Thy heavenly  table. Verily, they are naked; robe them in the garments of learning and  knowledge.    Heroes are they, O my Lord, lead them to the field of battle. Guides are  they, make them to speak out with arguments and proofs. Ministering  servants are they, cause them to pass round the cup that brimmeth with the  wine of certitude. O my God, make them to be songsters that carol in fair  gardens, make them lions that couch in the thickets, whales that plunge in  the vasty deep.    Verily, Thou art He of abounding grace. There is none other God save Thee,  the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ever-Bestowing.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          PRAYERS FOR TEACHING FROM THE TABLETS OF THE DIVINE PLAN        REVEALED TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: \"O Thou  incomparable God! O Thou Lord of...\"      O Thou incomparable God! O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! These souls are Thy  heavenly army. Assist them and, with the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse,  make them victorious, so that each one of them may become like unto a  regiment and conquer these countries through the love of God and the  illumination of divine teachings.    O God! Be Thou their supporter and their helper, and in the wilderness,  the mountain, the valley, the forests, the prairies and the seas, be Thou  their confidant--so that they may cry out through the power of the Kingdom  and the breath of the Holy Spirit.    Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the Omnipotent, and Thou art  the Wise, the Hearing and the Seeing.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        REVEALED TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: \"O God, my God!  Thou seest me enraptured...\"      Whoever sets out on a teaching journey to any place, let him recite this  prayer day and night during his travels in foreign lands.    O God, my God! Thou seest me enraptured and attracted toward Thy glorious  kingdom, enkindled with the fire of Thy love amongst mankind, a herald of  Thy kingdom in these vast and spacious lands, severed from aught else save  Thee, relying on Thee, abandoning rest and comfort, remote from my native  home, a wanderer in these regions, a stranger fallen upon the ground,  humble before Thine exalted Threshold, submissive toward the heaven of  Thine omnipotent glory, supplicating Thee in the dead of night and at the  break of dawn, entreating and invoking Thee at morn and at eventide to  graciously aid me to serve Thy Cause, to spread abroad Thy Teachings and  to exalt Thy Word throughout the East and the West.    O Lord! Strengthen my back, enable me to serve Thee with the utmost  endeavor, and leave me not to myself, lonely and helpless in these  regions.    O Lord! Grant me communion with Thee in my loneliness, and be my companion  in these foreign lands.    Verily, Thou art the Confirmer of whomsoever Thou willest in that which  Thou desirest, and, verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        REVEALED TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: \"O God! O God!  Thou seest my weakness,...\"      Let whosoever travels to different parts to teach, peruse over mountain,  desert, land and sea this supplication.    O God! O God! Thou seest my weakness, lowliness and humility before Thy  creatures; nevertheless, I have trusted in Thee and have arisen in the  promotion of Thy teachings among Thy strong servants, relying on Thy power  and might.    O Lord! I am a broken-winged bird and desire to soar in Thy limitless  space. How is it possible for me to do this save through Thy providence  and grace, Thy confirmation and assistance.    O Lord! Have pity on my weakness, and strengthen me with Thy power. O  Lord! Have pity on my impotence, and assist me with Thy might and majesty.    O Lord! Should the breath of the Holy Spirit confirm the weakest of  creatures, he would attain all to which he aspireth and would possess  anything he desireth. Indeed, Thou hast assisted Thy servants in the past  and, though they were the weakest of Thy creatures, the lowliest of Thy  servants and the most insignificant of those who lived upon the earth,  through Thy sanction and potency they took precedence over the most  glorious of Thy people and the most noble of mankind. Whereas formerly  they were as moths, they became as royal falcons, and whereas before they  were as brooks, they became as seas, through Thy bestowal and Thy mercy.  They became, through Thy most great favor, stars shining on the horizon of  guidance, birds singing in the rose gardens of immortality, lions roaring  in the forests of knowledge and wisdom, and whales swimming in the oceans  of life.    Verily, Thou art the Clement, the Powerful, the Mighty, and the Most  Merciful of the merciful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        REVEALED TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA: \"O God, my God!
