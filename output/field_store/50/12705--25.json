Many patients drop them from their lives  entirely. Many others in whom dementia is not indicated, or in whose  cases it is indefinitely delayed, can come to an intellectual  realization that all these things are fantasies, and do not represent  reality; that despite their continued, frequent, or occasional demands  upon feeling life, they can be consistently ignored. These psychopathic  individuals may act as they would if the delusions never came henceforth  to their consciousness, and so be enabled to live a comparatively normal  life.      THE OBSESSED PATIENT    A patient who is suffering from obsessions must carry out certain  abnormal actions, or be wretched. She cannot do otherwise. It is as  though she were forced by some outside agent, though the forcing is  actually from within. When the nurse realizes this, and the more  essential fact--that many patients, who have not true obsessions, yet  have a tendency toward obsessed ways of thinking and doing--when she  comprehends it almost as she would if she were the victim, then she is  ready to help the patient by gently making the action impossible, and at  the same time diverting attention.      THE MIND A PREY TO FALSE ASSOCIATIONS    Sometimes a nurse reminds a patient of some one in the past who has  complicated her life in an unhappy way, so she distrusts or dreads her  or is made constantly uncomfortable in her presence. In such a case, if  the nurse reports her patient as resistive, or fearful or cringing, or  distrustful, she is really misrepresenting her; for under another's care  that patient may show an entirely opposite reaction.    The nurse can only sense the strength of the influence of heredity and  environment and habit of thought, which would give the explanation of  many things in her patient's attitude. Nor can she realize just what  shade of meaning certain phrases and words have for her charge. To the  nervously overwrought person the most innocent reference--father,  sister, wife, home--may bring concepts that are unbearable. The  association of the word may make for deep unhappiness, of which the  nurse knows nothing. But she _can_ learn that all these things _do_  influence attitude, can appreciate the difficulty of her patient's  effort at adjustment, and do all in her power to make that adjustment  possible. If the patient is reasonable she can appeal to her reason. If  she is too sick for that, the nurse can use happy suggestions. If the  mind is deluded and obsessed she can use firm kindness. She can learn  what loss of privileges will affect the rude and unco-operative patient,  and may be allowed to try that. She can sometimes help the patient to  self-control by making her realize that after each outburst she will be  constructively ignored.    But the point we wish to make is this: There are some sick reactions  which the nurse, if she recognizes as such, can help the patient to  transform into wholesome ones. At the very least the wise nurse can  learn to simplify her own difficulties by accepting the unpleasant  patient as possibly the result of her illness, and refusing to allow her  trying attitude to get on her nerves. The patient may be reacting  normally to the stimulus her untrained and toxic brain received. And  when the nurse can see into the other's mental workings, get her point  of view, she is ready to give fundamental help.          CHAPTER XII    THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE NURSE      The mind can be as definitely developed and strengthened as the body.  The man who has suffered for years an organic disease will never have  the same force as he who has never been seriously ill; but his  constitution can be built up and made as efficient as possible within  its limitations. Many a man or woman who has an organic heart disorder,  through treatment and the proper exercises gradually increased, can very  often approximate through many years the output of a normally strong  person. The individual weakened by a tuberculous infection can  frequently, by following a prescribed regimen for a time, by wise,  scientific diet and rest treatment and the help of the out-of-doors,  then by carefully increased physical activity, finally live the useful,  average life. But it takes scientific care to evolve the weak body into  a strong one; and in some cases, at best, it can never stand the same  strain that the uninjured one carries with ease. However, even damaged  bodies can be made very productive within their limited spheres. Also  the naturally perfect physique can quickly become unfit through neglect  or infections or misuse.    In the same way, and just as definitely, can the mind be developed and  strengthened. Some are by nature keen, alert, brilliant. They may  develop into masterfulness; or they, too, may degenerate, through abuse,  or from the effect of body infections, into uselessness. The germ-plasm  has foreordained some individuals to psychic disorders; but training and  mode of life can modify many of these defects. And the average mind,  like the average physical organs, can be made more efficient through  partaking of the proper mental food, through careful training and wise  use.    No more urgent necessity faces the professional woman than this of  training her mind to its highest productiveness. Argument is not needed  to convince intelligent people today that the accomplishment of life  depends upon mentality.    Let us look into the very A, B, C's of mind development, and as nurses  undertake to equip ourselves to master our profession from the ground  up. The first essential is ability to think clearly.    _Steps to Clear Thinking_:    1. Accurate perception, with attention to the thing that reason chooses.    2. Association of ideas.    3. Concentration, acquired by the help of emotion and will.    4. Emotional equilibrium, which refuses to allow feeling to obscure  judgment by leading reason astray.    5. Self-correction.    6. Automatic habits, which free the mind of all unnecessary crowding.      ACCURACY OF PERCEPTION    The beginning of learning is perception. Keen, accurate perception at  the time of first introduction of a new fact or thought, and the linking  up of that new material with something already in consciousness, insures  in the normal mind the ability to remember and use that fact or thought  again. The things casually perceived and not definitely tied up with  something else are soon forgotten by the conscious mind.    You pass a florist shop where a score of different flowers and plants  are displayed. If your thoughts are intently on your errand you may  glance in, see flowers, color, perhaps a riot of colors only--and  beauty; and you feel a glow of pleasure from the sight. But a moment  later you cannot name the blooms in the window. Perhaps roses come to  mind because you have very special feeling for them; or carnations, or  sweet peas. But the window as a whole you perceive only as flowers, and  color, and beauty. You cannot describe it in detail, for you gave it  only passive attention.    But if you went to that window to know its contents; to find out what  the florist had in his shop, because you are very interested in all  flowers and plants, then you can tell minutely what is there. You had a  purpose in perceiving the window; your will held attention upon each  object in turn; and your love of flowers (an emotion) eased the effort  of volition when it might have tired.    Perception, then, is of three kinds: passive, incited by interest, and  directed by will. And the perception which is the basis of accurate  knowledge is one of keen interest, or of will, or of interest plus will.      TRAINING PERCEPTION    The nurse who demands of herself that she perceive accurately paves the  way for accurate, deft service in her profession. There are constant  means at hand for training in the art. Suppose you try to get so  definite a picture of each ward or room you enter, in a swift but  attentive examination of its furnishings and their locations, and of the  patients, that you can reproduce it to yourself or a friend some days  later.    You come into a large ward, with a row of beds on either side of the  door, and a wide central space between. How many beds in each row? There  is a table at the far end of the room, opposite the door, and a nurse in  white is writing there. Why does she wear white? What is her name? To  your right is a closet-like room opening from the ward. That is a  medicine-room, you are told. How many windows has the ward? You glance  from bed to bed with a rapid passing in review of the patients. Which  ones seem to you very ill? There is a large white screen about one. You  are told that when treatments are given the screen is put there, or that  when a patient is dying the bed is screened. You look for the  ventilators, and see how many are open and how they work. You see a  room-thermometer, and ask at what temperature it is kept. The nurse  explains that a certain degree is ordered, and that, so far as possible,  the ventilators are operated to insure that.    If your attention has followed all these details with careful, accurate  perception; if you have grasped them clearly, one by one, at the time,  you will be able to answer quickly next day when some one asks how many  patients the wards accommodate, and how many beds are vacant. You can  describe the lighting and ventilation, the room temperature, etc. And  later on you will quickly see to it that a screen is properly placed  when you know treatments are to be given.      ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS    After the first few years of life practically nothing enters  consciousness that cannot by some likeness or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#19)"],[1,"upon his work at once, working out the most  poetic effort of his life in marble and stone, among the masons'  chippings and the dust and blaze of the public street. At the same time  he designed, tho it does not seem sure whether he lived long enough to  execute, a new facade for the Cathedral, replacing Arnolfo's old statues  by something better.    Of the Campanile itself it is difficult to speak in ordinary words. The  enrichments of the surface, which is covered by beautiful groups set in  a graceful framework of marble, with scarcely a flat or unadorned spot  from top to bottom, have been ever since the admiration of artists and  of the world. But we confess, for our own part, that it is the structure  itself that affords us that soft ecstasy of contemplation, sense of a  perfection before which the mind stops short, silenced and filled with  the completeness of beauty unbroken, which Art so seldom gives, tho  Nature often attains it by the simplest means, through the exquisite  perfection of a flower or a stretch of summer sky.    Just as we have looked at a sunset we look at Giotto's tower, poised far  above in the blue air, in all the wonderful dawns and moonlights of  Italy, swift darkness shadowing its white glory at the tinkle of the Ave  Maria, and a golden glow of sunbeams accompanying the mid-day angelus.  Between the solemn antiquity of the old baptistery and the historical  gloom of the great cathedral, it stands like the lily--if not, rather,  like the great angel himself hailing her who was blest among women, and  keeping up that lovely salutation, musical and sweet as its own beauty,  for century after century, day after day. Giotto made not only the  design, but even, Vasari assures us, worked at the groups and  \"bassi-relievi\" of these \"stories in marble, in which are depicted the  beginning of all the arts.\" ...    Filippo of Ser Brunellescho of the Lapi, which is, according to  Florentine use, his somewhat cumbrous name, or Brunelleschi for short,  as custom permitted him to be called, was the son of a notary, who as  notaries do, hoped and expected his boy to follow in his steps and  succeed to his practise. But, like other sons doomed their fathers' soul  to cross, Filippo took to those \"figuretti\" in bronze which were so  captivating to the taste of the time, and preferred rather to be a  goldsmith, to hang upon the skirts of art, than to work in the paternal  office. He was, as Vasari insinuates, small, puny, and ugly, but full of  dauntless and daring energy as well as genius. From his gold and silver  work, the \"carvings\" which old Bartoluccio had been so glad to escape,  and from his \"figuretti,\" the ambitious lad took to architectural  drawing, of which, according to Vasari, he was one of the first  amateurs, making \"portraits\" of the Cathedral and baptistery, of the  Palazzo Pubblico, and the other chief buildings of the city. He was so  eloquent a talker that a worthy citizen declared of him that he seemed  \"a new St. Paul;\" and in his thoughts he was continually busy planning  or imagining something skilful and difficult.    The idea of completing the Cathedral by adding to it a cupola worthy of  its magnificent size and proportions seems to have been in the young  man's head before the Signoria or the city took any action in the  matter. Arnolfo's designs are said to have been lost, and all the young  Filippo could do was to study the picture in the Spanish chapel of Santa  Maria Novella, where the cathedral was depicted according to Arnolfo's  intention; and this proof to the usefulness of architectural  backgrounds, no doubt, moved him to those pictures of building which he  was fond of making.    After his failure in the competition with Ghiberti for the baptistery  gates, Filippo went to Rome, accompanied by Donato. Here the two friends  lived and studied together for some time, one giving himself to  sculpture, the other to architecture. Brunelleschi, according to Vasari,  made this a period of very severe study. He examined all the remains of  ancient buildings with the keenest care; studying the foundations and  the strength of the walls, and the way in which such a prodigious load  as the great dome, which already he saw in his mind's eye, could best be  supported.    So profound were his researches that he was called the treasure-hunter  by those who saw him coming and going through the streets of Rome, a  title so far justified that he is said in one instance to have actually  found an ancient earthenware jar full of old coins. While engaged in  these studies, his money failing him, he worked for a jeweller according  to the robust practise of the time, and after making ornaments and  setting gems all day, set to work on his buildings, round and square,  octagons, basilicas, arches, colosseums, and amphitheaters, perfecting  himself in the principles of his art.    In 1407 he returned to Florence, and then there began a series of  negotiations between the artist and the city, to which there seemed at  first as if no end could come. They met, and met again, assemblies of  architects, of city authorities, of competitors less hopeful and less  eager than himself. His whole heart, it is evident, was set upon the  business. Hearing Donatello at one of these assemblies mention the  cathedral at Orvieto, which he had visited on his way from Rome,  Filippo, having his mantle and his hood on, without saying a word to  anyone, set straight off from the Piazza on foot, and got as far as  Cortona, from whence he returned with various pen-and-ink drawings  before Donato or any one else had found out that he was away.    Thus the small, keen, determined, ugly artist, swift and sudden as  lightning, struck through all the hesitations, the consultations, the  maunderings, the doubts, and the delays of the two authorities who had  the matter in hand, the Signoria and the Operai, as who should say the  working committee, and who made a hundred difficulties and shook their  wise heads, and considered one foolish and futile plan after another  with true burgher hesitation and wariness.    At last, in 1420, an assembly of competitors was held in Florence, and a  great many plans put forth, one of which was to support the proposed  vault by a great central pillar, while another advised that the space to  be covered should be filled with soil mixed with money, upon which the  dome might be built, and which the people would gladly remove without  expense afterward for the sake of the farthings! An expedient most droll  in its simplicity. Brunelleschi, impatient of so much folly, went off to  Rome, it is said, in the middle of these discussions, disgusted by the  absurd ignorance which was thus put in competition with his careful  study and long labor. Finally the appointment was conceded to him.    The greatest difficulty with which he had to contend was a strike of his  workmen, of whom, however, there being no trades' unions in those days,  the imperious master made short work. And thus, day by day, the great  dome swelled out over the shining marble walls and rose against the  beautiful Italian sky. Nothing like it had been seen before by living  eyes. The solemn grandeur of the Pantheon at Rome was indeed known to  many, and San Giovanni[34] was in some sort an imitation of that; but  the immense structure of the cupola, so justly poised, springing with  such majestic grace from the familiar walls to which it gave new  dignity, flattered the pride of the Florentines as something unique,  besides delighting the eyes and imagination of so beauty-loving a race.    With that veiled and subtle pride which takes the shape of pious fear,  some even pretended to tremble, lest it should be supposed to be too  near an emulation of the blue vault above, and that Florence was  competing with heaven; others, with the delightful magniloquence of the  time, declared that the hills around the city were scarcely higher than  the beautiful Duomo; and Vasari himself has a doubt that the heavens  were envious, so persistent were the storms amid which the cupola arose.    Yet there it stands to this day, firm and splendid, uninjured by  celestial envy, more harmonious than St. Peter's, the crown of the  beautiful city. Its measurements and size and the secrets of its  formation we do not pretend to set forth; the reader will find them in  every guide-book. But the keen, impetuous, rapid figure of the  architect, impatient, and justly impatient, of all rivalry, the murmurs  and comments of the workmen; the troubled minds of the city authorities,  not knowing how to hold their ground between that gnome of majestic  genius who had fathomed all the secrets of construction and built a  hundred Duomos in his mind, while they were pottering over the  preliminaries of one; have all the interest of life for us.    Through the calm fields of art he goes like a whirlwind, keen, certain,  unfailing in his aim, unsparing in means, carried forward by such an  impulse of will and self-confidence that nothing can withstand him. Sure  of his own powers, as he was when he carved in secret the crucifix which  was to cover poor Donatello with confusion, he saw before him, over his  carvings, as he worked for the Roman goldsmith, the floating vision of  the great dome he was to build--and so built it, all opposition  notwithstanding, clearing out of his way with the almost contemptuous  impatience of that knowledge which has no doubt of itself, the competing  architects.          GHIBERTI'S GATES[35]    BY CHARLES YRIARTE      The Baptistery is the most ancient building in Florence. If not of pagan  origin it dates from the earliest ages of Christianity. It was coated  with marble of different colors by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1293, while in  the sixteenth century Agnolo Gaddi designed the lantern; but long before  Arnolfo's time it had been employed as a Christian place of worship,  being used as a cathedral up to 1128,"]]]
