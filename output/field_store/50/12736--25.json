[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#19)"],[1," is why Christ said, \"The Father is in the Son,\" meaning that  the Sun is visible and manifest in this mirror.    The Holy Spirit is the Bounty of God which becomes visible and evident in  the Reality of Christ. The Sonship station is the heart of Christ, and the  Holy Spirit is the station of the spirit of Christ. Hence it has become  certain and proved that the Essence of Divinity is absolutely unique and  has no equal, no likeness, no equivalent.    This is the signification of the Three Persons of the Trinity. If it were  otherwise, the foundations of the Religion of God would rest upon an  illogical proposition which the mind could never conceive, and how can the  mind be forced to believe a thing which it cannot conceive? A thing cannot  be grasped by the intelligence except when it is clothed in an  intelligible form; otherwise, it is but an effort of the imagination.    It has now become clear, from this explanation, what is the meaning of the  Three Persons of the Trinity. The Oneness of God is also proved.          28: EXPLANATION OF VERSE FIVE, CHAPTER SEVENTEEN, OF THE GOSPEL OF ST.  JOHN      \"And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the glory  which I had with Thee before the world was.\"(98)    There are two kinds of priorities: one is essential and is not preceded by  a cause, but its existence is in itself, as, for example, the sun has  light in itself, for its shining is not dependent on the light of other  stars. This is called an essential light. But the light of the moon is  received from the sun, for the moon is dependent on the sun for its light;  therefore, the sun, with regard to light, is the cause, and the moon  becomes the effect. The former is the ancient, the precedent, the  antecedent, while the latter is the preceded and the last.    The second sort of preexistence is the preexistence of time, and that has  no beginning. The Word of God is sanctified from time.(99) The past, the  present, the future, all, in relation to God, are equal. Yesterday, today,  tomorrow do not exist in the sun.    In the same way there is a priority with regard to glory--that is to say,  the most glorious precedes the glorious. Therefore, the Reality of Christ,  Who is the Word of God, with regard to essence, attributes and glory,  certainly precedes the creatures. Before appearing in the human form, the  Word of God was in the utmost sanctity and glory, existing in perfect  beauty and splendor in the height of its magnificence. When through the  wisdom of God the Most High it shone from the heights of glory in the  world of the body, the Word of God, through this body, became oppressed,  so that it fell into the hands of the Jews, and became the captive of the  tyrannical and ignorant, and at last was crucified. That is why He  addressed God, saying: \"Free Me from the bonds of the world of the body,  and liberate Me from this cage, so that I may ascend to the heights of  honor and glory, and attain unto the former grandeur and might which  existed before the bodily world, that I may rejoice in the eternal world  and may ascend to the original abode, the placeless world, the invisible  kingdom.\"    It is thus that you see even in the kingdom of this world--that is to say,  in the realm of souls and countries--that the glory and the grandeur of  Christ appeared in this earth after His ascension. When in the world of  the body He was subject to the contempt and jeers of the weakest nation of  the world, the Jews, who thought it fitting to set a crown of thorns upon  His sacred head. But after His ascension the bejeweled crowns of all the  kings were humbled and bowed before the crown of thorns.    Behold the glory that the Word of God attained even in this world!          29: EXPLANATION OF VERSE TWENTY-TWO, CHAPTER FIFTEEN, OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS      Question.--In verse 22 of chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians it is written: \"For  as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" What is  the meaning of these words?    Answer.--Know that there are two natures in man: the physical nature and  the spiritual nature. The physical nature is inherited from Adam, and the  spiritual nature is inherited from the Reality of the Word of God, which  is the spirituality of Christ. The physical nature is born of Adam, but  the spiritual nature is born from the bounty of the Holy Spirit. The first  is the source of all imperfection; the second is the source of all  perfection.    The Christ sacrificed Himself so that men might be freed from the  imperfections of the physical nature and might become possessed of the  virtues of the spiritual nature. This spiritual nature, which came into  existence through the bounty of the Divine Reality, is the union of all  perfections and appears through the breath of the Holy Spirit. It is the  divine perfections; it is light, spirituality, guidance, exaltation, high  aspiration, justice, love, grace, kindness to all, philanthropy, the  essence of life. It is the reflection of the splendor of the Sun of  Reality.    The Christ is the central point of the Holy Spirit: He is born of the Holy  Spirit; He is raised up by the Holy Spirit; He is the descendant of the  Holy Spirit--that is to say, that the Reality of Christ does not descend  from Adam; no, it is born of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, this verse in  Corinthians, \"As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made  alive,\" means, according to this terminology, that Adam(100) is the father  of man--that is to say, He is the cause of the physical life of mankind;  His was the physical fatherhood. He is a living soul, but He is not the  giver of spiritual life, whereas Christ is the cause of the spiritual life  of man, and with regard to the spirit, His was the spiritual fatherhood.  Adam is a living soul; Christ is a quickening spirit.    This physical world of man is subject to the power of the lusts, and sin  is the consequence of this power of the lusts, for it is not subject to  the laws of justice and holiness. The body of man is a captive of nature;  it will act in accordance with whatever nature orders. It is, therefore,  certain that sins such as anger, jealousy, dispute, covetousness, avarice,  ignorance, prejudice, hatred, pride and tyranny exist in the physical  world. All these brutal qualities exist in the nature of man. A man who  has not had a spiritual education is a brute. Like the savages of Africa,  whose actions, habits and morals are purely sensual, they act according to  the demands of nature to such a degree that they rend and eat one another.  Thus it is evident that the physical world of man is a world of sin. In  this physical world man is not distinguished from the animal.    All sin comes from the demands of nature, and these demands, which arise  from the physical qualities, are not sins with respect to the animals,  while for man they are sin. The animal is the source of imperfections,  such as anger, sensuality, jealousy, avarice, cruelty, pride: all these  defects are found in animals but do not constitute sins. But in man they  are sins.    Adam is the cause of man's physical life; but the Reality of Christ--that  is to say, the Word of God--is the cause of spiritual life. It is \"a  quickening spirit,\" meaning that all the imperfections which come from the  requirements of the physical life of man are transformed into human  perfections by the teachings and education of that spirit. Therefore,  Christ was a quickening spirit, and the cause of life in all mankind.    Adam was the cause of physical life, and as the physical world of man is  the world of imperfections, and imperfections are the equivalent of death,  Paul compared the physical imperfections to death.    But the mass of the Christians believe that, as Adam ate of the forbidden  tree, He sinned in that He disobeyed, and that the disastrous consequences  of this disobedience have been transmitted as a heritage and have remained  among His descendants. Hence Adam became the cause of the death of  humanity. This explanation is unreasonable and evidently wrong, for it  means that all men, even the Prophets and the Messengers of God, without  committing any sin or fault, but simply because they are the posterity of  Adam, have become without reason guilty sinners, and until the day of the  sacrifice of Christ were held captive in hell in painful torment. This is  far from the justice of God. If Adam was a sinner, what is the sin of  Abraham? What is the fault of Isaac, or of Joseph? Of what is Moses  guilty?    But Christ, Who is the Word of God, sacrificed Himself. This has two  meanings, an apparent and an esoteric meaning. The outward meaning is  this: Christ's intention was to represent and promote a Cause which was to  educate the human world, to quicken the children of Adam, and to enlighten  all mankind; and since to represent such a great Cause--a Cause which was  antagonistic to all the people of the world and all the nations and  kingdoms--meant that He would be killed and crucified, so Christ in  proclaiming His mission sacrificed His life. He regarded the cross as a  throne, the wound as a balm, the poison as honey and sugar. He arose to  teach and educate men, and so He sacrificed Himself to give the spirit of  life. He perished in body so as to quicken others by the spirit.    The second meaning of sacrifice is this: Christ was like a seed, and this  seed sacrificed its own form so that the tree might grow and develop.  Although the form of the seed was destroyed, its reality became apparent  in perfect majesty and beauty in the form of a tree.    The position of Christ was that of absolute perfection; He made His divine  perfections shine like the sun upon all believing souls, and the bounties  of the light shone and radiated in the reality of men. This is why He  says: \"I am the bread which descended from heaven; whosoever shall eat of  this bread will not die\"("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#19)"],[1,". Its storm-clouds are fast  gathering on the horizon. Tempestuous winds will assail you from every  side. The Light of the Covenant will be obscured through my departure.  These mighty blasts, this wintry desolation, shall however pass away. The  dormant seed will burst into fresh activity. It shall put forth its buds,  shall reveal, in mighty institutions, its leaves and blossoms. The vernal  showers which the tender mercies of my heavenly Father will cause to  descend upon you will enable this tender plant to spread out its branches  to regions far beyond the confines of your native land. And finally the  steadily mounting sun of His Revelation, shining in its meridian splendor,  will enable this mighty Tree of His Faith to yield, in the fullness of  time and on your soil, its golden fruit.    The implications of such a parting message could not long remain  unrevealed to 'Abdu'l-Baha's initiated disciples. No sooner had He  concluded His long and arduous journey across the American and European  continents than the tremendous happenings to which He had alluded began to  be made manifest. A conflict, such as He had predicted, severed for a time  all means of communication with those on whom He had come to place such  implicit trust and from whom He was expecting so much in return. The  wintry desolation, with all its havoc and carnage, pursued during four  years its relentless course, while He, repairing to the quiet solitude of  His residence in the close neighborhood of Baha'u'llah's hallowed shrine,  continued to communicate His thoughts and wishes to those whom He had left  behind and on whom He had conferred the unique tokens of His favor. In the  immortal Tablets which, in the long hours of His communion with His  dearly-beloved friends He was moved to reveal, He unfolded to their eyes  His conception of their spiritual destiny, His Plan for the mission He  wished them to undertake. The seeds His hands had sown He was now watering  with that same care, that same love and patience, which had characterized  His previous endeavors whilst He was laboring in their midst.    The clarion call which 'Abdu'l-Baha had raised was the signal for an  outburst of renewed activity which, alike in the motives it inspired and  the forces it set in motion, America had scarcely experienced. Lending an  unprecedented impetus to the work which the enterprising ambassadors of  the Message of Baha'u'llah had initiated in distant lands, this mighty  movement has continued to spread until the present day, has gathered  momentum as it extended its ramifications over the surface of the globe,  and will continue to accelerate its march until the last wishes of its  original Promoter are completely fulfilled.    Forsaking home, kindred, friends and position a handful of men and women,  fired with a zeal and confidence which no human agency can kindle, arose  to carry out the mandate which 'Abdu'l-Baha had issued. Sailing northward  as far as Alaska, pushing on to the West Indies, penetrating the South  American continent to the banks of the Amazon and across the Andes to the  southernmost ends of the Argentine Republic, pressing on westward into the  island of Tahiti and beyond it to the Australian continent and still  beyond it as far as New Zealand and Tasmania, these intrepid heralds of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah have succeeded by their very acts in setting to  the present generation of their fellow-believers throughout the East an  example which they may well emulate. Headed by their illustrious  representative, who ever since the call of 'Abdu'l-Baha was raised has  been twice round the world and is still, with marvellous courage and  fortitude, enriching the matchless record of her services, these men and  women have been instrumental in extending, to a degree as yet unsurpassed  in Baha'i history, the sway of Baha'u'llah's universal dominion. In the  face of almost insurmountable obstacles they have succeeded in most of the  countries through which they have passed or in which they have resided, in  proclaiming the teachings of their Faith, in circulating its literature,  in defending its cause, in laying the basis of its institutions and in  reinforcing the number of its declared supporters. It would be impossible  for me to unfold in this short compass the tale of such heroic actions.  Nor can any tribute of mine do justice to the spirit which has enabled  these standard-bearers of the Religion of God to win such laurels and to  confer such distinction on the generation to which they belong.    The Cause of Baha'u'llah had by that time encircled the globe. Its light,  born in darkest Persia, had been carried successively to the European, the  African and the American continents, and was now penetrating the heart of  Australia, encompassing thereby the whole earth with a girdle of shining  glory. The share which such worthy, such stout-hearted, disciples have had  in brightening the last days of 'Abdu'l-Baha's earthly life He alone has  truly recognized and can sufficiently estimate. The unique and eternal  significance of such accomplishments the labors of the rising generation  will assuredly reveal, their memory its works will befittingly preserve  and extol. How deep a satisfaction 'Abdu'l-Baha must have felt, while  conscious of the approaching hour of His departure, as He witnessed the  first fruits of the international services of these heroes of His Father's  Faith! To their keeping He had committed a great and goodly heritage. In  the twilight of His earthly life He could rest content in the serene  assurance that such able hands could be relied upon to preserve its  integrity and exalt its virtue.    The passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, so sudden in the circumstances which caused  it, so dramatic in its consequences, could neither impede the operation of  such a dynamic force nor obscure its purpose. Those fervid appeals,  embodied in the Will and Testament of a departed Master, could not but  confirm its aim, define its character and reinforce the promise of its  ultimate success.    Out of the pangs of anguish which His bereaved followers have suffered,  amid the heat and dust which the attacks launched by a sleepless enemy had  precipitated, the Administration of Baha'u'llah's invincible Faith was  born. The potent energies released through the ascension of the Center of  His Covenant crystallized into this supreme, this infallible Organ for the  accomplishment of a Divine Purpose. The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha  unveiled its character, reaffirmed its basis, supplemented its principles,  asserted its indispensability, and enumerated its chief institutions. With  that self-same spontaneity which had characterized her response to the  Message proclaimed by Baha'u'llah America had now arisen to espouse the  cause of the Administration which the Will and Testament of His Son had  unmistakably established. It was given to her, and to her alone, in the  turbulent years following the revelation of so momentous a Document, to  become the fearless champion of that Administration, the pivot of its  new-born institutions and the leading promoter of its influence. To their  Persian brethren, who in the heroic age of the Faith had won the crown of  martyrdom, the American believers, forerunners of its golden age, were now  worthily succeeding, bearing in their turn the palm of a hard-won victory.  The unbroken record of their illustrious deeds had established beyond the  shadow of a doubt their preponderating share in shaping the destinies of  their Faith. In a world writhing with pain and declining into chaos this  community--the vanguard of the liberating forces of Baha'u'llah--succeeded  in the years following 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing in raising high above the  institutions established by its sister communities in East and West what  may well constitute the chief pillar of that future House--a House which  posterity will regard as the last refuge of a tottering civilization.    In the prosecution of their task neither the whisperings of the  treacherous nor the virulent attacks of their avowed enemies were allowed  to deflect them from their high purpose or to undermine their faith in the  sublimity of their calling. The agitation provoked by him who in his  incessant and sordid pursuit of earthly riches would have, but for  'Abdu'l-Baha's warning, sullied the fair name of their Faith, had left  them in the main undisturbed. Schooled by tribulation and secure within  the stronghold of their fast evolving institutions they scorned his  insinuations and by their unswerving loyalty were able to shatter his  hopes. They refused to allow any consideration of the admitted prestige  and past services of his father and of his associates to weaken their  determination to ignore entirely the person whom 'Abdu'l-Baha had so  emphatically condemned. The veiled attacks with which a handful of deluded  enthusiasts subsequently sought in the pages of their periodical to check  the growth and blight the prospects of an infant Administration had  likewise failed to achieve their purpose. The attitude which a besotted  woman later on assumed, her ludicrous assertions, her boldness in flouting  the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha and in challenging its authenticity and her  attempts to subvert its principles were again powerless to produce the  slightest breach in the ranks of its valiant upholders. The treacherous  schemes which the ambition of a perfidious and still more recent enemy has  devised and through which he is still striving to deface 'Abdu'l-Baha's  noble handiwork and corrupt its administrative principles are being once  more completely frustrated. These intermittent and abortive attempts on  the part of its assailants to force the surrender of the newly built  stronghold of the Faith its defenders have from the very beginning utterly  disdained. No matter how fierce the assaults of the enemy or skillful his  stratagem they have"]]]
