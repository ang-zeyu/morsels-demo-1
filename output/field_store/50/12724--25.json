The wily Zidoc, however, was not to be so easily thwarted. Uttering a  magic word, he caused the room to be filled with darkness, and in the  cover of this darkness he transformed himself instantly into a black cat  exactly like the learned cat, while Serponel changed himself into a  white dog exactly like the learned dog. At the same moment he caused the  locked door to fly open.    \"Now,\" thought he, \"I will cause the cat to follow the wrong white dog,  and the dog to follow the wrong cat; we shall thus separate the animals,  and when we have lured them far away from each other, Serponel and I  will resume our true forms, and destroy these meddlesome creatures.\"    When the darkness cleared, the hearts of the true animals fell for fear  lest the sorcerer's ruse be successful; but they met the challenge  readily, and instead of fleeing, stood their ground; the true dog  battling with the false dog, the real cat with the false cat. Never was  such a hullaballoo heard in Fairyland. Then, seeing that he was in  danger of being badly scratched, Zidoe brought on another darkness, the  floor of the castle shook, a noise as of thunder roared and rattled  through the room. When the darkness ended, both the enchanters had been  separated and the cats were confused, the real dog was chasing the real  cat, thinking that he was following Zidoc, while Serponel, who had been  the false white dog, was pursuing Zidoc, who had been the false black  cat! Down the stairs, over the terraces and the gardens ran the true  dog, pursuing the true cat, while indoors, up and down through the rooms  and over the furniture, raced the false animals.    The poor cat, thinking he was being pursued by the wrong dog, grew short  of breath, and, hearing the snapping at his heels, ran up a convenient  tree. Hardly had he reached a point above the dog's jaws when a voice  said:--    \"Why, my pupils, my pupils! What a way to behave! Stop your quarreling  this instant!\"    The animals turned to look, and saw their master, the old enchanter. He  had been worried by their long absence and had gone forth to look for  them. Thus, at the same moment that the poor dog saw that he had been  pursuing his friend, the cat saw that he had been escaping from his  comrade.    Suddenly a noise from the castle arrested their attention, and on  looking up, all saw through the windows the false dog pursuing the false  cat down the hall of state.    Now, if you remember the first part of this story, you will recall that  Zidoc quarreled with the old enchanter over the right spell for  destroying castles. A triumphant smile shone on the lips of the old  teacher; he stretched forth his hand toward the castle and uttered a  magic word.    There was a roar as of twenty thousand cataracts, and in the twinkling  of an eye, the castle collapsed in a cloud of dust, burying the two  wicked magicians in its ruins.    \"There, I told him so!\" said the old enchanter.    When the dog and the cat had recovered from the events of the day, the  three friends began their journey back to the palace of the enchanted  King. He came to the castle gate to meet them, for Zidoc's overthrow had  broken the spell which had so oddly disfigured him. Through the open  doors, a splendid banquet could be seen waiting, and the sound of music  was heard.    So the old enchanter gave his arm to the Fairy Jocapa, the Prince gave  his to the white dog, and the cat followed all by himself. Then came the  host of rejoicing courtiers.    When the festival was over, the enchanter and the wonderful animals went  back, loaded with royal gifts, to their own little house and lived  happily there to a good old age.             THE SHEPHERD OF CLOUDS    [Illustration: A man and two elves watching clouds pour through a large  gate.]      Once upon a time a young husband and wife named Giles and Phyllida lived  in a cottage in the heart of a great plain. League upon league, the rich  land fell away to the west, there to end at a wall of high mountains  into whose fastnesses no one had ever ventured. Yet the mountains were  very beautiful. In the cold of a clear winter's day, the snowy summits  and rust-colored pinnacles shone bright and near at hand; in the spring,  fogs hid them, and lay like gray mantles upon the lower slopes. Midway  in the mountain wall, a wide chasm marked the entrance to a deep, gloomy  valley, out of which a roaring mountain torrent hurried, to lose itself  in the plain below. And because somewhere in the heart of this dark  valley storms were brewed, whose dark clouds, laden with lightning and  hail, poured from between the crags of the valley out over the land,  this valley was known as the Valley of Thunder. According to an old  legend, out of this valley a king should one day come to rule over the  people of the plain.    Giles and Phyllida kept house by themselves. They had two cows, one red  and white, the other black and white, a flock of hens, some hives of  bees, a white horse, a dog, and a cat.  All day long Phyllida worked  happily at the household tasks, baking the sweet white bread and marking  the fresh golden butter into square pats, while Giles went out to work  in the waving grain; and Phyllida, watching from a window, would see the  sun flash on the uplifted blade of her husband's scythe.    One day Phyllida said to Giles:--    \"I have made a dress for the youngest child of our cousins, Jack and  Jill, and this morning I shall saddle the white horse and ride over to  their cottage. Perhaps I may stay with them for a few days. You will  find a fresh baking of bread and a meat-pie in the larder. Good-bye,  Giles; I'll soon be home again.\"    So Giles answered, \"Good-bye,\" and away rode Phyllida on the white  horse.    A few days passed, and Giles, wandering here and there through the quiet  house, felt very lonely indeed. Finally he could stand it no longer, and  said to himself, \"Phyllida must be on her way home now; I shall walk  down the highway and meet her.\"    So he turned all the animals loose in the fields, and putting a few  slices of bread and cheese in his pockets, set forth upon the road.  Leagues ahead of him stood the mysterious mountains rising palely  through the haze of the midsummer afternoon. A pale violet light fell on  their distant precipices, and the snow in the rifts upon their sides  appeared of the purest and loveliest white. Gusts of wind hurrying from  the distant summits swept the great plain, and the fields of ripening  wheat bent before them and rustled harshly.    Suddenly, down the throat of the Thunder Valley, Giles saw a river of  lightning fall, and from far away came a low murmur of thunder. Then,  faster and faster, a storm poured down the chasm like a flood, drowning  out the light of the sun, stilling the songs of the little birds, and  turning to the sky the pale underside of the leaves of the roadside  trees. A darkness as of night itself covered the land. Rain began to  fall in great spattering drops.  Now, by the glare of the lightning,  Giles would see the endless fields, drenched and waving in the rain; now  the Thunder Valley itself, covered with a floor of onrushing cloud  unfolding, turning, and sinking in continuous and multitudinous  activity.    Night came on amid the storm, and a flash of lightning revealed to Giles  that he had lost his way. Hoping to find a shelter or some friendly  cottage, however, he plunged on; but the road became worse and worse,  and he was again and again forced to wade brooks flooded by the tempest.  At length his steps led him into a pine wood, and there in the thickest  part he found a little shelter, and fell asleep.    When he woke, numb, cramped, and cold, he found to his horror that in  the night and darkness he had blundered on into the Valley of Thunder,  into which no living soul had ever before advanced. Worst of all, he  could not find the way by which he had entered, for high crags rose on  every side and held him prisoner. Presently, to his amazement, he beheld  a narrow flight of steps cut in the solid rock of the mountainside. Up  these steps climbed Giles, and as he mounted higher, the stairs began to  twist and turn amid the crags and pinnacles. At the end of an hour's  ascent, he found himself at a turn from which the Thunder Valley, the  chasm through which it opened into the plain, and the wide plain itself,  could all be seen.    Giles lingered there a while, trying to see his own cottage, or perhaps  Phyllida on her white horse; but he could see neither one nor the other.  So he began to climb again. All day long he climbed and climbed and  climbed. Twilight fell. The circle of the sun dropped below the level  horizon of the distant fields. One still golden star hung on the fringe  of the sun-glow. The stairs began to widen, and presently Giles found  himself at the summit of the mountain. Before his eyes lay a little  level field surrounded by strange crags and pinnacles, looming tall and  black against the fast-appearing stars, and as Giles rubbed his eyes in  wonder, lights shone here and there in the sides of the towering rocks,  even as lights shine in the windows of a village when you see it from  afar.    Giles rubbed his eyes again. Lights? What could they mean? Presently a  great door, cut in the side of a towering mass of stone, opened with a  burst of light, and toward Giles there hurried the two strangest  creatures whom he had ever seen. These were two elves, alike as two peas  and each about three feet tall. Instead of having ears much like other  elves, however, the first one had ears like great curved cornucopias,  which projected almost a foot on each side of his enormous round head,  while the other, whose ears were quite natural, had but one huge eye in  the centre of his forehead.    Without saying a single word, these strange "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#19)"],[1,"out, and ushered in the hideous reptilian age, when monstrous  saurians, footed, paddled, and winged, were the lords of this lower  world. All the great mountain chains were at this time slumbering  beneath the ocean. The city of New York was sure of its site; but huge  dinotheria wallowed in the mire where now stand the palaces of Paris,  London, and Vienna.    At length the morning breaks upon the last day of creation, and the fiat  goes forth that the proud waves of the Pacific, which have so long  washed the table-lands of Guiana and Brazil, shall be stayed. Far away  toward the setting sun the white surf beats in long lines of foam  against a low, winding archipelago--the western outline of the coming  continent. Fierce is the fight for the mastery between sea and land,  between the denuding power of the waves and the volcanic forces  underneath. But slowly--very slowly, yet surely--rises the long chain of  islands by a double process; the submarine crust of the earth is  cooling, and the rocks are folded up as it shrivels, while the molten  material within, pressed out through the crevices, overflows and helps  to build up the sea-defiant wall. A man's life would be too short to  count even the centuries consumed in this operation. The coast of Peru  has risen eighty feet since it felt the tread of Pizarro: supposing the  Andes to have risen at this rate uniformly and without interruption,  seventy thousand years must have elapsed before they reached their  present altitude. But when we consider that, in fact, it was an  intermittent movement--alternate upheaval and subsidence--we must add an  unknown number of millennia.    Three times the Andes sank hundreds of feet beneath the ocean level, and  again were slowly brought up to their present height. The suns of  uncounted ages have risen and set upon these sculptured forms, though  geologically recent, casting the same line of shadows century after  century. A long succession of brute races roamed over the mountains and  plains of South America, and died out ages ere man was created. In those  pre-Adamite times, long before the Incas ruled, the mastodon and  megatherium, the horse and the tapir, dwelt in the high valley of Quito;  yet all these passed away before the arrival of the aborigines: the wild  horses now feeding on the pampas of Buenos Ayres were imported from  Europe three hundred and thirty-three years ago.[50]    [Footnote 50: At Paita, the most western point of South America, there  is a raised beach three hundred feet high. The basal slate and sandstone  rocks, dipping S. of E., are covered by conglomerate, sand, and a  gypseous formation, containing shells of living species. Additional to  those described by D'Orbigny we found here _Cerithium laeviuscula_,  _Ostrea gallus_, and _Ampullina Ortoni_, as determined by W.M. Gabb,  Esq., of Philadelphia. Darwin found shells in Chile 1300 feet above the  sea, covered with marine mud. President Loomis, of Lewisburg University,  Pa., informs the writer, that in 1853, after nearly a day's ride from  Iquique, he came to a former sea-beach. \"It furnished abundant specimens  of _Patellae_ and other shells, still perfect, and identical with others  that I had that morning obtained at Iquique with the living animal  inhabiting them.\" This beach is elevated 2500 feet above the Pacific.  The same observer says that near Potosi there is one uninterrupted mass  of lava, having a columnar structure, not less than one hundred miles in  length, fifty miles wide, and eight hundred feet thick. It overlies a  bed of saliferous sandstone which has been worked for salt. Fifty feet  within a mine, and in the undisturbed rock which forms its roof, the  doctor found fragments of dicotyledonous trees with the bark on,  undecomposed, uncharred, and fibrous.]    And now the Andes[51] stand complete in their present gigantic  proportions, one of the grandest and most symmetrical mountain chains in  the world. Starting from the Land of Fire, it stretches northward and  mounts upward until it enters the Isthmus of Panama, where it bows  gracefully to either ocean, but soon resumes, under another name, its  former majesty, and loses its magnificence only where the trappers chase  the fur-bearing animals over the Arctic plains. Nowhere else does Nature  present such a continuous and lofty chain of mountains, unbroken for  eight thousand miles, save where it is rent asunder by the Magellanic  Straits, and proudly tossing up a thousand pinnacles into the region of  eternal snow. Nowhere in the Old World do we see a single well-defined  mountain chain, only a broad belt of mountainous country traversing the  heart of the continent.    [Footnote 51: The name Andes is often derived from _anta_, an old  Peruvian word signifying metal. But Humboldt says: \"There are no means  of interpreting it by connecting it with any signification or idea; if  such connection exist, it is buried in the obscurity of the past.\"  According to Col. Tod, the northern Hindoos apply the name Andes to the  Himalayan Mountains.]    The moment the Andes arose, the great continental valley of the Amazon  was sketched out and moulded in its lap. The tidal waves of the Atlantic  were dashing against the Cordilleras, and a legion of rivulets were  busily plowing up the sides into deep ravines; the sediment produced by  this incessant wear and tear was carried eastward, and spread out  stratum by stratum, till the shallow sea between the Andes and the  islands of Guiana and Brazil was filled up with sand and clay. Huge  glaciers (thinks Agassiz), afterward descending, moved over the inclined  plane, and ground the loose rock to powder.[52] Eddies and currents,  throwing up sand-banks as they do now, gradually defined the limits of  the tributary streams, and directed them into one main trunk, which  worked for itself a wide, deep bed, capable of containing its  accumulated flood. Then and thus was created the Amazon.    [Footnote 52: On this point see Chapter XVII.]    In South America Nature has framed her works on a gigantic scale. Where  else combined do we see such a series of towering mountains, such a  volume of river-water, and such wide-spreading plains? We have no proper  conception of Andine grandeur till we learn that the top of the tallest  mountain in North America is nearly a mile beneath the untrodden dome of  Chimborazo; nor any just view of the vast dimensions of the Amazonian  Valley till we find that all the United States could be packed in it  without touching its boundaries; nor any adequate idea of the Amazon  itself till we ascertain that it drains a million square miles more than  the Mississippi.    South America is a triangular continent, with its axis, the Andes, not  central, as in Europe, but lying on its extreme western edge, and in  harmony with the well-known law that the highest mountains and the  grandest volcanoes face the broadest ocean. The highlands of Brazil and  Guiana have neither volcanic nor snow-clad peaks.[53] Like all the dry  land which first appeared, these primitive mountains on the Atlantic  border trend east and west. The result of this position is a triple  river system--the Orinoco, Amazon, and La Plata, draining three immense  plains--the llanos of Venezuela, the sylvas of Brazil, and the pampas of  the Argentine Republic. The continuity and extent of these vast  depressions are more remarkable even than the height and length of the  mountain chains.[54]    [Footnote 53: \"The interior plateau of Brazil (says Dr. Lund) is  composed of horizontal strata of the transition period, which are  nowhere covered with the secondary or tertiary formations.\" The highest  point in Brazil is 5755 feet. Darwin speaks of \"some ancient submarine  volcanic rocks (in the province of La Plata) worth mentioning, from  their rarity on this eastern side of the continent.\" With the exception  of the coast of Venezuela, the eastern system is little exposed to  earthquakes.]    [Footnote 54: These three plains constitute four fifths of all South  America east of the Andes. The west slope of the Ecuadorian Andes is  about 275 feet per mile; on the east it is 125 feet.]    Such are the characteristic features of South America; they are not  repeated in any other continent.[55] Not one feature could be changed  without destroying those peculiarities of soil and climate which so  remarkably distinguish South America. Its position on the equator places  it in the path of the vapory trade winds, which continually sweep over  it westward till they strike the Andes, which, like a great condenser,  roll a thousand streams eastward again to feed the mighty Amazon. So  effectual is that barrier, not a drop of moisture passes it, and the  trade wind is not felt again on the Pacific till you are one hundred  and fifty miles from the coast. Were the Andes on the Atlantic side,  South America would be turned into a vast Sahara. As it is, the interest  which attaches to this continent, save a few relics of the Incas, is  exclusively that of pure nature. Nowhere does Nature affect us more  deeply with the feeling of her grandeur; nowhere does she exhibit wilder  freaks or more startling contrasts; nowhere do we find such a theatre  for the free development of vegetable and animal life.    [Footnote 55: There is, however, a striking coincidence between the  mountain and river systems of the northern and southern continents of  this hemisphere. Thus,    The Andes represent the Rocky Mountains,   \"  Highland of Guiana represent the Canadian Mountains.   \"     \"        Brazil     \"         Appalachian  \"   \"              Amazon     \"         Saskatchewan.   \"              La Plata   \"         Mississippi.   \"              Orinoco    \"         Mackenzie.    ]    The long and lofty chain of the Andes is certainly one of the grandest  results of the plications and uplifts of the earth's crust. While the  waves of the Pacific, from Panama to Patagonia,"]]]
