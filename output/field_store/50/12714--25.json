Sometimes she reeled and almost slid at one  of those lightning turns, for the game was to almost unseat her, but  just as she was sliding off Bart would slacken his pace and let her find  a firm seat once more. They wound farther and farther away, and suddenly  Kate cried, terror-stricken: \"Joan! Come back!\"    A tug at the ear of the wolf-dog swung them around; then as they  approached, the fear left the mind of the mother and a new thought came  in its place. She coaxed Joan from Bart--they could play later on, she  promised, to their heart's desire--and led her into the house. Black  Bart followed to the door, but not all their entreaty or scolding could  make him cross the threshold. He merely snarled at Kate, and even Joan's  tugging at his ears could not budge him. He stood canting his head and  watching them wistfully while Kate changed Joan's clothes.    She dressed her as if for a festival, with a blue bonnet that let the  yellow hair curl out from the edges, and a little blue cloak, and shiny  boots incredibly small, and around the bonnet she laid a wreath  of yellow wild flowers. Then she wrote her letter, closed it in an  envelope, and fastened it securely in the pocket of the cloak.    She drew Joan in front of her and held her by both hands.    \"Joan, darling,\" she said, \"munner wants you to go with Bart up through  the mountains. Will you be afraid?\"    A very decided shake of the head answered her, for Joan's eyes were  already over her shoulder looking towards the big dog. And she was a  little sullen at these unnecessary words.    \"It might grow dark,\" she said. \"You wouldn't care?\"    Here Joan became a little dubious, but a whine from Bart seemed to  reassure her.    \"Bart will keep Joan,\" she said.    \"He will. And he'll take you up through the rocks to Daddy Dan.\"    The face of the child grew brilliant.    \"Daddy Dan?\" she whispered.    \"And when you get to him, take this little paper out of your pocket and  give it to him. You won't forget?\"    \"Give the paper to Daddy Dan,\" repeated Joan solemnly.    Kate dropped to her knees and gathered the little close, close,  until Joan cried out, but when she was eased the child reached up an  astonished hand, touched the face of Kate with awe, and then stared at  her finger tips.    A moment later, Joan stood in front of Black Bart, with the head of the  wolf-dog seized firmly between her hands while she frowned intently into  his face.    \"Take Joan to Daddy Dan,\" she ordered.    At the name, the sharp ears pricked; a speaking intelligence grew up in  his eyes.    \"Giddap,\" commanded Joan, when she was in position on the back of Bart.  And she thumped her heels against the furry ribs.    Towards Kate, who stood trembling in the door, Bart cast the departing  favor of a throat-tearing growl, and then shambled across the meadow  with that smooth trot which wears down all other four-footed creatures.  He was already on the far side of the meadow, and beginning the ascent  of the first slope when the glint of the sun on the yellow wild flowers  flashed on the eye of Kate. It had all seemed natural until that moment,  the only possible thing to do, but now she felt suddenly that Joan was  thrown away thought of the darkness which would soon come--remembered  the yellow terror which sometimes gleamed in the eyes of Black Bart  after nightfall.    She cried out, but the wolf-dog kept swiftly on his way. She began to  run, still calling, but rapidly as she went, Black Bart slid steadily  away from her, and when she reached the shoulder of the mountain, she  saw the dark form of Bart with the blue patch above it drifting up the  wall of the opposite ravine.    She knew where they were going now; it was the old cave upon which she  and Dan had come one day in their rides, and Dan had prowled for a long  time through the shadowy recesses.        Chapter XIX. The Venture    From the moment Joan gave the name of Daddy Dan, the wolf-dog kept to  the trail with arrowy straightness. Whatever the limitations of  Bart's rather uncanny intelligence, upon one point he was usually  letter-perfect, and even when a stranger mentioned Dan in the hearing of  the dog it usually brought a whine or at least an anxious look. He hewed  to his line now with that animal sense of direction which men can never  wholly understand. Boulders and trees slipped away on either side of  Joan; now on a descent of the mountain-side he broke into a lope that  set the flowers fluttering on her bonnet; now he prowled up the ravine  beyond, utterly tireless.    He was strictly business. When she slipped a little from her place as he  veered around a rock he did not slow up, as usual, that she might regain  her seat, but switched his head back with a growl that warned her into  position. That surprise was hardly out of her mind when she saw a gay  patch of wild-flowers a little from the line of his direction, and she  tugged at his ear to swing him towards it. A sharp jerk of his head  tossed her hand aside, and again she caught the glint of wild eyes as he  looked back at her. Then she grew grave, puzzled. She trusted Black Bart  with all her heart, as only a child can trust dumb animals, but now she  sensed a change in him. She had guessed at a difference on that night  when Dan came home for the last time; and the same thing seemed to be in  the dog today.    Before she could make up her mind as to what it might be, Black Bart  swung aside up a steep slope, and whisked her into the gloom of a cave.  Into the very heart of the darkness he glided and stopped.    \"Daddy Dan!\" she called.    A faint echo, after a moment, came back to her from the depths of the  cave, making her voice strangely deep. Otherwise, there was no answer.    \"Bart!\" she whispered, suddenly frightened by the last murmur of that  echo, \"Daddy Dan's not here. Go back!\"    She tugged at his ear to turn him, but again that jerk of the head freed  his ear. He caught her by the cloak, crouched close to the floor, and  she found herself all at once sitting on the gravelly floor of the cave  with Bart facing her.    \"Bad Bart!\" she said, scrambling to her feet.    \"Naughty dog!\"    She was still afraid to raise her voice in that awful silence, and in  the dark. When she glanced around her, she made out vague forms through  the dimness that might be the uneven walls of the cave, or might be  strange and awful forms of night.    \"Take me home!\"    A growl that went shuddering down the cave stopped her, and now she saw  that the eyes of Bart glowed green and yellow. Even then she could not  believe that he would harm her, and stretched out a tentative hand. This  time she made out the flash of his teeth as he snarled. He was no longer  the Bart she had played with around the cabin, but a strange wild thing,  and with a scream she darted past him toward the door. Never had those  chubby legs flown so fast, but even as the light from the mouth of the  cave glimmered around her, she heard a crunching on the gravel from  behind, and then a hand, it seemed, caught her cloak and jerked her to a  stop.    She fell sprawling, head over heels, and when she looked up, there sat  Bart upon his haunches above her, growling terribly, and gripping the  end of the cloak. No doubt about it now. Black Bart would have his teeth  in her throat if she made another movement toward the entrance. A city  child would have either gone mad with terror or else made that fatal  struggle to reach the forbidden place, but Joan had learned many things  among the mountains, and among others, she knew the difference between  the tame and the free. The old dappled cow was tame, for instance;  and the Maltese cat, which came too close to Bart the year before and  received a broken back for its carelessness, had been tame; and the  brown horse with the white face and the dreary eyes was tame. They  could be handled, and teased, and petted and bossed about at will. Other  creatures were different. For instance, the scream of the hawk  always made her shrink a little closer to the ground, or else run  helter-skelter for the house, and sometimes, up the gulches, she had  heard the wailing of a mountain lion on the trail, hunting swiftly, and  very hungry. There was even something about the dead eyes of certain  lynxes and coyotes and bobcats which Daddy Dan trapped that made Joan  feel these animals belonged to a world where the authority of man was  only the strength of his hand or his cunning. Not that she phrased  these thoughts in definite words, but Joan was very close to nature, and  therefore her instincts gave her a weird little touch of wisdom in such  matters.    And when she lay there tangled in her cloak and looked up into the  glowing eyes of Bart and heard his snarling roll around her, and pass in  creepy chills up her back, she nearly died of fear, to be sure, but she  lay as still as still, frozen into a part of the rock. Black Bart was  gone, and in his place was a terrible creature which belonged there  among the shadows, for it could see in the night.    Presently the bright eyes disappeared, and now she saw that Bart lay  stretched across the entrance to the cave, where the long shadow was now  creeping down the slope. Inches by inches she ventured to sit up, and  all it brought from Bart was a quick turn of the head and a warning  growl. It meant as plainly as though he had spoken in so many words:  \"Stay where you are and I don't care in the least what you do, but don't  try to cross this entrance if you fear the length of my teeth and the  keenness thereof.\" And she did fear them, very much, for she remembered  the gashes across the back and the terrible rips up the side, of the  dead Maltese cat.    She even took a little heart, after a time. A grownup cannot feel terror  or grief as keenly as a child, but neither does terror or grief pass  away a tithe as fast. She seemed at liberty to roam about in the cave  as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#19)"],[1,"their carouse, and then called for the master and  mistress of the house.    \"'Immediately my mistress came in,' says the valet de chambre, 'one of  the officers who was sitting on the floor got up, and, putting a  revolver to my mistress' temple, shot her dead. The officer was  obviously drunk. The other officers continued to drink and sing, and  they did not pay any great attention to the killing of my mistress. The  officer who shot my mistress then told my master to dig a grave and bury  my mistress. My master and the officer went into the garden, the officer  threatening my master with a pistol. My master was then forced to dig  the grave and to bury my mistress in it. I cannot say for what reason  they killed my mistress. The officer who did it was singing all the  time.'    \"In the evidence before us there are cases tending to show that  aggravated crimes against women were sometimes severely punished. One  witness reports that a young girl who was being pursued by a drunken  soldier at Louvain appealed to a German officer, and that the offender  was then and there shot. Another describes how an officer of the  Thirty-second Regiment of the Line was led out to execution for the  violation of two young girls, but reprieved at the request or with the  consent of the girls' mother. These instances are sufficient to show  that the maltreatment of women was no part of the military scheme of the  invaders, however much it may appear to have been the inevitable result  of the system of terror deliberately adopted in certain regions. Indeed,  so much is avowed. 'I asked the commander why we had been spared,' says  a lady in Louvain, who deposes to having suffered much brutal treatment  during the sack. He said: 'We will not hurt you any more. Stay in  Louvain. All is finished.' It was Saturday, August 29th, and the reign  of terror was over.    \"The Germans used men, women and children of Belgium as screens for  advancing infantry, as is shown in the following: Outside Fort Fleron,  near Liege, men and children were marched in front of the Germans to  prevent the Belgian soldiers from firing. The progress of the Germans  through Mons was marked by many incidents of this character. Thus, on  August 22d, half a dozen Belgian colliers returning from work were  marching in front of some German troops who were pursuing the English,  and in the opinion of the witnesses, they must have been placed there  intentionally. An English officer describes how he caused a barricade to  be erected in a main thoroughfare leading out of Mons, when the Germans,  in order to reach a crossroad in the rear, fetched civilians out of the  houses on each side of the main road and compelled them to hold up white  flags and act as cover.    \"Another British officer who saw this incident is convinced that the  Germans were acting deliberately for the purpose of protecting  themselves from the fire of the British troops. Apart from this  protection, the Germans could not have advanced, as the street was  straight and commanded by the British rifle fire at a range of 700 or  800 yards. Several British soldiers also speak of this incident, and  their story is confirmed by a Flemish witness in a side street.\"    The French Government also appointed a commission, headed by M. Georges  Payelle. This body made an investigation of outrages committed by German  officers and soldiers in Northern France. Its report showed conditions  that outstripped in horror the war tactics of savages. It makes the  following accusations:    \"In Rebais, two English cavalrymen who were surprised and wounded in  this commune were finished off with gunshots by the Germans when they  were dismounted and when one of them had thrown up his hands, showing  thus that he was unarmed.    \"In the department of the Marne, as everywhere else, the German troops  gave themselves up to general pillage, which was carried out always  under similar conditions and with the complicity of their leaders. The  Communes of Heiltz-le-Maurupt, Suippes, Marfaux, Fromentieres and  Esternay suffered especially in this way. Everything which the invader  could carry off from the houses was placed on motor lorries and  vehicles. At Suippes, in particular, they carried off in this way a  quantity of different objects, among these sewing machines and toys. A  great many villages, as well as important country towns, were burned  without any reason whatever. Without doubt, these crimes were committed  by order, as German detachments arrived in the neighborhood with their  torches, their grenades, and their usual outfit for arson.    \"At Marfaux nineteen private houses were burned. Of the Commune of  Glannes practically nothing remains. At Somme-Tourbe the entire village  has been destroyed, with the exception of the Mairie, the church and two  private buildings. At Auve nearly the whole town has been destroyed. At  Etrepy sixty-three families out of seventy are homeless. At Huiron all  of the houses, with the exception of five have been burned. At  Sermaize-les-Bains only about forty houses out of 900 remain. At  Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty houses out of thirty-three are in ruins.    \"At Suippes, the big market town which has been practically burned out,  German soldiers carrying straw and cans of petrol have been seen in the  streets. While the mayor's house was burning, six sentinels with fixed  bayonets were under orders to forbid anyone to approach and to prevent  any help being given.    \"All this destruction by arson, which only represents a small proportion  of the acts of the same kind in the Department of Seine-et-Marne, was  accomplished without the least tendency to rebellion or the smallest act  of resistance being recorded against the inhabitants of the localities  which are today more or less completely destroyed. In some villages the  Germans, before setting fire to them made one of their soldiers fire a  shot from his rifle so as to be able to pretend afterward that the  civilian population had attacked them, an allegation which is all the  more absurd since at the time when the enemy arrived, the only  inhabitants left were old men, sick persons, or people absolutely  without any means of aggression.

A FIGHT IN A CLOUD OF GAS    The Germans had sent over gas and in this spot it lingered. Then the    infantry advanced and here, amid the British wire entanglements, the    foes meet. Both sides in gas masks, they struggle amid the \"poisonous    vapor, and when the bayonet fails they fight, like the pair in the    foreground, to bring death by tearing away their opponent's mask.      \"Numerous crimes against the person have also been committed. In the  majority of the communes hostages have been taken away; many of them  have not returned. At Sermaize-les-Bains, the Germans carried off about  one hundred and fifty people, some of whom were decked out with helmets  and coats and compelled, thus equipped, to mount guard over the bridges.    \"At Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty men and forty-five women and children  were obliged to leave with a detachment. One of the men--a certain Emile  Pierre--has not returned nor sent any news of himself. At Corfelix, M.  Jacqet, who was carried off on the 7th of September with eleven of his  fellow-citizens, was found five hundred meters from the village with a  bullet in his head.    \"At Champuis, the cure, his maid-servant, and four other inhabitants who  were taken away on the same day as the hostages of Corfelix had not  returned at the time of our visit to the place.    \"At the same place an old man of seventy, named Jacquemin, was tied down  in his bed by an officer and left in this state without food for three  days. He died a little time after. At Vert-la-Gravelle a farm hand was  killed. He was struck on the head with a bottle and his chest was run  through with a lance. The garde champetre Brulefer of le Gault-la-Foret  was murdered at Maclaunay, where he had been taken by the Germans. His  body was found with his head shattered and a wound on his chest.    \"At Champguyon, a commune which has been fired, a certain Verdier was  killed in his father-in-law's house. The latter was not present at the  execution, but he heard a shot and next day an officer said to him, 'Son  shot. He is under the ruins.' In spite of the search made the body has  not been found among them. It must have been consumed in the fire.    \"At Sermaize, the roadmaker, Brocard, was placed among a number of  hostages. Just at the moment when he was being arrested with his son,  his wife and his daughter-in-law in a state of panic rushed to throw  themselves into the Saulx. The old man was able to free himself for a  moment and ran in all haste after them and made several attempts to save  them, but the Germans dragged him away pitilessly, leaving the two  wretched women struggling in the river. When Brocard and his son were  restored to liberty, four days afterward, and found the bodies, they  discovered that their wives had both received bullet wounds in the head.    \"At Triaucourt the Germans gave themselves up to the worst excesses.  Angered doubtless by the remark which an officer had addressed to a  soldier, against whom a young girl of nineteen, Mlle. Helene Proces, had  made complaint of on account of the indecent treatment to which she had  been subjected, they burned the village and made a systematic massacre  of the inhabitants. They began by setting fire to the house of an  inoffensive householder, M. Jules Gand, and by shooting this unfortunate  man as he was leaving his house to escape the flames.
