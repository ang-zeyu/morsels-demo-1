Put it in the saucer, and let us watch the larva crawl about.    [Illustration]    It never comes entirely out of the case, you see. It holds on to it with  the hinder part of its body.    Its little black head is hard, but its body is soft, and that is why it  does not like to expose itself to hungry larvae that might be living in  the water.    May says she wants to see the whole larva.    Suppose we carefully break away the little sand case.    No, indeed, little Nell, we are not going to hurt the larva; we are only  going to open its house.    [Illustration]    There, the larva is outside now, and you can see what a tender, pale  little thing it is.    It does not like to have its soft body exposed.    See! it is already gathering little bits of sand together.    It seems to be sticking them fast to its body.    It is really binding them together by a saliva-like substance from its  mouth.    It draws out little glistening threads that harden into silk as soon as  they touch the water.    Queer saliva you think.    But the caddice larva does not find it queer. It is used to saliva that  hardens into silk.    Yes, that is the way the larva of the aphis lion and of the ant lion  made their cocoons. They spun out silk in this manner.    The caddice larva makes its house of silk and sand and also lines it  with a beautiful covering of fine silk.    Yes, May, it papers its walls with silk.    You see it did not hurt the caddice larva to take away its house; it  immediately went to work to build another.    Why not pull it out, instead of breaking its house to pieces?    Because if it had been pulled hard enough to come out, it might have  been torn to pieces, it is such a tender little thing, and it holds fast  so tightly.    So the best way to remove it safely is to break its case bit by bit from  around it.    It does no harm to break its case if one is careful. It will soon build  another.    Yes, this larva has no distinct thorax. It is like the larvae of the  dobson, the aphis lion, and the ant lion in that respect.    [Illustration]    See! John has found one whose tube is made of quite large stones as  compared with this tube of fine sand that we have broken open.    Some caddice larvae build houses of wood instead of stone. They stick  little twigs together, and some use little pieces of leaves.    Others again use tiny snail shells which, as you can imagine, make very  pretty cases.    [Illustration]    Our little caddice has made a neat little house of fine sand grains very  nicely put together.    Some others make much rougher houses.    You will be apt to find the caddice larvae in any brook and in some  ponds, and I hope you will always look for them.    Notice the tracery in the soft mud of the brook.    Those lines that look as though some one had been ornamenting the bottom  of the brook are made by our caddice larvae.    [Illustration]    They drag their cases along and thus make these lines.    Sometimes such lines are made by the little fresh-water snails; but you  can always find the decorator by following along the lines he makes.    What, May? How is the delicate larva able to cling to the case tightly  enough to pull it along? If you look at it very carefully, you will find  a pair of tiny hooks at the tail end by which it can hold on to the silk  lining; and some caddice larvae have hard points on their backs which  help them to hold fast.    The caddice larvae are carnivorous; that is, they eat animal food.    Yes, May, their food is usually the larvae of other insects, but you will  be glad to know that some of them eat plants too.    They eat the larvae of the May flies when they can find them and no doubt  they build these strong cases about themselves to prevent the May fly  larvae from returning the compliment.    Frank has found some empty cases, yes, and some that are closed at both  ends.    Now, let us look at this one closed at both ends. What do you suppose is  in it?    We will open just one of these closed cases.    There! It is a pupa! Yes, Nell, a very pretty doll is this.    [Illustration]    It has a thorax, you see, and an abdomen. Its long antennae lie close to  its body as do its little wing pads.    Yes, the caddice larva grows and moults in the usual way. It keeps  adding to its house as it grows longer. Finally, it closes the end of  its little tube and lies quite still.    You know what happens next. Its wormlike form divides into thorax and  abdomen. Legs and wings appear, attached to the thorax. In short, it is  no longer a wormlike creature.    Finally, it comes forth from its case. It never goes into it again.    [Illustration]    It does not need to, for now it is a dainty little nun, with a long,  tan-colored cloak. Its cloak, of course, is its wings folded down about  its body. Like the fairy May flies it has no mouth and eats nothing in  the adult form.    It looks like a dainty brown moth as it flutters about the bushes and  goes flying up and down the brook.    You will always find these little brown-cloaked figures flitting about  the brooks, where the caddice larvae live.    You see the caddice undergoes a complete metamorphosis.    No, it does not belong to the Neuroptera.    Examine its wings very carefully. Look at them through the magnifying  glass, and you will see they are clothed with hairs.    So these are the hair wings.    The name of the order to which they belong is Trichoptera, from  _pteron_, a wing, and _thrix_, a hair.    Sometime you must take a caddice larva from its house and put it in a  saucer of water with fine bits of mica, which you know is another name  for the isinglass that makes the little windows in our stoves.    If you are fortunate, your caddice will build for itself a little glass  house, through whose walls you can look and see what is going on inside.

I replied that so far as their private belongings were concerned, they  were welcome to keep them, as I never allowed the personal property of  my prisoners to be tampered with in my presence.[47] But I told them  that the letters were a different matter, and that I could not allow  them to reach their destination--unless they were directed to a bonfire!    There was nothing left for the officers to do, except to agree to my  terms then and there; for had they hesitated even for a moment, I should  certainly have stormed the station.    But they wisely surrendered.    On our arrival at the station, we were all filled with wonder at the  splendid entrenchments the English had constructed from bales of cotton,  blankets and post-bags. These entrenchments had been so effectual that  the enemy's loss was only twenty-seven killed and wounded--a remarkably  small number, when it is remembered that we took two hundred of them  prisoners.    I had expected that our booty would be large, and my expectations were  more than realized. To begin with, there were the bales of clothing that  the English had used as entrenchments. Then there were hundreds of cases  of necessaries of every description. Of ammunition, also, there was no  lack, and amongst it there were projectiles for the Naval guns, with  which Lord Roberts had intended to bombard Pretoria.    Some of the burghers attempted to lift these gigantic shells, but it  took more than one man to move them.    I read in the newspapers afterwards that I had inflicted a loss of three  quarters of a million sterling on the English Government--let that give  the extent of my capture.    But at that moment we did not realize how much harm we had done to them.  We had little time for anything which did not directly forward our  cause. I was, however, very sorry that I could not carry away with me  the blankets and boots which we found in large quantities, for they  would have been most valuable for winter use. But there was no time for  this, as the English held the railway and could at any moment bring up  reinforcements from Bloemfontein, from Kroonstad, or from Pretoria. So,  as I could not take the booty away with me, I was obliged to consign it  to the flames.    But before I did this I gave the burghers permission to open the  post-bags, and to take what they liked out of them. For in these bags  there were useful articles of every description, such as underclothing,  stockings, cigars and cigarettes.    Very soon every one was busy with the post-bags--as if each burgher had  been suddenly transformed into a most zealous postmaster!    Whilst my men were thus pleasantly occupied, two prisoners asked me if I  would not allow them also to open the post-bags, and to investigate  their contents. I told them to take just what they fancied, for  everything that was left would be burnt.    It was a very amusing sight to see the soldiers thus robbing their own  mail! They had such a large choice that they soon became too dainty to  consider even a plum-pudding worth looking at!    Although I had ordered my men to wreck the bridges both to the north and  to the south of us, I still did not feel secure--any delay on our part  was fraught with danger, and the sooner we were off the better.    But before we could start, I had to find some method of removing the  ammunition which I wished to take with me. Since I possessed no waggons  available for this purpose, my only course was to order my burghers to  carry away the quantity required. But my burghers were busily engaged in  looting.    Those who have had any experience of our commandos will not need to be  told that it was a difficult task to get any men to help me in the work.  I did succeed, however, in dragging a few of the burghers away from the  post-bags. But the spirit of loot was upon them, and I was almost  powerless. Even when I had induced a burgher to work, he was off to the  post-bags again the instant my back was turned, and I had to go and hunt  him up, or else to find some other man to do the work. Yet, in spite of  this, I succeeded in removing the gun and Lee-Metford ammunition. We  carried away some six hundred cases of this ammunition,[48] and hid it  at a spot about three hundred paces from the station.    When the sun set, the burghers were again on the march. But what a  curious spectacle they presented!    Each man had loaded his horse so heavily with goods that there was no  room for himself on the saddle; he had, therefore, to walk, and lead his  horse by the bridle. And how could it be otherwise? For the burghers had  come from a shop where no money was demanded, and none paid!    But the most amusing thing of all was to watch the \"Tommies\" when I gave  them the order to march. The poor Veldtcornet, who was entrusted with  the task of conducting them to our camp, had his hands full when he  tried to get them away from the booty; and when at last he succeeded,  the soldiers carried such enormous loads, that one could almost fancy  that every man of them was going to open a store. But they could not  carry such burdens for long, and soon they were obliged to diminish  their bulk, thus leaving a trail of parcels to mark the road they had  taken!    And now it was time for the fire to do its work, and I ordered fifteen  men to set the great heap of booty alight. The flames burst out  everywhere simultaneously--our task was completed.    In an instant we had mounted our horses and were off.    When we had covered fifteen hundred paces, we heard the explosion of the  first shells, and wheeled round to view the conflagration. The night was  very dark, and this rendered the sight that met our eyes still more  imposing. It was the most beautiful display of fireworks that I have  ever seen.    One could hear, between the thunder of the big bombs, the dull report of  exploding cordite. Meanwhile the dark sky was resplendent with the red  glow of the flames.    I must now give some description of General Froneman's engagement to the  north of Rhenosterriviersbrug.[49]    The firing we had heard before sunrise came from the English outposts,  as they were retreating to their camp. The burghers and the English had  both seized positions on small hills and in abandoned Kaffir kraals.[50]    Although the English had very good positions, and out-numbered our men  by two to one, they found it impossible to hold out against our fire.  They had no guns, whilst we possessed, as the reader knows, two Krupps  and a quick-firing gun, which latter had the same effect as a  Maxim-Nordenfeldt. Thus the enemy was forced to surrender; and five  hundred of them were taken prisoner, among whom were Captain Wyndham  Knight and several other officers. Their casualties amounted to the  large total of one hundred and seventy killed and wounded, Colonel  Douglas being one of the killed.    Commandant Steenekamp had also met with success, for he had captured the  English camp at Vredefortweg Station, and taken thirty prisoners,  without firing a shot.    Thus we had made eight hundred of the enemy our prisoners, and destroyed  an enormous amount of their ammunition, and this with scarcely any loss  on our side. At Roodewal only two of my men had been wounded, whilst  General Froneman had lost but one killed--a burgher named Myringen--and  two slightly wounded.    It had been a wonderful day for us--a day not easily forgotten.    We were deeply thankful for our success. Our only regret was that it had  been impossible for us to keep more of the clothing and ammunition. But  although we had not been able to retain it, neither had the enemy. It  was winter, and we had managed to burn their warm clothing. The English  would certainly feel the want of it; and some time must elapse before  they could receive a fresh supply from Europe.    Undoubtedly Lord Roberts would be very angry with me; but I consoled  myself with the thought that his anger would soon blow over. I felt sure  that after calm consideration he would acknowledge that I had been  altogether within my rights, and that he had been rather unwise in  heaping together at one place so large a quantity of insufficiently  protected stores. He should have kept his supplies at Kroonstad, or,  better still, at Bloemfontein, until he had reconstructed all the  railway bridges which we had blown up on the line to Pretoria. Lord  Roberts had already begun to trust the Free-Staters too much; and he had  forgotten that, whatever else we may have been thinking about, never for  a single moment had we thought of surrendering our country.    I received a report the following day that thirty English troops had  been seen eight miles to the west of Roodewal, and moving in the  direction of Kroonstad. I despatched General Froneman with thirty of the  burghers to fetch them in.    The next day, which was the 9th of June, I went with our prisoners to  within three miles of the railway, and left them there under Veldtcornet  De Vos,[51] ordering him to conduct them the rest of the way.    It was now my duty to bring away the ammunition which I had left at  Roodewal and to put it into some safe place. With this in view, I sent  the Commandants, when night had fallen, to Roodewal, each with two  waggons, and ordered them to bring it to my farm at Roodepoort, which  was three miles away from the railway bridge over the Rhenoster River.    There was a ford near my farm with sandy banks; and I told the  Commandants to bury the ammunition in this sand, on the south side of  the river, and to obliterate all traces of what they had done by  crossing and re-crossing the spot with the waggons. I found out  subsequently that the Commandants had left some of the ammunition behind  at Roodewal.    Before I conclude this chapter I have to record an event which filled"]]]
