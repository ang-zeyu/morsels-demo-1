At her death her children inherited the crown: their father had formally  to invest the eldest of them with royal, authority in the room of the  deceased, and with him he shared the externals, if not the reality, of  power.* It is doubtful whether the third Saq-nunri Tiuaa known to us--he  who added an epithet to his name, and was commonly known as Tiuaqni,  \"Tiuaa the brave\"** --united in his person all the requisites of a  Pharaoh qualified to reign in his own right. However this may have been,  at all events his wife, Queen Ahhotpu, possessed them.         * Thus we find Thutmosis I. formally enthroning his daughter       Hat-shopsitu, towards the close of his reign.         ** It would seem that the epithet Qeni ( = the brave, the       robust) did not form an indispensable part of his name, any       more than Ahmosi did of the names of members of the family       of Ahmosis, the conqueror of the Shepherds. It is to him       that the Tiuaa cartouche refers, which is to be found on the       statue mentioned by Daninos-Pasha, published by Bouriant,       and on which we find Ahmosis, a princess of the same name,       together with Queen Ahhotpu I.    His eldest son Ahmosu died prematurely; the two younger brothers, Kamosu  and a second Ahmosu, the Amosis of the Greeks, assumed the crown after  him. It is possible, as frequently happened, that their young sister  Ahmasi-Nofritari entered the harem of both brothers consecutively.    [Illustration: 110.jpg THE HEAD OF SAQNURI]         Drawn by Bouclier, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.    We cannot be sure that she was united to Kamosu, but at all events she  became the wife of Ahmosis, and the rights which she possessed, together  with those which her husband had inherited from their mother Ahhotpu,  gave him a legal claim such as was seldom enjoyed by the Pharaohs of  that period, so many of them being sovereigns merely _de facto,_ while  he was doubly king by right.    Tiuaqni, Kamosu,* and Ahmosis** quickly succeeded each other. Tiuaqni  very probably waged war against the Shepherds, and it is not known  whether he fell upon the field of battle or was the victim of some plot;  the appearance of his mummy proves that he died a violent death when  about forty years of age. Two or three men, whether assassins or  soldiers, must have surrounded and despatched him before help was  available. A blow from an axe must have severed part of his left cheek,  exposed the teeth, fractured the jaw, and sent him senseless to the  ground; another blow must have seriously injured the skull, and a dagger  or javelin has cut open the forehead on the right side, a little above  the eye. His body must have remained lying where it fell for some  time: when found, decomposition had set in, and the embalming had to  be hastily performed as best it might. The hair is thick, rough, and  matted; the face had been shaved on the morning of his death, but by  touching the cheek we can ascertain how harsh and abundant the hair must  have been. The mummy is that of a fine, vigorous man, who might have  lived to a hundred years, and he must have defended himself resolutely  against his assailants; his features bear even now an expression of  fury. A flattened patch of exuded brain appears above one eye, the  forehead is wrinkled, and the lips, which are drawn back in a circle  about the gums, reveal the teeth still biting into the tongue. Kamosu  did not reign long;'we know nothing of the events of his life, but we  owe to him one of the prettiest examples of the Egyptian goldsmith's  art--the gold boat mounted on a carriage of wood and bronze, which  was to convey his double on its journeys through Hades. This boat was  afterwards appropriated by his mother Ahhotpu.         * With regard to Kamosu, we possess, in addition to the       miniature bark which was discovered on the sarcophagus of       Queen Ahhotpu, and which is now in the museum at Gizeh, a       few scattered references to his worship existing on the       monuments, on a stele at Gizeh, on a table of offerings in       the Marseilles Museum, and in the list of princes worshipped       by the \"servants of the Necropolis.\" His pyramid was at Drah-       Abu'l-Neggah, beside those of Iluaa and Amenothes I.         ** The name Amosu or Ahmosi is usually translated \"Child of       the Moon-god\" the real meaning is, \"the Moon-god has brought       forth,\" \"him\" or \"her\" (referring to the person who bears       the name) being understood.    Ahmosisa must have been about twenty-five years of age when he ascended  the throne; he was of medium height, as his body when mummied measured  only 5 feet 6 inches in length, but the development of the neck and  chest indicates extraordinary strength. The head is small in proportion  to the bust, the forehead low and narrow, the cheek-bones project, and  the hair is thick and wavy. The face exactly resembles that of Tiuacrai,  and the likeness alone would proclaim the affinity, even if we were  ignorant of the close relationship which united these two Pharaohs.*  Ahmosis seems to have been a strong, active, warlike man; he was  successful in all the wars in which we know him to have been engaged,  and he ousted the Shepherds from the last towns occupied by them. It is  possible that modern writers have exaggerated the credit due to Ahmosis  for expelling the Hyksos. He found the task already half accomplished,  and the warfare of his forefathers for at least a century must have  prepared the way for his success; if he appears to have played the most  important _role_ in the history of the deliverance, it is owing to our  ignorance of the work of others, and he thus benefits by the oblivion  into which their deeds have passed. Taking this into consideration, we  must still admit that the Shepherds, even when driven into Avaris, were  not adversaries to be despised. Forced by the continual pressure of the  Egyptian armies into this corner of the Delta, they were as a compact  body the more able to make a protracted resistance against very superior  forces.         * Here again my description is taken from the present       appearance of the mummy, which is now in the Gizeh Museum.       It is evident, from the inspection which I have made, that       Ahmosis was about fifty years old at the time of his death,       and, allowing him to have reigned twenty-five years, he must       have been twenty-five or twenty-six when he came to the       throne.

The impenetrable marshes of Menzaleh on the north, and the desert of the  Red Sea on the south, completely covered both their wings; the shifting  network of the branches of the Nile, together with the artificial  canals, protected them as by a series of moats in front, while Syria in  their rear offered them inexhaustible resources for revictualling their  troops, or levying recruits among tribes of kindred race. As long as  they could hold their ground there, a re-invasion was always possible;  one victory would bring them to Memphis, and the whole valley would  again fall under then-suzerainty. Ahmosis, by driving them from their  last stronghold, averted this danger. It is, therefore, not without  reason that the official chroniclers of later times separated him from  his ancestors and made him the head of a new dynasty.    [Illustration: 114.jpg Page Image]    His predecessors had in reality been merely Pharaohs on sufferance,  ruling in the south within the confines of their Theban principality,  gaining in power, it is true, with every generation, but never able to  attain to the suzerainty of the whole country. They were reckoned in  the XVIIth dynasty together with the Hyksos sovereigns of uncontested  legitimacy, while their successors were chosen to constitute  the XVIIIth, comprising Pharaohs with full powers, tolerating no  competitors, and uniting under their firm rule the two regions of  which Egypt was composed--the possessions of Sit and the possessions of  Horus.*         * Manetho, or his abridgers, call the king who drove out the       Shepherds Amosis or Tethmosis. Lepsius thought he saw       grounds for preferring the second reading, and identified       this Tethmosis with Thutmosi Manakhpirri, the ihutmosis III.       of our lists; Ahmosis could only have driven out the greater       part of the nation. This theory, to which Naville still       adheres, as also does Stindorff, was disputed nearly fifty       years ago by E. de Rouge; nowadays we are obliged to admit       that, subsequent to the Vth year of Ahmosis, there were no       longer Shepherd-kings in Egypt, even though a part of the       conquering race may have remained in the country in a state       of slavery, as we shall soon have occasion to observe.    The war of deliverance broke out on the accession of Ahmosis, and  continued during the first five years of his reign.* One of his  lieutenants, the king's namesake--Ahmosi-si-Abina--who belonged to the  family of the lords of Nekhabit, has left us an account, in one of the  inscriptions in his tomb, of the numerous exploits in which he took part  side by side with his royal master, and thus, thanks to this fortunate  record of his vanity, we are not left in complete ignorance of the  events which took place during this crucial struggle between the Asiatic  settlers and their former subjects. Nekhabit had enjoyed considerable  prosperity in the earlier ages of Egyptian history, marking as it  did the extreme southern limit of the kingdom, and forming an outpost  against the barbarous tribes of Nubia. As soon as the progress of  conquest had pushed the frontier as far south as the first cataract,  it declined in importance,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#19)"],[1,"was Memphis, his preference for it arising from his having  possibly been born there, or from its having been assigned to him for  his abode. Here he constructed for himself a magnificent tomb, the  bas-reliefs of which exhibit him as already king, with the sceptre in  his hand and the uraaus on his brow, while the adjoining cartouche does  not as yet contain his name.*         * This part of the account is based upon, a study of a       certain number of texts and representations all coming from       Harmhabi's tomb at Saqqarah, and now scattered among the       various museums--at Gizeh, Leyden, London, and Alexandria.       Birch was the first to assign those monuments to the Pharaoh       Harmhabi, supposing at the same time that he had been       dethroned by Ramses I., and had lived at Memphis in an       intermediate position between that of a prince and that of a       private individual; this opinion was adopted by Ed. Meyer,       rejected by Wiedemann and by myself. After full examination,       I think the Harmhabi of the tomb at Saqqarah and the Pharaoh       Harmhabi are one and the same person; Harmhabi, sufficiently       high placed to warrant his wearing the uraius, but not high       enough to have his name inscribed in a cartouche, must have       had his tomb constructed at Saqqarah, as Ai and possibly       Ramses I. had theirs built for them at Tel el-Amarna.    He was the mighty of the mighty, the great among the great, the general  of generals, the messenger who ran to convey orders to the people of  Asia and Ethiopia, the indispensable companion in council or on the  field of battle,* at the time when Horus of Cynopolis resolved to  seat him upon his eternal throne. Ai no longer occupied it. Horus took  Harmhabi with him to Thebes, escorted him thither amid expressions of  general joy, and led him to Amon in order that the god might bestow upon  him the right to reign. The reception took place in the temple of  Luxor, which served as a kind of private chapel for the descendants of  Amenothes. Amon rejoiced to see Harmhabi, the heir of the two worlds;  he took him with him to the royal palace, introduced him into the  apartments of his august daughter, Mutnozmit; then, after she had  recognised her child and had pressed him to her bosom, all the gods  broke out into acclamations, and their cries ascended up to heaven.**         * The fragments of the tomb preserved at Leyden show him       leading to the Pharaoh Asiatics and Ethiopians, burthened       with tribute. The expressions and titles given above are       borrowed from the fragments at Gizeh.         ** Owing to a gap, the text cannot be accurately translated       at this point. The reading can be made out that Amon \"betook       himself to the palace, placing the prince before him, as far       as the sanctuary of his (Amon's) daughter, the very       august...; she poured water on his hands, she embraced the       beauties (of the prince), she placed herself before him.\" It       will be seen that the name of the daughter of Amon is       wanting, and Birch thought that a terrestrial princess whom       Harmhabi had married was in question, Miifcnozmit, according       to Brugsch. If the reference is not to a goddess, who along       with Amon took part in the ceremonies, but to Mutnozmit, we       must come to the conclusion that she, as heir and queen by       birth, must have ceded her rights by some ritual to her son       before he could be crowned.    \"Behold, Amon arrives with his son before him, at the palace, in order  to put upon his head the diadem, and to prolong the length of his life!  We install him, therefore, in his office, we give to him the insignia of  Ea, we pray Amon for him whom he has brought as our protector: may he as  king have the festivals of Ea and the years of Horus; may he accomplish  his good pleasure in Thebes, in Heliopolis, in Memphis, and may he  add to the veneration with which these cities are invested.\" And  they immediately decided that the new Pharaoh should be called  Horus-sturdy-bull, mighty in wise projects, lord of the Vulture and of  the very marvellous Urseus in Thebes, the conquering Horus who takes  pleasure in the truth, and who maintains the two lands, the lord of the  south and north, Sozir Khopiruri chosen of Ea, the offspring of the Sun,  Harmhabi Miamun, giver of life. The _cortege_ came afterwards to the  palace, the king walking before Amon: there the god embraced his son,  placed the diadems upon his head, delivered to him the rule of the whole  world, over foreign populations as well as those of Egypt, inasmuch as  he possessed this power as the sovereign of the universe.    This is the customary subject of the records of enthronement. Pharaoh is  the son of a god, chosen by his father, from among all those who might  have a claim to it, to occupy for a time the throne of Horus; and as he  became king only by a divine decree, he had publicly to express, at the  moment of his elevation, his debt of gratitude to, and his boundless  respect for, the deity, who had made him what he was. In this case,  however, the protocol embodied something more than the traditional  formality, and its hackneyed phrases borrowed a special meaning from the  circumstances of the moment. Amon, who had been insulted and proscribed  by Khuniatonu, had not fully recovered his prestige under the rule of  the immediate successors of his enemy.    [Illustration: 123.jpg THE FIRST PYLON OF HARMHABI AT KARNAK]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph taken by Beato.    They had restored to him his privileges and his worship, they had become  reconciled to him, and avowed themselves his faithful ones, but all this  was as much an act of political necessity as a matter of religion:  they still continued to tolerate, if not to favour, the rival doctrinal  system, and the temple of the hateful Disk still dishonoured by its  vicinity the sanctuary of Karnak. Harmhabi, on the other hand, was  devoted to Amon, who had moulded him in embryo, and had trained him from  his birth to worship none but him. Harmhabi's triumph marked the end  of the evil days, and inaugurated a new era, in which Amon saw  himself again master of Thebes and of the world. Immediately after his  enthronement Harmhabi rivalled the first Amen-othes in his zeal for the  interests of his divine father: he overturned the obelisks of Atonu and  the building before which they stood; then, that no trace of them might  remain, he worked up the stones into the masonry of two pylons, which he  set up upon the site, to the south of the gates of Thutmosis III. They  remained concealed in the new fabric for centuries, but in the year  27 B.C. a great earthquake brought them abruptly to light. We find  everywhere among the ruins, at the foot of the dislocated gates, or at  the bases of the headless colossal figures, heaps of blocks detached  from the structure, on which can be made out remnants of prayers  addressed to the Disk, scenes of worship, and cartouches of Amenofches  IV., Ai, and Tutankhamon. The work begun by Harmhabi at Thebes  was continued with unabated zeal through the length of the whole  river-valley. \"He restored the sanctuaries from the marshes of Athu even  to Nubia; he repaired their sculptures so that they were better than  before, not to speak of the fine things he did in them, rejoicing the  eyes of Ra. That which he had found injured he put into its original  condition, erecting a hundred statues, carefully formed of valuable  stone, for every one which was lacking. He inspected the ruined towns of  the gods in the land, and made them such as they had been in the time  of the first Ennead, and he allotted to them estates and offerings  for every day, as well as a set of sacred vessels entirely of gold and  silver; he settled priests in them, bookmen, carefully chosen soldiers,  and assigned to them fields, cattle, all the necessary material to  make prayers to Ra every morning.\" These measures were inspired by  consideration for the ancient deities; but he added to them others,  which tended to secure the welfare of the people and the stability of  the government. Up to this time the officials and the Egyptian soldiers  had displayed a tendency to oppress the fellahin, without taking into  consideration the injury to the treasury occasioned by their rapacity.  Constant supervision was the only means of restraining them, for even  the best-served Pharaohs, Thutmosis, and Amenothes III. themselves, were  obliged to have frequent recourse to the rigour of the law to keep the  scandalous depredations of the officials within bounds.*         * Harmhabi refers to the edicts of Thutmosis III.    The religious disputes of the preceding years, in enfeebling the  authority of the central power, had given a free hand to these  oppressors. The scribes and tax-collectors were accustomed to exact  contributions for the public service from the ships, whether laden or  not, of those who were in a small way of business, and once they had  laid their hands upon them, they did not readily let them go. The poor  fellow falling into their clutches lost his cargo, and he was at his  wits' end to know how to deliver at the royal storehouses the various  wares with which he calculated to pay his taxes. No sooner had the  Court arrived at some place than the servants scoured the neighbourhood,  confiscating the land produce, and seizing upon slaves, under pretence  that they were acting for the king, while they had only their personal  ends in view. Soldiers appropriated all the hides of animals with the  object, doubtless, of making from them leather jackets and helmets, or  of duplicating their shields, with the result that when the treasury  made its claim for leather, none was to be found. It was hardly  possible, moreover, to bring the culprits to justice, for the chief men  of the towns and villages, the prophets, and"]]]
