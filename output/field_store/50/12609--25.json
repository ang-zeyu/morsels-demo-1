They were also similarly manifested from time to time in various  forms. Sometimes they were comely and beautiful; at other times they  were apparitions of horror. The Jinn of present-day Arabians are of  like character; these may be giants, cloudy shapes, comely women,  serpents or cats, goats or pigs.    Some of the composite monsters of Babylonia may suggest the vague and  exaggerated recollections of terror-stricken people who have had  glimpses of unfamiliar wild beasts in the dusk or amidst reedy  marshes. But they cannot be wholly accounted for in this way. While  animals were often identified with supernatural beings, and foreigners  were called \"devils\", it would be misleading to assert that the spirit  world reflects confused folk memories of human and bestial enemies.  Even when a demon was given concrete human form it remained  essentially non-human: no ordinary weapon could inflict an injury, and  it was never controlled by natural laws. The spirits of disease and  tempest and darkness were creations of fancy: they symbolized moods;  they were the causes which explained effects. A sculptor or  storyteller who desired to convey an impression of a spirit of storm  or pestilence created monstrous forms to inspire terror. Sudden and  unexpected visits of fierce and devastating demons were accounted for  by asserting that they had wings like eagles, were nimble-footed as  gazelles, cunning and watchful as serpents; that they had claws to  clutch, horns to gore, and powerful fore legs like a lion to smite  down victims. Withal they drank blood like ravens and devoured corpses  like hyaenas. Monsters were all the more repulsive when they were  partly human. The human-headed snake or the snake-headed man and the  man with the horns of a wild bull and the legs of a goat were horrible  in the extreme. Evil spirits might sometimes achieve success by  practising deception. They might appear as beautiful girls or handsome  men and seize unsuspecting victims in deathly embrace or leave them  demented and full of grief, or come as birds and suddenly assume  awesome shapes.    Fairies and elves, and other half-human demons, are sometimes regarded  as degenerate gods. It will be seen, however, that while certain  spirits developed into deities, others remained something between  these two classes of supernatural beings: they might attend upon gods  and goddesses, or operate independently now against mankind and now  against deities even. The \"namtaru\", for instance, was a spirit of  fate, the son of Bel-Enlil and Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades.  \"Apparently\", writes Professor Pinches, \"he executed the instructions  given him concerning the fate of men, and could also have power over  certain of the gods.\"[103] To this middle class belong the evil gods  who rebelled against the beneficent deities. According to Hebridean  folk belief, the fallen angels are divided into three classes--the  fairies, the \"nimble men\" (aurora borealis), and the \"blue men of the  Minch\". In _Beowulf_ the \"brood of Cain\" includes \"monsters and elves  and sea-devils--giants also, who long time fought with God, for which  he gave them their reward\".[104] Similarly the Babylonian spirit  groups are liable to division and subdivision. The various classes may  be regarded as relics of the various stages of development from crude  animism to sublime monotheism: in the fragmentary legends we trace the  floating material from which great mythologies have been framed.

Among the gods of Babylonia none achieved wider and more enduring  fame than Tammuz, who was loved by Ishtar, the amorous Queen of  Heaven--the beautiful youth who died and was mourned for and came to  life again. He does not figure by his popular name in any of the city  pantheons, but from the earliest times of which we have knowledge  until the passing of Babylonian civilization, he played a prominent  part in the religious life of the people.    Tammuz, like Osiris of Egypt, was an agricultural deity, and as the  Babylonian harvest was the gift of the rivers, it is probable that one  of his several forms was Dumu-zi-abzu, \"Tammuz of the Abyss\". He was  also \"the child\", \"the heroic lord\", \"the sentinel\", \"the healer\", and  the patriarch who reigned over the early Babylonians for a  considerable period. \"Tammuz of the Abyss\" was one of the members of  the family of Ea, god of the Deep, whose other sons, in addition to  Merodach, were Nira, an obscure deity; Ki-gulla, \"world destroyer\",  Burnunta-sa, \"broad ear\", and Bara and Baragulla, probably \"revealers\"  or \"oracles\". In addition there was a daughter, Khi-dimme-azaga,  \"child of the renowned spirit\". She may have been identical with  Belit-sheri, who is referred to in the Sumerian hymns as the sister of  Tammuz. This family group was probably formed by symbolizing the  attributes of Ea and his spouse Damkina. Tammuz, in his character as a  patriarch, may have been regarded as a hostage from the gods: the  human form of Ea, who instructed mankind, like King Osiris, how to  grow corn and cultivate fruit trees. As the youth who perished  annually, he was the corn spirit. He is referred to in the Bible by  his Babylonian name.    When Ezekiel detailed the various idolatrous practices of the  Israelites, which included the worship of the sun and \"every form of  creeping things and abominable beasts\"--a suggestion of the composite  monsters of Babylonia--he was brought \"to the door of the gate of the  Lord's house, which was towards the north; and, behold, there sat  women weeping for Tammuz\".[105]    The weeping ceremony was connected with agricultural rites. Corn  deities were weeping deities, they shed fertilizing tears; and the  sowers simulated the sorrow of divine mourners when they cast seed in  the soil \"to die\", so that it might spring up as corn. This ancient  custom, like many others, contributed to the poetic imagery of the  Bible. \"They that sow in tears\", David sang, \"shall reap in joy. He  that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless  come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[106] In  Egypt the priestesses who acted the parts of Isis and Nepthys, mourned  for the slain corn god Osiris.        Gods and men before the face of the gods are weeping for        thee at the same time, when they behold me!...      All thy sister goddesses are at thy side and behind thy couch,      Calling upon thee with weeping--yet thou are prostrate upon        thy bed!...      Live before us, desiring to behold thee.[107]    It was believed to be essential that human beings should share the  universal sorrow caused by the death of a god. If they remained  unsympathetic, the deities would punish them as enemies. Worshippers  of nature gods, therefore, based their ceremonial practices on natural  phenomena. \"The dread of the worshippers that the neglect of the usual  ritual would be followed by disaster, is particularly intelligible\",  writes Professor Robertson Smith, \"if they regarded the necessary  operations of agriculture as involving the violent extinction of a  particle of divine life.\"[108] By observing their ritual, the  worshippers won the sympathy and co-operation of deities, or exercised  a magical control over nature.    The Babylonian myth of Tammuz, the dying god, bears a close  resemblance to the Greek myth of Adonis. It also links with the myth  of Osiris. According to Professor Sayce, Tammuz is identical with  \"Daonus or Daos, the shepherd of Pantibibla\", referred to by Berosus  as the ruler of one of the mythical ages of Babylonia. We have  therefore to deal with Tammuz in his twofold character as a patriarch  and a god of fertility.    The Adonis version of the myth may be summarized briefly. Ere the god  was born, his mother, who was pursued by her angry sire, as the river  goddesses of the folk tales are pursued by the well demons,  transformed herself into a tree. Adonis sprang from the trunk of this  tree, and Aphrodite, having placed the child in a chest, committed him  to the care of Persephone, queen of Hades, who resembles the  Babylonian Eresh-ki-gal. Persephone desired to retain the young god,  and Aphrodite (Ishtar) appealed to Zeus (Anu), who decreed that Adonis  should spend part of the year with one goddess and part of the year  with the other.    It is suggested that the myth of Adonis was derived in post-Homeric  times by the Greeks indirectly from Babylonia through the Western  Semites, the Semitic title \"Adon\", meaning \"lord\", having been  mistaken for a proper name. This theory, however, cannot be accepted  without qualifications. It does not explain the existence of either  the Phrygian myth of Attis, which was developed differently from the  Tammuz myth, or the Celtic story of \"Diarmid and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#19)"],[1,"in them, so that nothing is ever to be  heard of it? This is a wide-spread delusion. Let us look at a few of  those to whom expression has come of itself. X. plays skilfully and  correctly, but his expression continues crude, cold, monotonous; he  shows too pedantic a solicitude about mechanical execution and strict  time; he never ventures on a _pp._, uses too little shading in _piano_,  and plays the _forte_ too heavily, and without regard to the instrument;  his _crescendi_ and _diminuendi_ are inappropriate, often coarse and  brought in at unsuitable places; and--his _ritardandi_! they are tedious  indeed! \"But Miss Z. plays differently and more finely.\" Truly, she  plays differently; but is it more finely? Do you like this gentle violet  blue, this sickly paleness, these rouged falsehoods, at the expense of  all integrity of character? this sweet, embellished, languishing style,  this _rubato_ and dismembering of the musical phrases, this want of  time, and this sentimental trash? They both have talent, but their  expression was allowed to be developed of itself. They both would have  been very good players; but now they have lost all taste for the ideal,  which manifests itself in the domain of truth, beauty, and simplicity.  If pupils are left to themselves, they imitate the improper and  erroneous easily and skilfully; the right and suitable with difficulty,  and certainly unskilfully. Even the little fellow who can hardly speak  learns to use naughty, abusive words more quickly and easily than fine,  noble expressions. What school-master has not been surprised at this  facility, and what good old aunt has not laughed at it? But you say, \"It  is not right to force the feelings of others!\" That is quite  unnecessary; but it is possible to rouse the feelings of others, to  guide and educate them, without prejudicing their individuality of  feeling, and without restraining or disturbing them, unless they are on  the wrong path. Who has not listened to performers and singers who were  otherwise musical, but whose sentiment was either ridiculous or  lamentable?           *       *       *       *       *    It is generally acknowledged that, among other things, I have succeeded  more or less with all my scholars in the attainment of a fine touch.  People desire to obtain from me the requisite exercises for the  development of this; but not much can be gained from these. The  important thing is _how_ and _when_ they are to be used; and that most  careful attention shall be paid in the selection of other etudes and  pieces, in order that nothing shall be played which shall endanger the  confirmation of the correct touch already acquired, or shall undo what  has been accomplished in the lessons. As I have said before, it does not  depend upon much practising, but upon correct practising; and that the  pupils shall not be allowed to fall into errors. I am constantly asked,  \"How many hours a day do your daughters practise?\" If the number of  hours spent in practising gives the measure of the standing of a  _virtuoso_, then my daughters are among the most insignificant, or in  fact should not belong to the order at all.    This is the place for me to explain myself more fully with regard to  playing with a loose wrist, in order that I shall not be misunderstood.  The tones which are produced with a loose wrist are always more tender  and more attractive, have a fuller sound, and permit more delicate  shading than the sharp tones, without body, which are thrown or fired  off or tapped out with unendurable rigidity by the aid of the arm and  fore-arm. A superior technique can with few exceptions be more quickly  and favorably acquired in this way than when the elbows are required to  contribute their power. I do not, however, censure the performance of  many _virtuosos_, who execute rapid octave passages with a stiff wrist;  they often do it with great precision, in the most rapid _tempo_,  forcibly and effectively. It must, after all, depend upon individual  peculiarities whether the pupil can learn better and more quickly to  play such passages thus or with a loose wrist. The present style of  bravoura playing for _virtuosos_ cannot dispense with facility in octave  passages; it is a necessary part of it.    I will now consider the use of loose and independent fingers, in playing  generally; _i.e._, in that of more advanced pupils who have already  acquired the necessary elementary knowledge. The fingers must be set  upon the keys with a certain decision, firmness, quickness, and vigor,  and must obtain a command over the key-board; otherwise, the result is  only a tame, colorless, uncertain, immature style of playing, in which  no fine _portamento_, no poignant _staccato_, or sprightly accentuation  can be produced. Every thoughtful teacher, striving for the best result,  must, however, take care that this shall only be acquired gradually, and  must teach it with a constant regard to individual peculiarities, and  not at the expense of beauty of performance, and of a tender, agreeable  touch.           *       *       *       *       *    It is a mortifying fact for many critics, artists, composers, and  teachers, that the general public show much more correct judgment and  appreciation of a fine, noble piano performance, and of a simple, pure,  well-taught style of singing, and also understand the characteristics  of the performer, much more quickly than they do. The sensibility and  appreciation of beauty with the public is less prejudiced, less  spurious, more receptive, and more artless. Its perceptions are not  disturbed by theories, by a desire to criticise, and many other  secondary matters. The public do not take a biassed or stilted view. The  admiration for Jenny Lind is a striking proof of this, as is also the  appreciation of many piano-players.           *       *       *       *       *    The age of progress announces, in piano-playing also, \"a higher beauty\"  than has hitherto existed. Now, I demand of all the defenders of this  new style, wherein is this superior beauty supposed to consist? It is  useless to talk, in a vague way, about a beauty which no one can  explain. I have listened to the playing--no, the thrumming and  stamping--of many of these champions of the modern style of beauty; and  I have come to the conclusion, according to my way of reasoning, that it  ought to be called a higher,--quite different, inverted beauty,--a  deformed beauty, repugnant to the sensibilities of all mankind. But our  gifted \"age of the future\" protests against such cold conservatism. The  period of piano fury which I have lived to see, and which I have just  described, was the introduction to this new essay, only a feeble  attempt, and a preliminary to this piano future. Should this senseless  raging and storming upon the piano, where not one idea can be  intelligently expressed in a half-hour, this abhorrent and rude  treatment of a grand concert piano, combined with frightful misuse of  both pedals, which puts the hearer into agonies of horror and spasms of  terror, ever be regarded as any thing but a return to barbarism, devoid  of feeling and reason? This is to be called music! music of the future!  the beauty of the future style! Truly, for this style of music, the ears  must be differently constructed, the feelings must be differently  constituted, and a different nervous system must be created! For this  again we shall need surgeons, who lie in wait in the background with the  throat improvers. What a new and grand field of operations lies open to  them! Our age produces monsters, who are insensible to the plainest  truths, and who fill humanity with horror. Political excesses have  hardly ceased, when still greater ones must be repeated in the world of  music. But comfort yourselves, my readers: these isolated instances of  madness, these last convulsions of musical insanity, with however much  arrogance they may be proclaimed, will not take the world by storm. The  time will come when no audience, not even eager possessors of  complimentary tickets, but only a few needy hirelings, will venture to  endure such concert performances of \"the future.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I ought to express myself more fully with regard to expression in  piano-playing. It is difficult to perform this task, at least in  writing; for it can more easily be practically explained to individual  learners. Intelligent teachers, who are inclined to understand my  meaning, will find abundant material, as well as all necessary  explanations, in the preceding chapters; and I will merely say that a  teacher who is endowed with the qualities which I have designated as  \"the three trifles\" will seek to excite the same in his pupils; will  refine and cultivate them, according to his ability, with  disinterestedness, with energy, and with perseverance; and truth and  beauty will everywhere be the result. Thus he will remain in the  present, where there is so much remaining to be accomplished. These  three trifles certainly do not have their root in folly, want of talent,  and hare-brained madness; therefore the possessors of the latter must  look to the \"future,\" and proclaim a \"higher,\" that is, an \"inverted  beauty.\"      _Rules for Piano Pupils._    You must never begin to learn a second piece until you have entirely  conquered the first.    You ought to fix your eyes very carefully on the notes, and not to trust  to memory; otherwise, you will never learn to play at sight.    In order to avoid the habit of false fingering, you should not play any  piece which is not marked for the proper fingers.    You should learn to play chords and skipping notes, without looking at  the keys, as this interferes with a prompt reading of the notes.    You must learn to count nicely in playing, in order always to keep  strict time.    To use for once the language of the times, which boldly proclaims, \"Such"]]]
