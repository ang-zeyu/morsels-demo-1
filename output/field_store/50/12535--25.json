Surely I could not be deceived so often. I have  now, at least, six times heard a sound as if some one was outside by the  windows.\"    \"No, no, my darling, do not think; your imagination is active and in a  state of excitement.\"    \"It is, and yet--\"    \"Believe me, it deceives you.\"    \"I hope to Heaven it does!\"    There was a pause of some minutes' duration, and then Mrs. Bannerworth  again urged slightly the calling of some of the servants, for she  thought that their presence might have the effect of giving a different  direction to her child's thoughts; but Flora saw her place her hand upon  the bell, and she said,--    \"No, mother, no--not yet, not yet. Perhaps I am deceived.\"    Mrs. Bannerworth upon this sat down, but no sooner had she done so than  she heartily regretted she had not rung the bell, for, before, another  word could be spoken, there came too perceptibly upon their ears for  there to be any mistake at all about it, a strange scratching noise upon  the window outside.    A faint cry came from Flora's lips, as she exclaimed, in a voice of  great agony,--    \"Oh, God!--oh, God! It has come again!\"    Mrs. Bannerworth became faint, and unable to move or speak at all; she  could only sit like one paralysed, and unable to do more than listen to  and see what was going on.    The scratching noise continued for a few seconds, and then altogether  ceased. Perhaps, under ordinary circumstances, such a sound outside the  window would have scarcely afforded food for comment at all, or, if it  had, it would have been attributed to some natural effect, or to the  exertions of some bird or animal to obtain admittance to the house.    But there had occurred now enough in that family to make any little  sound of wonderful importance, and these things which before would have  passed completely unheeded, at all events without creating much alarm,  were now invested with a fearful interest.    When the scratching noise ceased, Flora spoke in a low, anxious whisper,  as she said,--    \"Mother, you heard it then?\"    Mrs. Bannerworth tried to speak, but she could not; and then suddenly,  with a loud clash, the bar, which on the inside appeared to fasten the  shutters strongly, fell as if by some invisible agency, and the shutters  now, but for the intervention of the window, could be easily pushed open  from without.    Mrs. Bannerworth covered her face with her hands, and, after rocking to  and fro for a moment, she fell off her chair, having fainted with the  excess of terror that came over her.    For about the space of time in which a fast speaker could count twelve,  Flora thought her reason was leaving her, but it did not. She found  herself recovering; and there she sat, with her eyes fixed upon the  window, looking more like some exquisitely-chiselled statue of despair  than a being of flesh and blood, expecting each moment to have its eyes  blasted by some horrible appearance, such as might be supposed to drive  her to madness.    And now again came the strange knocking or scratching against the glass  of the window.    This continued for some minutes, during which it appeared likewise to  Flora that some confusion was going on at another part of the house, for  she fancied she heard voices and the banging of doors.    It seemed to her as if she must have sat looking at the shutters of that  window a long time before she saw them shake, and then one wide hinged  portion of them slowly opened.    Once again horror appeared to be on the point of producing madness in  her brain, and then, as before, a feeling of calmness rapidly ensued.    She was able to see plainly that something was by the window, but what  it was she could not plainly discern, in consequence of the lights she  had in the room. A few moments, however, sufficed to settle that  mystery, for the window was opened and a figure stood before her.    One glance, one terrified glance, in which her whole soul was  concentrated, sufficed to shew her who and what the figure was. There  was the tall, gaunt form--there was the faded ancient apparel--the  lustrous metallic-looking eyes--its half-opened month, exhibiting the  tusk-like teeth! It was--yes, it was--_the vampyre!_    It stood for a moment gazing at her, and then in the hideous way it had  attempted before to speak, it apparently endeavoured to utter some words  which it could not make articulate to human ears. The pistols lay before  Flora. Mechanically she raised one, and pointed it at the figure. It  advanced a step, and then she pulled the trigger.    A stunning report followed. There was a loud cry of pain, and the  vampyre fled. The smoke and the confusion that was incidental to the  spot prevented her from seeing if the figure walked or ran away. She  thought she heard a crashing sound among the plants outside the window,  as if it had fallen, but she did not feel quite sure.    It was no effort of any reflection, but a purely mechanical movement,  that made her raise the other pistol, and discharge that likewise in the  direction the vampyre had taken. Then casting the weapon away, she rose,  and made a frantic rush from the room. She opened the door, and was  dashing out, when she found herself caught in the circling arms of some  one who either had been there waiting, or who had just at that moment  got there.    The thought that it was the vampyre, who by some mysterious means, had  got there, and was about to make her his prey, now overcame her  completely, and she sunk into a state of utter insensibility on the  moment.          CHAPTER X.    THE RETURN FROM THE VAULT.--THE ALARM, AND THE SEARCH AROUND THE HALL.      [Illustration]    It so happened that George and Henry Bannerworth, along with Mr.  Marchdale, had just reached the gate which conducted into the garden of  the mansion when they all were alarmed by the report of a pistol. Amid  the stillness of the night, it came upon them with so sudden a shock,  that they involuntarily paused, and there came from the lips of each an  expression of alarm.    \"Good heavens!\" cried George, \"can that be Flora firing at any  intruder?\"    \"It must be,\" cried Henry; \"she has in her possession the only weapons  in the house.\"    Mr. Marchdale turned very pale, and trembled slightly, but he did not  speak.    \"On, on,\" cried Henry; \"for God's sake, let us hasten on.\"    As he spoke, he cleared the gate at a bound, and at a terrific pace he  made towards the house, passing over beds, and plantations, and flowers  heedlessly, so that he went the most direct way to it.    Before, however, it was possible for any human speed to accomplish even  half of the distance, the report of the other shot came upon his ears,  and he even fancied he heard the bullet whistle past his head in  tolerably close proximity. This supposition gave him a clue to the  direction at all events from whence the shots proceeded, otherwise he  knew not from which window they were fired, because it had not occurred  to him, previous to leaving home, to inquire in which room Flora and his  mother were likely to be seated waiting his return.    He was right as regarded the bullet. It was that winged messenger of  death which had passed his head in such very dangerous proximity, and  consequently he made with tolerable accuracy towards the open window  from whence the shots had been fired.    The night was not near so dark as it had been, although even yet it was  very far from being a light one, and he was soon enabled to see that  there was a room, the window of which was wide open, and lights burning  on the table within. He made towards it in a moment, and entered it. To  his astonishment, the first objects he beheld were Flora and a stranger,  who was now supporting her in his arms. To grapple him by the throat was  the work of a moment, but the stranger cried aloud in a voice which  sounded familiar to Harry,--    \"Good God, are you all mad?\"    Henry relaxed his hold, and looked in his face.    \"Gracious heavens, it is Mr. Holland!\" he said.    \"Yes; did you not know me?\"    Henry was bewildered. He staggered to a seat, and, in doing so, he saw  his mother, stretched apparently lifeless upon the floor. To raise her  was the work of a moment, and then Marchdale and George, who had  followed him as fast as they could, appeared at the open window.    Such a strange scene as that small room now exhibited had never been  equalled in Bannerworth Hall. There was young Mr. Holland, of whom  mention has already been made, as the affianced lover of Flora,  supporting her fainting form. There was Henry doing equal service to his  mother; and on the floor lay the two pistols, and one of the candles  which had been upset in the confusion; while the terrified attitudes of  George and Mr. Marchdale at the window completed the strange-looking  picture.    \"What is this--oh! what has happened?\" cried George.    \"I know not--I know not,\" said Henry. \"Some one summon the servants; I  am nearly mad.\"    Mr. Marchdale at once rung the bell, for George looked so faint and ill  as to be incapable of doing so; and he rung it so loudly and so  effectually, that the two servants who had been employed suddenly upon  the others leaving came with much speed to know what was the matter.    \"See to your mistress,\" said Henry. \"She is dead, or has fainted. For  God's sake, let who can give me some account of what has caused all this  confusion here.\"    \"Are you aware, Henry,\" said Marchdale, \"tha"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#19)"],[1,"chin  as sharp as a dagger, the gifted Spaniard would trace a pair of nearly  round eyes, and at the centre of each pupil he would aim a white brush  stroke, a point of light . . . the soul. Then, planting himself  before the canvas, he would proceed to classify this soul with his  inexhaustible imagination, attributing to it almost every kind of stress  and extremity. So great was the sway of his rapture that Julio, too, was  able to see all that the artist flattered himself into believing that he  had put into the owlish eyes. He, also, would paint souls . . . souls of  women.    In spite of the ease with which he developed his psychological  creations, Argensola preferred to talk, stretched on a divan, or to  read, hugging the fire while his friend and protector was outside.  Another advantage this fondness for reading gave young Desnoyers was  that he was no longer obliged to open a volume, scanning the index and  last pages \"just to get the idea.\" Formerly when frequenting society  functions, he had been guilty of coolly asking an author which was his  best book--his smile of a clever man--giving the writer to understand  that he merely enquired so as not to waste time on the other volumes.  Now it was no longer necessary to do this; Argensola would read for him.  As soon as Julio would see him absorbed in a book, he would demand an  immediate share: \"Tell me the story.\" So the \"secretary,\" not only gave  him the plots of comedies and novels, but also detailed the argument of  Schopenhauer or of Nietzsche . . . Dona Luisa almost wept on hearing her  visitors--with that benevolence which wealth always inspires--speak of  her son as \"a rather gay young man, but wonderfully well read!\"    In exchange for his lessons, Argensola received, much the same treatment  as did the Greek slaves who taught rhetoric to the young patricians of  decadent Rome. In the midst of a dissertation, his lord and friend would  interrupt him with--\"Get my dress suit ready. I am invited out this  evening.\"    At other times, when the instructor was luxuriating in bodily comfort,  with a book in one hand near the roaring stove, seeing through the  windows the gray and rainy afternoon, his disciple would suddenly appear  saying, \"Quick, get out! . . . There's a woman coming!\"    And Argensola, like a dog who gets up and shakes himself, would  disappear to continue his reading in some miserable little coffee house  in the neighborhood.    In his official capacity, this widely gifted man often descended from  the peaks of intellectuality to the vulgarities of everyday life. He  was the steward of the lord of the manor, the intermediary between the  pocketbook and those who appeared bill in hand. \"Money!\" he would say  laconically at the end of the month, and Desnoyers would break out into  complaints and curses. Where on earth was he to get it, he would like to  know. His father was as regular as a machine, and would never allow the  slightest advance upon the following month. He had to submit to a rule  of misery. Three thousand francs a month!--what could any decent person  do with that? . . . He was even trying to cut THAT down, to tighten the  band, interfering in the running of his house, so that Dona Luisa could  not make presents to her son. In vain he had appealed to the various  usurers of Paris, telling them of his property beyond the ocean. These  gentlemen had the youth of their own country in the hollow of their hand  and were not obliged to risk their capital in other lands. The same hard  luck pursued him when, with sudden demonstrations of affection, he had  tried to convince Don Marcelo that three thousand francs a month was but  a niggardly trifle.    The millionaire fairly snorted with indignation. \"Three thousand francs  a trifle!\" And the debts besides, that he often had to pay for his son!  . . .    \"Why, when I was your age,\" . . . he would begin saying--but Julio would  suddenly bring the dialogue to a close. He had heard his father's story  too many times. Ah, the stingy old miser! What he had been giving him  all these months was no more than the interest on his grandfather's  legacy. . . . And by the advice of Argensola he ventured to get control  of the field. He was planning to hand over the management of his land to  Celedonio, the old overseer, who was now such a grandee in his country  that Julio ironically called him \"my uncle.\"    Desnoyers accepted this rebellion coldly. \"It appears just to me. You  are now of age!\" Then he promptly reduced to extremes his oversight  of his home, forbidding Dona Luisa to handle any money. Henceforth he  regarded his son as an adversary, treating him during his lightning  apparitions at the avenue Victor Hugo with glacial courtesy as though he  were a stranger.    For a while a transitory opulence enlivened the studio. Julio had  increased his expenses, considering himself rich. But the letters from  his uncle in America soon dissipated these illusions. At first the  remittances exceeded very slightly the monthly allowance that his father  had made him. Then it began to diminish in an alarming manner. According  to Celedonio, all the calamities on earth seemed to be falling upon his  plantation. The pasture land was yielding scantily, sometimes for lack  of rain, sometimes because of floods, and the herds were perishing by  hundreds. Julio required more income, and the crafty half-breed sent him  what he asked for, but simply as a loan, reserving the return until they  should adjust their accounts.    In spite of such aid, young Desnoyers was suffering great want. He was  gambling now in an elegant circle, thinking thus to compensate for his  periodical scrimpings; but this resort was only making the remittances  from America disappear with greater rapidity. . . . That such a man as  he was should be tormented so for the lack of a few thousand francs!  What else was a millionaire father for?    If the creditors began threatening, the poor youth had to bring the  secretary into play, ordering him to see the mother immediately; he  himself wished to avoid her tears and reproaches. So Argensola would  slip like a pickpocket up the service stairway of the great house on the  avenue Victor Hugo. The place in which he transacted his ambassadorial  business was the kitchen, with great danger that the terrible Desnoyers  might happen in there, on one of his perambulations as a laboring man,  and surprise the intruder.    Dona Luisa would weep, touched by the heartrending tales of the  messenger. What could she do! She was as poor as her maids; she had  jewels, many jewels, but not a franc. Then Argensola came to the rescue  with a solution worthy of his experience. He would smooth the way for  the good mother, leaving some of her jewels at the Mont-de-Piete. He  knew the way to raise money on them. So the lady accepted his advice,  giving him, however, only jewels of medium value as she suspected that  she might never see them again. Later scruples made her at times refuse  flatly. Suppose Don Marcelo should ever find it out, what a scene! . . .  But the Spaniard deemed it unseemly to return empty-handed, and always  bore away a basket of bottles from the well-stocked wine-cellar of the  Desnoyers.    Every morning Dona Luisa went to Saint-Honore-d'Eylau to pray for her  son. She felt that this was her own church. It was a hospitable and  familiar island in the unexplored ocean of Paris. Here she could  exchange discreet salutations with her neighbors from the different  republics of the new world. She felt nearer to God and the saints when  she could hear in the vestibule conversations in her language.    It was, moreover, a sort of salon in which took place the great events  of the South American colony. One day was a wedding with flowers,  orchestra and chanting chorals. With Chichi beside her, she greeted  those she knew, congratulating the bride and groom. Another day it was  the funeral of an ex-president of some republic, or some other foreign  dignitary ending in Paris his turbulent existence. Poor President! Poor  General! . . .    Dona Luisa remembered the dead man. She had seen him many times in that  church devoutly attending mass and she was indignant at the evil tongues  which, under the cover of a funeral oration, recalled the shootings and  bank failures in his country. Such a good and religious gentleman! May  God receive his soul in glory! . . . And upon going out into the  square, she would look with tender eyes upon the young men and women on  horseback going to the Bois de Boulogne, the luxurious automobiles, the  morning radiant in the sunshine, all the primeval freshness of the early  hours--realizing what a beautiful thing it is to live.    Her devout expression of gratitude for mere existence usually included  the monument in the centre of the square, all bristling with wings as if  about to fly away from the ground. Victor Hugo! . . . It was enough  for her to have heard this name on the lips of her son to make her  contemplate the statue with a family interest. The only thing that she  knew about the poet was that he had died. Of this she was almost sure,  and she imagined that in life, he was a great friend of Julio's because  she had so often heard her son repeat his name.    Ay, her son! . . . All her thoughts, her conjectures, her desires,  converged on him and her strong-willed husband. She longed for the men  to come to an understanding and put an end to a struggle in which she  was the principal victim. Would not God work this miracle? . . . Like  an invalid who goes from one sanitarium to another in pursuit of health,  she gave up the church on her street to attend the Spanish chapel on the  avenue Friedland. Here she considered herself even more among her own.    In the midst of the fine and elegant South American ladies who looked  as if they had just escaped from a fashion sheet, her eyes sought other  women, not so well dressed, fat,"]]]
