He  carries a cap with a long, red feather._)    THE MANAGER (_bowing deeply_). Ladies and gentlemen, you are about  to hear the truth of an old legend that has persisted wrongly  through the ages, the truth that, until now, has been hid behind  the embroidered curtain of a rhyme, about the Knave of Hearts,  who was no knave but a very hero indeed. The truth, you will  agree with me, gentlemen and most honored ladies, is rare! It is  only the quiet, unimpassioned things of nature that seem what  they are. Clouds rolled in massy radiance against the blue, pines  shadowed deep and darkly green, mirrored in still waters, the  contemplative mystery of the hills--these things which exist,  absorbed but in their own existence--these are the perfect  chalices of truth.    But we, gentlemen and thrice-honored ladies, flounder about in a  tangled net of prejudice, of intrigue. We are blinded by  conventions, we are crushed by misunderstanding, we are  distracted by violence, we are deceived by hypocrisy, until only  too often villains receive the rewards of nobility and the truly  great-hearted are suspected, distrusted, and maligned.    And so, ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of justice and also, I  dare to hope, for your approval, I have taken my puppets down  from their dusty shelves. I have polished their faces, brushed  their clothes, and strung them on wires, so that they may enact  for you this history.    (_He parts the curtains, revealing two_ PASTRY COOKS _in flaring  white caps and spotless aprons leaning over in stiff profile,  their wooden spoons, three feet long, pointing rigidly to the  ceiling. They are in one of the kitchens of_ POMPDEBILE THE  EIGHTH, KING OF HEARTS. _It is a pleasant kitchen, with a row of  little dormer windows and a huge stove, adorned with the crest of_  POMPDEBILE--_a heart rampant, on a gold shield._)    THE MANAGER. You see here, ladies and gentlemen, two pastry cooks  belonging to the royal household of Pompdebile the Eighth--Blue  Hose and Yellow Hose, by name. At a signal from me they will  spring to action, and as they have been made with astonishing  cleverness, they will bear every semblance of life. Happily,  however, you need have no fear that, should they please you, the  exulting wine of your appreciation may go to their heads--their  heads being but things of wire and wood; and happily, too, as  they are but wood and wire, they will be spared the shame and  humiliation that would otherwise be theirs should they fail to  meet with your approval.    The play, most honored ladies and gentlemen, will now begin.    (_He claps his hands. Instantly the two_ PASTRY COOKS _come to life._  THE MANAGER _bows himself off the stage._)    BLUE HOSE. Is everything ready for this great event?    YELLOW HOSE. Everything. The fire blazing in the stove, the  Pages, dressed in their best, waiting in the pantry with their  various jars full of the finest butter, the sweetest sugar, the  hottest pepper, the richest milk, the--    BLUE HOSE. Yes, yes, no doubt. (_Thoughtfully_) It is a great  responsibility, this that they have put on our shoulders.    YELLOW HOSE. Ah, yes. I have never felt more important.    BLUE HOSE. Nor I more uncomfortable.    YELLOW HOSE. Even on the day, or rather the night, when I awoke  and found myself famous--I refer to the time when I laid before  an astonished world my creation, \"Humming birds' hearts souffle,  au vin blanc\"--I did not feel more important. It is a pleasing  sensation!    BLUE HOSE. I like it not at all. It makes me dizzy, this eminence  on which they have placed us. The Lady Violetta is slim and fair.  She does not, in my opinion, look like the kind of person who is  capable of making good pastry. I have discovered through long  experience that it is the heaviest women who make the lightest  pastry, and _vice versa._ Well, then, suppose that she does  not pass this examination--suppose that her pastry is lumpy,  white like the skin of a boiled fowl.    YELLOW HOSE. Then, according to the law of the Kingdom of Hearts,  we must condemn it, and the Lady Violetta cannot become the bride  of Pompdebile. Back to her native land she will be sent, riding a  mule.    BLUE HOSE. And she is so pretty, so exquisite! What a law! What  an outrageous law!    YELLOW HOSE. Outrageous law! How dare you! There is nothing so  necessary to the welfare of the nation as our art. Good cooks  make good tempers, don't they? Must not the queen set an example  for the other women to follow? Did not our fathers and our  grandfathers before us judge the dishes of the previous queens of  hearts?    BLUE HOSE. I wish I were mixing the rolls for to-morrow's  breakfast.    YELLOW HOSE. Bah! You are fit for nothing else. The affairs of  state are beyond you.    (_Distant sound of trumpets._)    BLUE HOSE (_nervously_). What's that?    YELLOW HOSE. The King is approaching! The ceremonies are about to  commence!    BLUE HOSE. Is everything ready?    YELLOW HOSE. I told you that everything was ready. Stand still;  you are as white as a stalk of celery.    BLUE HOSE (_counting on his fingers_). Apples, lemons, peaches,  jam--Jam! Did you forget jam?    YELLOW HOSE. Zounds, I did!    BLUE HOSE (_wailing_). We are lost!    YELLOW HOSE. She may not call for it.    (_Both stand very erect and make a desperate effort to appear  calm._)    BLUE HOSE (_very nervous_). Which door? Which door?    YELLOW HOSE. The big one, idiot. Be still!    (_The sound of trumpets increases, and cries of \"Make way for the  King.\" Two_ HERALDS _come in and stand on either side of the door.  The_ KING OF HEARTS _enters, followed by ladies and gentlemen of  the court._ POMPDEBILE _is in full regalia, and very imposing  indeed with his red robe bordered with ermine, his crown and  sceptre. After him comes the_ CHANCELLOR, _an old man with a short,  white beard. The_ KING _strides in a particularly kingly fashion,  pointing his toes in the air at every step, toward his throne,  and sits down. The_ KNAVE _walks behind him slowly. He has a sharp,  pale face._)    POMPDEBILE (_impressively_). Lords and ladies of the court, this is  an important moment in the history of our reign. The Lady  Violetta, whom you love and respect--that is, I mean to say, whom  the ladies love and the lords--er--respect, is about to prove  whether or not she be fitted to hold the exalted position of  Queen of Hearts, according to the law, made a thousand years ago  by Pompdebile the Great, and steadily followed ever since. She  will prepare with her own delicate, white hands a dish of pastry.  This will be judged by the two finest pastry cooks in the land.    (BLUE HOSE _and_ YELLOW HOSE _bow deeply._)    If their verdict be favorable, she shall ride through the streets  of the city on a white palfrey, garlanded with flowers. She will  be crowned, the populace will cheer her, and she will reign by  our side, attending to the domestic affairs of the realm, while  we give our time to weightier matters. This of course you all  understand is a time of great anxiety for the Lady Violetta. She  will appear worried--(_To_ CHANCELLOR) The palfrey is in readiness,  we suppose.    CHANCELLOR. It is, Your Majesty."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#19)"],[1,", skim it clean; then put in a quarter of an Ounce of Mace; so  much Ginger; half an Ounce of Nutmegs; Sweet-marjoram, Broad-thyme and  Sweet-Bryar, of all together a handful, and boil them well therein. Then  set it by, till it be throughly cold, and barrel it up, and keep it till it  be ripe.      ANOTHER TO MAKE MEATHE    To every Gallon of water, take a quart of Honey, to every five Gallons, a  handful of Sweet-marjoram, half a handful of Sliced-ginger; boil all these  moderately three quarters of an hour; then let it stand and cool: and  being Lukewarm, put to every five Gallons, about three quarts of Yest, and  let it work a night and a day. Then take off the Yest and strain it into a  Runlet; and when it hath done working: then stop it up, and so let it  remain a month: then drawing out into bottles, put into every bottle two or  three stoned Raisins, and a lump of Loaf-sugar. It may be drunk in two  months.      ANOTHER VERY GOOD WHITE MEATH    Take to every Gallon of water a quart of Honey: boil in it a little  Rose-mary and Sweet-marjoram: but a large quantity of Sweet-bryar-leaves,  and a reasonable proportion of Ginger: boil these in the Liquor, when it is  skimed; and work it in due time with a little barm. Then tun it in a  vessel; and draw it into bottles, after it is sufficiently settled. Whites  of Eggs with the shells beaten together, do clarifie Meath best. If you  will have your Meath cooling, use Violet and Straw-berry-leaves, Agrimony,  Eglantine and the like: adding Borage and Bugloss, and a little Rosemary  and Sweet-Marjoram to give it Vigor.    Tartar makes it work well.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN    Take to three Gallons of Spring-water, one of Honey; first let it gently  melt, then boil for an hour, continually skiming it; then put it into an  earthen or woodden vessel, and when it is little more then Blood-warm, set  it with Ale-yest, and so let it stand twelve hours; then take off the Yest,  and Bottle it. Put in it Limon-peel and Cloves, or what best pleaseth your  taste of Herbs or Spices. Eringo-roots put into it, when it is a boiling,  maketh it much better. So do Clove-gilly-flowers; a quantity of which make  the Meath look like Claret-wine. I observe that Meath requireth some strong  Herbs to make it quick and smart upon the Palate; as Rose-mary, Bay-leaves,  Sage, Thyme, Marjoram, Winter-savory, and such like, which would be too  strong and bitter in Ale or Beer.      TO MAKE WHITE MEATH    Take Rose-mary, Thyme, Sweet-bryar, Peny-royal, and Bays, Water-cresses,  Agrimony, Marsh-mallows, leaves and flowers: Liver-wort, Wood-betony,  Eye-bright, Scabious, of each alike quantity; of the bark of Ash-tree, of  Eringo-roots-green, of each a proportion to the herbs; of wild Angelica,  Ribwort, Sanicle, Roman-worm-wood, of each a proportion, which is, to every  handful of the Herbs above named, a sixteenth part of a handful of these  latter; steep them a night and a day, in a woodden boul of water covered;  the next day boil them very well in another water, till the colour be very  high; Then take another quantity of water, and boil the herbs in it, till  it look green, and so let it boil three or four times, or as long as the  liquor looketh any thing green; then let it stand with these herbs in it a  day and a night.    To every Gallon of this water, put a quart of pure clear honey, the Liquor  being first strained from the herbs. Your Liquor if it be strong enough  will bear an Egg, the breadth of a three pence above water. When you have  put the honey into the Liquor, you must work and Labour it together a  whole day, until the honey be consumed. Then let it stand a whole night  again a clearing. Then put it into a kettle, and let it boil a quarter of  an hour, with the whites and shells of six Eggs; Then strain it clean, and  so let it stand a cooling. Then put it into a barrel, and take Cloves,  Mace, Cinamon, Nutmegs, and beat them together: put them into a linnen bag,  hang it with a thread into the barrel. If you would have it work, that you  may drink of it presently, take the whites of two or three Eggs, a spoonful  of barm, a spoonful of wheat-flower; beat all these together: Let it work,  before you stop it up. Then afterwards stop it well with clay and salt  tempered together, to keep it moist.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    If your honey be tryed, take six Gallons of Milk-warm-water, to one of  honey, and stir it well together ever and anon, and so let it stand for a  day and night, or half a day may serve; then boil it with a gentle fire,  for the space of half an hour or thereabouts, and skim it, still as the  skum ariseth. After it is scummed once or twice, you may put in your herbs,  and spice grosly beaten, one half loose; the other in a bag, which  afterwards may be fastned with a string to the tap-hole, as Pepper, Cloves,  Mace, Ginger and the like; when it is thus boiled, let it stand in the  vessel until it be cooled; then Tun it up into your barrel, and let it work  two or three days, or more before you stop the bung-hole; but in putting up  the boiled liquor into the barrel, reserve the thick grounds back, which  will be settled in the pan or kettle.    If you would have it to drink within two or three months, let it be no  stronger then to bear an Egg to the top of the water. If you would have it  keep six months, or longer, before you drink it, let it bear up the Egg the  breadth of two pence above the water. This is the surer way to proportion  your honey then by measure. And the time of the tryal of the strength is,  when you incorporate the honey and water together, before the boiling of  it.      ANOTHER SORT OF MEATH    Take thirty six Gallons of fountain water (first boiled, &c.) and dissolve  twelve Gallons of Honey in it. Keep them boiling an hour and a half after  they begin to boil, skimming well all the while. It will be an hour upon  the fire before it boil. When it is clear and enough boiled, pour it out  into woodden vessels to cool. When you are ready to Tun it, have four  Gallons of Black-currants, bruise them in a stone mortar, that they may the  more easily part with their juyce to the Liquor. Put them and their juyce  into the barrel, and pour the cool Liquor upon them, so as the vessel be  quite full. Cover the bung with a plate of lead lying loose on, that the  working of the Liquor may lift it up, as it needeth to cast out the filth.  And still as it worketh over, fill it up with fresh Liquor, made in the  same proportion of honey and water. A moneth after it works no longer, stop  up the bung very close.      TO MAKE VERY GOOD METHEGLIN    Take of all sorts of herbs, that you think are good and wholesome, as Balm,  Minth, Fennel, Rosemary, Angelica, Wild-thyme, Hyssop, Agrimony, Burnet,  and such other as you may like; as also some field herbs; But you must not  put in too many, especially Rose-mary or any strong herb. Less then half a  handfull will serve of every sort. Boil your herbs, and strain them out,  and let the Liquor stand till the morrow, and settle; Then take of the  clearest of the Liquor two Gallons and a half to one Gallon of Honey; and  in that proportion take as much of them as you will make, and let it boil  an hour, and in the boiling scum it very clean. Then set it a cooling as  you do Beer; and when it is cold, take some very good Ale-barm, and put it  into the bottom of the Tub you mean the Metheglin shall work in, which pour  into the Tub by little and little, as they do Beer, keeping back the thick  settling, which lieth in the bottome of the vessels, wherein it is cooled.  And when all is put together, cover it with a cloth, and let it work very  near three days. And when you mean to put it up, scum off all the barm  clean, and put it up into your Barrel or Firkin, which you must not stop  very close in four or five days, but let it have a little vent, for it will  work; and when it is close stopped, you must look to it very often, and  have a peg in the top, to give it vent, when you hear it make a noise (as  it will do) or else it will break the barrel. You may also, if you please,  make a bag, and put in good store of sliced Ginger, and some Cloves and  Cinnamon, and boil it in, or put it into the barrel and never boil it. Both  ways are good.    If you will make small Metheglin, you may put five or six Gallons of water  to one of honey. Put in a little Cinnamon and Cloves and boil it well. And  when it is cold, put it up in bottles very close stopped, and the stopples  well tyed on. This will not keep above five or six weeks, but it is very  fine drink.    Make your Metheglin as soon as ever you take your Bees; for if you wash  your combs in the water you boil your herbs in, when it is cold, it will  sweeten much. But you must afterwards strain it through a cloth, or else  there will be much wax.      TO MAKE MEATH    If you will have it to keep a year or two, take six parts of water, and one  of honey; But if you will have it to keep longer, take but four parts of  water to one of honey. Dissolve the honey very well in the water, then boil  it gently, skimming it all the while as the scum riseth, till no more scum  riseth. Then pour it out of the Copper into a fit vessel or vessels to  cool. Then Tun it up in a strong and sweet cask, and let it stand in some  place, where there is some little warmth; (It will do as well without  warmth, but be longer growing ripe) This will make it work. At first a  course foul matter will work over; to which purpose it must be kept always  full with fresh Liquor of the same, as it worketh over. When it begins to  work more gently, and that which riseth at the top, is no more foul, but is  a white froth; then fill and stop it up close, and set it in a cool cellar,  where it is to stand continually.    After half a year or a year, you may draw it off from the Lees into a clean  vessel, or let it remain untouched. It is not fit to be drunk for it's  perfection till the"]]]
