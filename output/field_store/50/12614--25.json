The result was rather encouraging. My mother and sister were both  satisfied. At any rate, they said nothing to the contrary. Being only in  my nineteenth year, what might I not be able to accomplish after a little  more experience!    How little did I think, while rehearsing before my mother and sister, that  anything serious would ever come of it, or that I was laying the  foundations of character for life, or that I was beginning what I should  not be able to finish within the next forty or fifty years following. Yet  so it was. I had broken the ice without knowing it. These things were but  the foreshadowing of what happened long afterward.

ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD. (108)    Thomas Gray, 1716-1771, is often spoken of as \"the author of the  Elegy,\"--this simple yet highly finished and beautiful poem being by far  the best known of an his writings. It was finished in 1749,--seven years  from the time it was commenced. Probably no short poem in the language  ever deserved or received more praise. Gray was born in London; his father  possessed property, but was indolent and selfish; his mother was a  successful woman of business, and supported her son in college from her  own earnings. The poet was educated at Eton and Cambridge; at the latter  place, he resided for several years after his return from a continental  tour, begun in 1739. He was small and delicate in person, refined and  precise in dress and manners, and shy and retiring in disposition. He was  an accomplished scholar in many fields of learning, but left comparatively  little finished work in any department. He declined the honor of poet  laureate; but, in 1769, was appointed Professor of History at Cambridge.  ###      The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,    The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,  The plowman homeward plods his weary way,    And leaves the world to darkness and to me.    Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,    And all the air a solemn stillness holds,  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,    And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:    Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,    The moping owl does to the moon complain  Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,    Molest her ancient solitary reign.    Beneath those rugged elms, that yew tree's shade,    Where heaves the turf in many a moldering heap,  Each in his narrow cell forever laid,    The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.    The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,    The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,  The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,    No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.    For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,    Or busy housewife ply her evening care;  No children run to lisp their sire's return,    Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.    Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,    Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:  How jocund did they drive their team afield!    How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!    Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,    Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile    The short and simple annals of the poor.    The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,    And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,  Await alike, the inevitable hour:    The paths of glory lead but to the grave.    Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,    If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise;  Where, through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,    The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.    Can storied urn, or animated bust,    Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?  Can Honor's voice provoke the silent dust,    Or Flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of Death?    Perhaps, in this neglected spot is laid    Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;  Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,    Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:    But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,    Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;  Chill Penury repressed their noble rage,    And froze the genial current of the soul.    Full many a gem of purest ray serene,    The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear:  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,    And waste its sweetness on the desert air.    Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,    The little tyrant of his fields withstood,  Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest,    Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.    The applause of listening senates to command,    The threats of pain and ruin to despise,  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,    And read their history in a nation's eyes,    Their lot forbade: nor, circumscribed alone    Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;  Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne.    And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,    The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,    To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,  Or heap the shrine of luxury and pride,    With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.    Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,    Their sober wishes never learned to stray;  Along the cool, sequestered vale of life,    They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.    Yet even these bones, from insult to protect,    Some frail memorial still, erected nigh,  With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked,    Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.    Their name, their years, spelt by the unlettered Muse,    The place of fame and elegy supply;  And many a holy text around she strews,    That teach the rustic moralist to die.    For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,    This pleasing, anxious being e'er resigned,  Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,    Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?    On some fond breast the parting soul relies,    Some pious drops the closing eye requires;  E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,    E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.    For thee, who, mindful of the unhonored dead,    Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,  If chance, by lonely contemplation led,    Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,--    Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,    \"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  Brushing, with hasty step, the dews away,    To meet the sun upon the upland lawn:    \"There, at the foot of yonder nodding beech,    That wreathes its old, fantastic roots so high,  His listless length at noontide would he stretch,    And pore upon the brook that babbles by.    \"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,    Muttering his wayward fancies, he would rove;  Now, drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,    Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.    \"One morn, I missed him on the customed hill,    Along the heath, and near his favorite tree:  Another came; nor yet beside the rill,    Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he:    \"The next, with dirges due, in sad array    Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne:--  Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay    'Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\"               THE EPITAPH.    Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth,    A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown:  Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth,    And Melancholy marked him for her own.    Large was his bounty and his soul sincere,    Heaven did a recompense as largely send:  He gave to Misery (all he had) a tear;    He gained from Heaven ('t was all he wished) a friend.    No farther seek his merits to disclose,    Or draw his frailties from their dread abode  (There they alike in trembling hope repose),    The bosom of his Father, and his God.

Oliver Cromwell (b. 1599, d. 1658) was the leading character in the Great  Rebellion in England. He was Lord Protector the last five years of his  life, and in many respects the ablest ruler that England ever had.        XVIII. TACT AND TALENT. (113)    Talent is something, but tact is everything. Talent is serious, sober,  grave, and respectable: tact is all that, and more too. It is not a sixth  sense, but it is the life of all the five. It is the open eye, the quick  ear, the judging taste, the keen smell, and the lively touch; it is the  interpreter of all riddles, the surmounter of all difficulties, the  remover of all obstacles. It is useful in all places, and at all times; it  is useful in solitude, for it shows a man into the world; it is useful in  society, for it shows him his way through the world.    Talent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is momentum; talent  knows what to do, tact knows how to do it; talent makes a man respectable,  tact "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#19)"],[1,"lae, mottling, or in short, any other phenomena that may  then be existing on the disc.\" \"Drifting clouds frequently sweep by, to  vary the scene, and occasionally an aerial hail- or snow-storm.\" Mr.  Howlett has more than once seen a distant flight of rooks pass slowly  across the disc with wonderful distinctness, when the sun has been at a  low altitude, and likewise, much more frequently, the rapid dash of  starlings, which, very much closer at hand, frequent his church-tower.\"    An eclipse of the sun, or a transit of an inferior planet, is also much  better seen in this way than by any other method of observing the solar  disc. In Plate 7 are presented several solar spots as they have appeared  to Mr. Howlett, with an instrument of moderate power. The grotesque  forms of some of these are remarkable; and the variations the spots  undergo from day to day are particularly interesting to the thoughtful  observer.    A method of measuring the spots may now be described. It is not likely  indeed that the ordinary observer will care to enter upon any systematic  series of measurements. But even in his case, the means of forming a  general comparison between the spots he sees at different times cannot  fail to be valuable. Also the knowledge--which a simple method of  measurement supplies--of the actual dimensions of a spot in miles  (roughly) is calculated to enhance our estimate of the importance of  these features of the solar disc. I give Mr. Howlett's method in his own  words:--    \"Cause your optician to rule for you on a circular piece of glass a  number of fine graduations, the 200th part of an inch apart, each fifth  and tenth line being of a different length in order to assist the eye in  their enumeration. Insert this between the anterior and posterior lenses  of a Huygenian eye-piece of moderate power, say 80 linear. Direct your  telescope upon the sun, and having so arranged it that the whole disc of  the sun may be projected on the screen, count carefully the number of  graduations that are seen to exactly occupy the solar diameter.... It  matters not in which direction you measure your diameter, provided only  the sun has risen some 18 deg. or 20 deg. above the horizon, and so escaped the  distortion occasioned by refraction.[16]    \"Next let us suppose that our observer has been observing the sun on any  day of the year, say, if you choose, at the time of its mean apparent  diameter, namely about the first of April or first of October, and has  ascertained that\" (as is the case with Mr. Howlett's instrument)  \"sixty-four graduations occupy the diameter of the projected image. Now  the semi-diameter of the sun, at the epochs above mentioned, according  to the tables given for every day of the year in the 'Nautical Almanac'  (the same as in Dietrichsen and Hannay's very useful compilation) is  16' 2\", and consequently his mean total diameter is 32' 4\" or 1924\". If  now we divide 1924\" by 64\" this will, of course, award as nearly as  possible 30\" as the value in celestial arc of each graduation, either as  seen on the screen, or as applied directly to the sun or any heavenly  body large enough to be measured by it.\"    Since the sun's diameter is about 850,000 miles, each graduation (in the  case above specified) corresponds to one-64th part of 850,000  miles--that is, to a length of 13,256 miles on the sun's surface. Any  other case can be treated in precisely the same manner.    It will be found easy so to place the screen that the distance between  successive graduations (as seen projected upon the screen) may  correspond to any desired unit of linear measurement--say an inch. Then  if the observer use transparent tracing-paper ruled with faint lines  forming squares half-an-inch in size, he can comfortably copy directly  from the screen any solar phenomena he may be struck with. A variety of  methods of drawing will suggest themselves. Mr. Howlett, in the paper I  have quoted from above, describes a very satisfactory method, which  those who are anxious to devote themselves seriously to solar  observation will do well to study.    It is necessary that the observer should be able to determine  approximately where the sun's equator is situated at the time of any  observation, in order that he may assign to any spot or set of spots its  true position in relation to solar longitude and latitude. Mr. Howlett  shows how this may be done by three observations of the sun made at any  fixed hour on successive days. Perhaps the following method will serve  the purpose of the general observer sufficiently well:--    The hour at which the sun crosses the meridian must be taken for the  special observation now to be described. This hour can always be learnt  from 'Dietrichsen's Almanac'; but noon, civil time, is near enough for  practical purposes. Now it is necessary first to know the position of  the ecliptic with reference to the celestial equator. Of course, at noon  a horizontal line across the sun's disc is parallel to the equator, but  the position of that diameter of the sun which coincides with the  ecliptic is not constant: at the summer and winter solstices this  diameter coincides with the other, or is horizontal at noon; at the  spring equinox the sun (which travels on the ecliptic) is passing  towards the north of the equator, crossing that curve at an angle of  23-1/2 deg., so that the ecliptic coincides with that diameter of the sun  which cuts the horizontal one at an angle of 23-1/2 deg. and has its _left_  end above the horizontal diameter; and at the autumn equinox the sun is  descending and the same description applies, only that the diameter  (inclined 23-1/2 deg. to the horizon) which has its _right_ end uppermost,  now represents the ecliptic. For intermediate dates, use the following  little table:--    --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Date.              |Dec. 22|Jan. 5|Jan. 20|Feb. 4|Feb. 19|Mar. 5 |Mar. 21  (Circiter.)        |       |June 6|May 21 |May 5 |Apr. 20|Apr. 5 |  -------------------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+-------+--------  Inclination of     |Left   |Left  |Left   |Left  |Left   |Left   |Left  Ecliptical Diameter|       |      |       |      |       |       |  of Sun to the      |0 deg. 0'  |6 deg.24' |12 deg.14' |17 deg.3' |20 deg.36' |22 deg.44' |23 deg.27'  Horizon.[17]       |Right  |Right |Right  |Right |Right  |Right  |Right  -------------------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+-------+--------  Date.              |       |Dec. 7|Nov. 22|Nov. 7|Oct. 23|Oct. 8 |  (Circiter.)        |Jan. 21|July 7|July 23|Aug. 6|Aug. 23|Sept. 7|Sept. 23  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    Now if our observer describe a circle, and draw a diameter inclined  according to above table, this diameter would represent the sun's  equator if the axis of the sun were square to the ecliptic-plane. But  this axis is slightly inclined, the effect of which is, that on or about  June 10 the sun is situated as shown in fig. 14 with respect to the  ecliptic _ab_; on or about September 11 he is situated as shown in fig.  13; on or about December 11 as shown in fig. 12; and on or about March  10 as shown in fig. 15. The inclination of his equator to the ecliptic  being so small, the student can find little difficulty in determining  with sufficient approximation the relation of the sun's polar axis to  the ecliptic on intermediate days, since the equator is never more  _inclined_ than in figs. 12 and 14, never more _opened out_ than in  figs. 13 and 15. Having then drawn a line to represent the sun's  ecliptical diameter inclined to the horizontal diameter as above  described, and having (with this line to correspond to _ab_ in figs.  12-15) drawn in the sun's equator suitably inclined and opened out, he  has the sun's actual presentation (at noon) as seen with an erecting  eye-piece. Holding his picture upside down, he has the sun's  presentation as seen with an astronomical eye-piece--and, finally,  looking at his picture from behind (without inverting it), he has the  presentation seen when the sun is projected on the screen. Hence, if he  make a copy of this last view of his diagram upon the centre of his  screen, and using a low power, bring the whole of the sun's image to  coincide with the circle thus drawn (to a suitable scale) on the screen,  he will at once see what is the true position of the different  sun-spots. After a little practice the construction of a suitably sized  and marked circle on the screen will not occupy more than a minute or  two.    [Illustration: _Fig. 12._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 13._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 14._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 15._]    It must be noticed that the sun's apparent diameter is not always the  same. He is nearer to us in winter than in summer, and, of course, his  apparent diameter is greater at the former than at the latter season.  The variation of the apparent diameter corresponds (inversely) to the  variation of distance. As the sun's greatest distance from the earth is  93,000,000 miles (pretty nearly) and his least 90,000,000, his greatest,  mean, and least apparent diameters are as 93, 91-1/2, and 90  respectively; that is, as 62, 61, and 60 respectively.    Mr. Howlett considers that with a good 3-inch telescope, applied in the  manner we have described, all the solar features may be seen, except the  separate granules disclosed by first-class instruments in the hands of  such observers as Dawes, Huggins, or Secchi. Faculae may, of course, be  well seen. They are to be looked for near spots which lie close to the  sun's limb.    When the sun's general surface is carefully scrutinised, it is found to  present a mottled appearance. This is a somewhat delicate feature. It  results, undoubtedly, from the combined effect of the granules  separately seen in powerful instruments. Sir John Herschel has stated  that he cannot recognise the "]]]
