When they had all passed, he came out of his camp and followed them as  far as Aquae Sextiae, now called Aix, where one of the most terrible  battles the world ever saw was fought. These people were a whole  tribe--wives, children, and everything they had with them--and to be  defeated was utter and absolute ruin. A great enclosure was made with  their carts and wagons, whence the women threw arrows and darts to help  the men; and when, after three days of hard fighting, all hope was over,  they set fire to the enclosure and killed their children and themselves.  The whole swarm was destroyed. Marius marched away, and no one was left  to bury the dead, so that the spot was called the Putrid Fields, and is  still known as Les Pourrieres.    [Illustration: ONE OF THE TROPHIES, CALLED OF MARIUS, AT THE CAPITOL AT  ROME.]    While Marius was offering up the spoil, tidings came that he was a fifth  time chosen consul; but he had to hasten into Italy, for the other  consul, Catulus, could not stand before the Cimbri, and Marius met him  on the Po retreating from them. The Cimbri demanded lands in Italy for  themselves and their allies the Teutones. \"The Teutones have all the  ground they will ever want, on the other side the Alps,\" said Marius;  and a terrible battle followed, in which the Cimbri were as entirely cut  off as their allies had been.    Marius was made consul a sixth time. As a reward to the brave soldiers  who had fought under him, he made one thousand of them, who came from  the city of Camerinum, Roman citizens, and this the patricians disliked  greatly. His excuse was, \"The din of arms drowned the voice of the law;\"  but the new citizens were provided for by lands in the Province, which  the Romans said the Gauls had lost to the Teutones and they had  reconquered. It was very hard on the Gauls, but that was the last thing  a Roman cared about.    The Italians, however, were all crying out for the rights of Romans, and  the more far-sighted among the Romans would, like Caius Gracchus, have  granted them. Marcus Livius Drusus did his best for them; he was a good  man, wise and frank-hearted. When he was having a house built, and the  plan was shown him which would make it impossible for any one to see  into it, he said, \"Rather build one where my fellow-countrymen may see  all I do.\" He was very much loved, and when he was ill, prayers were  offered at the temples for his recovery; but no sooner did he take up  the cause of the Italians than all the patricians hated him bitterly.  \"Rome for the Romans,\" was their watchword. Drusus was one day  entertaining an Italian gentleman, when his little nephew, Marcus  Porcius Cato, a descendant of the old censor, and bred in stern  patrician views, was playing about the room. The Italian merrily asked  him to favor his cause. \"No,\" said the boy. He was offered toys and  cakes if he would change his mind, but he still refused; he was  threatened, and at last he was held by one leg out of the window--all  without shaking his resolution for a moment; and this constancy he  carried with him through life.    People's minds grew embittered, and Drusus was murdered in the street,  crying as he fell, \"When will Rome find so good a citizen!\" After this,  the Italians took up arms, and what was called the Social War began.  Marius had no high command, being probably too much connected with the  enemy. Some of the Italian tribes held with Rome, and these were  rewarded with the citizenship; and after all, though the consul Lucius  Julius Caesar, brother-in-law to Marius, gained some victories, the  revolt was so widespread, that the Senate felt it wisest, on the first  sign of peace, to offer citizenship to such Italians as would come  within sixty days to claim it. Citizenship brought a man under Roman  law, freed him from taxation, and gave him many advantages and openings  to a rise in life. But he could only give his vote at Rome, and only  there receive the distribution of corn, and he further became liable to  be called out to serve in a legion, so that the benefit was not so great  as at first appeared, and no very large numbers of Italians came to  apply for it.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XXIV.    THE ADVENTURES OF MARIUS.    93--84.      The chief foe of Marius was almost always his second in command, Publius  Cornelius Sulla, one of the men of highest family in Rome. He had all  the high culture and elegant learning that the rough soldier Marius  despised, spoke and wrote Greek as easily as Latin, and was as well read  in Greek poetry and philosophy as any Athenian could be; but he was  given up to all the excesses of luxury in which the wealthy Romans  indulged, and his way of life had made him frightful to look at. His  face was said to be like a mulberry sprinkled with salt, with a terrible  pair of blue eyes glaring out of it.    In 93 he was sent to command against Mithridates, king of Pontus, one  of the little kingdoms in Asia Minor that had sprung up out of the  break-up of Alexander's empire. Under this king, Mithridates, it had  grown very powerful. He was of Persian birth, had all the learning and  science both of Greece and the far East, and was said in especial to be  wonderfully learned in all plants and their virtues, so as to have made  himself proof against all kinds of poison, and he could speak  twenty-five languages.    He had great power in Asia Minor, and took upon himself to appoint a  king of Cappadocia, thus leading to a quarrel with the Romans. In the  midst of the Social War, when he thought they had their hands full in  Italy, Mithridates caused all the native inhabitants of Asia Minor to  rise upon the Romans among them in one night and murder them all, so  that 80,000 are said to have perished. Sulla was ordered to take the  command of the army which was to avenge their death; but, while he was  raising his forces, Marius, angry that the patricians had hindered the  plebeians and Italians from gaining more by the Social War, raised up a  great tumult, meaning to overpower the patricians' resistance. He would  have done more wisely had he waited until Sulla was quite gone, for that  general came back to the rescue of his friends with six newly-raised  legions, and Marius could only just contrive to escape from Rome, where  he was proclaimed a traitor and a price set on his head. He was now  seventy years old, but full of spirit. First he escaped to his own farm,  whence he hoped to reach Ostia, where a ship was waiting for him; but a  party of horsemen were seen coming, and he was hidden in a cart full of  beans and driven down the coast, where he embarked, meaning to go to  Africa; but adverse winds and want of food forced him to land at  Circaeum, whence, with a few friends, he made his way along the coast,  through woods and rocks, keeping up the spirits of his companions by  telling them that, when a little boy, he robbed an eyrie of seven  eaglets, and that a soothsayer had then foretold that he would be seven  times consul. At last a troop of horse was seen coming towards them, and  at the same time two ships near the coast. The only hope was in swimming  out to the nearest ship, and Marius was so heavy and old that this was  done with great difficulty. Even then the ships were so near the shore  that the pursuers could command the crew to throw Marius out, but this  they refused to do, though they only waited till the soldiers were gone,  to put him on shore again. Here he was in a marshy, boggy place, where  an old man let him rest in his cottage, and then hid him in a cave under  a heap of rushes. Again, however, the troops appeared, and threatened  the old man for hiding an enemy of the Romans. It was in Marius'  hearing, and fearing to be betrayed, he rushed out into a pool, where he  stood up to his neck in water till a soldier saw him, and he was dragged  out and taken to the city of Minturnae.    [Illustration: THE CATAPULT.]    There the council decided on his death, and sent a soldier to kill him,  but the fierce old man stood glaring at him, and said. \"Darest thou  kill Caius Marius?\" The man was so frightened that he ran away, crying  out, \"I cannot kill Caius Marius.\" The Senate of Minturnae took this as  an omen, and remembered besides that he had been a good friend to the  Italians, so they conducted him through a sacred grove to the sea, and  sent him off to Africa. On landing, he sent his son to ask shelter from  one of the Numidian princes, and, while waiting for an answer, he was  harassed by a messenger from a Roman officer of low rank, forbidding his  presence in Africa. He made no reply till the messenger pressed to know  what to say to his master. Then the old man looked up, and sternly  answered. \"Say that you have seen Caius Marius sitting in the ruins of  Carthage\"--a grand rebuke for the insult to fallen greatness. But the  Numidian could not receive him, and he could only find shelter in a  little island on the coast.    There he soon heard that no sooner had Sulla embarked for the East than  Rome had fallen into dire confusion. The consuls, Caius Octavius and  Publius Cornelius Cinna, were of opposite parties, and had a furious  fight, in which Cinna was driven out of Rome, and at the same time the  Italians had begun a new Social War. Marius saw that his time was come.  He hurried to Etruria, where he was joined by a party of his friends and  five hundred runaway slaves. The discontented Romans formed another army  under Quintus Sertorius, and the Samnites, who had begun the war,  overpowered the troops sent against them, and marched to Rome, declaring  they would have no peace till they had destroyed the wolf's lair. Cinna  and an army were advancing on another side, and, as he was really  consul, the Senate in their distress admitted him, hoping that he would  stop the rest; but when he marched in and seated himself again in the  chair of office, he had by his side old Marius"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#19)"],[1,"granitic hills jutting  above the plains (if such they may be called) which are all ups and  downs, and furrowed with innumerable running rills, the sources of the  Rovuma and Loendi. The highest rock observed with mica schist was at  an altitude of 3440 feet. The same uneven country prevails as we  proceed from the watershed about forty miles down to the Lake, and a  great deal of quartz in small fragments renders travelling-very  difficult. Near the Lake, and along its eastern shore, we have mica  schist and gneiss foliated, with a great deal of hornblende; but the  most remarkable feature of it is that the rocks are all tilted on  edge, or slightly inclined to the Lake. The active agent in effecting  this is not visible. It looks as if a sudden rent had been made, so as  to form the Lake, and tilt all these rocks nearly over. On the east  side of the lower part of the Lake we have two ranges of mountains,  evidently granitic: the nearer one covered with small trees and lower  than the other; the other jagged and bare, or of the granitic forms.  But in all this country no fossil-yielding rock was visible except the  grey sandstone referred to at the beginning of this note. The rocks  are chiefly the old crystalline forms.    One fine straight tall tree in the hollows seemed a species of fig:  its fruit was just forming, but it was too high for me to ascertain  its species. The natives don't eat the fruit, but they eat the large  grubs which come out of it. The leaves were fifteen inches long by  five broad: they call it Unguengo.    _29th July, 1866._--At Magola's village. Although we are now rid of  the sepoys, we cannot yet congratulate ourselves on being rid of the  lazy habits of lying down in the path which they introduced. A strong  scud comes up from the south bringing much moisture with it: it blows  so hard above, this may be a storm on the coast. Temperature in  mornings 55 deg.    _30th July, 1866._--A short march brought us to Pezimba's village,  which consists of 200 houses and huts. It is placed very nicely on a  knoll between two burns, which, as usual, are made use of for  irrigating peas in winter time. The headman said that if we left now  we had a good piece of jungle before us, and would sleep twice in it  before reaching Mbanga. We therefore remained. An Arab party, hearing  of our approach, took a circuitous route among the mountains to avoid  coming in contact with us. In travelling to Pezimba's we had commenced  our western descent to the Lake, for we were now lower than Magola's  by 300 feet. We crossed many rivulets and the Lochesi, a good-sized  stream. The watershed parts some streams for Loendi and some for  Rovuma. There is now a decided scantiness of trees. Many of the  hill-tops are covered with grass or another plant; there is pleasure  now in seeing them bare. Ferns, rhododendrons, and a foliaged tree,  which looks in the distance like silver-fir, are met with.    The Mandare root is here called Nyumbo, when cooked it has a slight  degree of bitterness with it which cultivation may remove. Mica schist  crowned some of the heights on the watershed, then gneiss, and now, as  we descend further, we have igneous rocks of more recent eruption,  porphyry and gneiss, with hornblende. A good deal of ferruginous  conglomerate, with holes in it, covers many spots; when broken, it  looks like yellow haematite, with black linings to the holes: this is  probably the ore used in former times by the smiths, of whose  existence we now find still more evidence than further east.    _31st July, 1866._--I had presented Pezimba with a cloth, so he cooked  for us handsomely last night, and this morning desired us to wait a  little as he had not yet sufficient meal made to present: we waited  and got a generous present.    It was decidedly milder here than at Mataka's, and we had a clear sky.  In our morning's march we passed the last of the population, and went  on through a fine well-watered fruitful country, to sleep near a  mountain called Mtewire, by a stream called Msapo. A very large Arab  slave-party was close by our encampment, and I wished to speak to  them; but as soon as they knew of our being near they set off in a  pathless course across country, and were six days in the  wilderness.[17]    _1st August, 1866._--We saw the encampment of another Arab party. It  consisted of ten pens, each of which, from the number of fires it  contained, may have held from eighty to a hundred slaves. The people  of the country magnified the numbers, saying that they would reach  from this to Mataka's; but from all I can learn, I think that from 300  to 800 slaves is the commoner gang. This second party went across  country very early this morning. We saw the fire-sticks which the  slaves had borne with them. The fear they feel is altogether the  effect of the English name, for we have done nothing to cause their  alarm.    _2nd August, 1866._--There was something very cheering to me in the  sight at our encampment of yellow grass and trees dotted over it, as  in the Bechuana country. The birds were singing merrily too, inspired  by the cold, which was 47 deg., and by the vicinity of some population.  Gum-copal trees and bushes grow here as well as all over the country;  but gum is never dug for, probably because the trees were never large  enough to yield the fossil gum. Marks of smiths are very abundant and  some furnaces are still standing. Much cultivation must formerly have  been where now all is jungle.    We arrived at Mbanga, a village embowered in trees, chiefly of the  euphorbia, so common in the Manganja country further south. Kandulo,  the headman, had gone to drink beer at another village, but sent  orders to give a hut and to cook for us. We remained next day. Took  lunars.    We had now passed through, at the narrowest part, the hundred miles of  depopulated country, of which about seventy are on the N.E. of Mataka.  The native accounts differ as to the cause. Some say slave wars, and  assert that the Makoa from the vicinity of Mozambique played an  important part in them; others say famine; others that the people have  moved to and beyond Nyassa.[18] Certain it is, from the potsherds  strewed over the country, and the still remaining ridges on which  beans, sorghum, maize, and cassava, were planted, that the departed  population was prodigious. The Waiyau, who are now in the country,  came from the other side of the Rovuma, and they probably supplanted  the Manganja, an operation which we see going on at the present day.    _4th August, 1866._--An hour and a half brought us to Miule, a village  on the same level with Mbanga; and the chief pressing us to stay, on  the plea of our sleeping two nights in the jungle, instead of one if  we left early next morning, we consented. I asked him what had become  of the very large iron-smelting population of this region; he said  many had died of famine, others had fled to the west of Nyassa: the  famine is the usual effect of slave wars, and much death is thereby  caused--probably much more than by the journey to the coast. He had  never heard any tradition of stone hatchets having been used, nor of  stone spear-heads or arrowheads of that material, nor had he heard of  any being turned up by the women in hoeing. The Makonde, as we saw,  use wooden spears where iron is scarce. I saw wooden hoes used for  tilling the soil in the Bechuana and Bataka countries, but never stone  ones. In 1841 I saw a Bushwoman in the Cape Colony with a round stone  and a hole through it; on being asked she showed me how it was used by  inserting the top of a digging-stick into it, and digging a root. The  stone was to give the stick weight.    [Illustration.]    The stones still used as anvils and sledge-hammers by many of the  African smiths, when considered from their point of view, show sounder  sense than if they were burdened with the great weights we use. They  are unacquainted with the process of case-hardening, which, applied to  certain parts of our anvils, gives them their usefulness, and an anvil  of their soft iron would not do so well as a hard stone. It is true a  small light one might be made, but let any one see how the hammers of  their iron bevel over and round in the faces with a little work, and  he will perceive that only a wild freak would induce any sensible  native smith to make a mass equal to a sledge-hammer, and burden  himself with a weight for what can be better performed by a stone. If  people are settled, as on the coast, then they gladly use any mass of  cast iron they may find, but never where, as in the interior, they  have no certainty of remaining any length of time in one spot.    _5th August, 1866._--We left Miule, and commenced our march towards  Lake Nyassa, and slept at the last of the streams that flow to the  Loendi. In Mataka's vicinity, N.E., there is a perfect brush of  streams flowing to that river: one forms a lake in its course, and the  sources of the Rovuma lie in the same region. After leaving Mataka's  we crossed a good-sized one flowing to Loendi, and, the day after  leaving Pezimba's, another going to the Chiringa or Lochiringa, which  is a tributary of the Rovuma.    _6th August, 1866._--We passed two cairns this morning at the  beginning of the very sensible descent to the Lake. They are very  common in all this Southern Africa in the passes of the mountains, and  are meant to mark divisions of countries, perhaps burial-places, but  the Waiyau who accompanied us thought that they were merely heaps of  stone collected by some one making a garden. The cairns were placed  just about the spot where the blue waters of Nyassa first came fairly  into view.    We now came upon a stream, the Misinje, flowing into the Lake, and we  crossed it five times; it was about twenty yards wide, and thigh deep.  We made but short stages when we got on the lower plateau, for the  people had great abundance of food, and gave"]]]
