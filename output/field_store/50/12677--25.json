These must have been sorrowful processions, especially the last of the  two. For months they had suffered the horrors of a besieged city. Then  had come the break in the walls, the screams of frightened women and  children, the heaps of corpses in the streets, and the black smoke and  red glare of burning buildings; then the hasty setting out on the long  road to Babylon. Some of them perhaps were able to buy asses to carry  the little children and a few of their belongings. But most of them  had to trudge along on foot, fathers and mothers carrying the babies,  and leaving behind them all their possessions except what could be  gathered into a towel or a blanket. For a month or six weeks they  tramped. If anyone fell sick, there was no time to take care of him.  He must drag along with the rest or fall by the wayside until he  either recovered or died.      THE SETTLEMENT IN BABYLONIA    When they reached the land of their captors they were not made slaves,  but were allowed to make their home together in settlements on land  set apart for them. In these colonies they probably worked as  tenant-farmers on the estates of Nebuchadrezzar's nobles. In the  prophetic book of Ezekiel, who was among these exiles, we read about  one of these Jewish colonies by the river, or canal, called Chebar (or  in Babylonian Kabaru), which means the Grand Canal.    =The attractions of Babylonian life.=--What the Babylonians hoped was  that these people would forget that they were Hebrews and become  Babylonians, just as immigrants from Europe become Americans. This is  exactly what happened in many cases. At first, of course, the Hebrews  were bitterly homesick. The land of Babylonia was as flat as a floor.  The Hebrews longed for the lovely hills and valleys of their native  land.        =By the rivers of Babylon,      There we sat down, yea, we wept,      When we remembered Zion.      Upon the willows in the midst thereof      We hanged up our harps,      For there they that led us captive required of us songs,      And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,      Sing us one of the songs of Zion.      How shall we sing the Lord's song      In a strange land?=    But the years went by, and they had time to look about in the new  country. They found it full of opportunities for money-making. The  soil, watered by hundreds of canals from the Euphrates and Tigris  Rivers, was wonderfully rich. Everywhere there were prosperous towns  and cities with great brick buildings, beautifully decorated with  sculpture, and thronged with merchants. Ships laden with wheat and  dates and with Babylonian rugs and mantles and other beautiful  articles sailed up the rivers, or out to sea toward India. Many  Hebrews, or Jews (that is, Hebrews from Judaea), became merchants. In  their own land they had been chiefly a nation of farmers. The  reputation of the Jews for cleverness in trade began with these  experiences in Babylon when hundreds of Jewish boys obtained positions  in great Babylonian stores or banks, and by and by set up for  themselves as merchants. Among the Babylonian contracts on clay  tablets coming down to us from this period are many Jewish names.      THE TEMPTATION TO FORSAKE JEHOVAH    These young Hebrew merchants found themselves in a net-work of foreign  religious customs. When a customer signed a contract it was proposed  that he offer a sacrifice to the god Marduk, that the enterprise might  prosper. There were religious processions and feast days in which  everyone joined, just as we hang out flags on the Fourth of July.  Foreigners from other lands joined in these rites and thought nothing  of it. Furthermore, some of these captive Jews thought that their  Hebrew God, Jehovah, had not protected them from these mighty  Babylonians. Surely, the Babylonian gods were the stronger, and one  should pay them due reverence.    =Memories of the prophets.=--On the other hand, even the dullest of  the Jews must have begun to understand that the religion of their  prophets was a different kind of religion altogether--not _a_  religion, but _true_ religion; and that Jehovah was not like the  bargaining, jealous gods of the other nations, but was God, with a  capital G, the one righteous Creator and Ruler of the world.    Moreover, the prophets who had taught them to think of Jehovah in this  way had again and again declared that just this calamity of exile  would come upon them if they as a nation continued to disobey  Jehovah's just laws; and what they had foretold had come to pass. The  prophets must have been right. Their teaching must be true.    =Hebrews in other foreign lands.=--There were probably almost as many  Hebrews in Egypt at this time as in Babylonia. Indeed, even before the  destruction of Jerusalem the constant wars on Canaan had compelled  great numbers of them to seek for peace and comfort for themselves and  their wives and children in Egypt, in Damascus, and even in far-away  Carthage and Greece. The Jews to-day are scattered all over the world.  This began to be true of them from the time of the destruction of  Jerusalem.    These Jews who permanently made their homes in foreign countries were  called _Jews of the Dispersion_. And they all faced the same  temptations as the exiles in Babylonia. Their problem was how to be  loyal to their nation and their religion. Great numbers of them, like  Daniel and his friends in the stories related in the book of Daniel,  did refuse to sacrifice to heathen gods and held fast to the nobler  faith which they had brought with them from Jerusalem. This was not  easy. Not only were they tempted to go with the crowd and worship the  gods of the land; they were also uncertain just how to worship  Jehovah. They could not offer sacrifices to him. Jerusalem was a  thousand miles away, and the temple there was burned. Should they  build a new temple for him, in Babylon? It was not certain whether  that would be lawful. The Jews in Egypt did build a temple to Jehovah.  But no others seem to have been able to do this.      KEEPING THE SABBATH    There were some religious customs, however, which could more easily be  transplanted. One was the Sabbath Day. In the earlier centuries the  Hebrews had observed the day of the new moon with special sacrifices,  and also, to some extent, the other days when the moon passed from  full to first quarter, then to the second, then to the third--in other  words, every seventh day. There was in the days before Moses no  thought of resting from labor on these days, except as might have been  necessary in order to offer up the special sacrifices.    =The Sabbath and the new law of Deuteronomy.=--One of the kindly  changes which the new law of Deuteronomy introduced was to make the  Sabbath a rest day for slaves and all toilers. On the Sabbath \"thou  shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy  manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, ... that  thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.\"    In Babylonia and other foreign lands faithful Jews were especially  careful to keep the Sabbath by resting from all their work. No one  else did so, and the custom marked them as Jews. When a Babylonian  would propose to buy a wagon load of wheat on the Sabbath the Jew  would say, \"I cannot sell on that day; it is a Sabbath day to our  God.\" Boys and girls were not allowed to play with their Babylonian  playmates on the Sabbath. Such experiences helped them to remember  that they were Jews. They thought of it also as an act of respect to  Jehovah. It took the place of animal sacrifices. As the time went on  there grew up rules and regulations in regard to Sabbath-keeping which  became more and more strict and elaborate.      PRAYER AND PUBLIC WORSHIP    Another religious custom which can be practiced anywhere is prayer. It  must have been a great and happy discovery to many a homesick Jew when  he found that even though the temple at Jerusalem was far away, yet in  his own room \"by the river Chebar\" he could kneel, or even in the  street he could for a moment close his eyes and breathe out a prayer  to God and find in it fresh strength and hope and courage.    =The synagogue.=--The weekly Sabbath rest also made it possible for  the Jews to meet together on that day for prayer and worship together.  The reading circles which Isaiah had organized, and out of which  probably came the law-book Deuteronomy, were continued in Babylonia,  and the Sabbath morning, afternoon, or evening was a convenient time  of meeting. They would gather in some private house and study the law  and the writings of the prophets. Then they would pray. Those who were  the most learned would read and they and others would pray aloud.    By and by special buildings were set apart called synagogues. As time  went on these synagogue services rather than the services in the  temple, became the most important part of the Jewish religion. Our  morning and evening worship in the Christian Church grew out of the  synagogue service. It was the beginning of that worship of which Jesus  spoke when he said: The hour cometh when neither in this mountain, nor  in Jerusalem shall ye worship the Father.... But ... the true  worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Read 2 Kings 25, or Daniel 1.    2. Mention some other temptations which must have come to the Jews, in  Babylon, besides the temptation to worship idols. Consider, for  example, their new experiences as traders.    3. What are some good ways in which we may be helped to be true to God  to-day when we are away from home.          CHAPTER XXII    UNDYING HOPES OF THE JEWS      As the Jewish exiles were led away to Babylon they asked themselves  over and over again, \"Is this the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#19)"],[1," a canoe, and all the dry  clothes and blankets had just been fished out of the river. Now the  lazy man stood before the fire, looking after his own comfort. The  other three worked like beavers, making camp. They were in ill humor,  cold, wet, hungry, irritated. They said nothing.    A flock of chickadees came down with sunny greetings, fearless,  trustful, never obtrusive. They looked innocently into human faces and  pretended that they did not see the irritation there. \"_Tsic a dee_. I  wish I could help. Perhaps I can. _Tic a dee-e-e?_\"--with that gentle,  sweetly insinuating up slide at the end. Somebody spoke, for the first  time in half an hour, and it wasn't a growl. Presently somebody  whistled--a wee little whistle; but the tide had turned. Then somebody  laughed. \"'Pon my word,\" he said, hanging up his wet clothes, \"I  believe those chickadees make me feel good-natured. Seem kind of  cheery, you know, and the crowd needed it.\"    And Chickadee, picking up his cracker crumbs, did not act at all as if  he had done most to make camp comfortable.    There is another way in which he helps, a more material way. Millions  of destructive insects live and multiply in the buds and tender bark  of trees. Other birds never see them, but Chickadee and his relations  leave never a twig unexplored. His bright eyes find the tiny eggs  hidden under the buds; his keen ears hear the larvae feeding under the  bark, and a blow of his little bill uncovers them in their  mischief-making. His services of this kind are enormous, though rarely  acknowledged.    Chickadee's nest is always neat and comfortable and interesting, just  like himself. It is a rare treat to find it. He selects an old  knot-hole, generally on the sheltered side of a dry limb, and digs out  the rotten wood, making a deep and sometimes winding tunnel downward.  In the dry wood at the bottom he makes a little round pocket and lines  it with the very softest material. When one finds such a nest, with  five or six white eggs delicately touched with pink lying at the  bottom, and a pair of chickadees gliding about, half fearful, half  trustful, it is altogether such a beautiful little spot that I know  hardly a boy who would be mean enough to disturb it.    One thing about the nests has always puzzled me. The soft lining has  generally more or less rabbit fur. Sometimes, indeed, there is nothing  else, and a softer nest one could not wish to see. But where does he  get it? He would not, I am sure, pull it out of Br'er Rabbit, as the  crow sometimes pulls wool from the sheep's backs. Are his eyes bright  enough to find it hair by hair where the wind has blown it, down among  the leaves? If so, it must be slow work; but Chickadee is very  patient. Sometimes in spring you may surprise him on the ground, where  he never goes for food; but at such times he is always shy, and flits  up among the birch twigs, and twitters, and goes through an  astonishing gymnastic performance, as if to distract your attention  from his former unusual one. That is only because you are near his  nest. If he has a bit of rabbit fur in his bill meanwhile, your eyes  are not sharp enough to see it.    Once after such a performance I pretended to go away; but I only hid  in a pine thicket. Chickadee listened awhile, then hopped down to the  ground, picked up something that I could not see, and flew away. I  have no doubt it was the lining for his nest near by. He had dropped  it when I surprised him, so that I should not suspect him of  nest-building.    Such a bright, helpful little fellow should have never an enemy in the  world; and I think he has to contend against fewer than most birds.  The shrike is his worst enemy, the swift swoop of his cruel beak being  always fatal in a flock of chickadees. Fortunately the shrike is rare  with us; one seldom finds his nest, with poor Chickadee impaled on a  sharp thorn near by, surrounded by a varied lot of ugly beetles. I  suspect the owls sometimes hunt him at night; but he sleeps in the  thick pine shrubs, close up against a branch, with the pine needles  all about him, making it very dark; and what with the darkness, and  the needles to stick in his eyes, the owl generally gives up the  search and hunts in more open woods.    Sometimes the hawks try to catch him, but it takes a very quick and a  very small pair of wings to follow Chickadee. Once I was watching him  hanging head down from an oak twig to which the dead leaves were  clinging; for it was winter. Suddenly there was a rush of air, a flash  of mottled wings and fierce yellow eyes and cruel claws. Chickadee  whisked out of sight under a leaf. The hawk passed on, brushing his  pinions. A brown feather floated down among the oak leaves. Then  Chickadee was hanging head down, just where he was before. \"_Tsic a  dee?_ Didn't I fool him!\" he seemed to say. He had just gone round his  twig, and under a leaf, and back again; and the danger was over. When  a hawk misses like that he never strikes again.    Boys generally have a kind of sympathetic liking for Chickadee. They  may be cruel or thoughtless to other birds, but seldom so to him. He  seems somehow like themselves.    Two barefoot boys with bows and arrows were hunting, one September  day, about the half-grown thickets of an old pasture. The older was  teaching the younger how to shoot. A robin, a chipmunk, and two or  three sparrows were already stowed away in their jacket pockets; a  brown rabbit hung from the older boy's shoulder. Suddenly the younger  raised his bow and drew the arrow back to its head. Just in front a  chickadee hung and twittered among the birch twigs. But the older boy  seized his arm.    \"Don't shoot--don't shoot him!\" he said.    \"But why not?\"    \"'Cause you mustn't--you must never kill a chickadee.\"    And the younger, influenced more by a certain mysterious shake of the  head than by the words, slacked his bow cheerfully; and with a last  wide-eyed look at the little gray bird that twittered and swung so  fearlessly near them, the two boys went on with their hunting.    No one ever taught the older boy to discriminate between a chickadee  and other birds; no one else ever instructed the younger. Yet somehow  both felt, and still feel after many years, that there is a  difference. It is always so with boys. They are friends of whatever  trusts them and is fearless. Chickadee's own personality, his cheery  ways and trustful nature had taught them, though they knew it not. And  among all the boys of that neighborhood there is still a law, which no  man gave, of which no man knows the origin, a law as unalterable as  that of the Medes and Persians: _Never kill a chickadee_.    If you ask the boy there who tells you the law, \"Why not a chickadee  as well as a sparrow?\" he shakes his head as of yore, and answers  dogmatically: \"'Cause you mustn't.\"           *       *       *       *       *    CHICKADEE'S SECRET.    If you meet Chickadee in May with a bit of rabbit fur in his mouth, or  if he seem preoccupied or absorbed, you may know that he is building a  nest, or has a wife and children near by to take care of. If you know  him well, you may even feel hurt that the little friend, who shared  your camp and fed from your dish last winter, should this spring seem  just as frank, yet never invite you to his camp, or should even lead  you away from it. But the soft little nest in the old knot-hole is the  one secret of Chickadee's life; and the little deceptions by which he  tries to keep it are at times so childlike, so transparent, that they  are even more interesting than his frankness.    One afternoon in May I was hunting, without a gun, about an old  deserted farm among the hills--one of those sunny places that the  birds love, because some sense of the human beings who once lived  there still clings about the half wild fields and gives protection.  The day was bright and warm. The birds were everywhere, flashing out  of the pine thickets into the birches in all the joyfulness of  nest-building, and filling the air with life and melody. It is poor  hunting to move about at such a time. Either the hunter or his game  must be still. Here the birds were moving constantly; one might see  more of them and their ways by just keeping quiet and invisible.    I sat down on the outer edge of a pine thicket, and became as much as  possible a part of the old stump which was my seat. Just in front an  old four-rail fence wandered across the deserted pasture, struggling  against the blackberry vines, which grew profusely about it and seemed  to be tugging at the lower rail to pull the old fence down to ruin. On  either side it disappeared into thickets of birch and oak and pitch  pine, planted, as were the blackberry vines, by birds that stopped to  rest a moment on the old fence or to satisfy their curiosity. Stout  young trees had crowded it aside and broken it. Here and there a  leaning post was overgrown with woodbine. The rails were gray and  moss-grown. Nature was trying hard to make it a bit of the landscape;  it could not much longer retain its individuality. The wild things of  the woods had long accepted it as theirs, though not quite as they  accepted the vines and trees.    As I sat there a robin hurled himself upon it from the top of a young  cedar where he had been, a moment before, practising his mating song.  He did not intend to light, but some idle curiosity, like my own, made  him pause a moment on the old gray rail. Then a woodpecker lit on the  side of a post, and sounded it softly. But he was too near the ground,  too near his enemies to make a noise; so he flew to a higher perch and  beat a tattoo that made the woods ring. He was safe there, and could  make as much noise as he pleased. A wood-mouse stirred the vines and  appeared for an instant on the lower rail, then disappeared as if very  much frightened at having shown himself in the sunlight. He always  does just so at his first"]]]
