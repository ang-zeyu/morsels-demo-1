For  a 14 inch frame add 1 inch, and for a 16 inch add 2 inches. This will  make these 10 inches and 11 inches in depth respectively when made up,  and either of these will be found a very useful bag for many purposes.  The width of the bottoms to be cut 5 inches, 51/2 inches, and 6 inches,  the 5 inch, of course, for the 12 inch bag, the 51/2 inch for the 14  inch, and the 6 inch for the 16 inch. The depth having been decided  upon, and marked on the folded edge of the paper, make another mark  the same distance from the edge at the first mark, H. The bottom of  the sides being 1 inch longer than the top, add 1/2 inch to the  measurement of the top of pattern when the bottom part is marked off  at J L. Draw a curved line between H L, as in Fig. 9, and cut through  the two thicknesses of paper at one time, keeping them well together  to insure them being alike. The gusset pattern may be cut in the same  way, D to D, Fig. 10, being half the distance of A B, Fig. 7, and the  1/2 inch added for going round the joint; E E, the swelled part, which  bends into the bag when the frame is closed, and also allows it to  open perfectly square; F F is half the width of the bottom of gusset.  A pattern for the bottom of the bag may be made by folding a piece of  paper each way to get the length and width; make a small hole through  the four thicknesses, open it and mark it from hole to hole, using the  rule as a guide. This will be found to be perfectly accurate.    To cut out the bag, lay the leather on the bench, enameled side  downward, and see that the patterns lie on it so the creases will run  from the top to bottom of the bag when made. The sides must be taken  first, and as they are more exposed than any other part, they should  be taken from the best part of the hide. Take the gussets next, then  the bottom. The welts are taken from the cuttings which are left. To  make the handle, glue a lot of odd pieces together about 61/2 inches  long, 1/2 inch wide, and the same thickness, and when dry pare the edges  away until it is perfectly round and slightly tapering toward each  end. It is then divided and glued top and bottom to a strip of good  leather cut to shape, Fig. 12, which is passed through the rings at  each end, and turned back to form a shape. Put a few stitches through  close to the rings before the fittings are glued on, and cover with a  piece of cow-hide long enough to go through the two rings and along  the under side, then stitch it. Trim and dye the edges, rubbing them  afterward with a piece of cloth to produce a polish. Before making the  handle, the plates must be on the rings, or it will prove a difficult  job to get them on afterward.    The stiffening for the bottom will be cut as if for a carpet bag. Fig.  11 represents the stiffening for the gussets, and is cut from a board  half the thickness of that used for the bottom.    The linings may be cut from the outside patterns by reducing them the  11/2 inches, allowed for covering the frame, and 1/8 inch for each welt.  A lining of scarlet or blue roan greatly adds to the appearance and  durability of a bag. A skin large enough for a 14 inch or 16 inch will  cost about 3s.    Cow-hide for the outside is sold at 1s. 8d. per square foot, but the  leather sellers frequently have pieces large enough for making a bag  which they will sell at a slight reduction, and which answers this  purpose as well as cutting a hide. In seaming the bag, take care not  to wrinkle it in the clams. The welts in this must reach only to the  frame, the same as in the carpet bag; the rest of the seam must be  neatly closed and rubbed down, so that it will not be lumpy on the  frame. Before turning the bag warm it before the fire, especially if  it is cold weather. Glue in the bottom stiffening first, and then the  gussets, rubbing them well down with the bone. When these are set,  prepare for the operation of framing. Fold one of the sides to get the  middle of it, cut a hole for the lock barrel about 11/4 inches from the  edge, and press it over. Be careful not to cut it too large or the  hole will show. Pierce a hole through the leather for the lock plate,  press this tightly on the frame, and clinch the clams underneath, to  hold it securely. Make holes for the handle plates and fasten them on  in a similar manner. Two slits must be cut near the middle of the  other side of bag, about 3/4 inch from the edge, for the hasp to go  through. This bag must be sewn to the frame all round, and care must  be taken that a sufficient fullness is allowed in the middle of the  gusset to enable it to close easily round the joints of the frame. A  thumbpiece must be sewn on the bag at the hasp to open it by. The  lining of this bag is sewn through the frame all round in the same  manner as the side linings of the carpet bag.    I hope my readers will not think that I have gone too much into  details. It is in small things that so many failures take place. As it  is much easier to do anything when you are shown than when so much has  to be guessed, it is my desire to make the road for beginners as  smooth as possible, which must be my excuse if any is required. It is  as well that those who intend to turn their attention to working in  leather should begin by making a bag; the experience gained in  cutting, fitting, putting together, and finishing will be useful when  larger and more difficult pieces of work are undertaken.--_Amateur  Mechanics._           *       *       *       *       *          MOLASSES, HOW MADE.      The _New England Grocer_ says that the manufacture of molasses is  really the manufacture of sugar up to a certain stage, for molasses is  the uncrystallized sirup produced in the making of sugar. The methods  of manufacture in the West Indies vary very considerably. In the  interior and on the smaller plantations it is made by a very primitive  process, while on the larger plantations all the appliances of modern  science and ingenuity are brought to bear. Each planter makes his own  sugar. It is then carried to the sea coast and sold to the exporters,  by whom it is shipped to this country. The quality and grade of the  molasses varies with each plantation. Two plantations side by side may  produce entirely different grades. This is owing to the soil, which in  Porto Rico and other localities in the West Indies seems to change  with almost every acre. The cane from which the sugar and molasses is  made is planted by laying several pieces of it in holes or trenches.  The pieces are then covered with earth to the depth of two or three  inches. In about two weeks sprouts appear above the surface. Then more  earth is put in, and as the sprouts grow, earth is added until in  three or four months the holes are filled up. The planting is done  from August to November, and the cutting progresses throughout the  greater part of the year. The cane grows to a height of seven or eight  feet, in joints each about a foot long.    When the cane is in proper condition for cutting, as shown by its  appearance, an army of workmen take possession of the field. Each is  armed with a long, broad knife, like a butcher's cleaver. They move  down the lines of cane like an army, and while the cutting is going on  the fields present an interesting sight, the sword-like knives  flashing in the sun, the 300 or 400 laborers, the carpet of cut cane,  the long line of moving carts, and the sea of standing cane, sometimes  extending for miles and miles, stirred by the breeze into waves of  undulating green. The laborers employed on these plantations are  largely negroes and Chinese coolies. When the cane is ripe, they  proceed to the field, each armed with a _matchet_. Spreading over the  plantation, they commence the cutting of the cane, first by one cut at  the top, which takes off the long leaves and that part which is  worthless, except as fodder for the cattle. A second cut is then given  as near the root as possible, as the nearer the ground the richer the  cane is in juice. The cut cane is allowed to fall carelessly to the  ground.    Other workmen come with carts, pick it up, tie it in bundles and  carry it to the mill. The cutting of the cane is so adjusted as to  keep pace with the action of the mill, so that both are always at  work. Two gangs of men are frequently employed, and work goes on far  into the night during the season, which lasts the greater part of the  year.    As before stated, some of the methods of manufacture are very simple.  In the simplest form, the sugar cane is crushed in a mortar. The juice  thus extracted is boiled in common open pans. After boiling a certain  length of time, it becomes a dark colored, soft, viscid mass. The  uncrystallized sirup is expressed by putting the whole into cloth bags  and subjecting them to pressure. This is molasses in a crude state. It  is further purified by reboiling it with an addition of an alkaline  solution and a quantity of milk. When this has continued until scum no  longer arises, it is evaporated and then transferred to earthen jars.  After it has been left for a few days to granulate, holes in the  bottom of the jars are unstopped, and the molasses drains off into  vessels placed to receive it. Another process of extracting molasses  is as follows: By various processes of boiling and straining, the  juice is brought to a state where it is a soft mass of crystals,  embedded in a thick, but uncrystallized, fluid. The separation of this  fluid is the next process, and is perfected in the curing house, so  called. This is a large building, with a cellar which forms the  molasses reservoir. Over this reservoir is an open framework of  joists, upon which stands a number of empty potting casks. Each of  these has eight or ten holes bored through the bottom, and in each  hole is placed the stalk of a plantain leaf. The soft, concrete mass  of sugar is removed from the cooling pans in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#19)"],[1," lull in the fighting all  along our line. To the north a German force which had crossed the Yser  and intrenched on the left bank was annihilated by a night attack with  the bayonet, executed by the French. Slightly to the south the enemy was  forced back for three-quarters of a mile. Immediately on our left the  French were strongly attacked and driven back a short distance, our  extreme left having to conform to this movement. Our allies soon  recovered the ground they had lost, however, and this enabled us to  advance also.    To the southeast of Ypres the enemy's snipers were very active. On our  centre and right the enemy's bombardment was maintained, but nothing  worthy of special note occurred.    The fact that on this day the advance against our line in front of Ypres  was not pushed home after such an effort as that of Wednesday tends to  show that for the moment the attacking troops had had enough.    Although the failure of this great attack by the Guard Corps to  accomplish their object cannot be described as a decisive event, it  possibly marks the culmination if not the close of the second stage in  the attempt to capture Ypres, arid it is not without significance. It  has also a dramatic interest of its own. Having once definitely failed  to achieve this object by means of the sheer weight of numbers, and  having done their best to wear us down, the Germans brought in fresh  picked troops to carry the Ypres salient by an assault from the north,  the south and the east. That the Guard Corps should have been selected  to act against the eastern edge of the salient may be taken as proof of  the necessity felt by the Germans to gain this point in the line.    Their dogged perseverance in pursuance of their objective claims  whole-hearted admiration. The failure of one great attack, heralded as  it was by an impassioned appeal to the troops made in the presence of  the Emperor himself, but carried out by partially trained men, has been  only the signal for another desperate effort in which the place of honor  was assigned to the corps d'elite of the German Army.    It must be admitted that the Guard Corps has retained that reputation  for courage and contempt of death which it earned in 1870, when Emperor  William I., after the battle of Gravelotte, wrote: \"My Guard has found  its grave in front of St. Privat,\" and the swarms of men who came up  bravely to the British rifles in the woods around Ypres repeated the  tactics of forty-four years ago when their dense columns, toiling up the  slopes of St. Privat, melted away under the fire of the French.    That the Germans are cunning fighters, and well up in all the tricks of  the trade, has frequently been pointed out. For instance, they often  succeed in ascertaining what regiment or brigade is opposed to them, and  because of their knowledge of English, they are able to employ the  information to some purpose. On a recent occasion, having by some means  discovered the name of the commander of the company holding the trench  they were attacking, they called him by name, asking if Captain ---- was  there. Fortunately the pronunciation of the spokesman was somewhat  defective, and their curiosity was rewarded by discovering that both the  officer in question and his men were very much there.    There have been reports from so many different quarters of the enemy  having been seen wearing British and French uniforms that it is  impossible to doubt their truth. One absolutely authentic case occurred  during the fighting near Ypres. A man dressed in a uniform closely  resembling that of a British staff officer suddenly appeared near our  trenches and walked along the line. He asked if many casualties had been  suffered, stated that the situation was serious, and that a general  retirement had been ordered. A similar visit having been reported by  several men in different trenches, orders were issued that this strange  officer was to be detained if seen again. Unluckily he did not make  another appearance.    The following remarks taken from the diary of a German soldier are  published not because there is reason to believe they are justified with  regard to the conduct of German officers but because of their interest  as a human document. Under date of Nov. 2 this German soldier wrote:         Previous to noon we were sent out in a regular storm of bullets on       the order of the Major. These gentlemen, the officers, send their       men forward in a most ridiculous way. They themselves remain far       behind, safely under cover. Our leadership is really scandalous.       Enormous losses on our side are partly from the fire of our own       people, for our leaders neither know where the enemy lies nor where       our own troops are, so that we often are fired on by our own men.       It is a marvel to me that we have got on as far as we have done.         Our Captain fell, as did also all our section leaders and a large       number of our men. Moreover, no purpose was served by this advance,       for we remained the rest of the day under cover; we could go       neither forward nor back, nor even shoot.         The trench we had taken was not occupied by us. The English       naturally took it back at night. That was the sole result. Then       when the enemy had intrenched themselves another attack was made,       costing us many lives and fifty prisoners. It is simply ridiculous,       this leadership. If only I had known it before! My opinion of       German officers has changed.         An Adjutant shouted to us from a trench far to the rear to cut down       a hedge in front of us. Bullets were whistling round from in front       and from behind. The gentleman himself, of course, remained behind.         The Fourth Company has now no leaders but a couple of non-coms.       When will my turn come! I hope to goodness I shall get home again.         In the trenches shells and shrapnel burst without ceasing. In the       evening we get a cup of rice and one-third of an apple per man. Let       us hope peace will soon come. Such a war is really too awful. The       English shoot like mad. If no reinforcements come up, especially       heavy artillery, we shall have a poor lookout and must retire.         The first day I went quietly into the fight with an indifference       which astonished me. Today, for the first time, in advancing, when       my comrades on the right and left were falling, I felt rather       nervous. But I lost that feeling again soon. One becomes horribly       indifferent.         I picked up a piece of bread by chance. Thank God! At least I have       something to eat.         There are about 70,000 English who must be attacked from all four       sides and destroyed. However, they defend themselves obstinately.          XII.    *Attacked by 750,000 Germans.*    [Official Summary, Dated Dec. 3.]      Col. E.D. Swinton of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff of  the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium, in a narrative  dated Nov. 26, gives a general review of the development of the  situation of the force for six weeks preceding that date.    There has recently been a lull in the active operations, he says. No  progress has been made by either side, and yet there has come about an  important modification comprising a readjustment in the scope of the  part played by the British Army as a whole. He explains the movement  from the River Aisne to the Belgian frontier to prolong the left flank  of the French Army, and says that in attempting this the British force  was compelled to assume responsibility for a very extended section of  the front. He points out, as did Field Marshal Sir John French,  Commander in Chief of the British forces, that the British held only  one-twelfth of the line, so that the greater share of the common task of  opposing the enemy fell and still falls to the French, while the  Belgians played an almost vital part.    With the fall of Antwerp the Germans made every effort to push forward a  besieging force toward the west and hastened to bring up a new army  corps which had been hastily raised and trained, their object being to  drive the Allies out of Belgium and break through to Dunkirk and Calais.  Altogether they had a quarter of a million of fresh men. Eventually the  Germans had north of La Bassee about fourteen corps and eight cavalry  divisions, that is, \"a force of three-quarters of a million of men with  which to attempt to drive the Allies into the sea. In addition, there  was immensely powerful armament and heavy siege artillery, which also  had been brought up from around Antwerp.\"    The official eye-witness tells of the blows delivered by the Germans at  Nieuport, Dixmude, and Ypres, where \"at first the Allies were greatly  outnumbered.\" For a whole month the British army around Ypres succeeded  in holding its ground against repeated onslaughts made by vastly  superior forces. The writer goes into details of the German attacks and  describes how they were frustrated by the Allies.    The British force, says Col. Swinton, which consisted all along of the  same units, had \"to withstand an almost continuous bombardment and to  meet one desperate assault after another, each carried out by fresh  units from the large numbers which the Germans were devoting to the  operation.\" Finally the French came to their assistance, and \"never was  help more welcome; for by then our small local reserves had again and  again been thrown into the fight in the execution of counter-attacks,  and our men were exhausted by the incessant fighting.\"    The British front now has been considerably shortened and in addition  has been reinforced, while a lull in the activity has enabled the  British to readjust their forces, strengthen their positions, and bring  up reserves. There has, therefore, \"been a great general improvement in  the conditions under which we are carrying on the fight\". Of "]]]
