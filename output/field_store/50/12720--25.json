[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#19)"],[1,"I was  awakened, just before the attack, by the creature's _coughing_--by its  vile, high pitched _coughing_....\"    I glanced around at the books upon my shelves. Often enough, following  some outrage by the brilliant, Chinese doctor whose genius was  directed to the discovery of new and unique death agents, we had  obtained a clue in those works of a scientific nature which bulk  largely in the library of a medical man. There are creatures, there  are drugs, which, ordinarily innocuous, may be so employed as to  become inimical to human life; and in the distorting of nature, in the  disturbing of balances and the diverting of beneficent forces into  strange and dangerous channels, Dr. Fu-Manchu excelled. I had known  him to enlarge, by artificial culture, a minute species of fungus so  as to render it a powerful agent capable of attacking man; his  knowledge of venomous insects has probably never been paralleled in  the history of the world; whilst, in the sphere of pure toxicology, he  had, and has, no rival: the Borgias were children by comparison. But,  look where I would, think how I might, no adequate explanation of this  latest outrage seemed possible along normal lines.    \"There's the clue,\" said Nayland Smith, pointing to a little ash-tray  upon the table near by. \"Follow it if you can.\"    But I could not.    \"As I have explained,\" continued my friend, \"I was awakened by a sound  of coughing; then came a death grip on my throat, and instinctively my  hands shot out in search of my attacker. I could not reach him; my  hands came in contact with nothing palpable. Therefore I clutched at  the fingers which were dug into my windpipe, and found them to be  small--as the marks show--and _hairy_. I managed to give that first  cry for help, and with all my strength I tried to unfasten the grip  that was throttling the life out of me. At last I contrived to move  one of the hands, and I called out again, though not so loudly. Then  both the hands were back again; I was weakening; but I clawed like a  madman at the thin, hairy arms of the strangling thing, and with a  blood-red mist dancing before my eyes, I seemed to be whirling madly  round and round until all became a blank. Evidently I used my nails  pretty freely--and there's the trophy.\"    For the twentieth time, I should think, I raised the ash-tray in my  hand and held it immediately under the table lamp in order to examine  its contents. In the little brass bowl lay a blood-stained fragment of  greyish hair attached to a tatter of skin. This fragment of epidermis  had an odd bluish tinge, and the attached hair was much darker at the  roots than elsewhere. Saving its singular colour, it might have been  torn from the forearm of a very hirsute human; but although my  thoughts wandered, unfettered, north, south, east and west; although,  knowing the resources of Fu-Manchu, I considered all the recognized  Mongolian types, and, in quest of hirsute mankind, even roamed, far  north among the blubber-eating Esquimaux; although I glanced at  Australasia, at Central Africa, and passed in mental review the dark  places of the Congo, nowhere in the known world, nowhere in the  history of the human species, could I come upon a type of man  answering to the description suggested by our strange clue.    Nayland Smith was watching me curiously as I bent over the little  brass ash-tray.    \"You are puzzled,\" he rapped in his short way. \"So am I--utterly  puzzled. Fu-Manchu's gallery of monstrosities clearly has become  reinforced; for even if we identified the type, we should not be in  sight of our explanation.\"    \"You mean--\" I began.    \"Fully four feet from the window, Petrie, and that window but a few  inches open! Look\"--he bent forward, resting his chest against the  table, and stretched out his hand towards me--\"you have a rule there;  just measure.\"    Setting down the ash-tray, I opened out the rule and measured the  distance from the farther edge of the table to the tips of Smith's  fingers.    \"Twenty-eight inches--and _I_ have a long reach!\" snapped Smith,  withdrawing his arm and striking a match to relight his pipe. \"There's  one thing, Petrie, often proposed before, which now we must do without  delay. The ivy must be stripped from the walls at the back. It's a  pity, but we cannot afford to sacrifice our lives to our sense of the  aesthetic. What do you make of the sound like the cracking of a whip?\"    \"I make nothing of it, Smith,\" I replied wearily. \"It might have been  a thick branch of ivy breaking beneath the weight of a climber.\"    \"Did it sound like it?\"    \"I must confess that the explanation does not convince me, but I have  no better one.\"    Smith, permitting his pipe to go out, sat staring straightly before  him, and tugging at the lobe of his left ear.    \"The old bewilderment is seizing me,\" I continued. \"At first, when I  realized that Dr. Fu-Manchu was back in England, when I realized that  an elaborate murder-machine was set up somewhere in London, it seemed  unreal, fantastical. Then I met--Karamaneh! She, whom we thought to be  his victim, showed herself again to be his slave. Now, with Weymouth  and Scotland Yard at work, the old secret evil is established again in  our midst, unaccountably--our lives are menaced--sleep is a  danger--every shadow threatens death ... oh! it is awful.\"    Smith remained silent; he did not seem to have heard my words. I knew  these moods and had learnt that it was useless to seek to interrupt  them. With his brows drawn down, and his deep-set eyes staring into  space, he sat there gripping his cold pipe so tightly that my own jaw  muscles ached sympathetically. No man was better equipped than this  gaunt British Commissioner to stand between society and the menace of  the Yellow Doctor; I respected his meditations, for, unlike my own,  they were informed by an intimate knowledge of the dark and secret  things of the East, of that mysterious East out of which Fu-Manchu  came, of that jungle of noxious things whose miasma had been wafted  Westward with the implacable Chinaman.    I walked quietly from the room, occupied with my own bitter  reflections.          CHAPTER XV    BEWITCHMENT      \"You say you have two pieces of news for me?\" said Nayland Smith,  looking across the breakfast table to where Inspector Weymouth sat  sipping coffee.    \"There are two points--yes,\" replied the Scotland Yard man, whilst  Smith paused, egg-spoon in hand, and fixed his keen eyes upon the  speaker. \"The first is this: the headquarters of the yellow group is  no longer in the East End.\"    \"How can you be sure of that?\"    \"For two reasons. In the first place, that district must now be too  hot to hold Dr. Fu-Manchu; in the second place, we have just completed  a house-to-house inquiry which has scarcely overlooked a rathole or a  rat. That place where you say Fu-Manchu was visited by some Chinese  mandarin; where you, Mr. Smith, and\"--glancing in my direction--\"you,  doctor, were confined for a time--\"    \"Yes?\" snapped Smith, attacking his egg.    \"Well,\" continued the Inspector, \"it is all deserted now. There is not  the slightest doubt that the Chinaman has fled to some other abode. I  am certain of it. My second piece of news will interest you very much,  I am sure. You were taken to the establishment of the Chinaman,  Shen-Yan, by a certain ex-officer of New York Police--Burke....\"    \"Good God!\" cried Smith, looking up with a start; \"I thought they had  him!\"    \"So did I,\" replied Weymouth grimly; \"but they haven't! He got away in  the confusion following the raid, and has been hiding ever since with  a cousin--a nurseryman out Upminster way....\"    \"Hiding?\" snapped Smith.    \"Exactly--hiding. He has been afraid to stir ever since, and has  scarcely shown his nose outside the door. He says he is watched night  and day.\"    \"Then how ...!\"    \"He realized that something must be done,\" continued the Inspector,  \"and made a break this morning. He is so convinced of this constant  surveillance that he came away secretly, hidden under the boxes of a  market-wagon. He landed at Covent Garden in the early hours of this  morning and came straight away to the Yard.\"    \"What is he afraid of exactly?\"    Inspector Weymouth put down his coffee cup and bent forward slightly.    \"He knows something,\" he said in a low voice, \"and _they_ are aware  that he knows it!\"    \"And what is this he knows?\"    Nayland Smith stared eagerly at the detective.    \"Every man has his price,\" replied Weymouth, with a smile, \"and Burke  seems to think that you are a more likely market than the police  authorities.\"    \"I see,\" snapped Smith. \"He wants to see _me_?\"    \"He wants you to go and see _him_,\" was the reply. \"I think he  anticipates that you may make a capture of the person or persons  spying upon him.\"    \"Did he give you any particulars?\"    \"Several. He spoke of a sort of gipsy girl with whom he had a short  conversation one day, over the fence which divides his cousin's flower  plantations from the lane adjoining.\"    \"Gipsy girl!\" I whispered, glancing rapidly at Smith.    \"I think you are right, doctor,\" said Weymouth with his slow smile;  \"it was Karamaneh. She asked him the way to somewhere or other and got  him to write it upon a loose page of his notebook, so that she should  not forget it.\"    \"You hear that, Petrie?\" rapped Smith.    \"I hear it,\" I replied, \"but I don't see any special significance in  the fact.\"    \"I do!\" rapped Smith. \"I didn't sit up the greater part of last night  thrashing my weary brains for nothing! But I am going to the British  Museum to-day, to confirm a certain suspicion.\" He turned to Weymouth.  \"Did Burke go back?\" he demanded abruptly.    \"He returned hidden under the empty boxes,\" was the reply. \"Oh! you  never saw a man in such a funk in all your life!\"    \"He may have good reasons,\" I said.    \"He _has_ good reasons!\" replied Nayland Smith grimly; \"if that man  really"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#19)"],[1," a Beaker trader, persisted  in using a language Ross did not know.    \"We do not play as children here.\" At last the man spoke words Ross  could understand. \"You will answer me or else others shall ask the  questions, and less gently. I say to you now--who are you and from where  do you come?\"    For a moment Ross glowered across the table at him, his inbred  antagonism to authority aroused by that contemptuous demand, but then  common sense cautioned. His initial introduction to this village had  left him bruised and with one of his headaches. There was no reason to  let them beat him until he was in no shape to make a break for freedom  when and if there was an opportunity.    \"I am Rossa of the traders,\" he returned, eying the man with a carefully  measured stare. \"I came into this land in search of my kinsmen who were  taken by raiders in the night.\"    The man, who sat on a stool by the table, smiled slowly. Again he spoke  in the strange tongue, and Ross merely stared stolidly back. His words  were short and explosive sounding, and the man's smile faded; his  annoyance grew as he continued to speak.    One of Ross's two guards ventured to interrupt, using the Beaker  language. \"From where did you come?\" He was a quiet-faced, slender man,  not like his companion, who had roped Murdock from behind and was of the  bully breed, able to subdue Ross's wildcat resistance in a very short  struggle.    \"I came to this land from the south,\" Ross answered, \"after the manner  of my people. This is a new land with furs and the golden tears of the  sun to be gathered and bartered. The traders move in peace, and their  hands are raised against no man. Yet in the darkness there came those  who would slay without profit, for what reason I have no knowing.\"    The quiet man continued the questioning and Ross answered fully with  details of the past of one Rossa, a Beaker merchant. Yes, he was from  the south. His father was Gurdi, who had a trading post in the warm  lands along the big river. This was Rossa's first trip to open new  territory. He had come with his father's blood brother, Assha, who was a  noted far voyager, and it was an honor to be chosen as donkey-leader for  such a one as Assha. With Assha had been Macna, one who was also a far  trader, though not as noted as Assha.    Of a certainty, Assha was of his own race! Ross blinked at that  question. One need only to look upon him to know that he was of trader  blood and no uncivilized woodsrunner. How long had he known Assha? Ross  shrugged. Assha had come to his father's post the winter before and had  stayed with them through the cold season. Gurdi and Assha had mingled  blood after he pulled Gurdi free from the river in flood. Assha had  lost his boat and trade goods in that rescue, so Gurdi had made good his  loss this year. Detail by detail he gave the story. In spite of the fact  that he provided these details glibly, sure that they were true, Ross  continued to be haunted by an odd feeling that he was indeed reciting a  tale of adventure which had happened long ago and to someone else.  Perhaps that pain in his head made him think of these events as very  colorless and far away.    \"It would seem\"--the quiet man turned to the one behind the table--\"that  this is indeed one Rossa, a Beaker trader.\"    But the man looked impatient, angry. He made a sign to the other guard,  who turned Ross around roughly and sent him toward the door with a  shove. Once again the leader gave an order in his own language, adding a  few words more with a stinging snap that might have been a threat or a  warning.    Ross was thrust into a small room with a hard floor and not even a skin  rug to serve as a bed. Since the quiet man had ordered the removal of  the ropes from Ross's arms, he leaned against the wall, rubbing the pain  of returning circulation away from his wrists and trying to understand  what had happened to him and where he was. Having spied upon it from the  heights, he knew it wasn't an ordinary trading station, and he wanted to  know what they did here. Also, somewhere in this village he hoped to  find Assha and Macna.    At the end of the day his captors opened the door only long enough to  push inside a bowl and a small jug. He felt for those in the dusk,  dipping his fingers into a lukewarm mush of meal and drinking the water  from the jug avidly. His headache dulled, and from experience Ross knew  that this bout was almost over. If he slept, he would waken with a  clearer mind and no pain. Knowing he was very tired, he took the  precaution of curling up directly in front of the door so that no one  could enter without arousing him.    It was still dark when he awoke with a curious urgency remaining from a  dream he could not remember. Ross sat up, flexing his arms and shoulders  to combat the stiffness which had come with his cramped sleep. He could  not rid himself of a feeling that there was something to be done and  that time was his enemy.    Assha! Gratefully he seized on that. He must find Assha and Macna, for  the three of them could surely discover a way to get out of this  village. That was what was so important!    He had been handled none too gently, and they were holding him a  prisoner. But Ross believed that this was not the worst which could  happen to him here, and he must be free before the worst did come. The  question was, How could he escape? His bow and dagger were gone, and he  did not even have his long cloak pin for a weapon, since he had given  that to Frigga.    Running his hands over his body, Ross inventoried what remained of his  clothing and possessions. He unfastened the bronze chain-belt still  buckled in his kilt tunic, swinging the length speculatively in one  hand. A masterpiece of craftsmanship, it consisted of patterned plates  linked together with a series of five finely wrought chains and a front  buckle in the form of a lion's head, its protruding tongue serving as a  hook to support a dagger sheath. Its weight promised a weapon of sorts,  which when added to the element of surprise might free him.    By rights they would be expecting him to produce some opposition,  however. It was well known that only the best fighters, the shrewdest  minds, followed the traders' roads. It was a proud thing to be a trader  in the wilderness, a thought that warmed Ross now as he waited in the  dark for what luck and Ba-Bal of the Bright Horns would send. Were he  ever to return to Gurdi's post, Ba-Bal, whose boat rode across the sky  from dawn to dusk, would have a fine ox, jars of the first brewing, and  sweet-smelling amber laid upon his altar.    Ross had patience which he had learned from the mixed heritage of his  two pasts, the real and the false graft. He could wait as he had waited  many times before--quiet, and with outward ease--for the right moment to  come. It came now with footsteps ringing sharply, halting before his  cell door.    With the noiseless speed of a hunting cat, Ross flung himself from  behind the door to a wall, where he would be hidden from the newcomer  for that necessary instant or two. If his attack was to be successful,  it must occur inside the room. He heard the sound of a bar being slid  out of its brackets, and he poised himself, the belt rippling from his  right hand.    The door was opening inward, and a man stood silhouetted against the  outer light. He muttered, looking toward the corner where Ross had  thrown his single garment in a roll which might just resemble, for the  needed second or two, a man curled in slumber. The man in the doorway  took the bait, coming forward far enough for Ross to send the door  slamming shut as he himself sprang with the belt aimed for the other's  head.    There was a startled cry, cut off in the middle as the belt plates met  flesh and bone in a crushing force. Luck was with him! Ross caught up  his kilt and belted it around him after he had made a hurried  examination of the body now lying at his feet. He was not sure that the  man was dead, but at any rate he was completely unconscious. Ross  stripped off the man's cloak, located his dagger, freed it from the belt  hook, and snapped it on his own.    Then inch by inch Ross edged open the door, peering through the crack.  As far as he could see, the hall was empty, so he jerked the portal  open, and dagger in hand, sprang out, ready for attack. He closed the  door, slipping the bar back into its brackets. If the man inside revived  and pounded for attention, his own friends might think it was Ross and  delay investigating.    But the escape from the cell was the easiest part of what he planned to  do, as Ross well knew. To find Assha and Macna in this maze of rooms  occupied by the enemy was far more difficult. Although he had no idea in  which of the village buildings they might be confined, this one was the  largest and seemed to be the headquarters of the chief men, which meant  it could also serve as their prison.    Light came from a torch in a bracket halfway down the hall. The wood  burned smokily, giving off a resinous odor, and to Ross the glow was  sufficient illumination. He slipped along as close to the wall as he  could, ready to freeze at the slightest sound. But this portion of the  building might well have been deserted, for he saw or heard no one. He  tried the only two doors opening out of the hall, but they were secured  on the other side. Then he came to a bend in the corridor, and stopped  short, hearing a murmur of low voices.    If he had used a hunter's tricks of silent tread and vigilant wariness  before, Ross was doubly on guard now as he wriggled to a point from  which he could see beyond that turn. Mere luck prevented him from giving  himself away a moment later.    Assha! Assha, alive, well, apparently under no restraint, was just  turning away from the same quiet man who had had a part in Ross's  interrogation. That was surely Assha's brown hair, his slender wiry body"]]]
