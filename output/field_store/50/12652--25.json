The Savoy Conference proved a failure, and  no lay reader of Baxter's account of it can profess wonder. Not a single  point in difference was settled. In the meantime the restored Houses of  Convocation, from which the Presbyterian members were excluded, had  completed their revision of the Book of Common Prayer and presented it  to Parliament.    In considering the Bill for Uniformity, the House of Lords, where  Presbyterianism was powerfully represented, showed more regard for those  \"tender consciences\" to which the king (by the new Prayer Book called  for the first time \"our most religious King\") had referred in his Breda  Declaration than did the House of Commons. \"The Book, the whole Book,  and nothing but the Book\" was, in effect, the cry of the lower House,  and on the 19th of May, ten days after Marvell had left for the  Continent, the Act of Uniformity became law, and by the 24th of August  1662 all beneficed ministers and schoolmasters had to make the  celebrated subscription and profession, or go out into the wilderness.    There has always been a dispute as to the physical possibility of  perusing the compilation in question before the day fixed by the  Statute. The Book was advertised for sale in London on the 6th of  August, but how many copies were actually available on that day is not  known.    The Dean and Chapter of Peterborough did not get their copies until the  17th of August. When the new folios reached the lonely parsonages of  Cumberland and Durham--who would care to say? The Act required a verbal  avowal of \"unfeigned assent and consent to all and everything contained  and prescribed in and by the Book of Common Prayer, and administrations  of the Sacraments and other rites and ceremonies of the Church according  to the use of the Church of England, together with the Psalter, and the  form of manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating Bishops, Priests,  and Deacons\" to be made after the service upon \"some Lord's day\" before  the Feast of St. Bartholomew, _i.e._ the 24th of August 1662. The Act  also required subscription within the same time-limit to a declaration  of (_inter alia_) uniformity to the Liturgy of the Church of England \"as  it is now by law established.\"    That this haste was indecent no layman is likely to dispute, but that it  wrought practical wrong is doubtful. The Vicar of Bray needed no time to  read his new Folio to enable him to make whatever avowal concerning it  the law demanded; and as for signing the declaration, all he required  for that purpose was pen and ink. Neither had the incumbent, who was a  good churchman at heart, any doubts to settle. He rejoiced to know that  his side was once more uppermost, and that it would be no longer  necessary for him, in order to retain his living, to pretend to tolerate  a Presbyterian, or to submit to read in his church the Directory of  Public Worship. Convocation had approved the new Prayer Book, which was  in substance the old one, and what more did any churchman require? As  for the Presbyterians and others who were in possession of livings, the  failure of the Savoy Conference must have made it plain to them that the  Church of England had not allowed the king to keep his word, that  compromise and comprehension had failed, and that if they were to remain  where they were, it could only be on terms of completely severing  themselves from all other Protestant bodies in the world, and becoming  thorough Episcopalians. No Presbyterian of any eminence was prepared to  make the statutory avowal. Painful as it always must be to give up any  good thing by a fixed date, it is hard to see what advantage would have  accrued from delay.    When the day came, some two thousand parsons were turned out of the  Church of England. Among them were included many of the most devout and  some of the most learned of our divines. Their \"coming in\" had been  irregular, their \"going out\" was painful.    Save so far as it turned these men out, the Act was a failure. It did  not procure that uniformity in the public worship of God which it  declared was so desirable; it prevented no scandal; it arrested no  decay; it allayed no distemper, and it certainly did not settle the  peace of the Church. Inside the Church the bishops were supine, the  parochial clergy indifferent, and the worshippers, if such a name can  properly be bestowed upon the congregations, were grossly irreverent.  Nor was any improvement in the conduct of the Church service noticeable  until after the Revolution, and when legislation had conceded a somewhat  shabby measure of toleration to those who by that time had become rigid,  traditional, and hereditary dissenters. Then indeed some attempts began  to be made to secure a real uniformity of ritual in the public worship  of the Church of England.[104:1] How far success has rewarded these  exertions it is not for me to say.    Marvell did not remain long at home after his return from Holland. A  strange adventure lay before him. He thus introduces it in a letter  dated 20th June 1663:--       \"GENTLEMEN, MY VERY WORTHY FRIENDS,--The relation I have to your     affairs, and the intimacy of that affection I ow you, do both     incline and oblige me to communicate to you, that there is a     probability I may very shortly have occasion to go beyond sea; for     my Lord of Carlisle being chosen by his Majesty, Embassadour     Extraordinary to Muscovy, Sweden, and Denmarke, hath used his power,     which ought to be very great with me, to make me goe along with him     Secretary in those embassages. It is no new thing for Members of our     House to be dispens'd with for the service of the King and Nation in     forain parts. And you may be sure that I will not stirre without     speciall leave of the House; that so you may be freed from any     possibility of being importuned or tempted to make any other choice,     in my absence. However, I can not but advise also with you, desiring     to take your assent along with me, so much esteeme I have both of     your prudence and friendship. The time allotted for the embassy is     not much above a yeare: probably it may not be much less betwixt our     adjournment and next meeting; and, however, you have Colonell Gilby,     to whom my presence can make litle addition, so that if I cannot     decline this voyage, I shall have the comfort to believe, that, all     things considered, you cannot thereby receive any disservice. I     shall hope to receive herein your speedy answer....\"    What was the \"power\" Lord Carlisle had over Marvell is not now  discoverable, but the tie, whatever it may have been, was evidently a  close one.    A month after this letter Marvell started on his way.       \"GENTLEMEN, MY VERY WORTHY FRIENDS,--Being this day taking barge for     Gravesend, there to embark for Archangel, so to Muscow, thence for     Sweden, and last of all Denmarke; all of which I hope, by God's     blessing, to finish within twelve moneths time: I do hereby, with my     last and seriousest thoughts, salute you, rendring you all hearty     thanks for your great kindnesse and friendship to me upon all     occasions, and ardently beseeching God to keep you all in His     gracious protection, to your own honour, and the welfare and     flourishing of your Corporation, to which I am and shall ever     continue a most affectionate and devoted servant. I undertake this     voyage with the order and good liking of his Majesty, and by leave     given me from the House and enterd in the Journal; and having     received moreover your approbation, I go therefore with more ease     and satisfaction of mind, and augurate to myselfe the happier     successe in all my proceedings....\"    It was Marvell's good fortune to be in Lord Carlisle's frigate which  made the voyage to Archangel in less than a month, sailing from  Gravesend on the 22nd of July and arriving at the bar of Archangel on  the 19th of August. The companion frigate took seven weeks to compass  the same distance.    Nothing of any importance attaches to this Russian embassy. It cost a  great deal of money, took up a great deal of time, exposed the  ambassador and his suite to much rudeness and discomfort, and failed to  effect its main object, which was to secure a renewal of the privileges  formerly enjoyed in Muscovy by British merchants.    One of the attendants upon the ambassador made a small book out of his  travels, which did not get printed till 1669, when it attracted little  notice. Mr. Grosart was the first of Marvell's many biographers to  discover the existence of this narrative.[106:1] He found it in the  first instance, to use his own language, \"in one of good trusty John  Harris' folios of _Travels and Voyages_\" (two vols. folio, 1705); but  later on he made the sad discovery that this \"good trusty John Harris\"  had uplifted what he called his \"true and particular account\" from the  book of 1669 without any acknowledgment. \"For ways that are dark\" the  old compiler of travels was not easily excelled, but why should Mr.  Grosart have gone out of his way to call an eighteenth-century  book-maker, about whom he evidently knew nothing, \"good and trusty\"?  Harris was never either the one or the other, and died a pauper!    A journey to Moscow in 1663-64 was no joke. Lord Carlisle, who was  accompanied by his wife and eldest son, although ready to start from  Archangel by the end of September, was doomed to spend both the 5th of  November and Christmas Day in the gloomy town of Vologda, which they had  reached, travelling by water, on the 17th of October. Some of this time  was spent in quarrelling as to who was to supply the sledges that were  required to convey the ambassador and all his _impedimenta_ along the  now ice-bound roads to Moscow. It was one of Marvell's many duties to  remonstrate with the authorities for their cruel and disrespectful  indifference;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#19)"],[1,"I did not want it.\"    She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not  cry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she  hated the wind and its \"wuthering.\" She could not go to sleep again. The  mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If she  had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it  \"wuthered\" and how the big rain-drops poured down and beat against the  pane!    \"It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on  crying,\" she said.           *       *       *       *       *    She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour,  when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward  the door listening. She listened and she listened.    \"It isn't the wind now,\" she said in a loud whisper. \"That isn't the  wind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.\"    The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a  far-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes  and each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must  find out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and  the buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made  her bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.    \"I am going to find out what it is,\" she said. \"Everybody is in bed and  I don't care about Mrs. Medlock--I don't care!\"    There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out  of the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too  excited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she must  turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry--the  one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself. The sound  had come up that passage. So she went on with her dim light, almost  feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could  hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led her. Sometimes it  stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this the right  corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this passage  and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the right  again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.    She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood  in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was  not loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few  yards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of light  coming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it was  quite a young Someone.    So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standing  in the room!    It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a  low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the  side of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was  lying a boy, crying fretfully.    Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep  again and was dreaming without knowing it.    The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to  have eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over  his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He  looked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he were  tired and cross than as if he were in pain.    Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her  breath. Then she crept across the room, and as she drew nearer the  light attracted the boy's attention and he turned his head on his pillow  and stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed  immense.    [Illustration: \"'WHO ARE YOU?--ARE YOU A GHOST?'\"--_Page 157_]    \"Who are you?\" he said at last in a half-frightened whisper. \"Are you a  ghost?\"    \"No, I am not,\" Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half frightened.  \"Are you one?\"    He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what  strange eyes he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for  his face because they had black lashes all round them.    \"No,\" he replied after waiting a moment or so. \"I am Colin.\"    \"Who is Colin?\" she faltered.    \"I am Colin Craven. Who are you?\"    \"I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.\"    \"He is my father,\" said the boy.    \"Your father!\" gasped Mary. \"No one ever told me he had a boy! Why  didn't they?\"    \"Come here,\" he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her with  an anxious expression.    She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.    \"You are real, aren't you?\" he said. \"I have such real dreams very  often. You might be one of them.\"    Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she  put a piece of it between his fingers.    \"Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,\" she said. \"I will pinch you  a little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I thought  you might be a dream too.\"    \"Where did you come from?\" he asked.    \"From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn't go to sleep and I  heard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were you  crying for?\"    \"Because I couldn't go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me your  name again.\"    \"Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?\"    He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look a  little more as if he believed in her reality.    \"No,\" he answered. \"They daren't.\"    \"Why?\" asked Mary.    \"Because I should have been afraid you would see me. I won't let people  see me and talk me over.\"    \"Why?\" Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.    \"Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father  won't let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to  speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan't live. My  father hates to think I may be like him.\"    \"Oh, what a queer house this is!\" Mary said. \"What a queer house!  Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are  locked up--and you! Have you been locked up?\"    \"No. I stay in this room because I don't want to be moved out of it. It  tires me too much.\"    \"Does your father come and see you?\" Mary ventured.    \"Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn't want to see me.\"    \"Why?\" Mary could not help asking again.    A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy's face.    \"My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me.  He thinks I don't know, but I've heard people talking. He almost hates  me.\"    \"He hates the garden, because she died,\" said Mary half speaking to  herself.    \"What garden?\" the boy asked.    \"Oh! just--just a garden she used to like,\" Mary stammered. \"Have you  been here always?\"    \"Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside,  but I won't stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an iron  thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to  see me and said it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep me  out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don't want to go out.\"    \"I didn't when first I came here,\" said Mary. \"Why do you keep looking  at me like that?\"    \"Because of the dreams that are so real,\" he answered rather fretfully.  \"Sometimes when I open my eyes I don't believe I'm awake.\"    \"We're both awake,\" said Mary. She glanced round the room with its high  ceiling and shadowy corners and dim firelight. \"It looks quite like a  dream, and it's the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is  asleep--everybody but us. We are wide awake.\"    \"I don't want it to be a dream,\" the boy said restlessly.    Mary thought of something all at once.    \"If you don't like people to see you,\" she began, \"do you want me to go  away?\"    He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.    \"No,\" he said. \"I should be sure you were a dream if you went. If you  are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear about  you.\"    Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the  cushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stay  in the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.    \"What do you want me to tell you?\" she said.    He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to  know which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had been  doing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had lived  before she came to Yorkshire. She answered all these questions and many  more and he lay back on his pillow and listened. He made her tell him a  great deal about India and about her voyage across the ocean. She found  out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things as  other children had. One of his nurses had taught him to read when he was  quite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures in  splendid books.    Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all  sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to have  been amused, however. He could have anything he asked for and was never  made to do anything he did not like to do.    \"Every one is obliged to do what pleases me,\" he said indifferently. \"It  makes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.\"    He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to  matter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary's voice. As  she went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once or  twice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But at  last he asked a question which opened up a new subject.    \"How old are you?\" he asked.    \"I am ten,\" answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, \"and so  are you.\"    \"How do you know that?\" he demanded in a"]]]
