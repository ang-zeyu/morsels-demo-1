The steward had accepted nothing, but a report got about that a mighty  nugget of gold had been given him by his former master, and Timon  therefore received more visitors. They were a painter and a poet, whom  he had patronized in his prosperity.    \"Hail, worthy Timon!\" said the poet. \"We heard with astonishment how  your friends deserted you. No whip's large enough for their backs!\"    \"We have come,\" put in the painter, \"to offer our services.\"    \"You've heard that I have gold,\" said Timon.    \"There was a report,\" said the painter, blushing; \"but my friend and I  did not come for that.\"    \"Good honest men!\" jeered Timon. \"All the same, you shall have plenty of  gold if you will rid me of two villains.\"    \"Name them,\" said his two visitors in one breath. \"Both of you!\"  answered Timon. Giving the painter a whack with a big stick, he said,  \"Put that into your palette and make money out of it.\" Then he gave a  whack to the poet, and said, \"Make a poem out of that and get paid for  it. There's gold for you.\"    They hurriedly withdrew.    Finally Timon was visited by two senators who, now that Athens was  threatened by Alcibiades, desired to have on their side this bitter  noble whose gold might help the foe.    \"Forget your injuries,\" said the first senator. \"Athens offers you  dignities whereby you may honorably live.\"    \"Athens confesses that your merit was overlooked, and wishes to atone,  and more than atone, for her forgetfulness,\" said the second senator.    \"Worthy senators,\" replied Timon, in his grim way, \"I am almost weeping;  you touch me so! All I need are the eyes of a woman and the heart of a  fool.\"    But the senators were patriots. They believed that this bitter man could  save Athens, and they would not quarrel with him. \"Be our captain,\"  they said, \"and lead Athens against Alcibiades, who threatens to destroy  her.\"    \"Let him destroy the Athenians too, for all I care,\" said Timon; and  seeing an evil despair in his face, they left him.    The senators returned to Athens, and soon afterwards trumpets were blown  before its walls. Upon the walls they stood and listened to Alcibiades,  who told them that wrong-doers should quake in their easy chairs. They  looked at his confident army, and were convinced that Athens must yield  if he assaulted it, therefore they used the voice that strikes deeper  than arrows.    \"These walls of ours were built by the hands of men who never wronged  you, Alcibiades,\" said the first senator.    \"Enter,\" said the second senator, \"and slay every tenth man, if your  revenge needs human flesh.\"    \"Spare the cradle,\" said the first senator.    \"I ask only justice,\" said Alcibiades. \"If you admit my army, I will  inflict the penalty of your own laws upon any soldier who breaks them.\"    At that moment a soldier approached Alcibiades, and said, \"My noble  general, Timon is dead.\" He handed Alcibiades a sheet of wax, saying,  \"He is buried by the sea, on the beach, and over his grave is a stone  with letters on it which I cannot read, and therefore I have impressed  them on wax.\"    Alcibiades read from the sheet of wax this couplet--       \"Here lie I, Timon, who, alive,          all living men did hate.      Pass by and say your worst; but pass,          and stay not here your gait.\"    \"Dead, then, is noble Timon,\" said Alcibiades; and be entered Athens  with an olive branch instead of a sword.    So it was one of Timon's friends who was generous in a greater matter  than Timon's need; yet are the sorrow and rage of Timon remembered as a  warning lest another ingratitude should arise to turn love into hate.          OTHELLO        Four hundred years ago there lived in Venice an ensign named Iago, who  hated his general, Othello, for not making him a lieutenant. Instead of  Iago, who was strongly recommended, Othello had chosen Michael Cassio,  whose smooth tongue had helped him to win the heart of Desdemona. Iago  had a friend called Roderigo, who supplied him with money and felt he  could not be happy unless Desdemona was his wife.    Othello was a Moor, but of so dark a complexion that his enemies called  him a Blackamoor. His life had been hard and exciting. He had been  vanquished in battle and sold into slavery; and he had been a great  traveler and seen men whose shoulders were higher than their heads.  Brave as a lion, he had one great fault--jealousy. His love was a  terrible selfishness. To love a woman meant with him to possess her as  absolutely as he possessed something that did not live and think. The  story of Othello is a story of jealousy.    One night Iago told Roderigo that Othello had carried off Desdemona  without the knowledge of her father, Brabantio. He persuaded Roderigo  to arouse Brabantio, and when that senator appeared Iago told him  of Desdemona's elopement in the most unpleasant way. Though he was  Othello's officer, he termed him a thief and a Barbary horse.    Brabantio accused Othello before the Duke of Venice of using sorcery to  fascinate his daughter, but Othello said that the only sorcery he used  was his voice, which told Desdemona his adventures and hair-breadth  escapes. Desdemona was led into the council-chamber, and she explained  how she could love Othello despite his almost black face by saying, \"I  saw Othello's visage in his mind.\"    As Othello had married Desdemona, and she was glad to be his wife, there  was no more to be said against him, especially as the Duke wished him to  go to Cyprus to defend it against the Turks. Othello was quite ready to  go, and Desdemona, who pleaded to go with him, was permitted to join him  at Cyprus.    Othello's feelings on landing in this island were intensely joyful. \"Oh,  my sweet,\" he said to Desdemona, who arrived with Iago, his wife, and  Roderigo before him, \"I hardly know what I say to you. I am in love with  my own happiness.\"    News coming presently that the Turkish fleet was out of action, he  proclaimed a festival in Cyprus from five to eleven at night.    Cassio was on duty in the Castle where Othello ruled Cyprus, so Iago  decided to make the lieutenant drink too much. He had some difficulty,  as Cassio knew that wine soon went to his head, but servants brought  wine into the room where Cassio was, and Iago sang a drinking song, and  so Cassio lifted a glass too often to the health of the general.    When Cassio was inclined to be quarrelsome, Iago told Roderigo to say  something unpleasant to him. Cassio cudgeled Roderigo, who ran into the  presence of Montano, the ex-governor. Montano civilly interceded for  Roderigo, but received so rude an answer from Cassio that he said,  \"Come, come, you're drunk!\" Cassio then wounded him, and Iago sent  Roderigo out to scare the town with a cry of mutiny.    The uproar aroused Othello, who, on learning its cause, said, \"Cassio, I  love thee, but never more be officer of mine.\"    On Cassio and Iago being alone together, the disgraced man moaned about  his reputation. Iago said reputation and humbug were the same thing.  \"O God,\" exclaimed Cassio, without heeding him, \"that men should put an  enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!\"    Iago advised him to beg Desdemona to ask Othello to pardon him. Cassio  was pleased with the advice, and next morning made his request to  Desdemona in the garden of the castle. She was kindness itself, and  said, \"Be merry, Cassio, for I would rather die than forsake your  cause.\"    Cassio at that moment saw Othello advancing with Iago, and retired  hurriedly.    Iago said, \"I don't like that.\"    \"What did you say?\" asked Othello, who felt that he had meant something  unpleasant, but Iago pretended he had said nothing. \"Was not that Cassio  who went from my wife?\" asked Othello, and Iago, who knew that it was  Cassio and why it was Cassio, said, \"I cannot think it was Cassio who  stole away in that guilty manner.\"    Desdemona told Othello that it was grief and humility which made Cassio  retreat at his approach. She reminded him how Cassio had taken his part  when she was still heart-free, and found fault with her Moorish lover.  Othello was melted, and said, \"I will deny thee nothing,\" but Desdemona  told him that what she asked was as much for his good as dining.    Desdemona left the garden, and Iago asked if it was really true that  Cassio had known Desdemona before her marriage.    \"Yes,\" said Othello.    \"Indeed,\" said Iago, as though something that had mystified him was now  very clear.    \"Is he not honest?\" demanded Othello, and Iago repeated the adjective  inquiringly, as though he were afraid to say \"No.\"    \"What do you mean?\" insisted Othello.    To this Iago would only say the flat opposite of what he said to Cassio.  He had told Cassio that reputation was humbug. To Othello he said, \"Who  steals my purse steals trash, but he who filches from me my good name  ruins me.\"    At this Othello almost leapt into the air, and Iago was so confident  of his jealousy that he ventured to warn him against it. Yes, it was no  other than Iago who called jealousy \"the green-eyed monster which doth  mock the meat it feeds on.\"    Iago having given jealousy one blow, proceeded to feed it with the  remark that Desdemona deceived her father when she eloped with Othello.  \"If she deceived him, why not you?\" was his meaning.    Presently Desdemona re-entered to tell Othello that dinner was ready.  She saw that he was ill at ease. He explained it by a pain in his  forehead. Desdemona then produced a handkerchief, which Othello  had given her. A prophetess, two hundred years old, had made this  handkerchief from the silk of sacred silkworms, dyed it in a  liquid prepared from the hearts of maidens, and embroidered it with  strawberries. Gentle Desdemona thought of it simply as a cool, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#19)"],[1,"walls of Mantua.[43]    As a matter of fact, the French army was at that time so disorganized  by rapine as scarcely to have withstood a combined and vigorous attack  by Beaulieu and Colli. The republicans, long exposed to hunger and  privations, were now revelling in the fertile plains of Piedmont.  Large bands of marauders ranged the neighbouring country, and the  regiments were often reduced to mere companies. From the grave risks  of this situation Bonaparte was rescued by the timidity of the Court  of Turin, which signed the armistice at Cherasco eighteen days after  the commencement of the campaign. A fortnight later the preliminaries  of peace were signed between France and the King of Sardinia, by which  the latter yielded up his provinces of Savoy and Nice, and renounced  the alliance with Austria. Great indignation was felt in the  Imperialist camp at this news; and it was freely stated that the  Piedmontese had let themselves be beaten in order to compass a peace  that had been tacitly agreed upon in the month of January.[44]    Even before this auspicious event, Bonaparte's despatches to the  Directors were couched in almost imperious terms, which showed that he  felt himself the master of the situation. He advised them as to their  policy towards Sardinia, pointing out that, as Victor Amadeus had  yielded up three important fortresses, he was practically in the hands  of the French: \"If you do not accept peace with him, if your plan is  to dethrone him, you must amuse him for a few decades[45] and must  warn me: I then seize Valenza and march on Turin.\" In military  affairs the young general showed that he would brook no interference  from Paris. He requested the Directory to draft 15,000 men from  Kellermann's Army of the Alps to reinforce him: \"That will give me an  army of 45,000 men, of which possibly I may send a part to Rome. If  you continue your confidence and approve these plans, I am sure of  success: Italy is yours.\" Somewhat later, the Directors proposed to  grant the required reinforcements, but stipulated for the retention of  part of the army in the Milanese _under the command of Kellermann_.  Thereupon Bonaparte replied (May 14th) that, as the Austrians had been  reinforced, it was highly impolitic to divide the command. Each  general had his own way of making war. Kellermann, having more  experience, would doubtless do it better: but both together would do  it very badly.    Again the Directors had blundered. In seeking to subject Bonaparte to  the same rules as had been imposed on all French generals since the  treason of Dumouriez in 1793, they were doubtless consulting the vital  interests of the Commonwealth. But, while striving to avert all  possibilities of Caesarism, they now sinned against that elementary  principle of strategy which requires unity of design in military  operations. Bonaparte's retort was unanswerable, and nothing more was  heard of the luckless proposal.    Meanwhile the peace with the House of Savoy had thrown open the  Milanese to Bonaparte's attack. Holding three Sardinian fortresses, he  had an excellent base of operations; for the lands restored to the  King of Sardinia were to remain subject to requisitions for the French  army until the general peace. The Austrians, on the other hand, were  weakened by the hostility of their Italian subjects, and, worst of  all, they depended ultimately on reinforcements drawn from beyond the  Alps by way of Mantua. In the rich plains of Lombardy they, however,  had one advantage which was denied to them among the rocks of the  Apennines. Their generals could display the tactical skill on which  they prided themselves, and their splendid cavalry had some chance of  emulating the former exploits of the Hungarian and Croatian horse.  They therefore awaited the onset of the French, little dismayed by  recent disasters, and animated by the belief that their antagonist,  unversed in regular warfare, would at once lose in the plains the  bubble reputation gained in ravines. But the country in the second  part of this campaign was not less favourable to Bonaparte's peculiar  gifts than that in which he had won his first laurels as commander.  Amidst the Apennines, where only small bodies of men could be moved, a  general inexperienced in the handling of cavalry and infantry could  make his first essays in tactics with fair chances of success. Speed,  energy, and the prompt seizure of a commanding central position were  the prime requisites; the handling of vast masses of men was  impossible. The plains of Lombardy facilitated larger movements; but  even here the numerous broad swift streams fed by the Alpine snows,  and the network of irrigating dykes, favoured the designs of a young  and daring leader who saw how to use natural obstacles so as to baffle  and ensnare his foes. Bonaparte was now to show that he excelled his  enemies, not only in quickness of eye and vigour of intellect, but  also in the minutiae of tactics and in those larger strategic  conceptions which decide the fate of nations. In the first place,  having the superiority of force, he was able to attack. This is an  advantage at all times: for the aggressor can generally mislead his  adversary by a series of feints until the real blow can be delivered  with crushing effect. Such has been the aim of all great leaders from  the time of Epaminondas and Alexander, Hannibal and Caesar, down to the  age of Luxembourg, Marlborough, and Frederick the Great. Aggressive  tactics were particularly suited to the French soldiery, always eager,  active, and intelligent, and now endowed with boundless enthusiasm in  their cause and in their leader.    Then again he was fully aware of the inherent vice of the Austrian  situation. It was as if an unwieldy organism stretched a vulnerable  limb across the huge barrier of the Alps, exposing it to the attack of  a compacter body. It only remained for Bonaparte to turn against his  foes the smaller geographical features on which they too implicitly  relied. Beaulieu had retired beyond the Po and the Ticino, expecting  that the attack on the Milanese would be delivered across the latter  stream by the ordinary route, which crossed it at Pavia. Near that  city the Austrians occupied a strong position with 26,000 men, while  other detachments patrolled the banks of the Ticino further north, and  those of the Po towards Valenza, only 5,000 men being sent towards  Piacenza. Bonaparte, however, was not minded to take the ordinary  route. He determined to march, not as yet on the north of the River  Po, where snow-swollen streams coursed down from the Alps, but rather  on the south side, where the Apennines throw off fewer streams and  also of smaller volume. From the fortress of Tortona he could make a  rush at Piacenza, cross the Po there, and thus gain the Milanese  almost without a blow. To this end he had stipulated in the recent  terms of peace that he might cross the Po at Valenza; and now, amusing  his foes by feints on that side, he vigorously pushed his main columns  along the southern bank of the Po, where they gathered up all the  available boats. The vanguard, led by the impetuous Lannes, seized the  ferry at Piacenza, before the Austrian horse appeared, and scattered a  squadron or two which strove to drive them back into the river (May  7th).    Time was thus gained for a considerable number of French to cross the  river in boats or by the ferry. Working under the eye of their leader,  the French conquered all obstacles: a bridge of boats soon spanned  the stream, and was defended by a _tete de pont_; and with forces  about equal in number to Liptay's Austrians, the republicans advanced  northwards, and, after a tough struggle, dislodged their foes from the  village of Fombio. This success drove a solid wedge between Liptay and  his commander-in-chief, who afterwards bitterly blamed him, first for  retreating, and secondly for not reporting his retreat to  headquarters.    It would appear, however, that Liptay had only 5,000 men (not the  8,000 which Napoleon and French historians have credited to him), that  he was sent by Beaulieu to Piacenza too late to prevent the crossing  by the French, and that at the close of the fight on the following day  he was completely cut off from communicating with his superior.  Beaulieu, with his main force, advanced on Fombio, stumbled on the  French, where he looked to find Liptay, and after a confused fight  succeeded in disengaging himself and withdrawing towards Lodi, where  the high-road leading to Mantua crossed the River Adda. To that stream  he directed his remaining forces to retire. He thereby left Milan  uncovered (except for the garrison which held the citadel), and  abandoned more than the half of Lombardy; but, from the military point  of view, his retreat to the Adda was thoroughly sound. Yet here again  a movement strategically correct was marred by tactical blunders. Had  he concentrated all his forces at the nearest point of the Adda which  the French could cross, namely Pizzighetone, he would have rendered  any flank march of theirs to the northward extremely hazardous; but he  had not yet sufficiently learned from his terrible teacher the need of  concentration; and, having at least three passages to guard, he kept  his forces too spread out to oppose a vigorous move against any one of  them. Indeed, he despaired of holding the line of the Adda, and  retired eastwards with a great part of his army.    Consequently, when Bonaparte, only three days after the seizure of  Piacenza, threw his almost undivided force against the town of Lodi,  his passage was disputed only by the rearguard, whose anxiety to cover  the retreat of a belated detachment far exceeded their determination  to defend the bridge over the Adda. This was a narrow structure, some  eighty fathoms long, standing high above the swift but shallow river.  Resolutely held by well-massed troops and"]]]
