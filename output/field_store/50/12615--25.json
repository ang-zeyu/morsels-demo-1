You will enter if it is God's Will.\" I was going to speak  again, when the Noble Guards motioned to me. As I paid little  attention they came forward, the Vicar-General with them, for I  was still kneeling before the Pope with my hands resting on his  knee. Just as I was forced to rise, the dear Holy Father gently  placed his hand on my lips, then lifted it to bless me, letting  his eyes follow me for quite a long time.    My Father was much distressed to find me coming from the audience  in tears; he had passed out before me, and so did not know  anything about my request. The Vicar-General had shown him unusual  kindness, presenting him to Leo XIII as the father of two  Carmelites. The Sovereign Pontiff, as a special sign of  benevolence, had placed his hand on his head, thus appearing in  the name of Christ Himself to mark him with a mysterious seal. But  now that this father of _four_ Carmelites is in Heaven, it is no  longer the hand of Christ's Vicar which rests on his brow,  prophesying his martyrdom: it is the hand of the Spouse of  Virgins, of the King of Heaven; and this Divine Hand will never be  taken away from the head which it has blessed.    This trial was indeed a heavy one, but I must admit that in spite  of my tears I felt a deep inward peace, for I had made every  effort in my power to respond to the appeal of my Divine Master.  This peace, however, dwelt in the depths of my soul--on the  surface all was bitterness; and Jesus was silent--absent it would  seem, for nothing revealed that He was there.    On that day, too, the sun dared not shine, and the beautiful blue  sky of Italy, hidden by dark clouds, mingled its tears with mine.  All was at an end. My journey had no further charm for me since it  had failed in its object. It is true the Holy Father's words: \"You  will enter if it is God's Will,\" should have consoled me, they  were indeed a prophecy. In spite of all these obstacles, what God  in His goodness willed, has come to pass. He has not allowed His  creatures to do what they will but only what He wills. Sometime  before this took place I had offered myself to the Child Jesus to  be His little plaything. I told Him not to treat me like one of  those precious toys which children only look at and dare not  touch, but to treat me like a little ball of no value, that could  be thrown on the ground, kicked about, pierced, left in a corner,  or pressed to His Heart just as it might please Him. In a word I  wished to amuse the Holy child and to let Him play with me as He  fancied. Here indeed He was answering my prayer. In Rome Jesus  pierced His little plaything. He wanted to see what was inside  . . . and when satisfied, He let it drop and went to sleep. What  was  He doing during His sweet slumber, and what became of the ball  thus cast on one side? He dreamed that He was still at play, that  He took it up or threw it down, that He rolled it far away, but at  last He pressed it to His Heart, nor did He allow it again to slip  from His tiny Hand. Dear Mother, you can imagine the sadness of  the little ball lying neglected on the ground! And yet it  continued to hope against hope.    After our audience my Father went to call on Brother Simeon--the  founder and director of St. Joseph's College--and there he met  Father Reverony. He reproached him gently for not having helped me  in my difficult task, and told the whole story to Brother Simeon.  The good old man listened with much interest and even made notes,  saying with evident feeling: \"This kind of thing is not seen in  Italy.\"    The next day we started for Naples and Pompeii. Vesuvius did us  the honour of emitting from its crater a thick volume of smoke,  accompanied by numerous loud reports. The traces of the  devastation of Pompeii are terrifying. They show forth the power  of God: \"He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He  toucheth the mountains and they smoke.\"    I should like to have wandered alone among its ruins, meditating  on the instability of human things, but such solitude was not to  be thought of.    At Naples we made an expedition to the monastery of San Martino;  it crowns a high hill overlooking the whole city. On the way back  the horses took the bit in their teeth, and it is solely to our  Guardian Angels that I attribute our safe return to the splendid  hotel. This word \"splendid\" is not too strong to describe it; in  fact during the whole journey we stayed only at the most expansive  hotels. I had never been surrounded by such luxury, but it is  indeed a true saying that riches do not make happiness. I should  have been a thousand times more contented under a thatched room,  with the hope of entering the Carmel, than I was amid marble  staircases, gilded ceilings, and silken hangings, with my heart  full of sorrow.    I realised thoroughly that joy is not found in the things which  surround us, but lives only in the soul. One could possess it as  well in an obscure prison as in the palace of a king. And so now I  am happier at the Carmel, in the midst of trials within and  without, than I was in the world where I had everything I wanted,  and, above all, the joys of a happy home.    Although I felt heavy of heart, outwardly I was as usual, for I  thought no one had any knowledge of my petition to the Pope. I was  mistaken. One day, when the other pilgrims had gone to the  refreshment-room and Celine and I were alone, Mgr. Legoux came to  the door of the carriage. He looked at me attentively and smiling  said: \"Well, and how is our little Carmelite?\" This showed me that  my secret was known to all the pilgrims, and I gathered it, too,  from their kindly looks; but happily no one spoke to me on the  subject.    At Assisi I had a little adventure. While visiting the places  sanctified by the virtues of St. Francis and St. Clare I lost the  buckle of my belt in the monastery. It took me some time to find  and put it back in place, and when I reached the door all the  carriages had started except one; that belonged to the  Vicar-General of Bayeux! Should I run after those which were no  longer in sight and so perhaps miss the train, or should I beg for  a seat in the carriage of Father Reverony? I decided that this was  the wiser plan.    I tried to hide my extreme embarrassment and explained things. He  was placed in a difficulty himself, for all the seats were  occupied, but one of the party promptly gave me his place and sat  by the driver. I felt like a squirrel caught in a snare. I was ill  at ease in the midst of these great people, and I had to sit face  to face with the most formidable of all. He was exceedingly kind,  however, and now and then interrupted his conversation to talk to  me about the Carmel and promise that he would do all in his power  to realise my desire of entering at fifteen. This meeting was like  balm to my wounds, though it did not prevent me from suffering. I  had now lost all trust in creatures and could only lean on God  Himself.    And yet my distress did not hinder me from taking a deep interest  in the holy places we visited. In Florence we saw the shrine of  St. Mary Magdalen of Pazzi, in the choir of the Carmelite Church.  All the pilgrims wanted to touch the Saint's tomb with their  Rosaries, but my hand was the only one small enough to pass  through the grating. So I was deputed for this important and  lengthy task, and I did it with pride.    It was not the first time I had obtained special favours. One day,  at _Santa Croce,_ in Rome, we venerated the relics of the True  Cross, together with two of the Thorns, and one of the Sacred  Nails. I wanted to examine them closely, so I remained behind, and  when the monk in charge was going to replace them on the Altar, I  asked if I might touch the precious treasures. He said I might do  so, but was doubtful if I should succeed; however, I put my little  finger into one of the openings of the reliquary and was able to  touch the Sacred Nail once hallowed by the Blood of Our Saviour.  You see I behaved towards Him like a child who thinks it may do as  it pleases and looks on its Father's treasures as its own.    Having passed through Pisa and Genoa we came back to France by one  of the loveliest routes. At times we were close to the sea, and  one day during a storm it seemed as though the waves would reach  the train. Farther on we travelled through plains covered with  orange trees, olives, and feathery palms, while at night the  numerous seaports twinkled with lights, and stars came out in the  deep blue sky. But I watched the fairy picture fade away from my  eyes without any regret--my heart was set elsewhere.    My Father proposed to take me to Jerusalem, but in spite of the  natural wish I had to visit the places sanctified by Our Lord's  Footsteps, I was weary of earthly pilgrimages and only longed for  the beauties of Heaven. In order to win these beauties for souls I  wanted to become a prisoner as quickly as possible. I felt that I  must suffer and struggle still more before the gates of my blessed  prison would open; yet my trust in God did not grow less, and I  still hoped to enter at Christmas.    We had hardly reached home when I paid a visit to the Carmel. You  must remember well that interview, dear Mother. I left myself  entirely in your hands, for I had exhausted all my resources. You  told me to write to the Bishop and remind him of his promise. I  obeyed at once, and as soon as my letter was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#19)"],[1,"m, but keeping up a continuity of wet  spaces.  When all is wet, cross them by another set of strokes from  above downwards, so managing the brush as to leave no floating liquid  on the paper.  It must then be dried as quickly as possible over a  stove, or in a warm current of air, avoiding, however, such heat as may  injure the tint.    In addition to the flowers already mentioned in my third chapter, the  following are among those experimented upon and found to give tolerable  good photographic sensitives.  I can only enumerate them, referring the  student, for any further information he may desire on the subject, to  Mr. Hunt's work; although what I have said above is sufficient for all  practical purposes; and any one, with the ambition, can readily  experiment upon them, without further research, on any other flower he  may choose.    Viola Odorata--or sweet sented violet, yields to alcohol a rich blue  color, which it imparts in high perfection to paper    Senecio Splendens--or double purple groundsel, yields a beautiful color  to paper.    The leaves of the laurel, common cabbage, and the grasses, are found  sufficiently sensitive.    Common Merrigold yields an invaluable faecula, which appears identical  with that produced by the Wall-flower, and Cochorus japonica mentioned  before, and is very sensitive, but photographs procured upon it cannot  be preserved, the color is so fugitive.    From an examination of the researches of Sir John Herschel on the  coloring matter of plants, it will be seen that the action of the sun's  rays is to destroy the color, effecting a sort of chromatic analysis,  in which two distinct elements of color are separated, by destroying  the one and leaving the other outstanding.  The action is confined  within the visible spectrum, and thus a broad distinction is exhibited  between the action of the sun's rays on vegetable juices and on  argentine compounds, the latter being most sensibly affected by the  invisible rays beyond the violet.    It may also be observed, that the rays effective in destroying a given  tint, are in a great many cases, those whose union produces a color  complementary to the tint destroyed, or, at least, one belonging to  that class of colors to which such complementary tint may be preferred.  For instance, yellows tending towards orange are destroyed with more  energy by the blue rays; blues by the red, orange and yellow rays;  purples and pinks by yellow and green rays.      V. AMPHITYPE.    This process is a discovery of Sir John Herschel and receives its name  from the fact that both negative and positive photographs can be  produced by one process.  The positive pictures obtained by it have a  perfect resemblance to impressions of engravings with common printer's  ink.  The process, although not yet fully carried out, promises to be  of vast utility.    Paper proper for producing an amphitype picture may be prepared either  with the ferro-tartrate or the ferro-citrate of the protoxide, or the  peroxide of mercury, or of the protoxide of lead, by using creams of  these salts, or by successive applications of the nitrates of the  respective oxides, singly or in mixture, to the paper, alternating with  solutions of the ammonia-tartrate or the ammonia-citrate of iron, the  latter solution being last applied, and in more or less excess.  I  purposely avoid stating proportions, as I have not yet been able to fix  upon any which certainly succeed.  Paper so prepared and dried takes a  negative picture, in a time varying from half an hour to five or six  hours, according to the intensity of the light; and the impression  produced varies in apparent force from a faint and hardly perceptible  picture to one of the highest conceivable fulness and richness both of  tint and detail, the color being in this case a superb velvety brown.  This extreme richness of effect is not produced unless lead be present,  either in the ingredients used, or in the paper itself.  It is not, as  I originally supposed, due to the presence of free tartaric acid.  The  pictures in this state are not permanent.  They fade in the dark,  though with very different degrees of rapidity, some (especially if  free tartaric or citric acid be present) in a few days, while others  remain for weeks unimpaired, and require whole years for their total  obliteration.  But though entirely faded out in appearance, the picture  is only rendered dormant, and may be restored, changing its character  from negative to positive, and its colors from brown to black, (in the  shadows), by the following process:--A bath being prepared by pouring a  small quantity of solution of pernitrate of mercury into a large  quantity of water, and letting the subnitrated precipitates subside,  the picture may be immersed in it, (carefully and repeatedly clearing  off all air bubbles,) and allowed to remain till the picture (if any  where visible,) is entirely destroyed; or if faded, till it is judged  sufficient from previous experience; a term which is often marked by  the appearance of a feeble positive picture, of a bright yellow hue, on  the pale yellow ground of the paper.  A long time (several weeks) is  often required for this, but heat accelerates the action, and it is  often completed in a few hours.  In this state the picture is to be  very thoroughly rinsed and soaked in pure warm water, and then dried.  It is then to be well ironed with a smooth iron, heated so as barely  not to injure the paper, placing it, for greater security against  scorching, between clean smooth paper.  If then the process have been  successful, a perfectly black positive picture is at once developed.  At first it most commonly happens that the whole picture is sooty or  dingy to such a degree that it is condemned as spoiled, but on keeping  it between the leaves of a book, especially in a moist atmosphere, by  extremely slow degrees this dinginess disappears, and the picture  disengages itself with continually increasing sharpness and clearness,  and acquires the exact effect of a copper-plate engraving on a paper  more or less tinted with a pale yellow.    I ought to observe, that the best and most uniform specimens which I  have procured have been on paper previously washed with certain  preparations of uric acid, which is a very remarkable and powerful  photographic element.  The intensity of the original negative picture  is no criterion of what may be expected in the positive.  It is from  the production by one and the same action of light, of either a  positive or negative picture according to the subsequent manipulations,  that I have designated the process, thus generally sketched out, by the  term Amphitype,--a name suggested by Mr. Talbot, to whom I communicated  this singular result; and to this process or class of processes (which  I cannot doubt when pursued will lead to some very beautiful results,)  I propose to restrict the name in question, though it applies even more  appropriately to the following exceedingly curious and remarkable one,  in which silver is concerned:    At the last meeting I announced a mode of producing, by means of a  solution of silver, in conjunction with ferro-tartaric acid, a dormant  picture brought into a forcible negative impression by the breath or  moist air.  (See Cyanotype.) The solution then described, and which had  at that time been prepared some weeks, I may here incidentally remark,  has retained its limpidity and photogenic properties, quite unimpaired  during the whole year since elapsed, and is now as sensitive as  ever,--a property of no small value.  Now, when a picture (for example  an impression from an engraving) is taken on paper washed with this  solution, it shows no sign of a picture on its back, whether that on  its face is developed or not; but if, while the actinic influence is  still fresh upon the face, (i.e., as soon as it is removed from the  light), the back be exposed for a very few seconds to the sunshine, and  then removed to a gloomy place, a positive picture, the exact  complement of the negative one on the other side, though wanting of  course in sharpness if the paper be thick, slowly and gradually makes  its appearance there, and in half an hour or an hour acquires a  considerable intensity.  I ought to mention that the \"ferro-tartaric  acid\" in question is prepared by precipitating the ferro-tartrate of  ammonia (ammonia-tartrate of iron) by acetate of lead, and decomposing  the precipitate by dilute sulphuric acid.  When lead is used in the  preparation of Amphitype paper, the parts upon which the light has  acted are found to be in a very high degree rendered water proof.--Sir  J. Herschel.    This process is a new invention of our countryman, J. A. Whipple, Esq.,  of Boston, and has been patented by M. A. Root, Esq., of Philadelphia.  It will be seen, however, from the previous pages of my work that Mr.  Root is mistaken in regard to his being the first improvement patented  in this country, although it is unquestionably the first by an  American.  Of this improvement Mr. Root says:      VI. \"CRAYON DAGUERREOTYPE.\"    \"The improvement to which you refer is denominated \"The Crayon  Daguerreotype.\"  This invention made by Mr. J. A. Whipple, is the only  improvement in Daguerreotyping, I believe, for which Letters Patent for  the United States were ever issued.  The pictures produced by this  process--which is of the simplest description imaginable--have the  appearance and effect of very fine \"Crayon Drawings,\" from which the  improvement takes its name.  Some of our most distinguished artists  have given it their unqualified admiration.  Among them, our Mezzotinto  Engravers, especially John Sartain, Esq., who, from his rich  embellishments to most of the leading Magazines and Annuals of the  country, as well as from the celebrity of the superb Magazine which  bears his name, is so well known and so well qualified to judge of its  merits.
