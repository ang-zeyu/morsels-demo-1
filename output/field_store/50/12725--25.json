(#19)"],[1,"countrymen at  Repton, they soon found the necessity of separating, in order to provide  for their subsistence. Part of them, under the command of Haldene,  their chieftain,[**] marched into Northumberland, where they fixed  their residence; part of them took quarters at Cambridge, whence they  dislodged in the ensuing summer and seized Wereham, in the county of  Dorset, the very centre of Alfred's dominions. That prince so straitened  them in these quarters, that they were content to come to a treaty with  him, and stipulated to depart his country. Alfred, well acquainted with  their usual perfidy, obliged them to swear upon the holy relics to the  observance of the treaty;[***] not that he expected they would pay any  veneration to the relics; but he hoped that, if they now violated this  oath, their impiety would infallibly draw down upon them the vengeance  of Heaven.         [* Asser. p. 8. Chron. Sax. p. 82. Ethelwerd, lib.       iv. cap. 4.]         [** Chron. Sax. p. 83.]         [*** Asser. p 8.]    But the Danes, little apprehensive of the danger suddenly, without  seeking any pretence, fell upon Alfred's army; and having put it to  rout, marched westward, and took possession of Exeter. The prince  collected new forces, and exerted such vigor, that he fought in one  year eight battles with the enemy,[*] and reduced them to the utmost  extremity. He hearkened, however, to new proposals of peace, and was  satisfied to stipulate with them, that they would settle somewhere in  England,[**] and would not permit the entrance of more ravagers into the  kingdom. But while he was expecting the execution of this treaty, which  it seemed the interest of the Danes themselves to fulfil, he heard that  another body had landed, and, having collected all the scattered troops  of their country men, had surprised Chippenham, then a considerable  town, and were exercising their usual ravages all around them.      This last incident quite broke the spirit of the Saxons, and reduced  them to despair. Finding that, after all the miserable havoc which they  had undergone in their persons and in their property, after all the  vigorous actions which they had exerted in their own defence, a new  band, equally greedy of spoil and slaughter, had disembarked among  them, they believed themselves abandoned by Heaven to destruction, and  delivered over to those swarms of robbers which the fertile north thus  incessantly poured forth against them. Some left their country and  retired into Wales, or fled beyond sea; others submitted to  the conquerors, in hopes of appeasing their fury by a servile  obedience.[***] And every man's attention being now engrossed in concern  for his own preservation, no one would hearken to the exhortations of  the king, who summoned them to make, under his conduct, one effort more  in defence of their prince, their country, and their liberties. Alfred  himself was obliged to relinquish the ensigns of his dignity, to dismiss  his servants, and to seek shelter in the meanest disguises from the  pursuit and fury of his enemies. He concealed himself under a peasant's  habit, and lived some time in the house of a neat-herd, who had been  intrusted with the care of some of his cows.[****]         [* Asser. p. 8. The Saxon Chronicle, p. 82, says       nine battles.]         [** Asser. p. 9. Alured. Beverl. p. 104.]         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 84. Alured. Beverl. p. 105.]         [**** Asser. p. 9.]    There passed here an incident, which has been recorded by all the  historians, and was long preserved by popular tradition, though  it contains nothing memorable in itself, except so far as every  circumstance is interesting which attends so much virtue and dignity  reduced to such distress. The wife of the neat-herd was ignorant of the  condition of her royal guest; and observing him one day busy, by the  fireside, in trimming his bow and arrows, she desired him to take care  of some cakes which were toasting, while she was employed elsewhere  in other domestic affairs. But Alfred, whose thoughts were otherwise  engaged, neglected this injunction; and the good woman, on her return,  finding her cakes all burnt, rated the king very severely, and upbraided  him, that he always seemed very well pleased to eat her warm cakes  though he was thus negligent in toasting them.[*]      By degrees, Alfred, as he found the search of the enemy become more  remiss, collected some of his retainers, and retired into the centre  of a bog, formed by the stagnating waters of the Thone and Parret, in  Somersetshire. He here found two acres of firm ground; and building a  habitation on them, rendered himself secure by its fortifications, and  still more by the unknown and inaccessible roads which led to it, and  by the forests and morasses with which it was every way environed. This  place he called AEthelingay, or the Isle of Nobles;[**] and it now bears  the name of Athelney. He thence made frequent and unexpected sallies  upon the Danes, who often felt the vigor of his arm, but knew not from  what quarter the blow came. He subsisted himself and his followers by  the plunder which he acquired; he procured them consolation by  revenge; and from small successes, he opened their minds to hope that,  notwithstanding his present low condition, more important victories  might at length attend his valor.        [* Asser. p. 9. M. West. p. 170.]        [** Chron. Sax. p. 85. W Malms, lib. ii. cap. 4. Ethelwerd,       lib iv. cap. 4. Ingulph. p. 26.]    Alfred lay here concealed, but not inactive, during a twelvemonth; when  the news of a prosperous event reached his ears, and called him to the  field. Hubba the Dane, having spread devastation, fire, and slaughter  over Wales, had landed in Devonshire from twenty-three vessels, and laid  siege to the castle of Kinwith, a place situated near the mouth of the  small river Tau. Oddune, earl of Devonshire, with his followers, had  taken shelter there; and being ill supplied with provisions, and  even with water, he determined, by some vigorous blow, to prevent the  necessity of submitting to the barbarous enemy. He made a sudden sally  on the Danes before sun-rising; and taking them unprepared, he put them  to rout, pursued them with great slaughter, killed Hubba himself, and  got possession of the famous Reafen, or enchanted standard, in which the  Danes put great confidence.[*] It contained the figure of a raven, which  had been inwoven by the three sisters of Hinguar and Hubba, with  many magical incantations, and which, by its different movements,  prognosticated, as the Danes believed, the good or bad success of any  enterprise.[**]      When Alfred observed this symptom of successful resistance in his  subjects, he left his retreat; but before he would assemble them in  arms, or urge them to any attempt, which, if unfortunate, might, in  their present despondency, prove fatal, he resolved to inspect himself  the situation of the enemy, and to judge of the probability of success.  For this purpose he entered their camp under the disguise of a harper,  and passed unsuspected through every quarter. He so entertained  them with his music and facetious humors, that he met with a welcome  reception, and was even introduced to the tent of Guthrum, their prince,  where he remained some days.[***] He remarked the supine security of the  Danes, their contempt of the English, their negligence in foraging and  plundering, and their dissolute wasting of what they gained by rapine  and violence. Encouraged by these favorable appearances, he secretly  sent emissaries to the most considerable of his subjects, and summoned  them to a rendezvous, attended by their warlike followers, at Brixton,  on the borders of Selwood Forest.[****] The English, who had hoped to  put an end to their calamities by servile submission, now found the  insolence and rapine of the conqueror more intolerable than all past  fatigues and dangers; and at the appointed day, they joyfully resorted  to their prince. On his appearance, they received him with shouts of  applause,[*****] and could not satiate their eyes with the sight of this  beloved monarch, whom they had long regarded as dead, and who now, with  voice and looks expressing his confidence of success, called them to  liberty and to vengeance.        [* Asser. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 84. Abbas Rieval. p. 395.       Alured. Beverl. p. 105.]        [** Asser. p. 10.]        [*** W. Malms, lib. ii. cap. 4.]        [**** Chron Sax. p. 85.]        [***** Asser. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Sim. Dunelm. p. 128.       Alured. Beverl. p. 105. Abbas Rieval. p. 354.]    He instantly conducted them to Eddington, where the Danes were encamped;  and taking advantage of his previous knowledge of the place, he directed  his attack against the most unguarded quarter of the enemy. The Danes,  surprised to see an army of English, whom they considered as totally  subdued, and still more astonished to hear that Alfred was at their  head, made but a faint resistance, notwithstanding their superiority of  number, and were soon put to flight with great slaughter. The remainder  of the routed army, with their prince, was besieged by Alfred in a  fortified camp to which they fled; but being reduced to extremity by  want and hunger, they had recourse to the clemency of the victor, and  offered to submit on any conditions. The king, no less generous than  brave, gave them their lives, and even formed a scheme for converting  them from mortal enemies into faithful subjects and confederates. He  knew that the kingdoms of East Anglia and Northumberland were totally  desolated by the frequent inroads of the Danes, and he now proposed to  repeople them, by settling there Guthrum and his followers. He hoped  that the new planters would at last betake themselves to industry, when,  by reason of his resistance, and the exhausted condition of the country,  they could no longer subsist by plunder; and that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B. (#19)"],[1,"ubject, no one was  more universally complained of than the adulteration of the coin; and as  this crime required more art than the English of that age, who chiefly  employed force and violence in their iniquities, were possessed of, the  imputation fell upon the Jews.[**] Edward also seems to have indulged a  strong prepossession against that nation; and this ill-judged zeal for  Christianity being naturally augmented by an expedition to the Holy  Land, he let loose the whole rigor of his justice against that unhappy  people. Two hundred and eighty of them were hanged at once for this  crime in London alone, besides those who suffered in other parts of the  kingdom.[***]         * Spel. Gloss, in verbo Trailbaston. But Spelman was either       mistaken in placing this commission in the fifth year of the       king, or it was renewed in 1305. See Rymer, vol. ii. p. 960.       Trivet, p. 838., M. West. p. 450.         ** Walsing. p. 48 Heming. vol. i. p. 6.         *** T. Wykes, p. 107.    The houses and lands, (for the Jews had of late ventured to make  purchases of that kind,) as well as the goods of great multitudes, were  sold and confiscated; and the king, lest it should be suspected that the  riches of the sufferers were the chief part of their guilt, ordered a  moiety of the money raised by these confiscations to be set apart, and  bestowed upon such as were willing to be converted to Christianity. But  resentment was more prevalent with them than any temptation from their  poverty; and very few of them could be induced by interest to embrace  the religion of their persecutors. The miseries of this people did not  here terminate. Though the arbitrary talliages and exactions levied upon  them had yielded a constant and a considerable revenue to the crown,  Edward prompted by his zeal and his rapacity, resolved some time  after[*] to purge the kingdom entirely of that hated race, and to seize  to himself at once their whole property as the reward of his labor.[**]  He left them only money sufficient to bear their charges into foreign  countries, where new persecutions and extortions awaited them: but the  inhabitants of the cinque ports, imitating the bigotry and avidity of  their sovereign, despoiled most of them of this small pittance, and even  threw many of them into the sea; a crime for which the king, who was  determined to be the sole plunderer in his dominions, inflicted a  capital punishment upon them. No less than fifteen thousand Jews were at  this time robbed of their effects, and banished the kingdom: very few of  that nation have since lived in England: and as it is impossible for a  nation to subsist without lenders of money, and none will lend without  a compensation, the practice of usury, as it was then called,  was thenceforth exercised by the English themselves upon their  fellow-citizens, or by Lombards and other foreigners. It is very much  to be questioned, whether the dealings of these new usurers were equally  open and unexceptionable with those of the old. By a law of Richard, it  was enacted, that three copies should be made of every bond given to a  Jew; one to be put into the hands of a public magistrate, another  into those of a man of credit, and a third to remain with the Jew  himself.[***] But as the canon law, seconded by the municipal, permitted  no Christian to take interest, all transactions of this kind must, after  the banishment of the Jews, have become more secret and clandestine, and  the lender, of consequence, be paid both for the use of his money, and  for the infamy and danger which he incurred by lending it.         * In the year 1290.         ** Walsing. p. 54. Heming. vol. i. p. 20. Trivet, p 266.         *** Trivet, p. 128.    The great poverty of the crown, though no excuse, was probably the cause  of this egregious tyranny exercised against the Jews; but Edward also  practised other more honorable means of remedying that evil. He employed  a strict frugality in the management and distribution of his revenue: he  engaged the parliament to vote him a fifteenth of all movables; the pope  to grant him the tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues for three years;  and the merchants to consent to a perpetual imposition of half a mark on  every sack of wool exported, and a mark on three hundred skins. He  also issued commissions to inquire into all encroachments on the royal  demesne; into the value of escheats, forfeitures, and Wardships; and  into the means of repairing or improving every branch of the revenue.[*]  The commissioners, in the execution of their office, began to carry  matters too far against the nobility, and to question titles to estates  which had been transmitted from father to son for several generations.  Earl Warrenne, who had done such eminent service in the late reign,  being required to show his titles, drew his sword; and subjoined, that  William the bastard had not conquered the kingdom for himself alone: his  ancestor was a joint adventurer in the enterprise; and he himself was  determined to maintain what had from that period remained unquestioned  in his family. The king, sensible of the danger, desisted from making  further inquiries of this nature.    {1276.} But the active spirit of Edward could not long remain without  employment. He soon after undertook an enterprise more prudent for  himself, and more advantageous to his people. Lewellyn, prince of Wales,  had been deeply engaged with the Mountfort faction; had entered into  all their conspiracies against the crown; had frequently fought on  their side; and, till the battle of Evesham, so fatal to that party, had  employed every expedient to depress the royal cause, and to promote  the success of the barons. In the general accommodation made with the  vanquished, Lewellyn had also obtained his pardon; but as he was the  most powerful, and therefore the most obnoxious vassal of the crown, he  had reason to entertain anxiety about his situation, and to dread the  future effects of resentment and jealousy in the English monarch. For  this reason he determined to provide for his security by maintaining a  secret correspondence with his former associates; and he even made his  addresses to a daughter of the earl of Leicester, who was sent to him  from beyond sea, but being intercepted in her passage near the Isles of  Scilly, was detained in the court of England.[**]         * Ann. Waverl.p. 235.         ** Walsing. p. 46, 47. Heming. vol. i. p. 5. Trivet, p. 248    This incident increasing the mutual jealousy between Edward and  Lewellyn, the latter, when required to come to England, and do homage to  the new king, scrupled to put himself in the hands of an enemy, desired  a safe-conduct from Edward, insisted upon having the king's son and  other noblemen delivered to him as hostages, and demanded that his  consort should previously be set at liberty.[*] The king, having now  brought the state to a full settlement, was not displeased with  this occasion of exercising his authority, and subduing entirely the  principality of Wales. He refused all Lewellyn's demands, except that  of a safe-conduct; sent him repeated summons to perform the duty of a  vassal; levied an army to reduce him to obedience; obtained a new aid of  a fifteenth from parliament; and marched out with certain assurance of  success against the enemy.    {1277.} Besides the great disproportion of force between the kingdom  and the principality, the circumstances of the two states were entirely  reversed; and the same intestine dissensions which had formerly weakened  England, now prevailed in Wales, and had even taken place in the  reigning family. David and Roderic, brothers to Lewellyn, dispossessed  of their inheritance by that prince, had been obliged to have recourse  to the protection of Edward, and they seconded with all their interest,  which was extensive, his attempts to enslave their native country. The  Welsh prince had no resource but in the inaccessible situation of  his mountains, which had hitherto, through many ages, defended his  forefathers against all attempts of the Saxon and Norman conquerors; and  he retired among the hills of Snowdun, resolute to defend himself to the  last extremity. But Edward, equally vigorous and cautious, entering by  the north with a formidable army, pierced into the heart of the country;  and having carefully explored every road before him, and secured every  pass behind him, approached the Welsh army in its last retreat. He here  avoided the putting to trial the valor of a nation proud of its ancient  independence, and inflamed with animosity against its hereditary  enemies; and he trusted to the slow, but sure effects of famine, for  reducing that people to subjection. The rude and simple manners of the  natives, as well as the mountainous situation of their country, had made  them entirely neglect tillage, and trust to pasturage alone for their  subsistence; a method of life which had hitherto[*] secured them against  the irregular attempts of the English, out exposed them to certain ruin,  when the conquest of the country was steadily pursued, and prudently  planned by Edward. Destitute of magazines, cooped up in a narrow corner,  they, as well as their cattle, suffered all the rigors of famine; and  Lewellyn, without being able to strike a stroke for his independence,  was at last obliged to submit at discretion, and receive the terms  imposed upon him by the victor.[**] He bound himself to pay to Edward  fifty thousand pounds, as a reparation of damages; to do homage to the  crown of England; to permit all the other barons of Wales, except four  near Snowdun, to swear fealty to the same crown; to relinquish the  country between Cheshire and the River Conway; to settle on his brother  Roderic a thousand marks a year, and on David five hundred; and to  deliver ten hostages as security for his future submission.[***]    Edward, on the performance of the other"]]]
