Our  artillery could not locate their main force with any degree of certainty,  nor could they place us properly. They were not idle; their guns, of which  they had a decent number, sought for our position with dauntless  perseverance. Their shells soon began to drop amongst us, but they did no  harm at all. They fell close enough to our troops in many instances, but  they were so badly made that they would not explode, or if they did they  simply fizzed, and were almost as harmless as seidlitz powders.    The spiteful little pom-poms cracked away and kept us on the alert, until  one grew weary of the everlasting noise of cannon. At mid-day, tired of the  monotony of the game, I turned my horse's head towards camp, and, in  company with three other correspondents, soon sat down to a lunch of  mealies and boiled fowl; but we were destined not to enjoy that meal, for  before the first mouthful had left my plate there came a wailing howl  through the air, then a strange jarring noise, and a shell plunged into the  earth forty yards away from the tent. A few minutes later another visitor  from the same direction crashed on top of one of the transport waggons  within a stone's throw of our tent. That decided me; in a few seconds I had  scrambled up the side of a kopje, with the leg of a fowl in one hand and a  soldier's biscuit in the other. The shells had not burst, but no man could  say when one would, and I had no particular interest in regard to the  inside of any shell myself. I was not the only one who made a hasty exit  from the camp; in ten seconds the side of the kopje was alive with men. The  shells continued to fall right amongst the waggons every few minutes for  over two hours; yet only one man was killed, a negro driver being the  victim, a shell dropping right against his thigh. The range of the Boer gun  was absolutely perfect, but the shells were mere rubbish. Had they been as  good as ours, half our transport would have been in ruins. The British  gunners manoeuvred in all directions in order to locate that particularly  dangerous piece of ordnance. They blazed at it in batteries; they tried to  find it by means of cross-firing; they lined men up on the sky-line of  kopjes to draw the fire; they limbered up and galloped far out on the  veldt, until the enemy's rifle fire drove them in again; but all in vain.  The Boer leader had placed his gun with such skill that the British could  not locate it, and it kept up its devilish jubilee until the night set in.    That day our scouts captured one Free State flag from the enemy; the  Yeomanry and mounted infantry did not succeed in their efforts to turn the  Boers' left flank, but they checked the enemy from advancing in that  direction, which was an important item in the day's work. We did not want  the Boer left to overlap our right; had they done so they could then get  behind us and harass our convoys coming from the direction of Bethany  railway station. We had very little dread of them turning our left flank,  because we knew that General French was moving towards us on that side from  Bloemfontein, with the object of getting the Boers on the inside of two  forces, and so giving them no chance of escape. We had only a few men  wounded, one petty officer of the Scouts killed, and a negro driver killed,  which was simply marvellous when one considers the terrible amount of  ammunition used during the day. That night all the correspondents had to  sleep, or try to sleep, with the transport. It was a wretched night; we  knew the Boers had the range, and we fully expected to get a hot shelling  between darkness and dawn, but, curiously enough, the foe kept their guns  still all the night But the suspense made the night a weary one.    The following day was Sunday, and at a very early hour our scouts informed  us that the Boers had made a wide detour towards Wepener, and had  overlapped our right flank. They slipped up into a kopje, which would have  enabled them to enfilade our position in a most masterly manner; but before  they could get their guns there our artillery was at them, and the kopje  was literally ploughed up with shells. It was too warm a corner for any man  on earth to attempt to hold, and they soon took their departure, falling  back in good order, and leaving no dead or wounded behind them. The  Yeomanry had advanced on the kopje, under the protection of the shell  firing, and when close to the position they fixed bayonets and dashed up  the hill; but when they topped it they found that the Boers had retired. It  was a quick bit of work, neatly and expeditiously done. Had the Boers held  the hill long enough to get their guns in position they would have played  havoc with us, for they could then have swept our whole line. From morning  until night-fall we kept at them with our big guns; whenever a cloud of  dust arose from behind a range of kopjes we dropped shells in the middle of  it; wherever a cluster of Boers showed themselves for a second a shell  sought them out. No matter how well they were placed, they must have had a  lively time of it. During the Sabbath they scarcely used their guns at all,  but they opened on our troops with rifle fire as soon as they made a  forward move at any part of the line, showing clearly that they were  watching as well as praying. The day closed without incident of any  particular character; we had a few wounded, but no deaths, and could form  no idea how the Boers were faring. Now and again during the night one or  another of our guns would bark like sullen watchdogs on the chain, but the  Boer guns were still.    Monday morning broke crisp and clear, and once more the big-gun duel began,  only on this occasion the Boers made great use of a pom-pom gun This  spiteful little demon tossed its diminutive shells into camp with painful  freeness. They knocked three of the Worcesters over early in the day,  killing two and badly damaging the other. As on all other occasions in this  peculiar engagement, the Boer gunnery was simply superb; but their shells  were worthless. Shells grew so common that the \"Tommies\" scarcely ducked  when they heard the report of a gun they knew was trying to reach them, but  smoked their pipes and made irreverent remarks concerning things made in  Germany. About midday a party of Boers, who had somehow dodged round to our  rear, made a dashing attempt to raid some cattle that were grazing close  under our eyes; but they had to vanish in a hurry, and were particularly  lucky in being able to escape with their lives, for a party of scouts  darted out after them at full gallop on one side, whilst another party of  mounted infantry rode as hard as hoofs could carry them on the other side  of the bold raiders. They unslung their rifles as they dashed across the  veldt, and the Boers soon knew that the fellows behind them were as much at  home as they were themselves at that kind of business.    Late on Monday evening the Boers located a little to the left of our centre  moved forward a bit. Though with infinite caution, and commenced sniping  with the rifle. It was an evidence that they were growing weary of our  tactics, and would greatly have liked us to attempt to rush their position  with the bayonet, so that they could have mowed our fellows down in  hundreds. But this General Rundle wisely declined to do; it was victory,  not glory, he was seeking, and he was wise enough to know that a victory  can be bought at far too high a price in country of this kind against a foe  like the wily Boer. On Sunday night our strength was augmented by the  arrival of three regiments of the Guards, and on Monday night we, knew for  a certainty that General French was close at hand. The Boer was between two  fires, and he would need all his \"slimness\" to pull him out of trouble.  During a greater part of the night our guns continued to rob sleep of its  sweetness, and the enemy's pom-pom mingled with our dreams. On Tuesday  morning news came to us that Wepener had been relieved by Brabant and Hart,  and that the Boers who had invested that place were drawing off in our  direction, so that our right flank needed strengthening. The Boers  displayed no sign of quitting their position, though they must have known  that Brabant and Hart would be on their track from the south-east, and  General French from the north-west. They held their ground with a grim  stubbornness against overwhelming odds of men and guns, and dropped shells  amongst us in a way that made one feel that no spot could be labelled  \"absolutely safe.\"    At about 7 p.m. we sent a force out south, consisting of about 4,000 men,  under General Boyes. Amongst that force were the West Kents, Staffords,  Worcesters, Manchesters, all infantry. The Imperial Yeomanry and mounted  infantry also accompanied the expedition. But there was little for them to  do except hold the enemy in check, which they did. There were some  phenomenally close shaves during the day. On one occasion the enemy got the  range of one of our guns with their pom-pom, and the way they dropped the  devilish little one-pound shells amongst those gunners was a sight to make  a man's blood run chill. The little iron imps fell between the men, grazed  the wheels, the carriage, and the truck of the gun; but              He, watching over Israel, slumbers not nor sleeps.    Nothing short of angel-wings could have kept our fellows safe. The men knew  their deadly peril, knew that the tip of the wand in the Death Angel's hand  was brushing their cheeks. One could see that they knew their peril. The  hard, firm grip of the jaw, the steady light in the hard-set eyes, the  manly pallor on the cheeks, all told of knowledge; yet not once did they  lose their heads.

Old Mr. Owl stared up  in wide-eyed astonishment, and then and there fell in love with her,  and resolved to ask her to be his wife.    Cramming on his spectacles more tightly and ruffling the feathers about  his neck, he flew up and up and up, as high as ever he dared to go,  until he was within hailing distance of the moon. Then he called out in  his softest tones,--which were harsh enough to any ears,--    \"O fair Moon-Maiden, O beautiful Princess, will you marry me? For I love  you very dearly.\"    The Princess Putri Balan stopped chewing her betel-nut for a moment and  looked down to see what daring creature might thus be addressing her.  Soon she spied Mr. Owl with his goggle-eyes looking up at her adoringly.  He was such a ridiculous old creature, and his spectacles glinted so  queerly in the moonlight, that Putri Balan began to laugh and answered  him not at all. She laughed so hard that she almost swallowed her  betel-nut, which might have been a serious matter.    Mr. Owl continued to stare, for he saw nothing funny in the situation.  Again he repeated in his hoarse voice, \"O fair Moon-Maiden, O beautiful  Princess, will you marry me? For I love you very dearly.\"    Again the Princess laughed, for she thought it a tremendous joke; and  again she nearly choked. Mr. Owl waited, but she made him no other  answer. However, he was a persistent lover. All night long he went on  asking the same question, over and over again, until the Princess Putri  Balan was quite worn out trying not to choke with laughter while she  chewed the betel-nut. At last she said impatiently,--    \"O Mr. Goggle-Eyes! Do give me a moment's peace! You make me laugh so  that I cannot chew my betel-nut. Yes, I will say _yes_, if you will only  leave me to finish my betel-nut undisturbed. I will marry you. But you  must go away until I have quite done.\"    Then Mr. Owl was filled with joy. \"Thanks, thanks, O most gracious  lady!\" he said. \"I will go away and leave you to finish your betel-nut  undisturbed. But I shall come again to-morrow night, and by that time  you will have done with it, and then you will be mine!\"    Mr. Owl flew back to his home in the hollow tree, for it was almost  morning, and already he was growing so blind that he could hardly find  the way. But the Princess Putri Balan went on chewing the betel-nut, and  to herself she said,--    [Illustration: _Putri Balan began to laugh_]    \"How am I to rid myself of this bore? I cannot chew this little  betel-nut forever; there must be an end to it before long. Mr. Owl  will certainly come again to-morrow night, and then, according to my  promise, I must become his wife. I cannot marry old Goggle-Eyes. Oh  dear! What shall I do?\"    As she chewed her betel-nut the Princess Putri Balan hit upon a plan.  She would manage to cheat old Mr. Owl after all. She would never finish  the betel-nut! She took the little bit that remained,--and it was a  dangerously little bit, for the Princess had been chewing all night  long, except when she was laughing,--and reaching out from the moon she  tossed it down, down, down upon the earth. At the same time she said a  magic moon-charm: and when the bit of betel-nut reached the earth, it  became a little bird,--the same which the Malay people call the Honey  Bird, with brilliant, beautiful plumage. And the Princess Putri Balan  cried out to it from her golden house,--    \"Fly away, pretty little bright bird! Fly as far and as fast as ever you  can, and keep out of Mr. Owl's way. For it is you who must save me from  becoming his unhappy wife.\"    So the Honey Bird flew away, a brilliant streak, through the Malay  woods, and hid himself in a little nest.    When night came out stole Mr. Owl, with his spectacles in place, and up  he flew to his Princess, whom he now hoped to call his very own.    \"Good evening, my beautiful Princess!\" he cried. \"Have you finished your  betel-nut at last, and are you ready to keep your promise?\"    But the Princess Putri Balan looked down at him, pretending to be sad,  though there was a twinkle in her beautiful eye; and she said,--    \"Alas! Mr. Owl, a dreadful thing has happened. I lost my betel-nut,  before it was quite finished. It fell down, down, down, until I think it  reached the earth. And I cannot marry you, according to my promise,  until it is finished.\"    \"Then it must be found!\" cried Mr. Owl. \"I will find it. My eyes are  sharp at night and nothing escapes them. Shine kindly on me, Princess,  and I will find the betel-nut for you, and you shall yet be mine.\"    \"Go then, Mr. Owl,\" said the Princess, smiling to herself. \"Go and look  for the betel-nut which I must finish before I marry you. Search  carefully and you may find it soon.\"    Poor Mr. Owl searched carefully, but he could not find the bit of  betel-nut. Of course he could not find it, when it had changed and flown  away as a beautiful, many-colored bird! All that night he sought, till  the sun sent him blinking to his tree. And all the next night he  sought, and the next, and the next. And he kept on seeking for days and  months and years, while the Princess Putri Balan smiled down upon him  and was happy at heart because of her clever scheme.    Old Mr. Owl never found out the trick, nor suspected the innocent little  Honey Bird, whom indeed he scarcely ever saw, because it was a  sunset-sleeping bird, while he was a wistful, lonely, sad night-prowler.  Up and down, up and down the world he goes, still looking for the  betel-nut of the Princess Putri Balan, which he will never find. And as  he flies in the moonlight he glances ever longingly at the beautiful  lady in the moon, and sobs \"Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!\" in grief and despair. For  after all these centuries he begins to fear that she will never be his  wife.          THE TUFTED CAP      One dark night Master Owl left his hollow tree and went prowling about  the world as usual upon his hopeless hunt for the Princess's betel-nut.  As soon as he was out of hearing a long, lean, hungry Rat crept to the  house and stole the dainties which the lonely old bachelor had stored  away for the morrow's dinner. The thief dragged them away to his own  hole and had a splendid feast with his wife and little ones. But the Owl  returned sooner than the Rat had expected, and by the crumbs which he  had dropped upon the way tracked him to the hole.    \"Come out, thief!\" cried the Owl, \"or I will surely kill you. Come out  and return to me my morrow's dinner.\" The Rat trembled with fear at  these threatening words.    \"Alas!\" he squeaked, \"I cannot do that, for already the dinner is eaten.  My wife and hungry little ones have eaten it. Pity us, for we were  starving!\"    \"Bah!\" screamed the Owl, \"I care little for that. It is for my dinner  alone that I care. Since you have eaten it you shall certainly die,\" and  he began to scratch fiercely at the mouth of the hole. The Rat trembled  more than ever. But suddenly he had an idea which made his whiskers  twitch.    \"Hold!\" he cried. \"Dear, good Master Owl, permit me to live and I will  give you something which is worth many dinners, something that  men-creatures value very highly, and which with great labor and pain I  brought away from one of their dens.\"    \"Umph!\" grumbled the Owl. \"Let us see what it is.\"    The Rat crawled timidly out of his hole with the peace-offering; and  what do you think it was? Why, a gimlet! Just a plain, ordinary,  well-sharpened gimlet for boring holes.    \"Hoo!\" cried the Owl. \"I don't think much of _that_. What is it good  for?\" Now the Rat had not the faintest idea as to what the gimlet really  was, but he had another idea instead.    \"That? Why--that--oh, _that_! That is a very valuable thing. It is able  to give you the keenest delight. I will show you how it works. But you  must do just as I say, or it will be of no use.\"    \"Hoo!\" cried the Owl. \"Continue with the directions.\"    \"Well, first you must stick the thing point upwards in the ground at the  foot of this tree.\"    \"Very good,\" said the Owl, doing as was suggested, and waiting  expectantly for the next move.    \"Now you must mount to the top of the tree and slide down the trunk,\"  said the Rat solemnly. Old Master Owl was certainly very far from wise  that night, for he obeyed the Rat's word without a suspicion. He flew to  the top of the tree, and then, sitting back and giving a warning cry of  \"Hoo-hoo!\" coasted down the trunk with the speed of lightning. But  midway down he struck a knot in the tree and rolled heels over head. And  when he reached the ground of course he landed fast upon the sharp point  of the gimlet, just as the Rat had planned.    With bloody head, and hooting with pain, the Owl started off in pursuit  of the Rat, resolved this time to kill him without fail. The Rat was  nimble, and his fear added to his speed, but at last the Owl caught him.  Ruffled and ferocious, the great bird was about to tear him in pieces,  when the Rat once more begged his life.    \"It was only a joke,\" he cried. \"Only a silly joke. Spare me this once,  dear Master Owl, and I will give you something that you really need.  Look at your bleeding head. You cannot go about the world with that  exposed. Spare my life, and I will give you a lovely cap of tufted  feathers to hide the bite of the wicked sharp-thing-made-by-man. Pray,  let me go, dear Master Owl.\"    The Owl considered for a moment, and then decided to accept the bargain.  For he thought of Putri Balan, the Princess of the Moon, and knew that  he should lose his last chance to win her if she happened to see him  with this ridiculous wound in his head.    So the Rat gave him a nice cap of tufted feathers, which he wears to  this day; and the Owl let the thief go free. But after that there was a  coolness between them, as you may well imagine.
