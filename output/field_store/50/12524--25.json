Now this  individual variability exists among all creatures whatever, which we can  closely observe, even when the two parents are very much alike and have  been matched in order to preserve some special breed. The same thing  occurs in the vegetable kingdom. All plants raised from seed differ more  or less from each other. In every bed of flowers or of vegetables we  shall find, if we look closely, that there are countless small  differences, in the size, in the mode of growth, in the shape or colour  of the leaves, in the form, colour, or markings of the flowers, or in  the size, form, colour, or flavour of the fruit. These differences are  usually small, but are yet easily seen, and in their extremes are very  considerable; and they have this important quality, that they have a  tendency to be reproduced, and thus by careful breeding any particular  variation or group of variations can be increased to an enormous  extent--apparently to any extent not incompatible with the life, growth,  and reproduction of the plant or animal.    The way this is done is by artificial selection, and it is very  important to understand this process and its results. Suppose we have a  plant with a small edible seed, and we want to increase the size of that  seed. We grow as large a quantity of it as possible, and when the crop  is ripe we carefully choose a few of the very largest seeds, or we may  by means of a sieve sort out a quantity of the largest seeds. Next year  we sow only these large seeds, taking care to give them suitable soil  and manure, and the result is found to be that the _average_ size of the  seeds is larger than in the first crop, and that the largest seeds are  now somewhat larger and more numerous. Again sowing these, we obtain a  further slight increase of size, and in a very few years we obtain a  greatly improved race, which will always produce larger seeds than the  unimproved race, even if cultivated without any special care. In this  way all our fine sorts of vegetables, fruits, and flowers have been  obtained, all our choice breeds of cattle or of poultry, our wonderful  race-horses, and our endless varieties of dogs. It is a very common but  mistaken idea that this improvement is due to crossing and feeding in  the case of animals, and to improved cultivation in the case of plants.  Crossing is occasionally used in order to obtain a combination of  qualities found in two distinct breeds, and also because it is found to  increase the constitutional vigour; but every breed possessing any  exceptional quality is the result of the selection of variations  occurring year after year and accumulated in the manner just described.  Purity of breed, with repeated selection of the best varieties of that  breed, is the foundation of all improvement in our domestic animals and  cultivated plants.      _Proofs of the Generality of Variation._    Another very common error is, that variation is the exception, and  rather a rare exception, and that it occurs only in one direction at a  time--that is, that only one or two of the numerous possible modes of  variation occur at the same time. The experience of breeders and  cultivators, however, proves that variation is the rule instead of the  exception, and that it occurs, more or less, in almost every direction.  This is shown by the fact that different species of plants and animals  have required different _kinds_ of modification to adapt them to our  use, and we have never failed to meet with variation _in that particular  direction_, so as to enable us to accumulate it and so to produce  ultimately a large amount of change in the required direction. Our  gardens furnish us with numberless examples of this property of plants.  In the cabbage and lettuce we have found variation in the size and mode  of growth of the leaf, enabling us to produce by selection the almost  innumerable varieties, some with solid heads of foliage quite unlike any  plant in a state of nature, others with curiously wrinkled leaves like  the savoy, others of a deep purple colour used for pickling. From the  very same species as the cabbage (Brassica oleracea) have arisen the  broccoli and cauliflower, in which the leaves have undergone little  alteration, while the branching heads of flowers grow into a compact  mass forming one of our most delicate vegetables. The brussels sprouts  are another form of the same plant, in which the whole mode of growth  has been altered, numerous little heads of leaves being produced on the  stem. In other varieties the ribs of the leaves are thickened so as to  become themselves a culinary vegetable; while, in the Kohlrabi, the stem  grows into a turnip-like mass just above ground. Now all these  extraordinarily distinct plants come from one original species which  still grows wild on our coasts; and it must have varied in all these  directions, otherwise variations could not have been accumulated to the  extent we now see them. The flowers and seeds of all these plants have  remained nearly stationary, because no attempt has been made to  accumulate the slight variations that no doubt occur in them.    If now we turn to another set of plants, the turnips, radishes, carrots,  and potatoes, we find that the roots or underground tubers have been  wonderfully enlarged and improved, and also altered in shape and colour,  while the stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits have remained almost  unchanged. In the various kinds of peas and beans it is the pod or fruit  and the seed that has been subjected to selection, and therefore greatly  modified; and it is here very important to notice that while all these  plants have undergone cultivation in a great variety of soils and  climates, with different manures and under different systems, yet the  flowers have remained but little altered, those of the broad bean, the  scarlet-runner, and the garden-pea, being nearly the same in all the  varieties. This shows us how little change is produced by mere  cultivation, or even by variety of soil and climate, if there is no  _selection_ to preserve and accumulate the small variations that are  continually occurring. When, however, a great amount of modification has  been effected in one country, change to another country produces a  decided effect. Thus it has been found that some of the numerous  varieties of maize produced and cultivated in the United States change  considerably, not only in their size and colour, but even in the shape  of the seed when grown for a few successive years in Germany.[31] In all  our cultivated fruit trees the fruits vary immensely in shape, size,  colour, flavour, time of ripening, and other qualities, while the leaves  and flowers usually differ so little that they are hardly  distinguishable except to a very close observer.      _Variations of Apples and of Melons._    The most remarkable varieties are afforded by the apple and the melon,  and some account of these will be given as illustrating the effects of  slight variations accumulated by selection. All our apples are known to  have descended from the common crab of our hedges (Pyrus malus), and  from this at least a thousand distinct varieties have been produced.  These differ greatly in the size and form of the fruit, in its colour,  and in the texture of the skin. They further differ in the time of  ripening, in their flavour, and in their keeping properties; but apple  trees also differ in many other ways. The foliage of the different  varieties can often be distinguished by peculiarities of form and  colour, and it varies considerably in the time of its appearance; in  some hardly a leaf appears till the tree is in full bloom, while others  produce their leaves so early as almost to hide the flowers. The flowers  differ in size and colour, and in one case in structure also, that of  the St. Valery apple having a double calyx with ten divisions, and  fourteen styles with oblique stigmas, but without stamens or corolla.  The flowers, therefore, have to be fertilised with the pollen from other  varieties in order to produce fruit. The pips or seeds differ also in  shape, size, and colour; some varieties are liable to canker more than  others, while the Winter Majetin and one or two others have the strange  constitutional peculiarity of never being attacked by the mealy bug even  when all the other trees in the same orchard are infested with it.    All the cucumbers and gourds vary immensely, but the melon (Cucumis  melo) exceeds them all. A French botanist, M. Naudin, devoted six years  to their study. He found that previous botanists had described thirty  distinct species, as they thought, which were really only varieties of  melons. They differ chiefly in their fruits, but also very much in  foliage and mode of growth. Some melons are only as large as small  plums, others weigh as much as sixty-six pounds. One variety has a  scarlet fruit. Another is not more than an inch in diameter, but  sometimes more than a yard in length, twisting about in all directions  like a serpent. Some melons are exactly like cucumbers; and an Algerian  variety, when ripe, cracks and falls to pieces, just as occurs in a  wild gourd (C. momordica).[32]      _Variations of Flowers._    Turning to flowers, we find that in the same genus as our currant and  gooseberry, which we have cultivated for their fruits, there are some  ornamental species, as the Ribes sanguinea, and in these the flowers  have been selected so as to produce deep red, pink, or white varieties.  When any particular flower becomes fashionable and is grown in large  quantities, variations are always met with sufficient to produce great  varieties of tint or marking, as shown by our roses, auriculas, and  geraniums."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#19)"],[1,"music was invented in Europe).    Given a sequence of a few sounds, the brain will try to predict the occurence  of the next sounds. Sometimes the prediction is correct sometimes not. If the  prediction is good too often, the impression is described in words like:  boring, monotonous or upsetting. When the prediction is not correct(there is a  large discrepancy between the prediction and IR), the sounds are uncorellated.  If we have an acceptable difference (the sounds are considered corellated  after modifying slightly the algorithm of generation of the sequence), then we  can associate this to music.    The corellation is associated with the capacity of generation of a sequence  based on an algorithm.    This automatic activity of continuous modifying the generation algorithm can  produce a positive state of mind, which can be called pleasure. This means  that the predictions are correct constantly, with high probability, and that  the ones, which are not correct, are accepted, after an acceptable change of  the algorithm. This activity is called currently music.    The corellation can be supported implicitly, as it happens in classical music  or can be supported explicitly (e. g. by rhythm of drums).    If we accept the hypothesis of the existence of a facility associated with  image models (a hardware facility) to build an algorithm of generation of  corellated information, then we could try to see if this facilty evolved in  time or not.    Thus, in spite of the fact that the capacity of the brain to operate with  image models diminishes relatively in time, the development of the capacity to  operate with symbolic models generated new abilities of operation with image  models. In consequence, music evolves based on two somewhat contrary  tendencies. The capacity to build and operate image models decreases due to  the increase of the capacity to operate symbolic model, and, on the other  hand, the symbolic models support the image models in the domain of music.    The symbolic models, which were developed especially in Europe, determined the  high level of complexity of the music. The European polyphonic music is one of  the results of the \"marriage\" between image and symbolic models in music.  Other civilisations, which did not have an extensive development based on  symbolic models, have created in milleniums of evolution only a simple music.    Let's see in the following some elements of the evolution of music in Europe.  The symbolic 'recipes' appeared in music composition in the time of J.S. Bach.  The maximum complexity of the music was attained during the times of W.A.  Mozart. In that period, the music had several simultaneous musical lines,  which, according to possibilities, were followed by those who were able to do  it. E.g. in the \"Great Messa\", KV 427 by Mozart, several musical planes exist,  which have to be followed simultaneously. Even nowadays, just the recording of  this work poses technical problems. This musical work is one of the peak  complexity constructions in music.    Approximately after year 1800, due to the increased capacity to operate with  symbolic models, the capacity to operate image models decreased. Music  continued to be polyphonic, but became simpler, with a single melodic line (L.  van Beethoven, contemporary with Mozart).    This simplified music was called romantic music, and was a form of  fundamentalism. The majority of the population lost their capacity to operate  very complex image models, and so, such a simplified music was generated.    This tendency continued with the increase of the limits of predictions  acceptability, due the increase of the capability of construction and  operation with symbolic models. E.g. the music composed by Igor Stravinsky.  When his music appeared, it was rejected due to surpassing the limits of  acceptability. But, in a short time, other musicians and people accepted his  music, as a consequence of the increase of the acceptability limits.    It is reminded that the increase of the acceptability limits is due to the  increase of the capacity to build generation algorithms. An assumption is that  these algorithms are supported by symbolic models.    Nowadays, music is so \"advanced\" that it contains just a rudimentary rhythm,  and an endless text (hip-hop or rap music e.g.).    The children of our times have a reduced capacity to understand music. Around  the year 1800, some 4 years old children were able to play the piano or  violin, or even to compose music. In our days, this is not met anymore. But,  some children are able to build and operate computer-based symbolic models.    As it is shown also, in some other parts of the book, there is a new form of  fundamentalism nowadays: the rejection of the symbolic models by a fraction of  the population. That is, some people return to harmony (there are many who  prefer Mozart e.g.). The present music is balancing between symbolic-type  music (hip-hop or rap e.g.) and harmonic music. This tendency will continue  for a long time, because it is hard to believe that music will disappear (the  brain is based on image models forever), but returning to the year 1800 type  harmony is not possible anymore.    Music is defined as a special story-type model associated with sounds. This  story-type model has elements generated by an algorithm generator.    The generating algorithm is able to build in a dynamically way the elements  which will be recorded by this special type story-type model. Based on the  algorithm, the model is able to predict the future sounds based on the sounds  already received.    Sometimes the algorithm generator is able to make a correct prediction of the  sound which comes (a hit), sometimes not (a miss). If the prediction fails,  then the generator will modify the algorithm and continue to predict what  follows. When the number of misses is low, this could produce pleasure to the  brain. When the number of misses is zero, there is no pleasure (e.g. a boring  music). When the number of hits is zero, there is no music (no correlation  between the sounds).    As this special story-type model is an image-model, its power is decreasing as  the brain is evolving to symbolic models. On the other hand, it seems that the  symbolic models support the algorithm generator. That is, there are two  tendencies that act in contrary directions. One tendency is to make a  simplified music, based mainly on symbolic models (texts) in the frame of a  rudimentary rhythm (e.g. drums), as hip-hop and rap music and on the other  hand, to make music based on complex algorithms (to enlarge the limits of  acceptability). The present music is evolving between these two large limits.    The main tendencies of the present music are:    - The evolution based on symbolic models. This tendency increases the limits  of acceptability of what are and what are not correlated sounds.    - The rejection of the symbolic models by a fraction of the population, i.e.  people want harmonic music.    - The return to harmony is possible only partially because many abilities  associated with the main story-type model are lost, due to the general  tendency of conceptualization of the image models. That is, the algorithm  generator is better and better, but it acts on recorded data, which are a  simplified copy of the external reality.    Let's see what is the situation with other arts. Almost all classical arts are  in decline. Painting and sculpture are based on pure image models. The general  tendency is to make concept models, and so people are not able anymore to  perceive fine details. This tendency is very easily seen in contemporary arts.  The tendency in visual arts is to make works based on symbolic models, and to  increase the complexity. Some arts as poetry, painting and sculpture are on  the way to disappearance as stand-alone arts. Theatre, because it is based on  symbolic models, is surviving, as it tries to keep the contact with the  tendencies of the society. Music is still in a good shape, as we already saw.  The main ascending art is cinematography.    ETA 8: Cinematography    Let's make a symbolic model to understand the subject as follows:    - The importance of the symbolic models (thinking e.g.) increases    - A big fraction of the population has difficulties to evolve based on  symbolic models (fundamentalism)    - Fundamentalism means to return to image models    - This return is possible only partially.      Because returning to image models affects an important fraction of the  population, why is it not seen in painting and sculpture? The explanation is  that the brain has lost a lot of its capacity to make and operate pure image  models. The brain returns to image models, but it stops at the level of  concept models.    Cinematography is one of the responses suitable to this situation. Thus, there  are cartoons, based on concept image models. They are strongly attached to  symbolic models. There are cartoons, in which symbolic models are more  important than the concept image models.    Today's successful movies are image models, which try to develop and extend  some of the incipient image models preexisting in the mind of the viewer.    We remind here that people have the tendency to expand their structure of  models outside their mind. When the models can't be expanded to the external  reality, there is the tendency to expand these models into a virtual reality.  This is speculated by cinematography, depending on the profile of image models  in different cultural zones.    From this point of view, movies can be very dangerous. They make these  developments based on what people would like to happen and on the other hand,  they favorize the fundamental tendencies of various social groups.    However, as they are attached to symbolic models, some movies are used to  develop symbolic models and fight fundamentalist tendencies and as such, have  a positive impact on society.    A huge"]]]
