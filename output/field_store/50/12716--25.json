[317-[+]] \"Y con isopo en el mano de un palo corto muy labrado, y por  barbas o pelos del isopo ciertas colas de unas culebras que son como  caxcavales.\"    [318-*] Brinton (1893, p. 25) notes that the equivalent of _Kan_ in the  Nahuatl of Miztitlan is _xilotl_ which means ear of corn. This seems to  show the correctness of the usual identification of the _Kan_ sign as  meaning maize or bread (_pan_).    [318-[+]] \"Y les ofrecian dos pellas de una leche o resina de un arbol  que llaman _kik_, para quemar y ciertas iguanas y pan y una mitra y un  manojo de flores y una piedra preciosa de las suyas.\"    [319-*] \"Y pintaban un largarto que significaba el Diluvio--y la tierra  e sobre este largarto hazian un gran monton de lena y ponianle fuego.\"    [323-*] See in this connection Seler, 1904.    [327-*] \"Y ofrecerle cabecas de pavos y pan y bevidas de maiz.\"    [327-[+]] (Kan year) \"Sahumavan la imagen, degollavan una gallina y se  la presentavan o offrecian ... y assi le hazian muchas offrendas de  comidas y bevidas de carne y pescado, y estas offrendas repartian a los  estrangeros que alli se hallavan.\"    (Muluc year) \"Y despues degollavanle la gallina como al passado.\"    (Ix year) \"Y degollavan la gallina ... a la estatua de _Kac-u-Uayeyab_  ofrescian una cabeca de un pavo, y empanados de codornices y otras  coasa[TN-11] y su bevida.\"    (Cauac year) \"Coma solian y degollavanle la gallina ... un hombre muerto  y en cima un paxaro cenicero llamad _kuch_, en senal de mortandad  grande, ca por muy mal ano tenian este.\"    [330-*] Foerstemann identifies this bird as a black eagle.    [333-*] \"Este ano en que la letra era _Cauac_ y reynava el  _Bacab-Hozanek_ tenian, allende de la pronosticada mortandad, por ruyn,  por que dezian les avian los muchos soles de matar los maizales, y comer  las muchas hormigas lo que sembrassen y los paxaros, y porque esto no  seria en todas partes avria en algunos comida, la qual avrian con gran  trabajo.\"    [338-*] Brinton (1895, p. 74), according to our interpretation, makes a  mistake when he considers the crested falcon as the Moan, \"in Maya  _muan_ or _muyan_.\" He adds, \"Some writers have thought the moan bird  was a mythical animal but Dr. C. H. Berendt found the name still applied  to the falcon. In the form _muyan_, it is akin in sound to _muyal_,  cloud, _muan_, cloudy, which may account for its adoption as a symbol of  the rains, etc.\"    [341-*] \"Crian paxaros para su recreacion y para las plumas para hazer  sus ropas galanas.\"    [349-*] _Relacion hecha por el Licenciado Palacio al Rey. D. Felipe II_  (1866, p. 31). \"Lo que hacian en los sacrificios de la pesca y caza, era  que tomaban un venado vivo y llevabanlo al patio del cu e iglesia que  tenian fuera del pueblo y alli lo ahogaban y lo desollaban y le salaban  toda la sangre en una olla, y el higado y bofes y buches los hacian  pedazos muy pequenos y apartaban el corazon, cabeza y pies, y mandaban  cocer el venado por si, la sangre for[TN-12] si, y mientras esto se  cocia, hacian su baile. Tomaban el Papa y sabio la cabeza del venado por  las orejas, y los cuatro sacerdotes los cuatro pies, y el mayordomo  llevaba un brasero, do se quemaba el corazon con uli y copa, e incensaban  al idolo que tenian puesto y senalado para la caza y pesca. Acabado el  mitote, ofrecian la cabeza y pies al idolo y chamuscabanla, y despues de  chamuscada, la llevaban a casa del Papa y se la comia y el venado y su  sangre comian los demas sacerdotes delante del idolo; a los pescados les  sacaban las tripas y los quemaban ante el dicho idolo. Lo propio era con  los demas animales.\"    _Relacion de Cotuta y Tibolon_ (1898, p. 105). \"Un dios que dezian que  eran benados en matando un yndio un benado benia luego a su dios y con  el coracon le untaba la cara de sangre y sino mataba algo aquel dia  ybase a su casa aquel yndio le quebraba y dabale de cozes diziendo que  no era buen dios.\"    Cogolludo (1688, Book I, Chap. VII, p. 43) \"Correan tan poco los  venados, y tan sin espantarse de la gente, que los soldados de a cavallo  del exercito los alcancavan, y alanceavan, muy a su placer, y de esta  suerte mataron muchos de ellos, con que comieron algunos dias despues  ... Que en que consistia aquella novedad, de aver tanta maquina de  venados, y estar tan mansos? Les dieron por respuesta; Que en aquellos  Pueblos los tenian por sus Dioses a los venador; porque su Idolo Mayor  se les avia aparecido en aquella figura.\"    [350-*] \"Y con su devocion invocavan los cacadores a los dioses de la  caca, ... sacava cada uno una flecha y una calabera de venado, las  quales los _chaces_ untavan con el betun azul; y untados, vailavan con  ellas en las manos unos.\"    [350-[+]] In the _Muluc_ years, he states \"davan al sacredote una pierna  de venado\" and also in the same month, \"Ofrecian a la imagen pan hecho  como yemas de uevos y otros como coracones de venados, y otro hecho con  su pimienta desleida.\"    [351-*] Foerstemann (1902, p. 20) identifies this animal as a rabbit!    [351-[+]] Foerstemann identifies this animal as a dog.    [352-*] This animal has been identified by Stempell as an agouti  notwithstanding the hoofs and tusks.    [352-[+]] Foerstemann (1906, p. 228) suggests that this animal is a bear.    [353-*] Attention is called to the curious half-human, half-animal  figure in Tro-Cortesianus 2a which may suggest the figures in Dresden  44a, 45a and which are here identified as peccaries. Both are descending  from the band of constellation signs and the heads of each are not  greatly dissimilar.    [354-*] Foerstemann (1906, p. 229) suggests that fig. 8 is a walrus!    [358-*] Seler (1904) gives an interesting explanation of the reason why  the puma and the other corresponding figures are shown hit with a spear.    [359-*] _Relacion de la Ciudad de Merida_ (1898, p. 63): \"Ay perros  naturales dela tierra que no tienen pelo ninguno, y no ladran, que  tienen los dientes ralos e agudos, las orejas pequenas, tiesas y  levantadas--a estos engordan los yndios para comer y los tienen por gran  rregalo--estos se juntan con los perros de espana y enjendran y los  mestizos que dellos proceden ladran y tienen pelo y tambien los comen  los yndios cano alos demas, y tambien los yndios tienen otra suerte de  perros que tienen pelo pero tan poco ladran y son del mesmo tamano que  los demas.\"    [359-[+]] Brinton (1895, p. 72) regards these spots as representing  stars.    [361-*] \"Y que le sacrificassen un perro o un hombre ... porque hazian  en el patio del templo un gran monton de piedras y ponian al hombre o  perro que avian de sacrificiar en alguna cosa mas alta que el.\"    [361-[+]] \"Avian de ofrescerle perros hechos de barro con pan en las  espaldas, y avian de vailar con ellos en las manos las viejas y  sacrificarle un perrito que tuviesse las espaldas negras y fuesse  virgen.\"    [361-[++]] These might quite as well be rabbits as dogs.    [361-Sec.] \"De los Indios de Cozumel dize, que aun en su tiempo eran  grandes Idolatras, y usaban un bayle de su gentilidad, en el qual  flechaban un perro [^q] auian de sacrificar.\"    [362-*] \"Donde sacrificavan un perro, manchado por la color del cacao  ... y ofrecianles yguanas de las azules y ciertas plumas de un paxaro.\"          BIBLIOGRAPHY.

What is the offence of a lamb that we should rear it, and tend it, and  lull it into security, for the express purpose of killing it?  Its  offence is the misfortune of being something which society wants to eat,  and which cannot defend itself.  This is ample.  Who shall limit the  right of society except society itself?  And what consideration for the  individual is tolerable unless society be the gainer thereby?  Wherefore  should a man be so richly rewarded for having been son to a millionaire,  were it not clearly provable that the common welfare is thus better  furthered?  We cannot seriously detract from a man's merit in having been  the son of a rich father without imperilling our own tenure of things  which we do not wish to jeopardise; if this were otherwise we should not  let him keep his money for a single hour; we would have it ourselves at  once.  For property is robbery, but then, we are all robbers or would-be  robbers together, and have found it essential to organise our thieving,  as we have found it necessary to organise our lust and our revenge.  Property, marriage, the law; as the bed to the river, so rule and  convention to the instinct; and woe to him who tampers with the banks  while the flood is flowing.    But to return.  Even in England a man on board a ship with yellow fever  is held responsible for his mischance, no matter what his being kept in  quarantine may cost him.  He may catch the fever and die; we cannot help  it; he must take his chance as other people do; but surely it would be  desperate unkindness to add contumely to our self-protection, unless,  indeed, we believe that contumely is one of our best means of  self-protection.  Again, take the case of maniacs.  We say that they are  irresponsible for their actions, but we take good care, or ought to take  good care, that they shall answer to us for their insanity, and we  imprison them in what we call an asylum (that modern sanctuary!) if we do  not like their answers.  This is a strange kind of irresponsibility.  What  we ought to say is that we can afford to be satisfied with a less  satisfactory answer from a lunatic than from one who is not mad, because  lunacy is less infectious than crime.    We kill a serpent if we go in danger by it, simply for being such and  such a serpent in such and such a place; but we never say that the  serpent has only itself to blame for not having been a harmless creature.  Its crime is that of being the thing which it is: but this is a capital  offence, and we are right in killing it out of the way, unless we think  it more danger to do so than to let it escape; nevertheless we pity the  creature, even though we kill it.    But in the case of him whose trial I have described above, it was  impossible that any one in the court should not have known that it was  but by an accident of birth and circumstances that he was not himself  also in a consumption; and yet none thought that it disgraced them to  hear the judge give vent to the most cruel truisms about him.  The judge  himself was a kind and thoughtful person.  He was a man of magnificent  and benign presence.  He was evidently of an iron constitution, and his  face wore an expression of the maturest wisdom and experience; yet for  all this, old and learned as he was, he could not see things which one  would have thought would have been apparent even to a child.  He could  not emancipate himself from, nay, it did not even occur to him to feel,  the bondage of the ideas in which he had been born and bred.    So was it also with the jury and bystanders; and--most wonderful of  all--so was it even with the prisoner.  Throughout he seemed fully  impressed with the notion that he was being dealt with justly: he saw  nothing wanton in his being told by the judge that he was to be punished,  not so much as a necessary protection to society (although this was not  entirely lost sight of), as because he had not been better born and bred  than he was.  But this led me to hope that he suffered less than he would  have done if he had seen the matter in the same light that I did.  And,  after all, justice is relative.    I may here mention that only a few years before my arrival in the  country, the treatment of all convicted invalids had been much more  barbarous than now, for no physical remedy was provided, and prisoners  were put to the severest labour in all sorts of weather, so that most of  them soon succumbed to the extreme hardships which they suffered; this  was supposed to be beneficial in some ways, inasmuch as it put the  country to less expense for the maintenance of its criminal class; but  the growth of luxury had induced a relaxation of the old severity, and a  sensitive age would no longer tolerate what appeared to be an excess of  rigour, even towards the most guilty; moreover, it was found that juries  were less willing to convict, and justice was often cheated because there  was no alternative between virtually condemning a man to death and  letting him go free; it was also held that the country paid in  recommittals for its over-severity; for those who had been imprisoned  even for trifling ailments were often permanently disabled by their  imprisonment; and when a man had been once convicted, it was probable  that he would seldom afterwards be off the hands of the country.    These evils had long been apparent and recognised; yet people were too  indolent, and too indifferent to suffering not their own, to bestir  themselves about putting an end to them, until at last a benevolent  reformer devoted his whole life to effecting the necessary changes.  He  divided all illnesses into three classes--those affecting the head, the  trunk, and the lower limbs--and obtained an enactment that all diseases  of the head, whether internal or external, should be treated with  laudanum, those of the body with castor-oil, and those of the lower limbs  with an embrocation of strong sulphuric acid and water.    It may be said that the classification was not sufficiently careful, and  that the remedies were ill chosen; but it is a hard thing to initiate any  reform, and it was necessary to familiarise the public mind with the  principle, by inserting the thin end of the wedge first: it is not,  therefore, to be wondered at that among so practical a people there  should still be some room for improvement.  The mass of the nation are  well pleased with existing arrangements, and believe that their treatment  of criminals leaves little or nothing to be desired; but there is an  energetic minority who hold what are considered to be extreme opinions,  and who are not at all disposed to rest contented until the principle  lately admitted has been carried further.    I was at some pains to discover the opinions of these men, and their  reasons for entertaining them.  They are held in great odium by the  generality of the public, and are considered as subverters of all  morality whatever.  The malcontents, on the other hand, assert that  illness is the inevitable result of certain antecedent causes, which, in  the great majority of cases, were beyond the control of the individual,  and that therefore a man is only guilty for being in a consumption in the  same way as rotten fruit is guilty for having gone rotten.  True, the  fruit must be thrown on one side as unfit for man's use, and the man in a  consumption must be put in prison for the protection of his  fellow-citizens; but these radicals would not punish him further than by  loss of liberty and a strict surveillance.  So long as he was prevented  from injuring society, they would allow him to make himself useful by  supplying whatever of society's wants he could supply.  If he succeeded  in thus earning money, they would have him made as comfortable in prison  as possible, and would in no way interfere with his liberty more than was  necessary to prevent him from escaping, or from becoming more severely  indisposed within the prison walls; but they would deduct from his  earnings the expenses of his board, lodging, surveillance, and half those  of his conviction.  If he was too ill to do anything for his support in  prison, they would allow him nothing but bread and water, and very little  of that.    They say that society is foolish in refusing to allow itself to be  benefited by a man merely because he has done it harm hitherto, and that  objection to the labour of the diseased classes is only protection in  another form.  It is an attempt to raise the natural price of a commodity  by saying that such and such persons, who are able and willing to produce  it, shall not do so, whereby every one has to pay more for it.    Besides, so long as a man has not been actually killed he is our fellow-  creature, though perhaps a very unpleasant one.  It is in a great degree  the doing of others that he is what he is, or in other words, the society  which now condemns him is partly answerable concerning him.  They say  that there is no fear of any increase of disease under these  circumstances; for the loss of liberty, the surveillance, the  considerable and compulsory deduction from the prisoner's earnings, the  very sparing use of stimulants (of which they would allow but little to  any, and none to those who did not earn them), the enforced celibacy, and  above all, the loss of reputation among friends, are in their opinion as  ample safeguards to society against a general neglect of health as those  now resorted to.  A man, therefore, (so they say) should carry his  profession or trade into prison with him if possible; if not, he must  earn his living by the nearest thing to it that he can; but if he be a  gentleman born and bred to no profession, he must pick oakum, or write  art criticisms for a newspaper.    These people say further, that the greater part of the illness which  exists in their country "]]]
