I'm  a leader among my young companions at the time; in fact, I allers is.  An' I'm proud to say that my soopremacy that a-way is doo to the  dom'nant character of my intellects. I'm ever bright an' sparklin' as a  child, an' I recalls how my aptitoode for learnin' promotes me to be  regyarded as the smartest lad in my set. If thar's visitors to the  school, or if the selectman invades that academy to sort o' size us up,  the teacher allers plays me on 'em. I'd go to the front for the outfit.  Which I'm wont on sech harrowin' o'casions to recite a ode--the  teacher's done wrote it himse'f--an' which is entitled _Napoleon's Mad  Career_. Thar's twenty-four stanzas to it; an' while these interlopin'  selectmen sets thar lookin' owley an' sagacious, I'd wallop loose with  the twenty-four verses, stampin' up and down, an' accompanyin' said  recitations with sech a multitood of reckless gestures, it comes plenty  clost to backin' everybody plumb outen the room. Yere's the first verse:        I'd drink an' sw'ar an' r'ar an' t'ar        An' fall down in the mud,      While the y'earth for forty miles about        Is kivered with my blood.    \"'You-all can see from that speciment that our school-master ain't  simply flirtin' with the muses when he originates that epic; no, sir, he  means business; an' whenever I throws it into the selectmen, I does it  jestice. The trustees used to silently line out for home when I  finishes, an' never a yeep. It stuns 'em; it shore fills 'em to the  brim!    \"'As I gazes r'arward,' goes on the Colonel, as by one rapt impulse he  uplifts both his eyes an' his nosepaint, 'as I gazes r'arward, I says,  on them sun-filled days, an' speshul if ever I gets betrayed into  talkin' about 'em, I can hardly t'ar myse'f from the subject. I explains  yeretofore, that not only by inclination but by birth, I'm a  shore-enough 'ristocrat. This captaincy of local fashion I assoomes at a  tender age. I wears the record as the first child to don shoes  throughout the entire summer in that neighborhood; an' many a time an'  oft does my yoothful but envy-eaten compeers lambaste me for the  insultin' innovation. But I sticks to my moccasins; an' to-day shoes in  the Bloo Grass is almost as yooniversal as the licker habit.    \"'Thar dawns a hour, however, when my p'sition in the van of Kaintucky  _ton_ comes within a ace of bein' ser'ously shook. It's on my way to  school one dewy mornin' when I gets involved all inadvertent in a  onhappy rupture with a polecat. I never does know how the  misonderstandin' starts. After all, the seeds of said dispoote is by no  means important; it's enough to say that polecat finally has me  thoroughly convinced.    \"'Followin' the difference an' my defeat, I'm witless enough to keep  goin' on to school, whereas I should have returned homeward an' cast  myse'f upon my parents as a sacred trust. Of course, when I'm in school  I don't go impartin' my troubles to the other chil'en; I emyoolates the  heroism of the Spartan boy who stands to be eat by a fox, an' keeps 'em  to myself. But the views of my late enemy is not to be smothered; they  appeals to my young companions; who tharupon puts up a most onneedful  riot of coughin's an' sneezin's. But nobody knows me as the party who's  so pungent.    \"'It's a tryin' moment. I can see that, once I'm located, I'm goin' to  be as onpop'lar as a b'ar in a hawg pen; I'll come tumblin' from my  pinnacle in that proud commoonity as the glass of fashion an' the mold  of form. You can go your bottom _peso_, the thought causes me to feel  plenty perturbed.    \"'At this peril I has a inspiration; as good, too, as I ever entertains  without the aid of rum. I determines to cast the opprobrium on some  other boy an' send the hunt of gen'ral indignation sweepin' along his  trail.    \"'Thar's a innocent infant who's a stoodent at this temple of childish  learnin' an' his name is Riley Bark. This Riley is one of them giant  children who's only twelve an' weighs three hundred pounds. An' in  proportions as Riley is a son of Anak, physical, he's dwarfed mental; he  ain't half as well upholstered with brains as a shepherd dog. That's  right; Riley's intellects, is like a fly in a saucer of syrup, they  struggles 'round plumb slow. I decides to uplift Riley to the public eye  as the felon who's disturbin' that seminary's sereenity. Comin' to this  decision, I p'ints at him where he's planted four seats ahead, all  tangled up in a spellin' book, an' says in a loud whisper to a child  who's sittin' next:    \"'\"Throw him out!\"    \"'That's enough. No gent will ever realize how easy it is to direct a  people's sentiment ontil he take a whirl at the game. In two minutes by  the teacher's bull's-eye copper watch, every soul knows it's pore Riley;  an' in three, the teacher's done drug Riley out doors by the ha'r of his  head an' chased him home. Gents, I look back on that yoothful feat as a  triumph of diplomacy; it shore saved my standin' as the Beau Brummel of  the Bloo Grass.    \"'Good old days, them!' observes the Colonel mournfully, 'an' ones never  to come ag'in! My sternest studies is romances, an' the peroosals of old  tales as I tells you-all prior fills me full of moss an' mockin' birds  in equal parts. I reads deep of _Walter Scott_ an' waxes to be a sharp  on Moslems speshul. I dreams of the Siege of Acre, an' Richard the Lion  Heart; an' I simply can't sleep nights for honin' to hold a tournament  an' joust a whole lot for some fair lady's love.    \"'Once I commits the error of my career by joustin' with my brother  Jeff. This yere Jeff is settin' on the bank of the Branch fishin' for  bullpouts at the time, an' Jeff don't know I'm hoverin' near at all.  Jeff's reedic'lous fond of fishin'; which he'd sooner fish than read  _Paradise Lost_. I'm romancin' along, sim'larly bent, when I notes Jeff  perched on the bank. To my boyish imagination Jeff at once turns to be a  Paynim. I drops my bait box, couches my fishpole, an' emittin' a  impromptoo warcry, charges him. It's the work of a moment; Jeff's  onhossed an' falls into the Branch.    \"'But thar's bitterness to follow vict'ry. Jeff emerges like Diana from  the bath an' frales the wamus off me with a club. Talk of puttin' a  crimp in folks! Gents, when Jeff's wrath is assuaged I'm all on one side  like the leanin' tower of Pisa. Jeff actooally confers a skew-gee to my  spinal column.    \"'A week later my folks takes me to a doctor. That practitioner puts on  his specs an' looks me over with jealous care.    \"'\"Whatever's wrong with him, Doc?\" says my father.    \"'\"Nothin',\" says the physician, \"only your son Willyum's five inches  out o' plumb.\"    \"'Then he rigs a contraption made up of guy-ropes an' stay-laths, an' I  has to wear it; an' mebby in three or four weeks or so he's got me  warped back into the perpendic'lar.'    \"'But how about this cat hunt?' asks Dan Boggs. 'Which I don't aim to be  introosive none, but I'm camped yere through the second drink waitin'  for it, an' these procrastinations is makn' me kind o' batty.'    \"'That panther hunt is like this,' says the Colonel, turnin' to Dan. 'At  the age of seventeen, me an' eight or nine of my intimate brave comrades  founds what we-all denom'nates as the \"Chevy Chase Huntin' Club.\" Each  of us maintains a passel of odds an' ends of dogs, an' at stated  intervals we convenes on hosses, an' with these fourscore curs at our  tails goes yellin' an' skally-hootin' up an' down the countryside  allowin' we're shore a band of Nimrods.    \"'The Chevy Chasers ain't been in bein' as a institootion over long when  chance opens a gate to ser'ous work.

They allows he's about the size of a yearlin' calf; an' the way he pulls  down sech feeble people as sheep or lays desolate some he'pless henroost  don't bother him a bit. This panther spreads a horror over the county.  Dances, pra'er meetin's, an' even poker parties is broken up, an' the  social life of that region begins to bog down. Even a weddin' suffers;  the bridesmaids stayin' away lest this ferocious monster should show up  in the road an' chaw one of 'em while she's _en route_ for the scene of  trouble. That's gospel trooth! the pore deserted bride has to heel an'  handle herse'f an' never a friend to yoonite her sobs with hers doorin'  that weddin' ordeal. The old ladies present shakes their heads a heap  solemn.    \"'\"It's a worse augoory,\" says one, \"than the hoots of a score of  squinch owls.\"    \"'When this reign of terror is at its height, the local eye is rolled  appealin'ly towards us Chevy Chasers.

Repeatedly in laboratory experiments  it happens that a student loses interest in the performance and  subsequently makes little, if any, progress. One of the biggest problems  connected with habit-formation is that of maintaining interest.    A factor which prevents the formation of habits is that of exceptions.  If a stimulus, instead of going over to the appropriate response,  produces some other action, there is an interference in the formation of  the desired habit. The effect of an exception is greater than the mere  neglect of practice. The _exception opens up another path_ and tends to  make future action uncertain. Particularly is this true in the case of  moral habits. Forming moral habits is usually uphill work anyway, in  that we have instincts to overcome. Allowing exceptions to enter, in the  moral sphere, usually means a slipping back into an old way of acting,  thereby weakening much the newly-made connection.    In any kind of practice, when we become fatigued we make errors. If we  continue to practice when fatigued, we form connections which we do not  wish to make and which interfere with the desired habits.    =Economy of Practice.= The principles which we have enumerated and  illustrated are fairly general and of universal validity. There are  certain other factors which we may discuss here under the head of  economical procedure. To form a habit, we must practice. But how long  should we practice at one time? This is an experimental problem and has  been definitely solved. It has been proved by experiment that we can  practice profitably for as long a time as we can maintain a high degree  of attention, which is usually till we become fatigued. This time is not  the same for all people. It varies with age, and in the case of the same  person it varies at different times. If ordinary college students work  at habit-formation at the highest point of concentration, they get the  best return for a period of about a half hour. It depends somewhat on  the amount of concentration required for the work and the stage of  fixation of the habit, _i.e._ whether one has just begun to form the  habit or whether it is pretty well fixed. For children, the period of  successful practice is usually much less than a half hour--five, ten,  fifteen, twenty minutes, depending upon the age of the child and the  kind of work.    The best interval between periods of practice is the day, twenty-four  hours. If one practices in the morning for a half hour, one can practice  again in the afternoon with nearly as much return as he would secure the  next day, but not quite. In general, practice is better, gives more  return, if spread out. To practice one day as long as one can work at a  high point of efficiency, and then to postpone further practice till the  next day, gives one the most return for the time put in. But if one is  in a hurry to form a habit, one can afford to practice more each day  even if the returns from the practice do diminish proportionately.    This matter has been tried out on the typewriter. If one practices for  ten half hours a day with half-hour rests between, one does not get so  much return for his time as he would if he should spread it out at the  rate of one or two half-hour practices a day. But by working ten half  hours a day, one gets much more efficiency in the same number of days  than if he should practice only one or two half hours a day. This point  must not be misunderstood. We do not mean that one must not work at  anything longer than a half hour a day. We mean that if one is forming a  habit, his time counts for more in forming the habit if spread out at  the rate of a half hour or an hour a day, than it does if put in at a  faster rate. Therefore if one is in no hurry and can afford to spread  out his time, he gets the best return by so doing, and the habit is more  firmly fixed than if formed hurriedly. But if one is in a hurry, and has  the time to devote to it, he can afford to concentrate his practice up  to five hours or possibly more in a day, provided that rest intervals  are interspersed between periods of practice.    There is one time in habit-formation when concentrated practice is most  efficient. That is at the beginning. In a process as complicated as  typewriting, so little impression is made at the beginning by a short  period of practice that progress is but slight. On the first day, one  should practice about four or five times to secure the best returns, a  half hour each time.    =What the Teacher Can Do.= Now, let us see how the teacher can be of  assistance to the pupil in habit-formation. The teacher should have a  clear idea of the nature of the habit to be formed and should  demonstrate the habit to the pupil. Suppose the habit is so simple a  thing as long division. The teacher should explain each step in the  process. She should go to the blackboard and actually solve a number of  problems in long division, so that the pupils can see just how to do it.  After this the pupils should go to the board and solve a problem  themselves. The reason for this procedure is that it is most economical.  If the children are left to get the method of doing long division from a  book, they will not be able to do it readily and will make mistakes. A  teacher can explain a process better than it can be explained in a book.  By giving a full explanation and demonstration and then by requiring the  children to work a few problems while she watches for mistakes,  correcting them at once, the teacher secures economy of effort and time.  The first step is to demonstrate the habit to the pupils; the second, to  have them do the act, whatever it is, correcting their mistakes; the  third, to require the pupils to practice till they have acquired skill.  The teacher must make provision for practice.    =What Parents Can Do.= Parents can be of very great assistance to children  who are forming habits.    (1) They can cooeperate with the school, which is directing the child in  the systematic formation of a great system of habits. The teacher should  explain these habits to the parents so that they may know what the  teacher is trying to do. Quite often the home and the school are working  at cross purposes. The only way to prevent this is for them to work in  the closest cooeperation, with the fullest understanding of what is being  undertaken for the child. Parents and teachers should often meet  together and talk over the work of training the children of the  community. Parents should have not merely a general understanding of the  work of the school, but they should know the details undertaken. The  school often assigns practice work to be done at home in reading,  writing, arithmetic. Parents should always know of these assignments and  should help the children get the necessary practice. They can do this by  reminding the child of the work, by preparing a suitable place where the  work may be done, and by securing quiet for the practice. Children like  play and it is easy for them to forget their necessary work. Parents can  be of the greatest service to childhood and youth by holding the  children to their responsibilities and duties.    Few parents take any thought of whether their children are doing all  possible for their school progress. Few of those who do, make definite  plans and arrangements for the children to accomplish the necessary  practice and study. This is the parent's duty and responsibility.  Moreover, parents are likely to feel that children have no rights, and  think nothing of calling on them in the midst of their work to do some  errand. Now, children should work about the house and help their  parents, but there should be a time for this and a separate time for  study and practice on school work.    When a child sits down for serious practice on some work, his time  should be sacred and inviolable. Instead of interfering with the child,  the parents should do everything in their power to make this practice  possible and efficient. In their relations with their children perhaps  parents sin more in the matter of neglecting to plan for them than in  any other way. They plan for everything else, but they let their  children grow up, having taken no definite thought about helping them to  form their life habits and to establish these habits by practice. When a  child comes home from school, the mother should find out just what work  is to be done before the next day and should plan the child's play and  work in such a way as to include all necessary practice. If all parents  would do this, the value to the work of the school and to the life of  the child would be incalculable.    (2) Just as one of the main purposes of the teacher is to help the child  gain initiative, so it is one of the greatest of the parents' duties.  Parents must help the children to keep their purposes before them.  Children forget, even when they wish to remember. Often, they do not  want to remember. The parents' duty is to get the child to _want_ to  remember, and to help him to remember, whether he wants to or not. One  of the main differences between childhood and maturity is that the child  lives in the present, his purposes are all immediate ones. Habits always  look forward, they are for future good and use. Mature people have  learned to look forward and to plan for the future. They must,  therefore, perform this function for the children. They must look  forward and see what the child should learn to do, and then see that he  learns to do it.    (3) Parents must help children to plan their lives in general and in  detail; _i.e._ in the sense of determining the ideals and habits that  will be necessary for those lives. The parents must do this with the  help of the child. The child must not be a blind follower, but as the  child's mind becomes mature enough, the parent must explain the matter  of forming life habits, and must show the child that life is "]]]
