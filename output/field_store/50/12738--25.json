It is a huge handicap to us here  that our great men keep all their tricks for their political friends and  have none to spare for their natural enemies. There has been very little  attempt to disguise our aims in England, and Maxwell and McMahon in  Egypt have allowed their Press to report every arrival of French and  British troops, and to announce openly that we are about to attack at  Gallipoli. I have protested and reported the matter to K. but nothing in  the strategic sphere can be done now although, in the tactical sphere,  we have several deceptions ready for them.    Colonel Napier, Military Attache at Sofia, and Braithwaite came in after  these pseudo-secrets had been discussed and joined in the conversation.  I doubt whether either Fitzmaurice or Napier have solid information as  to what is in front of us, and their yarns about Balkan politics are  neither here nor there. John Bull is quite out of his depth in the  defiles of the Balkans. With just so much pull over the bulk of my  compatriots as has been given me by my having spent a little time with  their Armies, I may say that the Balkan nations loathe and mistrust one  another to so great a degree that it is sheer waste of time to think of  roping them all in on our side, as Fitzmaurice and Napier seem to  propose. We may get Greece to join us, and Russia may get Roumania to  join her--_if we win here_--but then we make an enemy of Bulgaria, and  _vice versa_. If they will unearth my 1909 report at the War Office they  will see that, at that time, one Bulgarian Battalion of Infantry was  worth two Battalions of Roumanian Infantry--which may be a help to them  in making their choice. The Balkan problem is so intricate that it must  be simply handled. The simple thing is to pay your money and pick the  best card, knowing you can't have a full hand. So let us have no more  beating about the bush and may we be inspired to make use of the big  boom this Expedition has given to Great Britain in the Balkans to pick  out a partner straightway.    Birdie came later and we took stock together of ways and means. We see  eye to eye now on every point. Just before lunch we heard the transport  _Manitou_ had been attacked by a Turkish torpedo boat from Smyrna. The  first wireless came in saying the enemy had made a bad shot and only a  few men had been drowned lowering the boats. Admiral Rosy Wemyss and  Hope, the Flag-Captain, of the Q.E. were my guests and naturally they  were greatly perturbed. Late in the evening we heard that the Turkish  T.B. had been chased by our destroyers and had run ashore on a Greek  Island where she was destroyed (international laws notwithstanding) by  our landing parties.    At 7.30 p.m. Hunter-Weston came along and I had the best part of an hour  with him.    _17th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Hunter-Weston came over  early to finish off business left undone last night. Admiral Wemyss also  took part in our discussions over the landing. Picture puzzles are  child's play compared with this game of working an unheard of number of  craft to and fro, in and out, of little bits of beaches. At mid-day the  _Manitou_ steamed into harbour and Colonel Peel, Commander of the  troops, came on board and reported fully to me about the attack by the  Turkish torpedo boat. The Turks seem to have behaved quite decently  giving our men time to get into their boats and steaming some distance  off whilst they did so. During the interval the Turks must have got wind  of British warships, for they rushed back in a great hurry and fired  torpedoes at so short a range that they passed under the ship. Very  exciting, we were told, watching them dart beneath the keel through the  crystal clear water. I can well believe it.    Went ashore in the afternoon to watch the Australian Artillery embark.  Spoke to a lot of the men, some of whom had met me during my tour  through Australia last year.    General Paris came to see me this evening.    _18th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Working all morning in  office. In the afternoon inspected embarkation of some howitzers.  D'Amade turned up later from the _Southland_. We went over the landing  at Kum Kale. He is in full sympathy and understands. Winter, Woodward  and their administrative Staffs also arrived in the _Southland_ and have  taken up their quarters on this ship. They report everything fixed up at  Alexandria before they sailed. We are all together now and their coming  will be a great relief to the General Staff.    Quite hot to-day. Sea dead smooth. The usual ebb and flow of visitors.  Saw the three Corps Commanders and many Staff Officers. We are rather on  wires now that the time is drawing near; Woodward, though he has only  been here one night, is on barbed wires. His cabin is next the  signallers and he could not get to sleep. He wants some medical  detachments sent up post haste from Alexandria. I have agreed to cable  for them and now he is more calm. A big pow-wow on the \"Q.E.\" (d'Amade,  Birdie, Hunter-Weston, Godley, Bridges, Guepratte, Thursby, Wemyss,  Phillimore, Vyvian, Dent, Loring), whereat the 23rd was fixed for our  attack and the naval landing orders were read and fully threshed out. I  did not attend as the meeting was rather for the purpose of going point  by point into orders already approved in principle than of starting any  fresh hares. Staff Officers who have only had to do with land operations  would be surprised, I am sure, at the amount of original thinking and  improvisation demanded by a landing operation. The Naval and Military  Beach Personnel is in itself a very big and intricate business which  has no place in ordinary soldier tactics. The diagrams of the ships and  transports; the lists of tows; the action of the Destroyers; tugs;  lighters; signal arrangements for combined operations: these are  unfamiliar subjects and need very careful fitting in. Braithwaite came  back and reported all serene; everyone keen and cooperating very  loyally. D'Amade has now received the formal letter I wrote him  yesterday after my interview and sees his way clear about Kum Kale.    Went ashore in the afternoon and saw big landing by Australians, who  took mules and donkeys with them and got them in and out of lighters.  These Australians are shaping into Marines in double quick time and  Cairo high jinks are wild oats sown and buried. Where everyone wants to  do well and to do it in the same way, discipline goes down as slick as  Mother's milk. Action is a discipline in itself.    The three Officers forming the French Mission to my Headquarters made  salaams, viz., Captain Bertier de Sauvigny, Lieutenant Pelliot and  Lieutenant de la Borde. The first is a man of the world, with manners  suave and distinguished; the second is a savant and knows the habits of  obscure and out of the way people. What de la Borde's points may be, I  do not know: he is a frank, good looking young fellow and spoke perfect  English.    _20th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ A big wind rose in the  night.    A clerk from my central office at the Horse Guards developed small pox  this morning. No doubt he has been in some rotten hole in Alexandria and  this is the result,--a disgusting one to all of us as we have had to be  vaccinated.    Ready now, but so long as the wind blows, we have to twiddle our thumbs.    Got the full text of d'Amades' orders for his Kum Kale landing as well  as for the Besika Bay make-believe.    _21st April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Blowing big guns. The event  with which old mother time is in labour is so big that her pains are  prodigious and prolonged out of all nature. So near are we now to our  opening that the storm means a twenty four hours' delay.    Have issued my orders to the troops. Yesterday our plans were but plans.  To-day the irrevocable steps out on to the stage.                                                    General Headquarters,                                                     _21st April, 1915._        _Soldiers of France and of the King._    Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war. Together with  our comrades of the Fleet, we are about to force a landing upon an open  beach in face of positions which have been vaunted by our enemies as  impregnable.    The landing will be made good, by the help of God and the Navy; the  positions will be stormed, and the War brought one step nearer to a  glorious close.    \"Remember,\" said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your Commander,  \"Remember, once you set foot upon the Gallipoli Peninsula, you must  fight the thing through to a finish.\"    The whole world will be watching your progress. Let us prove our selves  worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us.                                                IAN HAMILTON, _General_.    _22nd April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Wind worse than ever, but  weather brighter. Another twenty four hours' delay. Russian Military  Attache from Athens (Makalinsky) came to see me at 2.30 p.m. He cannot  give me much idea of how the minds of the Athenians are working. He says  our Russian troops are of the very best. Delay is the worst  nerve-cracker.    Charley Burn, King's Messenger, came; with him a Captain Coddan, to be  liaison between me and Istomine's Russians.    The King sends his blessing.                           SPECIAL ORDER,                                      General Headquarters,                                           _22nd April, 1915._    The following gracious message has been received to-day by the General  Commanding:--    \"The King wishes you and your Army every success, and you are  constantly in His Majesty's thoughts and prayers.\"    _23rd April, 1915.

All afternoon transports were very, very slowly coming out of harbour"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#19)"],[1,"a book which  contains such vile things as this: \"to avoid fornication, let every man  have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; ... it is  better to marry than to burn\"?[29] And is it _possible_ to be a  Christian so long as the origin of man is Christianized, which is to  say, _befouled_, by the doctrine of the _immaculata conceptio_?... I  know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of  women as in the Code of Manu; these old grey-beards and saints have a  way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, perhaps, to  surpass. \"The mouth of a woman,\" it says in one place, \"the breasts of a  maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always  pure.\" In another place: \"there is nothing purer than the light of the  sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a  maiden.\" Finally, in still another place--perhaps this is also a holy  lie--: \"all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all  below are impure. Only in the maiden is the whole body pure.\"    [29] 1 Corinthians vii, 2, 9.      57.    One catches the _unholiness_ of Christian means _in flagranti_ by the  simple process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the  ends sought by the Code of Manu--by putting these enormously  antithetical ends under a strong light. The critic of Christianity  cannot evade the necessity of making Christianity _contemptible_.--A  book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the same origin as every other  good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the sagacity and the  ethical experimentation of long centuries; it brings things to a  conclusion; it no longer creates. The prerequisite to a codification of  this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the  authority of a slowly and painfully attained _truth_ are fundamentally  different from those which one would make use of to prove it. A law-book  never recites the utility, the grounds, the casuistical antecedents of a  law: for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone, the \"thou  shall,\" on which obedience is based. The problem lies exactly here.--At  a certain point in the evolution of a people, the class within it of the  greatest insight, which is to say, the greatest hindsight and foresight,  declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall  live--or _can_ live--has come to an end. The object now is to reap as  rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment  and _hard_ experience. In consequence, the thing that is to be avoided  above everything is further experimentation--the continuation of the  state in which values are fluent, and are tested, chosen and criticized  _ad infinitum_. Against this a double wall is set up: on the one hand,  _revelation_, which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the  laws are _not_ of human origin, that they were _not_ sought out and  found by a slow process and after many errors, but that they are of  divine ancestry, and came into being complete, perfect, without a  history, as a free gift, a miracle...; and on the other hand,  _tradition_, which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged  from time immemorial, and that it is impious and a crime against one's  forefathers to bring it into question. The authority of the law is thus  grounded on the thesis: God gave it, and the fathers _lived_ it.--The  higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract  consciousness, step by step, from its concern with notions of right  living (that is to say, those that have been _proved_ to be right by  wide and carefully considered experience), so that instinct attains to a  perfect automatism--a primary necessity to every sort of mastery, to  every sort of perfection in the art of life. To draw up such a law-book  as Manu's means to lay before a people the possibility of future  mastery, of attainable perfection--it permits them to aspire to the  highest reaches of the art of life. _To that end the thing must be made  unconscious_: that is the aim of every holy lie.--The _order of castes_,  the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an _order  of nature_, of a natural law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary  fiat, no \"modern idea,\" can exert any influence. In every healthy  society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward  differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these  has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and  feeling of perfection. It is _not_ Manu but nature that sets off in one  class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are  marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who  are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only  mediocrity--the last-named represents the great majority, and the first  two the select. The superior caste--I call it the _fewest_--has, as the  most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for  beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of  men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can  goodness escape being weakness. _Pulchrum est paucorum hominum_:[30]  goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than  uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees  _ugliness_--or indignation against the general aspect of things.  Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. \"_The  world is perfect_\"--so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the  instinct of the man who says yes to life. \"Imperfection, whatever is  _inferior_ to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala  themselves are parts of this perfection.\" The most intelligent men, like  the _strongest_, find their happiness where others would find only  disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with  others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism  becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult  task as a privilege; it is to them a _recreation_ to play with burdens  that would crush all others.... Knowledge--a form of asceticism.--They  are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them  being the most cheerful and most amiable. They rule, not because they  want to, but because they _are_; they are not at liberty to play  second.--The _second caste_: to this belong the guardians of the law,  the keepers of order and security, the more noble warriors, above all,  the king as the highest form of warrior, judge and preserver of the law.  The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals,  the next to them in rank, taking from them all that is _rough_ in the  business of ruling--their followers, their right hand, their most apt  disciples.--In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing  \"made up\"; whatever is to the _contrary_ is made up--by it nature is  brought to shame.... The order of castes, the _order of rank_, simply  formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three  types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution  of higher types, and the highest types--the _inequality_ of rights is  essential to the existence of any rights at all.--A right is a  privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of  existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the _mediocre_.  Life is always harder as one mounts the _heights_--the cold increases,  responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand  only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly  consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture,  _science_, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of  _occupational_ activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and  aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the  instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as  to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a  wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not  _society_, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable  of, that makes them intelligent machines. To the mediocre mediocrity is  a form of happiness; they have a natural instinct for mastering one  thing, for specialization. It would be altogether unworthy of a profound  intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself. It is,  in fact, the _first_ prerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional:  it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization. When the  exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than  he applies to himself or to his equals, this is not merely kindness of  heart--it is simply his _duty_.... Whom do I hate most heartily among  the rabbles of today? The rabble of Socialists, the apostles to the  Chandala, who undermine the workingman's instincts, his pleasure, his  feeling of contentment with his petty existence--who make him envious  and teach him revenge.... Wrong never lies in unequal rights; it lies in  the assertion of \"equal\" rights.... What is _bad_? But I have already  answered: all that proceeds from weakness, from envy, from  _revenge_.--The anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry....    [30] Few men are noble.      58.    In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference:  whether one preserves thereby or destroys. There is a perfect likeness  between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points  only toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of  this: there it appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied  a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the  conditions which cause life to _flourish_ into an \"eternal\" social  organization,--Ch"]]]
