His master       had confidence in his resolution and prudence, while he was a great       favorite with all the hunters, and added much to their fun on dull       expeditions. On one occasion, when a party of white men in pursuit       of Indians who had stolen their horses called at Stockton's station       for reinforcements, Ben, among others, volunteered. They overtook       the savages at Kirk's Springs in Lewis county, and dismounted to       fight; but as they advanced, they could see only eight or ten, who       disappeared over the mountain. Pressing on, they discovered on       descending the mountain such indications as convinced them that the       few they had seen were but decoys to lead them into an ambuscade at       the base, and a retreat was ordered. Ben was told of it by a man       near him; but he was so intent on getting a shot that he did not       hear, and the order was repeated in a louder tone, whereupon he       turned upon his monitor a reproving look, grimaced and gesticulated       ludicrously, and motioned to the man to be silent. He then set off       rapidly down the mountain. His white comrade, unwilling to leave       him, ran after him, and reached his side just as he leveled his gun       at a big Indian standing tiptoe on a log and peering into the thick       woods. At the crack of Ben's rifle the savage bounded into the air       and fell. The others set up a fierce yell, and, as the fearless       Negro said, 'skipped from tree to tree like grasshoppers.' He       bawled out: 'Take dat to 'member Ben--de black white man!' and the       two beat a hasty retreat.         \"In the family of Capt. James Estill, who established a station       about fifteen miles south of Boonesborough, was a Negro slave,       Monk, who was intelligent, bold as a lion, and as faithful to his       pioneer friends as though he were a free white settler defending       his own rights. About daylight, March 20, 1782, when all the men of       the fort except four were absent on an Indian trail, a body of the       savages came upon Miss Jennie Glass, who was outside, but near the       station, milking--Monk being with her. They killed and scalped Miss       Glass and captured Monk. When questioned as to the force inside the       walls, the shrewd and self-possessed Negro represented it as much       greater than it was and told of preparations for defense. The       Indians were deceived, and after killing the cattle, they       retreated across the river. When the battle of Little Mountain       opened two days later, Monk, who was still a prisoner with the       Indians cried out: 'Don't give way, Mas' Jim! There's only about       twenty-five redskins and you can whip 'em!' This was valuable and       encouraging information to the whites. When the Indians began to       advance on Lieutenant Miller, when he was sent to prevent a flank       movement and guard the horse-holders, Monk called also to him to       hold his ground and the white men would win. Instead of being       instantly killed as was to be apprehended, even though the savages       might not understand his English, he made his escape before the       fight closed and got back to his friends. On their return to the       station, twenty-five miles, without sufficient horses for the       wounded, he carried on his back, most of the way, James Berry,       whose thigh was broken. He had learned to make gunpowder, and       obtaining saltpetre from Peyton's Cave, in Madison county, he       frequently furnished this indispensable article to Estill's Station       and Boonesborough. He has been described as being five feet five       inches high and weighing two hundred pounds. He was a respected       member of the Baptist church, when whites and blacks worshipped       together. He was held in high esteem by the settlers and his young       master, Wallace Estill, gave him his freedom and clothed and fed       him as long as he lived thereafter--till about 1835.         \"A year or two after the close of the Revolutionary war, a Mr.       Woods was living near Crab Orchard, Kentucky, with his wife, one       daughter (said to be ten years old), and a lame Negro man. Early       one morning, her husband being away, Mrs. Woods when a short       distance from the house, discovered seven or eight Indians in       ambush. She ran back into the house, so closely pursued that before       she could fasten the door one of the savages forced his way in. The       Negro instantly seized him. In the scuffle the Indian threw him,       falling on top. The Negro held him in a strong grasp and called to       the girl to take an axe which was in the room and kill him. This       she did by two well-aimed blows; and the Negro then asked Mrs.       Woods to let in another that he with the axe might dispatch him as       he came and so, one by one, kill them all. By this time, however,       some men from the station nearby, having discovered that the house       was attacked, had come up and opened fire on the savages, by which       one was killed and the others put to flight.\"          CHAPTER X.    FROM LEXINGTON TO CARRIZAL.      NEGRO IN WAR OF 1812--INCIDENT OF THE CHESAPEAKE--BATTLE OF LAKE  ERIE--PERRY'S FIGHTERS 10 PERCENT NEGROES--INCIDENT OF THE \"GOVERNOR  TOMPKINS\"--COLONISTS FORM NEGRO REGIMENTS--DEFENSE OF NEW  ORLEANS--ANDREW JACKSON'S TRIBUTE--NEGROES IN MEXICAN AND CIVIL WARS--IN  THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR--NEGROES IN THE PHILIPPINES--HEROES OF  CARRIZAL--GENERAL BUTLER'S TRIBUTE TO NEGROES--WENDELL PHILLIPS ON  TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE.      Prior to the actual war of 1812 and one of the most conspicuous causes  leading to it, was the attack on the Chesapeake, an American war vessel.  Here the Negro in the Navy figured in a most remarkable degree. The  vessel was hailed, fired upon and forced to strike her colors by the  British. She was boarded, searched and four persons taken from the crew  charged with desertion from the English navy. Three of these were  Negroes and one white. The charge against the Negroes could not have  been very strong, for they were dismissed, while the white man was  hanged.    The naval history of our second war with Great Britain is replete with  incidents concerning the participation of the Negro. Mackenzie's history  of the life of Commodore Perry states that at the famed battle of Lake  Erie, fully ten percent of the American crews were blacks. Perry spoke  highly of their bravery and good conduct. He said they seemed to be  absolutely insensible to danger. His fighters were a motley collection  of blacks, soldiers and boys. Nearly all had been afflicted with  sickness. Mackenzie says that when the defeated British commander was  brought aboard the \"Niagara\" and beheld the sickly and parti-colored  beings around him, an expression of chagrin escaped him at having been  conquered by such men.    The following extract is from a letter written by Commodore Nathaniel  Shaler of the armed schooner \"Governor Tompkins\", dated January 1, 1813.  Speaking of a fight with a British frigate, he said:         \"The name of one of my poor fellows who was killed ought to be       registered in the book of fame and remembered with reverence as       long as bravery is considered a virtue. He was a black man by the       name of John Johnson. A twenty-four-pound shot struck him in the       hip and tore away all the lower part of his body. In this state the       poor brave fellow lay on the deck and several times exclaimed to       his shipmates: 'Fire away, boys; don't haul the colors down.'       Another black man by the name of John Davis was struck in much the       same way. He fell near me and several times requested to be thrown       overboard, saying he was only in the way of the others. When       America has such tars, she has little to fear from the tyrants of       the ocean.\"    With the history fresh in mind of the successful Negro insurrection in  St. Domingo, bringing out so conspicuous a military and administrative  genius as Toussaint L'Ouverture, it is not surprising that the services  of Negroes as soldiers were not only welcomed, but solicited by various  states during the War of 1812. Excepting the battle of New Orleans,  almost all the martial glory of the struggle was on the water. New York,  however, passed a special act of the legislature and organized two  regiments of Negro troops, while there was heavy recruiting in other  states.    When in 1814 New Orleans was in danger, the free colored people of  Louisiana were called into the field with the whites. General Andrew  Jackson's commendatory address read to his colored troops December 18,  1814, is one of the highest compliments ever paid by a commander to his  troops. He said:         \"Soldiers!--when, on the banks of the Mobile, I called you to take       up arms, inviting you to partake of the perils and glory of your       white fellow-citizens, I expected much from you; for I was not       ignorant that you possessed qualities most formidable to an       invading enemy. I knew with what fortitude you could endure hunger       and thirst, and all the fatigues of a campaign. I knew well how you       loved your native country, and that you, as well as ourselves had       to defend what man holds most dear--his parents, wife, children and       property. You have done more than I expected. In addition to the       previous qualities I before knew you to possess, I found among you       a noble enthusiasm, which leads to the performance of great things.         \"Soldiers! The President of the United States shall hear how       praiseworthy was your conduct in the hour of danger, and the       representatives of the American people will give you the praise       your exploits entitle you to.

Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar  since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50  years. Argentines have responded to price stability by repatriating  capital and investing in domestic industry. Growth averaged more than  8%"]]]
