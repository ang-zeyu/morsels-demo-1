This is not a good sign. No one  else is present, yet they do not speak. This was not like perfect  happiness; but since the flight of Surja Mukhi, where had there been  perfect happiness? Kunda's thoughts were constantly seeking some means  by which things could be restored to their former state, and she now  ventured to ask Nagendra what could be done.    Nagendra, somewhat disturbed, replied: \"Do you wish things to be as  they were before? do you repent having married me?\"    Kunda Nandini felt hurt. She said: \"I never hoped that you would make  me happy by marrying me. I am not saying I repent it. I am asking what  can be done to induce Surja Mukhi to return.\"    \"Never speak of that. To hear the name of Surja Mukhi from your lips  gives me pain; on your account Surja Mukhi has abandoned me.\"    This was known to Kunda, yet to hear Nagendra say it hurt her. She  asked herself: \"Is this censure? How evil is my fate, yet I have  committed no fault; Surja Mukhi brought about the marriage.\" She did  not utter these thoughts aloud, but continued fanning.    Noticing her silence, Nagendra said: \"Why do you not talk? Are you  angry?\"    \"No,\" she replied.    \"Is a bare 'no' all you can say? Do you not longer love me?\"    \"Do I not love you!\"    \"'Do I not love you!' Words to soothe a boy. Kunda, I believe you  never loved me.\"    \"I have always loved you,\" said Kunda, earnestly.    Wise as Nagendra was, he did not comprehend the difference between  Surja Mukhi and Kunda Nandini. It was not that Kunda did not feel the  love for him that Surja Mukhi felt, but that she knew not how to  express it. She was a girl of a timid nature; she had not the gift of  words. What more could she say? But Nagendra, not understanding this,  said: \"Surja Mukhi always loved me. Why hang pearls on a monkey's  neck? an iron chain were better.\"    At this Kunda Nandini could not restrain her tears. Slowly rising, she  went out of the room. There was no one now to whom she could look for  sympathy. Kunda had not sought Kamal Mani since her arrival. Imagining  herself the one chiefly to blame in the marriage, Kunda had not dared  to show herself to Kamal Mani; but now, wounded to the quick, she  longed to go to her compassionate, loving friend, who on a former  occasion had soothed and shared her grief and wiped away her tears.  But now things were altered. When Kamal saw Kunda Nandini approaching  she was displeased, but she made no remark. Kunda, sitting down, began  to weep; but Kamal did not inquire into the cause of her grief, so  Kunda remained silent. Presently, Kamal Mani, saying \"I am busy,\" went  away. Kunda Nandini perceived that all joy is fleeting.          CHAPTER XXV.    THE FRUIT OF THE POISON TREE.      Nagendra's letter to Hara Deb Ghosal:    \"You wrote that of all the acts I have done in my life, my marriage  with Kunda Nandini is the most erroneous. I admit it. By doing this I  have lost Surja Mukhi. I was very fortunate in obtaining Surja Mukhi  for a wife. Every one digs for jewels, but only one finds the  Koh-i-nur. Surja Mukhi is the Koh-i-nur. In no respect can Kunda  Nandini fill her place. Why, then, did I instal Kunda Nandini in her  seat? Delusion, delusion; now I am sensible of it. I have waked up  from my dream to realize my loss. Now where shall I find Surja Mukhi?  Why did I marry Kunda Nandini? Did I love her? Certainly I loved her;  I lost my senses for her; my life was leaving me. But now I know this  was but the love of the eye; or else, when I have been only fifteen  days married, why do I say, 'Did I love her?' I love her still; but  where is my Surja Mukhi?    \"I meant to have written much more to-day; but I cannot, it is very  difficult.\"    Hara Deb Ghosal's reply:    \"I understand your state of mind. It is not that you do not love Kunda  Nandini; you do love her, but when you said it was the love of the eye  only, you spoke the truth. Towards Surja Mukhi your love is deep, but  for a couple of days it has been covered by the shadow of Kunda  Nandini. Now you understand that you have lost Surja Mukhi. So long as  the sun remains unclouded, we are warmed by his beams and we love the  clouds; but when the sun is gone we know that he was the eye of the  world. Not understanding your own heart, you have committed this great  error. I will not reproach you more, because you fell into it under a  delusion which it was very difficult to resist.    \"The mind has many different affections; men call them all love, but  only that condition of heart which is ready to sacrifice its own  happiness to secure that of another is true love. The passion for  beauty is not love. The unstable lust for beauty is no more love than  the desire of the hungry for rice. True love is the offspring of  reason. When the qualities of a lovable person are perceived by the  understanding, the heart being charmed by these qualities is drawn  towards the possessor; it desires union with that treasury of virtues  and becomes devoted to it. The fruits of this love are expansion of  the heart, self-forgetfulness, self-denial. This is true love.  Shakespeare, Valmiki, Madame de Stael, are its poets; as Kalidas,  Byron, Jayadeva are of the other species of love. The effect on the  heart produced by the sight of beauty is dulled by repetition. But  love caused by the good qualities of a person does not lose its charm,  because beauty has but one appearance, because virtues display  themselves anew in every fresh act. If beauty and virtues are found  together, love is quickly generated; but if once the intelligence be  the cause for love, it is of no importance whether beauty exists or  not. Towards an ugly husband or an ugly wife love of this kind holds a  firm place. The love produced by virtue as virtue is lasting  certainly, but it takes time to know these virtues; therefore this  love never becomes suddenly strong, it is of gradual growth. The  infatuation for beauty springs into full force at first sight; its  first strength is so uncontrollable that all other faculties are  destroyed by it. Whether it be a lasting love there is no means of  knowing. It thinks itself undying. So you have thought. In the first  strength of this infatuation your enduring love for Surja Mukhi became  invisible to your eyes. This delusion is inherent in man's nature;  therefore I do not censure you, rather I counsel you to strive to be  happy in this state.    \"Do not despair; Surja Mukhi will certainly return. How long can she  exist without seeing you? So long as she remains absent, do you  cherish Kunda Nandini. So far as I understand your letters she is not  without attractive qualities. When the infatuation for her beauty is  lessened, there may remain something to create a lasting love; if that  is so, you will be able to make yourself happy with her; and should  you not again see your elder wife you may forget her, especially as  the younger one loves you. Be not careless about love; for in love is  man's only spotless and imperishable joy, the final means by which his  nature can be elevated. Without love man could not dwell in this world  that he has made so evil.\"    Nagendra Natha's reply:    \"I have not answered your letter until now because of the trouble of  my mind. I understand all you have written, and I know your counsel is  good. But I cannot resolve to stay at home. A month ago my Surja Mukhi  left me, and I have had no news of her. I design to follow her; I  will wander from place to place in search of her. If I find her I  will bring her home, otherwise I shall not return. I cannot remain  with Kunda Nandini; she has become a pain to my eyes. It is not her  fault, it is mine, but I cannot endure to see her face. Formerly I  said nothing to her, but now I am perpetually finding fault with her.  She weeps--what can I do? I shall soon be with you.\"    As Nagendra wrote so he acted. Placing the care of everything in the  hands of the _Dewan_ during his temporary absence, he set forth on his  wanderings. Kamal Mani had previously gone to Calcutta; therefore of  the people mentioned in this narrative, Kunda Nandini alone was left  in the Datta mansion, and the servant Hira remained in attendance upon  her.    Darkness fell on the large household. As a brilliantly-lighted,  densely-crowded dancing-hall, resounding with song and music, becomes  dark, silent, and empty when the performance is over, so that immense  household became when abandoned by Surja Mukhi and Nagendra Natha.    As a child, having played for a day with a gaily painted doll, breaks  and throws it away, and by degrees, earth accumulating, grass springs  over it, so Kunda Nandini, abandoned by Nagendra Natha, remained  untended and alone amid the crowd of people in that vast house.    As when the forest is on fire the nests of young birds are consumed in  the flames, and the mother-bird bringing food, and seeing neither  tree, nor nest, nor young ones, with cries of anguish whirls in  circles round the fire seeking her nest, so did Nagendra wander from  place to place in search of Surja Mukhi.    As in the fathomless depths of the boundless ocean, a jewel having  fallen cannot again be seen, so Surja Mukhi was lost to sight.          CHAPTER XXVI.    THE SIGNS OF LOVE.      As a cotton rag placed near fire becomes burnt, so the heart of Hira  became ever more inflamed by the remarkable beauty of Debendra. Many a  time Hira's virtue and good name would have been endangered by  passion, but that Debendra's character for sensuality without love  came to her mind and proved a safeguard. Hira had great power of  self-control, and it was through this power that she, though not very  virtuous, had hitherto easily preserved her chastity. The more  certainly to rule her heart, Hira determined to go again to service.  She felt that in daily work her mind would be distracted, and she  would be able to forget"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#19)"],[1,"of song with only comparative success, partly because they did not fully  realize the nature of this form of art, partly because they could  not limit the sweep of the creative power within such narrow limits.  Schubert was a revelation to his countrymen in his musical treatment  of subjective passion, in his instinctive command over condensed,  epigrammatic expression. This rich and gifted life, however quiet in its  exterior facts, was great in its creative and spiritual manifestation.  Born at Vienna of humble parents, January 31, 1797, the early life of  Franz Schubert was commonplace in the extreme, the most interesting  feature being the extraordinary development of his genius. At the age of  fourteen he had made himself a master of counterpoint and harmony, and  composed a large mass of chamber-music and works for the piano. His  poverty was such that he was oftentimes unable to obtain the music-paper  with which to fasten the immortal thoughts that thronged through his  brain. It was two years later that his special creative function found  exercise in the production of the two great songs, the \"Erl-King\" and  the \"Serenade,\" the former of which proved the source of most of the  fame and money emolument he enjoyed during life. It is hardly needful to  speak of the power and beauty of this composition, the weird sweetness  of its melodies, the dramatic contrasts, the wealth of color and  shading in its varying phrases, the subtilty of the accompaniment, which  elaborates the spirit of the song itself. The piece was composed in  less than an hour. One of Schubert's intimates tells us that he left him  reading Goethe's great poem for the first time. He instantly conceived  and arranged the melody, and when the friend returned after a short  absence Schubert was rapidly noting the music from his head on paper.  When the song was finished he rushed to the Stadtconvict school, his  only _alma mater_, and sang it to the scholars. The music-master,  Rucziszka, was overwhelmed with rapture and astonishment, and embraced  the young composer in a transport of joy. When this immortal music was  first sung to Goethe, the great poet said: \"Had music, instead of words,  been my instrument of thought, it is so I would have framed the legend.\"    The \"Serenade\" is another example of the swiftness of Schubert's  artistic imagination. He and a lot of jolly boon-companions sat one  Sunday afternoon in an obscure Viennese tavern, known as the Biersack.  The surroundings were anything but conducive to poetic fancies--dirty  tables, floor, and ceiling, the clatter of mugs and dishes, the loud  dissonance of the beery German roisterers, the squalling of children,  and all the sights and noises characteristic of the beer-cellar. One of  our composer's companions had a volume of poems, which Schubert looked  at in a lazy way, laughing and drinking the while. Singling out some  verses, he said: \"I have a pretty melody in my head for these lines, if  I could only get a piece of ruled paper.\" Some staves were drawn on the  back of a bill-of-fare, and here, amid all the confusion and riot, the  divine melody of the \"Serenade\" was born, a tone-poem which embodies the  most delicate dream of passion and tenderness that the heart of man ever  conceived.    Both these compositions were eccentric and at odds with the old canons  of song, fancied with a grace, warmth, and variety of color hitherto  characteristic only of the more pretentious forms of music, which had  already been brought to a great degree of perfection. They inaugurate  the genesis of the new school of musical lyrics, the golden wedding of  the union of poetry with music.    For a long time the young composer was unsuccessful in his attempts to  break through the barren and irritating drudgery of a schoolmaster's  life. At last a wealthy young dilettante, Franz von Schober, who had  become an admirer of Schubert's songs, persuaded his mother to offer him  a fixed home in her house. The latter gratefully accepted the overture  of friendship, and thence became a daily guest at Schober's house. He  made at this time a number of strong friendships with obscure poets,  whose names only live through the music of the composer set to verses  furnished by them; for Schubert, in his affluence of creative power,  merely needed the slightest excuse for his genius to flow forth. But,  while he wrote nothing that was not beautiful, his masterpieces are  based only on themes furnished by the lyrics of such poets as Goethe,  Heine, and Rilckert. It is related, in connection with his friendship  with Mayrhofer, one of his rhyming associates of these days, that he  would set the verses to music much faster than the other could compose  them.    The songs of the obscure Schubert were gradually finding their way to  favor among the exclusive circles of Viennese aristocracy. A celebrated  singer of the opera, Vogl, though then far advanced in years, was much  sought after for the drawing-room concerts so popular in Vienna, on  account of the beauty of his art. Vogl was a warm admirer of Schubert's  genius, and devoted himself assiduously to the task of interpreting  it--a friendly office of no little value. Had it not been for this, our  composer would have sunk to his early grave probably without even the  small share of reputation and monetary return actually vouchsafed  to him. The strange, dreamy unconsciousness of Schubert is very well  illustrated in a story told by Vogl after his friend's death. One day  Schubert left a new song at the singer's apartments, which, being too  high, was transposed. Vogl, a fortnight afterward, sang it in the lower  key to his friend, who remarked: \"Really, that _Lied_ is not so bad; who  composed it?\"      III.    Our great composer, from the peculiar constitution of his gifts, the  passionate subjectiveness of his nature, might be supposed to have been  peculiarly sensitive to the fascinations of love, for it is in this  feeling that lyric inspiration has found its most fruitful root. But  not so. Warmly susceptible to the charms of friendship, Schubert for  the most part enacted the _role_ of the woman-hater, which was not all  affected; for the Hamletlike mood is only in part a simulated madness  with souls of this type. In early youth he would sneer at the amours  of his comrades. It is true he fell a victim to the charms of Theresa  Grobe, a beautiful soprano, who afterward became the spouse of a  master-baker. But the only genuine love-sickness of Schubert was of a  far different type, and left indelible traces on his nature, as its very  direction made it of necessity unfortunate. This was his attachment to  Countess Caroline Esterhazy.    The Count Esterhazy, one of those great feudal princes still extant  among the Austrian nobility, took a traditional pride in encouraging  genius, and found in Franz Schubert a noble object for the exercise of  his generous patronage. He was almost a boy (only nineteen), except in  the prodigious development of his genius, when he entered the Esterhazy  family as teacher of music, though always treated as a dear and familiar  friend. During the summer months, Schubert went with the Esterhazy s to  their country-seat at Zelesz, in Hungary. Here, amid beautiful scenery,  and the sweetness of a social life perfect of its kind, our poet's life  flew on rapid wings, the one bright, green spot of unalloyed happiness,  for the dream was delicious while it lasted. Here, too, his musical  life gathered a fresh inspiration, since he became acquainted with the  treasures of the national Hungarian music, with its weird, wild rhythms  and striking melodies. He borrowed the motives of many of his most  characteristic songs from these reminiscences of hut and hall, for  the Esterhazys were royal in their hospitality, and exercised a wide  patriarchal sway.    The beautiful Countess Caroline, an enthusiastic girl of great beauty,  became the object of a romantic passion. A young, inexperienced maiden,  full of _naive_ sweetness, the finest flower of the haughty Austrian  caste, she stood at an infinite distance from Schubert, while she  treated him with childlike confidence and fondness, laughing at his  eccentricities, and worshiping his genius, lie bowed before this idol,  and poured out all the incense of his heart. Schubert's exterior was  anything but that of the ideal lover. Rude, unshapely features, thick  nose, coarse, protruding mouth, and a shambling, awkward figure, were  redeemed only by eyes of uncommon splendor and depth, aflame with the  unmistakable light of the soul.    The inexperienced maiden hardly understood the devotion of the artist,  which found expression in a thousand ways peculiar to himself. Only  once he was on the verge of a full revelation. She asked him why he  had dedicated nothing to her. With abrupt, passionate intensity of tone  Schubert answered, \"What's the use of that? Everything belongs to you!\"  This brink of confession seems to have frightened him, for it is said  that after this he threw much more reserve about his intercourse with  the family, till it was broken off. Hints in his letters, and the deep  despondency which increased after this, indicate, however, that the  humbly-born genius never forgot his beautiful dream.    He continued to pour out in careless profusion songs, symphonies,  quartets, and operas, many of which knew no existence but in the score  till after his death, hardly knowing of himself whether the productions  had value or not. He created because it was the essential law of his  being, and never paused to contemplate or admire the beauties of his own  work. Schubert's body had been mouldering for several years, when his  wonderful symphony in C major, one of the _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of orchestral  composition, was brought to the attention of the world by the critical  admiration of Robert Schumann, who won the admiration of lovers of  music, not less by his"]]]
