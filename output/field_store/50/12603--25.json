QUESTION: Concerning the Most Great Festival.    ANSWER: The Most Great Festival commenceth late in the afternoon of the  thirteenth day of the second month of the year according to the Bayan. On  the first, ninth and twelfth days of this Festival, work is forbidden.    2. QUESTION: Concerning the Festival of the Twin Birthdays.    ANSWER: The Birth of the Abha Beauty(12) was at the hour of dawn on the  second day of the month of Muharram,(13) the first day of which marketh  the Birth of His Herald. These two days are accounted as one in the sight  of God.    3. QUESTION: Concerning the Marriage Verses.(14)    ANSWER: For men: \"We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.\" For  women: \"We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.\"    4. QUESTION: Should a man go on a journey without specifying a time for  his return--without indicating, in other words, the expected period of his  absence--and should no word be heard of him thereafter, and all trace of  him be lost, what course should be followed by his wife?    ANSWER: Should he have omitted to fix a time for his return despite being  aware of the stipulation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas in this regard, his wife  should wait for one full year, after which she shall be free either to  adopt the course that is praiseworthy, or to choose for herself another  husband. If, however, he be unaware of this stipulation, she should abide  in patience until such time as God shall please to disclose to her his  fate. By the course that is praiseworthy in this connection is meant the  exercise of patience.    5. QUESTION: Concerning the holy verse: \"When We heard the clamour of the  children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the  rest.\"    ANSWER: According to the Book of God, the estate of the deceased is  divided into 2,520 shares, which number is the lowest common multiple of  all integers up to nine, and these shares are then distributed into seven  portions, each of which is allocated, as mentioned in the Book, to a  particular category of heirs. The children, for example, are allotted nine  blocks of 60 shares, comprising 540 shares in all. The meaning of the  statement \"We doubled their share\" is thus that the children receive a  further nine blocks of 60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks  all told. The extra shares that they receive are deducted from the  portions of the other categories of heirs, so that, although it is  revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to \"eight parts  comprising four hundred and eighty shares\", which is the equivalent of  eight blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement, one and a  half blocks of shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have been subtracted  from the spouse's portion and reallocated to the children, and similarly  in the case of the others. The result is that the total amount subtracted  is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of shares allotted to the children.    6. QUESTION: Is it necessary that the brother, in order to qualify for his  portion of the inheritance, be descended from both the father and the  mother of the deceased, or is it sufficient merely that there be one  parent in common?    ANSWER: If the brother be descended from the father he shall receive his  share of the inheritance in the prescribed measure recorded in the Book;  but if he be descended from the mother, he shall receive only two thirds  of his entitlement, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.  This ruling is also applicable to the sister.    7. QUESTION: Amongst the provisions concerning inheritance it hath been  laid down that, should the deceased leave no offspring, their share of the  estate is to revert to the House of Justice. In the event of other  categories of heirs, such as the father, mother, brother, sister and  teacher being similarly absent, do their shares of the inheritance also  revert to the House of Justice, or are they dealt with in some other  fashion?    ANSWER: The sacred verse sufficeth. He saith, exalted be His Word: \"Should  the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of  Justice\" etc. and \"Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the  other categories of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall  receive two thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert  to the House of Justice\" etc. In other words, where there are no  offspring, their allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the  House of Justice; and where there are offspring but the other categories  of heirs are lacking, two thirds of the inheritance pass to the offspring,  the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice. This ruling hath  both general and specific application, which is to say that whenever any  category of this latter class of heirs is absent, two thirds of their  inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of  Justice.    8. QUESTION: Concerning the basic sum on which Huququ'llah is payable.    ANSWER: The basic sum on which Huququ'llah is payable is nineteen  mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold. In other words, when money to the value of this sum  hath been acquired, a payment of Huquq falleth due. Likewise Huquq is  payable when the value, not the number, of other forms of property  reacheth the prescribed amount. Huququ'llah is payable no more than once.  A person, for instance, who acquireth a thousand mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold, and  payeth the Huquq, is not liable to make a further such payment on this  sum, but only on what accrueth to it through commerce, business and the  like. When this increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the  prescribed sum, one must carry out what God hath decreed. Only when the  principal changeth hands is it once more subject to payment of Huquq, as  it was the first time. The Primal Point hath directed that Huququ'llah  must be paid on the value of whatsoever one possesseth; yet, in this Most  Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings, that is  such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself.    9. QUESTION: Which is to take precedence: the Huququ'llah, the debts of  the deceased or the cost of the funeral and burial?    ANSWER: The funeral and burial take precedence, then settlement of debts,  then payment of Huququ'llah. Should the property of the deceased prove  insufficient to cover his debts, the remainder of his estate should be  distributed among these debts in proportion to their size.    10. QUESTION: Shaving the head hath been forbidden in the Kitab-i-Aqdas  but enjoined in the Suriy-i-Hajj.    ANSWER: All are charged with obedience to the Kitab-i-Aqdas; whatsoever is  revealed therein is the Law of God amid His servants. The injunction on  pilgrims to the sacred House to shave the head hath been lifted.    11. QUESTION: If intercourse take place between a couple during their year  of patience, and they become estranged again thereafter, must they  recommence their year of patience, or may the days preceding the  intercourse be included in the reckoning of the year? And once divorce  hath taken place, is it necessary that a further period of waiting be  observed?    ANSWER: Should affection be renewed between the couple during their year  of patience, the marriage tie is valid, and what is commanded in the Book  of God must be observed; but once the year of patience hath been completed  and that which is decreed by God taketh place, a further period of waiting  is not required. Sexual intercourse between husband and wife is forbidden  during their year of patience, and whoso committeth this act must seek  God's forgiveness, and, as a punishment, render to the House of Justice a  fine of nineteen mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold.    12. QUESTION: Should antipathy develop between a couple after the Marriage  Verses have been read and the dowry paid, may divorce take place without  observance of the year of patience?    ANSWER: Divorce may legitimately be sought after the reading of the  Marriage Verses and payment of the dowry, but before the consummation of  the marriage. In such circumstances there is no need for observance of a  year of patience, but recovery of the dowry payment is not permissible.    13. QUESTION: Is the consent of the parents on both sides prerequisite to  marriage, or is that of the parents on one side sufficient? Is this law  applicable only to virgins or to others as well?    ANSWER: Marriage is conditional upon the consent of the parents of both  parties to the marriage, and in this respect it maketh no difference  whether the bride be a virgin or otherwise.    14. QUESTION: The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of  the Qiblih when reciting their Obligatory Prayers; in what direction  should they turn when offering other prayers and devotions?    ANSWER: Facing in the direction of the Qiblih is a fixed requirement for  the recitation of obligatory prayer, but for other prayers and devotions  one may follow what the merciful Lord hath revealed in the Qur'an:  \"Whichever way ye turn, there is the face of God.\"    15. QUESTION: Concerning the remembrance of God in the  Mas{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~CO"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#19)"],[1,"the men's unfounded fears, and called upon them  to prove themselves worthy of the high character they had hitherto  maintained; he concluded by warning all ranks that the Government were  determined not to yield to insubordination, which would be visited  with the severest punishment.    The demeanour of the sepoys was most respectful, and when the parade  was over they expressed their high sense of the Commander-in-Chief's  goodness. They declared that he had removed their own objections,  but that the story was universally believed by their countrymen and  relations, and if they were to use the cartridge they must become  social outcasts.    General Anson, feeling that the doubts and anxieties of the men with  regard to the use of the new cartridges were by no means imaginary,  suspended their issue until a special report had been prepared as to  the composition of the paper in which they were wrapped.[1]    Having thus done all that he could at the time to allay any feeling of  uneasiness, and hoping that the news of the disbandment of the 19th  Native Infantry would check the spirit of insubordination, General  Anson continued his journey to Simla, that beautiful place in the  Himalayas, 7,000 feet above the sea, which has since become the seat  of the Government of India and Army Head-Quarters during the hot  weather months.    The Commander-in-Chief had been at Simla rather more than a month,  when, on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 12th May, an Aide-de-camp  galloped in from Umballa (the Head-Quarters station of the Sirhind  division), distant eighty miles, bringing with him a copy of the  telegraphic message which had been despatched from Delhi the previous  day to 'all stations in the Punjab,' and which had caused such  consternation at Peshawar on the evening of the 11th May.    Sir Henry Barnard, commanding the Sirhind division, desired the  Aide-de-camp (his own son) to inform the Commander-in-Chief that  the temper of the three Native regiments at Umballa was more than  doubtful, and that it seemed advisable that the three regiments of  British Infantry stationed in the hills near Simla should be ordered  at once to Umballa. So urgent did this seem to Barnard, that, in  anticipation of sanction from the Commander-in-Chief, he told his son  to warn the 75th Foot as he passed through Kasauli to be prepared for  an immediate move.    General Anson at once saw the necessity for taking prompt action. That  same afternoon he despatched an Aide-de-camp to Kasauli to order the  75th to proceed without delay to Umballa, and the 1st Bengal Fusiliers  at Dagshai to follow the 75th as soon as carriage could be collected;  also to warn the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers at Subathu to be ready to move.  Expresses were sent at the same [time] to Ferozepore and Jullundur  directing that a European guard should be placed in charge of the  magazine at the former place, and a detachment of European Infantry  thrown into the fort of Philour from the latter. The confidence  reposed in the Native army before the Mutiny was so great that these  two important magazines, like almost all the arsenals and magazines in  India, were guarded by Native soldiers, and subsequent events proved  that, but for General Anson's timely precautions, the mutineers  must have obtained possession of the magazines at Ferozepore and  Philour.[2]    Anson had not long to wait before he received confirmation of the  alarming news brought by General Barnard's son. The very next  afternoon a letter arrived from Meerut giving an account of the  outbreak on the 10th, and a few particulars of what had occurred at  Delhi. The Commander-in-Chief immediately decided on proceeding to  Umballa, to superintend personally the organization of the force  which, as he rightly judged, would have to be sent to Delhi. There  was no hesitation on General Anson's part, or delay in issuing the  necessary orders.[3] The 2nd Bengal Fusiliers were directed to march  to Umballa, and an Artillery officer was sent express to Philour with  instructions for a third-class siege-train to be got ready, and for  reserve Artillery and Infantry ammunition to be despatched to Umballa.  Orders were also issued for the Nasiri battalion, stationed at Jutog,  near Simla, and for the company of Native Artillery at Kangra and  Nurpur[4] to march with all expedition to Philour, for the purpose of  accompanying the siege-train; and for the Sirmur battalion of Gurkhas  at Dehra Dun, and the Sappers and Miners at Rurki, to proceed to  Meerut.    Having thus pressed forward the measures for the suppression of the  revolt which to him seemed most urgent, General Anson left Simla early  on the 14th May, within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the first  news of the outbreak, and reached Umballa the following morning. His  last act at Simla was to draft a circular which he hoped would have  the effect of allaying excitement in the Native army.    The report which Sir Henry Barnard had to make to the Chief on his  arrival at Umballa was not reassuring. The troops at that station  consisted of Her Majesty's 9th Lancers, two troops of Horse Artillery,  the 4th Bengal Light Cavalry, and two regiments of Native Infantry.  The 75th Foot and 1st Bengal Fusiliers had just marched in with only  thirty and seventy rounds of ammunition per man, respectively, and  (from want of carriage) without tents or baggage. The Commissariat and  Medical Departments were totally unprepared to meet the requirements  of a force suddenly ordered to take the field; there were no doolies  for the sick; supplies were difficult to collect, for the bazaars  were partially deserted; there was a scarcity of contractors, and no  ammunition was available nearer than Philour, eighty miles off.    At Delhi all the Europeans who had not escaped had been massacred, and  the city had been taken possession of by the Native garrison and the  mutinous troops from Meerut in the name of the old King.    At Meerut the European troops were entrenching themselves; the  surrounding district was in the most complete disorder, and the civil  courts powerless.    At Umballa and Jullundur, although the presence of European troops had  hitherto kept the Native regiments from open mutiny, it was evident  that they were not in the least to be depended upon.    At Ferozepore an aggravated revolt had occurred, and at Lahore it had  been found necessary to disarm all the Native troops.    From below Meerut there was no intelligence whatever, but it seemed  more than probable that the spirit of rebellion had broken out in many  stations, and later this was known to be the case.    To add to the Commander-in-Chief's anxieties, it was reported that the  Nasiri battalion at Jutog had got out of hand for a time and refused  to march to Philour, while a detachment of the same corps at Kasauli  plundered the treasury, rendering it necessary to send back 100 men  of the 75th Foot to reinforce the depot at that place, where a large  number of European soldiers' families were collected.    The behaviour of the Gurkhas gave rise to a panic at Simla,  which, however, did not last long. Lord William Hay,[5] who was  Deputy-Commissioner at the time, induced most of the ladies,  with their children, to seek a temporary asylum with the Raja of  Kiunthal.[6] Hay himself managed to keep Simla quiet, and the men  of the Nasiri battalion coming to their senses, order was restored  throughout the hills. The money taken from the Kasauli treasury was  nearly all voluntarily given up, and before the year was out the  battalion did us good service.    It was a long list of troubles that was placed before the  Commander-in-Chief. Disturbing as they all were, each requiring prompt  and special action, there was one amongst them which stood out in bold  relief--the situation at Delhi; and to wrest that stronghold from the  hands of the mutineers was, General Anson conceived, his most pressing  obligation. But could it be done with the means at his disposal?  He thought not; and in this opinion he was supported by the senior  officers at Umballa, with whom the question was anxiously discussed at  a conference held at Sir Henry Barnard's house on the 16th May.[7] It  was nevertheless determined to push on to Delhi, and General Hewitt  was asked what force he could spare from Meerut to co-operate with the  Umballa column. He was warned that time was an object, and that the  23rd May was the date on which his troops would probably be required  to start. All details were carefully considered. The first difficulty  to be overcome was the want of carriage. No organized system of  transport--one of the most essential requirements of an efficient  army--existed, and, owing to the restlessness and uncertainty which  prevailed throughout the country, the civil authorities were unable to  collect carts and camels with the usual rapidity.[8]    That afternoon General Anson received a letter from Sir John Lawrence  urging the importance of an immediate advance on Delhi, and giving an  outline of the measures he proposed to adopt in the Punjab. He asked  the Commander-in-Chief to give a general sanction to the arrangements,  and concluded with these words: \"I consider this to be the greatest  crisis which has ever occurred in India. Our European force is so  small that, unless effectively handled in the outset, and brought to  bear, it will prove unequal to the emergency. But with vigour and  promptitude, under the blessing of God, it will prove irresistible.\"    Anson naturally hesitated to advance with an inefficient and only  partially equipped force against a strongly-fortified city with  an immense armed population, defended by many thousand desperate  mutineers, and in his reply (dated the 17th May) he put the case  plainly before Sir John Lawrence. He pointed out that the Europeans  were without tents; that there were no guns at Umballa or Meerut  heavier than six or nine pounders with "]]]
