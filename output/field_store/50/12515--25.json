If Tula was subsequently invented, and if instead of the  three signs \"Kanya,\" \"Tula,\" and \"Vrischikam,\" there had existed  formerly only one sign combining in itself Kanya and Vrischika, the sign  now under consideration was the eighth sign under the old system, and it  is a significant fact that Sanskrit writers generally speak also of  \"Ashtadisa\" or eight faces bounding space.  It is quite possible that  the number of disa might have been altered from 8 to 10 when the  formerly existing Virgo-Scorpio was split up into three separate signs.    Again, Kara may be taken to represent the projecting triangles of the  five-pointed star.  This figure may also be called a kind of regular  pentagon (see Todhunter's \"Spherical Trigonometry,\" p. 143).  If this  interpretation is accepted, the Rasi or sign in question represents the  \"microcosm.\"  But the \"microcosm\" or the world of thought is really  represented by Vrischika.  From an objective point of view the  \"microcosm\" is represented by the human body. Makaram may be taken to  represent simultaneously both the microcosm and the macrocosm, as  external objects of perception.    In connection with this sign I shall state a few important facts which I  beg to submit for the consideration of those who are interested in  examining the ancient occult sciences of India.  It is generally held by  the ancient philosophers that the macrocosm is similar to the microcosm  in having a Sthula Sariram and a Suksma Sariram.   The visible universe  is the Sthula Sariram of Viswam;  the ancient philosophers held that as  a substratum for this visible universe, there is another universe--  perhaps we may call it the universe of Astral Light--the real universe  of Noumena, the soul as it were of this visible universe.  It is darkly  hinted in certain passages of the Veda and the Upanishads that this  hidden universe of Astral Light is to be represented by an Icosahedron.  The connection between an Icosahedron and a Dodecahedron is something  very peculiar and interesting, though the figures seem to be so very  dissimilar to each other.  The connection may be understood by the  under-mentioned geometrical construction.  Describe a Sphere about an  Icosahedron;  let perpendiculars be drawn from the centre of the Sphere  on its faces and produced to meet the surface of the Sphere.  Now, if  the points of intersection be joined, a Dodecahedron is formed within  the Sphere.  By a similar process an Icosahedron may be constructed from  a Dodecahedron.  (See Todhunter's \"Spherical Trigonometry,\" p. 141, art.  193).  The figure constructed as above described will represent the  universe of matter and the universe of Astral Light as they actually  exist.  I shall not now, however, proceed to show how the universe of  Astral Light may be considered under the symbol of an Icosahedron.  I  shall only state that this conception of the Aryan philosophers is not  to be looked upon as mere \"theological twaddle\" or as the outcome of  wild fancy.  The real significance of the conception in question can, I  believe, be explained by reference to the psychology and the physical  science of the ancients.  But I must stop here and proceed to consider  the meaning of the remaining two signs.    XI. Kumbha (or Aquarius).--When represented by numbers, the word is  equivalent to 14.  It can be easily perceived then that the division in  question is intended to represent the \"Chaturdasa Bhuvanam,\" or the 14  lokas spoken of in Sanskrit writings.    XII. Mina (or Pisces).--This word again is represented by 5 when written  in numbers, and is evidently intended to convey the idea of  Panchamahabhutams or the 5 elements.  The sign also suggests that water  (not the ordinary water, but the universal solvent of the ancient  alchemists) is the most important amongst the said elements.    I have now finished the task which I have set to myself in this article.  My purpose is not to explain the ancient theory of evolution itself, but  to show the connection between that theory and the Zodiacal divisions.  I have herein brought to light but a very small portion of the  philosophy imbedded in these signs. The veil that was dexterously thrown  over certain portions of the mystery connected with these signs by the  ancient philosophers will never be lifted up for the amusement or  edification of the uninitiated public.    Now to summarize the facts stated in this article, the contents of the  first chapter of the history of this universe are as follows:    1.  The self-existent, eternal Brahmam.    2.  Pranava (Aum).    3.  The androgyne Brahma, or the bisexual Sephira-Adam Kadmon.    4.  The Sacred Tetragram--the four matras of Pranava--the four      avasthas--the four states of Brahma--the Sacred Dharaka.    5.  The five Brahmas--the five Buddhas representing in their totality      the Jivatma.    6.  The Astral Light--the holy Virgin--the six forces in Nature.    7.  The thirty-six Tatwams born of Avidya.    8.  The universe in thought--the Swapna Avastha--the microcosm looked at      from a subjective point of view.    9.  The nine Prajapatis--the assistants of the Demiurgus.*    10.  The shape of the material universe in the mind of the Demiurgus--       the DODECAHEDRON.    11.  The fourteen lokas.    12.  The five elements.    --------  * The nine Kabalistic Sephiroths emanated from Sephira the 10th and the  head Sephiroth are identical.

Subba Row  Triplicane, Madras, September 14, 1881          The Sishal and Bhukailas Yogis    We are indebted to the kindness of the learned President of the Adi  Brahmo Samaji for the following accounts of two Yogis, of whom one  performed the extraordinary feats of raising his body by will power, and  keeping it suspended in the air without visible support.  The Yoga  posture for meditation or concentration of the mind upon spiritual  things is called Asana.  There are various of these modes of sitting,  such as Padmasan, &c. &c.  Babu Rajnarain Bose translated this narrative  from a very old number of the Tatwabodhini Patrika, the Calcutta organ  of the Brahmo Samaj. The writer was Babu Akkhaya Kumar Dalta, then  editor of the Patrika, of whom Babu Rajnarain speaks in the following  high terms--\"A very truth-loving and painstaking man;  very fond of  observing strict accuracy in the details of a description.\"    Sishal Yogi    A few years ago, a Deccan Yogi, named Sishal, was seen at Madras, by  many Hindus and Englishmen, to raise his Asana, or seat, up into the  air.  The picture of the Yogi, showing his mode of seating, and other  particulars connected with him, may be found in the Saturday Magazine on  page 28.    His whole body seated in air, only his right hand lightly touched a deer  skin, rolled up in the form of a tube, and attached to a brazen rod  which was firmly stuck into a wooden board resting on four legs.  In  this position the Yogi used to perform his japa (mystical meditation),  with his eyes half shut.  At the time of his ascending to his aerial  seat, and also when he descended from it, his disciples used to cover  him with a blanket.  The Tatwabodhini Patrika, Chaitra, 1768 Sakabda,  corresponding to March 1847.      The Bhukailas Yogi    The extraordinary character of the holy man who was brought to  Bhukailas, in Kidderpore, about 14 years ago, may still be remembered by  many.  In the month of Asar, 1754 Sakabda (1834 A.C.), he was brought to  Bhukailas from Shirpur, where he was under the charge of Hari Singh, the  durwan (porter) of Mr. Jones. He kept his eyes closed, and went without  food and drink, for three consecutive days, after which a small quantity  of milk was forcibly poured down his throat.  He never took any food  that was not forced upon him.  He seemed always without external  consciousness.  To remove this condition Dr. Graham applied ammonia to  his nostrils;  but it only produced tremblings in the body, and did not  break his Yoga state.  Three days passed before he could be made to  speak.  He said that his name was Dulla Nabab, and when annoyed, he  uttered a single word, from which it was inferred that he was a Punjabi.  When he was laid up with gout Dr. Graham attended him, but he refused to  take medicine, either in the form of powder or mixture.  He was cured of  the disease only by the application of ointments and liniments  prescribed by the doctor.  He died in the month of Chaitra 1755 Sakabda,  of a choleric affection.*--The Tatwabodhini Patrika, Chaitra, 1768  Sakabda, corresponding to March, 1847 A.C.    --------  * The above particulars of this holy man have been obtained on  unexceptionable testimony.--Ed.

The doctrine of the trinity, or trichotomy of  man, which distinguishes soul from spirit, comes to us with such  weighty, venerable, and even sacred authority, that we may well be  content, for the moment, with confirmations that should be intelligible  to all, forbearing the abstruser questions which have divided minds of  the highest philosophical capacity.  We will not now inquire whether the  difference is one of states or of entities;  whether the phenomenal or  mind consciousness is merely the external condition of one indivisible  Ego, or has its origin and nature in an altogether different principle;  the Spirit, or immortal part of us, being of Divine birth, while the  senses and understanding, with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#19)"],[1,"       rule that the more time I devote to each production, the more       favour it meets with from the public.         \"It is now a good many years (seven or eight I believe) since you       were kind enough at my request to raise the payment of the quarter       page....         \"Since that period I have gradually become enabled thro' the       improvement in my health to give much more of my time to my _Punch_       work--all the drawings selected by you for 'English Society at       Home' have been done since then--and whatever other qualities they       may possess, they are very careful and elaborate in most instances,       and without this care and elaboration they would lose most of their       value in the world's eye....\"    Then follows details as to the revision of the prices. And then a day  or two later he sends the following letter:         \"_Jan._ 4, 1880.         \"Mr DEAR BRADBURY,--Many thanks for your kind note. It is really a       painful effort to me to 'ask for more,' and I've been putting it       off from day to day these six months. The pleasure and enthusiasm       with which I have got to do my work for _Punch_ (since I have got       better in health and so forth) are such that I should be content to       go on so for ever, without any rise, if it weren't for my having       such a deuce of a family! but what's a fellow to do!         \"You've no idea what it is to go trapesing up and down, hunting for       a subject, _while all the time the hand remains idle. Punch_       requires such a lot of thought, you see--and then when the time       comes for the hand to do its work, you can see what care and time       are taken with the execution....         \"I only wish it would suit the convenience of _Punch_ to take all       the work I could send on a scale of prices literally fixed by       myself!

The  dog holds a tin and begs from a passing fine lady, a well-known beauty  of Society and the Stage, and the legend \"Sic transit Gloria Mundi\"  describes the situation.    [Illustration]      Section 8    The above letters were dated from New Grove House, Hampstead, where the  du Mauriers lived for twenty-one years. They had moved into this house  from Church Row, where they had gone when they first came to Hampstead,  and where their youngest son was born. During the period of their long  residence in New Grove House they frequently took a furnished house for  the winter season in Town for the convenience of going into Society. It  was the inaccessibility of Hampstead before the days of the Hampstead  Tube that made du Maurier latterly relinquish many social engagements,  and developed the disinclination for theatre-going which I have seen  ascribed to an aversion from the drama.    Sir Frederick Wedmore says that it was at Hampstead evening parties that  du Maurier found his type of the Adonis up-to-date. Alas, that even by  Sir Frederick Wedmore the type should be regarded as salient of du  Maurier's pictures. It is further evidence that the artist is only  remembered by his later pictures. It is in these the type  monotonously appears. But we feel better disposed towards Hampstead  when the eminent critic adds that Church Row itself gave du Maurier more  than one of the models in whom one recognises his ideal of youthful  feminine charm.    [Illustration: Manuscript of \"Nocturne\"    \"Sun of the Sleepless--Melancholy Star!\"--BYRON.    Translated into French by George du Maurier.    _The English Illustrated Magazine_, September 13, 1886.]    Du Maurier's tastes were very quiet. His interests were centred in his  home, and he found no companionship more acceptable than that of his own  children. He was not at all fond of being alone. He preferred even to  work with people round him; writing his novels in the drawing-room  standing with the MS. upon the top of the piano, and walking up and down  undisturbed by the conversation of his family round him. It caused him  no annoyance when members of his family broke into his studio during  working hours. His work both as draughtsman and writer was always  produced without any of that pathetic travail which for many artists and  writers lies between conception and expression. He did not exhibit the  most unpleasant of the traits of a talented person--the overstrung  condition of nerves which makes a man unpleasant to a household; he  preserved the serenity that pertains to greater genius still. His house  was always an open one, and the life in it must have been highly  typical of that English family life of which he was the pre-eminent poet  in his drawings.    Du Maurier was elected a member of the Athenaeum Club under Rule 2. He  showed his appreciation of this Club by not making use of any other,  though he was such a highly sociable man. He was early a member of the  Arts Club, though using it less frequently after its removal to the  Dover Street house, of old-world distinction. At the Athenaeum he  frequented the billiard-room as a sociable place, though he was not very  fond of billiards or card games. He could get on quite well in life upon  \"conversation\" as a recreation, interspersed with music.    After the great _Trilby_ boom, and when he was writing _The Martian_--in  fact, only a year before his death, the artist moved into town to live  in Oxford Square. He was partly influenced in this by the expiration of  the twenty-one years' lease upon which he held the Hampstead property.    In a paper contributed to the _Hampstead Annual_ for 1897, the issue  following the artist's death, Canon Ainger traced various Hampstead  spots to be identified as the backgrounds of du Maurier's subjects, and  recalls how on Hampstead Heath many subjects for _Punch_ came to be  discussed between them in the course of conversation. He describes the  way that one of the artist's most famous jests, in the days of Maudle  and Postlethwaite, took its final shape one day in Hampstead, and by a  singular chance arose out of a University sermon at Cambridge.    A certain well-known humorist of the time had remarked that the  objection to Blue China (it was the special craze at the moment) was  that it was so difficult to \"live up to it.\" This utterance had been  lately taken somewhat over-seriously by a special preacher before the  University who, discoursing on the growing extravagances and frivolities  of the age, wound up an indignant tirade by an eloquent peroration to  the effect that things had come to a sad pass when persons were found to  talk of \"_living up_--to a Tea-pot.\" At this juncture the jest seemed  ripe for treatment, and du Maurier thereupon produced his famous drawing  of the aesthetic bride and bridegroom comparing notes over the precious  piece of crockery in question: \"Oh! Algernon! Let us live up to it!\"    Speaking of fifteen years of constant companionship in walks upon the  Heath, the Canon says no one could have had a better opportunity of  tasting the unfailing charm of du Maurier's conversation, the width of  his reading and observation, and his inexhaustible fund of anecdote. In  these conversations Canon Ainger heard every detail of his companion's  school life, his studio-life in Paris, which afterwards found a place in  the pages of his three novels.    Referring to the long years of uninterrupted achievement of the artist's  life at Hampstead, \"only once,\" says his friend, \"in all the years I  knew him was he forced to lay his pencil by for a season. His solitary  eye had temporarily failed him, but, with spirits unsubdued, he promptly  took up the art of lecturer with marked success, although from the first  it was against the grain. When, however, after an interval his sight  returned to him, and the literary instinct, encouraged doubtless by the  success of his lectures, began to quicken, he gained, we all know,  though then past fifty years of age, a new public and a new career in  writing fiction.\" \"Except,\" proceeds Canon Ainger, \"to his intimate  friends and to his colleagues on _Punch_ the display of this gift was an  absolute surprise.... He wrote with extraordinary and even dangerous  facility. It is fair, however, to add that his best passages were often  produced as rapidly as all the rest. For instance, the scene in _Trilby_  when the mother and uncle of Little Billee arrive in Paris, hearing of  the engagement, and have their first interview with Taffy, was written  straight off one evening between dinner and bed-time.\" This scene, in  the judgment of Ainger, represents du Maurier at his high-water mark as  a novelist and as a worthy follower of the great master on whom his  style was undoubtedly based.    \"Hampstead,\" continues the Canon, \"was a real foster-mother to George du  Maurier, not only in what it brought him but in what it saved him from.  He was by nature and by practice one of the most generous and hospitable  of men. He loved to entertain his friends from town, and to take them  afterwards his favourite walks. But he disliked dinners and evening  parties in London, not because he was unsociable, but because good  dinners and long journeys 'took it out of him' and endangered the task  of the following morning. The distance from town and the long hills made  late hours inevitable. To listen to some new book read aloud in the  studio, which was also the common sitting-room of wife and children,  made the chief happiness of his evening.\"    \"We owed it,\" says his friend, \"to Hampstead air with its many sylvan  beauties that du Maurier was able for so long, notwithstanding defective  sight and health gradually failing, to prosecute his daily work with  scarce an interruption.\"    The link between the place and the work produced in it is in the case of  du Maurier, apart from the fact"]]]
