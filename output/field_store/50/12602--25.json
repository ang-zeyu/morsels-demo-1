(#19)"],[1,"John, earl of Bridgwater, then president of Wales: It appears  from the edition of this Masque, published by Mr. Henry Lawes, that  the principal performers were, the Lord Barclay, Mr. Thomas Egerton,  the Lady Alice Egerton, and Mr. Lawes himself, who represented an  attendant spirit.    The Prologue, which we found in the General Dictionary, begins with  the following lines.      Our stedfast bard, to his own genius true,    Still bad his muse fit audience find, tho' few;    Scorning the judgment of a trifling age,    To choicer spirits he bequeath'd his page.    He too was scorned, and to Britannia's shame,    She scarce for half an age knew Milton's name;    But now his fame by every trumpet blown,    We on his deathless trophies raise our own.    Nor art, nor nature, could his genius bound:    Heaven, hell, earth, chaos, he survey'd around.    All things his eye, thro' wit's bright empire thrown,    Beheld, and made what it beheld his own.    In 1637 Our author published his Lycidas; in this poem he laments the  death of his friend Mr. Edward King, who was drowned in his passage  from Chester on the Irish seas in 1637; it was printed the year  following at Cambridge in 4to. in a collection of Latin and English  poems upon Mr. King's death, with whom he had contracted the strongest  friendship. The Latin epitaph informs us, that Mr. King was son of Sir  John King, secretary for Ireland to Queen Elizabeth, James I. and  Charles I. and that he was fellow in Christ's-College Cambridge, and  was drowned in the twenty-fifth year of his age. But this poem of  Lycidas does not altogether consist in elegiac strains of tenderness;  there is in it a mixture of satire and severe indignation; for in part  of it he takes occasion to rally the corruptions of the established  clergy, of whom he was no favourer; and first discovers his acrimony  against archbishop Laud; he threatens him with the loss of his head, a  fate which he afterwards met, thro' the fury of his enemies; at least,  says Dr. Newton, I can think of no sense so proper to be given to the  following verses in Lycidas;      Besides what the grim wolf, with privy paw,    Daily devours apace, and nothing said;    But that two-handed engine at the door,    Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.    Upon the death of his mother, Milton obtained leave of his father to  travel, and having waited upon Sir Henry Wotton, formerly ambassador  at Venice, and then provost of Eaton College, to whom he communicated  his design, that gentleman wrote a letter to him, dated from the  College, April 18, 1638, and printed among the Reliquiae Wottonianae,  and in Dr. Newton's life of Milton. Immediately after the receipt of  this letter our author set out for France, accompanied only with one  man, who attended him thro' all his travels. At Paris Milton was  introduced to the famous Hugo Grotius, and thence went to Florence,  Siena, Rome, and Naples, in all which places he was entertained with  the utmost civility by persons of the first distinction.    When our author was at Naples he was introduced to the acquaintance of  Giovanni Baptista Manso, Marquis of Villa, a Neapolitan nobleman,  celebrated for his taste in the liberal arts, to whom Tasso addresses  his dialogue on friendship, and whom he likewise mentions in his  Gierusalemme liberata, with great honour. This nobleman shewed  extraordinary civilities to Milton, frequently visited him at his  lodgings, and accompanied him when he went to see the several  curiosities of the city. He was not content with giving our author  these exterior marks of respect only, but he honoured him by a Latin  distich in his praise, which is printed before Milton's Latin poems.  Milton no doubt was highly pleased with such extreme condescension and  esteem from a person of the Marquis of Villa's quality; and as an  evidence of his gratitude, he presented the Marquis at his departure  from Naples, his eclogue, entitled Mansus; which, says Dr. Newton, is  well worth reading among his Latin poems; so that it may be reckoned a  peculiar felicity in the Marquis of Villa's life to have been  celebrated both by Tasso and Milton, the greatest poets of their  nation. Having seen the finest parts of Italy, and conversed with men  of the first distinction, he was preparing to pass over into Sicily  and Greece, when the news from England, that a civil war was like to  lay his country in blood, diverted his purpose; for as by his  education and principles he was attached to the parliamentary  interest, he thought it a mark of abject cowardice, for a lover of his  country to take his pleasure abroad, while the friends of liberty were  contending at home for the rights of human nature. He resolved  therefore to return by way of Rome, tho' he was dissuaded from  pursuing that resolution by the merchants, who were informed by their  correspondents, that the English jesuits there were forming plots  against his life, in case he should return thither, on account of the  great freedom with which he had treated their religion, and the  boldness he discovered in demonstrating the absurdity of the Popish  tenets; for he by no means observed the rule recommended to him by Sir  Henry Wotton, of keeping his thoughts close, and his countenance open.  Milton was removed above dissimulation, he hated whatever had the  appearance of disguise, and being naturally a man of undaunted  courage, he was never afraid to assert his opinions, nor to vindicate  truth tho' violated by the suffrage of the majority.    Stedfast in his resolutions, he went to Rome a second time, and stayed  there two months more, neither concealing his name, nor declining any  disputations to which his antagonists in religious opinions invited  him; he escaped the secret machinations of the jesuits, and came safe  to Florence, where he was received by his friends with as much  tenderness as if he had returned to his own country. Here he remained  two months, as he had done in his former visit, excepting only an  excursion of a few days to Lucca, and then crossing the Appenine, and  passing thro' Bologna, and Ferrara, he arrived at Venice, in which  city he spent a month; and having shipped off the books he had  collected in his travels, he took his course thro' Verona, Milan, and  along the Lake Leman to Geneva. In this city he continued some time,  meeting there with people of his own principles, and contracted an  intimate friendship with Giovanni Deodati, the most learned professor  of Divinity, whose annotations on the bible are published in English;  and from thence returning to France the same way that he had gone  before, he arrived safe in England after an absence of fifteen months,  in which Milton had seen much of the world, read the characters of  famous men, examined the policy of different countries, and made more  extensive improvements than travellers of an inferior genius, and less  penetration, can be supposed to do in double the time. Soon after his  return he took a handsome house in Aldersgate-street, and undertook  the education of his sister's two sons, upon a plan of his own. In  this kind of scholastic solitude he continued some time, but he was  not so much immersed in academical studies, as to stand an indifferent  spectator of what was acted upon the public theatre of his country.  The nation was in great ferment in 1641, and the clamour against  episcopacy running very high, Milton who discovered how much inferior  in eloquence and learning the puritan teachers were to the bishops,  engaged warmly with the former in support of the common cause, and  exercised all the power of which he was capable, in endeavouring to  overthrow the prelatical establishment, and accordingly published five  tracts relating to church government; they were all printed at London  in 4to. The first was intitled, Reformation touching Church Discipline  in England, and the Causes that have hitherto hindered it: two books  written to a friend. The second was of Prelatical Episcopacy, and  whether it may be deducted from Apostolical Times, by virtue of those  Testimonies which are alledged to that purpose in some late treatises;  one whereof goes under the name of James Usher archbishop of Armagh.  The third was the Reason of Church Government urged against the  Prelacy, by Mr. John Milton, in two books. The fourth was  Animadversions upon the Remonstrants Defence against Smectymnuus; and  the fifth an Apology for a Pamphlet called, a Modest Confutation of  the Animadversions upon the Remonstrants against Smectymnuus; or as  the title page is in some copies, an Apology for Smectymnuus, with the  Reason of Church Government, by John Milton.    In the year 1643 Milton married the daughter of Richard Powel, Esq; of  Forrest-hill in Oxfordshire; who not long after obtaining leave of her  husband to pay a visit to her father in the country, but, upon  repeated messages to her, refusing to return, Milton seemed disposed  to marry another, and in 1644 published the Doctrine and Discipline of  Divorce; the Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce, and the year  following his Tetrachordon and Colasterion. Mr. Philips observes, and  would have his readers believe, that the reason of his wife's aversion  to return to him was the contrariety of their state principles. The  lady being educated in loyal notions, possibly imagined, that if ever  the regal power should flourish again, her being connected with a  person so obnoxious to the King, would hurt her father's interest;  this Mr. Philips alledges, but, with submission to his authority, I  dissent from his opinion. Had she been afraid of marrying a man of  Milton's principles, the reason was equally strong before as after  marriage, and her father must have seen it in that light; but the true  reason, or at least a more rational one, seems to be, that she had no  great affection for Milton's person.    Milton was a stern man, and as he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#19)"],[1,"they failed to combat the arguments and exposures of their  critics, they resorted to other tactics, and promulgated voluminous  reports and statements of explanations which left the unfortunate  Volksraad members absolutely stupefied where they had formerly only  been confused.{09}    The following is taken from an article in the Johannesburg _Mining  Journal_, dealing with the burdens imposed by the railway company  upon the industry:    RAILWAY MONOPOLY.    This is another carefully designed burden upon the mines and country.  The issued capital and loans of the Netherlands Company now total  about L7,000,000, upon which an average interest of about 5-1/3 per  cent.--guaranteed by the State--is paid, equal to L370,000 per annum.  Naturally the bonds are at a high premium. The Company and its  liabilities can be taken over by the State at a year's notice, and  the necessary funds for this purpose can be raised at 3 per cent. An  offer was recently made to the Government to consolidate this and  other liabilities, but the National Bank, which is another  concession, has the monopoly of all State loan business, and this  circumstance effectually disposed of the proposal. At 3 per cent. a  saving of L160,000 per annum would be made in this monopoly in  interest alone. The value represented by the Custom dues on the  Portuguese border we are not in a position to estimate, but roughly  these collections and the 15 per cent. of the profits paid to the  management and shareholders must, with other leakages, represent at  least another L100,000 per annum, which should be saved the country.  As the revenue of the corporation now exceeds L2,000,000 a year, of  which only half is expended in working costs, the estimate we have  taken does not err upon the side of extravagance. By its neglect of  its duties towards the commercial and mining community enormous  losses are involved. Thus, in the coal traffic, the rate--which is  now to be somewhat reduced--has been 3d. per ton per mile. According  to the returns of the Chamber of Mines, the coal production of the  Transvaal for 1895 was 1,045,121 tons. This is carried an average  distance of nearly thirty miles, but taking the distance at  twenty-four miles the charges are 6s. per ton. At 1-1/2d. per ton per  mile--three times as much as the Cape railways charge--a saving upon  the coal rates of 3s. per ton would follow, equal to L150,000 per  annum. Again, by the 'bagging' system, an additional cost of 2s. 3d.  per ton is incurred--details of this item have been recently  published in this paper--and if this monopoly were run upon ordinary  business lines, a further saving of L110,000 would be made by  carrying coal in bulk. The interest upon the amount required to  construct the necessary sidings for handling the coal, and the  tram-lines required to transport it to the mines, would be a mere  fraction upon this amount; and as the coal trade in the course of a  short time is likely to see a 50 per cent. increase, the estimate may  be allowed to stand at this figure without deduction. No data are  available to fix the amount of the tax laid upon the people generally  by the vexatious delays and losses following upon inefficient railway  administration, but the monthly meetings of the local Chamber of  Commerce throw some light upon these phases of a monopolistic  management. The savings to be made in dealing with the coal traffic  must not be taken as exhausting all possible reforms; the particulars  given as to this traffic only indicate and suggest the wide area  covered by this monopoly, which hitherto has made but halting and  feeble efforts to keep pace with the requirements of the public.  Dealing as it does with the imports of the whole country, which now  amount in value to L10,000,000, the figures we have given must serve  merely to illustrate its invertebrate methods of handling traffic, as  well as its grasping greed in enforcing the rates fixed by the terms  of its concession. Its forty miles of Rand steam tram-line and  thirty-five miles of railway from the Vaal River, with some little  assistance from the Delagoa line and Customs, brought in a revenue  of about L1,250,000 in 1895. Now that the Natal line is opened the  receipts will probably amount to nearly L3,000,000 per annum, all of  which should swell the ordinary revenue of the country, instead of  remaining in the hands of foreigners as a reservoir of wealth for  indigent Hollanders to exploit. The total railway earnings of the  Cape and Natal together over all their lines amounted to L3,916,566  in 1895, and the capital expenditure on railways by these colonies  amounts to L26,000,000. The greater portion of these receipts come  from the Rand trade, which is compelled to pay an additional  L2,500,000, carrying charges to the Netherlands Company, which has  L7,000,000 of capital. Thus, railway receipts in South Africa amount  now to L7,000,000 per annum, of which the Rand contributes at least  L5,000,000.    The revenue of the company is now considerably over L3,000,000 per  annum. The management claim that their expenses amount to but 40 per  cent. of revenue, and this is regarded by them as a matter for  general congratulation. The Uitlanders contend that the concern is  grossly _mis_managed, and that the low cost of working is a fiction.  It only appears low by contrast with a revenue swollen by  preposterously heavy rates and protected by a monopoly. The tariff  could be reduced by one-half; that is to say, a remission of taxation  to the tune of one and a half million annually could be effected  without depriving the Company of a legitimate and indeed very  handsome profit.    [Selati Railway.]    The Selati Railway Scheme! 'Conceived in iniquity, delivered in  shame, died in disgrace!' might be its history, but for the fact that  it is not quite dead yet. But very nearly! The concession was  obtained during the Session of 1890 by a member of the First  Volksraad, Mr. Barend J. Vorster, jun., who himself took part in and  guided the tone of the debate which decided the granting of the  concession. The Raad resolved to endeavour to obtain the favourable  opinions of their constituents, but before doing so the generous  Mr. Vorster made what he was pleased to call 'presents' to the  members--American spiders, Cape carts, gold watches, shares in the  Company to be floated, and sums in cash--were the trifles by which  Mr. Vorster won his way to favour. He placated the President by  presenting to the Volksraad a portrait of his Honour, executed by the  late Mr. Schroeder, South Africa's one artist. The picture cost L600.  The affair was a notorious and shameless matter of bribery and the  only profit which the country gained from it was a candid confession  of personal principles on the part of Mr. Kruger himself, who when  the exposure took place stated that he saw no harm in members  receiving presents. Debentures to the amount of L500,000 were issued,  bearing Government guarantee of 4 per cent. The Company received L70  for each L100 debenture. Comment is superfluous. A second issue of a  million was made, nominally at L93 10s., but the Company only  received L86--a commission to the brokers or agents of 8-3/4 per  cent., at a time when the Company's previous issue of 4 per cents.  were standing at L97 in the market. The costs of flotation were  charged at upwards of L32,000; the expenses of one gentleman's  travelling, etc., L6,000.    But these are 'trifles light as air.' This Selati Railway Company,  which being guaranteed by Government is really a Government  liability, arranged with a contractor to build the line at the  maximum cost allowed in the concession, L9,600 per mile. Two days  later this contractor sub-let the contract for L7,002 per mile. As  the distance is 200 miles, the Republic was robbed by a stroke of the  pen of L519,600--one of the biggest 'steals' even in the Transvaal.  During the two years for which Dr. Leyds was responsible as the  representative of the Republic for the management of this affair,  none of these peculiar transactions were detected--at any rate none  were reported or exposed; but on the accession to office of an  ignorant old Boer the nest of swindles appears to have been  discovered without any difficulty. And it is generally admitted that  Dr. Leyds is not a fool. This exposure took place at the end of the  Session of 1894, and, inured as the Uitlanders had become to jobs,  this was an eyeopener even for them, and the startled community  tax-payers--who had to bear the brunt of it all.
