Wherever, therefore, there  exists a dramatic literature, it must be pre-eminently entitled to the  attention of the philosopher as well as the philologist, of the man of  general literary tastes as well as the professional scholar.    THE ORIGIN OF DRAMA.    Among the various sorts of literary composition the drama holds the most  important position; for it is a picture of real life, and, as such, of  national interest. It consists of two principal species, tragedy and  comedy; the minor species are tragi-comedy, farce, burlesque and  melo-drama. Both tragedy and comedy attained their perfection in Greece  long before the Christian era. There it originated in the worship of  Bacchus.    The English drama took its rise from the mysteries or sacred plays by  the medium of which the clergy in the Middle Ages endeavoured to impart  a knowledge of the Christian religion.    The Sanskrit drama is said to have been invented by the sage Bharata,  who lived at a very remote period of Indian history and was the author  of a system of music. The earliest references to the acted drama are to  be found in the _Mahabhashya_, which mentions representations of the  _Kansabadha_ and the _Balibadha_, episodes in the history of Krishna.  Indian tradition describes Bharat as having caused to be acted before  the gods a play representing the _Svayamvara_ of Lakshmi.    Tradition further makes Krishna and his cowherdesses the starting point  of the _Sangita_, a representation consisting of a mixture of song,  music, and dancing. The Gitagovinda is concerned with Krishna, and the  modern _Yatras_ generally represent scenes from the life of that deity.    From all this it seems likely that the Hindu drama was developed in  connection with the cult of Vishnu-Krishna; and that the earliest acted  representations were, therefore, like the mysteries of the Christian  Middle Ages, a kind of religious plays, in which scenes from the legends  of the gods were enacted mainly with the aid of songs and dances  supplemented with prose dialogues improvised by the performers. These  earliest forms of Hindu dramatic literature are represented by those  hymns of the _Rig-Veda_ which contain dialogues such as those of Sarama  and the Panis, Yama and Yami, Pururava and Urvaci.    The words for actor (_nata_) and play (_nataka_) are derived from the  verb _nat_, the Prakrit or vernacular form of the Sanskrit _nrit_, \"to  dance.\" Hence scholars are of opinion that the Sanskrit drama has  developed out of dancing. The representations of dramas of early times  were attended with dancing and gesticulation. There were rude  performances without the contrivances of stage and scenic arrangements,  dancing and music forming a considerable part. The addition of dialogue  was the last step in the development, which was thus much the same in  India and Greece. This primitive stage is represented by the Bengal  _Yaeras_ and the Gitagovinda. These form the transition to the fully  developed Sanskrit play in which lyrics and dialogue are blended.    Sakuntala belongs to the mytho-pastoral class of Sanskrit plays;  Probodhchandraudya, to the metaphysical. The Hindu theatre affords  examples of the drama of domestic, as well as of heroic life; of  original invention as well as of legendary tradition.    The Hindus did not borrow their dramatic compositions from foreigners.  The nations of Europe possessed no dramatic literature before the  fourteenth or fifteenth century, at which period the Hindu drama had  passed into its decline. Mohammedan literature has ever been a stranger  to theatrical writings, and the Mussalman conquerors of India could not  have communicated what they never possessed. There is no record that  theatrical entertainments were ever naturalised amongst the ancient  Persians, Arabs, or Egyptians. With the exception of a few features in  common with the Greek and the Chinese dramas, which could not fail to  occur independently, the Hindu dramas present characteristic features in  conduct and construction which strongly evidence both original design  and national development.    Angustus William Von Schlegel observes:--    \"Among the Indians, the people from whom perhaps all the cultivation of  the human race has been derived, plays were known long before they could  have experienced any foreign influence.\"      THE CHARACTER OF THE HINDU DRAMA.    Sanskrit plays are full of lyrical passages describing scenes or persons  presented to view, or containing reflections suggested by the incidents  that occur. They usually consist of four-line stanzas. The prose of the  dialogue in the plays is often very commonplace, serving only as an  introduction to the lofty sentiment of the poetry that follows.    The Sanskrit drama is a mixed composition in which joy is mingled with  sorrow, in which the jester usually plays a prominent part, while the  hero and heroine are often in the depths of despair. But it never has a  sad ending. The emotions of terror, grief, or pity, with which the  audience are inspired, are therefore always tranquillised by the happy  termination of the story. Nor may any deeply tragic incident take place  in the course of the play; for death is never allowed to be represented  on the stage. Indeed, nothing considered indecorous, whether of a  serious or comic character, is allowed to be enacted in the sight or  hearing of the spectators, such as the utterance of a curse,  degradation, banishment, national calamity, biting, scratching, kissing,  eating, or sleeping.    Love, according to Hindu notions, is the subject of most of their  dramas. The hero, who is generally a king, and already the husband of a  wife or wives, is suddenly smitten with the charms of a lovely woman,  sometimes a nymph, or, as in the case of Sakuntala, the daughter of a  nymph by a mortal father. The heroine is required to be equally  impressible, and the first tender glance from the hero's eye reaches her  heart. With true feminine delicacy, however, she locks the secret of her  passion in her own breast, and by her coyness and reserve keeps her  lover for a long period in the agonies of suspense. The hero, being  reduced to a proper state of desperation, is harassed by other  difficulties. Either the celestial nature of the nymph is in the way of  their union, or he doubts the legality of the match, or he fears his own  unworthiness, or he is hampered by the angry jealousy of a previous  wife. In short, doubts, obstacles and delays make great havoc of both  hero and heroine. They give way to melancholy, indulge in amorous  rhapsodies, and become very emaciated. So far the story is decidedly  dull, and its pathos, notwithstanding the occasional grandeur and beauty  of imagery, often verges on the ridiculous. But, by way of relief, an  element of life is generally introduced in the character of the  Vidushaka, or Jester, who is the constant companion of the hero; and in  the young maidens, who are confidential friends of the heroine, and soon  become possessed of her secret. By a curious regulation, the jester is  always a Brahman, and, therefore, of a caste superior to the king  himself; yet his business is to excite mirth by being ridiculous in  person, age, and attire. He is represented as grey-haired, hump-backed,  lame and hideously ugly. In fact, he is a species of buffoon, who is  allowed full liberty of speech, being himself a universal butt. His  attempts at wit, which are rarely very successful, and his allusions to  the pleasures of the table, of which he is a confessed votary, are  absurdly contrasted with the sententious solemnity of the despairing  hero, crossed in the prosecution of his love-suit. His clumsy  interference with the intrigues of his friend, only serves to augment  his difficulties, and occasions many an awkward dilemma. On the other  hand, the shrewdness of the heroine's confidantes never seem to fail  them under the most trying circumstances; while their sly jokes and  innuendos, their love of fun, their girlish sympathy with the progress  of the love-affair, their warm affection for their friend, heighten the  interest of the plot, and contribute not a little to vary its monotony.    Indeed, if a calamitous conclusion be necessary to constitute a tragedy,  the Hindu dramas are never tragedies. They are mixed compositions, in  which joy and sorrow, happiness and misery, are woven in a mingled  web,--tragi-comic representations, in which good and evil, right and  wrong, truth and falsehood, are allowed to mingle in confusion during  the first acts of the drama. But, in the last act, harmony is always  restored, order succeeds to disorder, tranquillity to agitation; and the  mind of the spectator, no longer perplexed by the apparent ascendancy of  evil, is soothed, and purified, and made to acquiesce in the moral  lesson deducible from the plot.    In comparison with the Greek and the modern drama, Nature occupies a  much more important place in Sanskrit plays. The characters are  surrounded by Nature, with which they are in constant communion. The  mango and other trees, creepers, lotuses, and pale-red trumpet-flowers,  gazelles, flamingoes, bright-hued parrots, and Indian cuckoos, in the  midst of which they move, are often addressed by them and form an  essential part of their lives. Hence the influence of Nature on the  minds of lovers is much dwelt on. Prominent everywhere in classical  Sanskrit poetry, these elements of Nature luxuriate most of all in the  drama.    The dramas of Bhavabhuti except Malati-Madhava, and the whole herd of  the later dramatic authors, relate to the heroic traditions of the  Ramayana and the Mahabharata, or else to the history of Krishna; and the  later the pieces are, the more do they resemble the so-called  'mysteries' of the middle ages.

I told you the other day that our wardrobe for every-day  wear was spun, woven, and made by mother, and it is not to be expected  that home-made coats and trousers should have the cut of a fashionable  New York tailor; but they were, at all events, warm and comfortable.  That brother's trousers were always short, and especially in one leg,  is an absurd fabrication.  The story may perhaps have risen from some  one who remembers his lameness in Poultney, when he acquired the habit  of dragging one leg a little after the other, and that style of walking  may have apparently shortened one of the trouser legs.  Have you  anything else to ask, little one?\"    \"Yes, auntie,\" said Gabrielle, smiling at mamma's methodical way of  answering: \"was papa an awkward boy, and did he eat vulgarly?\"    \"I have told you, dear,\" mamma replied, \"how we were brought up.  I  never saw your papa eat ravenously while he was at home; for father was  a despot at table, and any appearance of gluttony would have been  quickly checked by the dreaded descent of his fork upon the table.  I  think it probable that later in life, when your papa became a  distinguished man, and every moment was of value, that he did eat  quicker than was consistent with the laws of etiquette, but not when he  was a boy.    \"As for his awkwardness, I can readily imagine that a boy so intensely  preoccupied would not appear in so favorable a light to strangers as  one who should seek the society of people rather than books, and a  superficial observer might have mistaken his air of abstraction for  rustic bashfulness.  You know that he was always absorbed in a book  from the time he was three years old.  Father would often send him to  do an errand--to fetch wood or the like; he would start very  obediently, but with his eyes upon his book, and by the time he had  reached the door he would have completely forgotten everything outside  the page he was reading, and it was necessary to send some one after  him to remind him of his errand.  He certainly was very unlike  every-day boys, not only in appearance, but in habits and moral  qualities.  Never did I hear a coarse or profane word pass his lips;  the purity of his soul was radiant in his beautiful modest countenance;  while his slender, boyish figure, with the ponderous white head poised  upon his long, slim neck, always reminded me of a lovely, swaying lily.\"    \"I have seen recently in some book,\" said Marguerite, \"that uncle was  never at his ease in polite society.  This I think very absurd.  To be  sure he had not the manners of a dancing-master, but--\"    \"Yes,\" interrupted mamma; \"this statement is another of the usual  exaggerations current about brother.  As you say, he had not the  manners of a dancing-master, and when importuned and annoyed by shallow  people, may often have been abrupt with them; but when in society, I  have always seen his company as much or more courted than that of any  other person present, and have never known him to shrink or be  embarrassed in the presence of people of distinction or rank.  Few men  have, I think, been more misrepresented, though often with the kindest  intentions, than my dear brother.\"    \"You spoke of papa's lameness while at Poultney, Aunt Esther,\" said  Ida, looking up from a letter that she was reading; \"pray how did he  become lame?  Was it serious?  I do not remember hearing him mention  it.\"    \"It occurred, I believe, in this way,\" said mamma.  \"Whilst your papa  was in the _Spectator_ office, he chanced one day to step upon a rough  box, which turned over, and hitting him upon the leg, inflicted a cut  below his knee.  At first, brother thought it a mere scratch not worth  noticing; but when he subsequently took cold in it, he found it very  troublesome, and although he then consulted several medical men, they  were unable to cure it, I do not remember hearing that he was ever  confined to the house with it--probably because he could not afford to  give up his work long enough to have it properly treated; but for two  or perhaps three years he limped to and from the office.  When he went  subsequently to Erie, Pennsylvania, to work as a journeyman printer,  the wound, which had partially healed, had again opened, and was very  painful.  Some old woman residing there, however, gave him a simple  remedy which soon cured it permanently.\"    \"From whom is the letter that you are reading, Ida?\" inquired  Gabrielle, putting up her father's biography in a bookcase; \"does it  contain a request for a loan of $500, or is it an offer of a home in a  Christian family?\"    \"Neither, for once,\" answered Ida.  \"It is from _The Tribune_ office,  and contains a slip cut from the Omaha _Bee_, headed, 'Horace Greeley  upon Girls.'  It appears that a lady, Miss Hewes, who did not know papa  personally, wrote to him to ask if he recollected his first  school-house, and a former playmate of his, named Reuben Nichols, whose  acquaintance Miss Hewes had just made.  Here is papa's answer, dated  Washington, 1856.  Let me read it to you, Aunt Esther, and tell me if  you think it is genuine.\"      \"'MISS HEWES:--As I do not know you, and am little interested in any  but a part of your letter, you will allow me, in my terrible  hurry--having two days' work that ought to be done to-day, while I must  leave at evening for a journey to our Pittsburg Convention--to speak  only of that.    \"'I very well remember the red school-house in which I first began to  learn (the paint was worn off long since, and it was very far from red  when I last saw it); I remember the Nichols children, who lived, just  below the school-house, in a large house.  But I was very young then,  and I do not make out a clear mental picture of Reuben Nichols.  I  think he must have been considerably older than I.  But I recollect one  Aseneth Nichols, one of two girls not much older than I, whom I thought  very pretty, so that while I was a very good speller, and so one of the  two at the head of the first class in spelling, who were entitled to  \"choose sides\" for a spelling match; I used to begin by choosing these  two pretty girls who couldn't spell hokee to save their souls.  Well,  this was found not to answer; I knew enough to spell but not to choose  sides; so the _role_ had to be altered, and the two next to the one at  the head had the honor of \"choosing sides.\"  Ask Mr. Nichols if he had  a sister Aseneth, and if he remembers any such nonsense as this.  My  kind regards to him.    \"'Yours,    \"'HORACE GREELEY.'\"      \"I don't believe,\" said Gabrielle, \"that papa ever wrote that letter.\"    \"It does not sound much like him,\" rejoined Marguerite, \"with the  exception of 'Yours, Horace Greeley'; what do you think, mamma?\"    \"The letter is characteristic,\" was mamma's reply; \"the style is his,  but there are several words that I have never known him to use;  however, they may have been illegible in the original, and their place  supplied by the printer's ingenuity.  I remember hearing father and  mother often speak of Reuben Nichols who lived near grandfather in  Londonderry, and I believe that he had a son named Reuben, and a  daughter named Aseneth, so the letter must be genuine, I suppose.\"    \"Was it true, mamma?\" inquired Marguerite, \"that uncle was fond of  little girls?  You know it has been said of him that he was as a man  quite indifferent to women.\"    \"Yes, he was very partial to little girls,\" was mamma's reply, \"when  they were pretty and gentle.  Not, however, in the love-making way of  the present precocious generation, but he liked to talk to them, and  relate stories from the books he had read.  Perhaps the secret of his  preference lay in the fact that they made more attentive and  sympathetic listeners than his rough boy-friends.    \"I told you the other day that at the ball he attended when thirteen  years old, he was the escort of Anne Bush, the prettiest girl in the  village.  She was perhaps a year younger than he, and as I remember  her, extremely pretty--a slender figure, cheeks like roses, blue eyes,  dark hair, and very gentle, ladylike ways.  She had a sister Sophie,  who was as plain as Anne was pretty; and a wild, mischievous girl, but  my inseparable and dearest companion.    \"There were two other girls of whom brother was very fond at that time;  Cornelia Anne Smith and Rebecca Fish.  Cornelia Anne was older than the  other girls, about fourteen, I think, and was the fondest of learning  of the trio.  I remember that she often used to bring her school-books  to brother when some difficulty had arisen in her lessons, and he would  explain the hard points.  I think that he always corresponded with  these girls, and visited them occasionally after they became women, for  you know with what tenacity he clung to his early associations.  He has  often spoken to me of Rebecca Fish, who is now Mrs. Whipple, of  Fairhaven.    \"You would be amused if I were to tell you how he used to pass the time  that he spent with these three girls.  A city-bred boy of thirteen or  fourteen would have been quite capable of arranging an elopement with  the prettiest one, but brother's style of courtship was quite unique;  he used to correct their grammar when they conversed, and gravely  lecture them upon the folly of wearing stays!    \"The corsets which so aroused his ire were quite different from those  of the present day.  At that time, you must know, the Empire dress,  that you have seen in portraits of the time of the first Napoleon, was  all the fashion; no crinoline, skirts so extremely scant and gored that  they clung to the figure like drapery upon a statue, and waists a  finger and a half in depth, with inch-wide bands instead of sleeves.  This style of dress was very graceful and becoming when worn by a woman  of slender figure, and those who were not thus favored by Nature made  the best of their figures by wearing what was then called 'busks,' or "]]]
