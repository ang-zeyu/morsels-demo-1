I didn't know how badly until I got here.\"    \"You should not want to see me at all. People will talk.\"    \"So you care what people say of you?\" he questioned, feigning  surprise.    \"Of me? No. I was thinking of you.\"    \"You fear the poison tongues for me? Well, they cannot harm me. I'm  beyond tongues or minds like those.\"    She regarded him earnestly, with serious gravity and slowly dawning  apprehension; then, turning to arrange the violets in a tiny vase, she  shook her head.    \"Daren, you're beyond me, too. I feel a--a change in you. Have you had  another sick spell?\"    \"Only for a day off and on. I'm really pretty well to-day. But I have  changed. I feel that, yet I don't know how.\"    Lane could talk to her. She stirred him, drew him out of himself. He  felt a strange desire for her sympathy, and a keen curiosity  concerning her opinions.    \"I thought maybe you'd been ill again or perhaps upset by the  consequences of your--your action at Fanchon Smith's party.\"    \"Who told you of that?\" he asked in surprise.    \"Dal. She was here yesterday. She will come in spite of me.\"    \"So will I,\" interposed Lane.    She shook her head. \"No, it's different for a man.... I've missed the  girls. No one but Dal ever comes. I thought Margie would be true to  me--no matter what had befallen.... Dal comes, and oh, Daren, she is  good. She helps me so.... She told me what you did at Fanchon's  party.\"    \"She did! Well, what's your verdict?\" he queried, grimly. \"That break  queered me in Middleville.\"    \"I agree with what Doctor Wallace said to his congregation,\" returned  Mel.    As Lane met the blue fire of her eyes he experienced another  singularly deep and profound thrill, as if the very depths of him had  been stirred. He seemed to have suddenly discovered Mel Iden.    \"Doctor Wallace did back me up,\" said Lane, with a smile. \"But no one  else did.\"    \"Don't be so sure of that. Harsh conditions require harsh measures.  Dal said you killed the camel-walk dance in Middleville.\"    \"It surely was a disgusting sight,\" returned Lane, with a grimace.  \"Mel, I just saw red that night.\"    \"Daren,\" she asked wistfully, following her own train of thought, \"do  you know that most of the girls consider me an outcast? Fanchon rides  past me with her head up in the air. Helen Wrapp cuts me. Margie looks  to see if her mother is watching when she bows to me. Isn't it  strange, Daren, how things turn out? Maybe my old friends are right.  But I don't _feel_ that I am what they think I am.... I would do what  I did--over and over.\"    Her eyes darkened under his gaze, and a slow crimson tide stained her  white face.    \"I understand you, Mel,\" he said, swiftly. \"You must forgive me that I  didn't understand at once.... And I think you are infinitely better,  finer, purer than these selfsame girls who scorn you.\"    \"Daren! You--understand?\" she faltered.    And just as swiftly he told her the revelation that thinking had  brought to him.    When he had finished she looked at him for a long while. \"Yes, Daren,\"  she finally said, \"you understand, and you have made me understand. I  always felt\"--and her hand went to her heart--\"but my mind did not  grasp.... Oh, Daren, how I thank you!\" and she held her hands out to  him.    Lane grasped the outstretched hands, and loosed the leaping thought  her words and action created.    \"Mel, let me give your boy a father--a name.\"    No blow could have made her shrink so palpably. It passed--that shame.  Her lips parted, and other emotions claimed her.    \"Daren--you would--marry me?\" she gasped.    \"I am asking you to be my wife for your child's sake,\" he replied.    Her head bowed. She sank against him, trembling. Her hands clung  tightly to his. Lane divined something of her agitation from the feel  of her slender form. And then again that deep and profound thrill ran  over him. It was followed by an instinct to wrap her in his arms, to  hold her, to share her trouble and to protect her.    Strong reserve force suddenly came to Mel. She drew away from Lane,  still quivering, but composed.    \"Daren, all my life I'll thank you and bless you for that offer,\" she  said, very low. \"But, of course it is impossible.\"    She disengaged her hands, and, turning away, looked out of the window.  Lane rather weakly sat down. What had come over him? His blood seemed  bursting in his veins. Then he gazed round the dingy little parlor and  at this girl of twenty, whose beauty did not harmonize with her  surroundings. Fair-haired, white-faced, violet-eyed, she emanated  tragedy. He watched her profile, clear cut as a cameo, fine brow,  straight nose, sensitive lips, strong chin. She was biting those  tremulous lips. And when she turned again to him they were red. The  short-bowed upper lip, full and sweet, the lower, with its sensitive  droop at the corner, eloquent of sorrow--all at once Lane realized he  wanted to kiss that mouth more than he had ever wanted anything. The  moment was sudden and terrible, for it meant love--love such as he had  never known.    \"Daren,\" she said, turning, \"tell me how you got the _Croix de  Guerre_.\"    By the look of her and the hand that moved toward his breast, Lane  felt his power over her. He began his story and it was as if he heard  some one else talking. When he had finished, she asked, \"The French  Army honored you, why not the American?\"    \"It was never reported.\"    \"How strange! Who was your officer?\"    \"You'll laugh when you hear,\" he replied, without hint of laugh  himself. \"Heavens, how things come about! My officer was from  Middleville.\"    \"Daren! Who?\" she asked, quickly, her eyes darkening with thought.    \"Captain Vane Thesel.\"    How singular to Lane the fact she did not laugh! She only stared. Then  it seemed part of her warmth and glow, her subtle response to his  emotion, slowly receded. He felt what he could not see.    \"Oh! He. Vane Thesel,\" she said, without wonder or surprise or  displeasure, or any expression Lane anticipated.    Her strange detachment stirred a hideous thought--could Thesel have  been.... But Lane killed the culmination of that thought. Not,  however, before dark, fiery jealousy touched him with fangs new to his  endurance.    To drive it away, Lane launched into more narrative of the war. And as  he talked he gradually forgot himself. It might be hateful to rake up  the burning threads of memory for the curious and the soulless, but to  tell Mel Iden it was a keen, strange delight. He watched the changes  of her expression. He learned to bring out the horror, sadness, glory  that abided in her heart. And at last he cut himself off abruptly:  \"But I must save something for another day.\"    That broke the spell.    \"No, you must never come back.\"    He picked up his hat and his stick.    \"Mel, would you shut the door in my face?\"    \"No, Daren--but I'll not open it,\" she replied resolutely.    \"Why?\"    \"You must not come.\"    \"For my sake--or yours?\"    \"Both our sakes.\"    He backed out on the little porch, and looked at her as she stood  there. Beyond him, indeed, were his emotions then. Sad as she seemed,  he wanted to make her suffer more--an inexplicable and shameful  desire.    \"Mel, you and I are alike,\" he said.    \"Oh, no, Daren; you are noble and I am....\"    \"Mel, in my dreams I see myself standing--plodding along the dark  shores of a river--that river of tears which runs down the vast naked  stretch of our inner lives.... I see you now, on the opposite shore.  Let us reach our hands across--for the baby's sake.\"    \"Daren, it is a beautiful thought, but it--it can't be,\" she  whispered.    \"Then let me come to see you when I need--when I'm down,\" he begged.    \"No.\"    \"Mel, what harm can it do--just to let me come?\"    \"No--don't ask me. Daren, I am no stone.\"    \"You'll be sorry when I'm out there in--Woodlawn.... That won't be  long.\"    That broke her courage and her restraint.    \"Come, then,\" she whispered, in tears.          CHAPTER VIII      Lane's intentions and his spirit were too great for his endurance. It  was some time before he got downtown again. And upon entering the inn  he was told some one had just called him on the telephone.    \"Hello, this is Lane,\" he answered. \"Who called me?\"    \"It's Blair,\" came the reply. \"How are you, old top?\"    \"Not so well. I've been down and out.\"    \"Sorry. Suppose that's why you haven't called me up for so long?\"    \"Well, Buddy, I can't lay it all to that.... And how're you?\"    The answer did not come. So Lane repeated his query.    \"Well, I'm still hobbling round on one leg,\" replied Blair.    \"That's good. Tell me about Reddie.\"    Again the reply was long in coming....    \"Haven't you heard--about Red?\"    \"No.\"    \"Haven't seen the newspapers lately?\"    \"I never read the papers, Blair.\"    \"Right-o. But I had to.... Buck up, now, Dare!\"    \"All right. Shoot it quick,\" returned Lane, feeling his breast  contract and his skin tighten with a chill.    \"Red Payson has gone west.\"    \"Blair! You don't mean--dead?\" exclaimed Lane.    \"Yes, Reddie's gone--and I guess it's just as well, poor devil!\"    \"How? When?\"    \"Two days ago, according to papers.... He died in Washington, D.C.  Fell down in the vestibule of one of the government offices--where he  was waiting.... fell with another hemorrhage--and died right there--on  the floor--quick.\"    \"My--God!\" gasped Lane.    \"Yes, it's tough. You see, Dare, I couldn't keep Reddie here. Heaven  knows I tried, but he wouldn't stay.... I'm afraid he heard my mother  complaining. Say, Dare, suppose I have somebody drive me in town to  see you.\"    \"I'd like that, Blair.\"    \"You're on. And say, I've another idea. To-night's the Junior Prom--did  you know that?\"    \"No, I didn't.\"    \"Well, it is. Suppose we go up? My sister can get me cards.... I tell  you, Dare, I'd like to see what's going on in that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#19)"],[1,"itted) and told my officers  so: but I would not attempt it at this time because we wanted water and  could not depend upon finding it there. This place is in the latitude of  20 degrees 21 minutes, but in the chart that I had of this coast, which  was Tasman's, it was laid down in 19 degrees 50 minutes, and the shore is  laid down as all along joining in one body or continent, with some  openings appearing like rivers; and not like islands, as really they are.  See several sights of it, Table 4 Numbers 8, 9, and 10. This place lies  more northerly by 40 minutes than is laid down in Mr. Tasman's chart: and  beside its being made a firm, continued land, only with some openings  like the mouths of rivers, I found the soundings also different from what  the pricked line of his course shows them, and generally shallower than  he makes them; which inclines me to think that he came not so near the  shore as his line shows, and so had deeper soundings, and could not so  well distinguish the islands. His meridian or difference of longitude  from Shark's Bay agrees well enough with my account, which is 232  leagues, though we differ in latitude. And to confirm my conjecture that  the line of his course is made too near the shore, at least not far to  the east of this place, the water is there so shallow that he could not  come there so nigh.    HE ANCHORS ON A THIRD PART OF NEW HOLLAND, AND DIGS WELLS, BUT BRACKISH.    But to proceed: in the night we had a small land-breeze, and in the  morning I weighed anchor, designing to run in among the islands, for they  had large channels between them, of a league wide at least, and some 2 or  3 leagues wide. I sent in my boat before to sound, and if they found  shoal water to return again; but if they found water enough to go ashore  on one of the islands and stay till the ship came in: where they might in  the meantime search for water. So we followed after with the ship,  sounding as we went in, and had 20 fathom, till within 2 leagues of the  bluff head, and then we had shoal water, and very uncertain soundings:  yet we ran in still with an easy sail, sounding and looking out well, for  this was dangerous work. When we came abreast of the bluff head, and  about 2 mile from it, we had but 7 fathom: then we edged away from it,  but had no more water; and, running in a little farther, we had but 4  fathoms; so we anchored immediately; and yet when we had veered out a  third of a cable we had 7 fathom water again; so uncertain was the water.  My boat came immediately aboard, and told me that the island was very  rocky and dry, and they had little hopes of finding water there. I sent  them to sound, and bade them, if they found a channel of 8 or 10 fathom  water to keep on, and we would follow with the ship. We were now about 4  leagues within the outer small rocky islands, but still could see nothing  but islands within us; some 5 or 6 leagues long, others not above a mile  round. The large islands were pretty high; but all appeared dry and  mostly rocky and barren. The rocks looked of a rusty yellow colour, and  therefore I despaired of getting water on any of them; but was in some  hopes of finding a channel to run in beyond all these islands, could I  have spent time here, and either get to the main of New Holland, or find  out some other islands that might afford us water and other refreshments;  besides, that among so many islands we might have found some sort of rich  mineral or ambergris, it being a good latitude for both these. But we had  not sailed above a league farther before our water grew shoaler again,  and then we anchored in 6 fathom hard sand.    We were now on the inner side of the island, on whose outside is the  bluff point. We rode a league from the island and I presently went  ashore, and carried shovels to dig for water, but found none. There grow  here 2 or three sorts of shrubs, one just like rosemary; and therefore I  called this Rosemary Island. It grew in great plenty here, but had no  smell. Some of the other shrubs had blue and yellow flowers; and we found  2 sorts of grain like beans: the one grew on bushes; the other on a sort  of creeping vine that runs along on the ground, having very thick broad  leaves and the blossom like a bean blossom, but much larger, and of a  deep red colour, looking very beautiful. We saw here some cormorants,  gulls, crab-catchers, etc., a few small land-birds, and a sort of white  parrot, which flew a great many together. We found some shellfish, namely  limpets, periwinkles, and abundance of small oysters, growing on the  rocks, which were very sweet. In the sea we saw some green-turtle, a  pretty many sharks, and abundance of water-snakes of several sorts and  sizes. The stones were all of rusty colour, and ponderous.    We saw a smoke on an island 3 or 4 leagues off; and here also the bushes  had been burned, but we found no other sign of inhabitants: it was  probable that on the island where the smoke was there were inhabitants,  and fresh water for them. In the evening I went aboard, and consulted  with my officers whether it was best to send thither, or to search among  any other of these islands with my boat; or else go from hence, and coast  alongshore with the ship till we could find some better place than this  was to ride in, where we had shoal water and lay exposed to winds and  tides. They all agreed to go from hence; so I gave orders to weigh in the  morning as soon as it should be light, and to get out with the  land-breeze.    According, August the 23rd, at 5 in the morning we ran out, having a  pretty fresh land-breeze at south-south-east. By 8 o'clock we were got  out, and very seasonably; for before 9 the seabreeze came on us very  strong, and increasing, we took in our topsails and stood off under 2  courses and a mizzen, this being as much sail as we could carry. The sky  was clear, there being not one cloud to be seen; but the horizon appeared  very hazy, and the sun at setting the night before, and this morning at  rising, appeared very red. The wind continued very strong till 12, then  it began to abate: I have seldom met with a stronger breeze. These strong  seabreezes lasted thus in their turns 3 or 4 days. They sprang up with  the sunrise; by 9 o'clock they were very strong, and so continued till  noon, when they began to abate; and by sunset there was little wind, or a  calm till the land-breezes came; which we should certainly have in the  morning about 1 or 2 o'clock. The land-breezes were between the  south-south-west and south-south-east. The seabreezes between the  east-north-east and north-north-east. In the night while calm we fished  with hook and line and caught good store of fish, namely, snapper, bream,  old-wives, and dogfish. When these last came we seldom caught any others;  for if they did not drive away the other fish, yet they would be sure to  keep them from taking our hooks, for they would first have them  themselves, biting very greedily. We caught also a monkfish, of which I  brought home the picture. See Fish Figure 1.    On the 25th of August we still coasted alongshore, that we might the  better see any opening; kept sounding, and had about 20 fathom clean  sand. The 26th day, being about 4 leagues offshore, the water began  gradually to shoal from 20 to 14 fathom. I was edging in a little towards  the land, thinking to have anchored; but presently after the water  decreased almost at once, till we had but 5 fathom. I durst therefore  adventure no farther, but steered out the same way that we came in; and  in a short time had 10 fathom (being then about 4 leagues and a half from  the shore) and even soundings. I steered away east-north-east coasting  along as the land lies. This day the seabreezes began to be very moderate  again, and we made the best of our way alongshore, only in the night  edging off a little for fear of shoals. Ever since we left Shark's Bay we  had fair clear weather, and so for a great while still.    The 27th day we had 20 fathom water all night, yet we could not see land  till 1 in the afternoon from our topmast-head. By 3 we could just discern  land from our quarter-deck; we had then 16 fathom. The wind was at north  and we steered east by north, which is but one point in on the land; yet  we decreased our water very fast; for at 4 we had but 9 fathom; the next  cast but 7, which frighted us; and we then tacked instantly and stood  off: but in a short time the wind coming at north-west and  west-north-west we tacked again, and steered north-north-east and then  deepened our water again, and had all night from 15 to 20 fathom.    The 28th day we had between 20 and 40 fathom. We saw no land this day but  saw a great many snakes and some whales. We saw also some boobies and  noddy-birds; and in the night caught one of these last. It was of another  shape and colour than any I had seen before. It had a small long bill, as  all of them have, flat feet like ducks' feet; its tail forked like a  swallow, but longer and broader, and the fork deeper than that of the  swallow, with very long wings; the top or crown of the head of this noddy  was coal-black, having also small black streaks round about and close to  the eyes; and round these streaks on each side a pretty broad white  circle. The breast, belly, and underpart of the wings of this noddy were  white; and the back and upper part of its wings of a faint black or smoke  colour. See a picture of this and of the common one, Birds Figures 5 and  6. Noddies are seen in most places between the tropics, as well in the  East Indies, and on the coast of Brazil, as in the West Indies. They rest  ashore a-nights, and therefore we never see them far at sea, not above 20  or 30 leagues, unless driven off in a storm. When they come about a ship  they commonly perch in the night, and will sit still till they are taken  by the seamen. They build on cliffs against the sea, or rocks, as I have  said.    OF"]]]
