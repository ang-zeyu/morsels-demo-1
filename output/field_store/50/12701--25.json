Goats have been taught to perform a great many wonderful exploits. The  celebrated traveler, Dr. Clarke, gives a very curious account of a goat  which he came across in Arabia. This goat would perform some most  surprising feats of dexterity. \"We met,\" he says, \"an Arab with a goat,  which he led about the country to exhibit, in order to gain a  livelihood. He had taught this animal, while he accompanied its  movements with a song, to mount upon little cylindrical blocks of wood,  placed successively one above another, and resembling in shape the dice  belonging to a backgammon table. In this manner the goat stood, first on  the top of two; afterward of three, four, five, and six, until it  remained balanced upon the summit of them all, elevated several feet  above the ground, and with its fore feet collected upon a single point,  without throwing down the disjointed fabric on which it stood. The  diameter of the upper cylinder, on which its four feet alternately  remained until the Arab had ended his ditty, was only two inches, and  the length of each was six inches. The most curious part of the  performance took place afterward; for the Arab, to convince us of the  animal's attention to the turn of the air, sometimes interrupted the  ordinary _da capo_, or repeat, and as often as he did so, the goat  tottered, and appeared uneasy. When the man suddenly stopped, in the  middle of his song, the animal fell to the ground.\"    [Illustration: THE WONDERFUL FEAT OF THE GOAT.]    A farmer in Scotland missed one of his goats, when his flock came home  at night. Being afraid the missing animal would get among the young  trees in his nursery, he sent two boys, wrapped up warm in their plaid  cloaks, to watch all night. In the morning, these boys climbed up the  brow of a hill near by, to hunt for the wanderer. They found her after a  long search. She was on the brow of a hill, and her young kid was by her  side. This faithful mother was defending the kid from the attack of a  fox. The enemy was using all the cunning and art he was master of, to  get possession of the little fellow, while the old goat was presenting  her horns in every direction, as he made his sallies. The boys shouted  at the top of their voices, in order to drive the fox away. But Master  Renard was probably aware that they would not dare to touch him. At any  rate, he kept up the assault. At last, getting out of patience with the  goat, he made a more resolute effort to seize the kid; and in an instant  all three of the animals rolled off the precipice, and were killed by  the fall. The fox was found at the bottom of the gorge, with the goat's  horns piercing his body.    A story is told by Mr. Bingley, which illustrates, in a very forcible  manner, the gratitude and affection of the goat. After the final  suppression of the Scottish rebellion of 1715, by the decisive battle of  Preston, a gentleman who had taken a very active share in it escaped to  the West Highlands, to the residence of a female relative, who afforded  him an asylum. As, in consequence of the strict search which was made  after the ringleaders, it was soon judged unsafe for him to remain in  the house of his friend, he was conducted to a cavern in a sequestered  situation, and furnished with a supply of food. The approach to this  lonely abode consisted of a small aperture, through which he crept,  dragging his provisions along with him. A little way from the mouth of  the cave the roof became elevated, but on advancing, an obstacle  obstructed his progress. He soon perceived that, whatever it might be,  the object was a living one; but unwilling to strike at a venture with  his dirk, he stooped down, and discovered a goat and her kid lying on  the ground. The animal was evidently in great pain, and feeling her body  and limbs, he ascertained that one of her legs had been fractured. He  bound it up with his garter, and offered her some of his bread; but she  refused to eat, and stretched out her tongue, as if intimating that her  mouth was parched with thirst. He gave her water, which she drank  greedily, and then she ate the bread. At midnight he ventured from the  cave, pulled a quantity of grass and the tender branches of trees, and  carried them to the poor sufferer, which received them with  demonstrations of gratitude. The only thing which this fugitive had to  arrest his attention in this dreary abode, was administering comfort to  the goat; and he was, indeed, thankful to have any living creature  beside him. She quickly recovered, and became tenderly attached to him.  It happened that the servant who was intrusted with the secret of his  retreat fell sick, when it became necessary to send another with  provisions. The goat, on this occasion, happening to be lying near the  mouth of the cavern, opposed his entrance with all her might, butting  him furiously; the fugitive, hearing a disturbance, went forward, and  receiving the watchword from his new attendant, interposed, and the  faithful goat permitted him to pass. So resolute was the animal on this  occasion, that the gentleman was convinced she would have died in his  defence.    [Illustration: CHAPTER END DECORATION]          The Tiger.      Such of my readers as have had an opportunity to look a little into  natural history, are probably aware that the tiger belongs to the cat  family. Many of its habits are very like those of the domestic cat. Did  you ever see an old cat preparing to make a spring at a mouse or a bird?  If you have, you have noticed that she crouches on the ground, and  creeps stealthily along toward her victim, without making the least  noise, until she is near enough, and then suddenly springs upon her  prey. The tiger pursues the same course.    A British officer, who lived for awhile in India, where tigers abound,  was returning, in the evening, to the house where he resided, after  dining with another officer, when he was met by his servants, who were  making a great noise, in order to frighten away a tiger which was known  to be prowling about the neighborhood. Although he had been some years  in India, the young officer had never seen a tiger, as it happened,  except from a distance; and he determined he would gratify his  curiosity, if possible, and have a good view of the animal. So he  dismissed his servants, and seated himself opposite the jungle, where  the tiger was supposed to be, and there looked out for the enemy. It was  moonlight, and the ferocious beast soon discovered the officer. The  latter could distinctly see all the motions of his savage foe. He  approached so slowly as scarcely to make the least noise. Then,  crouching down, he prepared to make the fatal spring at his victim. At  this instant, however, the officer, taking off a bear skin cap which he  wore, swung it in the air, and shouted as loudly as he could. This so  frightened the tiger that he made off with himself, and was soon out of  sight in the bushes.    A European gentleman, who has spent some time in Java, tells us a  thrilling story about the adventure of a criminal with a tiger. The poor  man was condemned, as is the custom in that country, to fight a large  royal tiger, whose ferocity was raised to the highest point by want of  food and artificial irritation. The only weapon allowed to the human  combatant was a lance, with the point broken off. After wrapping a cloth  round his left fist and arm, the man entered the arena with an air of  undaunted calmness, and fixed a steady, menacing gaze upon the brute.  The tiger sprang furiously upon his intended victim, who, with  extraordinary boldness and rapidity, thrust his left fist into the  gaping jaws, and at the same moment, with his keen, pointless dagger,  ripped up the breast to the very heart. In less than a minute the tiger  lay dead at his conqueror's feet. The criminal was forgiven.    [Illustration: THE TIGER.]    Several years ago, an Englishman, by the name of Munro, was killed by a  tiger in the East Indies. The particulars of this distressing scene are  given by an eye-witness. \"We went on shore,\" says the writer of the  narrative, \"to shoot deer, of which we saw innumerable tracks, as well  as of tigers; notwithstanding which, we continued our diversion till  near three o'clock, when, sitting down by the side of a jungle to  refresh ourselves, a roar like thunder was heard, and an immense tiger  seized on our unfortunate friend, and rushed again into the jungle,  dragging him through the thickest bushes and trees, every thing giving  way to his monstrous strength; a tigress accompanied his progress. The  united agonies of horror, regret, and fear, rushed at once upon us. I  fired on the tiger; he seemed agitated; my companion fired also, and, in  a few minutes after this, our unfortunate friend came up to us bathed in  blood. Every medical assistance was vain, and he expired in the space of  twenty-four hours, having received such deep wounds from the teeth and  claws of the animal, as rendered his recovery hopeless. A large fire,  consisting of ten or twelve whole trees, was blazing by us at the time  this accident took place, and ten or more natives were with us. The  human mind can scarce form any idea of the scene of horror. We had  hardly pushed our boat from that accursed shore, when the tigress made  her appearance, almost raging mad, and remained on the sand, exhibiting  signs of the utmost ferocity, all the while we continued in sight.\"    There is an account given of a small party who entered a cave, to seek  shelter from a terrible storm, in South America. The storm raged with  such violence, that they could not hear each other speak; the  cedar-trees were struck down, and the torrents of rain rushed from the  mountains. Suddenly a growling noise was heard at the end of the cave.  They soon found, to their amazement and horror, that they had taken  refuge "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#19)"],[1,"slowly three or four times through the Y-tube. It will be found that the  inspired air passes through one bottle and the expired air through the  other. Compare the effect upon the limewater in the two bottles. Insert a  small burning splinter into the top of each bottle and note result. What  differences between inspired and expired air are thus shown?    3. Blow the breath against a cold window pane. Note and account for the  collection of moisture.    4. Note the temperature of the room as shown by a thermometer. Now breathe  several times upon the bulb, noting the rise in the mercury. What does  this experiment show the body to be losing through the breath?    *To show Changes in the Thoracic Cavity.*--1. To a yard- or meter-stick,  attach two vertical strips, each about eight inches long, as shown in Fig.  51. The piece at the end should be secured firmly in place by screws or  nails. The other should be movable. With this contrivance measure the  sideward and forward expansion of a boy's thorax. Take the diameter first  during a complete inspiration and then during a complete expiration,  reading the difference. Compare the forward with the sideward expansion.                                    [Fig. 51]                  Fig. 51--*Apparatus* for measuring chest expansion.      2. With a tape-line take the circumference of the chest when all the air  possible has been expelled from the lungs. Take it again when the lungs  have been fully inflated. The difference is now read as the chest  expansion.                                    [Fig. 52]       Fig. 52--*Simple apparatus* for illustrating the action of the diaphragm.      *To illustrate the Action of the Diaphragm.*--Remove the bottom from a  large bottle having a small neck. (Scratch a deep mark with a file and  hold on the end of this mark a hot poker. When the glass cracks, lead the  crack around the bottle by heating about one half inch in advance of it.)  Place the bottle in a large glass jar filled two thirds full of water  (Fig. 52). Let the space above the water represent the chest cavity and  the water surface represent the diaphragm. Raise the bottle, noting that  the water falls, thereby increasing the space and causing air to enter.  Then lower the bottle, noting the opposite effect. To show the movement of  the air in and out of the bottle, hold with the hand (or arrange a support  for) a burning splinter over the mouth of the bottle.    *To estimate the Capacity of the Lungs.*--Breathing as naturally as  possible, expel the air into a spirometer (lung tester) during a period,  say of ten respirations (Fig. 53). Note the total amount of air exhaled  and the number of \"breaths\" and calculate the amount of air exhaled at  each breath. This is called the _tidal_ air.                                    [Fig. 53]      Fig. 53--*Apparatus* (spirometer) for measuring the capacity of the lungs.      2. After an ordinary inspiration empty the lungs as completely as possible  into the spirometer, noting the quantity exhaled. This amount, less the  tidal air, is known as the _reserve_ air. The air which is now left in the  lungs is called the _residual_ air. On the theory that this is equal in  amount to the reserve air, calculate the capacity of the lungs in an  ordinary inspiration.    3. Now fill the lungs to the full expansion of the chest and empty them as  completely as possible into the spirometer, noting the amount expelled.  This, less the tidal air and the reserve air, is called the _complemental_  air. Now calculate the total capacity of the lungs.          CHAPTER VIII - PASSAGE OF OXYGEN THROUGH THE BODY      What is the nature of oxygen? What is its purpose in the body and how does  it serve this purpose? How is the blood able to take it up at the lungs  and give it off at the cells? What becomes of it after being used? These  are questions touching the maintenance of life and they deserve careful  consideration.    *Nature of Oxygen.*--To understand the relation which oxygen sustains to  the body we must acquaint ourselves with certain of its chemical  properties. It is an element(44) of intense affinity, or combining power,  and is one of the most active of all chemical agents. It is able to  combine with most of the other elements to form chemical compounds. A  familiar example of its combining action is found in ordinary combustion,  or burning. On account of the part it plays in this process, oxygen is  called the _supporter of combustion_; but it supports combustion by the  simple method of uniting. The ashes that are left and the invisible gases  that escape into the atmosphere are the compounds formed by the uniting  process. It thus appears that oxygen, in common with the other elements,  may exist in either of two forms:    1. That in which it is in a _free_, or uncombined, condition--the form in  which it exists in the atmosphere.    2. That in which it is a part of compounds, such as the compounds formed  in combustion.    Oxygen manifests its activity to the best advantage when it is in a free  state, or, more accurately speaking, when it is passing from the free  state into one of combination. It is separated from its compounds and  brought again into a free state by overcoming with heat, or some other  force, the affinity which causes it to unite.    *How Oxygen unites.*--The chemist believes oxygen, as well as all other  substances, to be made up of exceedingly small particles, called _atoms_.  The atoms do not exist singly in either elements or compounds, but are  united with each other to form groups of atoms that are called  _molecules_. In an element the molecules are made up of one kind of atoms,  but in a compound the molecules are made up of as many kinds of atoms as  there are elements in the compound. Changes in the composition of  substances (called chemical changes) are due to rearrangements of the  atoms and the formation of new molecules. The atoms, therefore, are the  units of chemical combination. In the formation of new compounds they  unite, and in the breaking up of existing compounds they separate.    The uniting of oxygen is no exception to this general law. All of its  combinations are brought about by the uniting of its atoms. In the burning  of carbon, for example, the atoms of oxygen and the atoms of carbon unite,  forming molecules of the compound known as carbon dioxide. The chemical  formula of this compound, which is CO_2, shows the proportion in which the  atoms unite--one atom of carbon uniting with two atoms of oxygen in each of  the molecules. The affinity of oxygen for other elements, and the affinity  of other elements for oxygen, and for each other, resides in their atoms.    *Oxidation.*--The uniting of oxygen with other elements is termed  _oxidation_. This may take place slowly or rapidly, the two rates being  designated as _slow_ oxidation and _rapid_ oxidation. Examples of slow  oxidation are found in certain kinds of decay and in the rusting of iron.  Combustion is an example of rapid oxidation. Slow and rapid oxidation,  while differing widely in their effects upon surrounding objects, are  alike in that both produce heat and form compounds of oxygen. In slow  oxidation, however, the heat may come off so gradually that it is not  observed.    *Movement of Oxygen through the Body.*--Oxygen has been shown in the  preceding chapters to pass from the lungs into the blood and later to  leave the blood and, passing through the lymph, to enter the cells. That  oxygen does not become a permanent constituent of the cells is shown by  the constancy of the body weight. Nearly two pounds of oxygen per day are  known to enter the cells of the average-sized person. If this became a  permanent part of the cells, the body would increase in weight from day to  day. Since the body weight remains constant, or nearly so, we must  conclude that oxygen leaves the body about as fast as it enters. Oxygen  enters the body as a _free_ element. The form in which it leaves the body  will be understood when we realize the purpose which it serves and the  method by which it serves this purpose.    *Purpose of Oxygen in the Body.*--The question may be raised: Is it  possible for oxygen to serve a purpose in the body without remaining in  it? This, of course, depends upon what the purpose is. That it is possible  for oxygen to serve a purpose and at the same time pass on through the  place where it serves that purpose, is seen by studying the combustion in  an ordinary stove (Fig. 54). Oxygen enters at the draft and for the most  part passes out at the flue, but in passing through the stove it unites  with, or oxidizes, the fuel, causing the combustion which produces the  heat.                                    [Fig. 54]                  Fig. 54--*Coal stove* illustrating rapid oxidation.      Now it is found that certain chemical processes, mainly oxidations, are  taking place in the body. These produce the heat for keeping it warm and  also supply other forms of energy,(45) including motion. It is the purpose  of oxygen to keep up these oxidations and, by so doing, to aid in  supplying the body with energy. It serves this purpose in much the same  way that it supports combustion, _i.e._, by uniting with, or oxidizing,  materials derived from foods that are present in the cells.    *Does Oxygen serve Other Purposes?*--It has been suggested that oxygen may  serve the purpose of oxidizing, or destroying, substances that are  injurious and of acting, in this way, as a purifying agent in the body. In  support of this view is the natural tendency of oxygen to unite with  substances and the well-known fact that oxygen is an important natural  agent in purifying water. It seems probable, therefore, that it may to a  slight extent serve this purpose in the body. It is probable also that  oxygen aids through its chemical activity in the formation of compounds  which are to become a part of the cells. Both of"]]]
