It failed equally as a political  movement, for it never spread beyond a relatively narrow area in Upper  and Central India. The vast majority of the Indian people and princes  never even wavered. British rule passed through a trial by fire and it  emerged from the ordeal unscathed and fortified. For it was purged of  all the ambiguities of a dual position and of divided responsibilities.  The last of the Moghuls forfeited the shadowy remnants of an obsolete  sovereignty. Just a hundred years earlier Clive had advised after  Plassey that the Crown should assume direct sovereignty over the whole  of the British possessions in India, as the responsibility was growing  too heavy for the mere trading corporation that the East India Company  then still was. The Company had long ceased to be a mere trading  corporation. Transformed into a great agency of government and  administration, it had risen not unworthily to its immense  responsibilities. But the time had come for the final step. The Company  disappeared and the Crown assumed full and sole responsibility for the  government and administration of India. The change was in effect more  formal than real. The Governor-General came to be known as the Viceroy,  and the Secretary of State in Council took the place of the old  President of the Board of Control. But the system remained as before one  of paternal despotism in India, to be tempered still by the control of  Parliament at home.    Only in one respect had the reactionary forces at the back of the Mutiny  scored some success. The Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria on her  assumption of \"the government of the territories in India heretofore  administered in trust for us by the Honourable East India Company,\" was  a solemn and earnest renewal of all the pledges already given to the  princes and people of India. It emphasised the determination of the  Crown to abstain from all interference with their religious belief or  worship. It reiterated the assurance that \"as far as may be,\" her  subjects \"of whatever race or creed\" would be freely and impartially  admitted to offices in the service of the Crown, \"the duties of which  they may be qualified by their education, ability, and integrity duly to  discharge,\" and that, \"generally in framing and administering the law,  due regard be paid to the ancient rights, usages, and customs of India.\"  It promised the wide exercise of her royal clemency to all offenders  save those actually guilty of murder during the recent outbreak. It  closed with a fine expression of her confidence and affection towards  her Indian subjects. \"In their prosperity will be our strength, in their  contentment our security, and in their gratitude our best reward.\" But  no Proclamation, however generous and sincere, could undo the moral harm  done by the Mutiny. The horrors which accompanied the rising and the  sternness of the repression left terrible memories behind them on both  sides, and this legacy of racial hatred acted as a blight on the growth  of the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation between Indians  and Englishmen in India which two generations of broad-minded Englishmen  and progressive Indians had sedulously and successfully cultivated.    If we look back upon the half-century after the Mutiny and before the  Partition of Bengal, which may be regarded as closing that long period  of paternal but autocratic government, it was one of internal peace and  of material progress which the large annual output of eloquent  statistics may be left to demonstrate. In 1857 there were not 200 miles  of railways in India, in 1905 there was a network of railways amounting  to over 28,000 miles, and the telegraph system expanded during the same  period from 4500 to 60,000 miles. The development of a great system of  irrigation canals added large new tracts of hitherto barren wastes to  the cultivable area of the country, and an elaborate machinery of  precautionary measures and relief works was created to mitigate the  hardships of periodical famines unavoidable in regions where a  predominantly agricultural population is largely dependent for existence  on the varying abundance or shortage of the seasonal rainfalls. The  incidence and methods of collection of the land-tax, the backbone of  Indian revenue, were carefully corrected and perfected, and the burden  of taxation readjusted and on the whole lightened. Those were the days  of _laisser-faire_, _laisser-aller_ at home, and it was not deemed to  be part of the duties of government to give any special protection to  Indian commerce, whilst the operation of free trade principles in India  checked the industrial development of the country. Nevertheless the  internal and external trade of India expanded continually, and the  cotton mills in Western India, and the jute mills in Calcutta, as well  as the opening up of coal mines in Bengal and of gold mines in Southern  India showed how great were the natural resources of the peninsula still  awaiting development; and under Lord Curzon's administration, which  reached during the first years of the present century the high-water  mark of efficiency, a department was created to deal specially with  commerce and industry. In spite of several famines of unusual intensity  and of the appearance in India in 1896 of a new scourge in the shape of  the bubonic plague, which has carried off since then over eight million  people, the population increased by leaps and bounds, and the census of  1901 showed it to have reached in our Indian Empire the huge figure of  nearly 300,000,000--which it has since then exceeded by another  20,000,000--or about a fifth of the estimated population of the whole  globe. It had risen since the first census officially recorded in 1871  by nearly 30 per cent--no mean evidence that fifty years of peaceful and  efficient administration had produced an increased sense of welfare and  confidence.    The great bulk of the population, mostly a simple and ignorant peasantry  whose horizon does not extend beyond their own village and the fields  that surround it, accepted with more or less conscious gratitude the  material benefits conferred upon them by alien rulers with whom they  were seldom brought into actual contact save through the occasional  presence of a District officer on tour, almost invariably humane and  kindly and anxious to do even-handed justice to all. Another class of  Indians, chiefly dwellers in large cities, infinitesimally small  numerically but constantly increasing in numbers and still more rapidly  in activity and influence, saw, however, in an autocratic form of  government, of which it even questioned the efficiency, an  insurmountable barrier to the aspirations which Western education had  taught it to entertain. The list of graduates from Indian Universities  lengthened every year, the number of schools and colleges in which young  Indians acquired at least the rudiments of Western knowledge grew and  multiplied in every province. Western-educated Indians flocked to the  bar; they showed themselves qualified for most of the liberal  professions; they filled every post that was open to them in the public  services. But where, they asked with growing impatience, was the  fulfilment of the hopes which they had founded on the Queen's  Proclamation of 1858? There had been perhaps no departure from the  letter of the Proclamation, but had its spirit been translated into  effective practice? Was it never to be interpreted in the same generous  sense in which a still earlier generation of British administrators had  interpreted their mission as a means to train the Indians to protect and  govern themselves?    The Indian army, reorganised after the Mutiny, displayed all its old  qualities of loyalty and gallantry in the course of the numerous foreign  expeditions in which it was employed in co-operation with the British  army, in Egypt and the Sudan, in Afghanistan, China, and Tibet, in  addition to the chronic frontier fighting on the turbulent North-West  border. The menace of Russia's persistent expansion towards India  through Central Asia and the ascendancy for which she was at the same  time striving in the Near East and the Far East, and later on the far  more real menace of German aspirations to world-dominion, lent added  importance to the maintenance of an efficient Indian army as an  essential factor in the defensive forces of the Empire. But there was no  departure from the old system under which not only were army  administration and all the higher commands reserved for British  officers, but the whole army was kept as a fighting machine entirely  dependent upon British leadership. The native officers of an Indian  regiment, mostly promoted from the ranks, could in no circumstances rise  to a position in which they might give orders to a British officer,  whilst, however senior in years and service, they were under the orders  of the youngest British subaltern gazetted to the regiment. No other  system was indeed possible so long as no attempt was made to give to  Indians any higher military training, or to hold out to them any  prospects of promotion beyond those within their reach by enlistment in  the ranks. These Indian officers, drawn from races that had acquired a  martial reputation and often from families with whom military service  was an hereditary tradition, were as a rule not only very fine fighters  but gallant native gentlemen, between whom and their British officers  there existed very cordial relations, human and professional, based upon  an instinctive recognition of differences of education and similarities"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#19)"],[1,"the memory of the sash.    [Illustration: TERESA CARRENO]    \"I assure you that at heart I feel no older now than in the days when I  wore it,\" she said. The conversation then turned to questions of  mastering the piano, with particular reference to the remarkable  technic of the artist herself.    \"The fact that I began my studies at a very early age was a great  advantage to me,\" she said. \"I loved the sound of the piano, and began  to pick out bits of tunes when I was little more than three. At six and  a half I began to study seriously, so that when I was nine I was playing  such pieces as Chopin's Ballade in A flat. Another fact which was of the  utmost advantage to me was that I had an ideal teacher in my father. He  saw that I loved the piano, and decided I must be properly taught. He  was passionately fond of music, and if he had not been a statesman,  laboring for the good of his country, he would undoubtedly have been a  great musician. He developed a wonderful system for teaching the piano,  and the work he did with me I now do with my pupils. For one thing he  invented a series of stretching and gymnastic exercises which are  splendid; they did wonders for me, and I use them constantly in my  teaching. But, like everything else, they must be done in the right way,  or they are not beneficial.      580 TECHNICAL EXERCISES    \"My father wrote out for me a great many technical exercises; to be  exact, there were 580 of them! Some consisted of difficult passages  from the great composers--perhaps originally written for one hand--which  he would arrange for two hands, so that each hand had the same amount of  work to do. Thus both my hands had equal training, and I find no  difference between them. These 580 exercises took just three days to go  through. Everything must be played in all keys, and with every possible  variety of touch--legato, staccato, half-staccato, and so on; also, with  all kinds of shading.\"    (Think of such a drill in pure technic, O ye teachers and students, who  give little or no time to such matters outside of etudes and pieces!)    \"Part of my training consisted in being shown how to criticize myself. I  learned to listen, to be critical, to judge my own work; for if it was  not up to the mark I must see what was the matter and correct it myself.  The earlier this can be learned the better. I attribute much of my  subsequent success to this ability. I still carry out this plan, for  there on the piano you will find all the notes for my coming recitals,  which I work over and take with me everywhere. This method of study I  always try to instill into my pupils. I tell them any one can make a  lot of _noise_ on the piano, but I want them, to make the piano _speak_!  I can do only a certain amount for them; the rest they must do for  themselves.      VALUE OF TRANSPOSING    \"Another item my zealous teacher insisted upon was transposing. I  absorbed this idea almost unconsciously, and hardly know when I learned  to transpose, so natural did it seem to me. My father was a tactful  teacher; he never commanded, but would merely say, 'You can play this in  the key of C, but I doubt if you can play it in the key of D.' This  doubt was the spur to fire my ambition and pride: I would show him I  could play it in the key of D, or in any other key; and I did!    \"With all the technic exercises, I had many etudes also; a great deal of  Czerny. Each etude must also be transposed, for it would never do to  play an etude twice in the same key for my father. So I may say that  whatever I could perform at all, I was able to play in any key.    \"For one year I did nothing but technic, and then I had my first piece,  which was nothing less than the Capriccio of Mendelssohn, Op. 22. So you  see I had been well grounded; indeed I have been grateful all my life  for the thorough foundation which was laid for me. In these days we hear  of so many 'short cuts,' so many new methods, mechanical and otherwise,  of studying the piano; but I fail to see that they arrive at the goal  any quicker, or make any more thorough musicians than those who come by  the royal road of intelligent, well-directed hard work.\"    Asked how she obtained great power with the least expenditure of  physical strength, Mme. Carreno continued:    \"The secret of power lies in relaxation; or I might say, power _is_  relaxation. This word, however, is apt to be misunderstood. You tell  pupils to relax, and if they do not understand how and when they get  nowhere. Relaxation does not mean to flop all over the piano; it means,  rather, to loosen just where it is needed and nowhere else. For the  heavy chords in the Tschaikowsky Concerto my arms are absolutely limp  from the shoulder; in fact, I am not conscious I have arms. That is why  I can play for hours without the slightest fatigue. It is really mental  relaxation, for one has to think it; it must be in the mind first before  it can be worked out in arms and hands. We have to think it and then act  it.    \"This quality of my playing must have impressed Breithaupt, for, as you  perhaps know, it was after he heard me play that he wrote his famous  book on 'Weight Touch,' which is dedicated to me. A second and revised  edition of this work, by the way, is an improvement on the first. Many  artists and musicians have told me I have a special quality of tone; if  this is true I am convinced this quality is the result of controlled  relaxation.\"    I referred to the artist's hand as being of exceptional adaptability for  the piano.    \"Yes,\" she answered, \"and it resembles closely the hand of Rubinstein.  This brings to mind a little incident. As a small child, I was taken to  London, and on one occasion played in the presence of Rubinstein; he was  delighted, took me under his wing, and introduced me all about as his  musical daughter. Years afterward we came to New York, and located at  the old Clarendon Hotel, which has housed so many men of note. The first  day at lunch, my aunt and I were seated at a table mostly occupied by  elderly ladies, who stared at us curiously. I was a shy slip of a girl,  and hardly ventured to raise my eyes after the first look around the  room. Beside me sat a gentleman. I glanced at his hand as it rested on  the table--then I looked more closely; how much it reminded me of  Rubinstein's hand! My eyes traveled slowly up to the gentleman's  face--it was Rubinstein! He was looking at me; then he turned and  embraced me, before all those observing ladles!\"    We spoke of Berlin, the home of the pianist, and of its musical life,  mentioning von Buelow and Klindworth. \"Both good friends of mine,\" she  commented. \"What a wonderful work Klindworth has accomplished in his  editions of Beethoven and Chopin! As Goethe said of himself, we can say  of Klindworth--he has carved his own monument in this work. We should  revere him for the great service he has done the pianistic world.    \"I always love to play in America, and each time I come I discover how  much you have grown. The musical development here is wonderful. This  country is very far from being filled with a mercenary and commercial  spirit. If Europeans think so it is because they do not know the  American at home. Your progress in music is a marvel! There is a great  deal of idealism here, and idealism is the very heart and soul of music.    \"I feel the artist has such a beautiful calling--a glorious message--to  educate a people to see the beauty and grandeur of his art--of the  ideal!\"          XXII    WILHELM BACHAUS    TECHNICAL PROBLEMS DISCUSSED      \"How do I produce the effects which I obtain from the piano?\"    The young German artist, Willielm Bachaus, was comfortably seated in his  spacious apartments at the Ritz, New York, when this question was asked.  A grand piano stood close at hand, and the pianist ran his fingers  lightly over its keys from time to time, or illustrated some technical  point as he talked.    \"In answer I would say I produce them by listening, criticizing,  judging--working over the point, until I get it as I want it. Then I can  reproduce it at will, if I want to make just the same effect; but  sometimes I want to change and try another.    [Illustration: WILHELM BACHAUS]    \"I am particular about the seat I use at the piano, as I sit lower than  most amateurs, who in general are apt to sit too high. My piano stool  has just been taken out for a few repairs, or I could show you how low  it is. Then I am old-fashioned enough to still believe in scales and  arpeggios. Some of the players of the present day seem to have no use  for such things, but I find them of great importance. This does not  necessarily mean that I go through the whole set of keys when I practise  the scales; but I select a few at a time, and work at those. I start  with ridiculously simple forms--just the hand over the thumb, and the  thumb under the hand--a few movements each way, especially for  arpeggios. The principle I have referred to is the difficult point; a  few doses of this remedy, however, bring the hand up into order again.\"    The pianist turned to the keyboard and illustrated the point very  clearly.    \"As you see, I slant the hand considerably across the keys,\" he said,  \"but this oblique position is more comfortable, and the hand can  accommodate itself to the intervals of the arpeggio, or to the passing  of the thumb in scales. Some may think I stick out the elbow too much,  but I don't care for that, if by this means the scale becomes smooth and  even.      OVERHAULING ONE'S TECHNIC    \"I have to overhaul my technic once or twice a week, to see that  everything is all right--and of course the scales and arpeggios come in  for their share of criticism. I practise them in legato, staccato and in  other touches, but mostly in legato, as that is somewhat more difficult  and more beautiful than the others.    \"Perhaps I have what might be called a natural technic; that is I"]]]
