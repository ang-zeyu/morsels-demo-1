[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#19)"],[1,"in  this Tablet, Divine chastisement shall assail you from every direction,  and the sentence of His justice shall be pronounced against you.... Twenty  years have passed, O kings, during which We have, each day, tasted the  agony of a fresh tribulation.... Though aware of most of Our afflictions,  ye, nevertheless, have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor. For is it  not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal  equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully  demonstrated to all mankind?\"    No wonder that Baha'u'llah, in view of the treatment meted out to Him by  the sovereigns of the earth, should, as already quoted, have written these  words: \"From two ranks amongst men power hath been seized: kings and  ecclesiastics.\" Indeed, He even goes further, and states in His Tablet  addressed to _Sh_ay_kh_ Salman: \"One of the signs of the maturity of the  world is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship  will remain with none willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be  the day whereon wisdom will be manifested among mankind. Only in order to  proclaim the Cause of God and spread abroad His Faith will anyone be  willing to bear this grievous weight. Well is it with him who, for love of  God and His Cause, and for the sake of God and for the purpose of  proclaiming His Faith, will expose himself unto this great danger, and  will accept this toil and trouble.\"            RECOGNITION OF KINGSHIP      Let none, however, mistake or unwittingly misrepresent the purpose of  Baha'u'llah. Severe as has been His condemnation pronounced against those  sovereigns who persecuted Him, and however strict the censure expressed  collectively against those who failed signally in their clear duty to  investigate the truth of His Faith and to restrain the hand of the  wrongdoer, His teachings embody no principle that can, in any way, be  construed as a repudiation, or even a disparagement, however veiled, of  the institution of kingship. The catastrophic fall, and the extinction of  the dynasties and empires of those monarchs whose disastrous end He  particularly prophesied, and the declining fortunes of the sovereigns of  His Own generation, whom He generally reproved--both constituting a passing  phase of the evolution of the Faith--should, in no wise, be confounded with  the future position of that institution. Indeed if we delve into the  writings of the Author of the Baha'i Faith, we cannot fail to discover  unnumbered passages in which, in terms that none can misrepresent, the  principle of kingship is eulogized, the rank and conduct of just and  fair-minded kings is extolled, the rise of monarchs, ruling with justice  and even professing His Faith, is envisaged, and the solemn duty to arise  and ensure the triumph of Baha'i sovereigns is inculcated. To conclude  from the above quoted words, addressed by Baha'u'llah to the monarchs of  the earth, to infer from the recital of the woeful disasters that have  overtaken so many of them, that His followers either advocate or  anticipate the definite extinction of the institution of kingship, would  indeed be tantamount to a distortion of His teaching.    I can do no better than quote some of Baha'u'llah's Own testimonies,  leaving the reader to shape his own judgment as to the falsity of such a  deduction. In His \"Epistle to the Son of the Wolf\" He indicates the true  source of kingship: \"Regard for the rank of sovereigns is divinely  ordained, as is clearly attested by the words of the Prophets of God and  His chosen ones. He Who is the Spirit [Jesus]--may peace be upon Him--was  asked: 'O Spirit of God! Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?'  And He made reply: 'Yea, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,  and to God the things that are God's.' He forbade it not. These two  sayings are, in the estimation of men of insight, one and the same, for if  that which belonged to Caesar had not come from God He would have  forbidden it. And likewise in the sacred verse: 'Obey God and obey the  Apostle, and those among you invested with authority.' By 'those invested  with authority' is meant primarily and more specially the Imams--the  blessings of God rest upon them. They verily are the manifestations of the  power of God and the sources of His authority, and the repositories of His  knowledge, and the daysprings of His commandments. Secondarily these words  refer unto the kings and rulers--those through the brightness of whose  justice the horizons of the world are resplendent and luminous.\"    And again: \"In the Epistle to the Romans Saint Paul hath written: 'Let  every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of  God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore,  resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.' And further: 'For he  is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth  evil.' He saith that the appearance of the kings, and their majesty and  power, are of God.\"    And again: \"A just king enjoyeth nearer access unto God than anyone. Unto  this testifieth He Who speaketh in His Most Great Prison.\"    Likewise in the Bi_sh_arat (Glad-Tidings) Baha'u'llah asserts that \"the  majesty of kingship is one of the signs of God.\" \"We do not wish,\" He  adds, \"that the countries of the world should be deprived thereof.\"    In the Kitab-i-Aqdas He sets forth His purpose, and eulogizes the king who  will profess His Faith: \"By the Righteousness of God! It is not Our wish  to lay hands on your kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the  hearts of men. Upon them the eyes of Baha are fastened. To this testifieth  the Kingdom of Names, could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his  Lord, will renounce the world and all that is therein; how much greater,  then, must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station!\" \"How  great the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My  Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such a  king is numbered with the Companions of the Crimson Ark--the Ark which God  hath prepared for the people of Baha. All must glorify his name, must  reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of  My Name, the Omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and  invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous  ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the  whole world. Offer up, O people of Baha, your substance, nay your very  lives, for his assistance.\"    In the Lawh-i-Sultan Baha'u'llah further reveals the significance of  kingship: \"A just king is the shadow of God on earth. All should seek  shelter under the shadow of his justice, and rest in the shade of his  favor. This is not a matter which is either specific or limited in its  scope, that it might be restricted to one or another person, inasmuch as  the shadow telleth of the One Who casteth it. God, glorified be His  remembrance, hath called Himself the Lord of the worlds, for He hath  nurtured and still nurtureth everyone. Glorified be, then, His grace that  hath preceded all created things, and His mercy that hath surpassed the  worlds.\"    In one of His Tablets Baha'u'llah has also written: \"The one true God,  exalted be His glory, hath bestowed the government of the earth upon the  kings. To none is given the right to act in any manner that would run  counter to the considered views of them who are in authority. That which  He hath reserved for Himself are the cities of men's hearts; and of these  the loved ones of Him Who is the Sovereign Truth are, in this Day, as the  keys.\"    In the following passage He expresses this wish: \"We cherish the hope that  one of the kings of the earth will, for the sake of God, arise for the  triumph of this wronged, this oppressed people. Such a king will be  eternally extolled and glorified. God hath prescribed unto this people the  duty of aiding whosoever will aid them, of serving his best interests, and  of demonstrating to him their abiding loyalty.\"    In the Lawh-i-Ra'is He actually and categorically prophesies the rise of  such a king: \"Erelong will God raise up from among the kings one who will  aid His loved ones. He, verily, encompasseth all things. He will instill  in the hearts the love of His loved ones. This, indeed, is irrevocably  decreed by One Who is the Almighty, the Beneficent.\" In the  Ridvanu'l-'Adl, wherein the virtue of justice is exalted, He makes a  parallel prediction: \"Erelong will God make manifest on earth kings who  will recline on the couches of justice, and will rule amongst men even as  they rule their own selves. They, indeed, are among the choicest of My  creatures in the entire creation.\"    In the Kitab-i-Aqdas He visualizes in these words the elevation to the  throne of His native city, \"the Mother of the World\" and \"the Dayspring of  Light,\" of a king who will be adorned with the twin ornaments of justice  and of devotion to His Faith: \"Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Ta, for  God hath chosen thee to be the source of the joy of all mankind. He shall,  if it be His will, bless thy throne with one who will rule with justice,  who will gather together the flock of God which the wolves have scattered.  Such a ruler will, with joy and gladness, turn his face towards and extend  his favors unto, the people of Baha. He indeed is accounted in the sight  of God as a jewel among men. Upon him rest forever the glory of God, and  the glory of all that dwell in the kingdom of His Revelation.\"            THE CRUMBLING OF RELIGIOUS ORTHODOXY      Dear friends! The decline in the fortunes of the crowned wielders of  temporal power has been paralleled by a no less startling deterioration in  the influence exercised by the world's spiritual leaders. The colossal  events that have heralded the dissolution of so many kingdoms"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#19)"],[1,"is withdrawn from it, the flower or the man  dies. It is therefore clear that attraction, harmony, unity and Love, are  the cause of life, whereas repulsion, discord, hatred and separation bring  death.    We have seen that whatever brings division into the world of existence  causes death. Likewise in the world of the spirit does the same law  operate.    Therefore should every servant of the One God be obedient to the law of  love, avoiding all hatred, discord, and strife. We find when we observe  nature, that the gentler animals group themselves together into flocks and  herds, whereas the savage, ferocious creatures, such as the lion, the  tiger, and the wolf, live in wild forests, apart from civilization. Two  wolves, or two lions, may live amicably together; but a thousand lambs may  share the same fold and a large number of deer can form one herd. Two  eagles can dwell in the same place, but a thousand doves can gather into  one habitation.    Man should, at least, be numbered among the gentler animals; but when he  becomes ferocious he is more cruel and malicious than the most savage of  the animal creation!    Now Baha'u'llah has proclaimed the 'Unity of the World of Mankind'. All  peoples and nations are of one family, the children of one Father, and  should be to one another as brothers and sisters! I hope that you will  endeavour in your lives to show forth and spread this teaching.    Baha'u'llah said that we should love even our enemies and be to them as  friends. If all men were obedient to this principle, the greatest unity  and understanding would be established in the hearts of mankind.          THIRD PRINCIPLE      ['That religion ought to be a Cause of Love and Affection' is much  emphasized in many of the Discourses of which the Notes are given in this  book, as well as in the explanation of several of the other Principles.]          FOURTH PRINCIPLE--THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE RELATION BETWEEN RELIGION AND  SCIENCE      4 Avenue de Camoeens, Paris,  November 12th    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    I have spoken to you of some of the principles of Baha'u'llah: The Search  after Truth and The Unity of Mankind. I will now explain the Fourth  Principle, which is The Acceptance of the Relation between Religion and  Science.    There is no contradiction between true religion and science. When a  religion is opposed to science it becomes mere superstition: that which is  contrary to knowledge is ignorance.    How can a man believe to be a fact that which science has proved to be  impossible? If he believes in spite of his reason, it is rather ignorant  superstition than faith. The true principles of all religions are in  conformity with the teachings of science.    The Unity of God is logical, and this idea is not antagonistic to the  conclusions arrived at by scientific study.    All religions teach that we must do good, that we must be generous,  sincere, truthful, law-abiding, and faithful; all this is reasonable, and  logically the only way in which humanity can progress.    All religious laws conform to reason, and are suited to the people for  whom they are framed, and for the age in which they are to be obeyed.    Religion has two main parts:    (1) The Spiritual.    (2) The Practical.    The spiritual part never changes. All the Manifestations of God and His  Prophets have taught the same truths and given the same spiritual law.  They all teach the one code of morality. There is no division in the  truth. The Sun has sent forth many rays to illumine human intelligence,  the light is always the same.    The practical part of religion deals with exterior forms and ceremonies,  and with modes of punishment for certain offences. This is the material  side of the law, and guides the customs and manners of the people.    In the time of Moses, there were ten crimes punishable by death. When  Christ came this was changed; the old axiom 'an eye for an eye, and a  tooth for a tooth' was converted into 'Love your enemies, do good to them  that hate you', the stern old law being changed into one of love, mercy  and forbearance!    In the former days the punishment for theft was the cutting off of the  right hand; in our time this law could not be so applied. In this age, a  man who curses his father is allowed to live, when formerly he would have  been put to death. It is therefore evident that whilst the spiritual law  never alters, the practical rules must change their application with the  necessities of the time. The spiritual aspect of religion is the greater,  the more important of the two, and this is the same for all time, it never  changes! It is the same, yesterday, today, and for ever! 'As it was the  beginning, is now, and ever shall be.'    Now, all questions of morality contained in the spiritual, immutable law  of every religion are logically right. If religion were contrary to  logical reason then it would cease to be a religion and be merely a  tradition. Religion and science are the two wings upon which man's  intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the human soul can  progress. It is not possible to fly with one wing alone! Should a man try  to fly with the wing of religion alone he would quickly fall into the  quagmire of superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing of  science alone he would also make no progress, but fall into the despairing  slough of materialism. All religions of the present day have fallen into  superstitious practices, out of harmony alike with the true principles of  the teaching they represent and with the scientific discoveries of the  time. Many religious leaders have grown to think that the importance of  religion lies mainly in the adherence to a collection of certain dogmas  and the practice of rites and ceremonies! Those whose souls they profess  to cure are taught to believe likewise, and these cling tenaciously to the  outward forms, confusing them with the inward truth.    Now, these forms and rituals differ in the various churches and amongst  the different sects, and even contradict one another; giving rise to  discord, hatred, and disunion. The outcome of all this dissension is the  belief of many cultured men that religion and science are contradictory  terms, that religion needs no powers of reflection, and should in no wise  be regulated by science, but must of necessity be opposed, the one to the  other. The unfortunate effect of this is that science has drifted apart  from religion, and religion has become a mere blind and more or less  apathetic following of the precepts of certain religious teachers, who  insist on their own favourite dogmas being accepted even when they are  contrary to science. This is foolishness, for it is quite evident that  science is the light, and, being so, religion truly so-called does not  oppose knowledge.    We are familiar with the phrases 'Light and Darkness', 'Religion and  Science'. But the religion which does not walk hand in hand with science  is itself in the darkness of superstition and ignorance.    Much of the discord and disunion of the world is created by these man-made  oppositions and contradictions. If religion were in harmony with science  and they walked together, much of the hatred and bitterness now bringing  misery to the human race would be at an end.    Consider what it is that singles man out from among created beings, and  makes of him a creature apart. Is it not his reasoning power, his  intelligence? Shall he not make use of these in his study of religion? I  say unto you: weigh carefully in the balance of reason and science  everything that is presented to you as religion. If it passes this test,  then accept it, for it is truth! If, however, it does not so conform, then  reject it, for it is ignorance!    Look around and see how the world of today is drowned in superstition and  outward forms!    Some worship the product of their own imagination: they make for  themselves an imaginary God and adore this, when the creation of their  finite minds cannot be the Infinite Mighty Maker of all things visible and  invisible! Others worship the sun or trees, also stones! In past ages  there were those who adored the sea, the clouds, and even clay!    Today, men have grown into such adoring attachment to outward forms and  ceremonies that they dispute over this point of ritual or that particular  practice, until one hears on all sides of wearisome arguments and unrest.  There are individuals who have weak intellects and their powers of  reasoning have not developed, but the strength and power of religion must  not be doubted because of the incapacity of these persons to understand.    A small child cannot comprehend the laws that govern nature, but this is  on account of the immature intellect of that child; when he is grown older  and has been educated he too will understand the everlasting truths. A  child does not grasp the fact that the earth revolves round the sun, but,  when his intelligence is awakened, the fact is clear and plain to him.    It is impossible for religion to be contrary to science, even though some  intellects are too weak or too immature to understand truth.    God made religion and science to be the measure, as it were, of our  understanding. Take heed that you neglect not such a wonderful power.  Weigh all things in this balance.    To him who has the power of comprehension religion is like an open book,  but how can it be possible for a man devoid of reason and intellectuality  to understand the Divine Realities of God?    Put all your beliefs into harmony with science; there can be no  opposition, for truth is one. When religion, shorn of its superstitions,  traditions, and unintelligent dogmas, shows its conformity with science,  then will there be a great unifying, cleansing force in the world which  will sweep before it all wars, disagreements, discords and struggles--and  then will mankind be united in the power of the Love of God.
