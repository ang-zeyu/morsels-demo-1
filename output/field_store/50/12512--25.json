[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#19)"],[1," not  sent in an envelope. Other people turn them down from force of habit and  mean nothing whatever. But whichever the reason, more cards are bent or  dog-eared than are left flat.      =ENGRAVED CARDS ANNOUNCING ENGAGEMENT, BAD FORM=    Someone somewhere asked whether or not to answer an engraved card  announcing an engagement. The answer can have nothing to do with  etiquette, since an engraved announcement is unknown to good society. (For  the proper announcement of an engagement see page 304.)      =WHEN PEOPLE SEE THEIR FRIENDS=    Five o'clock is the informal hour when people are \"at home\" to friends.  The correct hour for leaving cards and paying formal visits is between  3.30 and 4.30. One should hesitate to pay a visit at the \"tea hour\" unless  one is sure of one's welcome among the \"intimates\" likely to be found  around the hostess's tea-table.    Many ladies make it their practise to be home if possible at five o'clock,  and their friends who know them well come in at that time. (For the  afternoon tea-table and its customs, see page 171.)      =INFORMAL VISITING OFTEN ARRANGED BY TELEPHONE=    For instance, instead of ringing her door-bell, Mrs. Norman calls Mrs.  Kindhart on the telephone: \"I haven't seen you for weeks! Won't you come  in to tea, or to lunch--just you.\" Mrs. Kindhart answers, \"Yes, I'd love  to. I can come this afternoon\"; and five o'clock finds them together over  the tea-table.    In the same way young Struthers calls up Millicent Gilding, \"Are you going  to be in this afternoon?\" She says, \"Yes, but not until a quarter of six.\"  He says, \"Fine, I'll come then.\" Or she says, \"I'm so sorry, I'm playing  bridge with Pauline--but I'll be in to-morrow!\" He says, \"All right, I'll  come to-morrow.\"    The younger people rarely ever go to see each other without first  telephoning. Or since even young people seldom meet except for bridge,  most likely it is Millicent Gilding who telephones the Struthers youth to  ask if he can't possibly get uptown before five o'clock to make a fourth  with Mary and Jim and herself.      =HOW A FIRST VISIT IS MADE=    In very large cities, neighbors seldom call on each other. But if  strangers move into a neighborhood in a small town or in the country, or  at a watering-place, it is not only unfriendly but uncivil for their  neighbors not to call on them. The older residents always call on the  newer. And the person of greatest social prominence should make the first  visit, or at least invite the younger or less prominent one to call on  her; which the younger should promptly do.    Or two ladies of equal age or position may either one say, \"I wish you  would come to see me.\" To which the other replies \"I will with pleasure.\"  More usually the first one offers \"I should like to come to see you, if I  may.\" And the other, of course, answers \"I shall be delighted if you  will.\"    The first one, having suggested going to see the second, is bound in  politeness to do so, otherwise she implies that the acquaintance on second  thought seems distasteful to her.    Everyone invited to a wedding should call upon the bride on her return  from the honeymoon. And when a man marries a girl from a distant place,  courtesy absolutely demands that his friends and neighbors call on her as  soon as she arrives in her new home.      =ON OPENING THE DOOR TO A VISITOR=    On the hall table in every house, there should be a small silver, or other  card tray, a pad and a pencil. The nicest kind of pad is one that when  folded, makes its own envelope, so that a message when written need not be  left open. There are all varieties and sizes at all stationers.    When the door-bell rings, the servant on duty, who can easily see the  chauffeur or lady approaching, should have the card tray ready to present,  on the palm of the left hand. A servant at the door must never take the  cards in his or her fingers.      =CORRECT NUMBER OF CARDS TO LEAVE=    When the visitor herself rings the door-bell and the message is \"not at  home,\" the butler or maid proffers the card tray on which the visitor lays  a card of her own and her daughter's for each lady in the house and a card  of her husband's and son's for each lady and gentleman. But three is the  greatest number ever left of any one card. In calling on Mrs. Town, who  has three grown daughters and her mother living in the house, and a Mrs.  Stranger staying with her whom the visitor was invited to a luncheon to  meet, a card on each would need a packet of six. Instead, the visitor  should leave three--one for Mrs. Town, one for all the other ladies of the  house, and one for Mrs. Stranger. In asking to be received, her query at  the door should be \"Are any of the ladies at home?\" Or in merely leaving  her cards she should say \"For all of the ladies.\"      =WHEN THE CALLER LEAVES=    The butler or maid must stand with the front door open until a visitor  re-enters her motor, or if she is walking, until she has reached the  sidewalk. It is bad manners ever to close the door in a visitor's face.    When a chauffeur leaves cards, the door may be closed as soon as he turns  away.      =WHEN THE LADY OF THE HOUSE IS AT HOME=    When the door is opened by a waitress or a parlor-maid and the mistress of  the house is in the drawing-room, the maid says \"This way, please,\" and  leads the way. She goes as quickly as possible to present the card tray.  The guest, especially if a stranger, lags in order to give the hostess  time to read the name on the card.    The maid meanwhile moves aside, to make room for the approaching visitor,  who goes forward to shake hands with the hostess. If a butler is at the  door, he reads the card himself, picking it up from the tray, and opening  the door of the drawing-room announces: \"Mrs. Soandso,\" after which he  puts the card on the hall table.    The duration of a formal visit should be in the neighborhood of twenty  minutes. But if other visitors are announced, the first one--on a very  formal occasion--may cut her visit shorter. Or if conversation becomes  especially interesting, the visit may be prolonged five minutes or so. On  no account must a visitor stay an hour!    A hostess always rises when a visitor enters, unless the visitor is a  very young woman or man and she herself elderly, or unless she is seated  behind the tea-table so that rising is difficult. She should, however,  always rise and go forward to meet a lady much older than herself; but she  never rises from her tea-table to greet a man, unless he is quite old.    If the lady of the house is \"at home\" but up-stairs, the servant at the  door leads the visitor into the reception room, saying \"Will you take a  seat, please?\" and then carries the card to the mistress of the house.    On an exceptional occasion, such as paying a visit of condolence or  inquiring for a convalescent, when the question as to whether he will be  received is necessarily doubtful, a gentleman does not take off his coat  or gloves, but waits in the reception room with his hat in his hand. When  the servant returning says either \"Will you come this way, please?\" or  \"Mrs. Town is not well enough to see any one, but Miss Alice will be down  in a moment,\" the visitor divests himself of his coat and gloves, which  the servant carries, as well as his hat, out to the front hall.    As said before, few men pay visits without first telephoning. But perhaps  two or three times during a winter a young man, when he is able to get  away from his office in time, will make a tea-time visit upon a hostess  who has often invited him to dinner or to her opera box. Under ordinary  circumstances, however, some woman member of his family leaves his card  for him after a dinner or a dance, or else it is not left at all.    A gentleman paying visits, always asks if the hostess is at home. If she  is, he leaves his hat and stick in the hall and also removes and leaves  his gloves--and rubbers should he be wearing them. If the hour is between  five and half-past, the hostess is inevitably at her tea-table, in the  library, to which, if he is at all well known to the servant at the door,  he is at once shown without being first asked to wait in the reception  room. A gentleman entering a room in which there are several people who  are strangers, shakes hands with his hostess and slightly bows to all the  others, whether he knows them personally or not. He, of course, shakes  hands with any who are friends, and with all men to whom he is introduced,  but with a lady only if she offers him her hand.      =HOW TO ENTER A DRAWING-ROOM=    To know how to enter a drawing-room is supposed to be one of the supreme  tests of good breeding. But there should be no more difficulty in entering  the drawing-room of Mrs. Worldly than in entering the sitting-room at  home. Perhaps the best instruction would be like that in learning to swim.  \"Take plenty of time, don't struggle and don't splash about!\" Good manners  socially are not unlike swimming--not the \"crawl\" or \"overhand,\" but  smooth, tranquil swimming. (Quite probably where the expression \"in the  swim\" came from anyway!) Before actually entering a room, it is easiest to  pause long enough to see where the hostess is. Never start forward and  then try to find her as an afterthought. The place to pause is on the  threshold--not half-way in the room. The way _not_ to enter a drawing-room  is to dart forward and then stand awkwardly bewildered and looking about  in every direction. A man of the world stops at the entrance of the room  for a scarcely perceptible moment, until he perceives the most  unencumbered approach to the hostess, and he thereupon walks over to her.  When he greets his hostess he pauses slightly, the hostess smiles and  offers her hand; the gentleman smiles and shakes hands, at the same time  bowing. A lady shakes hands with the hostess and with every one she knows  who is nearby. She bows to acquaintances at a distance and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#19)"],[1,"most casual observer, probably, not only on  account of the irregular mounds of moss-covered stones that occupied  its intervening spaces, but also, by reason of the masses of wild  flowers (great clumps of which were springing up in the crevices of  this impromptu wall) that lent to it an appearance half negligent, but  wholly and entrancingly picturesque. Here, undoubtedly, was art. That  did not astonish the young man. All avenues, in the ordinary sense,  are works of art; and the mere excess of art he saw manifested did not  surprise him; it was the character of the art that had brought him to  a standstill and held him spellbound. And the longer he looked the  more he became convinced, that whoever had superintended the  arrangement of this scenery was an artist--an artist with a scrupulous  eye for form.    The greatest care had been taken to keep the balance between neatness  and gracefulness on the one hand and picturesqueness on the other.  There were few straight lines, and no long uninterrupted ones; whilst  at no one point of view did the same effect of curvature or colour  appear twice. Variety in uniformity was the keynote.    At last tearing himself away from this one spot--where he felt he  could have spent centuries--he turned to the right and then again to  the left--for the path had now become serpentine, and at no moment  could be traced for more than two or three paces in advance. Presently  the sound of water fell gently on his ear, and in the shadiest of  diminutive forests, amidst the interlacing branches of elm and beech,  he caught the glimpse of a fountain. For an instant the wild thought  of forcing his way through it, of plunging his burning forehead in its  cooling spray, well-nigh mastered him. But his better sense conquered,  and he kept to the path. Another turn, and he caught his first glimpse  of a chimney; another--and the summit of a gable showed above the  trees. The sun, which had been hitherto obscured, now came out, and  suddenly--as if by the hand of magic--the whole scene was a brilliant  blaze of colour. He had arrived at the end of the avenue, where the  path forked; one branch turning sharply round in the direction of a  side entrance to the house, whilst the other led with a gentle  curvature to the front.    Facing the building was a broad expanse of velvety turf, relieved  occasionally, here and there, by such showy shrubs as the hydrangea,  rhododendron, or lilac; but more frequently, and at closer intervals,  by clumps of geraniums, or roses--roses of every variety. There was  nothing pretentious in the garden, any more than there was in the  adjoining edifice. Its unusually pleasing effect lay altogether in its  artistic arrangement; and one could hardly help imagining that the  whole scene had, in reality, been called into existence by the brush  of some eminent landscape painter.    The cottage itself was constructed of old-fashioned Dutch  shingles--broad and with rounded corners--and painted a dull grey; a  tint which, when contrasted with the vivid green of the tulip trees  that overshadowed the entrance to the house, and reared themselves  high above it on either side, afforded an artistic happiness perfectly  intoxicating to its present visitor. The architecture of the cottage  was--if not Early Tudor--something equally pleasing. Its roofs were  divided into many gables; its windows were diamond paned and  projecting, whilst oaken beams ran latitudinally and vertically over  its grey shingle front. Encompassing the whole base of the exterior  were masses of flowers--pinks, carnations, heliotrope, pansies,  poppies, lilies, wallflowers, roses and jasmines; and besides the  latter several other creepers had been planted beneath the walls, but  had not yet attained to any height.    Shiel Davenport, for it was he, could not resist the temptation of  peeping in at the windows; and he saw that the interior of the cottage  was artistry and simplicity itself. At the windows, curtains of heavy  white jaconet muslin, not too full, hung in sharp parallel plaits to  the floor--just to the floor. The walls were papered with French  papers of rare delicacy--to match the seasons; (spring, summer, autumn  and winter were all most effectively depicted), and the furniture  though light, was at the same time costly. And here again was the same  effect of arrangement--an arrangement obviously designed by the same  brain that had planned the building and grounds. Shiel could not  conceive anything more graceful. Flowers--flowers of every hue and  odour were the chief decoration of the cottage. On almost every table  were vases--in themselves beautiful enough--yet filled to overflowing  with the finest roses. Ox-eye daisies, hollyhocks and forget-me-nots  clustered about the open windows. And every puff of wind, every breath  of air transmitted scent--the most delicious medley of scent  imaginable.    The young man drew in deep draughts of it; he threw back his head,  and, opening his mouth, revelled in the joy of feeling it steal softly  down his throat and permeate his lungs. He was thus engaged when the  sound of a voice brought him sharply back to earth.    In the open doorway of the house, an amused expression in her violet  eyes, stood a girl--so wondrously pretty, that at the sight of her  Shiel was again overcome, and could only gaze in helpless admiration.    \"Do you want to see my father?\" she inquired. \"He is getting ready to  go out, but I daresay he will see you first.\"    \"I--I am sure he will,\" the young man replied, \"I'm Shiel Davenport.  I've come to tell him my uncle died at four o'clock this morning.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" the girl exclaimed, \"I am so sorry--sorry for you, and for  my father. I'm sure he will be terribly upset. I'm Gladys Martin,  perhaps you've heard of me--I knew your uncle.\"    \"Often,\" Shiel said, \"And I think my uncle's description of you an  excellent one.\"    \"His description of me!\"    \"Yes! he always spoke of you as the Queen of Flowers, and said you had  a mania for all things beautiful, which was not surprising, seeing how  beautiful you were yourself.\"    \"That was very nice of him,\" Gladys said, looking amused again. \"Won't  you come in? If you will wait here\"--she led him to the  drawing-room--\"I'll tell my father.\"    She disappeared, and Shiel heard her run lightly up the stairs.    \"By Jove,\" he said to himself, \"she's the loveliest girl I've ever  seen. From being so much among flowers, she has become one herself.  Violets, roses, and heliotrope have all had a share in her creation!  What eyes, what a mouth! what teeth! what hands! Surely I have found  here, not only the perfection of all things beautiful, but the  perfection of all things natural, the perfection of natural grace in  contradistinction from artificial grace. Moreover, she is a  romanticist. There is an expression of romance, of unworldliness, in  those deep-set eyes of hers, that sinks into my heart of hearts.  'Romance' and 'womanliness,' and the two terms appear to me to be  convertible, are her distinguishing features. She is an artist, an  idealist, and, over and above all--a woman! Hang it! I'm in love with  her!\"    More he could not evolve, for his meditations were abruptly cut short  by the entrance of a servant, who ushered him, straightway, into the  presence of John Martin.    The latter, though visibly affected by the news of his friend's death,  was a man of the world, and, consequently, came to business at once.  Much had to be discussed--arrangements for the funeral, the  examination of correspondence relative to the firm, and plans for the  immediate future.    \"You don't know how my uncle's affairs stand, I suppose?\" Shiel asked  somewhat nervously.    \"Yes,\" John Martin said, \"I do. May I ask if you have any private  means at all--or are you solely dependent on what you earn? By the  way, what is your calling?\"    \"I am an artist,\" Shiel said. \"No, I've nothing beyond what my uncle  was good enough to allow me.\"    \"An artist!\" John Martin murmured, \"how like Dick! Have you  entertained the idea of inheriting a fortune? Have you any reason to  suppose that your uncle was well off and had made you his heir!\"    \"I gathered so, sir, from the manner in which he lived and his  attitude towards me.\"    \"Well! we won't talk it over now--leave it till after the funeral. Are  you bent on continuing painting? There is very little remuneration in  it, is there?\"    \"Not much,\" Shiel answered gloomily, \"but I shouldn't care to give it  up--unless of course it is absolutely necessary for me to do so.\"    \"Being an artist you wouldn't be much good in business.\"    \"None!\"    \"At all events, you are candid. Well! I don't see any good in our  dallying here--I had best go back with you to Sydenham. I've got a  letter to write first, but I shan't be long.\"    He was long enough, however, for Shiel to have another chat with  Gladys. \"Do you believe in dreams?\" she asked him. \"I had such a queer  one last night, about trees and flowers; and, oddly enough, my father  also dreamed of trees and flowers, and of the very same ones too. I am  going into Town to-day to consult a firm that has just set up, called  the Modern Sorcery Company Ltd. They profess to interpret dreams, and  I am anxious to see whether they can.\"    \"In Cockspur Street, aren't they?\" Shiel asked. \"I saw their  advertisement in one of the papers. I presume you are not going there  alone?\"    \"No!\" Gladys laughed, \"I shall go with a friend, though I often do go  into Town alone. I can assure you I am quite capable of looking after  myself. In that respect, at least, I am quite up to date. Probably you  are more accustomed to French girls?\"    \"Yes! I have spent most of my life in Paris,\" Shiel said. \"But how  could you tell that?\"    \"Oh! I guessed you were an artist--and had probably spent some time in  Paris\"--Gladys rejoined, \"by the way you looked at the house and  garden. I could read"]]]
