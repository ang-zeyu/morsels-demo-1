The intermittent, irregular firing of the Boers  was punctuated by the regular, steady reports of British volleys. The  brown dust-geysers increased among the rocks where the British lay, and  soon the soldiers turned and ran for their horses. Burghers crept from  rock to rock in pursuit of them, and their bullets urged the fleeing  horsemen on. The British cannon spoke less frequently, and shells and  bullets fell so thickly around them that bravery in such a situation  seemed suicidal, and the last artilleryman fled. Boers ran up and turned  the loaded guns upon the backs of those who had operated them a few  moments before.    Down in the north-western part of the field a large force of troops was  dashing over the veld toward the banks of the spruit. Officers, waving  swords above their heads and shouting commands to their subordinates, led  the way. A few shells exploding in the ranks scattered the force  temporarily and caused horses to rear and plunge, but the gaps quickly  disappeared, and the men moved on down the slope. Boers rode rapidly down  the spruit and out upon the veld behind a low range of kopjes which lay in  front of the British force. Horses were left in charge of native servants,  and the burghers crept forward on hands and knees to the summit of the  range. They carefully concealed themselves behind rocks and bushes and  waited for the enemy to approach more closely. The cavalrymen spread out  in skirmishing order as they proceeded, and, ignorant of the proximity of  the Boers, drew their horses into a walk. The burghers in the kopje fired  a few shots, and the troops turned quickly to the left and again broke  into a gallop. The firing from the kopje increased in volume, the cannon  from the hills again broke forth, the little dust-clouds rose out of the  earth on all sides of the troopers, and shrapnel bursting in the air sent  its bolts and balls of iron and steel; into the midst of the brown men and  earth. Horses and riders fell, officers leaped to the ground and shouted  encouragement to their soldiers, men sprang behind rocks and discharged  their rifles. Minutes of agony passed. Officers gathered their men and  attempted to lead them forward, but they had not progressed far when the  Boers in the spruit in front of them swept the ground with the bullets of  their rifles. Burghers crept around the edge of the kopjes and emptied  their carbines into the backs of the cavalrymen, cannons poured shell upon  them from three different directions, and these men on the open plain  could not see even a brace of Boers to fire upon. Men and horses continued  to fall, the wounded lay moaning in the grass, while shells and bullets  sang their song of death more loudly every second to those who braved the  storm. A tiny white cloth was raised, the firing ceased instantly, and the  brave band threw down its arms to the burghers who sprang out from the  spruit and rocky kopje.    In the east the low hills were dotted with men in brown. To the right and  left of them, a thousand yards apart, were Boer horsemen circling around  kopjes and seeking positions for attacking the already vanquished but  stubborn enemy. Rifle fire had ceased and cannon sounded only at intervals  of a few minutes. Women at the doors of the two farmhouses in the centre  of the battlefield, and a man drawing water at a well near by, were not  inharmonious with the quietness and calmness of the moment, but the epoch  of peace was of short duration. The Boer horsemen stemmed the retreat of  the men in brown, and compelled them to retrace their steps. Another body  of burghers made a wide _detour_ north-eastward from the spruit, and,  jumping from their horses, crept along under the cover of an undulation in  the ground for almost a half-mile to a point which overlooked the route of  the British retreat.    The enemy was slow in coming, and a few of the Boers lay down to sleep.  Others filled their pipes and lighted them, and one abstracted a pebble  from his shoe. As the cavalrymen drew nearer to them the burghers crept  forward several paces and sought the protection of rocks or piled stones  together in the form of miniature forts. \"Shall we fire now?\" inquired a  beardless Free State youth. \"Wait until they come nearer,\" replied an  older burgher close by. Silence was maintained for several minutes, when  the youth again became uneasy. \"I can hit the first one of those Lancers,\"  he begged, as he pointed with his carbine to a cavalryman known to the  Boers as a \"Lancer,\" whether he carried a lance or not. The cannon in the  south urged the cavalrymen forward with a few shells delivered a short  distance behind them, and then the old burgher called to the youth, \"See  if you can hit him now.\"    The boy missed the rider but killed the horse, and the British force  quickly dismounted and sought shelter in a small ravine. The reports of  volley firing followed, and bullets cut the grass beside the burghers and  flattened themselves against the rocks. Another volley, and a third, in  rapid succession, and the burghers pressed more closely to the ground. An  interval of a minute, and they glanced over their tiny stockades to find a  British soldier. \"They are coming up the kopje!\" shouted a burgher, and  their rifles swept the hillside with bullets. More volleys came from below  and, while the leaden tongues sang above and around them, the burghers  turned and lay on their backs to refill the magazines of their rifles.  Another interval, and the attack was renewed. \"They are running!\" screamed  a youth exultingly, and burghers rose and fired at the men in brown at the  foot of the kopje. Marksmen had their opportunity then, and long aim was  taken before a shot was fired. Men knelt on the one knee and rested an  elbow on the other, while they held their rifles to their shoulders.  Reports of carbines became less frequent as the troops progressed farther  in an opposite direction, but increased again when the cavalrymen returned  for a second attack upon the kopje. \"Lend me a handful of cartridges, Jan,\"  asked one man of his neighbour, as they watched the oncoming force.    \"They must want this kopje,\" remarked another burgher jocularly, as he  filled his pipe with tobacco and lighted it.    The British cannon in the east again became active, and the dust raised by  their shells was blown over the heads of the burghers on the kopje. The  reports of the big guns of the Boers reverberated among the hills, while  the regular volleys of the British rifles seemed to be beating time to the  minor notes and irregular reports of the Boer carbines. At a distance the  troops moving over the brown field of battle resembled huge ants more than  human beings; and the use of smokeless powder, causing the panorama to  remain perfectly clear and distinct, allowed every movement to be closely  followed by the observer. Cannon poured forth their tons of shells, but  there was nothing except the sound of the explosion to denote where the  guns were situated. Rifles cut down lines of men, but there was no smoke  to indicate where they were being operated, and unless the burghers or  soldiers displayed themselves to their enemy there was nothing to indicate  their positions. Shrapnel bursting in the air, the reports of rifles and  heavy guns and the little puffs of dust where shells and bullets struck  the ground were the only evidences of the battle's progress. The  hand-to-hand conflicts, the duels with bayonets and swords and the clouds  of smoke were probably heroic and picturesque before the age of rapid-fire  guns, modern rifles, and smokeless ammunition, but here the field of  battle resembled a country fox-chase with an exaggerated number of  hunters, more than a representation of a battle of twenty-five years ago.    On the summit of the kopje the burghers were firing leisurely but  accurately. One man aimed steadily at a soldier for fully twenty seconds,  then pressed the trigger, lowered his rifle and watched for the effect of  the shot. Bullets were flying high over him, and the shrapnel of the  enemy's guns exploded far behind him. There seemed to be no great danger,  and he fired again. \"I missed that time,\" he remarked to a burgher who lay  behind another rock several yards distant. His neighbour then fired at the  same soldier, and both cried simultaneously: \"He is hit!\" The enemy again  disappeared in the little ravine, and the burghers ceased firing. Shells  continued to tear through the air, but none exploded in the vicinity of  the men, and they took advantage of the lull in the battle to light their  pipes. A swarm of yellow locusts passed overhead, and exploding shrapnel  tore them into myriads of pieces, their wings and limbs falling near the  burghers. \"I am glad I am not a locust,\" remarked a burgher farther to the  left of the others, as he dropped a handful of torn fragments of the  insects. Shells and bullets suddenly splashed everywhere around the  burghers, and they crouched more closely behind the rocks. The enemy's  guns had secured an accurate range, and the air was filled with the  projectiles of iron and lead. Exploding shells splintered rocks into atoms  and sent them tearing through the grass. Puffs of smoke and dirt were  springing up from every square yard of ground, and a few men rose from  their retreats and ran to the rear where the Basuto servants were holding  their horses. More followed several minutes afterwards, and when those who  remained on the summit of the kopje saw that ten times their number of  soldiers were ascending the hill under cover of cannon fire they also fled  to their horses.    An open plain half a mile wide lay between the point where the burghers  mounted their horses, and another kopje in the north-east. The men lay  closely on their horses' backs, plunged their spurs in the animals' sides,  and dashed forward. The cavalrymen, who had gained "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#19)"],[1,"called a  tiger.\"    [Footnote 129: _Les Heures; Mors; Modestie (Rimes familieres_).]    From a purely musical point of view there is some resemblance between M.  Saint-Saens and Mendelssohn. In both of them we find the same  intellectual restraint, the same balance preserved among the  heterogeneous elements of their work. These elements are not common to  both of them, because the time, the country, and the surroundings in  which they lived are not the same; and there is also a great difference  in their characters. Mendelssohn is more ingenuous and religious; M.  Saint-Saens is more of a dilettante and more sensuous. They are not so  much kindred spirits by their science as good company by a common purity  of taste, a sense of rhythm, and a genius for method, which gave all  they wrote a neo-classic character.    As for the things that directly influenced M. Saint-Saens, they are so  numerous that it would be difficult and rather bold of me to pretend to  be able to pick them out. His remarkable capacity for assimilation has  often moved him to write in the style of Wagner or Berlioz, of Haendel or  Rameau, of Lulli or Charpentier, or even of some English harpsichord or  clavichord player of the sixteenth century, like William Byrd--whose  airs are introduced quite naturally in the music of _Henry VIII_; but we  must remember that these are deliberate imitations, the amusements of a  virtuoso, about which M. Saint-Saens never deceives himself. His memory  serves him as he pleases, but he is never troubled by it.    As far as one can judge, M. Saint-Saens' musical ideas are infused with  the spirit of the great classics belonging to the end of the eighteenth  century--far more, whatever people may say, with the spirit of  Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart, than with the spirit of Bach. Schumann's  seductiveness also left its mark upon him, and he has felt the influence  of Gounod, Bizet, and Wagner. But a stronger influence was that of  Berlioz, his friend and master,[130] and, above all, that of Liszt. We  must stop at this last name.    [Footnote 130: \"Thanks to Berlioz, all my generation has been shaped,  and well shaped\" _(Portraits et Souvenirs_).]    M. Saint-Saens has good reason for liking Liszt, for Liszt was also a  lover of freedom, and had shaken off traditions and pedantry, and  scorned German routine; and he liked him, too, because his music was a  reaction from the stiff school of Brahms.[131] He was enthusiastic about  Liszt's work, and was one of the earliest and most ardent champions of  that new music of which Liszt was the leading spirit--of that  \"programme\" music which Wagner's triumph seemed to have nipped in the  bud, but which has suddenly and gloriously burst into life again in the  works of Richard Strauss. \"Liszt is one of the great composers of our  time,\" wrote M. Saint-Saens; \"he has dared more than either Weber, or  Mendelssohn, or Schubert, or Schumann. He has created the symphonic  poem. He is the deliverer of instrumental music.... He has proclaimed  the reign of free music.\"[132] This was not said impulsively in a moment  of enthusiasm; M. Saint-Saens has always held this opinion. All his life  he has remained faithful to his admiration of Liszt--since 1858, when he  dedicated a _Veni Creator_ to \"the Abbe Liszt,\" until 1886, when, a few  months after Liszt's death, he dedicated his masterpiece, the _Symphonic  avec orgue_, \"To the memory of Franz Liszt.\"[133]    [Footnote 131: \"I like Liszt's music so much, because he does not bother  about other people's opinions; he says what he wants to say; and the  only thing that he troubles about is to say it as well as he possibly  can\" (Quoted by Hippeau).]    [Footnote 132: The quotations are taken from _Harmonie et Melodie_ and  _Portraits et Souvenirs_.]    [Footnote 133: In _Harmonie et Melodie_ M. Saint-Saens tells us that he  organised and directed a concert in the Theatre-Italien where only  Liszt's compositions were played. But all his efforts to make the French  musical public appreciate Liszt were a failure.]    \"People have not hesitated to scoff at what they call my weakness for  Liszt's works. But even if the feelings of affection and gratitude that  he inspired in me did come like a prism and interpose themselves between  my eyes and his face, I do not see anything greatly to be regretted in  it.[134] I had not yet felt the charm of his personal fascination, I had  neither heard nor seen him, and I did not owe him anything at all, when  my interest was gripped in reading his first symphonic poems; and when  later they pointed the way which was to lead to _La Danse macabre_, _Le  Rouet d'Omphale_, and other works of the same nature, I am sure that my  judgment was not biassed by any prejudice in his favour, and that I  alone was responsible for what I did.\"[135]    [Footnote 134: The admiration was mutual. M. Saint-Saens even said that  without Liszt he could not have written _Samson et Dalila_. \"Not only  did Liszt have _Samson et Dalila_ performed at Weimar, but without him  that work would never have come into being. My suggestions on the  subject had met with such hostility that I had given up the idea of  writing it; and all that existed were some illegible notes.... Then at  Weimar one day I spoke to Liszt about it, and he said to me, quite  trustingly and without having heard a note, 'Finish your work; I will  have it performed here.' The events of 1870 delayed its performance for  several years.\" (_Revue Musicale_, 8 November, 1901).]    [Footnote 135: _Portraits et Souvenirs_.]    This influence seems to me to explain some of M. Saint-Saens' work. Not  only is this influence evident in his symphonic poems--some of his best  work--but it is to be found in his suites for orchestra, his fantasias,  and his rhapsodies, where the descriptive and narrative element is  strong. \"Music should charm unaided,\" said M. Saint-Saens; \"but its  effect is much finer when we use our imagination and let it flow in some  particular channel, thus imaging the music. It is then that all the  faculties of the soul are brought into play for the same end. What art  gains from this is not greater beauty, but a wider field for its  scope--that is, a greater variety of form and a larger liberty.\"[136]           *       *       *       *       *    And so we find that M. Saint-Saens has taken part in the vigorous  attempt of modern German symphony writers to bring into music some of  the power of the other arts: poetry, painting, philosophy, romance,  drama--the whole of life. But what a gulf divides them and him! A gulf  made up, not only of diversities of style, but of the difference between  two races and two worlds. Beside the frenzied outpourings of Richard  Strauss, who flounders uncertainly between mud and debris and genius,  the Latin art of Saint-Saens rises up calm and ironical. His delicacy of  touch, his careful moderation, his happy grace, \"which enters the soul  by a thousand little paths,\"[137] bring with them the pleasures of  beautiful speech and honest thought; and we cannot but feel their charm.  Compared with the restless and troubled art of to-day, his music strikes  us by its calm, its tranquil harmonies, its velvety modulations, its  crystal clearness, its smooth and flowing style, and an elegance that  cannot be put into words. Even his classic coldness does us good by its  reaction against the exaggerations, sincere as they are, of the new  school. At times one feels oneself carried back to Mendelssohn, even to  Spontini and the school of Gluck. One seems to be travelling in a  country that one knows and loves; and yet in M. Saint-Saens' works one  does not find any direct resemblance to the works of other composers;  for with no one are reminiscences rarer than with this master who  carries all the old masters in his mind--it is his spirit that is akin  to theirs. And that is the secret of his personality and his value to  us; he brings to our artistic unrest a little of the light and sweetness  of other times. His compositions are like fragments of another world.    [Footnote 136: _Harmonie et Melodie_.]    [Footnote 137: C. Saint-Saens, _Portraits et Souvenirs_.]    \"From time to time,\" he said, in speaking of _Don Giovanni_, \"in the  sacred earth of Hellene we find a fragment, an arm, the debris of a  torso, scratched and damaged by the ravages of time; it is only the  shadow of the god that the sculptor's chisel once created; but the charm  is somehow still there, the sublime style is radiant in spite of  everything.\"[138]    And so with this music. It is sometimes a little pale, a little too  restrained; but in a phrase, in a few harmonies, there will shine out a  clear vision of the past.    [Footnote 138: _Portraits et Souvenirs_.]          VINCENT D'INDY         \"I consider that criticism is useless, I would even say that it is       harmful.... Criticism generally means the opinion some man or other       holds about another person's work. How can that opinion help       forward the growth of art? It is interesting to know the ideas,       even the erroneous ideas, of geniuses and men of great talent, such       as Goethe, Schumann, Wagner, Sainte-Beuve, and Michelet, when they       wish to indulge in criticism; but it is of no interest at all to       know whether Mr. So-and-so likes, or does not like, such-and-such       dramatic or musical work.\"[139]    So writes M. Vincent d'Indy.    After such an expression of opinion one imagines that a critic ought to  feel some embarrassment in writing about M. Vincent d'Indy. And I myself  ought to be the more concerned in the matter, for in the number of the  review where the above was written the only other opinions expressed  with equal conviction belonged to the author of this book. There is only  one thing to be done--to copy M. d'Indy's example; for that forsworn  enemy of criticism is himself a keen critic.    [Footnote 139: _Revue d'Art dramatique_, "]]]
