The result of our education is to fill the mind little by little, as  experiences accrete, with a stock of such ideas. In the illustration I  used at our first meeting, of the child snatching the toy and getting  slapped, the vestiges left by the first experience answered to so many  ideas which he acquired thereby,--ideas that remained with him  associated in a certain order, and from the last one of which the child  eventually proceeded to act. The sciences of grammar and of logic are  little more than attempts methodically to classify all such acquired  ideas and to trace certain laws of relationship among them. The forms of  relation between them, becoming themselves in turn noticed by the mind,  are treated as conceptions of a higher and more abstract order, as when  we speak of a syllogistic relation' between propositions, or of four  quantities making a 'proportion,' or of the 'inconsistency' of two  conceptions, or the 'implication' of one in the other.    So you see that the process of education, taken in a large way, may be  described as nothing but the process of acquiring ideas or conceptions,  the best educated mind being the mind which has the largest stock of  them, ready to meet the largest possible variety of the emergencies of  life. The lack of education means only the failure to have acquired  them, and the consequent liability to be 'floored' and 'rattled' in the  vicissitudes of experience.    In all this process of acquiring conceptions, a certain instinctive  order is followed. There is a native tendency to assimilate certain  kinds of conception at one age, and other kinds of conception at a later  age. During the first seven or eight years of childhood the mind is most  interested in the sensible properties of material things.  _Constructiveness_ is the instinct most active; and by the incessant  hammering and sawing, and dressing and undressing dolls, putting of  things together and taking them apart, the child not only trains the  muscles to co-ordinate action, but accumulates a store of physical  conceptions which are the basis of his knowledge of the material world  through life. Object-teaching and manual training wisely extend the  sphere of this order of acquisition. Clay, wood, metals, and the various  kinds of tools are made to contribute to the store. A youth brought up  with a sufficiently broad basis of this kind is always at home in the  world. He stands within the pale. He is acquainted with Nature, and  Nature in a certain sense is acquainted with him. Whereas the youth  brought up alone at home, with no acquaintance with anything but the  printed page, is always afflicted with a certain remoteness from the  material facts of life, and a correlative insecurity of consciousness  which make of him a kind of alien on the earth in which he ought to feel  himself perfectly at home.    I already said something of this in speaking of the constructive  impulse, and I must not repeat myself. Moreover, you fully realize, I am  sure, how important for life,--for the moral tone of life, quite apart  from definite practical pursuits,--is this sense of readiness for  emergencies which a man gains through early familiarity and acquaintance  with the world of material things. To have grown up on a farm, to have  haunted a carpenter's and blacksmith's shop, to have handled horses and  cows and boats and guns, and to have ideas and abilities connected with  such objects are an inestimable part of youthful acquisition. After  adolescence it is rare to be able to get into familiar touch with any of  these primitive things. The instinctive propensions have faded, and the  habits are hard to acquire.    Accordingly, one of the best fruits of the 'child-study' movement has  been to reinstate all these activities to their proper place in a sound  system of education. _Feed_ the growing human being, feed him with the  sort of experience for which from year to year he shows a natural  craving, and he will develop in adult life a sounder sort of mental  tissue, even though he may seem to be 'wasting' a great deal of his  growing time, in the eyes of those for whom the only channels of  learning are books and verbally communicated information.    It is not till adolescence is reached that the mind grows able to take  in the more abstract aspects of experience, the hidden similarities and  distinctions between things, and especially their causal sequences.  Rational knowledge of such things as mathematics, mechanics, chemistry,  and biology, is now possible; and the acquisition of conceptions of this  order form the next phase of education. Later still, not till  adolescence is well advanced, does the mind awaken to a systematic  interest in abstract human relations--moral relations, properly so  called,--to sociological ideas and to metaphysical abstractions.    This general order of sequence is followed traditionally of course in  the schoolroom. It is foreign to my purpose to do more than indicate  that general psychological principle of the successive order of  awakening of the faculties on which the whole thing rests. I have spoken  of it already, apropos of the transitoriness of instincts. Just as many  a youth has to go permanently without an adequate stock of conceptions  of a certain order, because experiences of that order were not yielded  at the time when new curiosity was most acute, so it will conversely  happen that many another youth is spoiled for a certain subject of study  (although he would have enjoyed it well if led into it at a later age)  through having had it thrust upon him so prematurely that disgust was  created, and the bloom quite taken off from future trials. I think I  have seen college students unfitted forever for 'philosophy' from having  taken that study up a year too soon.    In all these later studies, verbal material is the vehicle by which the  mind thinks. The abstract conceptions of physics and sociology may, it  is true, be embodied in visual or other images of phenomena, but they  need not be so; and the truth remains that, after adolescence has begun,  \"words, words, words,\" must constitute a large part, and an always  larger part as life advances, of what the human being has to learn. This  is so even in the natural sciences, so far as these are causal and  rational, and not merely confined to description. So I go back to what I  said awhile ago apropos of verbal memorizing. The more accurately words  are learned, the better, if only the teacher make sure that what they  signify is also understood. It is the failure of this latter condition,  in so much of the old-fashioned recitation, that has caused that  reaction against 'parrot-like reproduction' that we are so familiar with  to-day. A friend of mine, visiting a school, was asked to examine a  young class in geography. Glancing, at the book, she said: \"Suppose you  should dig a hole in the ground, hundreds of feet deep, how should you  find it at the bottom,--warmer or colder than on top?\" None of the class  replying, the teacher said: \"I'm sure they know, but I think you don't  ask the question quite rightly. Let me try.\" So, taking the book, she  asked: \"In what condition is the interior of the globe?\" and received  the immediate answer from half the class at once: \"The interior of the  globe is in a condition of _igneous fusion_.\" Better exclusive  object-teaching than such verbal recitations as that; and yet verbal  reproduction, intelligently connected with more objective work, must  always play a leading, and surely _the_ leading, part in education. Our  modern reformers, in their books, write too exclusively of the earliest  years of the pupil. These lend themselves better to explicit treatment;  and I myself, in dwelling so much upon the native impulses, and  object-teaching, and anecdotes, and all that, have paid my tribute to  the line of least resistance in describing. Yet away back in childhood  we find the beginnings of purely intellectual curiosity, and the  intelligence of abstract terms. The object-teaching is mainly to  _launch_ the pupils, with some concrete conceptions of the facts  concerned, upon the more abstract ideas.    To hear some authorities on teaching, however, you would suppose that  geography not only began, but ended with the school-yard and neighboring  hill, that physics was one endless round of repeating the same sort of  tedious weighing and measuring operation: whereas a very few examples  are usually sufficient to set the imagination free on genuine lines, and  then what the mind craves is more rapid, general, and abstract  treatment. I heard a lady say that she had taken her child to the  kindergarten, \"but he is so bright that he saw through it immediately.\"  Too many school children 'see' as immediately 'through' the namby-pamby  attempts of the softer pedagogy to lubricate things for them, and make  them interesting. Even they can enjoy abstractions, provided they be of  the proper order; and it is a poor compliment to their rational appetite  to think that anecdotes about little Tommies and little Jennies are the  only kind of things their minds can digest.    But here, as elsewhere, it is a matter of more or less; and, in the last  resort, the teacher's own tact is the only thing that can bring out the  right effect. The great difficulty with abstractions is that of knowing  just what meaning the pupil attaches to the terms he uses. The words may  sound all right, but the meaning remains the child's own secret. So  varied forms of words must be insisted on, to bring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#19)"],[1,"also gives no indication  whatever of their having to be separated from what precedes as well as  what follows. And, in the second place, the last Sutra of the set (7)  obliges /S/a@nkara to ascribe to his truly released souls qualities  which clearly cannot belong to them; so that he finally is obliged to  make the extraordinary statement that those qualities belong to them  'vyavaharapekshaya,' while yet the purport of the whole adhikara/n/a is  said to be the description of the truly released soul for which no  vyavahara exists! Very truly /S/a@nkara's commentator here remarks,  'atra ke/k/in muhyanti akha/n/da/k/inmatrajanan muktasyajnanabhavat kuta  aj/n/anika-dharmayoga/h/,' and the way in which thereupon he himself  attempts to get over the difficulty certainly does not improve matters.    In connexion with the two passages discussed, we meet in the fourth  adhyaya with another passage, which indeed has no direct bearing on the  distinction of apara and para vidya, but may yet be shortly referred to  in this place as another and altogether undoubted instance of  /S/a@nkara's interpretations not always agreeing with the text of the  Sutras. The Sutras 7-16 of the third pada state the opinions of three  different teachers on the question to which Brahman the soul of the  vidvan repairs on death, or--according to Ramanuja--the worshippers of  which Brahman repair to (the highest) Brahman. Ramanuja treats the views  of Badari and Jaimini as two purvapakshas, and the opinion of  Badaraya/n/a--which is stated last--as the siddhanta. /S/a@nkara, on the  other hand, detaching the Sutras in which Badaraya/n/a's view is set  forth from the preceding part of the adhikara/n/a (a proceeding which,  although not plausible, yet cannot be said to be altogether  illegitimate), maintains that Badari's view, which is expounded first,  represents the siddhanta, while Jaimini's view, set forth subsequently,  is to be considered a mere purvapaksha. This, of course, is altogether  inadmissible, it being the invariable practice of the Vedanta-sutras as  well as the Purva Mima/m/sa-sutras to conclude the discussion of  contested points with the statement of that view which is to be accepted  as the authoritative one. This is so patent that /S/a@nkara feels  himself called upon to defend his deviation from the general rule  (Commentary on IV, 4, 13), without, however, bringing forward any  arguments but such as are valid only if /S/a@nkara's system itself is  already accepted.    The previous considerations leave us, I am inclined to think, no choice  but to side with Ramanuja as to the general subject-matter of the fourth  adhyaya of the Sutras. We need not accept him as our guide in all  particular interpretations, but we must acknowledge with him that the  Sutras of the fourth adhyaya describe the ultimate fate of one and the  same vidvan, and do not afford any basis for the distinction of a higher  and lower knowledge of Brahman in /S/a@nkara's sense.    If we have not to discriminate between a lower and a higher knowledge of  Brahman, it follows that the distinction of a lower and a higher Brahman  is likewise not valid. But this is not a point to be decided at once on  the negative evidence of the fourth adhyaya, but regarding which the  entire body of the Vedanta-sutras has to be consulted. And intimately  connected with this investigation--in fact, one with it from a certain  point of view--is the question whether the Sutras afford any evidence of  their author having held the doctrine of Maya, the principle of  illusion, by the association with which the highest Brahman, in itself  transcending all qualities, appears as the lower Brahman or I/s/vara.  That Ramanuja denies the distinction of the two Brahmans and the  doctrine of Maya we have seen above; we shall, however, in the  subsequent investigation, pay less attention to his views and  interpretations than to the indications furnished by the Sutras  themselves.    Placing myself at the point of view of a /S/a@nkara, I am startled at  the outset by the second Sutra of the first adhyaya, which undertakes to  give a definition of Brahman. 'Brahman is that whence the origination  and so on (i.e. the sustentation and reabsorption) of this world  proceed.' What, we must ask, is this Sutra meant to define?--That  Brahman, we are inclined to answer, whose cognition the first Sutra  declares to constitute the task of the entire Vedanta; that Brahman  whose cognition is the only road to final release; that Brahman in fact  which /S/a@nkara calls the highest.--But, here we must object to  ourselves, the highest Brahman is not properly defined as that from  which the world originates. In later Vedantic writings, whose authors  were clearly conscious of the distinction of the higher absolute Brahman  and the lower Brahman related to Maya or the world, we meet with  definitions of Brahman of an altogether different type. I need only  remind the reader of the current definition of Brahman as  sa/k/-/k/id-ananda, or, to mention one individual instance, refer to the  introductory /s/lokas of the Pa/nk/ada/s/i dilating on the sa/m/vid  svayam-prabha, the self-luminous principle of thought which in all time,  past or future, neither starts into being nor perishes (P.D. I, 7).  'That from which the world proceeds' can by a /S/a@nkara be accepted  only as a definition of I/s/vara, of Brahman which by its association  with Maya is enabled to project the false appearance of this world, and  it certainly is as improbable that the Sutras should open with a  definition of that inferior principle, from whose cognition there can  accrue no permanent benefit, as, according to a remark made above, it is  unlikely that they should conclude with a description of the state of  those who know the lower Brahman only, and thus are debarred from  obtaining true release. As soon, on the other hand, as we discard the  idea of a twofold Brahman and conceive Brahman as one only, as the  all-enfolding being which sometimes emits the world from its own  substance and sometimes again retracts it into itself, ever remaining  one in all its various manifestations--a conception which need not by  any means be modelled in all its details on the views of the  Ramanujas--the definition of Brahman given in the second Sutra becomes  altogether unobjectionable.    We next enquire whether the impression left on the mind by the manner in  which Badaraya/n/a defines Brahman, viz. that he does not distinguish  between an absolute Brahman and a Brahman associated with Maya, is  confirmed or weakened by any other parts of his work. The Sutras being  throughout far from direct in their enunciations, we shall have to look  less to particular terms and turns of expression than to general lines  of reasoning. What in this connexion seems specially worthy of being  taken into account, is the style of argumentation employed by the  Sutrakara against the Sa@nkhya doctrine, which maintains that the world  has originated, not from an intelligent being, but from the  non-intelligent pradhana. The most important Sutras relative to this  point are to be met with in the first pada of the second adhyaya. Those  Sutras are indeed almost unintelligible if taken by themselves, but the  unanimity of the commentators as to their meaning enables us to use them  as steps in our investigation. The sixth Sutra of the pada mentioned  replies to the Sa@nkhya objection that the non-intelligent world cannot  spring from an intelligent principle, by the remark that 'it is thus  seen,' i.e. it is a matter of common observation that non-intelligent  things are produced from beings endowed with intelligence; hair and  nails, for instance, springing from animals, and certain insects from  dung.--Now, an argumentation of this kind is altogether out of place  from the point of view of the true /S/a@nkara. According to the latter  the non-intelligent world does not spring from Brahman in so far as the  latter is intelligence, but in so far as it is associated with Maya.  Maya is the upadana of the material world, and Maya itself is of a  non-intelligent nature, owing to which it is by so many Vedantic writers  identified with the prak/ri/ti of the Sa@nkhyas. Similarly the  illustrative instances, adduced under Sutra 9 for the purpose of showing  that effects when being reabsorbed into their causal substances do not  impart to the latter their own qualities, and that hence the material  world also, when being refunded into Brahman, does not impart to it its  own imperfections, are singularly inappropriate if viewed in connexion  with the doctrine of Maya, according to which the material world is no  more in Brahman at the time of a pralaya than during the period of its  subsistence. According to /S/a@nkara the world is not merged in Brahman,  but the special forms into which the upadana of the world, i.e. Maya,  had modified itself are merged in non-distinct Maya, whose relation to  Brahman is not changed thereby.--The illustration, again, given in Sutra  24 of the mode in which Brahman, by means of its inherent power,  transforms itself into the world without employing any extraneous  instruments of action, 'kshiravad dhi,' 'as milk (of its own accord  turns into curds),' would be strangely chosen indeed if meant to bring  nearer to our understanding the mode in which Brahman projects the  illusive appearance of the world; and also the analogous instance given  in the Sutra next following, 'as Gods and the like (create palaces,  chariots, &c. by the mere power of their will)'--which refers to the  real creation of real things--would hardly be in its place if meant to  illustrate a theory which considers unreality to be the true character  of the world. The mere cumulation of the two essentially heterogeneous  illustrative instances (kshiravad dhi; devadivat), moreover, seems to  show that the writer who had recourse to them held no very definite"]]]
