When you begin to grow old always think  deeply of your youth, for an old man without memories is a wasted life,  and nothing is worth remembering but our childhood. I will tell you some  of the differences between being old and young, and then you can ask me  questions, and so we will get at both sides of the matter. First, an old  man gets tired quicker than a boy.\"    The boy thought for a moment, and then replied:    \"That is not a great difference, for a boy does get very tired.\"    The Philosopher continued:    \"An old man does not want to eat as often as a boy.\"    \"That is not a great difference either,\" the boy replied, \"for they both  do eat. Tell me the big difference.\"    \"I do not know it, my son; but I have always thought there was a big  difference. Perhaps it is that an old man has memories of things which a  boy cannot even guess at.\"    \"But they both have memories,\" said the boy, laughing, \"and so it is not  a big difference.\"    \"That is true,\" said the Philosopher. \"Maybe there is not so much  difference after all. Tell me things you do, and we will see if I can do  them also.\"    \"But I don't know what I do,\" he replied.    \"You must know the things you do,\" said the Philosopher, \"but you may  not understand how to put them in order. The great trouble about any  kind of examination is to know where to begin, but there are always two  places in everything with which we can commence--they are the beginning  and the end. From either of these points a view may be had which  comprehends the entire period. So we will begin with the things you did  this morning.\"    \"I am satisfied with that,\" said the boy.    The Philosopher then continued:    \"When you awakened this morning and went out of the house what was the  first thing you did?\"    The boy thought \"I went out, then I picked up a stone and threw it into  the field as far as I could.\"    \"What then?\" said the Philosopher.    \"Then I ran after the stone to see could I catch up on it before it hit  the ground.\"    \"Yes,\" said the Philosopher.    \"I ran so fast that I tumbled over myself into the grass.\"    \"What did you do after that?\"    \"I lay where I fell and plucked handfuls of the grass with both hands  and threw them on my back.\"    \"Did you get up then?\"    \"No, I pressed my face into the grass and shouted a lot of times with my  mouth against the ground, and then I sat up and did not move for a long  time.\"    \"Were you thinking?\" said the Philosopher.    \"No, I was not thinking or doing anything.\"    \"Why did you do all these things?\" said the Philosopher.    \"For no reason at all,\" said the boy.    \"That,\" said the Philosopher triumphantly, \"is the difference between  age and youth. Boys do things for no reason, and old people do not.  I wonder do we get old because we do things by reason instead of  instinct?\"    \"I don't know,\" said the boy, \"everything gets old. Have you travelled  very far to-day, sir?\"    \"I will tell you that if you will tell me your name.\"    \"My name,\" said the boy, \"is MacCushin.\"    \"When I came last night,\" said the Philosopher, \"from the place of Angus  Og in the Caste of the Sleepers I was bidden say to one named MacCushin  that a son would be born to Angus Og and his wife, Caitilin, and that  the sleepers of Erinn had turned in their slumbers.\"    The boy regarded him steadfastly.    \"I know,\" said he, \"why Angus Og sent me that message. He wants me to  make a poem to the people of Erinn, so that when the Sleepers arise they  will meet with friends.\"    \"The Sleepers have arisen,\" said the Philosopher. \"They are about us on  every side. They are walking now, but they have forgotten their names  and the meanings of their names. You are to tell them their names and  their lineage, for I am an old man, and my work is done.\"    \"I will make a poem some day,\" said the boy, \"and every man will shout  when he hears it.\"    \"God be with you, my son,\" said the Philosopher, and he embraced the boy  and went forward on his journey.    About half an hour's easy travelling brought him to a point from which  he could see far down below to the pine trees of Coille Doraca. The  shadowy evening had crept over the world ere he reached the wood, and  when he entered the little house the darkness had already descended.    The Thin Woman of Inis Magrath met him as he entered, and was about to  speak harshly of his long absence, but the Philosopher kissed her with  such unaccustomed tenderness, and spoke so mildly to her, that, first,  astonishment enchained her tongue, and then delight set it free in a  direction to which it had long been a stranger.    \"Wife,\" said the Philosopher, \"I cannot say how joyful I am to see your  good face again.\"    The Thin Woman was unable at first to reply to this salutation, but,  with incredible speed, she put on a pot of stirabout, began to bake a  cake, and tried to roast potatoes. After a little while she wept loudly,  and proclaimed that the world did not contain the equal of her husband  for comeliness and goodness, and that she was herself a sinful person  unworthy of the kindness of the gods or of such a mate.    But while the Philosopher was embracing Seumas and Brigid Beg, the door  was suddenly burst open with a great noise, four policemen entered the  little room, and after one dumbfoundered minute they retreated again  bearing the Philosopher with them to answer a charge of murder.          BOOK V. THE POLICEMEN        CHAPTER XIV    SOME distance down the road the policemen halted. The night had fallen  before they effected their capture, and now, in the gathering darkness,  they were not at ease. In the first place, they knew that the occupation  upon which they were employed was not a creditable one to a man whatever  it might be to a policeman. The seizure of a criminal may be justified  by certain arguments as to the health of society and the preservation  of property, but no person wishes under any circumstances to hale a wise  man to prison. They were further distressed by the knowledge that they  were in the very centre of a populous fairy country, and that on every  side the elemental hosts might be ranging, ready to fall upon them with  the terrors of war or the still more awful scourge of their humour.  The path leading to their station was a long one, winding through great  alleys of trees, which in some places overhung the road so thickly that  even the full moon could not search out that deep blackness. In the  daylight these men would have arrested an Archangel and, if necessary,  bludgeoned him, but in the night-time a thousand fears afflicted and a  multitude of sounds shocked them from every quarter.    Two men were holding the Philosopher, one on either side; the other two  walked one before and one behind him. In this order they were proceeding  when just in front through the dim light they saw the road swallowed  up by one of these groves already spoken of. When they came nigh they  halted irresolutely: the man who was in front (a silent and perturbed  sergeant) turned fiercely to the others \"Come on, can't you?\" said he;  \"what the devil are you waiting for?\" and he strode forward into the  black gape.    \"Keep a good hold of that man,\" said the one behind.    \"Don't be talking out of you,\" replied he on the right. \"Haven't we got  a good grip of him, and isn't he an old man into the bargain?\"    \"Well, keep a good tight grip of him, anyhow, for if he gave you the  slip in there he'd vanish like a weasel in a bush. Them old fellows do  be slippery customers. Look here, mister,\" said he to the Philosopher,  \"if you try to run away from us I'll give you a clout on the head with  my baton; do you mind me now!\"    They had taken only a few paces forward when the sound of hasty  footsteps brought them again to a halt, and in a moment the sergeant  came striding back. He was angry.    \"Are you going to stay there the whole night, or what are you going to  do at all?\" said he.    \"Let you be quiet now,\" said another; \"we were only settling with the  man here the way he wouldn't try to give us the slip in a dark place.\"    \"Is it thinking of giving us the slip he is?\" said the sergeant. \"Take  your baton in your hand, Shawn, and if he turns his head to one side of  him hit him on that side.\"    \"I'll do that,\" said Shawn, and he pulled out his truncheon.    The Philosopher had been dazed by the suddenness of these occurrences,  and the enforced rapidity of his movements prevented him from either  thinking or speaking, but during this brief stoppage his scattered  wits began to return to their allegiance. First, bewilderment at his  enforcement had seized him, and the four men, who were continually  running round him and speaking all at once, and each pulling him in a  different direction, gave him the impression that he was surrounded by  a great rabble of people, but he could not discover what they wanted.  After a time he found that there were only four men, and gathered from  their remarks that he was being arrested for murder--this precipitated  him into another and a deeper gulf of bewilderment. He was unable to  conceive why they should arrest him for murder when he had not committed  any; and, following this, he became indignant.    \"I will not go another step,\" said he, \"unless you tell me where you are  bringing me and what I am accused of.\"    \"Tell me,\" said the sergeant, \"what did you kill them with? for it's a  miracle how they came to their ends without as much as a mark on their  skins or a broken tooth itself.\"    \"Who are you talking about?\" the Philosopher demanded.    \"It's mighty innocent you are,\" he replied. \"Who would I be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#19)"],[1,"que me pedia;        Yo entendi que era una rosa,        Pero el dijo que era otra cosa,        Que yo no le quise dar.          ?Sabe usted lo que decia  15    El taimado que queria?
