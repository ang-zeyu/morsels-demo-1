(#19)"],[1,"in his writings, it  rouses indignation, in one class at least of his readers, to see him by  such a mode of arguing reaching conclusions which are subversive of the  fundamental truths of religion.    3. Another fact cannot fail to attract attention. When the theory of  evolution was propounded in 1844 in the \"Vestiges of Creation,\" it was  universally rejected; when proposed by Mr. Darwin, less than twenty  years afterward, it was received with acclamation. Why is this? The  facts are now what they were then. They were as well known then as they  are now. The theory, so far as evolution is concerned, was then just  what it is now. How then is it, that what was scientifically false in  1844 is scientifically true in 1864? When a drama is introduced in a  theatre and universally condemned, and a little while afterward, with a  little change in the scenery, it is received with rapturous applause,  the natural conclusion is, that the change is in the audience and not in  the drama.    There is only one cause for the fact referred to, that we can think of.  The \"Vestiges of Creation\" did not expressly or effectually exclude  design. Darwin does. This is a reason assigned by the most zealous  advocates of his theory for their adoption of it. This is the reason  given by Buechner, by Haeckel, and by Vogt. It is assigned also in  express terms by Strauss, the announcement of whose death has diffused a  feeling of sadness over all who were acquainted with his antecedents. In  his last work, \"The Old Faith and the New,\" he admits \"that Darwin's  doctrine is a mere hypothesis; that it leaves the main points  unexplained (Die Hupt und Cardinal-punkte noch unerklaert sind);  nevertheless, as he has shown how miracles may be excluded, he is to be  applauded as one of the greatest benefactors of the human race.\" (p.  177) By \"Wunder,\" or miracle, Strauss means any event for which natural  causes are insufficient to account. \"We philosophers and critical  theologians,\" he says, \"have spoken well when we decreed the abolition  of miracles; but our decree (macht-spruch) remained without effect,  because we could not show them to be unnecessary, inasmuch as we were  unable to indicate any natural force to take their place. Darwin has  provided or indicated this natural force, this process of nature; he has  opened the door through which a happier posterity may eject miracles  forever.\" Then follows the sentence just quoted, \"He who knows what  hangs on miracle, will applaud Darwin as one of the greatest benefactors  of the human race.\" With Strauss and others of his class, miracles and  design are identical, because one as well as the other assumes  supernatural agency. He quotes Helmholtz, who says, \"Darwin's theory,  that adaptation in the formation of organisms may arise without the  intervention of intelligence, by the blind operation of natural law;\"  and then adds, \"As Helmholtz distinguishes the English naturalist as the  man who has banished design from nature, so we have praised him as the  man who has done away with miracles. Both mean the same thing.[47]  Design is the miracle-worker in nature, which has put the world upside  down; or as Spinoza says, has placed the last first, the effect for the  cause, and thus destroyed the very idea of nature. Design in nature,  especially in the department of living organisms, has ever been appealed  to by those who desire to prove that the world is not self-evolved, but  the work of an intelligent Creator.\" (p. 211) On page 175, he refers to  those who ridicule Darwin, and yet are so far under the influence of the  spirit of the age as to deny miracles or the intervention of the Creator  in the course of nature, and says: \"Very well; how do they account for  the origin of man, and in general the development of the organic out of  the inorganic? Would they assume that the original man as such, no  matter how rough and unformed, but still a man, sprang immediately out  of the inorganic, out of the sea or the slime of the Nile? They would  hardly venture to say that; then they must know that there is only the  choice between miracle, the divine hand of the Creator, and Darwin.\"  What an alternative; the Creator or Darwin! In this, however, Strauss is  right. To banish design from nature, as is done by Darwin's theory, is,  in the language of the Rev. Walter Mitchell, virtually \"to dethrone the  Creator.\"    Ludwig Weis, M. D., of Darmstadt, says it is at present \"the mode\" in  Germany (and of course in a measure here), to glorify Buddhism.  Strauss, he adds, says, \"Nature knows itself in man, and in that he  expresses the thought which all Idealism and all Materialism make the  grand end. To the same effect it is said, 'In Man the All comprehends  itself as conscious being (comes to self-consciousness); or, in Man the  absolute knowledge (Wissen, the act of knowing) appears in the limits of  personality.' This was the doctrine of the Buddhist and of the ancient  Chinese.\" Thus, as Dr. Weis says, \"in the nineteenth century of the  Christian era, philosophers and scientists have reached the point where  the Chinese were two thousand years ago.\"    The only way that is apparent for accounting for evolution being  rejected in 1844, and for its becoming a popular doctrine in 1866, is,  that it happens to suit a prevailing state of mind. It is a fact, so far  as our limited knowledge extends, that no one is willing to acknowledge  himself, not simply an evolutionist, but an evolutionist of the  Darwinian school, who is not either a Materialist by profession, or a  disciple of Herbert Spencer, or an advocate of the philosophy of Hume.    There is another significant fact which goes to prove that the denial  of design, which is the \"creative idea\" of Darwinism, is the main cause  of its popularity and success. Professor Owen, England's greatest  naturalist, is a derivationist. Derivation and evolution are convertible  terms. Both include the denial that species are primordial, or have each  a different origin; and both imply that one species is formed out of  another and simpler form. Professor Owen, however, although a  derivationist, or evolutionist, is a very strenuous anti-Darwinian. He  differs from Darwin as to two points. First, as to Natural Selection, or  the Survival of the Fittest. He says that is inconsistent with facts and  utterly insufficient to account for the origin of species. He refers the  origin of species to an inherent tendency to change impressed on them  from the beginning. And second, he admits design. He denies that the  succession and origin of species are due to chance, and expresses his  belief in the constant operation of creative power in the formation of  species from the varied descendants of more generalized forms.[48] He  believes \"that all living things have been produced by such law (of  variation) in time, their position and uses in the world having been  preordained by the Creator.\"[49] Professor Owen says he has taught the  doctrine of derivation (evolution) for thirty years, but it attracted  little attention. As soon, however, as Darwin leaves out design, we have  a prairie-fire. A prairie-fire, happily, does not continue very long;  and while it lasts, it burns up little else than stubble.    4. All the evidence we have in favor of the fixedness of species is, of  course, evidence not only against Darwinism, but against evolution in  all its forms. It would seem idle to discuss the question of the  mutability of species, until satisfied what species is. This, unhappily,  is a question which it is exceedingly difficult to answer. Not only do  the definitions given by scientific men differ almost indefinitely, but  there is endless diversity in classification. Think of four hundred and  eighty species of humming-birds. Haeckel says that one naturalist makes  ten, another forty, another two hundred, and another one, species of a  certain fossil; and we have just heard that Agassiz had collected eight  hundred species of the same fossil animal. Haeckel also says (p. 246),  that there are no two zooelogists or any two botanists who agree  altogether in their classification. Mr. Darwin says, \"No clear line of  demarcation has yet been drawn between species and sub-species, and  varieties.\" (p. 61) It is absolutely necessary, therefore, that a  distinction should be made between artificial and natural species. No  man asserts the immutability of all those varieties of plants and  animals, which naturalists, for the convenience of classification, may  call distinct species. Haeckel, for example, gives a list of twelve  species of man. So any one may make fifty species of dogs, or of horses.  This is a mere artificial distinction, which amounts to nothing. There  is far greater difference between a pouter and a carrier pigeon, than  between a Caucasian and a Mongolian. To call the former varieties of the  same species, and the latter distinct species, is altogether arbitrary.  Nevertheless, notwithstanding the arbitrary classifications of  naturalists, it remains true that there are what Professor Dana calls  \"units\" of the organic world. \"When individuals multiply from generation  to generation, it is but a repetition of the primordial type-idea, and  the true notion of the species is not in the resulting group, but in  the idea or potential element which is the basis of every individual of  the group.\"[50] Dr. Morton's definition of species as \"primordial  organic forms,\" agrees with that given by Professor Dana; and both agree  with the Bible, which says that God created plants and animals each  after its kind. A primordial form is a form which was not evolved out of  some other form, but which began to be in the form--subject to such  varieties as we see in the dog, horse, and man--in which it continued  during the whole period of its existence.    The criteria of these primordial forms or species of nature, are, (1.)  Morphological.

However, we will let them march.    \"Send word, to the company which lies somewhat in the line which  they have taken, of their approach; and let them at once retire.  Tell them to make circuits in the hills, but to leave behind them  sufficient traces for the Spaniards to follow. This will encourage  them to keep on, and by nightfall they will be thoroughly tired  out.    \"Whenever they get in valleys, or other places where advantage may  be taken of them, two of the companies shall accompany them, at a  good distance on their flanks; and pour in volleys of arrows, or  roll stones down upon them. I will take command of one of these  companies, Gerald of the other.    \"Do you,\" he said to the negro, \"follow with the last. Keep out of  their reach; but occasionally, after they have passed, fire arrows  among the rear guard.    \"Do you, cacique, make your way to the leading column. See that  they choose the most difficult gorges; and give, as far as  possible, the appearance of hurry to their flight, so as to  encourage the Spaniards to follow.\"    These tactics were faithfully carried out. All day the Spaniards  followed, as they believed, close upon the footsteps of the flying  foe; but from time to time, from strong advantage spots, arrows  were rained upon them, great rocks thundered down, and wild yells  rang through the forest. Before, however, they could ascend the  slopes and get hand to hand with their enemy, these had retreated,  and all was silent as the grave in the woods.    Perplexed, harassed, and somewhat awe-struck by these new and  inexplicable tactics; and having lost many men, by the arrows and  stones of the enemy, the two troops gathered at nightfall in an  open glade. Here a bivouac was formed, branches of the trees cut  down, and the provisions which each had brought with him produced.  A rivulet ran through the glade, and the weary troops were soon  lying on the grass, a strong line of sentries having been placed  round.    Already the appearance of the troop was greatly changed from that  of the body which had entered the wood. Then all were eager for the  fray; confident in the extreme of their power to crush, with ease,  these unarmed negroes and natives, who had hitherto, except on the  last occasion, fled like hunted deer at their approach. Now,  however, this feeling was checked. They had learned that the enemy  were well commanded, and prepared; and that so far, while they  themselves had lost several men, not a native had been so much as  seen by them.    At nightfall the air became alive with mysterious noises; cries as  of animals, occasionally Indian whoops, shouts from one voice to  another were heard all around. The Spaniards stood to their arms,  and gazed anxiously into the darkness.    Soon the shouts of the sentries told that flights of arrows were  being discharged at them, by invisible foes. Volley after volley  were fired, from the musketoons and arquebuses, into the wood.  These were answered by bursts of taunting laughter, and mocking  yells, while the rain of arrows continued.    The Spanish troops, whose position and figures could be seen by the  blaze of the lighted fires, while a dense darkness reigned within  the forest, began to suffer severely from the arrows of these  unseen foes. Bodies, fifty strong, advanced into the dark forest to  search out their enemies; but they searched in vain. The Indians,  better accustomed to the darkness, and knowing the forest well,  easily retreated as they advanced; and the Spaniards dared not  venture far from their fires, for they feared being lost in the  forest.    The officer commanding, an old and experienced soldier, soon ceased  these useless sorties. Calling his men into the center of the  glade; he ordered them to stand in readiness to repel an assault,  extinguished every fire, and allowed half the troop at once to lie  down, to endeavor to snatch some sleep. This, however, was  impossible; for although the Indians did not venture upon an  attack, the chorus of shouts and yells was so terrible and  continuous, and the flights of arrows at times fell so fast, that  not one of the troop ventured to close an eye.    From time to time volleys were fired into the darkness; and once or  twice a loud cry told that some, at least, of the balls had taken  effect; but the opponents, sheltered each behind the trunk of a  tree, suffered comparatively slightly, while many of the Spaniards  were struck by their missiles.    Morning dawned upon a worn-out and dispirited band, but with  daylight their hopes revived. Vigorous sorties were made into the  wood; and though these discovered, in a few places, marks of blood  where some of their enemies had fallen, and signs of a party being  carried away, the woods were now as deserted as they had appeared  to be on the previous evening, when they first halted.    There was a consultation among the leaders, and it was determined  to abandon the pursuit of these invisible foes, as it was agreed  that nothing, short of a great effort by the whole available force  of the island, would be sufficient to cope with a foe whose tactics  were so bewildering and formidable.    Upon their march out from the wood, the troop was pursued with the  same persistence with which it had been dogged on the preceding  day; and when at length it emerged, and the captain counted the  numbers of his men, it was found that there were no less than  thirty wounded, and that twenty had been left behind, dead.    The dwellers of the wood were overjoyed with their success, and  felt that a new existence had opened before them. Hitherto they had  been fugitives only, and no thought of resistance to the Spaniards  had ever entered their minds. They felt now that, so long as they  remained in the woods, and maintained their drill and discipline,  and persisted in the tactics which they had adopted, they could  defy the Spaniards; unless, indeed, the latter came in overwhelming  strength.    Some time elapsed before any fresh effort was made by the  Spaniards. The affair caused intense excitement in the city, and it  is difficult to say whether alarm, or rage, most predominated. It  was felt that a great effort must be made, to crush the men of the  forest; for unless this were done, a vast number of the negro  slaves would escape and join them, and the movement would become  more formidable, every day.    Upon the part of those in the forest, great consultations took  place. Some of the negroes were for sending messages to the slaves  to rise and join them, but Ned and Gerald strongly opposed this  course. There were, as they pointed out, no means whatever in the  forest for supporting a larger body of men than those gathered  there. The tree-clad hills which constituted their stronghold were  some thirty miles in diameter; and the supply of fruits, of roots,  and of birds were sufficient for their wants; but it would be very  different, were their numbers largely increased. Then they would be  forced to make raids upon the cultivated ground beyond; and here,  however strong, they would be no match for the Spaniards, whose  superior arms and discipline would be certain to give them victory.    The Indians strongly supported the reasoning of the boys, and the  negroes, when they fully understood the difficulties which would  arise, finally acquiesced in their arguments.    Schemes were broached for making sallies from the forest, at night,  and falling upon the plantations of the Spaniards. This offered  greater chances of success, but the boys foresaw that all sorts of  atrocities would be sure to take place, and that no quarter would  be given to Spaniards of either age or sex. They therefore combated  vigorously this proposal, also. They pointed out that, so long as  they remained quiet in the forest, and were not joined by large  numbers of fugitive negroes, the Spaniards might be content to let  them remain unmolested; but upon the contrary, were they to adopt  offensive tactics, not only would every Spaniard in the island take  up arms against them, but if necessary they would send for help to  the neighboring islands, and would assemble a force sufficient  thoroughly to search the woods, and to annihilate them.    The only case in which the boys considered that an attack upon the  Spaniards would be lawful, would be in the event of fresh  expeditions being organized. In that case, they were of opinion  that it would be useful to destroy one or two large mansions and  plantations, as near as possible to the town; sending at the same  time a message to the Spaniards that, if they persisted in  disturbing them in the forest, a similar fate would befall every  Spanish plantation situated beyond the town.    It was not long before these tactics were called into play. One of  the negroes had, as was their custom, gone down to the town, to  purchase such articles as were indispensable. Upon these occasions,  as usual, he went down to the hut of the old woman who acted as  their intermediary; and remained concealed there, during the day,  while she went into the town, to buy cotton for dresses, and other  things. This she could only do in small quantities at a time, using  various shops for the purpose; returning each time, with her  parcel, to the hut.    The suspicion of the Spaniards had, however, been aroused; and  orders had been given to watch her closely. The consequence was  that, after purchasing a few articles, she was followed; and a band  of soldiers surrounded the hut, after she had entered. The fugitive  was there found concealed, and he and the old woman were at once  fastened in the hut. This was then set alight, and they were burned  to death, upon the spot.    When the news reached the mountains, Ned at once determined upon a  reprisal. The negroes and"]]]
