The Peacock turned his head so that they could see it more plainly.  \"That is a crest to be proud of,\" he said. \"I have never seen a finer  one myself. Have you noticed the beauty of my neck?\"    \"Charming!\" \"Wonderful!\" \"Beautiful!\" exclaimed the young fowls. Just  then one of the spoiled Dove children flew down from the barn roof and  sat beside the Peacock.    \"What homely feet you have!\" this Squab exclaimed. \"Are you not  dreadfully ashamed of them?\"    The young fowls thought this rude. Not one of them would have said it.  The Peacock became very angry. \"I know my feet are not so handsome as  they might be,\" he said, \"but that is no reason why I should be ashamed  of them. I couldn't help having that kind of feet. They run in my  family. I don't feel ashamed of things I can't help.\"    The young fowls felt so uncomfortable after this that they walked away,  and the Squab flew back to the Dove-cote. For a time nobody spoke. Then  a Gosling, who had heard her mother talk about the Peacock, said, \"I  should think he would be proud of his train, and his crest, and his  neck, and--and everything!\"    \"Everything except his feet,\" giggled the Bantam Chicken, \"and you know  he couldn't help having them.\"    \"I wonder if he could help having his train, and his crest, and his  neck, and--and everything?\" said a young Turkey.    They all stopped where they were. \"We never thought of that!\" they  cried. \"We never thought of that!\"    \"Let's go and ask the Blind Horse,\" said a Duckling. \"He is a good  friend of mine, and he knows almost everything.\"    They stalked and waddled over to the Blind Horse, and the Duckling told  him what was puzzling them. The Blind Horse laughed very heartily. \"So  the Peacock is proud of having grown such a fine train and crest, but he  isn't ashamed of his homely feet, because he couldn't help having  those! There is no reason for either pride or shame with the Peacock. He  has just such a body as was given him, and he couldn't make one feather  grow differently if he tried.\"    \"I don't see what anybody can be proud of, then,\" said a Gosling sadly;  for, you see, she wanted to be proud of something.    \"Be proud of what you have done yourself,\" said the Blind Horse gently.  \"Be proud of keeping clean, or of telling the truth, or of speaking  pleasantly when things go wrong. There are plenty of chances to be proud  in a good way, if one must be proud.\"          THE DISCONTENTED GUINEA HEN      \"Well,\" said the Gobbler, \"I should like to know what next! Last spring  it was the White Pig, when we had never had any but black and brown ones  on the place. Next it was Ducks, because one of the farmer's boys wanted  them. Then it was the Peacock, to please the farmer's wife. Now it is  Guinea Fowls for the farmer's other son. Society isn't what it used to  be here, and while some of the new people may be very pleasant, I must  say that I preferred the good old quiet days.\"    \"I think it is lovely,\" cackled the cheerful little Bantam Hen. \"One  hears so much of the world outside, and for people like myself, who  stay at home, that is a good thing. Everybody loved the White Pig before  she had been here two days, and my children are very fond of the  Ducklings. I like to have them together, too, for after I had told them  positively that my Chickens could not go in swimming, they stopped  teasing and became most delightful playmates.\"    \"What would you say about the Peacock?\" asked the Shanghai Cock, who had  never been friendly with him, although, to tell the truth, the Shanghai  Cock was not so grumpy as he used to be.    \"Er--er--well,\" said the Bantam Hen, who tried not to say unpleasant  things about people unless she really had to, \"he--he is certainly  beautiful, although I can't say that I am fond of hearing him sing.\"    This made all the fowls laugh, even the Gobbler looking a little smiling  around the beak on the side where his hanging wattle did not hide his  face. When the Hen Turkeys on the smiling side saw that he was pleased,  they began to smile too; and then the Hen Turkeys on the other side, who  hadn't been sure that it was safe for them to do so, smiled also. And it  did them all a great deal of good.    \"I didn't see the Guinea Fowls,\" said one of the Geese. \"We were  swimming when they came. How do they look? Are they handsomely dressed?  We shall not call upon them unless they are our kind of people.\" It was  some time since their last plucking for the season, and the Geese were  growing more airy every day now.    \"They are really very peculiar,\" said the Black Spanish Hen, \"and not at  all common-looking. I should call them decidedly genteel.\" Here the  Geese looked at each other and nodded. They were always talking about  being genteel, although if you had asked them, they might not have been  able to tell what they meant by the word. \"They are shaped quite like  small Hen Turkeys,\" added the Black Spanish Hen \"and their feathers are  a dark bluish-gray with round white spots all over them. They do not  wear any feathers on top of their heads. When I saw the first one, I  thought she must have lost hers in an accident, but after the others  came up, I knew it must be the custom in their family.\"    \"And they are shaped like us?\" asked the Hen Turkeys all together. They  were thinking that perhaps the Black Spanish Hen would call them  genteel-looking also, but she didn't.    \"Very much like you,\" she replied. \"In fact, I think they said something  about being related to your family, although I am not sure. Do you  remember, dear?\" she said, turning to the Black Spanish Cock.    \"Certainly,\" he answered. \"The Guinea Hen with the orange-colored legs  said that their family was related to both the Turkeys and the Peacocks,  and that they were pleased to see members of those families here.\"    \"Gobble-gobble-gobble,\" called the Gobbler to the Hen Turkeys. \"You must  call upon our relatives as soon as you can. I will go later. I always  wait to find out more about strangers before calling. It is my way.\" He  didn't stop to think that if everybody waited as long as he did, the  strangers would be very lonely.    After this, they scattered to feed, and the Hen Turkeys and their  children looked for the Guinea Fowls. \"Listen,\" said one, \"and we may  hear them talking to each other.\" They stood still, with their heads  well up and turned a little to one side. They heard a harsh voice  saying, \"Ca-mac! Ca-mac!\" and as none of their old friends ever said  \"Ca-mac!\" they knew at once that it was one of the newcomers. They  walked around the corner of the Sheep-shed, and there found them, a  Guinea Cock and two Guinea Hens. One of the Guinea Hens had  orange-colored legs, while the others had dark grayish-brown ones.    \"Good-morning,\" said the Hen Turkeys. \"Are you the Guinea Fowls?\"    \"We are,\" said the one with the bright-colored legs, \"and you are the  Turkeys, are you not?\"    \"We are the Hen Turkeys,\" said they, \"and these are our children. The  Gobbler didn't feel that he could come with us this morning, but he will  come later. He got very tired in Grasshopper season and is hardly over  it yet.\"    \"That is too bad,\" said the Guinea Cock politely. \"We hope he will soon  be better. It is a hard time for all Turkeys--so much running to and  fro, besides the stretching of the neck whenever a Grasshopper comes  near.\"    \"Perhaps he overate somewhat,\" said one of the Hen Turkeys. \"We were  quite worried about him for a time. He slept so poorly and dreamed that  he was being chased. He always has a good appetite, and you know how it  is when there is so much food around. One cannot let it alone.\"    So they chatted on about one thing and another, and walked as they  visited. The Guinea Fowls were more fussy and restless than the Turkeys,  and even when they were speaking would run after some dainty bit of food  that had just caught their eyes. Of course the Hen Turkeys said how glad  they were to have the Guinea Fowls come there to live, and hoped that  they would enjoy their new home. All of the farmyard people thought it a  most delightful place.    \"Oh, yes,\" cried the Guinea Hen with the bright-colored legs, \"it is  very pleasant, of course, but I wish you could see the farm we left.\"    \"Why! Was it better than this?\" asked the Turkey Chicks, crowding around  her. They were so surprised that they forgot their mothers' telling them  that if they came they must be very quiet, and making them all repeat  together, \"Little Turkeys should be seen and not heard.\"    \"Better? My dears, it was not to be spoken of in the same breath. I  understand that when one has always lived here, this may seem very nice,  but when one has known better things, it is hard to be contented.\"    \"Still, we shall be very happy here, I am sure,\" said the other Guinea  Hen, the one with the brown legs. \"People all seem so bright and  pleasant. I like it very much indeed.\"    \"We are glad of that,\" said the Turkeys all together. \"We really must be  going. We fear we have stayed too long already. The Gobbler will wonder  if we are never coming back. Good-morning.\"    As they walked off to look for him, one Hen Turkey said to another, \"It  must be hard to come here after living on that farm.\"    \"Yes,\" was the answer, \"I suppose that we don't really know what comfort  is here.\"    When the Gobbler asked them about the Guinea Fowls, and how they were  enjoying their new home, the Hen Turkeys sighed and answered, \"Oh, as  well as they can enjoy this farm, we suppose.\" The Gobbler was a little  surprised by this reply, but he said nothing, and as he pecked at the  corn which had just been spilled from the load the Oxen were drawing, he  thought, \"I wish we could have better corn to eat. This does not taste  quite as it should.\"    When the Geese met the Guinea Fowls, they began to speak of the pleasure  of living on such a fine farm. \"Ah,\" said the Guinea Hen with the  bright-colored"]]]
