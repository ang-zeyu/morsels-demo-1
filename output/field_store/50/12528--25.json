The euhemerists assigned a definite date to Lug's death, but side by  side with this the memory of his divinity prevailed, and he appears as  the father and helper of Cuchulainn, who was possibly a rebirth of the  god.[320] His high position appears in the fact that the Gaulish  assembly at Lugudunum was held in his honour, like the festival of  Lugnasad in Ireland. Craftsmen brought their wares to sell at this  festival of the god of crafts, while it may also have been a harvest  festival.[321] Whether it was a strictly solar feast is doubtful, though  Professor Rh[^y]s and others insist that Lug is a sun-god. The name of  the Welsh Lleu, \"light,\" is equated with Lug, and the same meaning  assigned to the latter.[322] This equation has been contested and is  doubtful, Lugus probably meaning \"hero.\"[323] Still the sun-like traits  ascribed to Lug before Mag-tured suggest that he was a sun-god, and  solar gods elsewhere, e.g. the Polynesian Maui, are culture-gods as  well. But it should be remembered that Lug is not associated with the  true solar festivals of Beltane and Midsummer.    While our knowledge of the Tuatha De Danann is based upon a series of  mythic tales and other records, that of the gods of the continental  Celts, apart from a few notices in classical authors and elsewhere,  comes from inscriptions. But as far as can be judged, though the names  of the two groups seldom coincide, their functions must have been much  alike, and their origins certainly the same. The Tuatha De Danann were  nature divinities of growth, light, agriculture--their symbols and  possessions suggesting fertility, e.g. the cauldron. They were  divinities of culture and crafts, and of war. There must have been many  other gods in Ireland than those described here, while some of those may  not have been worshipped all over Ireland. Generally speaking, there  were many local gods in Gaul with similar functions but different names,  and this may have been true of Ireland. Perhaps the different names  given to Dagda, Manannan, and others were simply names of similar local  gods, one of whom became prominent, and attracted to himself the names  of the others. So, too, the identity of Danu and Brigit might be  explained, or the fact that there were three Brigits. We read also in  the texts of the god of Connaught, or of Ulster, and these were  apparently regional divinities, or of \"the god of Druidism\"--perhaps a  god worshipped specially by Druids.[324] The remote origin of some of  these divinities may be sought in the primitive cult of the Earth  personified as a fertile being, and in that of vegetation and  corn-spirits, and the vague spirits of nature in all its aspects. Some  of these still continued to be worshipped when the greater gods had been  evolved. Though animal worship was not lacking in Ireland, divinities  who are anthropomorphic forms of earlier animal-gods are less in  evidence than on the Continent. The divinities of culture, crafts, and  war, and of departments of nature, must have slowly assumed the definite  personality assigned them in Irish religion. But, doubtless, they  already possessed that before the Goidels reached Ireland. Strictly  speaking, the underground domain assigned later to the Tuatha De Danann  belongs only to such of them as were associated with fertility. But in  course of time most of the group, as underground dwellers, were  connected with growth and increase. These could be blighted by their  enemies, or they themselves could withhold them when their worshippers  offended them.[325]    Irish mythology points to the early pre-eminence of goddesses. As  agriculture and many of the arts were first in the hands of women,  goddesses of fertility and culture preceded gods, and still held their  place when gods were evolved. Even war-goddesses are prominent in  Ireland. Celtic gods and heroes are often called after their mothers,  not their fathers, and women loom largely in the tales of Irish  colonisation, while in many legends they play a most important part.  Goddesses give their name to divine groups, and, even where gods are  prominent, their actions are free, their personalities still clearly  defined. The supremacy of the divine women of Irish tradition is once  more seen in the fact that they themselves woo and win heroes; while  their capacity for love, their passion, their eternal youthfulness and  beauty are suggestive of their early character as goddesses of  ever-springing fertility.[326]    This supremacy of goddesses is explained by Professor Rh[^y]s as  non-Celtic, as borrowed by the Celts from the aborigines.[327] But it is  too deeply impressed on the fabric of Celtic tradition to be other than  native, and we have no reason to suppose that the Celts had not passed  through a stage in which such a state of things was normal. Their innate  conservatism caused them to preserve it more than other races who had  long outgrown such a state of things.    FOOTNOTES:    [199] _HL_ 89; Stokes, _RC_ xii. 129.

These conquerors, from the Assyrian Queen to the British  Mercantile Company, have overrun and plundered India, but have left it the  same unintelligible, unchangeable, and marvellous country as before. It is  the same land now which the soldiers of Alexander described,--the land of  grotto temples dug out of solid porphyry; of one of the most ancient Pagan  religions of the world; of social distinctions fixed and permanent as the  earth itself; of the sacred Ganges; of the idols of Juggernaut, with its  bloody worship; the land of elephants and tigers; of fields of rice and  groves of palm; of treasuries filled with chests of gold, heaps of pearls,  diamonds, and incense. But, above all, it is the land of unintelligible  systems of belief, of puzzling incongruities, and irreconcilable  contradictions.    The Hindoos have sacred books of great antiquity, and a rich literature  extending back twenty or thirty centuries; yet no history, no chronology,  no annals. They have a philosophy as acute, profound and, spiritual as any  in the world, which is yet harmoniously associated with the coarsest  superstitions. With a belief so abstract that it almost escapes the grasp  of the most speculative intellect, is joined the notion that sin can be  atoned for by bathing in the Ganges or repeating a text of the Veda. With  an ideal pantheism resembling that of Hegel, is united the opinion that  Brahma and Siva can be driven from the throne of the universe by any one  who will sacrifice a sufficient number of wild horses. To abstract one's  self from matter, to renounce all the gratification of the senses, to  macerate the body, is thought the true road to felicity; and nowhere in  the world are luxury, licentiousness and the gratification of the  appetites carried so far. Every civil right and privilege of ruler and  subject is fixed in a code of laws, and a body of jurisprudence older far  than the Christian era, and the object of universal reverence; but the  application of these laws rests (says Rhode) on the arbitrary decisions of  the priests, and their execution on the will of the sovereign. The  constitution of India is therefore like a house without a foundation and  without a roof. It is a principle of Hindoo religion not to kill a worm,  not even to tread on a blade of grass, for fear of injuring life; but the  torments, cruelties, and bloodshed inflicted by Indian tyrants would shock  a Nero or a Borgia. Half the best informed writers on India will tell you  that the Brahmanical religion is pure monotheism; the other half as  confidently assert that they worship a million gods. Some teach us that  the Hindoos are spiritualists and pantheists; others that their idolatry  is more gross than that of any living people.    Is there any way of reconciling these inconsistencies? If we cannot find  such an explanation, there is at least one central point where we may  place ourselves; one elevated position, from which this mighty maze will  not seem wholly without a plan. In India the whole tendency of thought is  ideal, the whole religion a pure spiritualism. An ultra, one-sided  idealism is the central tendency of the Hindoo mind. The God of Brahmanism  is an intelligence, absorbed in the rest of profound contemplation. The  good man of this religion is he who withdraws from an evil world into  abstract thought.    Nothing else explains the Hindoo character as this does. An eminently  religious people, it is their one-sided spiritualism, their extreme  idealism, which gives rise to all their incongruities. They have no  history and no authentic chronology, for history belongs to this world,  and chronology belongs to time. But this world and time are to them wholly  uninteresting; God and eternity are all in all. They torture themselves  with self-inflicted torments; for the body is the great enemy of the  soul's salvation, and they must beat it down by ascetic mortifications.  But asceticism, here as everywhere else, tends to self-indulgence, since  one extreme produces another. In one part of India, therefore, devotees  are swinging on hooks in honor of Siva, hanging themselves by the feet,  head downwards, over a fire, rolling on a bed of prickly thorns, jumping  on a couch filled with sharp knives, boring holes in their tongues, and  sticking their bodies full of pins and needles, or perhaps holding the  arms over the head till they stiffen in that position. Meantime in other  places whole regions are given over to sensual indulgences, and companies  of abandoned women are connected with different temples and consecrate  their gains to the support of their worship.    As one-sided spiritualism will manifest itself in morals in the two forms  of austerity and sensuality, so in religion it shows itself in the  opposite direction of an ideal pantheism and a gross idolatry.  Spiritualism first fills the world full of God, and this is a true and  Christian view of things. But it takes another step, which is to deny all  real existence to the world, and so runs into a false pantheism. It first  says, truly, \"There is nothing _without_ God.\" It next says, falsely,  \"There is nothing _but_ God.\" This second step was taken in India by means  of the doctrine of _Maya_, or _Illusion. Maya_ means the delusive shows  which spirit assumes. For there is nothing but spirit; which neither  creates nor is created, neither acts nor suffers, which cannot change, and  into which all souls are absorbed when they free themselves by meditation  from the belief that they suffer or are happy, that they can experience  either pleasure or pain. The next step is to polytheism. For if God  neither creates nor destroys, but only seems to create and destroy, these  _appearances_ are not united together as being the acts of one Being, but  are separate, independent phenomena. When you remove personality from the  conception of God, as you do in removing will, you remove unity. Now if  creation be an illusion, and there be no creation, still the _appearance_  of creation is a fact. But as there is no substance but spirit, this  _appearance_ must have its cause in spirit, that is, is a _divine_  appearance, is God. So destruction, in the same way, is an appearance of  God, and reproduction is an appearance of God, and every other appearance  in nature is a manifestation of God. But the unity of will and person  being taken away, we have not one God, but a multitude of gods,--or  polytheism.    Having begun this career of thought, no course was possible for the human  mind to pursue but this. An ultra spiritualism must become pantheism, and  pantheism must go on to polytheism. In India this is not a theory, but a  history. We find, side by side, a spiritualism which denies the existence  of anything but motionless spirit or Brahm, and a polytheism which  believes and worships Brahma the Creator, Siva the Destroyer, Vischnu the  Preserver, Indra the God of the Heavens, the Sactis or energies of the  gods, Krishna the Hindoo Apollo, Doorga, and a host of others, innumerable  as the changes and appearances of things.    But such a system as this must necessarily lead also to idolatry. There is  in the human mind a tendency to worship, and men must worship something.  But they believe in one Being, the absolute Spirit, the supreme and only  God,--Para Brahm; _him_ they cannot worship, for he is literally an  unknown God. He has no qualities; no attributes, no activity. He is  neither the object of hope, fear, love, nor aversion. Since there is  nothing in the universe but spirit and illusive appearances, and they  cannot worship spirit because it is absolutely unknown, they must worship  these appearances, which are at any rate _divine_ appearances, and which  do possess some traits, qualities, character; _are_ objects of hope and  fear. But they cannot worship them as appearances, they must worship them  as persons. But if they have an inward personality or soul, they become  real beings, and also beings independent of Brahm, whose appearances they  are. They must therefore have an outward personality; in other words, a  body, a shape, emblematical and characteristic; that is to say, they  become idols.    Accordingly idol-worship is universal in India. The most horrible and  grotesque images are carved in the stone of the grottos, stand in rude,  block-like statues in the temple, or are coarsely painted on the walls.  Figures of men with heads of elephants or of other animals, or with six or  seven human heads,--sometimes growing in a pyramid, one out of the other,  sometimes with six hands coming from one shoulder,--grisly and uncouth  monsters, like nothing in nature, yet too grotesque for symbols,--such are  the objects of the Hindoo worship.        Sec. 3. Helps from Comparative Philology. The Aryans in Central Asia.      We have seen how hopeless the task has appeared of getting any definite  light on Hindoo chronology or history. To the ancient Egyptians events  were so important that the most trivial incidents of daily life were  written on stone and the imperishable records of the land, covering the  tombs and obelisks, have patiently waited during long centuries, till  their decipherer should come to read them. To the Hindoos, on the other  hand, all events were equally unimportant. The most unhistoric people on  earth, they cared more for the minutiae of grammar, or the subtilties of  metaphysics, than for the whole of their past. The only date which has  emerged from this vague antiquity is that of Chandragupta, a contemporary  of Alexander, and called by the Greek historians Sandracottus. He became  king B.C. 315, and as, at his accession, Buddha had been dead (by Hindoo  statement) one hundred and sixty-two years, Buddha may have died B.C. 477.  We can thus import a single date from Greek history into that of India.  This is the whole.    But all at once light dawns on us from an unexpected quarter. While we can "]]]
