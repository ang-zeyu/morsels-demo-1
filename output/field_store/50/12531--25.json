Perhaps, though, he's only guzzling buns or swilling coffee somewhere.  Let's see.\"    The quintette thereupon spread themselves out, but every shop was drawn  blank.    \"Rum!\" said Rogers. \"Where can the ass be?\"    \"If we knew, Solomon, would we try to find out?\" said Sharpe.    \"I say, you fellows--I've got an idea about Grimmy. Didn't Lancaster  give him a leg-up for his chemistry the other day? Permission to footle  in the lab. on half-holidays, and all the rest of it? Grim was no end  cocky over that.\"    \"Grimmy waste a 'halfer' bottle-washing! Rot! That isn't his form,  Wilson.\"    \"If,\" said Poulett, impressively, \"he _has_ sunk so low, we must give  him an 'elpin' 'and, pore feller!\"    \"Rather. If Lancaster has put the cover over old Grimmy we must get him  out somehow. Let's adjourn to see.\"    The honourable five forthwith moved over to the laboratory, and Grim  received his beloved cronies with hot blushes and a rather nervous  manner.    \"I say, you chaps, what do you want?\"    \"What did we want?\" said Bourne, as though he'd forgotten it. \"What was  it, Rogers?\"    \"A fellow, formerly Grimmy, not a nasty bottle-washer,\" said Rogers,  more in sorrow than in anger.    \"But yesterday and Grimmy was an average back, and now he's holding up  some filthy brew to the sunlight to see how muddy it is. Oh, my great  aunt!\" chimed in Wilson.    \"How are the mighty fallen!\" gasped Sharpe.    \"Look here, you fellows--\" began Grim, with still more vivid blushes  mantling his noble face.    \"'Ear, 'ear! speech! speech! withdraw! apologize!\"    \"I'm not ashamed of being here and doing a little chemistry for my own  amusement, so there; and you fellows had better cut before Lancaster  comes and runs you all in.\"    \"That is all right, Grimmy. Lancaster's sporting a silk tile, so he's  off to town. To think of your cutting our six-a-side to puff down a  dirty blow-pipe! Come out, you idiot, and get into your footer togs!\"  said Sharpe.    \"I'm not coming, I tell you.\"    \"Insanity in the family, evidently,\" observed Poulett, judicially.    \"Aren't you coming, really?\"    \"No, I'm not; do get out and leave me alone!\"    \"Never!\" said Poulett. \"We'll stay with him and see him through the fit,  eh?\"    \"Rather! We'll never desert you, Grimmy!\"    \"We'll let the six-a-side slide for this afternoon, and we'll help  Grimmy with his salt,\" suggested the egg-poacher, brilliantly; and any  amount of hidden meaning was in the word \"help.\"    \"We will! we will!\" cried the rest, spotting Poulett's idea instanter,  with enthusiastic joy; and despite Grim's frenzied declamation and  eloquence they all \"helped.\"    For two hours--as lively a couple of hours as ever were passed within  the laboratory--Gus lay low behind the far bench and enjoyed the  afternoon's performance far more than Grim. The green powder underwent  some weird experiments, each of the quintette availing himself of Grim's  knowledge and test-tubes and acid-bottles with the utmost freedom. The  analysis of Lancaster's mixture gave various results, but when Rogers  \"found\" rhubarb and black-lead this was held the correct find, and after  this verdict the generous five put up the test-tubes in the rack. They  all said Rogers had settled the matter, and anyway they had had a jolly  time.    \"Understand,\" observed Poulett, as he washed away some acid stains from  his bare knees, \"that Grimmy is not ashamed of his black-lead and  rhubarb hunt.\"    \"Why those vivid blushes, then?\"    \"We never bargained that old Grim would copy that Fifth Form ass, Todd,  and chum up with Lancaster, did we?\"    \"What did you say about Todd?\" inquired Grim, suavely.    \"Said he was an ass.\"    \"A what?\"    \"An ass, a jackass, a howling jackass!\" cried Poulett, _crescendo_.    \"How?\"    \"Remember Corker pitching into him? Said he wasn't fit for a decent  nursery, and Toddy had his mouth open all the time.\"    [Illustration: THE GREEN POWDER UNDERWENT SOME WEIRD EXPERIMENTS]    \"Bully Cotton has given Toddy up. Toddy was too big an ass even for  Cotton,\" remarked Wilson.    \"He looks fairly intelligent,\" observed Grim, in a gentle whisper.    \"So did you, almost, till you started fooling like this.\"    Grim artistically kept the conversation on Todd, and Gus learned how  like an ass each individual of the quintette thought him. He smiled  gently at Grim's astuteness in paying him out so neatly for his previous  friendly remarks about chucking out. When the first stroke of the  roll-call bell reached the laboratory he emerged solemnly and with state  from his retreat, and stalked quietly through the knot of his outspoken  critics, who were instantly besieged by a variety of emotions. He closed  the laboratory door after him, and, when he saw the key outside, the  temptation to repay the left-handed compliments of Poulett and Co. in  their own coin was too strong. Gus gently turned the key, and was  halfway down the corridor before the band arrived at the locked door.    \"Let us out!\" shrieked Rogers. \"We'll apologize all of us--won't we,  Poulett?\"    \"Yes!\" yelled Poulett. \"Anything! Oh, Todd, do let us out!\"    But Todd went on his way, serenely ignoring the frantic appeals behind  him, and turned out into the street with a sweet smile on his face.    \"That beast, Todd, has gone, and Merishall will ladle us out three  hundred of Virgil for missing call-over,\" moaned Bourne.    \"It's four hundred, if Merishall takes it,\" said Rogers, with dire  conviction.    \"Not for me,\" said Grim, beaming cheerfully around; \"I'm all right. I'll  tell Merishall that the door was locked; but as for you five idiots, who  oughtn't to be here at all--well! What the dickens did you want to call  old Toddy all those fancy names for, you silly cuckoos?\"    \"Oh, look here, Grim, you artful bounder,\" shouted Poulett, bitterly,  \"you've got us into this mess. Why didn't you say Todd was behind those  back benches?\"    \"Yes, why?\" shouted the rest of the raging fags. \"We'll scrag you for  this, darling. Cuckoos are we? Scrag him--put him in the scrum.\"    W.E. Grim had a very bad five minutes, but when he crawled out of the  scrum, hot, damaged, and dusty, he said viciously--    \"I hope Merishall gives you a thou., you beastly cads. You've mucked up  my afternoon, and I'm hanged if I don't tell Lancaster.\"    Ten minutes after roll-call the janitor let them out, and shortly  afterwards a wretched procession of five emerged from Merishall's room  with two hundred lines from Virgil hanging over each head for a missed  call-over without excuse. Grim worked an artistic revenge on his  scrummagers by calling personally the next half-holiday to inquire if  they would prefer to analyze a green salt or to play a six-a-side  against Merishall's lot. In every instance a Virgil hurtled towards his  head. Having done his duty to his friends, he left them to pious AEneas  and the slope of Avernus, whilst he got another salt from the  science-master, and, with Gus, possessed the laboratory in peace.          CHAPTER XX    ACTON'S TRUMP CARD      On the Saturday before we should go home Acton was due at Aldershot, and  would return the same night, as the fellows hoped, with his laurels  thick upon him. Bourne and Vercoe were staying at school a week later  than we, for the rackets did not come off until our holidays had  commenced. Toby had begged for this almost with tears in his eyes, for  he had a mortal dread of the relaxing process of a week at home.    \"You'd have no 'ands, Mr. Bourne, no spring, no eyes, when you toed the  mark at Kensington. I'll send you fit if I have you here.\"    So Vercoe and Phil agreed to stay.    And now Acton determined to put into operation his long-thought-of  scheme for the paying off of the score against Phil. It was subtle, and  founded on a perfect knowledge of Bourne's character, and a perfect  disregard of the consequences to any one--even including himself. Acton  would have willingly martyred himself, if he could have inflicted a  little of the torments on Bourne too.    There was one rule from which Dr. Moore never swerved a hair's breadth.  Compared to this particular law the stringency of the Old Game  regulation for Thursday was lax indeed. He never had departed from it,  and he never would depart from it. If any fellow took it into his head  to slip out of his house after lights out at ten on any pretence  whatever he was expelled. There was some legend in connection with this  severity, what exactly none of us rightly knew, but according to the  tale the escapade of two fellows years ago, when Corker was new to the  place, had resulted in one of the fellows being shot. Twice had he  expelled fellows while I was at school--Remington and Cunningham--and I  cannot ever forget the old man's deathlike face as he told them to go.  Some fellows broke out and were not found out, for Corker wasn't going  to have any barred windows as in some places. Any one _could_ break out  any night he liked, but he knew what he might expect if he were caught.  There was no help. Remington had been found out, and though there had  been Remingtons in the school since Anne's reign, Corker was inexorable.  He was expelled.    In a word, Acton determined to go to London and to take young Bourne  with him, and so risk certain expulsion for both, supposing they were  discovered. He had no intention of being expelled, though; for he liked  the life at St. Amory's, where incense floated round him all day long,  but he meant, when he had accomplished the ruin of Jack, to let Bourne  senior know it. Acton gloated in advance over Phil's anger, shame, and  consternation, and--this was the cream of the joke--his utter inability  to do anything except keep silence and chew the bitter cud of hopeless  rage against him--the man to whom he would not give the footer cap.  Acton never thought of Jack's share in the"]]]
