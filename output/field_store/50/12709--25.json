You will live on our selection, won't  you?\"    But the Kangaroo looked very doubtful, and said that she loved Dot, but  she was afraid of Humans and their dogs.    [Illustration: DOT'S FATHER ABOUT TO SHOOT THE KANGAROO]    After a supper of berries and grass, Dot and the Kangaroo lay down for  the night in a little bower of bushes. But they talked until very late,  of how they were to manage to reach Dot's home without danger from guns  and dogs. At last, when they tried to sleep, they could not do so on  account of Willy Wagtail's singing to his sweetheart, \"Sweet pretty  creature! Sweet pretty creature!\" without stopping, for more than five  minutes at a time.    \"I wonder Chip-pi-ti-chip doesn't get tired of that song,\" said Dot.    \"She never does,\" yawned the Kangaroo, \"and he never tires of singing it.\"    \"Sweet pretty creature,\" sang Willy Wagtail.          CHAPTER XIII      Two men were walking near a cottage in the winter sunlight of the early  morning. There came to the door a young woman, who looked pale and  tired. She carried a bowl of milk to a little calf, and on her way back  to the cottage she paused, and shading her eyes, that were red with  weeping, lingered awhile, looking far and near. Then, with a sigh, she  returned indoors and worked restlessly at her household duties.    \"It breaks my heart to see my wife do that,\" said the taller man, who  carried a gun. \"All day long she comes out and looks for the child. One  knows, now, that the poor little one can never come back to us,\" and as  the big man spoke there was a queer choking in his voice.    The younger man did not speak, but he patted his friend's shoulder in a  kindly manner, which showed that he too was very sorry.    \"Even you have lost heart, Jack,\" said the big bushman, \"but we shall  find her yet; the wife shall have that comfort.\"    \"You'll never do it now,\" said the young fellow with a mournful shake of  the head. \"There is not an inch of ground that so young a child could  reach that we have not searched. The mystery is, what could have become  of her?\"    \"That's what beats me,\" said the tall man, who was Dot's father. \"I  think of it all day and all night. There is the track of the dear little  mite as clear as possible for five miles, as far as the dry creek. The  trackers say she rested her poor weary legs by sitting under the  blackbutt tree. At that point she vanishes completely. The blacks say  there isn't a trace of man, or beast, beyond that place excepting the  trail of a big kangaroo. As you say, it's a mystery!\"    As the men walked towards the bush, close to the place where Dot had run  after the hare the day she was lost, neither of them noticed the fuss  and scolding made by a Willy Wagtail; although the little bird seemed  likely to die of excitement.    Willy Wagtail was really saying, \"Dot and her Kangaroo are coming this  way. Whatever you do, don't shoot them with that gun.\"    Presently the young man, Jack, noticed the little bird. \"What friendly  little chaps those wagtails are,\" he said, \"and see how tame and  fearless this one is. Upon my word, he nearly flew in your face that  time!\"    [Illustration: DOT WAVING ADIEU TO THE KANGAROO]    Dot's father did not notice the remark, for he had stopped suddenly, and  was peering into the bush whilst he quietly shifted his gun into  position, ready to raise it and fire.    \"By Jove!\" he said, \"I saw the head of a Kangaroo a moment ago behind  that iron-bark. Fancy it's coming so near the house. Next time it shows,  I'll get a shot at it.\"    Both men waited for the moment when the Kangaroo should be seen again.    The next instant the Kangaroo bounded out of the Bush into the open  paddock. Swift as lightning up went the cruel gun, but, as it exploded  with a terrible report, the man, Jack, struck it upwards, and the fatal  bullet lodged in the branch of a tall gum tree.    \"Great Scott!\" exclaimed Jack, pointing at the Kangaroo.    \"Dot!\" cried her father, dropping his gun, and stumbling blindly forward  with outstretched arms, towards his little girl, who had just tumbled  out of the Kangaroo's pouch in her hurry to reach her father.    \"Hoo! hoo! ho! ho! he! he! ha! ha! ha! ha!\" laughed a Kookooburra on a  tree, as he saw Dot clasped in her father's great strong arms, and the  little face hidden in his big brown beard.    \"Wife! wife!\" shouted Dot's father, \"Dot's come back! Dot's come back!\"    \"Dot's here!\" yelled the young man, as he ran like mad to the house. And  all the time the good Kangaroo sat up on her haunches, still panting  with fear from the sound of the gun, and a little afraid to stay, yet so  interested in all the excitement and delight, that she couldn't make up  her mind to hop away.    \"Dadda,\" said Dot, \"You nearly killed Dot and her Kangaroo! Oh! if you'd  killed my Kangaroo, I'd never have been happy any more!\"    \"But I don't understand,\" said her father. \"How did you come to be in  the Kangaroo's pouch?\"    \"Oh! I've got lots and lots to tell you!\" said Dot; \"but come and stroke  dear Kangaroo, who saved little Dot and brought her home.\"    \"That I will!\" said Dot's father, \"and never more will I hurt a  Kangaroo!\"    \"Nor any of the Bush creatures,\" said Dot. \"Promise, Dadda!\"    \"I promise,\" said the big man, in a queer-sounding voice, as he kissed  Dot over and over again, and walked towards the frightened animal.    Dot wriggled down from her father's arms, and said to the Kangaroo,  \"It's all right; no one's ever going to be shot or hurt here again!\" and  the Kangaroo looked delighted at the good news.    \"Dadda,\" said Dot, holding her father's hand, and, with her disengaged  hand touching the Kangaroo's little paw. \"This is my own dear Kangaroo.\"  Dot's father, not knowing quite how to show his gratitude, stroked the  Kangaroo's head, and said \"How do you do?\" which, when he came to think  of it afterwards, seemed rather a foolish thing to say. But he wasn't  used, like Dot, to talking to Bush creatures, and had not eaten the  berries of understanding.    The Kangaroo saw that Dot's father was grateful, and so she was pleased,  but she did not like to be stroked by a man who let off guns, so she was  glad that Dot's mother had run to where they were standing, and was  hugging and kissing the little girl, and crying all the time; for then  Dot's father turned and watched his wife and child, and kept doing  something to his eyes with a handkerchief, so that there was no  attention to spare for Kangaroos.    The good Kangaroo, seeing how happy these people were, and knowing that  her life was quite safe, wanted to peep about Dot's home and see what it  was like--for kangaroos can't help being curious. So presently she  quietly hopped off towards the cottage, and then a very strange thing  happened. Just as the Kangaroo was wondering what the great iron tank by  the kitchen door was meant for, there popped out of the open door a joey  Kangaroo. Now, to human beings, all joey Kangaroos look alike, but  amongst Kangaroos there are no two the same, and Dot's Kangaroo at once  recognised in the little Joey her own baby Kangaroo. The Joey knew its  mother directly, and, whilst Dot's Kangaroo was too astonished to move,  and not being able to think, was trying to get at a conclusion why her  Joey was coming out of a cottage, the little Kangaroo, with a  hop-skip-and-a-jump, had landed itself comfortably in the nice pouch Dot  had just vacated.    Then Dot's mother, rejoicing over the safe return of her little girl,  was not more happy than the Kangaroo with her Joey once more in her  pouch. With big bounds she leapt towards Dot, and the little girl  suddenly looking round for her Kangaroo friend, clapped her hands with  delight as she saw a little grey nose, a pair of tiny black paws, and  the point of a little black tail, hanging out of the pouch that had  carried her so often.    \"Why!\" exclaimed Dot's mother, \"if she hasn't got the little Joey, Jack  brought me yesterday! He picked it up after a Kangaroo hunt some time  ago.\"    \"It's her Joey; her lost Joey!\" cried Dot, running to the Kangaroo. \"Oh!  dear Kangaroo, I am so glad!\" she said, \"for now we are all happy; as  happy as can be!\" Dot hugged her Kangaroo, and kissed the little Joey,  and they all three talked together, so that none of them understood what  the others were saying, only that they were all much pleased and  delighted.    \"Wife,\" said Dot's father, \"I'll tell you what's mighty queer, our  little girl is talking away to those animals, and they're all  understanding one another, as if it was the most natural thing in the  world to treat Kangaroos as if they were human beings!\"    \"I expect,\" said his wife, \"that their feelings are not much different  from ours. See how that poor animal is rejoicing in getting back its  little one, just as we are over having our little Dot again.\"    \"To think of all the poor things I have killed,\" said Dot's father  sadly; \"I'll never do it again.\"    \"No,\" said his wife, \"we must try and get everyone to be kind to the  bush creatures, and protect them all we can.\"    This book would never come to an end if it told all that passed that  day. How Dot explained the wonderful power of the berries of  understanding, and how she told the kangaroos all that her parents  wanted her to say on their behalf, and what kind things the Kangaroo  said in return.    All day long the Kangaroo stayed near Dot's home, and the little girl  persuaded her to eat bread, which she said was \"most delicious, but one  would get tired of it sooner than of grass.\"    Every effort was made "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#19)"],[1,"perhaps the best of  the immediate followers. It was not until after Correggio's death, and  with the painters of the Decadence, that his work was seriously taken  up and followed.

(_Continued._)         BOOKS RECOMMENDED: The works on Italian art before mentioned       and also consult General Bibliography, (page xv.).      THE VENETIAN SCHOOL: It was at Venice and with the Venetian painters  of the sixteenth century that a new art-motive was finally and fully  adopted. This art-motive was not religion. For though the religious  subject was still largely used, the religious or pietistic belief was  not with the Venetians any more than with Correggio. It was not a  classic, antique, realistic, or naturalistic motive. The Venetians  were interested in all phases of nature, and they were students of  nature, but not students of truth for truth's sake.    What they sought, primarily, was the light and shade on a nude  shoulder, the delicate contours of a form, the flow and fall of silk  or brocade, the richness of a robe, a scheme of color or of light, the  character of a face, the majesty of a figure. They were seeking  effects of line, light, color--mere sensuous and pictorial effects, in  which religion and classicism played secondary parts. They believed in  art for art's sake; that painting was a creation, not an illustration;  that it should exist by its pictorial beauties, not by its subject or  story. No matter what their subjects, they invariably painted them so  as to show the beauties they prized the highest. The Venetian  conception was less austere, grand, intellectual, than pictorial,  sensuous, concerning the beautiful as it appealed to the eye. And this  was not a slight or unworthy conception. True it dealt with the  fulness of material life, but regarded as it was by the Venetians--a  thing full-rounded, complete, harmonious, splendid--it became a great  ideal of existence.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--GIORGIONE(?). ORDEAL OF MOSES. UFFIZI.]    In technical expression color was the note of all the school, with  hardly an exception. This in itself would seem to imply a lightness of  spirit, for color is somehow associated in the popular mind with  decorative gayety; but nothing could be further removed from the  Venetian school than triviality. Color was taken up with the greatest  seriousness, and handled in such masses and with such dignified power  that while it pleased it also awed the spectator. Without having quite  the severity of line, some of the Venetian chromatic schemes rise in  sublimity almost to the Sistine modellings of Michael Angelo. We do  not feel this so much in Giovanni Bellini, fine in color as he was. He  came too early for the full splendor, but he left many pupils who  completed what he had inaugurated.    THE GREAT VENETIANS: The most positive in influence upon his  contemporaries of all the great Venetians was Giorgione (1477?-1511).  He died young, and what few pictures by him are left to us have been  so torn to pieces by historical criticism that at times one begins to  doubt if there ever was such a painter. His different styles have been  confused, and his pictures in consequence thereof attributed to  followers instead of to the master. Painters change their styles, but  seldom their original bent of mind. With Giorgione there was a lyric  feeling as shown in music. The voluptuous swell of line, the melting  tone of color, the sharp dash of light, the undercurrent of  atmosphere, all mingled for him into radiant melody. He sought pure  pictorial beauty and found it in everything of nature. He had little  grasp of the purely intellectual, and the religious was something he  dealt with in no strong devotional way. The fete, the concert, the  fable, the legend, with a landscape setting, made a stronger appeal to  him. More of a recorder than a thinker he was not the less a leader  showing the way into that new Arcadian grove of pleasure whose  inhabitants thought not of creeds and faiths and histories and  literatures, but were content to lead the life that was sweet in its  glow and warmth of color, its light, its shadows, its bending trees,  and arching skies. A strong full-blooded race, sober-minded,  dignified, rationally happy with their lot, Giorgione portrayed them  with an art infinite in variety and consummate in skill. Their least  features under his brush seemed to glow like jewels. The sheen of  armor and rich robe, a bare forearm, a nude back, or loosened  hair--mere morsels of color and light--all took on a new beauty. Even  landscape with him became more significant. His master, Bellini, had  been realistic enough in the details of trees and hills, but Giorgione  grasped the meaning of landscape as an entirety, and rendered it with  poetic breadth.    Technically he adopted the oil medium brought to Venice by Antonello  da Messina, introducing scumbling and glazing to obtain brilliancy and  depth of color. Of light-and-shade he was a master, and in atmosphere  excellent. He, in common with all the Venetians, is sometimes said to  be lacking in drawing, but that is the result of a misunderstanding.  The Venetians never cared to accent line, choosing rather to model in  masses of light and shadow and color. Giorgione was a superior man  with the brush, but not quite up to his contemporary Titian.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--TITIAN. VENUS EQUIPPING CUPID. BORGHESE PAL.,  ROME.]    That is not surprising, for Titian (1477-1576) was the painter easily  first in the whole range of Italian art. He was the first man in the  history of painting to handle a brush with freedom, vigor, and gusto.  And Titian's brush-work was probably the least part of his genius.  Calm in mood, dignified, and often majestic in conception, learned  beyond all others in his craft, he mingled thought, feeling, color,  brush-work into one grand and glowing whole. He emphasized nothing,  yet elevated everything. In pure intellectual thought he was not so  strong as Raphael. He never sought to make painting a vehicle for  theological, literary, or classical ideas. His tale was largely of  humanity under a religious or classical name, but a noble, majestic  humanity. In his art dignified senators, stern doges, and solemn  ecclesiastics mingle with open-eyed madonnas, winning Ariadnes, and  youthful Bacchuses. Men and women they are truly, but the very noblest  of the Italian race, the mountain race of the Cadore country--proud,  active, glowing with life; the sea race of Venice--worldly wise, full  of character, luxurious in power.    In himself he was an epitome of all the excellences of painting. He  was everything, the sum of Venetian skill, the crowning genius of  Renaissance art. He had force, power, invention,"]]]
