We know  that Germany did not deserve such treatment on the part of Great  Britain, and do not believe that Great Britain by this action did a  service to humanity and civilization.    Today we are facing hard facts. Germany has to fight for her existence.  She will fight knowing that the great powers beyond the ocean will do  her justice as soon as they know the truth.             *       *       *       *       *            REICHSTAG AND EMPEROR.      England, France, and Russia, unthreatened by Germany, go to war for  political reasons--Germany defends her independence and fights for her  very existence, for her future as a great power--How a peaceful people  were imbued with the spirit of war.      The last days of the month of July were days of anxiety and distress for  the German people. They hoped that they would be permitted to preserve  an honorable peace. A few months earlier, in 1913, when the centennial  of the war for independence from French oppression and the twenty-fifth  anniversary of Emperor William's ascent of the throne had been  celebrated, they had willingly taken upon their shoulders the great  sacrifice of the so-called \"Wehrvorlage,\" which increased the peace  strength of the standing army enormously and cost 1,000,000,000 marks.  They considered it simply as an increase of their peace insurance  premium. Our diplomats worked hard for the maintenance of peace, for the  localization of the Austro-Servian war. So sure were the leading men of  the empire of the preservation of general peace that at the beginning of  the week which was to bring general mobilization they said to each other  joyfully: Next week our vacation time begins. But they were fearfully  disappointed. Russia's unexpected, treacherous mobilization compelled  Germany to draw the sword also. On the evening of the first day of  August the one word, Mobilization! was flashed by the electric spark all  over the country. There was no more anxiety and uncertainty. Cool, firm  resolution at once permeated the entire German folk. The Reichstag was  called together for an extra session.    Three days later, on the anniversary of the battles of Weissenburg and  Spichern, the representatives of the German people met. This session,  which lasted only a few hours, proved worthy of the great historical  moment marking the beginning of such a conflagration as the world had  never seen before. The railroad lines were under military control and  used almost exclusively for purposes of mobilization. In spite of all  such difficulties, more than 300 of the 397 Deputies managed to get to  Berlin in time. The rest sent word that they were unable to come. On the  evening of Aug. 3 the Imperial Chancellor called the leaders of all  parties, including the Socialists, to his house and explained to them in  a concise and impressive statement how frivolously Germany had been  driven to war. At the time of this meeting the unanimous acceptance of  all war measures by the Reichstag was already assured. In numerous  conferences the heads of the several departments explained the content  and meaning of the bills to be submitted to the Reichstag. The  participants of the conferences showed already what spirit would  characterize the next day. The session of the Reichstag filled the  entire German nation with pride and enthusiasm; the Reichstag maintained  the dignity of the German Empire and the German people.    In greater numbers than ever before the Deputies, high officers of the  army and navy and the Civil Government assembled on Aug. 4, first in  houses of worship to pray to God, and then in the Royal Castle of  Berlin. The military character of the ceremony at the opening of the  session showed under what auspices this memorable act took place. The  Kaiser entered the hall in the simple gray field uniform, without the  usual pomp, unaccompanied by chamberlains and court officials and pages  in glittering court dresses. Only State Ministers, Generals, and  Admirals followed him to the throne, from where he read his speech,  after covering his head with his helmet. His voice betrayed the strain  under which he was laboring. Repeatedly he was interrupted by  enthusiastic applause, and when he closed, a rousing cheer thundered  through the famous White Hall, something that had never before occurred  there since the erection of the old castle. Then came a surprise. The  Emperor laid down the manuscript of his speech and continued speaking.  From now on he knew only Germans, he said, no differences of party,  creed, religion or social position, and he requested the party leaders  to give him their hands as a pledge that they all would stand by him \"in  Not und Tod\"--in death and distress. This scene was entirely impromptu,  and thus so much more impressive and touching. And it was hardly over  when the Reichstag--an unheard of proceeding in such surroundings--began  to sing the German national hymn, \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz.\" The  magnificent hall, until then only the scene of pompous court  festivities, witnessed an outburst of patriotism such as was never seen  there before. To the accompaniment of loud cheers the Kaiser walked out,  after shaking the hands of the Imperial Chancellor and the Chief of the  General Staff, von Moltke.    One hour later the Reichstag met in its own house. The Emperor had  begged for quick and thorough work. He was not to be disappointed.  Without any formalities the presiding officers of the last session were  re-elected--in times of peace and party strife this would have been  impossible. This short curtain raiser being over, the first act of the  drama began. Before an overcrowded house the Chancellor described simply  and clearly the efforts of the Government for the preservation of peace.  He stated cold facts, showing unmistakably Russia's double dealing and  justifying Germany's beginning of a war which she did not want. The  Chancellor had begun in a quiet, subdued tone. Then he raised his voice  and when, in words that rang through the hall, he declared that the  entire nation was united, the Deputies and the spectators in the  galleries could sit still no longer. They rose, with them at first some  Socialists, then all of them, carried away by the impulse of the  moment; the members of the Federal Council, of the press, diplomats and  the crowds in the galleries joined them. The whole multitude cheered and  clapped its hands frantically. It reflected truly the spirit of the  whole nation. The Speaker, who under ordinary circumstances would have  suppressed the clapping of hands as unparliamentary and the  demonstrations of the galleries as undignified, let the patriotic  outburst go on to its end.    After a short intermission the business meeting began. Sixteen war  measures had been introduced, the most important of which was the one  asking for 5,000,000,000 marks to carry on the war. The leader of the  Social Democrats read a statement explaining why his party, despite its  opposition on principle to all army and navy appropriations, would vote  for the proposed bills. Without further debates all the bills were  passed, and shortly after 5 P.M. the Reichstag adjourned. At 7 P.M. the  Emperor received the presiding officers of the Reichstag to thank them  for their prompt and useful work. He signed the bills, which were  immediately published and thus became laws.    The resolute attitude and quick work of the Reichstag reflected the  unity and resolution of the entire nation. Sixty-seven millions of  Germans feel, think, and act with their elected representatives. No  party, no class, no creed is standing back; all are imbued with one  single thought: United Germany is unconquerable.    The entire German people are united as never before in their history.  Even 101 years ago, in 1813, the entire population cannot have been so  uniformly seized by the spirit of war as at the outbreak of this  struggle, which is the people's war in the truest sense of the word, and  which was predicted by Bismarck. All reigning Princes are going out to  fight with the army and have appointed their wives as regents. Instances  include the Kaiser's son-in-law, the Duke of Brunswick, who appointed  his consort, the only daughter of the Emperor, as regent. The Princes  call their people to arms, and they themselves all stand ready to  sacrifice all they have. This example from above carries the nation with  them. The Reichstag knew parties and factions no more, and neither does  the nation. The Emperor sounded the word which has become common  property from Koenigsberg to Constance, from Upper Silesia to the Belgian  frontier: \"I know only Germans!\" And yet how terribly is our nation  otherwise disrupted by party strife. Ill-advised persons across our  frontiers hoped that creed differences would make for disunion,  Frenchmen and Russians expected to weaken our empire with the aid of  Alsatians and Poles. This hope has been destroyed--we are a united  people, as united as was the Reichstag, the Socialists included. The  latter have for years voted against all army and navy appropriations,  have advocated international peace, and last year voted against the  bills increasing the army strength. In many foreign quarters strong  hopes were nourished that this party would help them. But those men did  not know our German people. Our civilization, our independence as a  nation was threatened, and in that moment party interest or creed  existed no more. The true German heart is beating only for the  Fatherland, east and west, north and south, Protestants, Catholics, and  Jews are \"a united people of brethren in the hour of danger.\" When  Germany was so threatened by Russia, when the German \"Peace Emperor\" was  shamefully betrayed by the Czar of all the Russians, then there was but  one sacred party in existence: The party of Germans.             *       *       *    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#19)"],[1,"to the Jews, uniting with him, orders were issued to attack the castle.  The cruel multitude, united with the soldiery, felt such a desire of  slaughtering those they intended to despoil, that the sheriff, repenting  of the order, revoked it, but in vain; fanaticism and robbery once set  loose will satiate their appetency for blood and plunder. They solicited  the aid of the superior citizens, who, perhaps not owing quite so much  money to the Jews, humanely refused it; but having addressed the clergy  (the barbarous clergy of those days) were by them animated, conducted,  and blest.    The leader of this rabble was a canon regular, whose zeal was so fervent  that he stood by them in his surplice, which he considered as a coat of  mail, and reiteratedly exclaimed, \"Destroy the enemies of Jesus!\" This  spiritual laconism invigorated the arm of men who perhaps wanted no  other stimulative than the hope of obtaining the immense property of the  besieged. It is related of this canon, that every morning before he went  to assist in battering the walls he swallowed a consecrated wafer. One  day having approached too near, defended as he conceived by his  surplice, this church militant was crushed by a heavy fragment of the  wall, rolled from the battlement.    But the avidity of certain plunder prevailed over any reflection, which,  on another occasion, the loss of so pious a leader might have raised.  Their attacks continued; till at length the Jews perceived they could  hold out no longer, and a council was called, to consider what remained  to be done in the extremity of danger.    Among the Jews, their elder Rabbin was most respected. It has been  customary with this people to invite for this place some foreigner,  renowned among them for the depth of his learning, and the sanctity of  his manners. At this time the _Haham_, or elder Rabbin, was a foreigner,  who had been sent over to instruct them in their laws, and was a person,  as we shall observe, of no ordinary qualifications. When the Jewish  council was assembled, the Haham rose, and addressed them in this  manner--\"Men of Israel! the God of our ancestors is omniscient, and  there is no one who can say, Why doest thou this? This day He commands  us to die for His law; for that law which we have cherished from the  first hour it was given, which we have preserved pure throughout our  captivity in all nations, and which for the many consolations it has  given us, and the eternal hope it communicates, can we do less than die?  Posterity shall behold this book of truth, sealed with our blood; and  our death, while it displays our sincerity, shall impart confidence to  the wanderer of Israel. Death is before our eyes; and we have only to  choose an honourable and easy one. If we fall into the hands of our  enemies, which you know we cannot escape, our death will be ignominious  and cruel; for these Christians, who picture the Spirit of God in a  dove, and confide in the meek Jesus, are athirst for our blood, and  prowl around the castle like wolves. It is therefore my advice that we  elude their tortures; that we ourselves should be our own executioners;  and that we voluntarily surrender our lives to our Creator. We trace the  invisible Jehovah in his acts; God seems to call for us, but let us not  be unworthy of that call. Suicide, on occasions like the present, is  both rational and lawful; many examples are not wanting among our  forefathers: as I advise, men of Israel, they have acted on similar  occasions.\" Having said this, the old man sat down and wept.    The assembly was divided in their opinions. Men of fortitude applauded  its wisdom, but the pusillanimous murmured that it was a dreadful  counsel.    Again the Rabbin rose, and spoke these few words in a firm and decisive  tone:--\"My children! since we are not unanimous in our opinions, let  those who do not approve of my advice depart from this assembly!\"--Some  departed, but the greater number attached themselves to their venerable  priest. They now employed themselves in consuming their valuables by  fire; and every man, fearful of trusting to the timid and irresolute  hand of the women, first destroyed his wife and children, and then  himself. Jocenus and the Rabbin alone remained. Their lives were  protracted to the last, that they might see everything performed,  according to their orders. Jocenus being the chief Jew, was  distinguished by the last mark of human respect, in receiving his death  from the consecrated hand of the aged Rabbin, who immediately after  performed the melancholy duty on himself.    All this was transacted in the depth of the night. In the morning the  walls of the castle were seen wrapt in flames, and only a few miserable  and pusillanimous beings, unworthy of the sword, were viewed on the  battlements, pointing to their extinct brethren. When they opened the  gates of the castle, these men verified the prediction of their late  Rabbin; for the multitude, bursting through the solitary courts, found  themselves defrauded of their hopes, and in a moment avenged themselves  on the feeble wretches who knew not how to die with honour.    Such is the narrative of the Jews of York, of whom the historian can  only cursorily observe that five hundred destroyed themselves; but it is  the philosopher who inquires into the causes and the manner of these  glorious suicides. These are histories which meet only the eye of few,  yet they are of infinitely more advantage than those which are read by  every one. We instruct ourselves in meditating on these scenes of heroic  exertion; and if by such histories we make but a slow progress in  chronology, our heart however expands with sentiment.    I admire not the stoicism of Cato, more than the fortitude of the  Rabbin; or rather we should applaud that of the Rabbin much more; for  Cato was familiar with the animating visions of Plato, and was the  associate of Cicero and of Caesar. The Rabbin had probably read only the  Pentateuch, and mingled with companions of mean occupations, and meaner  minds. Cato was accustomed to the grandeur of the mistress of the  universe; and the Rabbin to the littleness of a provincial town. Men,  like pictures, may be placed in an obscure and unfavourable light; but  the finest picture, in the unilluminated corner, still retains the  design and colouring of the master. My Rabbin is a companion for Cato.  His history is a tale        Which Cato's self had not disdained to hear.--POPE.          THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE SEAS.      The sovereignty of the seas, which foreigners dispute with us, is as  much a conquest as any one obtained on land; it is gained and preserved  by our cannon, and the French, who, for ages past, exclaim against what  they call our tyranny, are only hindered from becoming themselves  universal tyrants over laud and sea, by that sovereignty of the seas  without which Great Britain would cease to exist.    In a memoir of the French Institute, I read a bitter philippic against  this sovereignty, and a notice then adapted to a writer's purpose, under  Bonaparte, of two great works: the one by Selden, and the other by  Grotius, on this subject. The following is the historical anecdote,  useful to revive:--    In 1634 a dispute arose between the English and Dutch concerning the  herring-fishery upon the British coast. The French and Dutch had always  persevered in declaring that the seas were perfectly free; and grounded  their reasons on a work of Grotius.    So early as in 1609 the great Grotius had published his treatise of  _Mare Liberum_ in favour of the freedom of the seas. And it is a curious  fact, that in 1618, Selden had composed another treatise in defence of  the king's dominion over the seas; but which, from accidents which are  known, was not published till the dispute revived the controversy.  Selden, in 1636, gave the world his _Mare Clausum_, in answer to the  _Mare Liberum_ of Grotius.    Both these great men felt a mutual respect for each other. They only  knew the rivalry of genius.    As a matter of curious discussion and legal investigation, the  philosopher must incline to the arguments of Selden, who has proved by  records the first occupancy of the English; and the English dominion  over the four seas, to the utter exclusion of the French and Dutch from  fishing, without our licence. He proves that our kings have always  levied great sums, without even the concurrence of their parliaments,  for the express purpose of defending this sovereignty at sea. A copy of  Selden's work was placed in the council-chest of the Exchequer, and in  the court of admiralty, as one of our most precious records.    The historical anecdote is finally closed by the Dutch themselves, who  now agreed to acknowledge the English sovereignty in the seas, and pay a  tribute of thirty thousand pounds to the King of England, for liberty to  fish in the seas, and consented to annual tributes.    That the Dutch yielded to Selden's arguments is a triumph we cannot  venture to boast. The _ultima ratio regum_ prevailed; and when we had  destroyed their whole fishing fleet, the affair appeared much clearer  than in the ingenious volumes of Grotius or Selden. Another Dutchman  presented the States-General with a ponderous reply to Selden's _Mare  Clausum_, but the wise Sommelsdyke advised the States to suppress the  idle discussion; observing that this affair must be decided by the  _sword_, and not by the _pen_.    It may be curious to add, that as no prevailing or fashionable subject  can be agitated, but some idler must interfere to make it extravagant  and very new, so this grave subject did not want for something of this  nature. A learned Italian, I believe, agreed with our author Selden in  general, that the _sea_, as well as the _earth_, is subject to some  States; but he maintained, that the dominion of the sea belonged to the  _Genoese_!
