In Gen.  Grant's Wilderness campaign the engineers built not less than  thirty-eight bridges between the Rappahannock and the James Rivers,  these bridges aggregating over 6,600 feet in length. Under favorable  circumstances such bridges can be built at the rate of 200 to 300 feet  per hour, and they can be taken up at a still more rapid rate. When  there is no bridge train at hand the engineer is obliged to use such  improvised materials as he can get; buildings are torn down to get  plank and trees are cut to make the frame. Sometimes single stringers  will answer, but if a greater length of bridge is required it may be  supported on piles or trestles, or in deep water on rafts of logs or  casks. But the heavy traffic of armies, operating at some distance  from their bases, must be transported by rail, and the building of  railway bridges or rebuilding those destroyed by the enemy is an  important duty of the engineer. On the Potomac Creek, in Virginia, a  trestle bridge 80 feet high and 400 feet long was built in nine  working days, from timber out of the neighborhood. Another bridge  across the Etowah River, in Georgia, was built in Gen. Sherman's  campaign, and a similar bridge was also built over the Chattahoochee.      SURVEYS AND EXPLORATIONS.    For more than half a century before the building of the great Pacific  railways, engineer officers were engaged in making surveys and  explorations in the great unknown country west of the Mississippi  River, and the final map of that country was literally covered with a  network of trails made by them. Several of these officers lost their  lives in such expeditions, while others lived to become more famous as  commanders during the great rebellion. Generals Kearney, J.E.  Johnston, Pope, Warren, Fremont and Parke, and Colonels Long, Bache,  Emory, Whipple, Woodruff and Simpson, Captains Warner, Stansbury,  Gunnison and many other officers, generally in their younger days,  contributed their quota to the geographical knowledge of the country,  and made possible the wonderful network of railways guarded by  military posts that has followed their footsteps. Their reports fill  twelve large quarto volumes.      BOUNDARY AND LAKE SURVEYS.    The astronomical location of the boundaries of the several States and  Territories, as well as of the United States, is a duty frequently  required of the engineer officer, and such a survey between this  country and Mexico is now in progress. The entire line of the 49th  parallel of latitude from the Lake of the Woods to the Pacific Ocean,  which forms our northern boundary, was located a few years ago by a  joint commission of English and United States engineers, and monuments  were established at short intervals over its entire length.    A careful geodetic and hydrographic survey of the Great Northern  Lakes, including every harbor upon them and the rivers connecting  them, was carried on for many years and was finally completed some ten  years ago. Maps and charts of these surveys are published from time to  time for use of pilots navigating these waters.    Not only are the duties of the military engineer similar in many  respects to those of the civil engineer, but there are many instances  in which the duties of one branch of the profession have been  performed by members of the other branch, quite as efficiently as  though they had been performed by engineers specially educated for the  purpose. During the late civil war there were many illustrations of  this, all showing that an ingenious engineer can readily adapt himself  to circumstances entirely different from those to which he has been  accustomed. A very good example of this occurred in the Red River  expedition of General Banks and Admiral Porter. In that memorable but  disastrous campaign an army accompanied by a fleet of transports and  light draught gunboats, sometimes called \"tin clads\" because some  parts of them were covered with boiler plate to stop the bullets of  the enemy, ascended the Red River in Louisiana; but the advance having  been checked and a retreat commenced, it was found that the river had  fallen to such a low state that the fleet was caught above the rapids  near Alexandria, and it would in all probability have been a complete  loss had it not been for the timely application of engineering skill  by Lieut. Col. Joseph Bailey, a civil engineer from Wisconsin, who  built a temporary dam across the river below the rapids and floated  out the entire fleet. This dam was over 750 feet long and in  connection with some auxiliary dams raised the water level some 61/2  feet. It was built under many difficulties, but by the skill and  ability of the engineer and the co-operation of the troops it was  completed in ten days. Another case was at the siege of Petersburg,  Va., where Lieut. Col. Pleasants, a Pennsylvania coal miner, ran a  gallery from our lines, under the rebel battery, some 500 feet  distant, and blew it entirely out of existence. The mine contained  four tons of powder and produced a crater 200 feet by 50 feet and 25  feet deep, and was completed in one month. The sequel to this was to  be an attack on the enemy's line through the gap made by the  explosion, and such an attack properly followed up would doubtless  have had a marked effect in shortening the duration of the war, but  this attack was so badly managed that it utterly failed and caused a  severe loss to our own army. The mine itself, however, was a great  success and produced a decided moral effect on both sides which lasted  until the end of the war.    It may be out of place to digress a moment to illustrate the moral  effect of such a convulsion. Several weeks after this great mine  explosion, the 18th Army Corps, to which I then belonged, was holding  a line of works recently captured from the rebels, about six miles  from Richmond, when one night the colonel commanding Fort Harrison, a  large field work forming a part of this line, came down to  headquarters and reported that some old Pennsylvania coal miners in  his command had heard mining going on under the fort. As the nearest  part of the enemy's line was some 400 yards from the fort, I was quite  certain that they could not have run a gallery that distance in the  time that had elapsed since we occupied the work, but there was of  course the possibility that the mine had been partly built beforehand  so as to be ready in just such a case as had arisen, viz., the capture  of the fort by our troops. I therefore went with the colonel up to the  fort to listen for the mining operations, and got the men who claimed  to have heard the subterranean noises, down in the bottom of the ditch  of the fort, which was ten feet deep, and at the angles formed a  fairly good listening gallery, but nothing unusual could be heard. I  therefore made arrangements to sink a line of pits in the bottom of  the ditch, something like ordinary wells; the bottoms of these pits to  be finally connected by a horizontal gallery which would envelop the  fort and enable us to hear the enemy and blow him up, before he could  get under the fort. Although the commanding officer of that fort was  as brave an officer as the war developed, he would not keep his men in  the fort after dark, but withdrew them quietly to the flanks of the  work, where they not only would be safe from an explosion, but would  be ready to fall upon the enemy in case he should blow up the fort and  rush in to capture the line, as our troops had attempted to do at  Petersburg. No explosion took place, however, and after our  countermining work was completed, the garrison became reassured and  remained in the fort at night as well as in day time. A few months  later, when the enemy was driven from his lines, I went through his  works to see whether any mining had been attempted, and found that a  gallery leading toward Fort Harrison had been carried quite a  distance, but was still incomplete, and it is barely possible that the  old miners were right, after all, in thinking that they could hear the  sound of the pick, although the distance was almost too great to make  this theory very probable.    Still another illustration of the way in which civil engineers can  make themselves extremely useful in military operations was the  wonderful system of military railways, or railways operated for  military purposes, that formed complete lines of transportation for  the armies and their enormous quantities of supplies and munitions,  more especially those in the West and Southwest. Construction trains  were organized in the most complete style, and when a piece of track  or a number of bridges were destroyed by the enemy, they would be  rebuilt so rapidly that our trains would hardly seem to be delayed by  it. The trains carried spare rails, ties, and bridges of various  lengths ready to put up, and they also carried the necessary rolling  stock and tools for destroying the roads and bridges of the enemy. So  expert had this construction corps become that the enemy was ready to  believe almost any statement in regard to it. General Sherman tells of  an instance where it was proposed to blow up a tunnel, to check his  \"March to the Sea,\" when one of the men objected, saying it was of no  use, for Sherman had a duplicate tunnel in his train.    Although this is not a sermon, it may not be out of place to point out  a few qualifications common to all engineers, for they all deal more  or less with the same materials and forces and employ similar methods  of investigation and construction. Wood, iron, steel, copper and stone  and their compounds are the materials of the civil, mining, mechanical  and electrical, as well as of the military engineers. They all deal  with the forces of gravitation, cohesion, inertia and chemical  affinity. They all require skill,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#19)"],[1,"of  corresponding states to be more closely examined in the case of  homogeneous substances. It has shown that, as I have already said,  bodies must be arranged in groups, and this fact clearly proves that  the properties of a given fluid are not determined by its critical  constants alone, and that it is necessary to add to them some other  specific parameters; M. Mathias and M. D. Berthelot have indicated  some which seem to play a considerable part.    It results also from this that the characteristic equation of a fluid  cannot yet be considered perfectly known. Neither the equation of Van  der Waals nor the more complicated formulas which have been proposed  by various authors are in perfect conformity with reality. We may  think that researches of this kind will only be successful if  attention is concentrated, not only on the phenomena of  compressibility and dilatation, but also on the calorimetric  properties of bodies. Thermodynamics indeed establishes relations  between those properties and other constants, but does not allow  everything to be foreseen.    Several physicists have effected very interesting calorimetric  measurements, either, like M. Perot, in order to verify Clapeyron's  formula regarding the heat of vaporization, or to ascertain the values  of specific heats and their variations when the temperature or the  pressure happens to change. M. Mathias has even succeeded in  completely determining the specific heats of liquefied gases and of  their saturated vapours, as well as the heat of internal and external  vaporization.      Sec. 2. THE LIQUEFACTION OF GASES, AND THE PROPERTIES OF BODIES AT A       LOW TEMPERATURE    The scientific advantages of all these researches have been great,  and, as nearly always happens, the practical consequences derived from  them have also been most important. It is owing to the more complete  knowledge of the general properties of fluids that immense progress  has been made these last few years in the methods of liquefying gases.    From a theoretical point of view the new processes of liquefaction can  be classed in two categories. Linde's machine and those resembling it  utilize, as is known, expansion without any notable production of  external work. This expansion, nevertheless, causes a fall in the  temperature, because the gas in the experiment is not a perfect gas,  and, by an ingenious process, the refrigerations produced are made  cumulative.    Several physicists have proposed to employ a method whereby  liquefaction should be obtained by expansion with recuperable external  work. This method, proposed as long ago as 1860 by Siemens, would  offer considerable advantages. Theoretically, the liquefaction would  be more rapid, and obtained much more economically; but unfortunately  in the experiment serious obstacles are met with, especially from the  difficulty of obtaining a suitable lubricant under intense cold for  those parts of the machine which have to be in movement if the  apparatus is to work.    M. Claude has recently made great progress on this point by the use,  during the running of the machine, of the ether of petrol, which is  uncongealable, and a good lubricant for the moving parts. When once  the desired region of cold is reached, air itself is used, which  moistens the metals but does not completely avoid friction; so that  the results would have remained only middling, had not this ingenious  physicist devised a new improvement which has some analogy with  superheating of steam in steam engines. He slightly varies the initial  temperature of the compressed air on the verge of liquefaction so as  to avoid a zone of deep perturbations in the properties of fluids,  which would make the work of expansion very feeble and the cold  produced consequently slight. This improvement, simple as it is in  appearance, presents several other advantages which immediately treble  the output.    The special object of M. Claude was to obtain oxygen in a practical  manner by the actual distillation of liquid air. Since nitrogen boils  at -194 deg. and oxygen at -180.5 deg. C., if liquid air be evaporated, the  nitrogen escapes, especially at the commencement of the evaporation,  while the oxygen concentrates in the residual liquid, which finally  consists of pure oxygen, while at the same time the temperature rises  to the boiling-point (-180.5 deg. C.) of oxygen. But liquid air is costly,  and if one were content to evaporate it for the purpose of collecting  a part of the oxygen in the residuum, the process would have a very  poor result from the commercial point of view. As early as 1892, Mr  Parkinson thought of improving the output by recovering the cold  produced by liquid air during its evaporation; but an incorrect idea,  which seems to have resulted from certain experiments of Dewar--the  idea that the phenomenon of the liquefaction of air would not be,  owing to certain peculiarities, the exact converse of that of  vaporization--led to the employment of very imperfect apparatus. M.  Claude, however, by making use of a method which he calls the  reversal[8] method, obtains a complete rectification in a remarkably  simple manner and under extremely advantageous economic conditions.  Apparatus, of surprisingly reduced dimensions but of great efficiency,  is now in daily work, which easily enables more than a thousand cubic  metres of oxygen to be obtained at the rate, per horse-power, of more  than a cubic metre per hour.    [Footnote 8: Methode avec retour en arriere.--ED]    It is in England, thanks to the skill of Sir James Dewar and his  pupils--thanks also, it must be said, to the generosity of the Royal  Institution, which has devoted considerable sums to these costly  experiments--that the most numerous and systematic researches have  been effected on the production of intense cold. I shall here note  only the more important results, especially those relating to the  properties of bodies at low temperatures.    Their electrical properties, in particular, undergo some interesting  modifications. The order which metals assume in point of conductivity  is no longer the same as at ordinary temperatures. Thus at -200 deg. C.  copper is a better conductor than silver. The resistance diminishes  with the temperature, and, down to about -200 deg., this diminution is  almost linear, and it would seem that the resistance tends towards  zero when the temperature approaches the absolute zero. But, after  -200 deg., the pattern of the curves changes, and it is easy to foresee  that at absolute zero the resistivities of all metals would still  have, contrary to what was formerly supposed, a notable value.  Solidified electrolytes which, at temperatures far below their fusion  point, still retain a very appreciable conductivity, become, on the  contrary, perfect insulators at low temperatures. Their dielectric  constants assume relatively high values. MM. Curie and Compan, who  have studied this question from their own point of view, have noted,  moreover, that the specific inductive capacity changes considerably  with the temperature.    In the same way, magnetic properties have been studied. A very  interesting result is that found in oxygen: the magnetic  susceptibility of this body increases at the moment of liquefaction.  Nevertheless, this increase, which is enormous (since the  susceptibility becomes sixteen hundred times greater than it was at  first), if we take it in connection with equal volumes, is much less  considerable if taken in equal masses. It must be concluded from this  fact that the magnetic properties apparently do not belong to the  molecules themselves, but depend on their state of aggregation.    The mechanical properties of bodies also undergo important  modifications. In general, their cohesion is greatly increased, and  the dilatation produced by slight changes of temperature is  considerable. Sir James Dewar has effected careful measurements of the  dilatation of certain bodies at low temperatures: for example, of ice.  Changes in colour occur, and vermilion and iodide of mercury pass into  pale orange. Phosphorescence becomes more intense, and most bodies of  complex structure--milk, eggs, feathers, cotton, and flowers--become  phosphorescent. The same is the case with certain simple bodies, such  as oxygen, which is transformed into ozone and emits a white light in  the process.    Chemical affinity is almost put an end to; phosphorus and potassium  remain inert in liquid oxygen. It should, however, be noted, and this  remark has doubtless some interest for the theories of photographic  action, that photographic substances retain, even at the temperature  of liquid hydrogen, a very considerable part of their sensitiveness to  light.    Sir James Dewar has made some important applications of low  temperatures in chemical analysis; he also utilizes them to create a  vacuum. His researches have, in fact, proved that the pressure of air  congealed by liquid hydrogen cannot exceed the millionth of an  atmosphere. We have, then, in this process, an original and rapid  means of creating an excellent vacuum in apparatus of very different  kinds--a means which, in certain cases, may be particularly  convenient.[9]    [Footnote 9: Professor Soddy, in a paper read before the Royal Society  on the 15th November 1906, warns experimenters against vacua created  by charcoal cooled in liquid air (the method referred-to in the text),  unless as much of the air as possible is first removed with a pump and  replaced by some argon-free gas. According to him, neither helium nor  argon is absorbed by charcoal. By the use of electrically-heated  calcium, he claims to have produced an almost perfect vacuum.--ED.]    Thanks to these studies, a considerable field has been opened up for  biological research, but in this, which is not our subject, I shall  notice one point only. It has been proved that vital germs--bacteria,  for example-"]]]
