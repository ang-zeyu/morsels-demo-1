She  drank of it deep and was glad and rose up like a giant refreshed.           *       *       *       *       *    We have seen that to make up a heroic age there must be two factors, the  new and the old; the young, vigorous, warlike people must seize on,  appropriate, in part assimilate, an old and wealthy civilization. It  almost seems as if we might go a step farther, and say that for every  great movement in art or literature we must have the same conditions, a  contact of new and old, of a new spirit seizing or appropriated by an  old established order. Anyhow for Athens the historical fact stands  certain. The amazing development of the fifth-century drama is just  this, the old vessel of the ritual Dithyramb filled to the full with the  new wine of the heroic _saga_; and it would seem that it was by the hand  of Peisistratos, the great democratic tyrant, that the new wine was  outpoured.           *       *       *       *       *    Such were roughly the outside conditions under which the drama of art  grew out of the _dromena_ of ritual. The racial secret of the individual  genius of AEschylus and the forgotten men who preceded him we cannot hope  to touch. We can only try to see the conditions in which they worked and  mark the splendid new material that lay to their hands. Above all things  we can see that this material, these Homeric _saga_, were just fitted  to give the needed impulse to art. The Homeric _saga_ had for an  Athenian poet just that remoteness from immediate action which, as we  have seen, is the essence of art as contrasted with ritual.    Tradition says that the Athenians fined the dramatic poet Phrynichus for  choosing as the plot of one of his tragedies the Taking of Miletus.  Probably the fine was inflicted for political party reasons, and had  nothing whatever to do with the question of whether the subject was  \"artistic\" or not. But the story may stand, and indeed was later  understood to be, a sort of allegory as to the attitude of art towards  life. To understand and still more to contemplate life you must come out  from the choral dance of life and stand apart. In the case of one's own  sorrows, be they national or personal, this is all but impossible. We  can ritualize our sorrows, but not turn them into tragedies. We cannot  stand back far enough to see the picture; we want to be doing, or at  least lamenting. In the case of the sorrows of others this standing back  is all too easy. We not only bear their pain with easy stoicism, but we  picture it dispassionately at a safe distance; we feel _about_ rather  than _with_ it. The trouble is that we do not feel enough. Such was the  attitude of the Athenian towards the doings and sufferings of Homeric  heroes. They stood towards them as spectators. These heroes had not the  intimate sanctity of home-grown things, but they had sufficient  traditional sanctity to make them acceptable as the material of drama.    Adequately sacred though they were, they were yet free and flexible. It  is impiety to alter the myth of your local hero, it is impossible to  recast the myth of your local daemon--that is fixed forever--his  conflict, his _agon_, his death, his _pathos_, his Resurrection and its  heralding, his Epiphany. But the stories of Agamemnon and Achilles,  though at home these heroes were local _daimones_, have already been  variously told in their wanderings from place to place, and you can  mould them more or less to your will. Moreover, these figures are  already personal and individual, not representative puppets, mere  functionaries like the May Queen and Winter; they have life-histories of  their own, never quite to be repeated. It is in this blend of the  individual and the general, the personal and the universal, that one  element at least of all really great art will be found to lie; and just  here at Athens we get a glimpse of the moment of fusion; we see a  definite historical reason why and how the universal in _dromena_ came  to include the particular in drama. We see, moreover, how in place of  the old monotonous plots, intimately connected with actual practical  needs, we get material cut off from immediate reactions, seen as it were  at the right distance, remote yet not too remote. We see, in a word, how  a ritual enacted year by year became a work of art that was a  \"possession for ever.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Possibly in the mind of the reader there may have been for some time a  growing discomfort, an inarticulate protest. All this about _dromena_  and drama and dithyrambs, bears and bulls, May Queens and Tree-Spirits,  even about Homeric heroes, is all very well, curious and perhaps even in  a way interesting, but it is not at all what he expected, still less  what he wants. When he bought a book with the odd incongruous title,  _Ancient Art and Ritual_, he was prepared to put up with some remarks on  the artistic side of ritual, but he did expect to be told something  about what the ordinary man calls art, that is, statues and pictures.  Greek drama is no doubt a form of ancient art, but acting is not to the  reader's mind the chief of arts. Nay, more, he has heard doubts raised  lately--and he shares them--as to whether acting and dancing, about  which so much has been said, are properly speaking arts at all. Now  about painting and sculpture there is no doubt. Let us come to business.    To a business so beautiful and pleasant as Greek sculpture we shall  gladly come, but a word must first be said to explain the reason of our  long delay. The main contention of the present book is that ritual and  art have, in emotion towards life, a common root, and further, that  primitive art develops normally, at least in the case of the drama,  straight out of ritual. The nature of that primitive ritual from which  the drama arose is not very familiar to English readers. It has been  necessary to stress its characteristics. Almost everywhere, all over the  world, it is found that primitive ritual consists, not in prayer and  praise and sacrifice, but in mimetic dancing. But it is in Greece, and  perhaps Greece only, in the religion of Dionysos, that we can actually  trace, if dimly, the transition steps that led from dance to drama, from  ritual to art. It was, therefore, of the first importance to realize the  nature of the dithyramb from which the drama rose, and so far as might  be to mark the cause and circumstances of the transition.    Leaving the drama, we come in the next chapter to Sculpture; and here,  too, we shall see how closely art was shadowed by that ritual out of  which she sprang.

We pass  from the living thing, the dance or the play acted by real people, the  thing _done_, whether as ritual or art, whether _dromenon_ or _drama_,  to the thing _made_, cast in outside material rigid form, a thing that  can be looked at again and again, but the making of which can never  actually be re-lived whether by artist or spectator.    Moreover, we come to a clear threefold distinction and division hitherto  neglected. We must at last sharply differentiate the artist, the work of  art, and the spectator. The artist may, and usually indeed does, become  the spectator of his own work, but the spectator is not the artist. The  work of art is, once executed, forever distinct both from artist and  spectator. In the primitive choral dance all three--artist, work of art,  spectator--were fused, or rather not yet differentiated. Handbooks on  art are apt to begin with the discussion of rude decorative patterns,  and after leading up through sculpture and painting, something vague is  said at the end about the primitiveness of the ritual dance. But  historically and also genetically or logically the dance in its  inchoateness, its undifferentiatedness, comes first. It has in it a  larger element of emotion, and less of presentation. It is this  inchoateness, this undifferentiatedness, that, apart from historical  fact, makes us feel sure that logically the dance is primitive.           *       *       *       *       *    To illustrate the meaning of Greek sculpture and show its close affinity  with ritual, we shall take two instances, perhaps the best-known of  those that survive, one of them in relief, the other in the round, the  Panathenaic frieze of the Parthenon at Athens and the Apollo Belvedere,  and we shall take them in chronological order. As the actual frieze and  the statue cannot be before us, we shall discuss no technical questions  of style or treatment, but simply ask how they came to be, what human  need do they express. The Parthenon frieze is in the British Museum, the  Apollo Belvedere is in the Vatican at Rome, but is readily accessible  in casts or photographs. The outlines given in Figs. 5 and 6 can of  course only serve to recall subject-matter and design.           *       *       *       *       *    The Panathenaic frieze once decorated the _cella_ or innermost shrine of  the Parthenon, the temple of the Maiden Goddess Athena. It twined like a  ribbon round the brow of the building and thence it was torn by Lord  Elgin and brought home to the British Museum as a national trophy, for  the price of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#19)"],[1,"to the Board of Trade Champlain dwelt upon the  advantages which were to be derived from fishing, from the lumber  industry, agriculture and cattle raising, and from the working of the  mines and from trading. In short he endeavoured to induce the associates  to continue their operations. The members, however, were under the  impression that colonization would place obstacles in the way of  commerce, and that the inhabitants would soon monopolize the trade. Some  of the associates who were Protestants objected to colonization under  Catholic influence, and understanding that Champlain was a staunch  Catholic, they decided to have Pont-Grave appointed as lieutenant of the  viceroy, in his place.    Champlain was much affected on finding that he had a rival in Pont-Grave  whom he had always respected as a father, neither would he accept such a  humiliating position. The king, however, intervened at this time, and  wrote a letter to the associates, requesting them to aid Champlain.         \"BY THE KING.         \"Dear, and well-beloved:--On the report made to us that       there has hitherto been bad management in the establishment of the       families and workmen sent to the settlement of Quebec, and other       places of New France, we write to you this letter, to declare to       you our desire that all things should proceed better in future; and       to tell you that it will give us pleasure that you should assist,       as much as you conveniently can, the Sieur Champlain in the things       requisite and necessary for the execution of the commands which he       has received from us, to choose experienced and trusty men to be       employed in the discovery, inhabiting, cultivating, and sowing the       lands; and do all the works which he shall judge necessary for the       establishment of the colonies which we desire to plant in the said       country, for the good of the service and the use of our subjects;       without, however, on account of the said discoveries and       settlements, your factors, clerks, and agents in the traffic of       peltry, being troubled or hindered in any way whatever during the       term which we have granted you. And fail not in this, for such is       our pleasure. Given at Paris March 12th, 1618.                                            (Signed) \"Louis.\"                                          (And below) \"Potier.\"    The merchants brought their affairs before the notice of the Council of  Tours, who decided that Champlain should retain his position. The action  of the council was a victory for Champlain, but it was soon followed by  another still more agreeable. The associates promised to provide for the  organization of emigration during the following year on a scale which  would assure the success of the settlement. By this arrangement eighty  persons, including three Recollet fathers would arrive in New France  during the year 1619. In order to have the proceedings regularly  conducted, Champlain caused papers to be prepared by notaries, which  were signed on December 21st, 1618, by Pierre du Gua and Lucas Legendre  in the name of the associates, and also by Vermeulle, Corneille de  Bellois and Mathieu d'Insterlo. The document is as follows:    \"List of persons to be sent to, and supported at, the settlement of  Quebec for the year 1619.    \"There shall be eighty persons, including the chief, three Recollet  fathers, clerks, officers, workmen and labourers. Every two persons  shall have a mattress, a paillasse, two blankets, three pairs of new  sheets, two coats each, six shirts, four pairs of shoes, and one capote.    \"For the arms:--Forty musquets, with their bandaliers, twenty-four  pikes, four arquebuses a rouet [wheel-lock] of four to five feet, one  thousand pounds of fine powder, one thousand pounds of powder for  common, six thousand pounds of lead, and a match-stump.    \"For the men:--A dozen scythes with their handles, hammers, and other  tools; twelve reaping-hooks, twenty-four spades, twelve picks, four  thousand pounds of iron, two barrels of steel, ten tons of lime [none  having been then found in this country], ten thousand curved, or twenty  thousand flat tiles, ten thousand bricks to build an oven and chimneys,  two mill-stones [the kind of stone fit for that purpose was not  discovered till some years afterwards.]    \"For the service of the table of the chief:--Thirty-six dishes, as many  bowls and plates, six saltcellars, six ewers, two basins, six pots of  six pints each, six pints, six chopines [about half a pint] six  demy-septiers, the whole of pewter, two dozen table-cloths, twenty-four  dozen napkins.    \"For the kitchen:--A dozen of copper boilers, six pairs andirons, six  frying-pans, six gridirons.    \"Shall also be taken out:--Two bulls of one year old, heifers, and as  many sheep as convenient; all kinds of seeds for sowing.    \"The commander of the settlement shall have charge of the arms and  ammunition which are actually there, and of those which shall afterwards  be sent, so long as he shall be in command; and the clerk or factor who  shall reside there shall take charge of all merchandise; as well as of  the furniture and utensils of the company, and shall send a regular  account of them, signed by him, by the ships.    \"Also shall be sent, a dozen mattresses complete, like those of  families, which shall be kept in the magazine for the use of the sick  and wounded, etc., etc.    \"Signed at Paris December 21st, 1618, and compared with the original [on  paper] by the undersigned.\"    Champlain submitted this document to the king, who approved it, but  nevertheless the associates were afterwards unwilling to fulfil its  conditions. The Prince de Conde having been discharged from prison on  October 20th, 1619, the king forwarded to him his commission of viceroy,  and the Company of Rouen granted him a thousand ecus.    The prince gave five hundred ecus to the Recollets for the construction  of a seminary at Quebec, and this was his only gift to the settlement of  New France. The prince afterwards sold his commission as viceroy to the  Duke of Montmorency, Admiral of France, for the sum of thirty thousand  ecus. Dolu, grand almoner of the kingdom, was appointed intendant. The  duke renewed Champlain's commission as lieutenant of the viceroy, and at  the same time advised him to return to Quebec to strengthen his  positions everywhere, in order that the country might be secure against  invasion.    The patronage of Montmorency greatly encouraged Champlain, for the duke  exercised great power. He therefore resolved to take his young wife to  Quebec with him, for she had never been to Canada. Champlain concluded  his private business in France, and took all his effects to the new  settlement, as he had determined to take up his residence there. Before  leaving France, all the difficulties in connection with his command were  removed, and the king wrote him a very gracious letter, in which His  Majesty expressed his esteem for his loyal and faithful subject.    The new administration of the Duke of Montmorency created  dissatisfaction amongst the merchants of the society, which in fact had  only changed its name of the \"Company of Rouen\" to the \"Company of  Montmorency or of de Caen.\" The associates forming the old company had  hoped that Champlain would have been placed in the shade, especially  when they learned that he intended to fortify Quebec and settle in the  country. No action, however, was taken until the new company had  commenced its administration. Champlain remained in ignorance of these  facts until the arrival of the vessels in the spring of 1621, when he  received letters from M. de Puiseux, _secretaire des commandements du  roi_, from the intendant Dolu, from de Villemenon, intendant of the  admiralty, from Guillaume de Caen, one of the members of the new  association, and from the viceroy, which last is here given:--         \"Monsieur Champlain: For many reasons I have thought fit       to exclude the former Company of Rouen and St. Malo from the trade       with New France, and to assist you and provide you with everything       necessary, I have chosen the Sieurs de Caen, uncle and nephew, and       their associates: one is a good merchant, and the other a good       naval captain, who can aid you well, and make the authority of the       king respected in my government. I recommend you to assist him and       those who shall apply to you on his part, so as to maintain them in       the enjoyment of the articles which I have granted them. I have       charged the Sieur Dolu, intendant of the affairs of the country, to       send you a copy of the treaty by the first voyage, so that you may       know to what they are bound, in order that they may execute their       engagement, as, on my part, I desire to perform what I have       promised.         \"I have taken care to preserve your appointments, as I believe you       will continue to serve the king well.         \"Your most affectionate and perfect friend,                                            \"Montmorency.         \"From Paris, February 2nd, 1621.\"    The letter of Louis XIII was also satisfactory:         \"Champlain: I have perceived by your letters of August       15th, with what affection you work at your establishment, and for       all that regards the good of my service: for which, as I am       thankful to you, so I shall have pleasure in recognizing it to your       advantage whenever the occasion shall offer: and I have willingly       granted some munitions of war, which were required to give you       better means to subsist and to continue in that good duty, which I       promise myself from your care and fidelity.\"         \"Paris, February 24th, 1621.                                            \"Louis.\"    It was in this manner that the sentence of death was given to the old  company.
