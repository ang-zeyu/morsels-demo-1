[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#19)"],[1,"book, all last winter in the evenings, and all the  summer when I wasn't teaching Latin to my two stupid children.  I just  finished it before college opened and sent it to a publisher.  He kept  it two months, and I was certain he was going to take it; but yesterday  morning an express parcel came (thirty cents due) and there it was back  again with a letter from the publisher, a very nice, fatherly  letter--but frank!  He said he saw from the address that I was still at  college, and if I would accept some advice, he would suggest that I put  all of my energy into my lessons and wait until I graduated before  beginning to write.  He enclosed his reader's opinion.  Here it is:    'Plot highly improbable.  Characterization exaggerated.  Conversation  unnatural.  A good deal of humour but not always in the best of taste.  Tell her to keep on trying, and in time she may produce a real book.'    Not on the whole flattering, is it, Daddy?  And I thought I was making  a notable addition to American literature.  I did truly.  I was  planning to surprise you by writing a great novel before I graduated.  I collected the material for it while I was at Julia's last Christmas.  But I dare say the editor is right.  Probably two weeks was not enough  in which to observe the manners and customs of a great city.    I took it walking with me yesterday afternoon, and when I came to the  gas house, I went in and asked the engineer if I might borrow his  furnace.  He politely opened the door, and with my own hands I chucked  it in.  I felt as though I had cremated my only child!    I went to bed last night utterly dejected; I thought I was never going  to amount to anything, and that you had thrown away your money for  nothing.  But what do you think?  I woke up this morning with a  beautiful new plot in my head, and I've been going about all day  planning my characters, just as happy as I could be.  No one can ever  accuse me of being a pessimist!  If I had a husband and twelve children  swallowed by an earthquake one day, I'd bob up smilingly the next  morning and commence to look for another set.                               Affectionately,                                                 Judy                                                         14th December    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I dreamed the funniest dream last night.  I thought I went into a book  store and the clerk brought me a new book named The Life and Letters of  Judy Abbott.  I could see it perfectly plainly--red cloth binding with  a picture of the John Grier Home on the cover, and my portrait for a  frontispiece with, 'Very truly yours, Judy Abbott,' written below.  But  just as I was turning to the end to read the inscription on my  tombstone, I woke up.  It was very annoying!  I almost found out whom  I'm going to marry and when I'm going to die.    Don't you think it would be interesting if you really could read the  story of your life--written perfectly truthfully by an omniscient  author?  And suppose you could only read it on this condition:  that  you would never forget it, but would have to go through life knowing  ahead of time exactly how everything you did would turn out, and  foreseeing to the exact hour the time when you would die.  How many  people do you suppose would have the courage to read it then? or how  many could suppress their curiosity sufficiently to escape from reading  it, even at the price of having to live without hope and without  surprises?    Life is monotonous enough at best; you have to eat and sleep about so  often.  But imagine how DEADLY monotonous it would be if nothing  unexpected could happen between meals.  Mercy!  Daddy, there's a blot,  but I'm on the third page and I can't begin a new sheet.    I'm going on with biology again this year--very interesting subject;  we're studying the alimentary system at present.  You should see how  sweet a cross-section of the duodenum of a cat is under the microscope.    Also we've arrived at philosophy--interesting but evanescent.  I prefer  biology where you can pin the subject under discussion to a board.  There's another!  And another!  This pen is weeping copiously.  Please  excuse its tears.    Do you believe in free will?  I do--unreservedly.  I don't agree at all  with the philosophers who think that every action is the absolutely  inevitable and automatic resultant of an aggregation of remote causes.  That's the most immoral doctrine I ever heard--nobody would be to blame  for anything.  If a man believed in fatalism, he would naturally just  sit down and say, 'The Lord's will be done,' and continue to sit until  he fell over dead.    I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to  accomplish--and that is the belief that moves mountains.  You watch me  become a great author!  I have four chapters of my new book finished  and five more drafted.    This is a very abstruse letter--does your head ache, Daddy?  I think  we'll stop now and make some fudge.  I'm sorry I can't send you a  piece; it will be unusually good, for we're going to make it with real  cream and three butter balls.                           Yours affectionately,                                                 Judy      PS.  We're having fancy dancing in gymnasium class.  You can see by the  accompanying picture how much we look like a real ballet.  The one at  the end accomplishing a graceful pirouette is me--I mean I.                                                         26th December    My Dear, Dear, Daddy,    Haven't you any sense?  Don't you KNOW that you mustn't give one girl  seventeen Christmas presents?  I'm a Socialist, please remember; do you  wish to turn me into a Plutocrat?    Think how embarrassing it would be if we should ever quarrel!  I should  have to engage a moving-van to return your gifts.    I am sorry that the necktie I sent was so wobbly; I knit it with my own  hands (as you doubtless discovered from internal evidence).  You will  have to wear it on cold days and keep your coat buttoned up tight.    Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times.  I think you're the sweetest man  that ever lived--and the foolishest!                                                       Judy      Here's a four-leaf clover from Camp McBride to bring you good luck for  the New Year.                                                             9th January    Do you wish to do something, Daddy, that will ensure your eternal  salvation?  There is a family here who are in awfully desperate  straits.  A mother and father and four visible children--the two older  boys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune and have not  sent any of it back.  The father worked in a glass factory and got  consumption--it's awfully unhealthy work--and now has been sent away to  a hospital.  That took all their savings, and the support of the family  falls upon the oldest daughter, who is twenty-four. She dressmakes for  $1.50 a day (when she can get it) and embroiders centrepieces in the  evening.  The mother isn't very strong and is extremely ineffectual and  pious.  She sits with her hands folded, a picture of patient  resignation, while the daughter kills herself with overwork and  responsibility and worry; she doesn't see how they are going to get  through the rest of the winter--and I don't either.  One hundred  dollars would buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that  they could go to school, and give a little margin so that she needn't  worry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn't get work.    You are the richest man I know.  Don't you suppose you could spare one  hundred dollars?  That girl deserves help a lot more than I ever did.  I wouldn't ask it except for the girl; I don't care much what happens  to the mother--she is such a jelly-fish.    The way people are for ever rolling their eyes to heaven and saying,  'Perhaps it's all for the best,' when they are perfectly dead sure it's  not, makes me enraged.  Humility or resignation or whatever you choose  to call it, is simply impotent inertia.  I'm for a more militant  religion!    We are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophy--all of  Schopenhauer for tomorrow.  The professor doesn't seem to realize that  we are taking any other subject.  He's a queer old duck; he goes about  with his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly when occasionally he  strikes solid earth.  He tries to lighten his lectures with an  occasional witticism--and we do our best to smile, but I assure you his  jokes are no laughing matter.  He spends his entire time between  classes in trying to figure out whether matter really exists or whether  he only thinks it exists.    I'm sure my sewing girl hasn't any doubt but that it exists!    Where do you think my new novel is?  In the waste-basket. I can see  myself that it's no good on earth, and when a loving author realizes  that, what WOULD be the judgment of a critical public?                                                             Later    I address you, Daddy, from a bed of pain.  For two days I've been laid  up with swollen tonsils; I can just swallow hot milk, and that is all.  'What were your parents thinking of not to have those tonsils out when  you were a baby?' the doctor wished to know.  I'm sure I haven't an  idea, but I doubt if they were thinking much about me.                                       Yours,                                                 J. A.                                                             Next morning    I just read this over before sealing it.  I don't know WHY I cast such  a misty atmosphere over life.  I hasten to assure you that I am young  and happy and exuberant; and I trust you are the same.  Youth has  nothing to do with birthdays, only with ALIVEDNESS of spirit, so even  if your hair is grey, Daddy, you can still be a boy.                               Affectionately,                                                     Judy         "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15707"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. I (#19)"],[1,"exertion, by which the  sensorial power becomes accumulated, this cold paroxysm should be prevented  by stimulant medicines and diet, as wine, opium, bark, warmth,  cheerfulness, anger, surprise.    4. Excite into greater action some other part of the system, by which means  the spirit of animation may be in part expended, and thence the inordinate  actions of the diseased part may be lessened. Hence when a part of the skin  acts violently, as of the face in the eruption of the small-pox, if the  feet be cold they should be covered. Hence the use of a blister applied  near a topical inflammation. Hence opium and warm bath relieve pains both  from excess and defect of stimulus.    5. First increase the general stimulation above its natural quantity, which  may in some degree exhaust the spirit of animation, and then decrease the  stimulation beneath its natural quantity. Hence after sudorific medicines  and warm air, the application of refrigerants may have greater effect, if  they could be administered without danger of producing too great torpor of  some part of the system; as frequently happens to people in health from  coming out of a warm room into the cold air, by which a topical  inflammation in consequence of torpor of the mucous membrane of the nostril  is produced, and is termed a cold in the head.    VII. _Cure of decreased Exertion._    1. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much decreased, as in the  cold fits of fever, a gradual accumulation of the spirit of animation takes  place; as occurs in all cases where inactivity or torpor of a part of the  system exists; this accumulation of sensorial power increases, till stimuli  less than natural are sufficient to throw it into action, then the cold fit  ceases; and from the action of the natural stimuli a hot one succeeds with  increased activity of the whole system.    So in fainting fits, or syncope, there is a temporary deficiency of  sensorial exertion, and a consequent quiescence of a great part of the  system. This quiescence continues, till the sensorial power becomes again  accumulated in the torpid organs; and then the usual diurnal stimuli excite  the revivescent parts again into action; but as this kind of quiescence  continues but a short time compared to the cold paroxysm of an ague, and  less affects the circulatory system, a less superabundancy of exertion  succeeds in the organs previously torpid, and a less excess of arterial  activity. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 6.    2. In the diseases occasioned by a defect of sensorial exertion, as in cold  fits of ague, hysteric complaint, and nervous fever, the following means  are those commonly used. 1. Increase the stimulation above its natural  quantity for some weeks, till a new habit of more energetic contraction of  the fibres is established. This is to be done by wine, opium, bark, steel,  given at exact periods, and in appropriate quantities; for if these  medicines be given in such quantity, as to induce the least degree of  intoxication, a debility succeeds from the useless exhaustion of spirit of  animation in consequence of too great exertion of the muscles or organs of  sense. To these irritative stimuli should be added the sensitive ones of  cheerful ideas, hope, affection.    3. Change the kinds of stimulus. The habits acquired by the constitution  depend on such nice circumstances, that when one kind of stimulus ceases to  excite the sensorial power into the quantity of exertion necessary to  health, it is often sufficient to change the stimulus for another  apparently similar in quantity and quality. Thus when wine ceases to  stimulate the constitution, opium in appropriate doses supplies the defect;  and the contrary. This is also observed in the effects of cathartic  medicines, when one loses its power, another, apparently less efficacious,  will succeed. Hence a change of diet, drink, and stimulating medicines, is  often advantageous in diseases of debility.    4. Stimulate the organs, whose motions are associated with the torpid parts  of the system. The actions of the minute vessels of the various parts of  the external skin are not only associated with each other, but are strongly  associated with those of some of the internal membranes, and particularly  of the stomach. Hence when the exertion of the stomach is less than  natural, and indigestion and heartburn succeed, nothing so certainly  removes these symptoms as the stimulus of a blister on the back. The  coldness of the extremities, as of the nose, ears, or fingers, are hence  the best indication for the successful application of blisters.    5. Decrease the stimulus for a time. By lessening the quantity of heat for  a minute or two by going into the cold bath, a great accumulation of  sensorial power is produced; for not only the minute vessels of the whole  external skin for a time become inactive, as appears by their paleness; but  the minute vessels of the lungs lose much of their activity also by concert  with those of the skin, as appears from the difficulty of breathing at  first going into cold water. On emerging from the bath the sensorial power  is thrown into great exertion by the stimulus of the common degree of the  warmth of the atmosphere, and a great production of animal heat is the  consequence. The longer a person continues in the cold bath the greater  must be the present inertion of a great part of the system, and in  consequence a greater accumulation of sensorial power. Whence M. Pome  recommends some melancholy patients to be kept from two to six hours in  spring-water, and in baths still colder.    6. Decrease the stimulus for a time below the natural, and then increase it  above natural. The effect of this process, improperly used, is seen in  giving much food, or applying much warmth, to those who have been  previously exposed to great hunger, or to great cold. The accumulated  sensorial power is thrown into so violent exertion, that inflammations and  mortifications supervene, and death closes the catastrophe. In many  diseases this method is the most successful; hence the bark in agues  produces more certain effect after the previous exhibition of emetics. In  diseases attended with violent pain, opium has double the effect, if  venesection and a cathartic have been previously used. On this seems to  have been founded the successful practice of Sydenham, who used venesection  and a cathartic in chlorosis before the exhibition of the bark, steel, and  opiates.    7. Prevent any unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. Hence in fevers  with debility, a decumbent posture is preferred, with silence, little  light, and such a quantity of heat as may prevent any chill sensation, or  any coldness of the extremities. The pulse of patients in fevers with  debility increases in frequency above ten pulsations in a minute on their  rising out of bed. For the expenditure of sensorial power to preserve an  erect posture of the body adds to the general deficiency of it, and thus  affects the circulation.    8. The longer in time and the greater in degree the quiescence or inertion  of an organ has been, so that it still retains life or excitability, the  less stimulus should at first be applied to it. The quantity of stimulation  is a matter of great nicety to determine, where the torpor or quiescence of  the fibres has been experienced in a great degree, or for a considerable  time, as in cold fits of the ague, in continued fevers with great debility,  or in people famished at sea, or perishing with cold. In the two last  cases, very minute quantities of food should be first supplied, and very  few additional degrees of heat. In the two former cases, but little  stimulus of wine or medicine, above what they had been lately accustomed  to, should be exhibited, and this at frequent and stated intervals, so that  the effect of one quantity may be observed before the exhibition of  another.    If these circumstances are not attended to, as the sensorial power becomes  accumulated in the quiescent fibres, an inordinate exertion takes place by  the increase of stimulus acting on the accumulated quantity of sensorial  power, and either the paralysis, or death of the contractile fibres ensues,  from the total expenditure of the sensorial power in the affected organ,  owing to this increase of exertion, like the debility after intoxication.  Or, secondly, the violent exertions above mentioned produce painful  sensation, which becomes a new stimulus, and by thus producing  inflammation, and increasing the activity of the fibres already too great,  sooner exhausts the whole of the sensorial power in the acting organ, and  mortification, that is, the death of the part, supervenes.    Hence there have been many instances of people, whose limbs have been long  benumbed by exposure to cold, who have lost them by mortification on their  being too hastily brought to the fire; and of others, who were nearly  famished at sea, who have died soon after having taken not more than an  usual meal of food. I have heard of two well-attested instances of patients  in the cold fit of ague, who have died from the exhibition of gin and  vinegar, by the inflammation which ensued. And in many fevers attended with  debility, the unlimited use of wine, and the wanton application of  blisters, I believe, has destroyed numbers by the debility consequent to  too great stimulation, that is, by the exhaustion of the sensorial power by  its inordinate exertion.    Wherever the least degree of intoxication exists, a proportional debility  is the consequence; but there is a golden rule by which the necessary and  useful quantity of stimulus in fevers with debility may be ascertained.  When wine or beer are exhibited either alone or diluted with water, if the  pulse becomes slower the stimulus is of a proper quantity; and should be  repeated every two or three hours, or when the pulse again becomes quicker.
