I thought so! Some one of those gay gallants has been  beforehand with me. Tell me who--\"    But she broke from him, and passed him, and fled down the lane.    \"Mark it!\" cried he, after her. \"You shall rue the day when you despised  Eustace Leigh! Mark it, proud beauty!\" And he turned back to join  Campian, who stood in some trepidation.    \"You have not hurt the maiden, my son? I thought I heard a scream.\"    \"Hurt her! No. Would God that she were dead, nevertheless, and I by her!  Say no more to me, father. We will home.\" Even Campian knew enough of  the world to guess what had happened, and they both hurried home in  silence.    And so Eustace Leigh played his move, and lost it.    Poor little Rose, having run nearly to Chapel, stopped for very shame,  and walked quietly by the cottages which stood opposite the gate, and  then turned up the lane towards Moorwinstow village, whither she was  bound. But on second thoughts, she felt herself so \"red and flustered,\"  that she was afraid of going into the village, for fear (as she said to  herself) of making people talk, and so, turning into a by-path, struck  away toward the cliffs, to cool her blushes in the sea-breeze. And there  finding a quiet grassy nook beneath the crest of the rocks, she sat down  on the turf, and fell into a great meditation.    Rose Salterne was a thorough specimen of a West-coast maiden, full of  passionate impulsive affections, and wild dreamy imaginations, a fit  subject, as the North-Devon women are still, for all romantic and gentle  superstitions. Left early without mother's care, she had fed her fancy  upon the legends and ballads of her native land, till she believed--what  did she not believe?--of mermaids and pixies, charms and witches,  dreams and omens, and all that world of magic in which most of the  countrywomen, and countrymen too, believed firmly enough but twenty  years ago. Then her father's house was seldom without some merchant, or  sea-captain from foreign parts, who, like Othello, had his tales of--            \"Antres vast, and deserts idle,       Of rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads reach heaven.\"    And,--         \"And of the cannibals that each other eat,       The anthropophagi, and men whose heads       Do grow beneath their shoulders.\"    All which tales, she, like Desdemona, devoured with greedy ears,  whenever she could \"the house affairs with haste despatch.\" And when  these failed, there was still boundless store of wonders open to her in  old romances which were then to be found in every English house of the  better class. The Legend of King Arthur, Florice and Blancheflour, Sir  Ysumbras, Sir Guy of Warwick, Palamon and Arcite, and the Romaunt of the  Rose, were with her text-books and canonical authorities. And lucky it  was, perhaps, for her that Sidney's Arcadia was still in petto, or Mr.  Frank (who had already seen the first book or two in manuscript, and  extolled it above all books past, present, or to come) would have surely  brought a copy down for Rose, and thereby have turned her poor little  flighty brains upside down forever. And with her head full of these, it  was no wonder if she had likened herself of late more than once to some  of those peerless princesses of old, for whose fair hand paladins and  kaisers thundered against each other in tilted field; and perhaps she  would not have been sorry (provided, of course, no one was killed) if  duels, and passages of arms in honor of her, as her father reasonably  dreaded, had actually taken place.    For Rose was not only well aware that she was wooed, but found the said  wooing (and little shame to her) a very pleasant process. Not that she  had any wish to break hearts: she did not break her heart for any of her  admirers, and why should they break theirs for her? They were all very  charming, each in his way (the gentlemen, at least; for she had long  since learnt to turn up her nose at merchants and burghers); but one of  them was not so very much better than the other.    Of course, Mr. Frank Leigh was the most charming; but then, as a  courtier and squire of dames, he had never given her a sign of real  love, nothing but sonnets and compliments, and there was no trusting  such things from a gallant, who was said (though, by the by, most  scandalously) to have a lady love at Milan, and another at Vienna, and  half-a-dozen in the Court, and half-a-dozen more in the city.    And very charming was Mr. William Cary, with his quips and his jests,  and his galliards and lavoltas; over and above his rich inheritance;  but then, charming also Mr. Coffin of Portledge, though he were a little  proud and stately; but which of the two should she choose? It would be  very pleasant to be mistress of Clovelly Court; but just as pleasant to  find herself lady of Portledge, where the Coffins had lived ever since  Noah's flood (if, indeed, they had not merely returned thither after  that temporary displacement), and to bring her wealth into a family  which was as proud of its antiquity as any nobleman in Devon, and might  have made a fourth to that famous trio of Devonshire Cs, of which it is  written,--         \"Crocker, Cruwys, and Copplestone,       When the Conqueror came were all at home.\"    And Mr. Hugh Fortescue, too--people said that he was certain to become a  great soldier--perhaps as great as his brother Arthur--and that would  be pleasant enough, too, though he was but the younger son of an  innumerable family: but then, so was Amyas Leigh. Ah, poor Amyas! Her  girl's fancy for him had vanished, or rather, perhaps, it was very much  what it always had been, only that four or five more girl's fancies  beside it had entered in, and kept it in due subjection. But still, she  could not help thinking a good deal about him, and his voyage, and the  reports of his great strength, and beauty, and valor, which had already  reached her in that out-of-the-way corner; and though she was not in the  least in love with him, she could not help hoping that he had at least  (to put her pretty little thought in the mildest shape) not altogether  forgotten her; and was hungering, too, with all her fancy, to give him  no peace till he had told her all the wonderful things which he had seen  and done in this ever-memorable voyage. So that, altogether, it was no  wonder, if in her last night's dream the figure of Amyas had been even  more forward and troublesome than that of Frank or the rest.    But, moreover, another figure had been forward and troublesome enough in  last night's sleep-world; and forward and troublesome enough, too, now  in to-day's waking-world, namely, Eustace, the rejected. How strange  that she should have dreamt of him the night before! and dreamt, too,  of his fighting with Mr. Frank and Mr. Amyas! It must be a warning--see,  she had met him the very next day in this strange way; so the first half  of her dream had come true; and after what had past, she only had to  breathe a whisper, and the second part of the dream would come true  also. If she wished for a passage of arms in her own honor, she could  easily enough compass one: not that she would do it for worlds! And  after all, though Mr. Eustace had been very rude and naughty, yet still  it was not his own fault; he could not help being in love with her.  And--and, in short, the poor little maid felt herself one of the most  important personages on earth, with all the cares (or hearts) of the  country in her keeping, and as much perplexed with matters of weight as  ever was any Cleophila, or Dianeme, Fiordispina or Flourdeluce, in verse  run tame, or prose run mad.    Poor little Rose! Had she but had a mother! But she was to learn her  lesson, such as it was, in another school. She was too shy (too proud  perhaps) to tell her aunt her mighty troubles; but a counsellor she must  have; and after sitting with her head in her hands, for half-an-hour  or more, she arose suddenly, and started off along the cliffs towards  Marsland. She would go and see Lucy Passmore, the white witch; Lucy knew  everything; Lucy would tell her what to do; perhaps even whom to marry.    Lucy was a fat, jolly woman of fifty, with little pig-eyes, which  twinkled like sparks of fire, and eyebrows which sloped upwards and  outwards, like those of a satyr, as if she had been (as indeed she had)  all her life looking out of the corners of her eyes. Her qualifications  as white witch were boundless cunning, equally boundless good nature,  considerable knowledge of human weaknesses, some mesmeric power, some  skill in \"yarbs,\" as she called her simples, a firm faith in the virtue  of her own incantations, and the faculty of holding her tongue. By dint  of these she contrived to gain a fair share of money, and also (which  she liked even better) of power, among the simple folk for many miles  round. If a child was scalded, a tooth ached, a piece of silver was  stolen, a heifer shrew-struck, a pig bewitched, a young damsel crost in  love, Lucy was called in, and Lucy found a remedy, especially for the  latter complaint. Now and then she found herself on ticklish ground, for  the kind-heartedness which compelled her to help all distressed damsels  out of a scrape, sometimes compelled her also to help them into one;  whereon enraged fathers called Lucy ugly names, and threatened to send  her into Exeter gaol for a witch, and she smiled quietly, and hinted  that if she were \"like some that were ready to return evil for evil,  such talk as that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#19)"],[1,"to dispatch me and then to  leave at once for France. I would make it appear that he had succeeded.    Behold me, ten minutes later, driving slowly along a part of the  Thames Embankment which I chanced to remember, a gruesome passenger  riding behind me in the cab. I was reflecting as I kept a sharp look-out  for a spot which I had noted one day during my travels, how easily one  could commit murder in London, when a constable ran out and  intercepted me!    _Mon Deiu!_ how my heart leapt!    \"I'll trouble you for your name and number, my lad,\" he said.    \"What for?\" I asked, and remembering a rare fragment of idiom: \"What's  up with you?\" I added.    \"Your lamp's out!\" he cried, \"that's what's up with me!\"    \"Oh,\" said I, climbing from my seat--\"very well. I'm sorry. I didn't  know. But here is my license.\"    I handed him the little booklet and began to light my lamps, cursing  myself for a dreadful artist because I had forgotten to do so.    \"All right,\" he replied, and handed it back to me. \"But how the devil  you've managed to get _all_ your lamps out, I can't imagine!\"    \"This is my first job since dusk,\" I explained hurrying around to the  tail-light. \"And _he_ don't say much!\" remarked the constable.    I replaced my matches in my pocket and returned to the front of the  cab, making a gesture as of one raising a glass to his lips and  jerking my thumb across my shoulder in the direction of my unseen fare.    \"Oh, that's it!\" said the constable, and moved off.    Never in my whole career have I been so glad to see the back of any  man!    I drove on slowly. The point for which I was making was only some  three hundred yards further along, but I had noted that the constable  had walked off in the opposite direction. Therefore, arriving at my  destination--a vacant wharf open to the road--I pulled up and listened.    Only the wash of the tide upon the piles of the wharf was audible, for  the night was now far advanced.    I opened the door of the cab and dragged out \"Le Balafre.\" Right and  left I peered, truly like a stage villain, and then hauled my  unpleasant burden along the irregularly paved path and on to the  little wharf. Out in mid-stream a Thames Police patrol was passing,  and I stood for a moment until the creak of the oars grew dim.    Then: there was a dull splash far below ... and silence again.    Gaston Max had been consigned to a watery grave!    Returning again to the garage, I wondered very much who he had been,  this one, \"Le Balafre.\" Could it be that he was \"The Scorpion\"? I  could not tell, but I had hopes very shortly of finding out. I had  settled up my affairs with my landlady and had removed from my  apartments all papers and other effects. In the garage I had placed  a good suit of clothes and other necessities, and by telephone I had  secured a room at a West-End hotel.    The cab returned to the stable, I locked the door, and by the light  of one of the lamps, shaved off my beard and moustache. My uniform  and cap I hung up on the hook where I usually left them after working  hours, and changed into the suit which I had placed there in readiness.  I next destroyed all evidences of identity and left the place in a  neat condition. I extinguished the lamp, went out and locked the door  behind me, and carrying a travelling-grip and a cane I set off for my  new hotel.    Charles Malet had disappeared!          CHAPTER IV    I MEET AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE      On the corner opposite Dr. Stuart's establishment stood a house which  was \"to be let or sold.\" From the estate-agent whose name appeared  upon the notice-board I obtained the keys--and had a duplicate made of  that which opened the front door. It was a simple matter, and the  locksmith returned both keys to me within an hour. I informed the  agent that the house would not suit me.    Nevertheless, having bolted the door, in order that prospective  purchasers might not surprise me, I \"camped out\" in an upper room all  day, watching from behind the screen of trees all who came to the house  of Dr. Stuart. Dusk found me still at my post, armed with a pair of  good binoculars. Every patient who presented himself I scrutinized  carefully, and finding as the darkness grew that it became increasingly  difficult to discern the features of visitors, I descended to the front  garden and resumed my watch from the lower branches of a tree which  stood some twenty feet from the roadway.    At selected intervals I crept from my post and surveyed the lane upon  which the window of the consulting-room opened and also the path  leading to the tradesmen's entrance, from which one might look across  the lawn and in at the open study windows. It was during one of these  tours of inspection and whilst I was actually peering through a gap in  the hedge, that I heard the telephone bell. Dr. Stuart was in the  study and I heard him speaking.    I gathered that his services were required immediately at some  institution in the neighbourhood. I saw him take his hat, stick and  bag from the sofa and go out of the room. Then I returned to the front  garden of my vacant house.    No one appeared for some time. A policeman walked slowly up the road,  and flashed his lantern in at the gate of the house I had commandeered.  His footsteps died away. Then, faintly, I heard the hum of a powerful  motor. I held my breath. The approaching car turned into the road at  a point above me to the right, came nearer ... and stopped before Dr.  Stuart's door.    I focussed my binoculars upon the chauffeur.    It was the brown-skinned man! _Nom d'un nom!_ a _woman_ was descending  form the car. She was enveloped in furs and I could not see her face.  She walked up the steps to the door and was admitted.    The chauffeur backed the car into the lane beside the house.    My heart beating rapidly with excitement, I crept out by the further  gate of the drive, crossed the road at a point fifty yards above the  house and walking very quietly came back to the tradesmen's entrance.  Into its enveloping darkness I glided and on until I could peep across  the lawn.    The elegant visitor, as I hoped, had been shown, not into the ordinary  waiting-room but into the doctor's study. She was seated with her back  to the window, talking to a grey-haired old lady--probably the  doctor's housekeeper. Impatiently I waited for this old lady to depart,  and the moment that she did so, the visitor stood up, turned and ...  it was _Zara el-Khala!_    It was only with difficulty that I restrained the cry of triumph which  arose to my lips. On the instant that the study door closed, Zara  el-Khala began to try a number of keys which she took from her handbag  upon the various drawers of the bureau!    \"So!\" I said--\"they are uncertain of the drawer!\"    Suddenly she desisted, looking nervously at the open windows; then,  crossing the room, she drew the curtains. I crept out into the road  again and by the same roundabout route came back to the empty house.  Feeling my way in the darkness of the shrubbery, I found the motor  bicycle which I had hidden there and I wheeled it down to the further  gate of the drive and waited.    I could see the doctor's door, and I saw him returning along the road.  As he appeared, from somewhere---I could not determine from where--came  a strange and uncanny wailing sound, a sound that chilled me like an  evil omen.    Even as it died away, and before Dr. Stuart had reached his door I  knew what it portended--that horrible wail. Some one hidden I knew not  where, had warned Zara el-Khala that the doctor returned! But stay!  Perhaps that some one was the dark-skinned chauffeur!    How I congratulated myself upon the precautions which I had taken to  escape observation. Evidently the watcher had placed himself somewhere  where he could command a view of the front door and the road.    Five minutes later the girl came out, the old housekeeper accompanying  her to the door, the car emerged from the lane, Zara el-Khala  entered it and was driven away. I could see no one seated beside the  chauffeur. I started my \"Indian\" and leapt in pursuit.    As I had anticipated, the route was Eastward, and I found myself  traversing familiar ground. From the south-west to the east of London  whirled the big car of mystery--and I was ever close behind it.  Sometimes, in the crowded streets, I lost sight of my quarry for a  time, but always I caught up again, and at last I found myself whirling  along Commercial Road and not fifty yards behind the car.    Just by the canal bridge a drunken sailor lurched out in front of my  wheel, and only by twisting perilously right into a turning called, I  believe, Salmon Lane, did I avoid running him down.    _Sacre nom!_ how I cursed him! The lane was too narrow for me to turn  and I was compelled to dismount and to wheel my \"Indian\" back to the  highroad. The yellow car had vanished, of course, but I took it for  granted that it had followed the main road. At a dangerous speed,  pursued by execrations from the sailor and all his friends, I set off  east once more turning to the right down West India Dock Road.    Arriving at the dock, and seeing nothing ahead of me but desolation  and ships' masts, I knew that that inebriated pig had spoiled  everything! I could have sat down upon the dirty pavement and wept,  so mortified was I! For if Zara el-Khala had secured the envelope I  had missed my only chance.    However, _pardieu!_ I have said that despair is not permitted by the  Bureau. I rode home to my hotel, deep in reflection. Whether the girl  had the envelope or not, at least she had escaped detection by the  doctor; therefore if she had failed she would try again. I could sleep  in peace until the morrow.    Of the following day, which I spent as I had spent the preceding one,  I have nothing to record. At about the same time in the evening the  yellow car again rolled into view, and on this occasion I devoted all  my"]]]
