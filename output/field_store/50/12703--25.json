And lastly, Carley saw Glenn waiting for her,  watching her come, true in this very moment to his stern hope for her  and pride in her, as she dragged her weary, spent body toward him and  the bright fire.    By these signs, or the effect of them, Carley vaguely realized that she  was incalculably changing, that this Carley Burch had become a vastly  bigger person in the sight of her friends, and strangely in her own a  lesser creature.        CHAPTER VI    If spring came at all to Oak Creek Canyon it warmed into summer before  Carley had time to languish with the fever characteristic of early June  in the East.    As if by magic it seemed the green grass sprang up, the green buds  opened into leaves, the bluebells and primroses bloomed, the apple and  peach blossoms burst exquisitely white and pink against the blue sky.  Oak Creek fell to a transparent, beautiful brook, leisurely eddying in  the stone walled nooks, hurrying with murmur and babble over the little  falls. The mornings broke clear and fragrantly cool, the noon hours  seemed to lag under a hot sun, the nights fell like dark mantles from  the melancholy star-sown sky.    Carley had stubbornly kept on riding and climbing until she killed her  secret doubt that she was really a thoroughbred, until she satisfied her  own insistent vanity that she could train to a point where this outdoor  life was not too much for her strength. She lost flesh despite increase  of appetite; she lost her pallor for a complexion of gold-brown she knew  her Eastern friends would admire; she wore out the blisters and aches  and pains; she found herself growing firmer of muscle, lither of line,  deeper of chest. And in addition to these physical manifestations there  were subtle intimations of a delight in a freedom of body she had never  before known, of an exhilaration in action that made her hot and made  her breathe, of a sloughing off of numberless petty and fussy and  luxurious little superficialities which she had supposed were necessary  to her happiness. What she had undertaken in vain conquest of Glenn's  pride and Flo Hutter's Western tolerance she had found to be a  boomerang. She had won Glenn's admiration; she had won the Western  girl's recognition. But her passionate, stubborn desire had been  ignoble, and was proved so by the rebound of her achievement, coming  home to her with a sweetness she had not the courage to accept. She  forced it from her. This West with its rawness, its ruggedness, she  hated.    Nevertheless, the June days passed, growing dreamily swift, growing more  incomprehensibly full; and still she had not broached to Glenn the main  object of her visit--to take him back East. Yet a little while  longer! She hated his work and had not talked of that. Yet an honest  consciousness told her that as time flew by she feared more and more to  tell him that he was wasting his life there and that she could not bear  it. Still was he wasting it? Once in a while a timid and unfamiliar  Carley Burch voiced a pregnant query. Perhaps what held Carley back most  was the happiness she achieved in her walks and rides with Glenn. She  lingered because of them. Every day she loved him more, and yet--there  was something. Was it in her or in him? She had a woman's assurance of  his love and sometimes she caught her breath--so sweet and strong was  the tumultuous emotion it stirred. She preferred to enjoy while she  could, to dream instead of think. But it was not possible to hold a  blank, dreamy, lulled consciousness all the time. Thought would return.  And not always could she drive away a feeling that Glenn would never be  her slave. She divined something in his mind that kept him gentle and  kindly, restrained always, sometimes melancholy and aloof, as if he  were an impassive destiny waiting for the iron consequences he knew  inevitably must fall. What was this that he knew which she did not know?  The idea haunted her. Perhaps it was that which compelled her to use all  her woman's wiles and charms on Glenn. Still, though it thrilled her to  see she made him love her more as the days passed, she could not blind  herself to the truth that no softness or allurement of hers changed this  strange restraint in him. How that baffled her! Was it resistance or  knowledge or nobility or doubt?    Flo Hutter's twentieth birthday came along the middle of June, and all  the neighbors and range hands for miles around were invited to celebrate  it.    For the second time during her visit Carley put on the white gown that  had made Flo gasp with delight, and had stunned Mrs. Hutter, and had  brought a reluctant compliment from Glenn. Carley liked to create a  sensation. What were exquisite and expensive gowns for, if not that?    It was twilight on this particular June night when she was ready to go  downstairs, and she tarried a while on the long porch. The evening star,  so lonely and radiant, so cold and passionless in the dusky blue, had  become an object she waited for and watched, the same as she had come  to love the dreaming, murmuring melody of the waterfall. She lingered  there. What had the sights and sounds and smells of this wild canyon  come to mean to her? She could not say. But they had changed her  immeasurably.    Her soft slippers made no sound on the porch, and as she turned  the corner of the house, where shadows hovered thick, she heard Lee  Stanton's voice:    \"But, Flo, you loved me before Kilbourne came.\"    The content, the pathos, of his voice chained Carley to the spot. Some  situations, like fate, were beyond resisting.    \"Shore I did,\" replied Flo, dreamily. This was the voice of a girl who  was being confronted by happy and sad thoughts on her birthday.    \"Don't you--love me--still?\" he asked, huskily.    \"Why, of course, Lee! I don't change,\" she said.    \"But then, why--\" There for the moment his utterance or courage failed.    \"Lee, do you want the honest to God's truth?\"    \"I reckon--I do.\"    \"Well, I love you just as I always did,\" replied Flo, earnestly. \"But,  Lee, I love him more than you or anybody.\"    \"My Heaven! Flo--you'll ruin us all!\" he exclaimed, hoarsely.    \"No, I won't either. You can't say I'm not level headed. I hated to tell  you this, Lee, but you made me.\"    \"Flo, you love me an' him--two men?\" queried Stanton, incredulously.    \"I shore do,\" she drawled, with a soft laugh. \"And it's no fun.\"    \"Reckon I don't cut much of a figure alongside Kilbourne,\" said Stanton,  disconsolately.    \"Lee, you could stand alongside any man,\" replied Flo, eloquently.  \"You're Western, and you're steady and loyal, and you'll--well, some  day you'll be like dad. Could I say more?... But, Lee, this man is  different. He is wonderful. I can't explain it, but I feel it. He has  been through hell's fire. Oh! will I ever forget his ravings when he  lay so ill? He means more to me than just one man. He's American. You're  American, too, Lee, and you trained to be a soldier, and you would have  made a grand one--if I know old Arizona. But you were not called to  France.... Glenn Kilbourne went. God only knows what that means. But he  went. And there's the difference. I saw the wreck of him. I did a little  to save his life and his mind. I wouldn't be an American girl if I  didn't love him.... Oh, Lee, can't you understand?\"    \"I reckon so. I'm not begrudging Glenn what--what you care. I'm only  afraid I'll lose you.\"    \"I never promised to marry you, did I?\"    \"Not in words. But kisses ought to--?\"    \"Yes, kisses mean a lot,\" she replied. \"And so far I stand committed.  I suppose I'll marry you some day and be blamed lucky. I'll be happy,  too--don't you overlook that hunch.... You needn't worry. Glenn is in  love with Carley. She's beautiful, rich--and of his class. How could he  ever see me?\"    \"Flo, you can never tell,\" replied Stanton, thoughtfully. \"I didn't like  her at first. But I'm comin' round. The thing is, Flo, does she love him  as you love him?\"    \"Oh, I think so--I hope so,\" answered Flo, as if in distress.    \"I'm not so shore. But then I can't savvy her. Lord knows I hope so,  too. If she doesn't--if she goes back East an' leaves him here--I reckon  my case--\"    \"Hush! I know she's out here to take him back. Let's go downstairs now.\"    \"Aw, wait--Flo,\" he begged. \"What's your hurry?... Come-give me--\"    \"There! That's all you get, birthday or no birthday,\" replied Flo,  gayly.    Carley heard the soft kiss and Stanton's deep breath, and then footsteps  as they walked away in the gloom toward the stairway. Carley leaned  against the log wall. She felt the rough wood--smelled the rusty pine  rosin. Her other hand pressed her bosom where her heart beat with  unwonted vigor. Footsteps and voices sounded beneath her. Twilight had  deepened into night. The low murmur of the waterfall and the babble of  the brook floated to her strained ears.    Listeners never heard good of themselves. But Stanton's subtle doubt of  any depth to her, though it hurt, was not so conflicting as the ringing  truth of Flo Hutter's love for Glenn. This unsought knowledge powerfully  affected Carley. She was forewarned and forearmed now. It saddened her,  yet did not lessen her confidence in her hold on Glenn. But it stirred  to perplexing pitch her curiosity in regard to the mystery that seemed  to cling round Glenn's transformation of character. This Western girl  really knew more about Glenn than his fiancee knew. Carley suffered  a humiliating shock when she realized that she had been thinking of  herself, of her love, her life, her needs, her wants instead of Glenn's.  It took no keen intelligence or insight into human nature to see that  Glenn needed her more than she needed him.    Thus unwontedly stirred and upset and flung back upon pride of herself,  Carley went downstairs to meet the assembled company. And never had  she shown to greater contrast,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#19)"],[1,"prove this? If thy assertion is  based on hearsay, then mere words are unacceptable as a binding testimony;  but if thou deemest the Qur'an as the testimony, this would be a weighty  and evident proof.    Now consider the Revelation of the Bayan. If the followers of the Qur'an  had applied to themselves proofs similar to those which they advance for  the non-believers in Islam, not a single soul would have remained deprived  of the Truth, and on the Day of Resurrection everyone would have attained  salvation.    Should a Christian contend, 'How can I deem the Qur'an a testimony while I  am unable to understand it?' such a contention would not be acceptable.  Likewise the people of the Qur'an disdainfully observe, 'We are unable to  comprehend the eloquence of the verses in the Bayan, how can we regard it  as a testimony?' Whoever uttereth such words, say unto him, 'O thou  untutored one! By what proof hast thou embraced the Religion of Islam? Is  it the Prophet on whom thou hast never set eyes? Is it the miracles which  thou hast never witnessed? If thou hast accepted Islam unwittingly,  wherefore hast thou done so? But if thou hast embraced the Faith by  recognizing the Qur'an as the testimony, because thou hast heard the  learned and the faithful express their powerlessness before it, or if thou  hast, upon hearing the divine verses and by virtue of thy spontaneous love  for the True Word of God, responded in a spirit of utter humility and  lowliness--a spirit which is one of the mightiest signs of true love and  understanding--then such proofs have been and will ever be regarded as  sound.'          \"The recognition of Him Who is the Bearer of divine ...\"      The recognition of Him Who is the Bearer of divine Truth is none other  than the recognition of God, and loving Him is none other than loving God.  However, I swear by the sublime Essence of God--exalted and glorified be  He--that I did not wish my identity to be known by men, and gave  instructions that My name should be concealed, because I was fully aware  of the incapacity of this people, who are none other than those who have,  in reference to no less a person than the Apostle of God--incomparable as  He hath ever been--remarked, 'He is certainly a lunatic'.(69) If they now  claim to be other than those people, their deeds bear witness to the  falsity of their assertions. That which God testifieth is none other than  what His supreme Testimony testifieth. Were all the peoples of the world  to testify unto a thing and were He to testify unto another, His testimony  will be regarded as God's testimony, while aught else but Him hath been  and will ever be as naught; for it is through His might that a thing  assumeth existence.    Consider the extent of the adherence of these people to matters of faith.  When dealing with their own affairs they are well content with the  testimony of two just witnesses, and yet despite the testimony of so many  righteous men they hesitate to believe in Him Who is the Bearer of the  divine Truth.          \"The evidences which the people demanded from the ...\"      The evidences which the people demanded from the Apostle of God through  their idle fancy have mostly been rejected in the Qur'an, even as in the  Surih of the Children of Israel [Surih XVII] it hath been revealed: 'And  they say, by no means will we believe on thee till thou cause a fountain  to gush forth for us from the earth; or till thou have a garden of palm  trees and vines, and thou cause rivers to spring forth from the midst  thereof in abundance; or thou cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as  thou hast given out, in pieces; or thou bring God and the angels to vouch  for thee; or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend to heaven nor will  we believe in thine ascension, till thou send down to us a book which we  may read. Say, Praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a man, an apostle?'    Now be fair! The Arabs uttered such words, and now, prompted by thy  desire, thou dost demand yet other things? What is the difference between  thee and them? If thou dost ponder a while, it will be evident that it is  incumbent upon a lowly servant to acquiesce to whatever proof God hath  appointed, and not to follow his own idle fancy. If the wishes of the  people were to be gratified not a single disbeliever would remain on  earth. For once the Apostle of God had fulfilled the wishes of the people  they would unhesitatingly have embraced His Faith. May God save thee,  shouldst thou seek any evidence according to thy selfish desire; rather it  behooveth thee to uphold the unfailing proof which God hath appointed. The  object of thy belief in God is but to secure His good-pleasure. How then  dost thou seek as a proof of thy faith a thing which hath been and is  contrary to His good-pleasure?          \"Rid thou thyself of all attachments to aught except God, ...\"      Rid thou thyself of all attachments to aught except God, enrich thyself in  God by dispensing with all else besides Him, and recite this prayer:    Say: God sufficeth all things above all things, and nothing in the heavens  or in the earth or in whatever lieth between them but God, thy Lord,  sufficeth. Verily, He is in Himself the Knower, the Sustainer, the  Omnipotent.    Regard not the all-sufficing power of God as an idle fancy. It is that  genuine faith which thou cherishest for the Manifestation of God in every  Dispensation. It is such faith which sufficeth above all the things that  exist on the earth, whereas no created thing on earth besides faith would  suffice thee. If thou art not a believer, the Tree of divine Truth would  condemn thee to extinction. If thou art a believer, thy faith shall be  sufficient for thee above all things that exist on earth, even though thou  possess nothing.          \"It is recorded in a tradition that of the entire concourse of ...\"      It is recorded in a tradition that of the entire concourse of the  Christians no more than seventy people embraced the Faith of the Apostle  of God. The blame falleth upon their doctors, for if these had believed,  they would have been followed by the mass of their countrymen. Behold,  then, that which hath come to pass! The learned men of Christendom are  held to be learned by virtue of their safeguarding the teaching of Christ,  and yet consider how they themselves have been the cause of men's failure  to accept the Faith and attain unto salvation! Is it still thy wish to  follow in their footsteps? The followers of Jesus submitted to their  clerics to be saved on the Day of Resurrection, and as a result of this  obedience they eventually entered into the fire, and on the Day when the  Apostle of God appeared they shut themselves out from the recognition of  His exalted Person. Dost thou desire to follow such divines?    Nay, by God, be thou neither a divine without discernment nor a follower  without discernment, for both of these shall perish on the Day of  Resurrection. Rather it behooveth thee to be a discerning divine, or to  walk with insight in the way of God by obeying a true leader of religion.    In every nation thou beholdest unnumbered spiritual leaders who are bereft  of true discernment, and among every people thou dost encounter myriads of  adherents who are devoid of the same characteristic. Ponder for a while in  thy heart, have pity on thyself and turn not aside thine attention from  proofs and evidences. However, seek not proofs and evidences after thine  idle fancy; but rather base thy proofs upon what God hath appointed.  Moreover, know thou that neither being a man of learning nor being a  follower is in itself a source of glory. If thou art a man of learning,  thy knowledge becometh an honour, and if thou art a follower, thine  adherence unto leadership becometh an honour, only when these conform to  the good-pleasure of God. And beware lest thou regard as an idle fancy the  good-pleasure of God; it is the same as the good-pleasure of His  Messenger. Consider the followers of Jesus. They were eagerly seeking the  good-pleasure of God, yet none of them attained the good-pleasure of His  Apostle which is identical with God's good-pleasure, except such as  embraced His Faith.          \"Thy letter hath been perused. Were the truth of this ...\"      Thy letter hath been perused. Were the truth of this Revelation to be  fully demonstrated with elaborate proofs, all the scrolls that exist in  the heaven and on the earth would be insufficient to contain them.    However, the substance and essence of the subject is this, that there can  be no doubt that from everlasting God hath been invested with the  independent sovereignty of His exalted Being, and unto everlasting He will  remain inaccessible in the transcendent majesty of His holy Essence. No  creature hath ever recognized Him as befitteth His recognition, nor hath  any created being ever praised Him as is worthy of His praise. He is  exalted above every name, and is sanctified from every comparison. Through  Him all things are made known, while too lofty is His reality to be known  through anyone but Him. The process of His creation hath had no beginning  and can have no end, otherwise it would necessitate the cessation of His  celestial grace. God hath raised up Prophets and revealed Books as  numerous as the creatures of the world, and will continue to do so to  everlasting.    If thou art sailing upon the sea of God's Names, which are reflected in  all things, know thou that He is exalted and sanctified from being known  through His creatures, or being described by His servants. Everything thou  beholdest hath been called into being through the operation of His Will.  How can such a created thing, therefore, be indicative of His essential  oneness? God's existence in itself testifieth to His Own oneness, while  every created thing, by its very nature, beareth evidence that it hath  been fashioned by God. Such is the proof of consummate wisdom in"]]]
