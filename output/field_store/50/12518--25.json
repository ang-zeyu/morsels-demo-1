For the next few moments, naturally, I was pretty intent on lions.  Nevertheless a corner of my mind was aware of Memba Sasa methodically  picking away at the jammed rifle, and paying no attention whatever to  the beast. Also I heard Hill making picturesque remarks about his  gunbearer, who had bolted with his second gun.    The lioness charged very fast, but very straight, about in the tearing,  scrambling manner of a terrier after a thrown ball. I got in the first  shot as she came, the bullet ranging back from the shoulder, and Hill  followed it immediately with another from his.404 Jeffrey. She growled  at the bullets, and checked very slightly as they hit, but gave no other  sign. Then our second shots hit her both together. The mere shock  stopped her short, but recovering instantly, she sprang forward again.  Hill's third shot came next, and perceptibly slowed and staggered, but  did not stop her. By this time she was quite close, and my own third  shot reached her brain. She rolled over dead.    Decidedly she was a game beast, and stood more hammering than any other  lion I killed or saw killed. Before the final shot in the brain she had  taken one light bullet and five heavy ones with hardly a wince. Memba  Sasa uttered a loud grunt of satisfaction when she went down for good.  He had the Springfield reloaded and cocked, right at my elbow.    Hill's gunboy hovered uncertainly some distance in the rear. The sight  of the charging lioness had been too much for him and he had bolted. He  was not actually up a tree; but he stood very near one. He lost the gun  and acquired a swift kick.    Our friends and the men now came up. The dogs made a great row over the  dead lioness. She was measured and skinned to accompaniment of the usual  low-hummed chantings. We had with us a small boy of ten or twelve years  whose job it was to take care of the dogs and to remove ticks. In fact  he was known as the Tick Toto. As this was his first expedition afield,  his father took especial pains to smear him with fat from the lioness.  This was to make him brave. I am bound to confess the effect was not  immediate.          XIX.    THE DOGS.      I soon discovered that we were hunting lions with the assistance of the  dogs; not that the dogs were hunting lions. They had not lost any lions,  not they! My mental pictures of the snarling, magnificent king of beasts  surrounded by an equally snarling, magnificent pack vanished into thin  air.    Our system was to cover as much likely country as we could, and to let  the dogs have a good time. As I have before indicated, they were  thoroughly doggy dogs, and interested in everything--except able-bodied  lions. None of the stick-at-your-heels in their composition. They ranged  far and wide through all sorts of cover, seeking what they could find in  the way of porcupines, mongoose, hares, birds, cats, and whatever else  should interest any healthy-minded dog. If there happened to be any  lions in the path of these rangings, the dogs retired rapidly,  discreetly, and with every symptom of horrified disgust. If a dog came  sailing out of a thicket, ki-yi-ing agitatedly, and took up his  position, tail between his legs, behind his master, we knew there was  probably a lion about. Thus we hunted lions with dogs.    But in order to be fair to these most excellent canines, it should be  recorded that they recovered a certain proportion of their nerve after a  rifle had been fired. They then returned warily to the--not  attack--reconnaissance. This trait showed touching faith, and was a real  compliment to the marksmanship of their masters. Some day it will be  misplaced. A little cautious scouting on their part located the wounded  beast; whereupon, at a respectful distance, they lifted their voices. As  a large element of danger in case of a wounded lion is the uncertainty  as to his whereabouts, it will be seen that the dogs were very valuable  indeed. They seemed to know exactly how badly hit any animal might  happen to be, and to gauge their distance accordingly, until at last,  when the quarry was hammered to harmlessness, they closed in and began  to worry the nearly lifeless carcass. By this policy the dogs had a lot  of fun hunting on their own hook, preserved their lives from otherwise  inevitable extinction, and were of great assistance in saving their  masters' skins.    One member of the pack, perhaps two, were, however, rather pathetic  figures. I refer to the setters, Wayward and Girlie. Ranger, Ruby, Ben,  and Nero scampered merrily over the landscape after anything that  stirred, from field mice to serval cats. All was game to their catholic  tastes; and you may be sure, in a country like Africa, they had few dull  moments. But Wayward and Girlie had been brought up in a more exclusive  manner. Their early instincts had been supplemented by a rigorous early  training. Game to them meant birds, and birds only. Furthermore, they  had been solemnly assured by human persons in whom they had the utmost  confidence, that but one sequence of events was permissible or even  thinkable in the presence of game. The Dog at first intimation by scent  must convey the fact to the Man, must proceed cautiously to locate  exactly, must then stiffen to a point which he must hold staunchly, no  matter how distracting events might turn out, or how long an interval  might elapse. The Man must next walk up the birds; shoot at them,  perhaps kill one, then command the Dog to retrieve. The Dog must on no  account move from his tracks until such command is given. All the affair  is perfectly simple; but quite inflexible. Any variation in this  procedure fills the honest bird dog's mind with the same horror and  dismay experienced by a well-brought-up young man who discovers that he  has on shoes of the wrong colour. It isn't done, you know.    Consider, then, Wayward and Girlie in a country full of game birds. They  quarter wide to right, then cross to left, their heads high, their  feather tails waving in the most approved good form. When they find  birds they draw to their points in the best possible style; stiffen  out--and wait. It is now, according to all good ethics, up to the Man.  And the Man and his companions go right on by, paying absolutely no  attention either to the situation or one's own magnificent piece of  work! What is one to conclude? That our early training is all wrong?  that we are at one experience to turn apostate to the settled and only  correct order of things? Or that our masters are no gentlemen? That is a  pretty difficult thing, an impossible thing, to conclude of one's own  master. But it leaves one in a fearful state mentally; and one has no  idea of what to do!    Wayward was a perfect gentleman, and he played the game according to  the very best traditions. He conscientiously pointed every bird he could  get his nose on. Furthermore he was absolutely staunch, and held his  point even when the four non-bird dogs rushed in ahead of him. The  expression of puzzlement, grief, shock, and sadness in his eyes deepened  as bird after bird soared away without a shot. Girlie was more  liberal-minded. She pointed her birds, and backed Wayward at need, but  when the other dogs rushed her point, she rushed too. And when we swept  on by her, leaving her on point, instead of holding it quixotically, as  did Wayward, until the bird sneaked away, she merely waited until we  were out of sight, and then tried to catch it. Finally Captain D.  remarked that, lions or no lions, he was not going to stand it any  longer. He got out a shotgun, and all one afternoon killed grouse over  Wayward, to the latter's intense relief. His ideals had been  rehabilitated.          XX.    BONDONI.      We followed many depressions, in which might be lions, until about three  o'clock in the afternoon. Then we climbed the gently-rising long slope  that culminated, far above the plains, in the peak of a hill called  Bondoni. From a distance it was steep and well defined; but, like most  of these larger kopjes, its actual ascent, up to the last few hundred  feet, was so gradual that we hardly knew we were climbing. At the summit  we found our men and the bullock cart. There also stood an oblong  blockhouse of stone, the walls two feet thick and ten feet high. It was  entered only by a blind angle passage, and was strong enough,  apparently, to resist small artillery. This structure was simply an  ostrich corral, and bitter experience had shown the massive construction  absolutely necessary as adequate protection, in this exposed and  solitary spot, against the lions.    We had some tea and bread and butter, and then Clifford Hill and I set  out afoot after meat. Only occasionally do these hard-working settlers  get a chance for hunting on the plains so near them; and now they had  promised their native retainers that they would send back a treat of  game. To carry this promised luxury, a number of the villagers had  accompanied the bullock wagon. As we were to move on next day, it became  very desirable to get the meat promptly while still near home.    We slipped over to the other side, and by good fortune caught sight of a  dozen zebras feeding in scrub half-way down the hill. They were out of  their proper environment up there, but we were glad of it. Down on our  tummies, then, we dropped, and crawled slowly forward through the high,  sweet grasses. We were in the late afternoon shadow of the hill, and we  enjoyed the mild skill of the stalk. Taking advantage of every cover,  slipping over into little ravines, lying very flat when one of the  beasts raised his head, we edged nearer and nearer. We were already well  within range, but it amused us to play the game. Finally, at one hundred  yards, we came to a halt. The zebra showed very handsome at that range,  for even their smaller leg stripes were all plainly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14460"],[0,"Faust: a Tragedy [part 1], Translated from the German of Goethe (#19)"],[1,"thoughts,  Still through my brain backward and forward flitting,  Against my will!    _Chorus_.

I feel as if the organ's peal  My breath were stifling,  The choral chant  My heart were melting.    _Chorus_. Judex ergo cum sedebit,  Quidquid latet apparebit.  Nil inultum remanebit.    _Margery_.

Woe's thee!    _Chorus_. Quid sum miser tunc dicturus?  Quem patronum rogaturus?  Cum vix justus sit securus.    _Evil Spirit_. They turn their faces,  The glorified, from thee.

MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Mephistopheles_. Wouldst thou not like a broomstick, now, to ride on?  At this rate we are, still, a long way off;  I'd rather have a good tough goat, by half,  Than the best legs a man e'er set his pride on.    _Faust_. So long as I've a pair of good fresh legs to stride on,  Enough for me this knotty staff.  What use of shortening the way!  Following the valley's labyrinthine winding,  Then up this rock a pathway finding,  From which the spring leaps down in bubbling play,  That is what spices such a walk, I say!  Spring through the birch-tree's veins is flowing,  The very pine is feeling it;  Should not its influence set our limbs a-glowing?    _Mephistopheles_. I do not feel it, not a bit!  My wintry blood runs very slowly;  I wish my path were filled with frost and snow.  The moon's imperfect disk, how melancholy  It rises there with red, belated glow,  And shines so badly, turn where'er one can turn,  At every step he hits a rock or tree!  With leave I'll beg a Jack-o'lantern!  I see one yonder burning merrily.  Heigh, there! my friend! May I thy aid desire?  Why waste at such a rate thy fire?  Come, light us up yon path, good fellow, pray!    _Jack-o'lantern_. Out of respect, I hope I shall be able  To rein a nature quite unstable;  We usually take a zigzag way.    _Mephistopheles_. Heigh! heigh! He thinks man's crooked course to travel.  Go straight ahead, or, by the devil,  I'll blow your flickering life out with a puff.    _Jack-o'lantern_. You're master of the house, that's plain enough,  So I'll comply with your desire.  But see! The mountain's magic-mad to-night,  And if your guide's to be a Jack-o'lantern's light,  Strict rectitude you'll scarce require.    FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, JACK-O'LANTERN, _in alternate song_.        Spheres of magic, dream, and vision,      Now, it seems, are opening o'er us.      For thy credit, use precision!      Let the way be plain before us      Through the lengthening desert regions.        See how trees on trees, in legions,      Hurrying by us, change their places,      And the bowing crags make faces,      And the rocks, long noses showing,      Hear them snoring, hear them blowing![33]        Down through stones, through mosses flowing,      See the brook and brooklet springing.      Hear I rustling? hear I singing?      Love-plaints, sweet and melancholy,      Voices of those days so holy?      All our loving, longing, yearning?      Echo, like a strain returning      From the olden times, is ringing.        Uhu! Schuhu! Tu-whit! Tu-whit!      Are the jay, and owl, and pewit      All awake and loudly calling?      What goes through the bushes yonder?      Can it be the Salamander--      Belly thick and legs a-sprawling?      Roots and fibres, snake-like, crawling,      Out from rocky, sandy places,      Wheresoe'er we turn our faces,      Stretch enormous fingers round us,      Here to catch us, there confound us;      Thick, black knars to life are starting,      Polypusses'-feelers darting      At the traveller. Field-mice, swarming,      Thousand-colored armies forming,      Scamper on through moss and heather!      And the glow-worms, in the darkling,      With their crowded escort sparkling,      Would confound us altogether.        But to guess I'm vainly trying--      Are we stopping? are we hieing?      Round and round us all seems flying,      Rocks and trees, that make grimaces,      And the mist-lights of the places      Ever swelling, multiplying.    _Mephistopheles_. Here's my coat-tail--tightly thumb it!  We have reached a middle summit,  Whence one stares to see how shines  Mammon in the mountain-mines.    _Faust_. How strangely through the dim recesses  A dreary dawning seems to glow!  And even down the deep abysses  Its melancholy quiverings throw!  Here smoke is boiling, mist exhaling;  Here from a vapory veil it gleams,  Then, a fine thread of light, goes trailing,  Then gushes up in fiery streams.  The valley, here, you see it follow,  One mighty flood, with hundred rills,  And here, pent up in some deep hollow,  It breaks on all sides down the hills.  Here, spark-showers, darting up before us,  Like golden sand-clouds rise and fall.  But yonder see how blazes o'er us,  All up and down, the rocky wall!    _Mephistopheles_. Has not Sir Mammon gloriously lighted  His palace for this festive night?  Count thyself lucky for the sight:  I catch e'en now a glimpse of noisy guests invited.    _Faust_. How the mad tempest[34] sweeps the air!  On cheek and neck the wind-gusts how they flout me.    _Mephistopheles_. Must seize the rock's old ribs and hold on stoutly!  Else will they hurl thee down the dark abysses there.  A mist-rain thickens the gloom.  Hark, how the forests crash and boom!  Out fly the owls in dread and wonder;  Splitting their columns asunder,  Hear it, the evergreen palaces shaking!  Boughs are twisting and breaking!  Of stems what a grinding and moaning!  Of roots what a creaking and groaning!  In frightful confusion, headlong tumbling,  They fall, with a sound of thunder rumbling,  And, through the wreck-piled ravines and abysses,  The tempest howls and hisses.  Hearst thou voices high up o'er us?  Close around us--far before us?  Through the mountain, all along,  Swells a torrent of magic song.    _Witches_ [_in chorus_].  The witches go to the Brocken's top,      The stubble is yellow, and green the crop.      They gather there at the well-known call,      Sir Urian[85] sits at the head of all.      Then on we go o'er stone and stock:      The witch, she--and--the buck.    _Voice_. Old Baubo comes along, I vow!  She rides upon a farrow-sow.    _Chorus_. Then honor to whom honor's due!      Ma'am Baubo ahead! and lead the crew!      A good fat sow, and ma'am on her back,      Then follow the witches all in a pack.    _Voice_. Which way didst thou come?    _Voice_. By the Ilsenstein!  Peeped into an owl's nest, mother of mine!  What a pair of eyes!    _Voice_. To hell with your flurry!  Why ride in such hurry!    _Voice_. The hag be confounded!  My skin flie has wounded!    _Witches_ [_chorus]._ The way is broad, the way is long,      What means this noisy, crazy throng?      The broom it scratches, the fork it flicks,      The child is stifled, the mother breaks.    _Wizards_ [_semi-chorus_]. Like housed-up snails we're creeping on,  The women all ahead are gone.  When to the Bad One's house we go,  She gains a thousand steps, you know.    _The other half_. We take it not precisely so;  What she in thousand steps can go,  Make all the haste she ever can,  'Tis done in just one leap by man.    _Voice_ [_above_]. Come on, come on, from Felsensee!    _Voices_ [_from below_]. We'd gladly join your airy way.  For wash and clean us as much as we will,  We always prove unfruitful still.    _Both chorusses_. The wind is hushed, the star shoots by,      The moon she hides her sickly eye.      The whirling, whizzing magic-choir      Darts forth ten thousand sparks of fire.    _Voice_ [_from below_]. Ho, there! whoa, there!    _Voice_ [_from above_]. Who calls from the rocky cleft below there?    _Voice_ [_below_]. Take me too! take me too!  Three hundred years I've climbed to you,  Seeking in vain my mates to come at,  For I can never reach the summit.    _Both chorusses_. Can ride the besom, the stick can ride,      Can stride the pitchfork, the goat can stride;      Who neither will ride to-night, nor can,      Must be forever a ruined man.    _Half-witch_ [_below_]. I hobble on--I'm out of wind--  And still they leave me far behind!  To find peace here in vain I come,  I get no more than I left at home.    _Chorus of witches_. The witch's salve can never fail,      A rag will answer for a sail,      Any trough will do for a ship, that's tight;      He'll never fly who flies not to-night.    _Both chorusses_. And when the highest peak we round,      Then lightly graze along the ground,      And cover the heath, where eye can see,      With the flower of witch-errantry.             [_They alight_.]    _Mephistopheles._ What squeezing and pushing, what rustling and hustling!  What hissing and twirling, what chattering and bustling!  How it shines and sparkles and burns and stinks!  A true witch-element, methinks!  Keep close! or we are parted in two winks.  Where art thou?    _Faust_ [_in the distance_]. Here!    _Mephistopheles_. What! carried off already?  Then I must use my house-right.--Steady!  Room!  Squire Voland[36] comes.  Sweet people, Clear the ground!  Here, Doctor, grasp my arm! and, at a single bound;  Let us escape, while yet 'tis easy;  E'en for the like of me they're far too crazy.  See! yonder, something shines with quite peculiar glare,  And draws me to those bushes mazy.  Come! come! "]]]
