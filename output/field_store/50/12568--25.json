Clearly the wrong done could only be expiated by an equivalent sacrifice  of some kind on the part of the man, or the tribe--that is by the  offering to the totem-animal or to the corn-spirit of some victim whom  these nature powers in their turn could feed upon and assimilate. In  this way the nature-powers would be appeased, the sense of unity would  be restored, and the first At-one-ment effected.    It is hardly necessary to recite in any detail the cruel and hideous  sacrifices which have been perpetrated in this sense all over the world,  sometimes in appeasement of a wrong committed or supposed to have been  committed by the tribe or some member of it, sometimes in placation or  for the averting of death, or defeat, or plague, sometimes merely  in fulfilment of some long-standing custom of forgotten origin--the  flayings and floggings and burnings and crucifixions of victims without  end, carried out in all deliberation and solemnity of established  ritual. I have mentioned some cases connected with the sowing of the  corn. The Bible is full of such things, from the intended sacrifice of  Isaac by his father Abraham, to the actual crucifixion of Jesus by  the Jews. The first-born sons were claimed by a god who called himself  \"jealous\" and were only to be redeemed by a substitute. (1) Of the  Canaanites it was said that \"even their daughters they have BURNT in the  fire to their gods\"; (2) and of the King of Moab, that when he saw  his army in danger of defeat, \"he took his eldest son that should have  reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt-offering on the wall!\"  (3) Dr. Frazer (4) mentions the similar case of the Carthaginians  (about B.C. 300) sacrificing two hundred children of good family as a  propitiation to Baal and to save their beloved city from the assaults  of the Sicilian tyrant Agathocles. And even so we hear that on that  occasion three hundred more young folk VOLUNTEERED to die for the  fatherland.     (1) Exodus xxxiv. 20.     (2) Deut. xii. 31.     (3) 2 Kings iii. 27.     (4) The Golden Bough, vol. \"The Dying God,\" p. 167.      The awful sacrifices made by the Aztecs in Mexico to their gods  Huitzilopochtli, Texcatlipoca, and others are described in much detail  by Sahagun, the Spanish missionary of the sixteenth century. The victims  were mostly prisoners of war or young children; they were numbered by  thousands. In one case Sahagun describes the huge Idol or figure of the  god as largely plated with gold and holding his hands palm upward and in  a downward sloping position over a cauldron or furnace placed below. The  children, who had previously been borne in triumphal state on litters  over the crowd and decorated with every ornamental device of feathers  and flowers and wings, were placed one by one on the vast hands and  ROLLED DOWN into the flames--as if the god were himself offering them.  (1) As the procession approached the temple, the members of it wept and  danced and sang, and here again the abundance of tears was taken for a  good augury of rain. (2)     (1) It is curious to find that exactly the same story (of the  sloping hands and the children rolled down into the flames) is related  concerning the above-mentioned Baal image at Carthage (see Diodorus  Siculus, xx. 14; also Baring Gould's Religious Belief, vol. i, p. 375).     (2) \"A los ninos que mataban, componianlos en muchos atavios para  llevarlos al sacrificio, y llevabos en unas literas sobre los hombros,  estas literas iban adornadas con plumages y con flores: iban tanendo,  cantando y bailando delante de ellos... Cuando Ileviban los ninos a  matar, si llevaban y echaban muchos lagrimas, alegrabansi los que los  llevaban porque tomaban pronostico de que habian de tener muchas aguas  en aquel ano.\" Sahagun, Historia Nueva Espana, Bk. II, ch. i.      Bernal Diaz describes how he saw one of these monstrous figures--that  of Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, all inlaid with gold and precious  stones; and beside it were \"braziers, wherein burned the hearts of three  Indians, torn from their bodies that very day, and the smoke of them and  the savor of incense were the sacrifice.\"    Sahagun again (in Book II, ch. 5) gives a long account of the sacrifice  of a perfect youth at Easter-time--which date Sabagun connects with the  Christian festival of the Resurrection. For a whole year the youth had  been held in honor and adored by the people as the very image of the  god (Tetzcatlipoca) to whom he was to be sacrificed. Every luxury  and fulfilment of his last wish (including such four courtesans as he  desired) had been granted him. At the last and on the fatal day, leaving  his companions and his worshipers behind, be slowly ascended the Temple  staircase; stripping on each step the ornaments from his body; and  breaking and casting away his flutes and other musical instruments;  till, reaching the summit, he was stretched, curved on his back, and  belly upwards, over the altar stone, while the priest with obsidian  knife cut his breast open and, snatching the heart out, held it up, yet  beating, as an offering to the Sun. In the meantime, and while the heart  still lived, his successor for the next year was chosen.    In Book II, ch. 7 of the same work Sahagun describes the similar  offering of a woman to a goddess. In both cases (he explains) of young  man or young woman, the victims were richly adorned in the guise of the  god or goddess to whom they were offered, and at the same time great  largesse of food was distributed to all who needed. (Here we see the  connection in the general mind between the gift of food (by the gods)  and the sacrifice of precious blood (by the people).) More than once  Sahagun mentions that the victims in these Mexican ceremonials not  infrequently offered THEMSELVES as a voluntary sacrifice; and Prescott  says (1) that the offering of one's life to the gods was \"sometimes  voluntarily embraced, as a most glorious death opening a sure passage  into Paradise.\"     (1) Conquest of Mexico, Bk. I, ch. 3.      Dr. Frazer describes (1) the far-back Babylonian festival of the Sacaea  in which \"a prisoner, condemned to death, was dressed in the king's  robes, seated on the king's throne, allowed to issue whatever commands  he pleased, to eat, drink and enjoy himself, and even to lie with the  king's concubines.\" But at the end of the five days he was stripped  of his royal robes, scourged, and hanged or impaled. It is certainly  astonishing to find customs so similar prevailing among peoples so far  removed in space and time as the Aztecs of the sixteenth century A.D.  and the Babylonians perhaps of the sixteenth century B.C. But we know  that this subject of the yearly sacrifice of a victim attired as a  king or god is one that Dr. Frazer has especially made his own, and for  further information on it his classic work should be consulted.     (1) Golden Bough, \"The Dying God,\" p. 114. (See also S. Reinach,  Cults, Myths and Religion, p. 94) on the martyrdom of St. Dasius.      Andrew Lang also, with regard to the Aztecs, quotes largely from  Sahagun, and summarizes his conclusions in the following passage:  \"The general theory of worship was the adoration of a deity, first by  innumerable human sacrifices, next by the special sacrifice of a MAN for  the male gods, of a WOMAN for each goddess. (1) The latter victims were  regarded as the living images or incarnations of the divinities in, each  case; for no system of worship carried farther the identification of the  god with the sacrifice (? victim), and of both with the officiating pri   connection was emphasized by the priests wearing the newly-flayed skins  of the victims--just as in Greece, Egypt and Assyria, the fawn-skin  or bull-hide or goat-skin or fish-skin of the victims is worn by the  celebrants. Finally, an image of the god was made out of paste, and this  was divided into morsels and eaten in a hideous sacrament by those who  communicated.\" (2)     (1) Compare the festival of Thargelia at Athens, originally  connected with the ripening of the crops. A procession was formed and  the first fruits of the year offered to Apollo, Artemis and the Horae.  It was an expiatory feast, to purify the State from all guilt and avert  the wrath of the god (the Sun). A man and a woman, as representing  the male and female population, were led about with a garland of figs  (fertility) round their necks, to the sound of flutes and singing. They  were then scourged, sacrificed, and their bodies burned by the seashore.  (Nettleship and Sandys.)     (2) A Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. ii, p. 97.      Revolting as this whole picture is, it represents as we know a mere  thumbnail sketch of the awful practices of human sacrifice all over the  world. We hold up our hands in horror at the thought of Huitzilopochtli  dropping children from his fingers into the flames, but we have to  remember that our own most Christian Saint Augustine was content to  describe unbaptized infants as crawling for ever about the floor of  Hell! What sort of god, we may ask, did Augustine worship? The Being who  could condemn children to such a fate was certainly no better than the  Mexican Idol.    And yet Augustine was a great and noble man, with some by no means  unworthy conceptions of the greatness of his God. In the same way the  Aztecs were in many respects a refined and artistic people, and their  religion was not all superstition and bloodshed. Prescott says of them  (1) that they believed in a supreme Creator and Lord \"omnipresent,  knowing all thoughts, giving all gifts, without whom Man is as  nothing--invisible, incorporeal, one God, of perfect perfection and  purity, under whose wings we find repose and a sure defence.\" How can  we reconcile St. Augustine with his own devilish creed, or the religious  belief of the Aztecs with their unspeakable cruelties? Perhaps we can  only reconcile them by remembering out of what deeps of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#19)"],[1,"dense as Professor Peirce  proved the nucleus of this comet to be, its impact with the earth  would develop heat enough to melt and vaporize the hardest rocks.  Happily there is little fear of this: as Professor Newcomb says, \"So  small is the earth in comparison with celestial space, that if one  were to shut his eyes and fire at random in the air, the chance of  bringing down a bird would be better than that of a comet of any  kind striking the earth.\" Besides, we are not living under a  government of chance, but under that of an Almighty Father, who  upholdeth all things by the word of his power; and no world can come  to ruin till he sees that it is best.          [Page 135]  VIII.    THE PLANETS AS INDIVIDUALS.    \"Through faith we understand that the worlds [plural] were framed  by the word of God, so that things which were seen were not made  of things which do appear.\"--_Heb._ xi. 3.    [Page 136]  \"O rich and various man! Thou palace of sight and sound, carrying  in thy senses the morning, and the night, and the unfathomable  galaxy; in thy brain the geometry of the city of God; in thy heart  the power of love, and the realms of right and wrong. An individual  man is a fruit which it costs all the foregoing ages to form and  ripen. He is strong, not to do but to live; not in his arms, but  in his heart; not as an agent, but as a fact.\"--EMERSON.          [Page 137]  VII.    _THE PLANETS AS INDIVIDUALS._    How many bodies there may be revolving about the sun we have no  means to determine or arithmetic to express. When the new star  of the American Republic appeared, there were but six planets  discovered. Since then three regions of the solar system have been  explored with wonderful success. The outlying realms beyond Saturn  yielded the planet Uranus in 1781, and Neptune in 1846. The middle  region between Jupiter and Mars yielded the little planetoid Ceres  in 1801, Pallas in 1802, and one hundred and ninety others since.  The inner region between Mercury and the sun is of necessity full  of small meteoric bodies; the question is, are there any bodies  large enough to be seen?    The same great genius of Leverrier that gave us Neptune from the  observed perturbations of Uranus, pointed out perturbations in  Mercury that necessitated either a planet or a group of planetoids  between Mercury and the sun. Theoretical astronomers, aided by the  fact that no planet had certainly been seen, and that all asserted  discoveries of one had been by inexperienced observers, inclined  to the belief in a group, or that the disturbance was caused by  the matter reflecting the zodiacal light.    When the total eclipse of the sun occurred in 1878, [Page 138]  astronomers were determined that the question of the existence of an  intra-mercurial planet should be settled. Maps of all the stars in  the region of the sun were carefully studied, sections of the sky  about the sun were assigned to different observers, who should  attend to nothing but to look for a possible planet. It is now  conceded that Professor Watson, of Ann Arbor, actually saw the  sought-for body.      VULCAN.    The god of fire; its sign [Symbol], his hammer.    DISTANCE FROM THE SUN, 13,000,000 MILES. ORBITAL REVOLUTION, ABOUT  20 DAYS.      MERCURY.    The swift messenger of the gods; sign [Symbol], his caduceus.    DISTANCE FROM THE SUN, 35,750,000 MILES. DIAMETER, 2992 MILES.  ORBITAL REVOLUTION, 87.97 DAYS. ORBITAL VELOCITY, 1773 MILES PER  MINUTE. AXIAL REVOLUTION, 24H. 5M.    Mercury shines with a white light nearly as bright as Sirius; is  always near the horizon. When nearly between us and the sun, as  at D (Fig. 46, p. 113), its illuminated side nearly opposite to  us, we, looking from E, see only a thin crescent of its light.  When it is at its greatest angular distance from the sun, as A or  C, we see it illuminated like the half-moon. When it is beyond the  sun, as at E, we see its whole illuminated face like the full-moon.    The variation of its apparent size from the varying distance is  very striking. At its extreme distance from the earth it subtends  an angle of only five seconds; nearest to us, an angle of twelve  seconds. Its distance from the earth varies nearly as one to three,  and its apparent size in the inverse ratio.    [Page 139]  When Mercury comes between the earth and the sun, near the line  where the planes of their orbits cut each other by reason of their  inclination, the dark body of Mercury will be seen on the bright  surface of the sun. This is called a transit. If it goes across  the centre of the sun it may consume eight hours. It goes 100,000  miles an hour, and has 860,000 miles of disk to cross. The transit of  1818 occupied seven and a half hours. The transits for the remainder  of the century will occur:      November 7th   1881  |  November 10th   1894    May 9th        1891  |  November 4th    1901      VENUS.    Goddess of beauty; its sign [Symbol], a mirror.    DISTANCE FROM THE SUN, 66,750,000 MILES. DIAMETER, 7660 MILES.  ORBITAL VELOCITY, 1296 MILES PER MINUTE. AXIAL REVOLUTION, 23H.  21M. ORBITAL REVOLUTION, 224.7 DAYS.    This brilliant planet is often visible in the daytime. I was once  delighted by seeing Venus looking down, a little after mid-day  through the open space in the dome of the Pantheon at Rome. It  has never since seemed to me as if the home of all the gods was  deserted. Phoebus, Diana, Venus and the rest, thronged through  that open upper door at noon of night or day. Arago relates that  Bonaparte, upon repairing to Luxemburg when the Directory was about  to give him a _fete_, was much surprised at seeing the multitude  paying more attention to the heavens above the palace than to him  or his brilliant staff. Upon inquiry, he learned that these curious  persons were observing with astonishment a star which they supposed  to be that of the conqueror of Italy. The emperor himself was not  indifferent when [Page 140] his piercing eye caught the clear lustre  of Venus smiling upon him at mid-day.    This unusual brightness occurs when Venus is about five weeks before  or after her inferior conjunction, and also nearest overhead by  being north of the sun. This last circumstance occurs once in eight  years, and came on February 16th, 1878.    Venus may be as near the earth as 22,000,000 miles, and as far  away as 160,000,000. This variation of its distances from the earth  is obviously much greater than that of Mercury, and its consequent  apparent size much more changeable. Its greatest and least apparent  sizes are as ten and sixty-five (Fig. 53).    [Illustration: Fig. 53.--Phases of Venus, and Varions Apparent  Dimensions.]    When Copernicus announced the true theory of the solar system, he  said that if the inferior planets could be clearly seen they would  show phases like the moon. When Galileo turned the little telescope  he had made on Venus, he confirmed the prophecy of Copernicus.  Desiring to take time for more extended observation, and still be  able to assert the priority of his discovery, he published the  following anagram, in which his discovery was contained:    [Page 141]    \"Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur o. y.\"   (These unripe things are now vainly gathered by me.)    He first saw Venus as gibbous; a few months revealed it as crescent,  and then he transposed his anagram into:      \"Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum.\"   (The mother of loves imitates the phases of Cynthia.)    Many things that were once supposed to be known concerning Venus are  not confirmed by later and better observations. Venus is surrounded  by an atmosphere so dense with clouds that it is conceded that  her time of rotation and the inclination of her axis cannot be  determined. She revealed one of the grandest secrets of the universe  to the first seeker; showed her highest beauty to her first ardent  lover, and has veiled herself from the prying eyes of later comers.    Florence has built a kind of shrine for the telescope of Galileo.  By it he discovered the phases of Venus, the spots on the sun,  the mountains of the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, and some  irregularities of shape in Saturn, caused by its rings. Galileo  subsequently became blind, but he had used his eyes to the best  purpose of any man in his generation.      THE EARTH.    Its sign [Symbol].    DISTANCE FROM THE SUN, 92,500,000 MILES. DIAMETER, POLAR, 7899  MILES; EQUATORIAL, 7925-1/2 MILES. AXIAL REVOLUTION, 23H. 56M.  4.09S.; ORBITAL, 365.86. ORBITAL VELOCITY PER MINUTE, 1152.8 MILES.    Let us lift ourselves up a thousand miles from the earth. We see it  as a ball hung upon nothing in empty space. As the drop of falling  water gathers itself [Page 142] into a sphere by its own inherent  attraction, so the earth gathers itself into a ball. Noticing  closely, we see forms of continents outlined in bright relief, and  oceanic forms in darker surfaces. We see that its axis of revolution  is nearly perpendicular to the line of light from the sun. One-half  is always dark. The sunrise greets a new thousand miles every hour;  the glories of [Page 143] the sunset follow over an equal space,  180 deg. behind. We are glad that the darkness never overtakes the  morning.    [Illustration: Fig. 54.--Earth and Moon in Space.]    _The Aurora Borealis._    While east and west are gorgeous with sunrise and sunset, the north  is often more glorious with its aurora borealis. We remember that  all worlds have weird and inexplicable appendages. They are not  limited to their solid surfaces or their circumambient air. The  sun has its fiery flames, corona, zodiacal light, and perhaps a  finer kind of atmosphere than we know. The earth is  [Page 144]  not without its inexplicable surroundings. It has not only its  gorgeous eastern sunrise, its glorious western sunset, high above  its surface in the clouds, but it also has its more glorious northern  dawn far above its clouds and air.
