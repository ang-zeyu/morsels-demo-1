Ed. Meyer saw       a connexion between this and the invasion of the People of       the Sea, which took place under Ramses III. I think that the       invasion of the Mushku was a purely local affair, and had       nothing in common with the general catastrophe occasioned by       the movement of the Asiatic armies.    A little later the Kashku, together with some Aramaeans, broke into  Shubarti, then subject to Assyria, and took possession of a part of it.  The majority of these invasions had, however, no permanent result: they  never issued in the establishment of an empire like that of the Khati,  capable by its homogeneity of offering a serious resistance to the march  of a conqueror from the south. To sum up the condition of affairs: if  a redistribution of races had brought about a change in Northern Syria,  their want of cohesion was no less marked than in the time of the  Egyptian wars; the first enemy to make an attack upon the frontier of  one or other of these tribes was sure of victory, and, if he persevered  in his efforts, could make himself master of as much territory as he  might choose. The Pharaohs had succeeded in welding together their  African possessions, and their part in the drama of conquest had  been played long ago; but the cities of the Tigris and the Lower  Euphrates--Nineveh and Babylon-were ready to enter the lists as soon as  they felt themselves strong enough to revive their ancient traditions of  foreign conquest.    The successors of Agumkakrime were not more fortunate than he had been  in attempting to raise Babylon once more to the foremost rank; their  want of power, their discord, the insubordination and sedition that  existed among their Cossaean troops, and the almost periodic returns of  the Theban generals to the banks of the Euphrates, sometimes even to  those of the Balikh and the Khabur, all seemed to conspire to aggravate  the helpless state into which Babylon had sunk since the close of the  dynasty of Uruazagga. Elam was pressing upon her eastern, and Assyria  on her northern frontier, and their kings not only harassed her with  persistent malignity, but, by virtue of their alliances by marriage with  her sovereigns, took advantage of every occasion to interfere both  in domestic and state affairs; they would espouse the cause of some  pretender during a revolt, they would assume the guardianship of such  of their relatives as were left widows or minors, and, when the occasion  presented itself, they took possession of the throne of Bel, or bestowed  it on one of their creatures. Assyria particularly seemed to regard  Babylon with a deadly hatred. The capitals of the two countries were not  more than some one hundred and eighty-five miles apart, the intervening  district being a flat and monotonous alluvial plain, unbroken by any  feature which could serve as a natural frontier. The line of demarcation  usually followed one of the many canals in the narrow strip of land  between the Euphrates and the Tigris; it then crossed the latter, and  was formed by one of the rivers draining the Iranian table-land,--either  the Upper Zab, the Radanu, the Turnat, or some of their ramifications in  the spurs of the mountain ranges. Each of the two states strove by every  means in its power to stretch its boundary to the farthest limits,  and to keep it there at all hazards. This narrow area was the scene of  continual war, either between the armies of the two states or those of  partisans, suspended from time to time by an elaborate treaty which was  supposed to settle all difficulties, but, as a matter of fact, satisfied  no one, and left both parties discontented with their lot and jealous of  each other. The concessions made were never of sufficient importance  to enable the conqueror to crush his rival and regain for himself the  ancient domain of Khammurabi; his losses, on the other hand, were  often considerable enough to paralyse his forces, and prevent him from  extending his border in any other direction. When the Egyptians seized  on Naharaim, Assyria and Babylon each adopted at the outset a different  attitude towards the conquerors. Assyria, which never laid any permanent  claims to the seaboard provinces of the Mediterranean, was not disposed  to resent their occupation by Egypt, and desired only to make sure of  their support or their neutrality. The sovereign then ruling Assyria,  but of whose name we have no record, hastened to congratulate Thutmosis  III. on his victory at Megiddo, and sent him presents of precious vases,  slaves, lapis-lazuli, chariots and horses, all of which the Egyptian  conqueror regarded as so much tribute. Babylon, on the other hand, did  not take action so promptly as Assyria; it was only towards the latter  years of Thutmosis that its king, Karaindash, being hard pressed by the  Assyrian Assurbelnishishu, at length decided to make a treaty with the  intruder.*         * We have no direct testimony in support of this hypothesis,       but several important considerations give it probability. As       no tribute from Babylon is mentioned in the _Annals of       Thutmosis III_., we must place the beginning of the       relations between Egypt and Chaldaea at a later date. On the       other hand, Burnaburiash II., in a letter written to       Amenothes III., cites Karaindash as the first of _his       fathers,_ who had established friendly relations with _the       fathers_ of the Pharaoh, a fact which obliges us to place       the interchange of presents before the time of Amenothes       III.: as the reigns of Amenothes II. and of Thutmosis IV.       were both short, it is probable that these relations began       in the latter years of Thutmosis III.    The remoteness of Egypt from the Babylonian frontier no doubt relieved  Karaindash from any apprehension of an actual invasion by the Pharaohs;  but there was the possibility of their subsidising some nearer enemy,  and also of forbidding Babylonish caravans to enter Egyptian provinces,  and thus crippling Chaldaean commerce. Friendly relations, when once  established, soon necessitated a constant interchange of embassies and  letters between the Nile and the Euphrates. As a matter of fact, the  Babylonian king could never reconcile himself to the idea that Syria had  passed out of his hands. While pretending to warn the Pharaoh of Syrian  plots against him,* the Babylonians were employing at the same time  secret agents, to go from city to city and stir up discontent at  Egyptian rule, praising the while the great Cosssean king and his  armies, and inciting to revolt by promises of help never meant to be  fulfilled. Assyria, whose very existence would have been endangered by  the re-establishment of a Babylonian empire, never missed an opportunity  of denouncing these intrigues at head-quarters: they warned the royal  messengers and governors of them, and were constantly contrasting the  frankness and honesty of their own dealings with the duplicity of their  rival.         * This was done by Kurigalzu I., according to a letter       addressed by his son Burnaburiash to Amenothes IV.    This state of affairs lasted for more than half a century, during which  time both courts strove to ingratiate themselves in the favour of the  Pharaoh, each intriguing for the exclusion of the other, by exchanging  presents with him, by congratulations on his accession, by imploring  gifts of wrought or unwrought gold, and by offering him the most  beautiful women of their family for his harem. The son of Karaindash,  whose name still remains to be discovered, bestowed one of his daughters  on the young Amenothes III.: Kallimasin, the sovereign who succeeded  him, also sent successively two princesses to the same Pharaoh. But  the underlying bitterness and hatred would break through the veneer of  polite formula and protestations when the petitioner received, as the  result of his advances, objects of inconsiderable value such as a lord  might distribute to his vassals,'or when he was refused a princess of  solar blood, or even an Egyptian bride of some feudal house; at such  times, however, an ironical or haughty epistle from Thebes would recall  him to a sense of his own inferiority.    As a fact, the lot of the Cossaean sovereigns does not appear to have  been a happy one, in spite of the variety and pomposity of the titles  which they continued to assume. They enjoyed but short lives, and we  know that at least three or four of them--Kallimasin, Burnaburiash I.,  and Kurigalzu I. ascended the throne in succession during the forty  years that Amenothes III. ruled over Egypt and Syria.*         * The copy we possess of the Royal Canon of Babylon is       mutilated at this point, and the original documents are not       sufficiently complete to fill the gap. About two or three       names are missing after that of Agumkakrime, and the reigns       must have been very short, if indeed, as I think, Agumka-       krimi and Karaindash were both contemporaries of the earlier       Pharaohs bearing the name of Thutmosis. The order of the       names which have come down to us is not indisputably       established. The following order appears to me to be the       most probable at present:--         Karaindash. Kallimasin. Burnaburiash I. Kurigalzu I.       Burnaburiash II. Karakhardash. Kadashmankiiarbe I.       Nazibugas II.. Kurigalzu II. Nazimaruttasii. Kadashmanturgu.         This is, with a slight exception, the classification adopted       by Winckler, and that of Hilprecht differs from it only in       the intercalation of Kudurturgu and Shagaraktiburiash       between Burnaburiash II. and Karakhardash.    Perhaps the rapidity of this succession may have arisen from some  internal revolution or from family disturbances.

The Assyrian texts do not mention       his name, but they state that in 849 \"the twelve kings\"       fought against Shalmaneser, and, as we have already seen,       one of the twelve was King of Israel, here, therefore       necessarily Ahaziah, whose successor was Joram.    The Assyrians had, as usual, maltreated the Khati. After having pillaged  the towns of Carchemish and Agusi, they advanced on the Amanos, held  to ransom the territory of the Patina enclosed within the bend of the  Orontes, and descending upon Hamath by way of the districts of Iaraku  and Ashta-maku, they came into conflict with the army of the twelve  kings, though on this occasion the contest was so bloody that they were  forced to withdraw immediately after their success. They had to content  themselves with sacking Apparazu, one of the citadels of Arame, and  with collecting the tribute of Garparuda of the Patina; which done, they  skirted the Amanos and provided themselves with beams from its  cedars. The two following years were spent in harrying the people of  Paqarakhbuni, on the right bank of the Euphrates, in the dependencies  of the ancient kingdom of Adini (848 B.C.), and in plundering the  inhabitants of Ishtarate in the country of Iaiti, near the sources of  the Tigris (847 B.C.), till in 846 they returned to try their fortune  again in Syria. They transported 120,000 men across the Euphrates,  hoping perhaps, by the mere mass of such a force, to crush their enemy  in a single battle; but Ben-hadad was supported by his vassals, and  their combined army must have been as formidable numerically as that of  the Assyrians. As usual, after the engagement, Shalmaneser claimed  the victory, but he did not succeed in intimidating the allies or in  wresting from them a single rood of territory.*         * The care which the king takes to specify that \"with       120,000 men he crossed the Euphrates in flood-time\" very       probably shows that this number was for him in some respects       an unusual one.    Discouraged, doubtless, by so many fruitless attempts, he decided to  suspend hostilities, at all events for the present. In 845 B.C. he  visited Nairi, and caused an \"image of his royal Majesty\" to be carved  at the source of the Tigris close to the very spot where the stream  first rises. Pushing forward through the defiles of Tunibuni, he  next invaded Urartu, and devastated it as far as the sources of the  Euphrates; on reaching these he purified his arms in the virgin spring,  and offered a sacrifice to the gods. On his return to the frontier,  the chief of Dayaini \"embraced his feet,\" and presented him with some  thoroughbred horses. In 844 B.C. he crossed the Lower Zab and plunged  into the heart of Namri; this country had long been under Babylonian  influence, and its princes bore Semitic names. Mardukmudammiq, who was  then its ruler, betook himself to the mountains to preserve his life;  but his treasures, idols, and troops were carried off to Assyria, and  he was superseded on the throne by Ianzu, the son of Khamban, a noble  of Cossaean origin. As might be expected after such severe exertions,  Shalmaneser apparently felt that he deserved a time of repose, for his  chroniclers merely note the date of 843 B.C. as that of an inspection,  terminating in a felling of cedars in the Amanos. As a fact, there was  nothing stirring on the frontier. Chaldaea itself looked upon him as a  benefactor, almost as a suzerain, and by its position between Elam and  Assyria, protected the latter from any quarrel with Susa. The nations  on the east continued to pay their tribute without coercion, and Namri,  which alone entertained pretensions to independence, had just received  a severe lesson. Urartu had not acknowledged the supremacy of Assur,  but it had suffered in the last invasion, and Arame had shown no  further sign of hostility. The tribes of the Upper Tigris--Kummukh and  Adini--accepted their position as subjects, and any trouble arising  in that quarter was treated as merely an ebullition of local  dissatisfaction, and was promptly crushed. The Khati were exhausted by  the systematic destruction of their towns and their harvests. Lastly,  of the principalities of the Amanos, Gurgum, Samalla, and the Patina, if  some had occasionally taken part in the struggles for independence, the  others had always remained faithful in the performance of their duties  as vassals. Damascus alone held out, and the valour with which she had  endured all the attacks made on her showed no signs of abatement; unless  any internal disturbance arose to diminish her strength, she was likely  to be able to resist the growing power of Assyria for a long time to  come. It was at the very time when her supremacy appeared to be thus  firmly established that a revolution broke out, the effects of  which soon undid the work of the preceding two or three generations.  Ben-hadad, disembarrassed of Shalmaneser, desired to profit by the  respite thus gained to make a final reckoning with the Israelites. It  would appear that their fortune had been on the wane ever since the  heroic death of Ahab. Immediately after the disaster at Eamoth, the  Moabites had risen against Ahaziah,* and their king, Mesha, son of  Kamoshgad, had seized the territory north of the Arnon which belonged  to the tribe of Gad; he had either killed or carried away the Jewish  population in order to colonise the district with Moabites, and he had  then fortified most of the towns, beginning with Dhibon, his capital.  Owing to the shortness of his reign, Ahaziah had been unable to take  measures to hinder him; but Joram, as soon as he was firmly seated on  the throne, made every effort to regain possession of his province, and  claimed the help of his ally or vassal Jehoshaphat.**         * 2 Kings iii. 5. The text does not name Ahaziah, and it       might be concluded that the revolt took place under Joram;       the expression employed by the Hebrew writer, however,       \"when Ahab was dead... the King of Moab rebelled against the       King of Israel,\" does not permit of it being placed       otherwise than at the opening of Ahaziah's reign.         ** 2 Kings iii. 6, 7, where Jehoshaphat replies to Joram in       the same terms which he had used to Ahab. The chronological       difficulties induced Ed. Meyer to replace the name of       Jehoshaphat in this passage by that of his son Jehoram. As       Stade has remarked, the presence of two kings both bearing       the name of Jehoram in the same campaign against Moab would       have been one of those facts which strike the popular       imagination, and would not have been forgotten; if the       Hebrew author has connected the Moabite war with the name of       Jehoshaphat, it is because his sources of information       furnished him with that king's name.    The latter had done his best to repair the losses caused by the war with  Syria. Being Lord of Edom, he had been tempted to follow the example  of Solomon, and the deputy who commanded in his name had constructed a  vessel * at Ezion-geber \"to go to Ophir for gold;\" but the vessel was  wrecked before quitting the port, and the disaster was regarded by the  king as a punishment from Jahveh, for when Ahaziah suggested that the  enterprise should be renewed at their joint expense, he refused the  offer.** But the sudden insurrection of Moab threatened him as much as  it did Joram, and he gladly acceded to the latter's appeal for help.         * [Both in the Hebrew and the Septuagint the ships are in       the plural number in 1 Kings xxii. 48, 49.--Tr.]         ** 1 Kings xxii. 48, 49, where the Hebrew writer calls the       vessel constructed by Jehoshaphat a \"ship of Tarshish;\"       that is, a vessel built to make long voyages. The author of       the Chronicles thought that the Jewish expedition to Ezion-       geber on the Red Sea was destined to go to Tarshish in       Spain. He has, moreover, transformed the vessel into a       fleet, and has associated Ahaziah in the enterprise,       contrary to the testimony of the Book of Kings; finally, he       has introduced into the account a prophet named Eliezer, who       represents the disaster as a chastisement for the alliance       with Ahaziah (2 Ghron. xx. 35-37).    Apparently the simplest way of approaching the enemy would have been  from the north, choosing Gilead as a base of operations; but the line of  fortresses constructed by Mesha at this vulnerable point of his frontier  was so formidable, that the allies resolved to attack from the south  after passing the lower extremity of the Dead Sea. They marched for  seven days in an arid desert, digging wells as they proceeded for the  necessary supply of water. Mesha awaited them with his hastily assembled  troops on the confines of the cultivated land; the allies routed him  and blockaded him within his city of Kir-hareseth.* Closely beset, and  despairing of any help from man, he had recourse to the last resource  which religion provided for his salvation; taking his firstborn son, he  offered him to Chemosh, and burnt him on the city wall in sight of the  besiegers. The Israelites knew what obligations this sacrifice entailed  upon the Moabite god, and the succour which he would be constrained to  give to his devotees in consequence. They therefore raised the siege and  disbanded in all directions.** Mesha, delivered at the very moment that  his cause seemed hopeless, dedicated a stele in the temple of Dhibon, on  which he recorded his victories and related what measures he had taken  to protect his people.***         * Kir-Hareseth or Kir-Moab is the"]]]
