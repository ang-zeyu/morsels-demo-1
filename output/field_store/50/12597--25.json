A thorough cleansing of the  wound with a two per cent solution of Liquor Cresolis Compositus and  this followed by moistening every part of the wound with tincture of  iodin, will check all such disturbance if done promptly.    Where practically all of the anterior surface of the radius has been  denuded, recovery is tardy and there is in some cases imperfect  extension of the leg for months after the wound has healed. But in such  instances, animals gradually regain complete use of the affected member  and in the course of a year function is fully restored.      Inflammation and Contraction of the Carpal Flexors.    Anatomy.--The structures which are usually considered as true flexors  of the carpus are a group of three muscles, which have separate heads of  origin and different points of tendinous insertion.    The _flexor carpiradialis_ (flexor metacarpi internus) originates from  the medial epicondyle of the humerus. It is inserted to the proximal end  of the medial metacarpal (inner metacarpal or splint) bone. This muscle  is the smaller of the three and is not usually divided in doing carpal  tenotomy.    The _flexor carpiulnaris_ (flexor metacarpi medius) has two heads of  origin; one, the larger, originates from the epicondyle of the humerus  and the other from the posterior surface of the olecranon. The two  heads unite at the upper third of the radius and the muscle, becoming  tendinous, as is the case with the other carpal flexors, is attached by  one point of insertion to the accessory carpal bone (trapezum). The  other blends with the posterior annular ligament of the carpus.    The _ulnaris lateralis_ (flexor metacarpi externus) has its origin from  the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and inserts to the proximal  extremity of the fourth metacarpal (outer splint) bone and by another  attachment to the accessory carpal bone (trapezium) with the tendon of  the flexor carpiulnaris (flexor metacarpi medius).    Acting together, these muscles flex the carpus or extend the elbow and  this action is antagonized by the biceps brachii (flexor brachii) and  extensors of the carpus and phalanges.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Inflammation of the muscular or tendinous  parts of the carpal flexors, does not occur as frequently as does  inflammation of the flexors of the extremity. They are subject to injury  such as is occasioned by hard work and concussion and contract as a  result; but, more frequently a congenital malformation of the leg is  responsible for undue strain upon these parts. Horses that are \"knee  sprung\" or that have a congenital condition where in the anterior line,  as formed by the radius, carpal and metacarpal bones, is bent forward at  the carpus, are subject to inflammation and contraction of the carpal  flexors. When these flexors are contracted, the condition is commonly  known among horsemen as \"buck knee.\" In itself, inflammation of the  carpal flexors is not a condition which is likely to prove troublesome,  but because of carpal involvement (which is often present) the cause of  the trouble remains, and inflammation of the carpal flexors recurs or  becomes chronic and contraction of tendons results.    Symptomatology.--Inflammation of the carpal flexors, when acute and  uncomplicated, is characterized by a painfully swollen condition of the  affected tendons. No weight is borne upon the affected leg and the  carpal joint is flexed. Mixed lameness is present. There is no  difficulty encountered in arriving at a diagnosis because of the very  noticeably inflamed parts.    Many fully developed cases of contraction of the tendons of the carpal  flexors are observed where the condition has become established  gradually and no lameness has resulted from tendinitis or carpitis. In  some of these cases, subjects are stumblers and when they are carelessly  handled or kept at fast work over irregular or hard roads, chronic  carpitis with hyperplasia of the structures of the anterior carpal  region results, owing to frequent bruising from falls.    [Illustration: Fig. 10--Contraction of carpal flexors, \"knee sprung.\"]    Where inflammation is caused by a puncture wound and subfascial  infection occurs, there is evident manifestation of pain. No weight is  supported by the affected member and because of the pressure, occasioned  by the swollen muscles confined within the non-yielding brachial fascia,  there exists marked supersensitiveness of the affected parts. Flexion of  the elbow is avoided because contraction of the biceps brachii (flexor  brachii) or the extensors, which are antagonists of the flexors of the  carpus, tenses the carpal flexors and pain is thereby increased.    However, in most instances, the practitioner's attention is not directed  to typical and uncomplicated cases, but to subacute or chronic  inflammations which are often attended with contraction of the tendinous  parts of the carpal flexors, and in such cases carpitis is present.  Animals so affected have lost the rigidity which characterizes the  normal carpal joint when the leg is a weight bearing member, and because  of its sprung condition, the leg trembles when supporting weight.    Treatment.--Acute inflammation is treated by means of local  application of cold or hot packs until the pain and acute stage of  inflammation has subsided and later stimulating liniments are indicated.  Absolute quiet must be enforced. Especially where the carpus is involved  must the subject be kept quiet until all evidence of inflammation has  subsided.    The application of vesicants or line-firing is beneficial in subacute  inflammation of the tendons of the carpal flexors. Where contraction of  tendons exists and no osseous or ligamentous change prevents correction  of the condition, tenotomy is necessary. The reader is referred to  Merillat's \"Veterinary Surgery\"[17] for a good description of the  technic of this operation.    In all serious cases of inflammation of the carpal flexors, whether  tenotomy has been performed or not, the subject needs a long period of  rest subsequent to treatment. In fact, three or four months at pasture  is necessary to permit of recovery and this where no congenital  deformity has predisposed the subject to such affection of the flexors.  Return to work must be gradual and the character of the work such as to  enable the animal to become inured to service without a recurrence of  the trouble if possible.    It follows then, that tenotomy, here as in other cases, is not practical  from an economic viewpoint, unless the animal be of sufficient value to  justify the long period of rest for recovery. Tenotomy is not of  practical benefit unless ample time is allowed for regeneration of  divided tendinous tissue.      Fracture and Luxation of the Carpal Bones.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Fracture of the carpal bones is of  infrequent occurrence in horses and, when it does occur, it is usually  due to injuries, and because of their nature (resulting as they  generally do from heavy falls or in being run over by street cars or  wagons), a comminuted fracture of one or more bones exists. The  accessory carpal bone (trapezium) is said to be fractured at times  without being subjected to blows or like injuries, but this is  exceptional.    Luxations of the carpal joint are of rare occurrence, and very few cases  of this kind are on record. Walters[18] reports a case of  carpometacarpal luxation in a pony wherein reduction was spontaneous and  an uneventful recovery followed. His reason for reporting the case, as  he states, is its rarity.    Symptomatology.--Fractures of the carpal bones as they usually take  place are diagnosed without difficulty. Because of their usually being  comminuted, abnormal movement of the joint is possible. Such movement is  not restricted and flexion of the leg at the carpus in any direction is  possible. Crepitation is readily detected and frequently these fractures  are of the compound-comminuted variety.    In fracture of the accessory carpal bone (trapezium) or in fracture of  any other single bone when such exists, there is no increase in the  movement of the joint. The accessory carpal bone may be readily  manipulated and when fractured, its parts are more or less displaced.  Recognition of fracture of any other single carpal bone must be done by  detecting crepitation unless it be a compound fracture, whereupon  probing is of aid in establishing a diagnosis.    Carpal luxation when present is to be recognized by finding the apposing  carpal bones joined in an abnormal manner--that is, out of position.  There is restricted or suspended function of the joint, and in the cases  recorded, no difficulty has been experienced in making a diagnosis. The  carpometacarpal portion of the articulation is the part which is usually  affected.    Prognosis and Treatment.--There is no chance for complete recovery in  the usual case of carpal fracture because of the fact that there results  sufficient arthritis to destroy articular cartilage beyond repair. In  the average instance, because of arthritis which persists for a  considerable length of time, more or less ankylosis results. At best,  one can only hope for partial recovery, that is to say, the member may  regain its usefulness as a weight-supporting part, but because of  restricted or abolished joint function, locomotion is more or less  difficult. Exostoses, articular and periarticular, occur and the carpus  usually becomes a large immobile articulation. There is danger of  infection resulting in simple carpal fractures and, needless to say, in  a compound-comminuted fracture of the carpus, infection usually occurs  and a fatal outcome is probable.    When treatment is instituted, antiseptic precautions are taken in  handling "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#19)"],[1,"  violette, } from pomade, each,      1  \"  Extract of cassie,                          1/2  \"     \"       musk,      }     \"       ambergris, } of each,               2 oz.

Independently of the materials employed being different to the original  English recipe, it must be remembered that all the French perfumes are  made of brandy, _i.e._ grape spirit; whereas the English perfumes are  made with corn spirit, which alone modifies their odor. Though good for  some mixtures, yet for others the grape spirit is very objectionable, on  account of the predominance of its own aroma.    We have spoken of the difference in the odor between the English and  French spirit; the marked distinction of British and Parisian perfumes  made according to the same recipes is entirely due to the different  spirits employed. Owing to the strong \"bouquet,\" as the French say, of  their spirit in comparison with ours, the continental perfumers claim a  superiority in the quality of their perfumes. Now, although we candidly  admit that _some_ odors are better when prepared with grape spirit than  with that from corn spirit, yet there are others which are undoubtedly  the best when prepared with spirit derived from the latter source. Musk,  ambergris, civet, violet, tubereuse, and jasmine, if we require to  retain their true aroma when in solution in alcohol, must be made with  the British spirit.    All the citrine odors, verveine, vulnerary waters, Eau de Cologne, Eau  de Portugal, Eau d'Arquebuzade, and lavender, can alone be brought to  perfection by using the French spirit in their manufacture. If extract  of jasmine, or extract of violet, &c., be made with the French or brandy  spirit, the true characteristic odor of the flower is lost to the  olfactory nerve--so completely does the oeanthic ether of the grape  spirit hide the flowery aroma of the otto of violet in solution with it.  This solves the paradox that English extract of violet and its  compounds, \"spring flowers,\" &c., is at all times in demand on the  Continent, although the very flowers with which we make it are grown  there.    On the contrary, if an English perfumer attempts to make Eau de  Portugal, &c., to bear any comparison as a fine odor to that made by  Lubin, of Paris, without using grape spirit, his attempts will prove a  failure. True, he makes Eau de Portugal even with English corn spirit,  but judges of the article--and they alone can stamp its merit--discover  instantly the same difference as the connoisseur finds out between  \"Patent British\" and foreign brandy.    Perhaps it may not be out of place here to observe that what is sold in  this country as British brandy is in truth grape spirit, that is,  foreign brandy very largely diluted with English spirit! By this scheme,  a real semblance to the foreign brandy flavor is maintained; the  difference in duty upon English and foreign spirit enables the makers of  the \"capsuled\" article to undersell those who vend the unsophisticated  Cognac.    Some chemists, not being very deep in the \"tricks of trade,\" have  thought that some flavoring, or that oeanthic ether, was used to  impart to British spirit the Cognac aroma. An article is even in the  market called \"Essence of Cognac,\" but which is nothing more than very  badly made butyric ether.    On the Continent a great deal of spirit is procured by the fermentation  of the molasses from beet-root; this, of course, finds its way into the  market, and is often mixed with the grape spirit; so, also, in England  we have spirit from potatoes, which is mixed in the corn spirit. These  adulterations, if we may so term it, modify the relative odors of the  primitive alcohols.    A JAPANESE PERFUME.
