On August 19, 1561, in a dense fog, and almost unexpected and unwelcomed,  Mary landed in Leith.  She had told the English ambassador to France that  she would constrain none of her subjects in religion, and hoped to be  unconstrained.  Her first act was to pardon some artisans, under censure  for a Robin Hood frolic: her motive, says Knox, was her knowledge that  they had acted \"in despite of religion.\"    The Lord James had stipulated that she might have her Mass in her private  chapel.  Her priest was mobbed by the godly; on the following Sunday Knox  denounced her Mass, and had his first interview with her later.  In vain  she spoke of her conscience; Knox said that it was unenlightened.  Lethington wished that he would \"deal more gently with a young princess  unpersuaded.\"  There were three or four later interviews, but Knox,  strengthened by a marriage with a girl of sixteen, daughter of Lord  Ochiltree, a Stewart, was proof against the queen's fascination.  In  spite of insults to her faith offered even at pageants of welcome, Mary  kept her temper, and, for long, cast in her lot with Lethington and her  brother, whose hope was to reconcile her with Elizabeth.    The Court was gay with riotous young French nobles, well mated with  Bothwell, who, though a Protestant, had sided with Mary of Guise during  the brawls of 1559.  He was now a man of twenty-seven, profligate,  reckless, a conqueror of hearts, a speaker of French, a ruffian, and well  educated.    In December it was arranged that the old bishops and other high clerics  should keep two-thirds of their revenues, the other third to be divided  between the preachers and the queen, \"between God and the devil,\" says  Knox.  Thenceforth there was a rift between the preachers and the  politicians, Lethington and Lord James (now Earl of Mar), on whom Mary  leaned.  The new Earl of Mar was furtively created Earl of Murray and  enjoyed the gift after the overthrow of Huntly.    In January 1562 Mary asked for an interview with Elizabeth.  Certainly  Lethington hoped that Elizabeth \"would be able to do much with Mary in  religion,\" meaning that, if Mary's claims to succeed Elizabeth were  granted, she might turn Anglican.  The request for a meeting, dallied  with but never granted, occupied diplomatists, while, at home, Arran  (March 31) accused Bothwell of training him into a plot to seize Mary's  person.  Arran probably told truth, but he now went mad; Bothwell was  imprisoned in the castle till his escape to England in August 1562.  Lethington, in June, was negotiating for Mary's interview with Elizabeth;  Knox bitterly opposed it; the preachers feared that the queen would turn  Anglican, and bishops might be let loose in Scotland.  The masques for  Mary's reception were actually being organised, when, in July, Elizabeth,  on the pretext of persecutions by the Guises in France, broke off the  negotiations.    The rest of the year was occupied by an affair of which the origins are  obscure.  Mary, with her brother and Lethington, made a progress into the  north, were affronted by and attacked Huntly, who died suddenly (October  28) at the fight of Corrichie; seized a son of his, who was executed  (November 2), and spoiled his castle which contained much of the property  of the Church of Aberdeen.  Mary's motives for destroying her chief  Catholic subject are not certainly known.  Her brother, Lord James, in  February made Earl of Mar, now received the lands and title of Earl of  Murray.  At some date in this year Knox preached against Mary because she  gave a dance.  He chose to connect her dance with some attack on the  Huguenots in France.  According to 'The Book of Discipline' he should  have remonstrated privately, as Mary told him.  The dates are  inextricable.  (See my 'John Knox and the Reformation,' pp. 215-218.)  Till the spring of 1565 the main business was the question of the queen's  marriage.  This continued to divide the ruling Protestant nobles from the  preachers.  Knox dreaded an alliance with Spain, a marriage with Don  Carlos.  But Elizabeth, to waste time, offered Mary the hand of Lord  Robert Dudley (Leicester), and, strange as it appears, Mary would  probably have accepted him, as late as 1565, for Elizabeth let it be  understood that to marry a Catholic prince would be the signal for war,  while Mary hoped that, if she accepted Elizabeth's favourite, Dudley, she  would be acknowledged as Elizabeth's heiress.  Mary was young, and showed  little knowledge of the nature of woman.    In 1563 came the affair of Chatelard, a French minor poet, a Huguenot  apparently, who, whether in mere fatuity or to discredit Mary, hid  himself under her bed at Holyrood, and again at Burntisland.  Mary had  listened to his rhymes, had danced with him, and smiled on him, but  Chatelard went too far.  He was decapitated in the market street of St  Andrews (Feb. 22, 1563).  It is clear, if we may trust Knox's account,  singularly unlike Brantome's, that Chatelard was a Huguenot.    About Easter priests were locked up in Ayrshire, the centre of  Presbyterian fanaticism, for celebrating Mass.  This was in accordance  with law, and to soften Knox the girl queen tried her personal influence.  He resisted \"the devil\"; Mary yielded, and allowed Archbishop Hamilton  and some fifty other clerics to be placed \"in prison courteous.\"  The  Estates, which met on May 27 for the first time since the queen landed,  were mollified, but were as far as ever from passing the Book of  Discipline.  They did pass a law condemning witches to death, a source of  unspeakable cruelties.  Knox and Murray now ceased to be on terms till  their common interests brought them together in 1565.    In June 1563 Elizabeth requested Mary to permit the return to Scotland of  Lennox (the traitor to the national cause and to Cardinal Beaton, and the  rival of the Hamiltons for the succession to the thrones), apparently for  the very purpose of entangling Mary in a marriage with Lennox's son  Darnley, and then thwarting it.  (It was not Mary who asked Elizabeth to  send Lennox.)  Knox's favourite candidate was Lord Robert Dudley: despite  his notorious character he sometimes favoured the English Puritans.  When  Holyrood had been invaded by a mob who, in Mary's absence in autumn 1563,  broke up the Catholic attendants on Mass (such attendance, in Mary's  absence, was illegal), and when both parties were summoned to trial, Knox  called together the godly.  The Council cleared him of the charge of  making an unlawful convocation (they might want to make one, any day,  themselves), and he was supported by the General Assembly.  Similar  conduct of the preachers thirty years later gave James VI. the  opportunity to triumph over the Kirk.    In June 1564 there was still discord between the Kirk and the Lords, and,  in a long argument with Lethington, Knox maintained the right of the  godly to imitate the slayings of idolaters by Phineas and Jehu: the  doctrine bore blood-red fruits among the later Covenanters.  Elizabeth,  in May 1564, in vain asked Mary to withdraw the permission (previously  asked for by her) to allow Lennox to visit Scotland and plead for the  restitution of his lands.  The objection to Lennox's appearance had come,  through Randolph, from Knox.  \"You may cause us to take the Lord  Darnley,\" wrote Kirkcaldy to Cecil, to stop Elizabeth's systems of  delays; and Sir James Melville, after going on a mission to Elizabeth,  warned Mary that she would never part with her minion, now Earl of  Leicester.    Lennox, in autumn 1564, arrived and was restored to his estates, while  Leicester and Cecil worked for the sending of his son Darnley to  Scotland.  Leicester had no desire to desert Elizabeth's Court and his  chance of touching her maiden heart.    The intrigues of Cecil, Leicester, and Elizabeth resemble rather a  chapter in a novel than a page in history.  Elizabeth notoriously hated  and, when she could, thwarted all marriages.  She desired that Mary  should never marry: a union with a Catholic prince she vetoed,  threatening war; and Leicester she offered merely \"to drive time.\"  But  Mary, evasively tempted by hints, later withdrawn, of her recognition as  Elizabeth's successor, was, till the end of March 1565, encouraged by  Randolph, the English ambassador at her Court, to remain in hope of  wedding Leicester.    Randolph himself was not in the secret of the English intrigue, which was  to slip Darnley at Mary.  He came (February 1565): Cecil and Leicester  had \"used earnest means\" to ensure his coming.  On March 17 Mary was  informed that she would never be recognised as Elizabeth's successor till  events should occur which never could occur.  On receiving this news Mary  wept; she also was indignant at the long and humiliating series of  Elizabeth's treacheries.  Her patience broke down; she turned to Darnley,  thereby, as the English intriguers designed, breaking up the concord of  her nobles.  To marry Darnley involved the feud of the Hamiltons, and the  return of Murray (whom Darnley had offended), of Chatelherault, Argyll,  and many other nobles to the party of Knox and the preachers.  Leicester  would have been welcome to Knox; Darnley was a Catholic, if anything, and  a weak passionate young fool.  Mary, in the clash of interests, was a  lost woman, as Randolph truly said, with sincere pity.  Her long  endurance, her attempts to \"run the English course,\" were wasted.    David Riccio, who came to Scotland as a musician in 1561, was now high in  her and in Darnley's favour.  Murray was accused of a conspiracy to seize  Darnley and Lennox; the godly began to organise an armed force (June  1565); Mary summoned from exile Bothwell, a man of the sword.  On July  29th she married Darnley, and on August 6th Murray, who had refused to  appear to answer the charges of treason brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#19)"],[1," stand here  printed in black and white.          THE ELDERBUSH    Once upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold. He had  gone out and got his feet wet; though nobody could imagine how it had  happened, for it was quite dry weather. So his mother undressed him, put  him to bed, and had the tea-pot brought in, to make him a good cup of  Elderflower tea. Just at that moment the merry old man came in who  lived up a-top of the house all alone; for he had neither wife nor  children--but he liked children very much, and knew so many fairy tales,  that it was quite delightful.    \"Now drink your tea,\" said the boy's mother; \"then, perhaps, you may  hear a fairy tale.\"    \"If I had but something new to tell,\" said the old man. \"But how did the  child get his feet wet?\"    \"That is the very thing that nobody can make out,\" said his mother.    \"Am I to hear a fairy tale?\" asked the little boy.    \"Yes, if you can tell me exactly--for I must know that first--how deep  the gutter is in the little street opposite, that you pass through in  going to school.\"    \"Just up to the middle of my boot,\" said the child; \"but then I must go  into the deep hole.\"    \"Ah, ah! That's where the wet feet came from,\" said the old man. \"I  ought now to tell you a story; but I don't know any more.\"    \"You can make one in a moment,\" said the little boy. \"My mother says  that all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can  find a story in everything.\"    \"Yes, but such tales and stories are good for nothing. The right sort  come of themselves; they tap at my forehead and say, 'Here we are.'\"    \"Won't there be a tap soon?\" asked the little boy. And his mother  laughed, put some Elder-flowers in the tea-pot, and poured boiling water  upon them.    \"Do tell me something! Pray do!\"    \"Yes, if a fairy tale would come of its own accord; but they are proud  and haughty, and come only when they choose. Stop!\" said he, all on a  sudden. \"I have it! Pay attention! There is one in the tea-pot!\"    And the little boy looked at the tea-pot. The cover rose more and more;  and the Elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white, and shot up long  branches. Out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides,  and grew larger and larger; it was a splendid Elderbush, a whole tree;  and it reached into the very bed, and pushed the curtains aside. How  it bloomed! And what an odour! In the middle of the bush sat a  friendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress. It was quite  green, like the leaves of the elder, and was trimmed with large white  Elder-flowers; so that at first one could not tell whether it was a  stuff, or a natural green and real flowers.    \"What's that woman's name?\" asked the little boy.    \"The Greeks and Romans,\" said the old man, \"called her a Dryad; but that  we do not understand. The people who live in the New Booths [*] have a much  better name for her; they call her 'old Granny'--and she it is to  whom you are to pay attention. Now listen, and look at the beautiful  Elderbush.         * A row of buildings for seamen in Copenhagen.    \"Just such another large blooming Elder Tree stands near the New Booths.  It grew there in the corner of a little miserable court-yard; and under  it sat, of an afternoon, in the most splendid sunshine, two old  people; an old, old seaman, and his old, old wife. They had  great-grand-children, and were soon to celebrate the fiftieth  anniversary of their marriage; but they could not exactly recollect the  date: and old Granny sat in the tree, and looked as pleased as now. 'I  know the date,' said she; but those below did not hear her, for they  were talking about old times.    \"'Yes, can't you remember when we were very little,' said the old  seaman, 'and ran and played about? It was the very same court-yard where  we now are, and we stuck slips in the ground, and made a garden.'    \"'I remember it well,' said the old woman; 'I remember it quite well. We  watered the slips, and one of them was an Elderbush. It took root, put  forth green shoots, and grew up to be the large tree under which we old  folks are now sitting.'    \"'To be sure,' said he. 'And there in the corner stood a waterpail,  where I used to swim my boats.'    \"'True; but first we went to school to learn somewhat,' said she; 'and  then we were confirmed. We both cried; but in the afternoon we went up  the Round Tower, and looked down on Copenhagen, and far, far away over  the water; then we went to Friedericksberg, where the King and the Queen  were sailing about in their splendid barges.'    \"'But I had a different sort of sailing to that, later; and that, too,  for many a year; a long way off, on great voyages.'    \"'Yes, many a time have I wept for your sake,' said she. 'I thought you  were dead and gone, and lying down in the deep waters. Many a night have  I got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had, sure  enough; but you never came. I remember so well one day, when the rain  was pouring down in torrents, the scavengers were before the house where  I was in service, and I had come up with the dust, and remained standing  at the door--it was dreadful weather--when just as I was there, the  postman came and gave me a letter. It was from you! What a tour that  letter had made! I opened it instantly and read: I laughed and wept.  I was so happy. In it I read that you were in warm lands where the  coffee-tree grows. What a blessed land that must be! You related so  much, and I saw it all the while the rain was pouring down, and I  standing there with the dust-box. At the same moment came someone who  embraced me.'    \"'Yes; but you gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle!'    \"'But I did not know it was you. You arrived as soon as your letter,  and you were so handsome--that you still are--and had a long yellow silk  handkerchief round your neck, and a bran new hat on; oh, you were so  dashing! Good heavens! What weather it was, and what a state the street  was in!'    \"'And then we married,' said he. 'Don't you remember? And then we  had our first little boy, and then Mary, and Nicholas, and Peter, and  Christian.'    \"'Yes, and how they all grew up to be honest people, and were beloved by  everybody.'    \"'And their children also have children,' said the old sailor; 'yes,  those are our grand-children, full of strength and vigor. It was,  methinks about this season that we had our wedding.'    \"'Yes, this very day is the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage,' said  old Granny, sticking her head between the two old people; who thought  it was their neighbor who nodded to them. They looked at each other and  held one another by the hand. Soon after came their children, and their  grand-children; for they knew well enough that it was the day of the  fiftieth anniversary, and had come with their gratulations that very  morning; but the old people had forgotten it, although they were able  to remember all that had happened many years ago. And the Elderbush sent  forth a strong odour in the sun, that was just about to set, and shone  right in the old people's faces. They both looked so rosy-cheeked; and  the youngest of the grandchildren danced around them, and called out  quite delighted, that there was to be something very splendid that  evening--they were all to have hot potatoes. And old Nanny nodded in the  bush, and shouted 'hurrah!' with the rest.\"    \"But that is no fairy tale,\" said the little boy, who was listening to  the story.    \"The thing is, you must understand it,\" said the narrator; \"let us ask  old Nanny.\"    \"That was no fairy tale, 'tis true,\" said old Nanny; \"but now it's  coming. The most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is  reality; were that not the case, you know, my magnificent Elderbush  could not have grown out of the tea-pot.\" And then she took the little  boy out of bed, laid him on her bosom, and the branches of the Elder  Tree, full of flowers, closed around her. They sat in an aerial  dwelling, and it flew with them through the air. Oh, it was wondrous  beautiful! Old Nanny had grown all of a sudden a young and pretty  maiden; but her robe was still the same green stuff with white flowers,  which she had worn before. On her bosom she had a real Elderflower,  and in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers; her eyes were so  large and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them; she kissed the  boy, and now they were of the same age and felt alike.    Hand in hand they went out of the bower, and they were standing in the  beautiful garden of their home. Near the green lawn papa's walking-stick  was tied, and for the little ones it seemed to be endowed with life; for  as soon as they got astride it, the round polished knob was turned into  a magnificent neighing head, a long black mane fluttered in the breeze,  and four slender yet strong legs shot out. The animal was strong and  handsome, and away they went at full gallop round the lawn.    \"Huzza! Now we are riding miles off,\" said the boy. \"We are riding away  to the castle where we were last year!\"    And on they rode round the grass-plot; and the little maiden, who, we  know, was no one else but old Nanny, kept on crying out, \"Now we are in  the country! Don't you see the farm-house yonder? And there is an Elder  Tree standing beside it; and the cock is scraping away the earth for the  hens, look, how he struts! And now we are close to the church. It lies  high upon the hill, between the large oak-trees, one of which is half  decayed. And now we are by the smithy, where the fire is blazing, and  where the half-naked men are banging with their hammers till the sparks  fly about. Away! away! To the beautiful country-seat!\"    And all that the little maiden, who sat behind on the stick, spoke of,  flew by in reality. The boy saw it all, and yet they were only going  round the grass-plot. Then they played in a side avenue, and marked out  a little garden on the"]]]
