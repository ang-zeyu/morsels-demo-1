[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#19)"],[1," warn  mortals that it designs that they should believe in contradictions, in  impossibilities, or in things of which they were incapable of forming  any positive idea.    The more mysteries a religion has, the more incredible objects it  presents to the mind, the better fitted it is to please the imagination  of men, who find in it a continual pasturage to feed upon. The more  obscure a religion is, the more it appears divine, that is to say, in  conformity to the nature of an invisible being, of whom we have no idea.    It is the peculiarity of ignorance to prefer the unknown, the concealed,  the fabulous, the wonderful, the incredible, even the terrible, to that  which is clear, simple, and true. Truth does not give to the imagination  such lively play as fiction, which each one may arrange as he pleases.  The vulgar ask nothing better than to listen to fables; priests and  legislators, by inventing religions and forging mysteries from them,  have served them to their taste. In this way they have attracted  enthusiasts, women, and the illiterate generally. Beings of this kind  resign easily to reasons which they are incapable of examining; the love  of the simple and the true is found but in the small number of those  whose imagination is regulated by study and by reflection. The  inhabitants of a village are never more pleased with their pastor than  when he mixes a good deal of Latin in his sermon. Ignorant men always  imagine that he who speaks to them of things which they do not  understand, is a very wise and learned man. This is the true principle  of the credulity of nations, and of the authority of those who pretend  to guide them.          CXIII.--CONTINUATION.    To speak to men to announce to them mysteries, is to give and retain, it  is to speak not to be understood. He who talks but by enigmas, either  seeks to amuse himself by the embarrassment which he causes, or finds it  to his advantage not to explain himself too clearly. Every secret  betrays suspicion, weakness, and fear. Princes and their ministers make  a mystery of their projects for fear that their enemies in penetrating  them would cause them to fail. Can a good God amuse Himself by the  embarrassment of His creatures? A God who enjoys a power which nothing  in the world can resist, can He apprehend that His intentions could be  thwarted? What interest would He have in putting upon us enigmas and  mysteries? We are told that man, by the weakness of his nature, is not  capable of comprehending the Divine economy which can be to him but a  tissue of mysteries; that God can not unveil secrets to him which are  beyond his reach. In this case, I reply, that man is not made to trouble  himself with Divine economy, that this economy can not interest him in  the least, that he has no need of mysteries which he can not understand;  finally, that a mysterious religion is not made for him, any more than  an eloquent discourse is made for a flock of sheep.          CXIV.--A UNIVERSAL GOD SHOULD HAVE REVEALED A UNIVERSAL RELIGION.    Divinity has revealed itself in the different parts of our globe in a  manner of such little uniformity, that in matters of religion men look  upon each other with hatred and disdain. The partisans of the different  sects see each other very ridiculous and foolish. The most respected  mysteries in one religion are laughable for another. God, having  revealed Himself to men, ought at least to speak in the same language to  all, and relieve their weak minds of the embarrassment of seeking what  can be the religion which truly emanated from Him, or what is the most  agreeable form of worship in His eyes.    A universal God ought to have revealed a universal religion. By what  fatality are so many different religions found on the earth? Which is  the true one amongst the great number of those of which each one  pretends to be the right one, to the exclusion of all the others? We  have every reason to believe that not one of them enjoys this advantage.  The divisions and the disputes about opinions are indubitable signs of  the uncertainty and of the obscurity of the principles which they  profess.          CXV.--THE PROOF THAT RELIGION IS NOT NECESSARY, IS THAT IT IS  UNINTELLIGIBLE.    If religion was necessary to all men, it ought to be intelligible to all  men. If this religion was the most important thing for them, the  goodness of God, it seems, ought to make it for them the clearest, the  most evident, and the best demonstrated of all things. Is it not  astonishing to see that this matter, so essential to the salvation of  mortals, is precisely the one which they understand the least, and about  which, during so many centuries, their doctors have disputed the most?  Never have priests, of even the same sect, come to an agreement among  themselves about the manner of understanding the wishes of a God who has  truly revealed Himself to them. The world which we inhabit can be  compared to a public place, in whose different parts several charlatans  are placed, each one straining himself to attract customers by  depreciating the remedies offered by his competitors. Each stand has its  purchasers, who are persuaded that their empiric alone possesses the  good remedies; notwithstanding the continual use which they make of  them, they do not perceive that they are no better, or that they are  just as sick as those who run after the charlatans of another stand.  Devotion is a disease of the imagination, contracted in infancy; the  devotee is a hypochondriac, who increases his disease by the use of  remedies. The wise man takes none of it; he follows a good regimen and  leaves the rest to nature.          CXVI.--ALL RELIGIONS ARE RIDICULED BY THOSE OF OPPOSITE THOUGH EQUALLY  INSANE BELIEF.    Nothing appears more ridiculous in the eyes of a sensible man than for  one denomination to criticize another whose creed is equally foolish. A  Christian thinks that the Koran, the Divine revelation announced by  Mohammed, is but a tissue of impertinent dreams and impostures injurious  to Divinity. The Mohammedan, on his side, treats the Christian as an  idolater and a dog; he sees but absurdities in his religion; he imagines  he has the right to conquer his country and force him, sword in hand, to  accept the faith of his Divine prophet; he believes especially that  nothing is more impious or more unreasonable than to worship a man or to  believe in the Trinity. The Protestant Christian, who without scruple  worships a man, and who believes firmly in the inconceivable mystery of  the Trinity, ridicules the Catholic Christian because the latter  believes in the mystery of the transubstantiation. He treats him as a  fool, as ungodly and idolatrous, because he kneels to worship the bread  in which he believes he sees the God of the universe. All the Christian  denominations agree in considering as folly the incarnation of the God  of the Indies, Vishnu. They contend that the only true incarnation is  that of Jesus, Son of the God of the universe and of the wife of a  carpenter. The theist, who calls himself a votary of natural religion,  is satisfied to acknowledge a God of whom he has no conception; indulges  himself in jesting upon other mysteries taught by all the religions of  the world.          CXVII.--OPINION OF A CELEBRATED THEOLOGIAN.    Did not a famous theologian recognize the absurdity of admitting the  existence of a God and arresting His course? \"To us,\" he said, \"who  believe through faith in a true God, an individual substance, there  ought to be no trouble in believing everything else. This first mystery,  which is no small matter of itself, once admitted, our reason can not  suffer violence in admitting all the rest. As for myself, it is no more  trouble to accept a million of things that I do not understand, than to  believe the first one.\"    Is there anything more contradictory, more impossible, or more  mysterious, than the creation of matter by an immaterial Being, who  Himself immutable, causes the continual changes that we see in the  world? Is there anything more incompatible with all the ideas of common  sense than to believe that a good, wise, equitable, and powerful Being  presides over nature and directs Himself the movements of a world which  is filled with follies, miseries, crimes, and disorders, which He could  have foreseen, and by a single word could have prevented or made to  disappear? Finally, as soon as we admit a Being so contradictory as the  theological God, what right have we to refuse to accept the most  improbable fables, the most astonishing miracles, the most profound  mysteries?          CXVIII.--THE DEIST'S GOD IS NO LESS CONTRADICTORY, NO LESS FANCIFUL, THAN  THE THEOLOGIAN'S GOD.    The theist exclaims, \"Be careful not to worship the ferocious and  strange God of theology; mine is much wiser and better; He is the Father  of men; He is the mildest of Sovereigns; it is He who fills the universe  with His benefactions!\" But I will tell him, do you not see that  everything in this world contradicts the good qualities which you  attribute to your God? In the numerous family of this mild Father I see  but unfortunate ones. Under the empire of this just Sovereign I see  crime victorious and virtue in distress. Among these benefactions, which  you boast of, and which your enthusiasm alone sees, I see a multitude of  evils of all kinds, upon which you obstinately close your eyes.        Compelled to acknowledge that your good God, in contradiction with  Himself, distributes with the same hand good and evil, you will find  yourself obliged, in order to justify Him, to send me, as the priests  would, to the other life. Invent, then, another God than the one of  theology, because your God is as contradictory as its God is. A good God  who does evil or who permits it to be done, a God full of equity and in  an empire where innocence is so often oppressed; a perfect God who  produces but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#19)"],[1,"donkeys were coming  towards him. One of them, the larger, moved forward quickly, then  stopped. Then a chill ran through him, his heart grew weak, his  breathing grew sharp, and the sweat suddenly started out all over  his face and body. That was no donkey standing there, with its huge  head now sunk almost to the ground, now lifted high, as it tried to  make out what manner of living creature it was crouching there by  the rock above!    Venning felt the hair stir on his head as the two animals stood  gazing at him, and then he knew. The one behind sank to the ground,  and with long steps began to creep round to the right. The moon  struck along its side, and showed the tawny hide and the whitish  under-parts of a lioness. The other, then, was a lion! With a sort  of gurgling in his throat he turned his eyes to it, and he saw it  trotting up straight for him, its shaggy mane giving to its head and  shoulders an enormous size. He felt spell-bound, incapable of moving  hand or foot. It was the silence of the ferocious beasts that  paralyzed him. Then the jackal howled behind him, and his blood  rushed through his veins. His tongue no longer clave to the roof of  his mouth, and when the great beast was within ten yards of him, he  let forth a terrific yell and jumped to his feet, with his rifle in  his hands.    The lion stopped suddenly in its charge with a low harsh grunt of  surprise. Never before in its hunting had it heard such a wild  uncanny noise. In one motion it stopped in its charge and swerved to  the right, and as it swerved the boy fired. The lion gave a mighty  bound, he heard it strike the ground with a heavy thud, and then it  seemed to disappear, though he knew it was near from the low  growling it set up.    From the camp there came a confused shouting, followed by the sound  of a man running.    Venning moistened his lips. \"Look out,\" he shouted, \"there is a lion  here.\"    \"Where are you?\"    \"Here, by this rock.\"    \"Stay there, and keep quite still.\"    The growling increased, and once more the same paralysis attacked  the boy so that he could scarcely breathe. Then some one stood at  his side, and the fear went from him at once.    \"He's over there, somewhere; but I can't see him.\"    \"I can. Get round the rock, my boy. He's lying flat with his head  between his paws, and it's a mercy you did not fire again and draw  his charge.\"    Venning moved round the rock, and Mr. Hume slowly followed. He  stopped awhile to listen to the incessant growling.    \"You've hit him, but not, I think, mortally; anyway, we'll leave  him, if he will leave us. Move on towards the camp quietly--don't  run.\"    \"No, sir,\" said Venning; but it required an effort not to make a  bolt for it when he saw the friendly gleam of the fire.    Mr. Hume followed slowly, with his head over his shoulder, towards  the place where the growling came from. When he reached the fire he  gave a great sigh of relief.    \"Thank God. Now tell us what happened, my boy;\" and he put his hand  on Venning's arm.    Venning started violently, for just then from the river there came a  harsh, growling call; and no sooner had it ceased than the ground  shook to a terrific roar.    \"The lion answers the lioness,\" said the chief, calmly.    \"Throw a little wood on the fire, Muata.  Now, my lad.\"    Venning told his story, and Compton listened with intense  excitement; but the hunter treated the whole thing calmly, with set  purpose. He had in his experience seen the effect of a terrible  shock, in the complete breakdown of the victim, and, personally, he  had known one man die from the shock to his system caused exactly by  the sudden and unexpected appearance of a lion at night. He kept  Venning's thoughts off the mental picture of the charging lion until  dawn, when all hands prepared for the hunt.    \"If you hit him hard he will be lying near, and I guess it will be a  different matter meeting him by daylight--eh, my lad?\"    Venning looked into the hunter's calm eyes, and felt strong. He went  straight to the rock against which he had crouched, and pointed to  the deep scars made in the hard ground by the sharp claws as the  lion had stopped his charge and wheeled.    Compton measured the distance from the rock to the claw-marks.    \"Fifteen feet! By Jove! it was a narrow squeak. I would have yelled  like fits.\"    \"I did yell.\"    Muata pointed to the ground.    \"Blood spoor, eh? You did hit him. Put the jackal on the track,  chief,\" said Mr. Hume.    The jackal took one sniff at the ground, stared sharply around, then  peered up into his master's face.    \"Search,\" said the chief, in his own tongue. \"Follow the great one,  O little friend. The trail is laid; the great one has sought out a  moist spot; he lies angry and sore in the shade. Search and find.\"    The jackal looked intently into the chiefs face, sniffed at the  ground, ran forward a few yards, stopped, sniffed again with lifted  mane at a spot where the grass was pressed down, threw up his head  with eyes half closed, then ran down towards the river, stopping on  the bank to look back.    \"That is where he joined his mate.  There is the spoor on the sand  going and returning. That is the round pad of the lion; just note  and compare it with the pads of the lioness over there. Just look,  and read the writing.\"    The two boys looked at the marks in the sand, and followed them down  to the moist ground on the edge of the water.    \"They entered the river side by side,\" they said.    \"That is plain; but the writing tells another story. See, this  footprint here is faint--very faint, eh? He did not rest his weight  on his left fore-foot.  Why, eh?\"    \"Because the bullet struck the left front leg,\" they both said.    \"They learn the signs, Muata. They will be hunters yet. Tell them if  the lion be hard hit, chief.\"    Muata waded into the river, which reached to his armpits at the  deepest, and bent over something on the further shore. They  undressed, and waded through to him.    \"Congela,\" he said, pointing to the bank. \"The great ones came out  here. The great, great one was not sore hurt, for he came right  through, using all his feet to swim.\"    \"It will be luck, then, if we find him,\" said the hunter.    \"Bad luck,\" muttered Compton to Venning, with a grin.    \"Forward, little friend!\" cried Muata. \"Search and find. It is a  great hunt this day. We follow the hunter of all things.\"    They slipped into their clothes and followed at a trot after the  jackal, which ran straight on, its bushy tail held low. It followed  the river down for a mile or so, then stopped, looking back at its  master.    Mr. Hume and the chief stood silently inspecting the hard ground,  then they walked on a few yards. The same thoughts seemed to come to  each, as the boys judged from their actions; for from the ground  their eyes ranged over the land, then were turned skywards. Muata  pointed a finger at a ringed crow flying with bent head.    \"They killed,\" said Mr. Hume.    \"Oh!! They killed.\"    \"You see,\" said the hunter to the two boys, \"the pair crouched here;  these circular marks in the sand were made by the swing of the  tails. They sighted game. One of them--the lioness, no doubt--worked  round to drive the game towards the lion.\"    \"It is a guess,\" said Compton. \"Perhaps the lion stopped because of  his hurt.\"    \"No; the bleeding has stopped. They not only sighted game, but the  lioness drove it from the river-bed towards the lion, and the lion  brought it down.\"    \"Oh, come,\" said Compton. \"How can you tell that?\"    \"From the spoor\"--laconically. \"He sprang twice--here, where he  alighted the first time; and the second spring landed him on to the  neck of an antelope powerful enough to struggle on into that thicket  of reeds. There the two of them pulled it down.\"    \"And there he is!\" shouted Venning.    He pointed to the right of the reeds, and there was a great  yellowish beast walking away at a slow walk, with its head sunk.    \"The lioness,\" said the hunter. \"Venning, keep by me, but a little  behind. Compton, when I whistle, fire into the reeds.\"    Compton nodded his head, and the two went off, while Muata sat down  as a spectator.    Mr. Hume walked steadily up to within fifty paces of the reeds on  the upper side, then whistled. Immediately Compton fired.    The lion was there. He signified his presence by a low growl, but he  did not move. Compton fired again, and this time the reeds shook,  and a great shaggy head appeared, with its yellow eyes fixed on the  boy. Mr. Hume made a slight noise, and the great head turned at once  in his direction. For a moment the lion exchanged glances, then with  a growl he turned into the reeds to reappear further on, going  slowly in the direction of the lioness.    \"It is your shot, Godfrey; take him just behind the shoulder.\"    Venning's heart was thumping against his ribs; but he steadied  himself for the shot, and fired. The lion sprang forward, snarling,  and faced about towards his enemies. Then up went his tail, and with  a savage growl he charged straight down to within about thirty feet,  when he stood for a moment, as is the way of the charging lion if  his enemy stands fast. The pause was enough; and before the huge  muscles of the flanks and backs could be set in motion to hurl the  great body forward, a bullet, crashing into his breast, laid him out  helpless in the throes of death.    \"Your first lion, Godfrey.\"    \"But you killed him,\" said Venning, pulling himself together with a  great effort; for he had been through a very severe ordeal.    \"The first hit counts. See here, your bullet last night struck him  above the elbow, just missing the bone, and your second shot hit him  low down in the ribs.\"    \"My word,\" said Compton, as he came up, his eyes blazing with  excitement, \"it was grand to see that charge. Yes, and to see how  you two stood. My heart was in my mouth.\"    \"It's a simple shot,\" said the hunter. \""]]]
