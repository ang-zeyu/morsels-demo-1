It is quite easy, of course, to think confusedly,  even whilst employing the clearest type of language; though in such  a case it is very hard to do so without being quickly brought to book.  On the other hand, it is not feasible to attain to a high degree of  clear thinking, when the only method of speech available is one that  tends towards wordlessness--that is to say, is relatively deficient  in verbal forms that preserve their identity in all contexts. Wordless  thinking is not in the strictest sense impossible; but its somewhat  restricted opportunities lie almost wholly on the farther side, as  it were, of a clean-cut vocabulary. For the very fact that the words  are crystallized into permanent shape invests them with a suggestion  of interrupted continuity, an overtone of un-utilized significance,  that of itself invites the mind to play with the corresponding fringe  of meaning attaching to the concepts that the words embody.    It would prove an endless task if I were to try here to illustrate  at all extensively the stickiness, as one might almost call it, of  primitive modes of speech. Person, number, case, tense, mood and  gender--all these, even in the relatively analytical phraseology of  the most cultured peoples, are apt to impress themselves on the very  body of the words of which they qualify the sense. But the meagre list  of determinations thus produced in an evolved type of language can  yield one no idea of the vast medley of complicated forms that serve  the same ends at the lower levels of human experience. Moreover, there  are many other shades of secondary and circumstantial meaning which  in advanced languages are invariably represented by distinct words,  so that when not wanted they can be left out, but in a more primitive  tongue are apt to run right through the very grammar of the sentence,  thus mixing themselves up inextricably with the really substantial  elements in the thought to be conveyed. For instance, in some American  languages, things are either animate or inanimate, and must be  distinguished accordingly by accompanying particles. Or, again, they  are classed by similar means as rational or irrational; women, by the  bye, being designated amongst the Chiquitos by the irrational sign.  Reverential particles, again, are used to distinguish what is high  or low in the tribal estimation; and we get in this connection such  oddities as the Tamil practice of restricting the privilege of having  a plural to high-caste names, such as those applied to gods and human  beings, as distinguished from the beasts, which are mere casteless  \"things.\" Or, once more, my transferable belongings, \"my-spear,\" or  \"my-canoe,\" undergo verbal modifications which are denied to  non-transferable possessions such as \"my-hand\"; \"my-child,\" be it  observed, falling within the latter class.    Most interesting of all are distinctions of person. These cannot but  bite into the forms of speech, since the native mind is taken up mostly  with the personal aspect of things, attaining to the conception of  a bloodless system of \"its\" with the greatest difficulty, if at all.  Even the third person, which is naturally the most colourless, because  excluded from a direct part of the conversational game, undergoes  multitudinous leavening in the light of conditions which the primitive  mind regards as highly important, whereas we should banish them from  our thoughts as so much irrelevant \"accident.\" Thus the Abipones in  the first place distinguished \"he-present,\" _eneha_, and  \"she-present,\" _anaha_, from \"he-absent\" and \"she-absent.\" But  presence by itself gave too little of the speaker's impression. So,  if \"he\" or \"she\" were sitting, it was necessary to say _hiniha_ and  _haneha_; if they were walking and in sight _ehaha_ and _ahaha_, but,  if walking and out of sight, _ekaha_ and _akaha_; if they were lying  down, _hiriha_ and _haraha_, and so on. Moreover, these were all  \"collective\" forms, implying that there were others involved as well.  If \"he\" or \"she\" were alone in the matter, an entirely different set  of words was needed, \"he-sitting (alone)\" becoming _ynitara_, and so  forth. The modest requirements of Fuegian intercourse have called more  than twenty such separate pronouns into being.    Without attempting to go thoroughly into the efforts of primitive  speech to curtail its interest in the personnel of its world by  gradually acquiring a stock of de-individualized words, let us glance  at another aspect of the subject, because it helps to bring out the  fundamental fact that language is a social product, a means of  intersubjective intercourse developed within a society that hands on  to a new generation the verbal experiments that are found to succeed  best. Payne shows reason for believing that the collective \"we\"  precedes \"I\" in the order of linguistic evolution. To begin with, in  America and elsewhere, \"we\" may be inclusive and mean \"all-of-us,\"  or selective, meaning \"some-of-us-only.\" Hence, we are told, a  missionary must be very careful, and, if he is preaching, must use  the inclusive \"we\" in saying \"we have sinned,\" lest the congregation  assume that only the clergy have sinned; whereas, in praying, he must  use the selective \"we,\" or God would be included in the list of sinners.  Similarly, \"I\" has a collective form amongst some American languages,  and this is ordinarily employed, whereas the corresponding selective  form is used only in special cases. Thus if the question be \"Who will  help?\" the Apache will reply \"I-amongst-others,\" \"I-for-one\"; but,  if he were recounting his own personal exploits, he says _sheedah_,  \"I-by-myself,\" to show that they were wholly his own. Here we seem  to have group-consciousness holding its own against individual  self-consciousness, as being for primitive folk on the whole the more  normal attitude of mind.    Another illustration of the sociality engrained in primitive speech  is to be found in the terms employed to denote relationship.  \"My-mother,\" to the child of nature, is something more than an ordinary  mother like yours. Thus, as we have already seen, there may be a special  particle applying to blood-relations as non-transferable possessions.  Or, again, one Australian language has special duals, \"we-two,\" one  to be used between relations generally, another between father and  child only. Or an American language supplies one kind of plural suffix  for blood-relations, another for the rest of human beings. These  linguistic concretions are enough to show how hard it is for primitive  thought to disjoin what is joined fast in the world of everyday  experience.    No wonder that it is usually found impracticable by the European  traveller who lacks an anthropological training to extract from  natives any coherent account of their system of relationships; for  his questions are apt to take the form of \"Can a man marry his deceased  wife's sister?\" or what not. Such generalities do not enter at all  into the highly concrete scheme of viewing the customs of his tribe  imposed on the savage alike by his manner of life and by the very forms  of his speech. The so-called \"genealogical method\" initiated by Dr.  Rivers, which the scientific explorer now invariably employs, rests  mainly on the use of a concrete type of procedure corresponding to  the mental habits of the simple folk under investigation. John, whom  you address here, can tell you exactly whether he may, or may not,  marry Mary Anne over there; also he can point out his mother, and tell  you her name, and the names of his brothers and sisters. You work round  the whole group--it very possibly contains no more than a few hundred  members at most--and interrogate them one and all about their  relationships to this and that individual whom you name. In course  of time you have a scheme which you can treat in your own analytic  way to your heart's content; whilst against your system of reckoning  affinity you can set up by way of contrast the native system; which  can always be obtained by asking each informant what relationship-terms  he would apply to the different members of his pedigree, and,  reciprocally, what terms they would each apply to him.           *       *       *       *       *    Before closing this altogether inadequate sketch of a vast and  intricate subject, I would say just one word about the expression of  ideas of number. It is quite a mistake to suppose that savages have  no sense of number, because the simple-minded European traveller,  compiling a short vocabulary in the usual way, can get no equivalent  for our numerals, say from 5 to 10. The fact is that the numerical  interest has taken a different turn, incorporating itself with other  interests of a more concrete kind in linguistic forms to which our  own type of language affords no key at all. Thus in the island of Kiwai,  at the mouth of the Fly River in New Guinea, the Cambridge Expedition  found a whole set of phrases in vogue, whereby the number of subjects  acting on the number of objects at a given moment could be concretely  specified. To indicate the action of two on many in the past, they  said _rudo_, in the present _durudo_; of many on many in the past _rumo_,  in the present _durumo_; of two on two in the past, _amarudo_, in the  present _amadurudo_; of many on two in the past _amarumo_; of many  on three in the past _ibidurumo_, of many on three in the present  _ibidurudo_; of three on two in the present, _amabidurumo_, of three  on two in the past, _amabirumo_, and so on. Meanwhile, words to serve  the purpose of pure counting are all the scarcer because hands and  feet supply in themselves an excellent means not only of calculating,  but likewise of communicating, a number.
