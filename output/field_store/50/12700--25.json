Reply Obj. 3: He who receives faith from God without charity, is  healed from unbelief, not entirely (because the sin of his previous  unbelief is not removed) but in part, namely, in the point of ceasing  from committing such and such a sin. Thus it happens frequently that  a man desists from one act of sin, through God causing him thus to  desist, without desisting from another act of sin, through the  instigation of his own malice. And in this way sometimes it is  granted by God to a man to believe, and yet he is not granted the  gift of charity: even so the gift of prophecy, or the like, is given  to some without charity.  _______________________    QUESTION 7    OF THE EFFECTS OF FAITH  (In Two Articles)    We must now consider the effects of faith: under which head there  are two points of inquiry:    (1) Whether fear is an effect of faith?    (2) Whether the heart is purified by faith?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 7, Art. 1]    Whether Fear Is an Effect of Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that fear is not an effect of faith. For  an effect does not precede its cause. Now fear precedes faith: for it  is written (Ecclus. 2:8): \"Ye that fear the Lord, believe in Him.\"  Therefore fear is not an effect of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, the same thing is not the cause of contraries. Now  fear and hope are contraries, as stated above (I-II, Q. 23, A. 2):  and faith begets hope, as a gloss observes on Matt. 1:2. Therefore  fear is not an effect of faith.    Obj. 3: Further, one contrary does not cause another. Now the object  of faith is a good, which is the First Truth, while the object of  fear is an evil, as stated above (I-II, Q. 42, A. 1). Again, acts  take their species from the object, according to what was stated  above (I-II, Q. 18, A. 2). Therefore faith is not a cause of fear.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (James 2:19): \"The devils . . .  believe and tremble.\"    _I answer that,_ Fear is a movement of the appetitive power, as  stated above (I-II, Q. 41, A. 1). Now the principle of all appetitive  movements is the good or evil apprehended: and consequently the  principle of fear and of every appetitive movement must be an  apprehension. Again, through faith there arises in us an apprehension  of certain penal evils, which are inflicted in accordance with the  Divine judgment. In this way, then, faith is a cause of the fear  whereby one dreads to be punished by God; and this is servile fear.    It is also the cause of filial fear, whereby one dreads to be  separated from God, or whereby one shrinks from equalling oneself to  Him, and holds Him in reverence, inasmuch as faith makes us appreciate  God as an unfathomable and supreme good, separation from which is the  greatest evil, and to which it is wicked to wish to be equalled. Of  the first fear, viz. servile fear, lifeless faith is the cause, while  living faith is the cause of the second, viz. filial fear, because it  makes man adhere to God and to be subject to Him by charity.    Reply Obj. 1: Fear of God cannot altogether precede faith, because if  we knew nothing at all about Him, with regard to rewards and  punishments, concerning which faith teaches us, we should nowise fear  Him. If, however, faith be presupposed in reference to certain  articles of faith, for example the Divine excellence, then  reverential fear follows, the result of which is that man submits his  intellect to God, so as to believe in all the Divine promises. Hence  the text quoted continues: \"And your reward shall not be made void.\"    Reply Obj. 2: The same thing in respect of contraries can be the  cause of contraries, but not under the same aspect. Now faith begets  hope, in so far as it enables us to appreciate the prize which God  awards to the just, while it is the cause of fear, in so far as it  makes us appreciate the punishments which He intends to inflict on  sinners.    Reply Obj. 3: The primary and formal object of faith is the good  which is the First Truth; but the material object of faith includes  also certain evils; for instance, that it is an evil either not to  submit to God, or to be separated from Him, and that sinners will  suffer penal evils from God: in this way faith can be the cause of  fear.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 7, Art. 2]    Whether Faith Has the Effect of Purifying the Heart?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith does not purify the heart. For  purity of the heart pertains chiefly to the affections, whereas faith  is in the intellect. Therefore faith has not the effect of purifying  the heart.    Obj. 2: Further, that which purifies the heart is incompatible with  impurity. But faith is compatible with the impurity of sin, as may be  seen in those who have lifeless faith. Therefore faith does not  purify the heart.    Obj. 3: Further, if faith were to purify the human heart in any way,  it would chiefly purify the intellect of man. Now it does not purify  the intellect from obscurity, since it is a veiled knowledge.  Therefore faith nowise purifies the heart.    _On the contrary,_ Peter said (Acts 15:9): \"Purifying their hearts by  faith.\"    _I answer that,_ A thing is impure through being mixed with baser  things: for silver is not called impure, when mixed with gold, which  betters it, but when mixed with lead or tin. Now it is evident that  the rational creature is more excellent than all transient and  corporeal creatures; so that it becomes impure through subjecting  itself to transient things by loving them. From this impurity the  rational creature is purified by means of a contrary movement,  namely, by tending to that which is above it, viz. God. The first  beginning of this movement is faith: since \"he that cometh to God  must believe that He is,\" according to Heb. 11:6. Hence the first  beginning of the heart's purifying is faith; and if this be perfected  through being quickened by charity, the heart will be perfectly  purified thereby.    Reply Obj. 1: Things that are in the intellect are the principles of  those which are in the appetite, in so far as the apprehended good  moves the appetite.    Reply Obj. 2: Even lifeless faith excludes a certain impurity which  is contrary to it, viz. that of error, and which consists in the  human intellect, adhering inordinately to things below itself,  through wishing to measure Divine things by the rule of sensible  objects. But when it is quickened by charity, then it is incompatible  with any kind of impurity, because \"charity covereth all sins\" (Prov.  10:12).    Reply Obj. 3: The obscurity of faith does not pertain to the impurity  of sin, but rather to the natural defect of the human intellect,  according to the present state of life.  _______________________    QUESTION 8    OF THE GIFT OF UNDERSTANDING  (In Eight Articles)    We must now consider the gifts of understanding and knowledge, which  respond to the virtue of faith. With regard to the gift of  understanding there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether understanding is a gift of the Holy Ghost?    (2) Whether it can be together with faith in the same person?    (3) Whether the understanding which is a gift of the Holy Ghost, is  only speculative, or practical also?    (4) Whether all who are in a state of grace have the gift of  understanding?    (5) Whether this gift is to be found in those who are without grace?    (6) Of the relationship of the gift of understanding to the other  gifts.    (7) Which of the beatitudes corresponds to this gift?    (8) Which of the fruits?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 8, Art. 1]    Whether Understanding Is a Gift of the Holy Ghost?    Objection 1: It would seem that understanding is not a gift of the  Holy Ghost. For the gifts of grace are distinct from the gifts of  nature, since they are given in addition to the latter. Now  understanding is a natural habit of the soul, whereby self-evident  principles are known, as stated in _Ethic._ vi, 6. Therefore it should  not be reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost.    Obj. 2: Further, the Divine gifts are shared by creatures according  to their capacity and mode, as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). Now  the mode of human nature is to know the truth, not simply (which is a  sign of understanding), but discursively (which is a sign of reason),  as Dionysius explains (Div. Nom. vii). Therefore the Divine knowledge  which is bestowed on man, should be called a gift of reason rather  than a gift of understanding.    Obj. 3: Further, in the powers of the soul the understanding is  condivided with the will (De Anima iii, 9, 10). Now no gift of the Holy  Ghost is called after the will. Therefore no gift of the Holy Ghost  should receive the name of understanding.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Isa. 11:2): \"The Spirit of the Lord  shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom of understanding.\"    _I answer that,_ Understanding implies an intimate knowledge, for  \"intelligere\" [to understand] is the same as \"intus legere\" [to read  inwardly]. This is clear to anyone who considers the difference  between intellect and sense, because sensitive knowledge is concerned  with external sensible qualities, whereas intellective knowledge  penetrates into the very essence of a thing, because the object of the  intellect is \"what a thing is,\" as stated in _De Anima_ iii, 6.    Now there are many kinds of things that are hidden within, to find  which human knowledge has to penetrate within so to speak. Thus, under  the accidents lies hidden the nature of the substantial reality, under  words lies hidden their meaning; under likenesses and figures the  truth they denote lies hidden (because the intelligible world is  enclosed within as compared with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#19)"],[1,"said about the great rivers--the arteries of  Chinese commerce, even more than the caravan routes,--above all, the  Yang-Tse-Kiang, \"the greatest stream in the world, like an arm of the  sea, flowing above one hundred days' journey from its source into the  ocean, and into which flow countless others, making it so great that  incredible quantities of merchandise are brought by this river. It  flows,\" exclaims Marco, \"through sixteen provinces, past the quays of  two hundred cities, at one of which I saw at one time five thousand  vessels, and there are other marts that have more.\"    The breadth and depth and length and merchandise of the Pulisangan and  the Caramaran are only less than the Kiang's; from the point where Marco  crossed the second of these, there was not another bridge till it  reached the ocean, hundreds of miles away, \"by reason of its exceeding  greatness.\"    Lastly Pekin, the capital of the Empire, with Quinsai and the other  provincial capitals of Mangi and Cathay, call out the unbounded  admiration of the Polos as of every other Western traveller, from the  Moslem Ibn Batuta to the Christian friars of the fourteenth century.    Pekin, two days' journey from the ocean, the residence of the Court in  December, January, and February, in the extreme north-east of Cathay,  had been lately rebuilt in a \"central square of twenty-four miles in  compass, and twelve suburbs, three or four miles long, adjoining each of  the twelve gates,\" where merchants and strangers lived, each nation with  separate \"burses\" or store-houses, where they lodged. From this centre  to the land of Gog and Magog and the champaign-land of Bargu, the Great  Khan travelled every year in midsummer for the fresh air of the plateau  country of central Asia, as well as for a better view of the great  Russian and Bactrian sub-kingdoms of his House. The six months of spring  and autumn were spent in slow progresses through central and southern  China to Thibet on one side, and to Tonquin on the other. But greater  even than Pekin, Quinsai, or Kansay, the City of Heaven, in southern  China, though no longer the capital even of a separate Kingdom of Mangi,  was the crowning work of Chinese civilisation. It surpassed the other  cities of Kublai, as much as these overshadowed the Rome or Venice of  the thirteenth century.    \"In the world there is not its like, for by common report it is one  hundred miles in circuit, with a lake on one side and a river on the  other, divided in many channels and upon these and the canals adjoining  twelve thousand bridges of stone; there are ten market places, each half  a mile square; great store-houses of stone, where the Indian merchants  lay by their goods; palaces and gardens on both sides of the main  street, which, like all the highways in Mangi, is paved with stone on  each side, and in the midst full of gravel, with passages for the water,  which keeps it always clean.\" Salt, silk, fruit, precious stones, and  cloth of gold are the chief commodities; the paper money of the Great  Khan is used everywhere; all the people, except a few Nestorians and  Moslems, are \"idolaters, so luxurious and so happy that a man would  think himself in Paradise.\"    It was only in recent years that Kublai, or his general, Baian, had  captured Quinsai and driven out the King of Mangi with his seraglio and  his friends. The exile till then had only thought of pleasure, of wine,  women, and song, the \"sweet meat which cost him the sour sauce ye have  heard,\" on the approach of danger, had fled on board the ships he had  prepared to \"certain impregnable isles in the ocean,\" and if these  impregnable islands may be identified with Zipangu or Japan, the  conquerors pursued him even here. There is nothing more interesting in  Polo's book than his story of the Mongol failure in the Eastern islands,  fifteen hundred miles from the coast of Mangi, now first discovered to  Christian knowledge.    This country of Japan, \"very great, the people white, of gentle manners,  idolaters in religion, under a King of their own,\" was attacked by  Kublai's fleet in 1264 for the gold they had, and had in such plenty  that \"the King's house, windows, and floors were covered with it, as  churches here with lead, as was reported by merchants--but these were  few and the King allowed no exportation of the gold.\"    The expedition was as disastrous a failure as the old Athenian attack  upon Sicily, and was not repeated, although fleets were sent by the  Great Khan after this into the Southern Seas, which were supposed to  have made a discovery of Papua, if not of the Australian Continent. \"In  this Sea of China, over against Mangi,\" Marco reported, from hearsay \"of  mariners and expert pilots, are 7440 islands, most of them inhabited,  whereon grows no tree that yields not a pleasant smell--spices,  lignum-aloes, and pepper, black and white.\" The ships of Zaitum (the  great Chinese mart for Indian trade) knew this sea and its islands, \"for  they go every winter and return every summer, taking a year on the  voyage, and all this though it is far from India and not subject to the  Great Khan.\"    But not only did Polo in these sections of his Guide Book or Memories of  Travel, record the main features of a coast and ocean scarcely guessed  at by Europeans, and flatly denied by Ptolemy and the main traditional  school of Western geography. In his service under Kublai, and in his  return by sea to Aden and Suez, he opened up the eight provinces of  Thibet, the whole of south-east Asia from Canton to Bengal, and the  great archipelago of further India.    Four days' journey beyond the Yang-Tse-Kiang, Marco entered \"the wide  country of Thibet, vanquished and wasted by the Khan for the space of  twenty days' journey, and become a wilderness wanting inhabitants, where  wild beasts are excessively increased.\" Here he tells us of the Yak-oxen  and great Thibetan dogs as great as asses, of the musk deer, and spices,  \"and salt lakes having beds of pearls,\" and of the cruel and bestial  idolatry and social customs of the people.    Still farther to the south-west, Commissioner Polo came to the Cinnamon  river, called Brius, on the borders of the province of Caindu, to the  porcelain-making districts of Carazan, governed by Kublai's son, and so  to Bengal, \"which borders upon India,\" and where Marco laughs at the  tattoo customs of \"flesh embroidery for the dyeing of fools' skins.\"    Thence back to China, the richest and most famous country of all the  East, where was \"peace so absolute that shops could be left open full of  wares all night and travellers and strangers could walk day and night  through every part, untouched and fearing none.\"    But the Polos wearied even of the Court favours and their celestial  home; they longed to come back to earth, to Frankland and Christendom,  where life was so rough, and poor, and struggling, but for whose sake  they had come so far and braved so much. But the Khan was hurt at the  least hint of their wishes, and it was only a fortunate chance that  restored them to Europe. Twenty years after their outward start, they  were dismissed for a time and under solemn promise of return, as the  guides of an embassy in charge of a Mongol bride for a Persian Khan,  living at Tabrez and related to Kublai himself. So, in 1292, they  embarked for India at Zaitum, \"one of the fairest ports in the world,  where is so much pepper that what comes by Alexandria to the West is  little to it, and, as it were, one of a hundred.\" Then striking across  the Gulf of Cheinan, for fifteen hundred miles, and passing \"infinite  islands, with gold and much trade,\"--a gulf \"seeming in all like another  world\"--they reached Ziambar and, after another run of the same  distance, Java, then supposed by mariners to be the greatest island in  the world, \"above three thousand miles round and under a king who pays  tribute to none, the Khan himself not offering to subject it, because of  the length and danger of the voyage.\"    One hundred miles south-east the fleet touched at Java the Less \"in  compass about two thousand miles, with abundance of treasure and spices,  ebony, and brazil, and so far to the south that the North Star cannot be  seen, and none of the stars of the Great Bear.\" Here they were in great  fear of \"those brutish man eaters,\" with whom they traded for victuals  and camphire and spices and precious stones, being forced to stay for  five months by stress of weather--till they got away into the Bay of  Bengal, the extreme point of European knowledge until this time, \"where  there are savages living in the deep sea islands with dogs' heads and  teeth, as I was told, all naked, both men and women, and living the life  of beasts (Andamans).\"[26]    [Footnote 26: Probably the Andamans.]    Sailing hence a thousand miles to the west, adds Marco, is Ceylon, \"the  finest island in the world, 2400 miles in circuit, and once 3600, as is  seen in old maps, but the north winds have made great part of it sea.\"    Again west for sixty miles, to Malabar, \"which is firm continent in  India the Greater,\" and where the Polos re-entered as it were the  horizon of Western knowledge, at the shrine of St. Thomas, the Apostle  of India.    Here we must leave the Venetians, with only a bare mention of their  homeward route from Malabar by Murfili and the Valley of Diamonds, by  Camari, where they had a glimpse of the Pole-Star once more, and by  Guzerat and Cambay to Socotra, where Marco, in his stay, heard and wrote  down the first news ever brought to Europe of the \"great isle Magaster,\"  or Madagascar, and of Zensibar or Zanzibar.[27]    [Footnote 27: This new knowledge had been really gained from the gradual  spread of the Arab settlements down the south-east coast of Africa,  during four centuries, from Guardafui, the Cape of spices, to the  Channel of Mozambique.]    Of Polo's account of Hindu customs,--self-immolation and especially"]]]
