[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#19)"],[1,"is evident from       the words of St. Augustine (_Encheiridion_, c. 112): _Paenas       damnatorum certis temporum intervallis existiment, si hoc eis placet,       aliquatenus mitigari, dummodo intelligatur in eis manere ira Dei, hoc       est ipsa damnatio._ \"Let men believe, if it so please them, that at       certain intervals the pains of the damned are somewhat alleviated,       provided that it be understood that the wrath of God, that is       damnation itself, abides upon them.\"    140     It is somewhat startling to find Prudentius speaking of the Holy       Eucharist in terms which would recall to his contemporary readers       Virgilian phraseology and the honeyed cake (_liba_) used in pagan       sacrifice. It must be remembered, however, that in the early days of       the Church paganism and Christianity flourished side by side for a       considerable period; and we find various pagan practices allowed       to continue, where they were innocent. Thus the bride-cake and the       bridal-veil are of heathen origin; the mirth of the Saturnalia       survives, in a modified form, in some of the rejoicings of Christmas;       and the flowers, which had filled the pagan temples during the       Floralia, were employed to adorn God's House at the Easter festival.    141     The brilliant illumination of churches on Easter Eve is very       ancient. According to Eusebius, Constantine \"turned the mystical       vigil into the light of day by means of lamps suspended in every       part, setting up also great waxen tapers, as large as columns,       throughout the city.\" Gregory of Nyssa also speaks of \"the cloud       of fire mingling with the rays of the rising sun, and making the eve       and the festival one continuous day without interval of darkness.\"    153     Cf. _Paradise Lost_, iii. 51:--              \"So much the rather thou, Celestial Light,            Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers            Irradiate.\"                                       VI         The last seven stanzas of this hymn are used in the Moz. Brev. at       Compline on Passion Sunday, and daily until Maundy Thursday.    56     Cf. Job. vii. 14: \"Then Thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest       me through visions.\"    95     In the translation of this stanza the explanation of Nebrissensis       is adopted, an early editor of Prudentius (1512) and one of the       leaders of the Renaissance in Spain. He considers that \"the few of       the impious who are condemned to eternal death\" are the incurable       sinners, _immedicabiles_. Others attempt to reconcile these words       with the general belief of the early Church by maintaining that       _non pii_ is not equivalent to _impii_, but rather refers to the       class that is neither decidedly good nor definitely bad, and that       the mercy of God is extended to the majority of these. A third view       is that the poet is speaking relatively, and means that few are       condemned in proportion to the number that deserve condemnation.       In whatever way the words are explained, it is interesting to find       an advocate of \"the larger hope\" in the fourth century.    105     Cf. Rev. xvii. 8: \"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not;       and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition.\"    109     Cf. 2 Thess. ii. 4: \"The son of perdition, who opposeth and       exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped;       so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that       he is God.\"    127     The phrase _rorem subisse sacrum_ would suggest baptism by       sprinkling, except that Prudentius uses the word loosely elsewhere.       Immersion was undoubtedly the general practice of the early Church,       \"clinical\" baptism being allowed only in cases of necessity.    128     The anointing with oil showed that the catechumen was enrolled       among the spiritual priesthood, and with the unction was joined the       sign of the Cross on the forehead.                                        VII    1     This entire hymn is used in the Moz. Brev., divided into fifteen       portions for use during Lent.    27     The word _sacerdos_ here, as in ix. 4, is used in the sense of       \"prophet\"; but in both passages there is some idea of the exercise       of priestly functions. Elijah may be called \"priest\" from his having       offered sacrifice on Mount Carmel, and David from his wearing the       priestly ephod as he danced before the Ark.    69     The old editors discuss these lines with much gravity, and mostly       come to the conclusion that \"locusts\" were \"a kind of bird, of       the length of a finger, with quick, short flight\"; while the \"wild       honey\" was not actual honey at all, but \"the tender leaves of       certain trees, which, when crushed by the fingers, had the pleasant       savour of honey.\"    76     A gloss on one of the Vat. MSS. adds: \"This is not authorised; for       John merely baptized with water, and not in the name of the Father,       Son and Holy Ghost; therefore his baptism was of no avail, save that       it prepared the way for Christ to baptize.\" Many of the Fathers,       however, while expressly affirming that John's baptism differed       from that of Christ, allowed that the stains of sin were washed       away by the former. St. Chrysostom draws this distinction: \"There       was in John's baptism pardon, but not without repentance; remission       of sins, but only attained by grief.\"    100     The story of Jonah, as a type of the Resurrection, is one of the       most frequent subjects of the frescoes of the Catacombs. In one very       ancient picture, a man in a small boat is depicted in the act of       placing the prophet in the very jaws of the whale.    115     Two stanzas are omitted in the text, which depict the sufferings       of Jonah with a wealth of detail not in accordance with modern       taste. For the sake of giving a complete text, we append them here:--              \"_Transmissa raptim praeda cassos dentium            eludit ictus incruentam transvolans            inpune linguam, ne retentam mordicus            offam molares dissecarent uvidi,            os omne transit et palatum praeterit._              _Ternis dierum ac noctium processibus            mansit ferino devoratus gutture,            errabat illic per latebras viscerum,            ventris recessus circumibat tortiles            anhelus extis intus aestuantibus._\"    194     Prudentius appears to have believed that the mystery of the       Incarnation was concealed from Satan, and that the Temptation       was an endeavour to ascertain whether Jesus was the Son of God       or no. Cf. Milton, _Par. Reg._ i.:--              \"Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems            In all his lineaments, though in his face            The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.\"                                        VIII    9     The day of twelve hours appears to have been adopted by the       Romans about B.C. 291. Ambrose (_de virginibus_, iii. 4), commenting       on Ps. cxix. and the words \"Seven times a day do I praise thee,\"       declares that prayers are to be offered up with thanksgiving when       we rise from sleep, when we go forth, when we prepare to take food,       when we have taken it, at the hour of incense, and lastly, when we       retire to rest. He probably alludes to private prayer. The stanza       here indicates that the second hour after midday has arrived, when       the fasting ended and the midday meal was taken.    14     The word _festum_, as in vii. 4, indicates a special fast day.       Until the sixth century, fasting was simply a penitential discipline       and was not used as a particular mode of penance. In the fourth       century it was a fairly common practice as a preparation for Holy       Communion. Fasting before Baptism was a much earlier practice.       The stated fasts of the Western Church were (1) _annual_, that       is, ante-paschal or Lent; (2) _monthly_, or the fasts of the four       seasons in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th months; (3) _weekly_, on       Wednesday and Friday. There was also the fast of the Rogations and       the Vigils or Eves of holy days. It is doubtful whether all these       were in vogue as early as Prudentius.    33     This passage on the Shepherd reminds us of one of the most common       pictorial representations of the Catacombs. Christian art owed       something to paganism in this matter; ancient sculptures represent       the god Pan with a goat thrown across his shoulders and a Pan's       pipe in his hand; while the poets Calpurnius and Tibullus both       refer to the custom of carrying a stray or neglected lamb on the       shoulders of the shepherd. Going further back, the figure is common       in the O. T. to express God's care over His people. Our Lord       therefore used for His own purpose and transfigured with new       meaning a familiar figure. The gradual transition from paganism       to Christianity is curiously illustrated by the fact that in several       of the Catacomb bas-reliefs and paintings the Good Shepherd holds in       His outstretched hand a Pan's pipe. See Maitland's _Church in the       Catacombs_, p. 315, for a woodcut of the Good Shepherd with a lamb       over His shoulders, two sheep at His feet, a palm tree (or poplar)       on either side, and a Pan's pipe in His right hand; and also the       frontispiece for a reproduction from the Cemetery of St. Peter and       St. Marcellinus.                                       IX    1     This hymn, which first introduced into sacred song the trochaic       metre familiar in Greek Tragedy and the Latin adaptations of it,       supplies the Moz. Brev. with some stanzas for use during Holy Week.       The lines selected are 22-24, 1-21.    11     The use of the symbol _O_, (pronounced here as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#19)"],[1,"eed, if one could give a more definite  content to the terms \"masculine and feminine,\" one might advance the  opinion that _the libido is regularly and lawfully of a masculine  nature, whether in the man or in the woman; and if we consider its  object, this may be either the man or the woman_.[4]    Since becoming acquainted with the aspect of bisexuality I hold this  factor as here decisive, and I believe that without taking into account  the factor of bisexuality it will hardly be possible to understand the  actually observed sexual manifestations in man and woman.    *The Leading Zones in Man and Woman.*--Further than this I can only add  the following. The chief erogenous zone in the female child is the  clitoris, which is homologous to the male penis. All I have been able to  discover concerning masturbation in little girls concerned the clitoris  and not those other external genitals which are so important for the  later sexual functions. With few exceptions I myself doubt whether the  female child can be seduced to anything but clitoris masturbation. The  frequent spontaneous discharges of sexual excitement in little girls  manifest themselves in a twitching of the clitoris, and its frequent  erections enable the girl to understand correctly even without any  instruction the sexual manifestations of the other sex; they simply  transfer to the boys the sensations of their own sexual processes.    If one wishes to understand how the little girl becomes a woman, he must  follow up the further destinies of this clitoris excitation. Puberty,  which brings to the boy a great advance of libido, distinguishes itself  in the girl by a new wave of repression which especially concerns the  clitoris sexuality. It is a part of the male sexual life that sinks into  repression. The reenforcement of the sexual inhibitions produced in the  woman by the repression of puberty causes a stimulus in the libido of  the man and forces it to increase its capacity; with the height of the  libido there is a rise in the overestimation of the sexual, which can be  present in its full force only when the woman refuses and denies her  sexuality. If the sexual act is finally submitted to and the clitoris  becomes excited its role is then to conduct the excitement to the  adjacent female parts, and in this it acts like a chip of pine wood  which is utilized to set fire to the harder wood. It often takes some  time for this transference to be accomplished; during which the young  wife remains anesthetic. This anesthesia may become permanent if the  clitoris zone refuses to give up its excitability; a condition brought  on by abundant activities in infantile life. It is known that anesthesia  in women is often only apparent and local. They are anesthetic at the  vaginal entrance but not at all unexcitable through the clitoris or even  through other zones. Besides these erogenous causes of anesthesia there  are also psychic causes likewise determined by the repression.    If the transference of the erogenous excitability from the clitoris to  the vagina has succeeded, the woman has thus changed her leading zone  for the future sexual activity; the man on the other hand retains his  from childhood. The main determinants for the woman's preference for the  neuroses, especially for hysteria, lie in this change of the leading  zone as well as in the repression of puberty. These determinants are  therefore most intimately connected with the nature of femininity.      THE OBJECT-FINDING    While the primacy of the genital zones is being established through the  processes of puberty, and the erected penis in the man imperiously  points towards the new sexual aim, _i.e._, towards the penetration of a  cavity which excites the genital zone, the object-finding, for which  also preparations have been made since early childhood, becomes  consummated on the psychic side. While the very incipient sexual  gratifications are still connected with the taking of nourishment, the  sexual impulse has a sexual object outside its own body in his mother's  breast. This object it loses later, perhaps at the very time when it  becomes possible for the child to form a general picture of the person  to whom the organ granting him the gratification belongs. The sexual  impulse later regularly becomes autoerotic, and only after overcoming  the latency period is there a resumption of the original relation. It is  not without good reason that the suckling of the child at its mother's  breast has become a model for every amour. The object-finding is really  a re-finding.[5]    *The Sexual Object of the Nursing Period.*--However, even after the  separation of the sexual activity from the taking of nourishment, there  still remains from this first and most important of all sexual relations  an important share, which prepares the object selection and assists in  reestablishing the lost happiness. Throughout the latency period the  child learns to love other persons who assist it in its helplessness and  gratify its wants; all this follows the model and is a continuation of  the child's infantile relations to his wet nurse. One may perhaps  hesitate to identify the tender feelings and esteem of the child for his  foster-parents with sexual love; I believe, however, that a more  thorough psychological investigation will establish this identity beyond  any doubt. The intercourse between the child and its foster-parents is  for the former an inexhaustible source of sexual excitation and  gratification of erogenous zones, especially since the parents--or as a  rule the mother--supplies the child with feelings which originate from  her own sexual life; she pats it, kisses it, and rocks it, plainly  taking it as a substitute for a full-valued sexual object.[6] The mother  would probably be terrified if it were explained to her that all her  tenderness awakens the sexual impulse of her child and prepares its  future intensity. She considers her actions as asexually \"pure\" love,  for she carefully avoids causing more irritation to the genitals of the  child than is indispensable in caring for the body. But as we know the  sexual impulse is not awakened by the excitation of genital zones alone.  What we call tenderness will some day surely manifest its influence on  the genital zones also. If the mother better understood the high  significance of the sexual impulse for the whole psychic life and for  all ethical and psychic activities, the enlightenment would spare her  all reproaches. By teaching the child to love she only fulfills her  function; for the child should become a fit man with energetic sexual  needs, and accomplish in life all that the impulse urges the man to do.  Of course, too much parental tenderness becomes harmful because it  accelerates the sexual maturity, and also because it \"spoils\" the child  and makes it unfit to temporarily renounce love or be satisfied with a  smaller amount of love in later life. One of the surest premonitions of  later nervousness is the fact that the child shows itself insatiable in  its demands for parental tenderness; on the other hand, neuropathic  parents, who usually display a boundless tenderness, often with their  caressing awaken in the child a disposition for neurotic diseases. This  example at least shows that neuropathic parents have nearer ways than  inheritance by which they can transfer their disturbances to their  children.    *Infantile Fear.*--The children themselves behave from their early  childhood as if their attachment to their foster-parents were of the  nature of sexual love. The fear of children is originally nothing but an  expression for the fact that they miss the beloved person. They  therefore meet every stranger with fear, they are afraid of the dark  because they cannot see the beloved person, and are calmed if they can  grasp that person's hand. The effect of childish fears and of the  terrifying stories told by nurses is overestimated if one blames the  latter for producing the fear in children. Children who are predisposed  to fear absorb these stories, which make no impression whatever upon  others; and only such children are predisposed to fear whose sexual  impulse is excessive or prematurely developed, or has become exigent  through pampering. The child behaves here like the adult, that is, it  changes its libido into fear when it cannot bring it to gratification,  and the grown-up who becomes neurotic on account of ungratified libido  behaves in his anxiety like a child; he fears when he is alone, _i.e._,  without a person of whose love he believes himself sure, and who can  calm his fears by means of the most childish measures.[7]    *Incest Barriers.*--If the tenderness of the parents for the child has  luckily failed to awaken the sexual impulse of the child prematurely,  _i.e._, before the physical determinations for puberty appear, and if  that awakening has not gone so far as to cause an unmistakable breaking  through of the psychic excitement into the genital system, it can then  fulfill its task and direct the child at the age of maturity in the  selection of the sexual object. It would, of course, be most natural for  the child to select as the sexual object that person whom it has loved  since childhood with, so to speak, a suppressed libido.[8] But owing to  the delay of sexual maturity time has been gained for the erection  beside the sexual inhibitions of the incest barrier, that moral  prescription which explicitly excludes from the object selection the  beloved person of infancy or blood relation. The observance of this  barrier is above all a demand of cultural society which must guard  against the absorption by the family of those interests which it needs  for the production of higher social units. Society, therefore, uses  every means to loosen those family ties in every individual, especially  in the boy, which are authoritative in childhood only.[9]    The object selection,"]]]
