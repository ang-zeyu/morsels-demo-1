At this thought, he clutched the  steering wheel again. Once more he saw the bent back of the endangered  cyclist, once more he felt rather than saw the seething approach of the  motor bicycle, and then through a long instant he drove helplessly at  the wall....    Hell perhaps is only one such incident, indefinitely prolonged....    Anything might have been there in front of him. And indeed now, out of  the dreamland to which he could not escape something had come, something  that screamed sharply....    \"Good God!\" he cried, \"if I had hit a child! I might have hit a child!\"  The hypothesis flashed into being with the thought, tried to escape and  was caught. It was characteristic of Mr. Britling's nocturnal  imagination that he should individualise this child quite sharply as  rather plain and slender, with reddish hair, staring eyes, and its ribs  crushed in a vivid and dreadful manner, pinned against the wall, mixed  up with some bricks, only to be extracted, oh! _horribly_.    But this was not fair! He had hurt no child! He had merely pitched out  Mr. Direck and broken his arm....    It wasn't his merit that the child hadn't been there!    The child might have been there!    Mere luck.    He lay staring in despair--as an involuntary God might stare at many a  thing in this amazing universe--staring at the little victim his  imagination had called into being only to destroy....      Section 2    If he had not crushed a child other people had. Such things happened.  Vicariously at any rate he had crushed many children....    Why are children ever crushed?    And suddenly all the pain and destruction and remorse of all the  accidents in the world descended upon Mr. Britling.    No longer did he ask why am I such a fool, but why are we all such  fools? He became Man on the automobile of civilisation, crushing his  thousands daily in his headlong and yet aimless career....    That was a trick of Mr. Britling's mind. It had this tendency to spread  outward from himself to generalised issues. Many minds are like that  nowadays. He was not so completely individualised as people are supposed  to be individualised--in our law, in our stories, in our moral  judgments. He had a vicarious factor. He could slip from concentrated  reproaches to the liveliest remorse for himself as The Automobilist in  General, or for himself as England, or for himself as Man. From remorse  for smashing his guest and his automobile he could pass by what was for  him the most imperceptible of transitions to remorse for every accident  that has ever happened through the error of an automobilist since  automobiles began. All that long succession of blunderers became Mr.  Britling. Or rather Mr. Britling became all that vast succession of  blunderers.    These fluctuating lapses from individuation made Mr. Britling a  perplexity to many who judged only by the old personal standards. At  times he seemed a monster of cantankerous self-righteousness, whom  nobody could please or satisfy, but indeed when he was most pitiless  about the faults of his race or nation he was really reproaching  himself, and when he seemed more egotistical and introspective and  self-centred he was really ransacking himself for a clue to that same  confusion of purposes that waste the hope and strength of humanity. And  now through the busy distresses of the night it would have perplexed a  watching angel to have drawn the line and shown when Mr. Britling, was  grieving for his own loss and humiliation and when he was grieving for  these common human weaknesses of which he had so large a share.    And this double refraction of his mind by which a concentrated and  individualised Britling did but present a larger impersonal Britling  beneath, carried with it a duplication of his conscience and sense of  responsibility. To his personal conscience he was answerable for his  private honour and his debts and the Dower House he had made and so on,  but to his impersonal conscience he was answerable for the whole world.  The world from the latter point of view was his egg. He had a  subconscious delusion that he had laid it. He had a subconscious  suspicion that he had let it cool and that it was addled. He had an  urgency to incubate it. The variety and interest of his talk was largely  due to that persuasion, it was a perpetual attempt to spread his mental  feathers over the task before him....      Section 3    After this much of explanation it is possible to go on to the task which  originally brought Mr. Direck to Matching's Easy, the task that  Massachusetts society had sent him upon, the task of organising the  mental unveiling of Mr. Britling. Mr. Direck saw Mr. Britling only in  the daylight, and with an increasing distraction of the attention  towards Miss Cecily Corner. We may see him rather _more_ clearly in the  darkness, without any distraction except his own.    Now the smashing of Gladys was not only the source of a series of  reproaches and remorses directly arising out of the smash; it had also a  wide system of collateral consequences, which were also banging and  blundering their way through the Britling mind. It was extraordinarily  inconvenient in quite another direction that the automobile should be  destroyed. It upset certain plans of Mr. Britling's in a direction  growing right out from all the Dower House world in which Mr. Direck  supposed him to be completely set and rooted. There were certain matters  from which Mr. Britling had been averting his mind most strenuously  throughout the week-end. Now, there was no averting his mind any more.    Mr. Britling was entangled in a love affair. It was, to be exact, and  disregarding minor affinities, his eighth love affair. And the new  automobile, so soon as he could drive it efficiently, was to have played  quite a solvent and conclusive part in certain entangled complications  of this relationship.    A man of lively imagination and quick impulses naturally has love  affairs as he drives himself through life, just as he naturally has  accidents if he drives an automobile.    And the peculiar relations that existed between Mr. Britling and Mrs.  Britling tended inevitably to make these love affairs troublesome,  undignified and futile. Especially when they were viewed from the point  of view of insomnia.    Mr. Britling's first marriage had been a passionately happy one. His  second was by comparison a marriage in neutral tint. There is much to be  said for that extreme Catholic theory which would make marriage not  merely lifelong but eternal. Certainly Mr. Britling would have been a  finer if not a happier creature if his sentimental existence could have  died with his first wife or continued only in his love for their son. He  had married in the glow of youth, he had had two years of clean and  simple loving, helping, quarrelling and the happy ending of quarrels.  Something went out of him into all that, which could not be renewed  again. In his first extremity of grief he knew that perfectly well--and  then afterwards he forgot it. While there is life there is imagination,  which makes and forgets and goes on.    He met Edith under circumstances that did not in any way recall his lost  Mary. He met her, as people say, \"socially\"; Mary, on the other hand,  had been a girl at Newnham while he was a fellow of Pembroke, and there  had been something of accident and something of furtiveness in their  lucky discovery of each other. There had been a flush in it; there was  dash in it. But Edith he saw and chose and had to woo. There was no  rushing together; there was solicitation and assent. Edith was a  Bachelor of Science of London University and several things like that,  and she looked upon the universe under her broad forehead and  broad-waving brown hair with quiet watchful eyes that had nothing  whatever to hide, a thing so incredible to Mr. Britling that he had  loved and married her very largely for the serenity of her mystery. And  for a time after their marriage he sailed over those brown depths  plumbing furiously.    Of course he did not make his former passion for Mary at all clear to  her. Indeed, while he was winning Edith it was by no means clear to  himself. He was making a new emotional drama, and consciously and  subconsciously he dismissed a hundred reminiscences that sought to  invade the new experience, and which would have been out of key with it.  And without any deliberate intention to that effect he created an  atmosphere between himself and Edith in which any discussion of Mary was  reduced to a minimum, and in which Hugh was accepted rather than  explained. He contrived to believe that she understood all sorts of  unsayable things; he invented miracles of quite uncongenial mute  mutuality....    It was over the chess-board that they first began to discover their  extensive difficulties of sympathy. Mr. Britling's play was  characterised by a superficial brilliance, much generosity and extreme  unsoundness; he always moved directly his opponent had done so--and then  reflected on the situation. His reflection was commonly much wiser than  his moves. Mrs. Britling was, as it were, a natural antagonist to her  husband; she was as calm as he was irritable. She was never in a hurry  to move, and never disposed to make a concession. Quietly, steadfastly,  by caution and deliberation, without splendour, without error, she had  beaten him at chess until it led to such dreadful fits of anger that he  had to renounce the game altogether. After every such occasion he would  be at great pains to explain that he had merely been angry with himself.  Nevertheless he felt, and would not let himself think (while she  concluded from incidental heated phrases), that that was not the  complete truth about the outbreak.    Slowly they got through the concealments of that specious explanation."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#19)"],[1,"expressed action, their      present, accepted meaning will still oppose the theory, for the      generality of mankind do not attach to them the idea of _action_.        Thus I have endeavored to present a brief but impartial abstract of      the _modern_ theory of the verb, leaving it with the reader to      estimate it according to its value.        To give a satisfactory definition of the verb, or such a one as      shall be found scientifically correct and unexceptionable, has      hitherto baffled the skill, and transcended the learning, of our      philosophical writers. If its essential quality, as is generally      supposed, is made to consist in _expressing affirmation_, it remains      still to be defined _when_ a verb _expresses_ affirmation. In      English, and in other languages, words appropriated to express      affirmation, are often used without any such force; our idea of      affirmation, in such instances, being the mere _inference of      custom_.        In the sentence,--\"_Think, love_, and _hate_, denote moral actions,\"      the words _think, love_, and _hate_, are nouns, because they are      mere _names_ of actions. So, when I say, \"John, _write_--is an      irregular verb,\" the word _write_ is a noun; but when I say, \"John,      _write_--your copy,\" _write_ is called a verb.        Why is this word considered a noun in one construction, and a verb      in the other, when both constructions, until you pass beyond the      word write, are exactly alike? If write does not _express_ action in      the former sentence, neither does it in the latter, for, in both, it      is introduced in the same manner. On scientific principles, _write_      must be considered a noun in the latter sentence, for it does not      _express_ action, or make an affirmation; but it merely _names_ the      action which I wish John to perform, and affirmation is the      _inferential_ meaning.        The verb in the infinitive, as well as in the imperative mood, is      divested of its affirmative or verbal force. In both these moods, it      is always presented in its _noun-state_.        If, after dinner, I say to a servant, \"_Wine,\"_ he infers, that I      wish him to bring me wine; but all this is not said. If I say,      _Bring_ some _wine_, he, in like manner, understands, that I wish      him to bring me wine; but all that is expressed, is the _name_ of      the action, and of the object of the action. In fact, as much is      done by _inference_, as by actual expression, in every branch of      language, for thought is too quick to be wholly transmitted by      words.        It is generally conceded, that the termination of our verbs, _est,      eth, s, ed_, and, also, of the other parts of speech, were      originally separate words of distinct meaning; and that, although      they have been contracted, and, by the refinement of language, have      been made to coalesce with the words in connexion with which they      are employed, yet, in their present character of terminations, they      retain their primitive meaning and force. To denote that a verbal      name was employed as a verb, the Saxons affixed to it a verbalizing      adjunct; thus, _the_ (to take, hold) was the noun-state of the verb;      and when they used it as a verb, they added the termination _an_;      thus, the_an_. The termination added, was a sign that _affirmation_      was intended. The same procedure has been adopted, and, in many      instances, is still practised, in our language. _An_, originally      affixed to our verbs, in the progress of refinement, was changed to      en, and finally dropped. A few centuries ago, the plural number of      our verbs was denoted by the termination, _en_; thus, they _weren_,      they _loven_; but, as these terminations do not supersede the      necessity of expressing the _subject_ of affirmation, as is the case      in the Latin and Greek verbs, they have been laid aside, as      unnecessary excrescences. For the same reason, we might, without any      disparagement to the language, dispense with the terminations of our      verbs in the singular.        In support of the position, that these terminations were once      separate words, we can trace many of them to their origin. To denote      the feminine gender of some nouns, we affix _ess_; as, heir_ess_,      instructr_ess. Ess_ is a contraction of the Hebrew noun _essa_, a      female. Of our verbs, the termination _est_ is a contraction of      _doest, eth_, of _doeth_, _s_ of _does_. We say, thou _dost_ or      _doest_ love; or thou _lovest_; i.e. _love-dost_, or _love-doest_.      Some believe these terminations to be contractions of _havest,      haveth, has_. We affix _ed_, a contraction of _dede_, to the present      tense of verbs to denote that the action named is _dede, did, doed_,      or _done_.        _To_ and _do_ from the Gothic noun _taui_, signifying _act_ or      _effect_, are, according to Horne Tooke, nearly alike in meaning and      force; and when the custom of affixing some more ancient verbalizing      adjunct, began to be dropped, its place and meaning were generally      supplied by prefixing one of these. When I say, \"I am going _to      walk,\"_ the verbal or affirmative force is conveyed by the use of      _to_, meaning the same as _do_; and _walk_ is employed merely as a      verbal name; that is, I assert that I shall _do_ the act which I      name by the word _walk_, or the act of _walking_.        Perhaps such speculations as these will prove to be more curious      than profitable. If it be made clearly to appear, that, on      scientific principles, whenever the verbal name is unaccompanied by      a verbalizing adjunct, it is in the _noun-state_, and does not      express affirmation, still this theory would be very inconvenient in      practice.        I shall resume this subject in Lecture XI.             *       *       *       *       *      QUESTIONS ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.    What has usually been the object of philosophical investigations of  language? (page 32.)--Do the syntactical dependances and connexions of  words depend on their _original_ import?--Is the power of association  and custom efficient in changing the radical meaning of some  words?--Have words intrinsically a signification of their own; or is  their meaning _inferential_; i.e. such as _custom_ has assigned to them?  (page 38.)--On what _fact_ is based the true, philosophical principle of  classification?--Define philosophical grammar.--Which is supposed to be  the original part of speech?--How were the others formed from that?--How  many parts of speech may be recognised in a scientific development and  arrangement of the principles of our language?--Name them.--What  testimony have we that many things do not act? (page 43.)--Repeat some  of the arguments in favor of, and against, the principle which regards  all verbs as _active_.--In what moods are verbs used in their  _noun-state?_ (page 48.)--Give examples.--What is said of the  terminations _est, eth, s,_ and _en_, and of the words _to_ and _do?_    REMARKS ON VERBS AND NOUNS.    You have already been informed, that verbs are the most important part  of speech in our language; and to convince you of their importance, I  now tell you, that you cannot express a _thought_, or communicate an  _idea_, without making use of a verb, either expressed or implied. Verbs  express, not only _the state_ or _manner of being_, but, likewise, all  the different _actions_ and _movements_ of all creatures and things,  whether animate or inanimate. As yet I have given you only a partial  description of this sort of words; but when you are better prepared to  comprehend the subject, I will explain all their properties, and show  you the proper manner of using them.    A word that is generally a _noun_, sometimes becomes a _verb_; and a  verb is frequently used as a _noun_. These changes depend on the sense  which the word conveys; or, rather, on the office it performs in the  sentence; that is the _manner_ in which it is applied to things. For  instance, _glory_ is generally a noun; as \"The _glory_ of God's throne.\"  But if I say, I _glory_ in religion; or, He _glories_ in wickedness, the  word _glory_ becomes a verb. The _love_ of man is inconstant. In this  sentence, _love_ is a _noun_; in the next, it is a _verb_: They _love_  virtue. He _walks_ swiftly; Scavengers _sweep_ the streets; The ship  _sails_ well. In these phrases, the words _walks, sweep_, and _sails_,  are verbs; in the following they are nouns: Those are pleasant _walks_;  He takes a broad _sweep_; The ship lowered her _sails_.    Thus you see, it is impossible for you to become a grammarian without  exercising your judgment. If you have sufficient resolution to do this,  you will, in a short time, perfectly understand the nature and office of  the different parts of speech, their various properties and relations,  and the rules of syntax that apply to them; and, in a few weeks, be able  to speak and write accurately. But you must not take things for granted,  without examining their propriety and correctness. No. You are not a  mere _automaton_, or _boy-machine_; but a rational being. You ought,  therefore, to _think_ methodically, to _reason_ soundly, and to  _investigate_ every principle critically. Don't be afraid to _think for  yourself_. You know not the high destiny that awaits you. You know not  the height to which you may soar in the scale of intellectual existence.  Go on, then, boldly, and with unyielding perseverance; and if you do not  gain admittance into the temple of fame, strive, at all hazards, to  drink of the fountain which gurgles from its base.    EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.    NOTE 1, TO RULE 12. A noun in the possessive case, should always be  distinguished by the apostrophe, or mark of elision; as, The _nation's_  glory.
