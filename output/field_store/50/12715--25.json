Mr. Denton, who appeared for the defendant, who was absent, said that he  was a very poor man, with a family of five children, and was only the  servant of the real manufacturer, and an ignorant man from the country,  put into the premises to carry on the business, without knowing what the  leaves were intended for. By direction of Mr. Mayo, who conducted the  prosecution, several barrels and bags, filled with the imitation tea,  were then brought into the office, and a sample from each handed round.  To the eye they seemed a good imitation of tea.    The defendant was convicted in the penalty of 500_l._ on the second  count.    _The Attorney-General against Palmer._--This was an action by the  Attorney-General against the defendant, Palmer, charging him with  having in his possession a quantity of sloe-leaves and white-thorn  leaves, fabricated into an imitation of tea.    Mr. Dauncey stated the case to the jury, and observed that the  defendant, Mr. Palmer, was a grocer. It would appear that a regular  manufactory was established in Goldstone-street. The parties by whom the  manufactory was conducted, was a person of the name of Proctor, and  another person named J. Malins. They engaged others to furnish them with  leaves, which, after undergoing a certain process, were sold to and  drank by the public as tea. The leaves, in order to be converted into an  article resembling black tea, were first boiled, then baked upon an iron  plate; and, when dry, rubbed with the hand, in order to produce that  curl which the genuine tea had. This was the most wholesome part of the  operation; for the colour which was yet to be given to it, was produced  by logwood. The green tea was manufactured in a manner more destructive  to the constitution of those by whom it was drank. The leaves, being  pressed and dried, were laid upon sheets of copper, where they received  their colour from an article known by the name of Dutch pink. The  article used in producing the appearance of the fine green bloom,  observable on the China tea, was, however, decidedly a dead poison! He  alluded to verdigris, which was added to the Dutch pink in order to  complete the operation. This was the case which he had to bring before  the jury; and hence it would appear, that, at the moment they were  supposing they were drinking a pleasant and nutritious beverage, they  were, in fact, in all probability, drinking the produce of the hedges  round the metropolis, prepared for the purposes of deception in the most  noxious manner. He trusted he should be enabled to trace to the  possession of the defendant eighty pounds weight of the commodity he had  been describing.    Thomas Jones deposed, that he knew Proctor, and was employed by him at  the latter end of April, 1817, to gather black and white thorn leaves.  Sloe leaves were the black thorn. Witness also knew John Malins, the son  of William Malins, a coffee-roaster; he did not at first know the  purpose for which the leaves were gathered, but afterwards learnt they  were to make imitation tea. Witness did not gather more than one hundred  and a half weight of these leaves; but he employed another person, of  the name of John Bagster, to gather them. He had two-pence per pound for  them. They were first boiled, and the water squeezed from them in a  press. They were afterwards placed over a slow-fire upon sheets of  copper to dry; while on the copper they were rubbed with the hand to  curl them. At the time of boiling there was a little _verdigris_ put  into the water (this applied to green tea only.) After the leaves were  dried, they were sifted, to separate the thorns and stalks. After they  were sifted, more verdigris and some Dutch pink were added. The  verdigris gave the leaves that green bloom observable on genuine tea.    The black tea went through a similar course as the green, except the  application of Dutch pink: a little verdigris was put in the boiling,  and to this was added a small quantity of logwood to dye it, and thus  the manufacture was complete. The drying operation took place on sheets  of iron. Witness knew the defendant, Edward Palmer; he took some of the  mixture he had been describing, to his shop. The first time he took some  was in May, 1817. In the course of that month, or the beginning of June,  he took four or five seven-pound parcels; when he took it there, it was  taken up to the top of the house. Witness afterwards carried some to  Russell-street, which was taken to the top of the house, about one  hundred weight and three quarters; from this quantity he carried  fifty-three pounds weight to the house of the defendant's porter, by the  desire of Mr. Malins; it was in paper parcels of seven pounds each.    John Bagster proved that he had been employed by Malins and Proctor, to  gather sloe and white-thorn leaves: they were taken to Jones's house,  and from thence to Malins' coffee-roasting premises; witness received  two-pence per pound for them; he saw the manufacturing going on, but did  not know much about it: witness saw the leaves on sheets of copper, in  Goldstone-street.

The jury found a verdict for the Crown.--Penalties 70_l._    _The Attorney-General against James Gray._--The defendant submitted to a  verdict for the Crown.--Penalties 120_l._    _The Attorney-General against H. Gilbert, and Powel._--These defendants  submitted to a verdict.--Penalties 140_l._    _The Attorney-General against William Clarke._--This defendant also  submitted to a verdict for the Crown.    _The Attorney-General against George David Bellis._--This defendant  submitted to a verdict for the Crown.    _The Attorney-General against John Horner._--The defendant in this case  was a grocer; it was proved by Jones that he received twenty pounds of  imitation tea.--Verdict for the Crown.--Penalties 210_l._    _The Attorney-General against William Dowling._--This was a grocer.  Jones proved that he delivered seven pounds of imitation tea at Mr.  Dowling's house, and received the money for it, namely 15_s._  9_d._--Penalties 70_l._      METHOD OF DETECTING THE ADULTERATIONS OF TEA.    The adulteration of tea may be evinced by comparing the botanical  characters of the leaves of the two respective trees, and by submitting  them to the action of a few chemical tests.    The shape of the tea-leaf is slender and narrow, as shewn in this  sketch, the edges are deeply serrated, and the end or extremity is  acutely pointed. The texture of the leaf is very delicate, its surface  smooth and glossy, and its colour is a lively pale green.    [Illustration]    The sloe-leaf (and also the white-thorn leaf,) as shewn in this sketch,  is more rounded, and the leaf is obtusely pointed. The serratures or  jags on the edges are not so deep, the surface of the leaf is more  uneven, the texture not so delicate, and the colour is a dark olive  green.    [Illustration]    These characters of course can be observed only after the dried leaves  have been suffered to macerate in water for about twenty-four hours.    The leaves of some sorts of tea may differ in size, but the shape is the  same in all of them; because all the different kinds of tea imported  from China, are the produce of one species of plant, and the difference  between the green and souchong, or black tea, depends chiefly upon the  climate, soil, culture, age, and mode of drying the leaves.    Spurious black tea,[86] slightly moistened, when rubbed on a sheet of  white paper, immediately produces a blueish-black stain; and speedily  affords, when thrown into cold water, a blueish-black tincture, which  instantly becomes reddened by letting fall into it, a drop or two of  sulphuric acid.    Two ounces of the suspected leaves, should be infused in half-a-pint of  cold, soft water, and suffered to stand for about an hour. Genuine tea  produces an amber-coloured infusion, which does not become reddened by  sulphuric acid.    All the samples of spurious green tea (nineteen in number) which I have  examined, were coloured with carbonate of copper (a poisonous  substance,) and not by means of verdigris, or copperas.[87] The latter  substances would instantly turn the tea black; because both these  metallic salts being soluble in water, are acted on by the astringent  matter of the leaves, whether genuine or spurious, and convert the  infusion into ink.    Tea, rendered poisonous by carbonate of copper, speedily imparts to  liquid ammonia a fine sapphire blue tinge. It is only necessary to shake  up in a stopped vial, for a few minutes, a tea-spoonful of the suspected  leaves, with about two table-spoonsful of liquid ammonia, diluted with  half its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#19)"],[1,"commerce, and on account of the growing menace to  peace in the Pacific Ocean, Germany was determined to have an adequate  fleet, which perhaps one day even England might be glad to have  alongside of her own.    In addition to these two incidents, the Emperor had written a letter  to Lord Tweedmouth, who was already then a sick man, and probably not  wholly responsible, in which it was said he had offered advice as to  the increase of the British navy.    I have described these furious indiscretions, as they were called at  the time, together, though they were years apart; for these  utterances, and the constant repetition of his sense of responsibility  to God, and not to the people he governs, are the heart of this whole  contention that the German Emperor is indiscreet, is indiscreet even  to the point of damaging his own prestige, and injuring his country's  interests abroad.    Of all these so-called indiscretions there is the question to ask:  Should these things have been said? Should these things have been  written? There are several things to be said in answer to these  questions. I shall treat each one in turn, but all these statements  told the truth and cleared the air. The Krueger telegram was not  written by the Emperor, and when the worst construction is put upon  it, it expressed what? It was merely the condemnation of freebooting  methods, a condemnation, be it said, that it received from many right-  minded and sincerely patriotic Englishmen, a condemnation too that was  re-echoed from America. Only the honorable and winning personality of  one of the most patriotic and charming men in England, Sir Starr  Jameson, saved the raid from looking like piracy. A brave man spoke  his mind about it, and he happened to be in a position so conspicuous  that the rumble of his words was heard afar.    So far as The Daily Telegraph interview is concerned, the secret  history of the incident has never been fully divulged. One may say,  however, without fear of contradiction that the importance of the  matter was unduly magnified, by those, both at home and abroad, who  had something to gain by exaggeration. It is admitted on all sides by  those best informed that at any rate the Emperor was neither  responsible for the publication, a point to be kept in mind, nor for  the choice of expressions used in the interview.    The letter to Lord Tweedmouth was a friendly communication dealing  with the conditions of the British and German fleets in the past and  present, and without a word in it that might not have been published  in The Times. It was quite innocent of the sinister significance  placed upon it by those who had not seen it; and the British Ministry  declined to publish it for entirely different reasons, reasons in no  way connected with the German Emperor.    As we read The Daily Telegraph interview to-day, it is a plain  document. Every word of it is true. The moment one looks at it from  the point of view, that the Emperor of Germany is sincerely desirous  of an amiable understanding with England, and that he is, for the  peace and quiet of the world, working toward that end, there is no  adverse criticism to be passed upon it. The English are thoroughly and  completely mistaken about the attitude of the German Emperor toward  them. He is far and away the best and most powerful friend they have  in Europe, and I, for one, would be willing to forgive him were he  irritated at their misunderstanding of him. Personally, I have not the  shadow of a doubt that had France or Russia treated the German Emperor  with the cool distrust shown him by the British, the German army and  fleet would have moved ere this.    To those who know the Britisher he is forgiven for those luxuries of  insular stupidity which punctuate his history. I know what a fine  fellow he is, and I pass them by. Mr. Churchill speaks of the German  fleet as a \"luxury\"; but this is only one of those cold-storage  impromptus that a reputation for cleverness must keep on hand, and  when Lord Haldane in a clumsy attempt to praise the German Emperor  speaks of him as \"half English\" I laugh, as one laughs at the story of  fat Gibbon kneeling to propose to a lady and requiring a servant to  get him on his legs again. British courting often needs a lackey to  keep it on its legs.    Could anything be more burningly irritable to the Germans than those  two unnecessary statements? For the moment I am dealing with the  attitude of the Emperor alone. Of the tirades of Chamberlain and  Woltmann, Schmoller, Treitschke, Delbrueck, Zorn, and other  under-exercised professors, one may speak elsewhere. They are as  unpardonable as the yokel rhetoric of our British friends. Of the  Emperor's insistence upon his friendliness, of his outspoken betrayal  of his real feelings, of his audacious policy of telling the blunt  truth, I am, alas, no fair judge, for I am too entirely the advocate  of keeping as few cats in the bag as possible. If these things had not  been said and written, it is true that there would have been no  tumult; having been said and written, I fail to see the slightest  indication in the political life of either Germany or England to-day  that they did harm. Certainly, from his own point of view of what his  position entails, they can hardly, as the radicals in Germany claim,  be considered as unconstitutional or beyond his prerogative.    When the German Emperor says: \"I,\" he refers to the authority and  responsibility and dignity of the German imperial crown. He is not  magnifying his personal importance; he is emphasizing the dignity and  importance of every German citizen. Let us try to understand the  situation before we pass judgment! Both German radicalism and German  socialism are peculiar to Germany, and everywhere misunderstood  abroad. They both demand things of the government for the easement of  their position, they both demand certain privileges, but they do not  seek or want either authority or responsibility. Look at the figures  of their proportionate increase and compare this with their actual  influence in the Reichstag to-day. From 1881 to 1911, here is the  percentage of votes cast by the five representative political parties:                                          1881 1893 1911    The National Liberals...........      14.6 12.9 14.0    The Freisinnige and south German  Volkspartei.....................      23.2 14.2 13.1    The Conservatives, including the  Deutsche and Freikonservative...      23.7 20.4 12.4    The Centrum (Catholic party)....      23.2 19.0 16.3    The social Democrats............       6.1 23.2 34.8    If it were thought for a moment in Germany that the Socialists could  come into real power, their vote and the number of their  representatives in the Reichstag would dwindle away in one single  election.    The average German is no leader of men, no lover of an emergency, no  social or political colonist, and he would shrink from the initiative  and daring and endurance demanded by a real political revolution and a  real change of authority, as a hen from water. The very quality in his  ruler that we take for granted he must dislike is the quality that at  the bottom of his heart he adores, and he reposes upon it as the very  foundation of his sense of security, and as the very bulwark behind  which he makes grimaces and shakes his fist at his enemies. Such men  as the present chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg, a very calm spectator  of his country's doings, and the Emperor himself, both know this.    As he looks at history and at life, it follows that he must be  interested in everything that concerns his people, and not  infrequently take a hand in settling questions, or in pushing  enterprises, that seem too widely apart to be dealt with by one man,  and too far afield for his constitutional obligations to profit by his  interference. Certainly German progress shows that the Germans can  have no ground to quote: \"Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi,\"  of their Emperor.    In the discussion of this question, I may remind my American readers,  although the German constitution is dealt with elsewhere, that there  is one difference between Germany and America politically, that must  never be left out of our calculations. Such constitution and such  rights as the German citizens have, were granted them by their rulers.  The people of Prussia, or of Bavaria, or of Wuertemberg, have not given  certain powers to, and placed certain limitations upon, their rulers;  on the contrary, their rulers have given the people certain of their  own prerogatives and political privileges, and granted to the people  as a favor, a certain share in government and certain powers, that  only so long as seventy years ago belonged to the sovereign alone. It  is not what the people have won and then shared with the ruler, but it  is what the ruler has inherited or won and shared with the people,  that makes the groundwork of the constitutions of the various states,  and of the empire of Germany. Nothing has been taken away from the  people of Prussia or from any other state in Germany that they once  had; but certain rights and privileges have been granted by the rulers  that were once wholly theirs. Bear this in mind, that it is William II  and his ancestors who made Prussia Prussia, and voluntarily gave  Prussians certain political rights, and not the citizens of Prussia  who stormed the battlements of equal rights and made a treaty with  their sovereign.    The King of Prussia is the largest landholder and the richest citizen  of Prussia. We have seen what he expects of his navy and of his army.  Speaking on the 6th of September, 1894, he says: \"Gentlemen,  opposition on the part of the Prussian nobility to their King is a  monstrosity.\"    But arid details are not history, and in this connection let us have  done with them.
