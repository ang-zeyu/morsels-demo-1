He teaches too that the human mind can grow  until it develops new faculties and powers and becomes the Buddha  mind, which sees the whole chain of births, the order of the world,  and the reality of emancipation. As the object of the whole system is  practical, Nirvana is always regarded as a _terminus ad quem_ or an  escape (nissaranam) from this transitory world, and this view is more  accurate as well as more edifying than the view which treats Brahman  or Sunyata as the origin of the universe. When the Vedanta teaches  that this changing troubled world is merely the disguise of that  unchanging and untroubled state into which saints can pass, it is, I  believe, following Gotama's thought, but giving it an expression which  he would have considered imperfect.

This silence makes it _prima facie_ probable that he lived either  before or after Pan Ch'ao's career.    The catalogues of the Chinese Tripitaka state that An-Shih-Kao  (148-170 A.D.) translated the Margabhumi-sutra of Sangharaksha, who  was the chaplain of Kanishka. But this unfortunately proves nothing  except that Kanishka cannot have been very late. The work is not a  scripture for whose recognition some lapse of time must be postulated.  An-Shih-Kao, who came from the west, may very well have translated a  recent and popular treatise.]    [Footnote 168: In this connection we may remember Taranatha's  statement that Kanishka's Council put an end to dissentions which had  lasted about a century.

Materials for forming a picture of Indian life  under his rule are not plentiful but it was clearly an age of fusion.  His hereditary dominions were ample and he had no need to spend his  reign in conquests, but he probably subdued Kashmir as well as Khotan,  Yarkand and Kashgar.[187] Hostages from one of these states were sent  to reside in India and all accounts agree that they were treated with  generosity and that their sojourn improved the relations of Kanishka  with the northern tribes. His capital was Purushapura or Peshawar, and  the locality, like many other features of his reign, indicates a  tendency to amalgamate India with Persia and Central Asia. It was  embellished with masterpieces of Gandharan sculpture and its chief  ornament was a great stupa built by the king for the reception of the  relics of the Buddha which he collected. This building is described by  several Chinese pilgrims[188] and its proportions, though variously  stated, were sufficient to render it celebrated in all the Buddhist  world. It is said to have been several times burnt, and rebuilt, but  so solid a structure can hardly have been totally destroyed by fire  and the greater part of the monument discovered in 1908 probably dates  from the time of Kanishka. The base is a square measuring 285 feet on  each side, with massive towers at the corners, and on each of the four  faces projections bearing staircases. The sides were ornamented with  stucco figures of the Buddha and according to the Chinese pilgrims the  super-structure was crowned with an iron pillar on which were set  twenty-five gilded disks. Inside was found a metal casket, still  containing the sacred bones, and bearing an inscription which presents  two points of great interest. Firstly it mentions \"Agisala the  overseer of works at Kanishka's vihara,\" that is, probably Agesilaus,  a foreigner in the king's service. Secondly it states that the casket  was made \"for the acceptance of the teachers of the Sarvastivadin  sect,\"[189] and the idea that Kanishka was the special patron of the  Mahayana must be reconsidered in the light of this statement.    Legends ascribe Kanishka's fervour for the Buddhist faith not to  education but to conversion. His coinage, of which abundant specimens  have been preserved, confirms this for it presents images of Greek,  Persian, Indian and perhaps Babylonian deities showing how varied was  the mythology which may have mingled with Gandharan Buddhism. The  coins bearing figures of the Buddha are not numerous and, as he  undoubtedly left behind him the reputation of a pious Buddhist, it is  probable that they were struck late in his reign and represent his  last religious phase.[190] Hsuean Chuang[191] repeats some legends  which relate that he was originally anti-Buddhist, and that after his  conversion he summoned a council and built a stupa.    The substance of these legends is probable. Kanishka as a barbarian  but docile conqueror was likely to adopt Buddhism if he wished to keep  abreast of the thought and civilisation of his subjects, for at that  time it undoubtedly inspired the intellect and art of north-western  India. Both as a statesman and as an enquirer after truth he would  wish to promote harmony and stop sectarian squabbles. His action  resembles that of Constantine who after his conversion to Christianity  proceeded to summon the Council of Nicaea in order to stop the  dissensions of the Church and settle what were the tenets of the  religion which he had embraced, a point about which both he and  Kanishka seem to have felt some uncertainty. Our knowledge of  Kanishka's Council depends chiefly on the traditions reported by Hsuean  Chuang[192] which present many difficulties. He tells us that the  king, acting in consultation with Parsva, issued summonses to all the  learned doctors of his realm. They came in such crowds that a severe  test was imposed and only 499 Arhats were selected. There was some  discussion as to the place of meeting but finally Kashmir[193] was  selected and the king built a monastery for the Brethren. When the  Council met, there arose a question as to whether Vasumitra (who is  not further described) should be admitted seeing that he was not an  Arhat but aspired to the career of a Bodhisattva.

Do you think that Homer wrote this under the idea that the soul is a  harmony capable of being led by the affections of the body, and not  rather of a nature which should lead and master them--herself a far  diviner thing than any harmony?    Yes, Socrates, I quite think so.    Then, my friend, we can never be right in saying that the soul is a  harmony, for we should contradict the divine Homer, and contradict  ourselves.    True, he said.    Thus much, said Socrates, of Harmonia, your Theban goddess, who has  graciously yielded to us; but what shall I say, Cebes, to her husband  Cadmus, and how shall I make peace with him?    I think that you will discover a way of propitiating him, said Cebes; I  am sure that you have put the argument with Harmonia in a manner that  I could never have expected. For when Simmias was mentioning his  difficulty, I quite imagined that no answer could be given to him, and  therefore I was surprised at finding that his argument could not sustain  the first onset of yours, and not impossibly the other, whom you call  Cadmus, may share a similar fate.    Nay, my good friend, said Socrates, let us not boast, lest some evil eye  should put to flight the word which I am about to speak. That, however,  may be left in the hands of those above, while I draw near in Homeric  fashion, and try the mettle of your words. Here lies the point:--You  want to have it proven to you that the soul is imperishable and  immortal, and the philosopher who is confident in death appears to you  to have but a vain and foolish confidence, if he believes that he will  fare better in the world below than one who has led another sort of  life, unless he can prove this; and you say that the demonstration of  the strength and divinity of the soul, and of her existence prior to our  becoming men, does not necessarily imply her immortality. Admitting the  soul to be longlived, and to have known and done much in a former state,  still she is not on that account immortal; and her entrance into  the human form may be a sort of disease which is the beginning of  dissolution, and may at last, after the toils of life are over, end in  that which is called death. And whether the soul enters into the body  once only or many times, does not, as you say, make any difference in  the fears of individuals. For any man, who is not devoid of sense,  must fear, if he has no knowledge and can give no account of the soul's  immortality. This, or something like this, I suspect to be your notion,  Cebes; and I designedly recur to it in order that nothing may escape us,  and that you may, if you wish, add or subtract anything.    But, said Cebes, as far as I see at present, I have nothing to add or  subtract: I mean what you say that I mean.    Socrates paused awhile, and seemed to be absorbed in reflection. At  length he said: You are raising a tremendous question, Cebes, involving  the whole nature of generation and corruption, about which, if you like,  I will give you my own experience; and if anything which I say is likely  to avail towards the solution of your difficulty you may make use of it.    I should very much like, said Cebes, to hear what you have to say.    Then I will tell you, said Socrates. When I was young, Cebes, I had a  prodigious desire to know that department of philosophy which is called  the investigation of nature; to know the causes of things, and why  a thing is and is created or destroyed appeared to me to be a lofty  profession; and I was always agitating myself with the consideration of  questions such as these:--Is the growth of animals the result of some  decay which the hot and cold principle contracts, as some have said? Is  the blood the element with which we think, or the air, or the fire? or  perhaps nothing of the kind--but the brain may be the originating  power of the perceptions of hearing and sight and smell, and memory  and opinion may come from them, and science may be based on memory and  opinion when they have attained fixity. And then I went on to examine  the corruption of them, and then to the things of heaven and earth, and  at last I concluded myself to be utterly and absolutely incapable  of these enquiries, as I will satisfactorily prove to you. For I was  fascinated by them to such a degree that my eyes grew blind to things  which I had seemed to myself, and also to others, to know quite well; I  forgot what I had before thought self-evident truths; e.g. such a fact  as that the growth of man is the result of eating and drinking; for when  by the digestion of food flesh is added to flesh and bone to bone, and  whenever there is an aggregation of congenial elements, the lesser  bulk becomes larger and the small man great. Was not that a reasonable  notion?    Yes, said Cebes, I think so.    Well; but let me tell you something more. There was a time when I  thought that I understood the meaning of greater and less pretty well;  and when I saw a great man standing by a little one, I fancied that one  was taller than the other by a head; or one horse would appear to  be greater than another horse: and still more clearly did I seem to  perceive that ten is two more than eight, and that two cubits are more  than one, because two is the double of one.    And what is now your notion of such matters? said Cebes.    I should be far enough from imagining, he replied, that I knew the cause  of any of them, by heaven I should; for I cannot satisfy myself that,  when one is added to one, the one to which the addition is made becomes  two, or that the two units added together make two by reason of the  addition. I cannot understand how, when separated from the other, each  of them was one and not two, and now, when they are brought together,  the mere juxtaposition or meeting of them should be the cause of their  becoming two: neither can I understand how the division of one is the  way to make two; for then a different cause would produce the same  effect,--as in the former instance the addition and juxtaposition of one  to one was the cause of two, in this the separation and subtraction of  one from the other would be the cause. Nor am I any longer satisfied  that I understand the reason why one or anything else is either  generated or destroyed or is at all, but I have in my mind some confused  notion of a new method, and can never admit the other.    Then I heard some one reading, as he said, from a book of Anaxagoras,  that mind was the disposer and cause of all, and I was delighted at this  notion, which appeared quite admirable, and I said to myself: If mind  is the disposer, mind will dispose all for the best, and put each  particular in the best place; and I argued that if any one desired to  find out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of  anything, he must find out what state of being or doing or suffering was  best for that thing, and therefore a man had only to consider the best  for himself and others, and then he would also know the worse, since the  same science comprehended both. And I rejoiced to think that I had found  in Anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired,  and I imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or  round; and whichever was true, he would proceed to explain the cause and  the necessity of this being so, and then he would teach me the nature of  the best and show that this was best; and if he said that the earth was  in the centre, he would further explain that this position was the best,  and I should be satisfied with the explanation given, and not want any  other sort of cause. And I thought that I would then go on and ask him  about the sun and moon and stars, and that he would explain to me their  comparative swiftness, and their returnings and various states, active  and passive, and how all of them were for the best. For I could not  imagine that when he spoke of mind as the disposer of them, he would  give any other account of their being as they are, except that this was  best; and I thought that when he had explained to me in detail the cause  of each and the cause of all, he would go on to explain to me what was  best for each and what was good for all. These hopes I would not have  sold for a large sum of money, and I seized the books and read them as  fast as I could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse.    What expectations I had formed, and how grievously was I disappointed!  As I proceeded, I found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any  other principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, and  water, and other eccentricities. I might compare him to a person who  began by maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions  of Socrates, but who, when he endeavoured to explain the causes of my  several actions in detail, went on to show that I sit here because my  body is made up of bones and muscles; and the bones, as he would say,  are hard and have joints which divide them, and the muscles are elastic,  and they cover the bones, which have also a covering or environment of  flesh and skin which contains them; and as the bones are lifted at their  joints by the contraction or relaxation of the muscles, I am able  to bend my limbs, and this is why I am sitting here in a curved  posture--that is what he would say, and he would have a similar  explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute to sound, and  air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thousand other causes of the  same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which is, that the  Athenians have thought fit to condemn me, and accordingly I have thought  it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence; for  I am inclined to think that these muscles and bones of mine would have  gone off long ago to Megara or Boeotia--by the dog they would, if they  had been moved only "]]]
