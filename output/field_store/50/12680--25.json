And there  within three yards of the East end of the said house, shee saw the  said _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, and _Anne Redferne_ wife of the  said _Thomas Redferne_, and Daughter of the said _Anne Whittle_, alias  _Chattox_: the one on the one side of the Ditch, and the other on the  other: and two Pictures of Clay or Marle lying by them: and the third  Picture the said _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, was making: and the  said _Anne Redferne_ her said Daughter, wrought her Clay or Marle to  make the third picture withall. And this Examinate passing by them,  the said Spirit, called _Tibb_, in the shape of a black Cat, appeared  vnto her this Examinate, and said, turne back againe, and doe as they  doe: To whom this Examinate said, what are they doing? whereunto the  said Spirit said; they are making three Pictures: whereupon she asked  whose pictures they were? whereunto the said Spirit said; they are  the pictures of _Christopher Nutter_, _Robert Nutter_, and _Marie_,  wife of the said _Robert Nutter_: But this Examinate denying to goe  back to helpe them to make the Pictures aforesaid; the said Spirit  seeming to be angrie, therefore shoue or pushed this Examinate into  the ditch, and so shed the Milke which this Examinate had in a Can or  Kit: and so thereupon the Spirit at that time vanished out of this  Examinates sight: But presently after that, the said Spirit appeared  to this Examinate againe in the shape of a Hare, and so went with her  about a quarter of a mile, but said nothing to this Examinate, nor  shee to it.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Examination and euidence of_ IAMES  ROBINSON,[E_b_1] _taken the day and yeare aforesaid._    Before    ROGER NOWEL _Esquire aforesaid, against_ ANNE  WHITTLE, alias CHATTOX, _Prisoner at the Barre  as followeth._ viz.    The said Examinate saith, that about sixe yeares agoe, _Anne  Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, was hired by this Examinates wife to card  wooll;[E_b_2] and so vpon a Friday and Saturday, shee came and carded  wooll with this Examinates wife, and so the Munday then next after  shee came likewise to card: and this Examinates wife hauing newly  tunned drinke into Stands, which stood by the said _Anne Whittle_,  alias _Chattox_: and the said _Ann Whittle_ taking a Dish or Cup, and  drawing drinke seuerall times: and so neuer after that time, for some  eight or nine weekes, they could haue any drinke, but spoiled, and as  this Examinate thinketh was by the meanes of the said _Chattox_. And  further he saith, that the said _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, and  _Anne Redferne_ her said Daughter, are commonly reputed and reported  to bee Witches. And hee also saith, that about some eighteene yeares  agoe, he dwelled with one _Robert Nutter_ the elder, of Pendle  aforesaid. And that yong _Robert Nutter_, who dwelled with his  Grand-father, in the Sommer time, he fell sicke, and in his said  sicknesse hee did seuerall times complaine, that hee had harme by  them: and this Examinate asking him what hee meant by that word  _Them_, He said, that he verily thought that the said _Anne Whittle_,  alias _Chattox_, and the said _Redfernes_ wife, had bewitched him: and  the said _Robert Nutter_ shortly after, being to goe with his then  Master, called Sir _Richard Shattleworth_,[E2_a_] into Wales, this  Examinate heard him say before his then going, vnto the said _Thomas  Redferne_, that if euer he came againe he would get his Father to put  the said _Redferne_ out of his house, or he himselfe would pull it  downe; to whom the said _Redferne_ replyed, saying; when you come back  againe you will be in a better minde: but he neuer came back againe,  but died before Candlemas in Cheshire, as he was comming homeward.    Since the voluntarie confession and examination of a Witch, doth  exceede all other euidence, I spare to trouble you with a multitude of  Examinations, or Depositions of any other witnesses, by reason this  bloudie fact, for the Murder of _Robert Nutter_, vpon so small an  occasion, as to threaten to take away his owne land from such as were  not worthie to inhabite or dwell vpon it, is now made by that which  you haue alreadie heard, so apparant, as no indifferent man will  question it, or rest vnsatisfied: I shall now proceede to set forth  vnto you the rest of her actions, remaining vpon Record. And how  dangerous it was for any man to liue neere these people, to giue them  any occasion of offence, I leaue it to your good consideration.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Examination and voluntarie Confession  of_ ANNE WHITTLE, alias CHATTOX, _taken  at the Fence in the Forrest of Pendle, in the Countie  of Lancaster, the second day of Aprill_, Anno Regni  Regis IACOBI ANGLIAE, Franciae, & Hiberniae, decimo  & Scotiae xlv.    Before    ROGER NOWEL, _Esquire, one of his Maiesties  Iustices of Peace within the Countie of Lancaster._    She the said Examinate saith, That shee was sent for by the wife of  _Iohn Moore_, to helpe drinke that was forspoken or bewitched: at  which time shee vsed this Prayer for the amending of it, _viz._        _A Charme._[E2_b_]        _Three Biters hast thou bitten,        The Hart, ill Eye, ill Tonge:      Three bitter shall be thy Boote,        Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost          a Gods name,      Fiue Pater-nosters, fiue Auies,        and a Creede,      In worship of fiue wounds        of our Lord._    After which time that this Examinate had vsed these prayers, and  amended her drinke, the said _Moores_ wife did chide this Examinate,  and was grieued at her.    And thereupon this Examinate called for her Deuill _Fancie_, and bad  him goe bite a browne Cow of the said _Moores_ by the head, and make  the Cow goe madde: and the Deuill then, in the likenesse of a browne  Dogge, went to the said Cow, and bit her: which Cow went madde  accordingly, and died within six weekes next after, or thereabouts.    Also this Examinate saith, That she perceiuing _Anthonie Nutter_ of  Pendle to fauour _Elizabeth Sothernes_, alias _Dembdike_,[E3_a_1] she,  this Examinate, called _Fancie_ to her, (who appeared like a man) and  bad him goe kill a Cow of the said _Anthonies_; which the said Deuill  did, and that Cow died also.    And further this Examinate saith, That the Deuill, or _Fancie_, hath  taken most of her sight away from her. And further this Examinate  saith, That in Summer last, saue one, the said Deuill, or _Fancie_,  came vpon this Examinate in the night time: and at diuerse and sundry  times in the likenesse of a Beare, gaping as though he would haue  wearied this Examinate.[E3_a_2] And the last time of all shee, this  Examinate, saw him, was vpon Thursday last yeare but one, next before  Midsummer day, in the euening, like a Beare, and this Examinate would  not then speake vnto him, for the which the said Deuill pulled this  Examinate downe.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Examination of_ IAMES DEVICE,[E3_b_]  _sonne of_ ELIZABETH DEVICE, _taken the seuen and  twentieth day of Aprill_, Annoq; Reg.

And further saith, That twelue yeares agoe, the said _Anne Chattox_  at a Buriall at the new Church in Pendle, did take three scalpes of  people, which had been buried, and then cast out of a graue, as she  the said _Chattox_ told this Examinate; and tooke eight teeth out of  the said Scalpes, whereof she kept foure to her selfe, and gaue other  foure to the said _Demdike_, this Examinates Grand-mother: which foure  teeth now shewed to this Examinate, are the foure teeth that the said  _Chattox_ gaue to his said Grand-mother, as aforesaid; which said  teeth haue euer since beene kept, vntill now found by the said _Henry  Hargreiues_ & this Examinate, at the West-end of this Examinates  Grand-mothers house, and there buried in the earth, and a Picture of  Clay there likewise found by them, about halfe a yard ouer in the  earth, where the said teeth lay, which said picture so found was  almost withered away, and was the Picture of _Anne_, _Anthony Nutters_  daughter; as this Examinates Grand-mother told him.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Examination of_ ALLIZON DEVICE  _daughter of_ ELIZABETH DEVICE: _Taken at  Reade, in the Countie of Lancaster, the thirtieth day of  March_, Annoq; Reg.

Before    ROGER NOWEL _of Reade aforesaid, Esquire, one  of his Maiesties Iustices of the Peace, within the said  Countie._    This Examinate saith, that about eleuen yeares agoe, this Examinate  and her mother had their firehouse broken,[E4_a_] and all, or the most  part of their linnen clothes, & halfe a peck of cut oat-meale, and a  quantitie of meale gone, all which was worth twentie shillings, or  aboue: and vpon a Sunday then next after, this Examinate did take a  band and a coife, parcell of the goods aforesaid, vpon the daughter of  _Anne Whittle, alias Chattox_, and claimed them to be parcell of the  goods stolne, as aforesaid.    And this Examinate further saith, That her father, called _Iohn  Deuice_, being afraid, that the said _Anne Chattox_ should doe him or  his goods any hurt by Witchcraft; did couenant with the said _Anne_,  that if she would hurt neither of them, she should yearely haue one  Aghen-dole of meale;[E4_b_1] which meale was yearely paid, vntill the  yeare which her father died in, which was about eleuen yeares since:  Her father vpon his then-death-bed, taking it that the said _Anne  Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, did bewitch him to death, because the said  meale was not paid the last yeare.    And she also saith, That about two yeares agone, this Examinate being  in the house"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pensées (#19)"],[1," We do not say that those who seek the  noonday sun, or water in the sea, shall find them; and hence the  evidence of God must not be of this nature. So it tells us elsewhere:  _Vere tu es Deus absconditus_.[94]      243    It is an astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever made use of  nature to prove God. They all strive to make us believe in Him. David,  Solomon, etc., have never said, \"There is no void, therefore there is a  God.\" They must have had more knowledge than the most learned people who  came after them, and who have all made use of this argument. This is  worthy of attention.      244    \"Why! Do you not say yourself that the heavens and birds prove God?\" No.  \"And does your religion not say so?\" No. For although it is true in a  sense for some souls to whom God gives this light, yet it is false with  respect to the majority of men.      245    There are three sources of belief: reason, custom, inspiration. The  Christian religion, which alone has reason, does not acknowledge as her  true children those who believe without inspiration. It is not that she  excludes reason and custom. On the contrary, the mind must be opened to  proofs, must be confirmed by custom, and offer itself in humbleness to  inspirations, which alone can produce a true and saving effect. _Ne  evacuetur crux Christi._[95]      246    _Order._--After the letter _That we ought to seek God_, to write the  letter _On removing obstacles_; which is the discourse on \"the  machine,\"[96] on preparing the machine, on seeking by reason.      247    _Order._--A letter of exhortation to a friend to induce him to seek. And  he will reply, \"But what is the use of seeking? Nothing is seen.\" Then  to reply to him, \"Do not despair.\" And he will answer that he would be  glad to find some light, but that, according to this very religion, if  he believed in it, it will be of no use to him, and that therefore he  prefers not to seek. And to answer to that: The machine.      248    _A letter which indicates the use of proofs by the machine._--Faith is  different from proof; the one is human, the other is a gift of God.  _Justus ex fide vivit._[97] It is this faith that God Himself puts into  the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument, _fides ex  auditu_;[98] but this faith is in the heart, and makes us not say  _scio_, but _credo_.      249    It is superstition to put one's hope in formalities; but it is pride to  be unwilling to submit to them.      250    The external must be joined to the internal to obtain anything from God,  that is to say, we must kneel, pray with the lips, etc., in order that  proud man, who would not submit himself to God, may be now subject to  the creature.[99] To expect help from these externals is superstition;  to refuse to join them to the internal is pride.      251    Other religions, as the pagan, are more popular, for they consist in  externals. But they are not for educated people. A purely intellectual  religion would be more suited to the learned, but it would be of no use  to the common people. The Christian religion alone is adapted to all,  being composed of externals and internals. It raises the common people  to the internal, and humbles the proud to the external; it is not  perfect without the two, for the people must understand the spirit of  the letter, and the learned must submit their spirit to the letter.      252    For we must not misunderstand ourselves; we are as much automatic as  intellectual; and hence it comes that the instrument by which conviction  is attained is not demonstrated alone. How few things are demonstrated?  Proofs only convince the mind. Custom is the source of our strongest and  most believed proofs. It bends the automaton, which persuades the mind  without its thinking about the matter. Who has demonstrated that there  will be a to-morrow, and that we shall die? And what is more believed?  It is, then, custom which persuades us of it; it is custom that makes  so many men Christians; custom that makes them Turks, heathens,  artisans, soldiers, etc. (Faith in baptism is more received among  Christians than among Turks.) Finally, we must have recourse to it when  once the mind has seen where the truth is, in order to quench our  thirst, and steep ourselves in that belief, which escapes us at every  hour; for always to have proofs ready is too much trouble. We must get  an easier belief, which is that of custom, which, without violence,  without art, without argument, makes us believe things, and inclines all  our powers to this belief, so that out soul falls naturally into it. It  is not enough to believe only by force of conviction, when the automaton  is inclined to believe the contrary. Both our parts must be made to  believe, the mind by reasons which it is sufficient to have seen once in  a lifetime, and the automaton by custom, and by not allowing it to  incline to the contrary. _Inclina cor meum, Deus._[100]    The reason acts slowly, with so many examinations, and on so many  principles, which must be always present, that at every hour it falls  asleep, or wanders, through want of having all its principles present.  Feeling does not act thus; it acts in a moment, and is always ready to  act. We must then put our faith in feeling; otherwise it will be always  vacillating.      253    Two extremes: to exclude reason, to admit reason only.      254    It is not a rare thing to have to reprove the world for too much  docility. It is a natural vice like credulity, and as pernicious.  Superstition.      255    Piety is different from superstition.    To carry piety as far as superstition is to destroy it.    The heretics reproach us for this superstitious submission. This is to  do what they reproach us for ...    Infidelity, not to believe in the Eucharist, because it is not seen.    Superstition to believe propositions. Faith, etc.      256    I say there are few true Christians, even as regards faith. There are  many who believe but from superstition. There are many who do not  believe solely from wickedness. Few are between the two.    In this I do not include those who are of truly pious character, nor all  those who believe from a feeling in their heart.      257    There are only three kinds of persons; those who serve God, having found  Him; others who are occupied in seeking Him, not having found Him; while  the remainder live without seeking Him, and without having found Him.  The first are reasonable and happy, the last are foolish and unhappy;  those between are unhappy and reasonable.      258    _Unusquisque sibi Deum fingit._[101]    Disgust.      259    Ordinary people have the power of not thinking of that about which they  do not wish to think. \"Do not meditate on the passages about the  Messiah,\" said the Jew to his son. Thus our people often act. Thus are  false religions preserved, and even the true one, in regard to many  persons.    But there are some who have not the power of thus preventing thought,  and who think so much the more as they are forbidden. These undo false  religions, and even the true one, if they do not find solid arguments.      260    They hide themselves in the press, and call numbers to their rescue.  Tumult.    _Authority._--So far from making it a rule to believe a thing because  you have heard it, you ought to believe nothing without putting yourself  into the position as if you had never heard it.    It is your own assent to yourself, and the constant voice of your own  reason, and not of others, that should make you believe.    Belief is so important! A hundred contradictions might be true. If  antiquity were the rule of belief, men of ancient time would then be  without rule. If general consent, if men had perished?    False humanity, pride.    Lift the curtain. You try in vain; if you must either believe, or deny,  or doubt. Shall we then have no rule? We judge that animals do well what  they do. Is there no rule whereby to judge men?    To deny, to believe, and to doubt well, are to a man what the race is to  a horse.    Punishment of those who sin, error.      261    Those who do not love the truth take as a pretext that it is disputed,  and that a multitude deny it. And so their error arises only from this,  that they do not love either truth or charity. Thus they are without  excuse.      262    Superstition and lust. Scruples, evil desires. Evil fear; fear, not such  as comes from a belief in God, but such as comes from a doubt whether He  exists or not. True fear comes from faith; false fear comes from doubt.  True fear is joined to hope, because it is born of faith, and because  men hope in the God in whom they believe. False fear is joined to  despair, because men fear the God in whom they have no belief. The  former fear to lose Him; the latter fear to find Him.      263    \"A miracle,\" says one, \"would strengthen my faith.\" He says so when he  does not see one. Reasons, seen from afar, appear to limit our view; but  when they are reached, we begin to see beyond. Nothing stops the  nimbleness of our mind. There is no rule, say we, which has not some  exceptions, no truth so general which has not some aspect in which it  fails. It is sufficient that it be not absolutely universal to give us a  pretext for applying the exceptions to the present subject, and for  saying, \"This is not always true; there are therefore cases where it is  not so.\" It only remains to show that this is one of them; and that is  why we are very awkward or unlucky, if we do not find one some day.      264    We do not weary of eating and sleeping every day, for hunger and  sleepiness recur. Without that we should weary of them. So, without the  hunger for spiritual things, we weary of them. Hunger after  righteousness, the eighth beatitude.[102]      265    Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of  what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them.      266    How many stars have"]]]
