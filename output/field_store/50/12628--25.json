No  painting is perfect, and no acting is perfect.  No actor ever played a  part to absolute perfection.  It is just as impossible for an actor to  simulate nature completely upon the stage as it is impossible for the  painter to portray on canvas the waves of the ocean, the raging storm  clouds, or the horrors of conflagration.    The nearer the artist gets to nature, the greater he is.  We may  admire Rubens and Rembrandt and Vandyke and Gainsborough and Turner,  but who will dare to say that any one of their pictures is faultless?  We shall learn much from them all, but quite as much what to avoid as  what to emulate.  But when you discover their faults, do not forget  their virtues.  Look, and realise what it means to be able to do so  much, And the actor's art is even more difficult!  For its execution  must be immediate and spontaneous.  The word is delivered, the action  is done, and the picture is painted!  Can I pause and say, \"Ladies and  gentlemen, that is not the way I wanted to do this, or to say that; if  you will allow me to try again, I think I can improve upon it?\"        SELF-CRITICISM    The most severe critic can never tell me more, or scold me more than I  scold myself.  I have never left the stage satisfied with myself.  And  I am convinced that every artist feels as I do about his work.  It is  the undoubted duty of the critic to criticise, and that means to blame  as well as to praise; and it must be confessed that, taking all things  into consideration, the critics of this country are actuated by  honesty of purpose and kindliness of spirit, and very often their work  is, in addition, of marked literary value.  Occasionally we will still  meet the man who is anxious to impress his fellow citizens with the  fact that he has been abroad, and tinctures all his views of plays and  actors with references to Herr Dinkelspiegel or Frau Mitterwoorzer; or  who, having spent a few hours in Paris, is forced to drag in by the  hair Monsieur Popin or Mademoiselle Fifine.  But as a matter of fact,  is not the interpretation of tragedy and comedy by the American stage  superior to the German and French?--for the whole endeavour in this  country has been toward a closer adherence to nature.  In France and  in Germany the ancient method of declamation still prevails, and the  great speeches of Goethe and Schiller and Racine and Corneille are to  all intents and purposes intoned.  No doubt this sounds very fine in  German and French, but how would you like it now in English?    The old-time actor had peculiar and primitive views as to elocution  and its uses.  I remember a certain old friend of mine, who, when he  recited the opening speech in \"Richard III.,\" and arrived at the line  \"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried,\" suggested the deep bosom of  the ocean by sending his voice down into his boots.  Yet these were  fine actors, to whom certain young gentlemen, who never saw them,  constantly refer.  The methods of the stage have completely changed,  and with them the tastes of the people.  The probability is that some  of the old actors of only a few years ago would excite much merriment  in their delineation of tragedy.  A very great tragedian of a past  generation was wont, in the tent scene in \"Richard III.,\" to hold a  piece of soap in his mouth, so that, after the appearance of the  ghosts, the lather and froth might dribble down his chin! and he  employed, moreover, a trick sword, which rattled hideously; and, what  with his foam-flecked face, his rolling eyes, his inarticulate groans,  and his rattling blade, the small boy in the gallery was scared into a  frenzy of vociferous delight!    Yet, whilst we have discarded these somewhat crude methods, we have  perhaps allowed ourselves to wander too far in the other direction,  and the critics are quite justified in demanding in many cases greater  virility and force.  The simulation of suppressed power is very useful  and very advisable, but when the fire-bell rings the horses have got  to come out, and rattle and race down the street, and rouse the town!        DISCIPLINE IMPERATIVE    Whilst we are on the subject of these creations of the poets and the  actors, do you understand how important is discipline on the stage?  How can an actor be away from this earth, moving before you in the  spirit he has conjured up, only to be dragged back to himself and his  actual surroundings of canvas and paint and tinsel and limelights by  some disturbing influence in the audience or on the stage?  If you  want the best, if you love the art, foster it.  It is worthy of your  gentlest care and your kindest, tenderest thought.  Your silence is  often more indicative of appreciation than your applause.  The actor  does not need your applause in order to know when you are in sympathy  with him.    He feels very quickly whether you are antagonistic or friendly.  He  cares very little for the money, but a great deal for your affection  and esteem.  Discipline on the stage has almost entirely disappeared,  and year after year the exercise of our art becomes more difficult.  I  am sorry to say some newspapers are, unwittingly perhaps, largely  responsible for this.  When an editor discharges a member of his force  for any good and sufficient reason--and surely a man must be permitted  to manage and control his own business--no paper will publish a  two-column article, with appropriate cuts, detailing the wrongs of the  discharged journalist, and the hideous crime of the editor!  Even an  editor--and an editor is supposed to be able to stand almost  anything--would become weary after a while; discipline would cease,  and your newspapers would be ill-served.  Booth, Jefferson, and other  actors soon made up their minds that the easiest road was the best for  them.  Mr. Booth left the stage management entirely to Mr. Lawrence  Barrett and others, and Mr. Jefferson praised everybody and every  thing.  But this is not good for the stage.  My career on the stage is  nearly over, and until, shortly, I bid it farewell, I shall continue  to do my best; but we are all doing it under ever-growing  difficulties.  Actors on the stage are scarce, actors off the stage,  as I have demonstrated, I hope, are plentiful.  Life insurance  presidents--worthy presidents, directors, and trustees--have been so  busy acting their several parts in the past, and are in the present so  busy trying to unact them, men are so occupied from their childhood  with the mighty dollar, the race for wealth is so strenuous and  all-entrancing, that imagination is dying out; and imagination is  necessary to make a poet or an actor; the art of acting is the  crystallisation of all arts.  It is a diamond in the facets of which  is mirrored every art.  It is, therefore, the most difficult of all  arts.  The education of a king is barely sufficient for the education  of the comprehending and comprehensive actor.  If he is to satisfy  every one, he should possess the commanding power of a Caesar, the  wisdom of Solomon, the eloquence of Demosthenes, the patience of Job,  the face and form of Antinous, and the strength and endurance of  Hercules.        DRAMATIC VICISSITUDES    The stage is not likely to die of neglect anywhere.  But at this  moment it cannot be denied that the ship of the stage is drifting  somewhat hither and thither, Every breath of air and every current of  public opinion impels it first in one direction and then in another,  At one moment we may be said to be in the doldrums of the English  society drama, or we are sluggishly rolling along in a heavy ground  swell, propelled by a passing cat's paw of revivals of old melodramas.  Again we catch a very faint northerly breeze from Ibsen, or a  southeaster from Maeterlinck and Hauptmann.  Sometimes we set our  sails to woo that ever-clearing breeze of Shakespeare, only to be  forced out of our course by a sputter of rain, an Irish mist, and half  a squall from George Bernard Shaw; but the greater part of the time  the ship of the stage is careering wildly under bare poles, with a man  lashed to the helm (and let us hope that, like Ulysses, he has cotton  wool in his ears), before a hurricane of comic opera.  We need a  recognised stage and a recognised school.  America has become too  great, and its influence abroad too large, for us to afford to have  recourse to that ancient and easy method of criticism which decries  the American and extols the foreign.  That is one of those last  remnants of colonialism and provincialism which must depart forever.        A NATIONAL THEATRE    What could not be done for the people of this land, were we to have a  great and recognised theatre!  Consider our speech, and our manner of  speech!  Consider our voices, and the production of our voices!  Consider the pronunciation of words, and the curious use of vowels!  Let us say we have an established theatre, to which you come not only  for your pleasure, but for your education.  Of what immense advantage  this would be if behind its presiding officer there stood a board of  literary directors, composed of such men as William Winter, Howells,  Edward Everett Hale, and Aldrich, and others equally fine, and the  presidents of the great universities.  These men might well decide how  the American language should be spoken in the great American theatre,  and we should then have an authority in this country at last for the  pronunciation of certain words.  It would finally be decided whether  to say fancy or fahncy--dance or dahnce--advertisement or  advertysement, and so with many other words; whether to call the  object of our admiration \"real elegant\"--whether we should say \"I  admire\" to do this or that, and whether we should say \"I guess\"  instead of \"I think.\"  And the voice!  The education of the American  speaking voice is, I am sure all will agree, of immense importance.  It is difficult "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#19)"],[1,"take  it.    A woman was accused of stealing maize, and the chief here sent all his  people yesterday, plundered all she had in her house and garden, and  brought her husband bound in thongs till he shall pay a goat: she is  said to be innocent.    Monangoi does this by fear of the traders here; and, as the people tell  him, as soon as they are gone the vengeance he is earning by injustice  on all sides will be taken: I told the chief that his head would be cut  off as soon as the traders leave, and so it will be; and Kasessa's also.    Three men went from Katomba to Kasongo's to buy Viramba, and a man was  speared belonging to Kasongo, these three then fired into a mass of men  who collected, one killed two, another three, and so on; so now that  place is shut up from traders, and all this country will be closed as  soon as the Manyuema learn that guns are limited in their power of  killing, and especially in the hands of slaves, who cannot shoot, but  only make a noise. These Suaheli are the most cruel and bloodthirsty  missionaries in existence, and withal so impure in talk and acts,  spreading disease everywhere. The Lord sees it.    _28th December, 1870._--Moenembegg, the most intelligent of the two sons  of Moenekuss, in power, told us that a man was killed and eaten a few  miles from this yesterday: hunger was the reason assigned. On speaking  of tainted meat, he said that the Manyuema put meat in water for two  days to make it putrid and smell high. The love of high meat is the only  reason I know for their cannibalism, but the practice is now hidden on  account of the disgust that the traders expressed against open  man-eating when they first arrived.    Lightning was very near us last night. The Manyuema say that when it is  so loud fishes of large size fall with it, an opinion shared by the  Arabs, but the large fish is really the _Clarias Capensis_ of Smith, and  it is often seen migrating in single file along the wet grass for miles:  it is probably this that the Manyuema think falls from the lightning.    The strangest disease I have seen in this country seems really to be  broken-heartedness, and it attacks free men who have been captured and  made slaves. My attention was drawn to it when the elder brother of Syde  bin Habib was killed in Rua by a night attack, from a spear being  pitched through his tent into his side. Syde then vowed vengeance for  the blood of his brother, and assaulted all he could find, killing the  elders, and making the young men captives. He had secured a very large  number, and they endured the chains until they saw the broad River  Lualaba roll between them and their free homes; they then lost heart.  Twenty-one were unchained as being now safe; however, all ran away at  once, but eight, with many others still in chains, died in three days  after crossing. They ascribed their only pain to the heart, and placed  the hand correctly on the spot, though many think that the organ stands  high up under the breast bone. Some slavers expressed surprise to me  that they should die, seeing they had plenty to eat and no work. One  fine boy of about twelve years was carried, and when about to expire,  was kindly laid down on the side of the path, and a hole dug to deposit  the body in. He, too, said he had nothing the matter with him, except  pain in his heart: as it attacks only the free (who are captured and  never slaves), it seems to be really broken-hearts of which they die.    [Livingstone's servants give some additional particulars in answer to  questions put to them about this dreadful history. The sufferings  endured by these unfortunate captives, whilst they were hawked about in  different directions, must have been shocking indeed; many died because  it was impossible for them to carry a burden on the head whilst marching  in the heavy yoke or \"taming stick,\" which weighs from 30 lbs. to 40  lbs. as a rule, and the Arabs knew that if once the stick were taken  off, the captive would escape on the first opportunity. Children for a  time would keep up with wonderful endurance, but it happened sometimes  that the sound of dancing and the merry tinkle of the small drums would  fall on their ears in passing near to a village; then the memory of home  and happy days proved too much for them; they cried and sobbed, the  \"broken-heart\" came on, and they rapidly sank.    The adults as a rule came into the slave-sticks from treachery, and had  never been slaves before. Very often the Arabs would promise a present  of dried fish to villagers if they would act as guides to some distant  point, and as soon as they were far enough away from their friends they  were seized and pinned into the yoke from which there is no escape.  These poor fellows would expire in the way the Doctor mentions, talking  to the last of their wives and children who would never know what had  become of them. On one occasion twenty captives succeeded in escaping as  follows. Chained together by the neck, and in the custody of an Arab  armed with a gun, they were sent off to collect wood; at a given signal,  one of them called the guard to look at something which he pretended he  had found: when he stooped down they threw themselves upon him and  overpowered him, and after he was dead managed to break the chain and  make off in all directions.]    Rice sown on 19th October was in ear in seventy days. A leopard killed  my goat, and a gun set for him went off at 10 P.M.--the ball broke both  hind legs and one fore leg, yet he had power to spring up and bite a man  badly afterwards; he was a male, 2 feet 4 inches at withers, and 6 feet  8 inches from tip of nose to end of tail.    _1st January, 1871._--O Father! help me to finish this work to Thy  honour.    Still detained at Bambarre, but a caravan of 500 muskets is reported  from the coast: it may bring me other men and goods.    Rain daily. A woman was murdered without cause close by the camp; the  murderer said she was a witch and speared her: the body is exposed till  the affair is settled, probably by a fine of goats.    The Manyuema are the most bloody, callous savages I know; one puts a  scarlet feather from a parrot's tail on the ground, and challenges those  near to stick it in the hair: he who does so must kill a man or woman!    Another custom is that none dare wear the skin of the musk cat, Ngawa,  unless he has murdered somebody: guns alone prevent them from killing us  all, and for no reason either.    _16th January, 1871._--Ramadan ended last night, and it is probable my  people and others from the coast will begin to travel after three days  of feasting. It has been so rainy I could have done little though I had  had people.    _22nd January, 1871._--A party is reported to be on the way hither. This  is likely enough, but reports are so often false that doubts arise.  Mohamad says he will give men when the party of Hassani comes, or when  Dugumbe arrives.    _24th January, 1871._--Mohamad mentioned this morning that Moene-mokaia,  and Moeneghera his brother, brought about thirty slaves from Katanga to  Ujiji, affected with swelled thyroid glands or \"_Goitre_,\" and that  drinking the water of Tanganyika proved a perfect cure to all in a very  few days. Sometimes the swelling went down in two days after they began  to use the water, in their ordinary way of cooking, washing, and  drinking: possibly some ingredient of the hot fountain that flows into  it affects the cure, for the people on the Lofubu, in Nsama's country,  had the swelling. The water in bays is decidedly brackish, while the  body of Tanganyika is quite fresh.    The odour of putrid elephant's meat in a house kills parrots: the  Manyuema keep it till quite rotten, but know its fatal effects on their  favourite birds.    _27th January, 1871._--Safari or caravan reported to be near, and my men  and goods at Ujiji.    _28th January, 1871._--A safari, under Hassani and Ebed, arrived with  news of great mortality by cholera (_Towny_), at Zanzibar, and my  \"brother,\" whom I conjecture to be Dr. Kirk, has fallen. The men I wrote  for have come to Ujiji, but did not know my whereabouts; when told by  Katomba's men they will come here, and bring my much longed for letters  and goods. 70,000 victims in Zanzibar alone from cholera, and it spread  inland to the Masoi and Ugogo! Cattle shivered, and fell dead: the  fishes in the sea died in great numbers; here the fowls were first  seized and died, but not from cholera, only from its companion. Thirty  men perished in our small camp, made still smaller by all the able men  being off trading at the Metamba, and how many Manyuema died we do not  know; the survivors became afraid of eating the dead.    Formerly the Cholera kept along the sea-shore, now it goes far inland,  and will spread all over Africa; this we get from Mecca filth, for  nothing was done to prevent the place being made a perfect cesspool of  animals' guts and ordure of men.[11] A piece of skin bound round the  chest of a man, and half of it hanging down, prevents waste of strength,  and he forgets and fattens.    Ebed's party bring 200 frasilahs of all sorts of beads; they will cross  Lualaba, and open a new field on the other, or Young's Lualaba: all  Central Africa will soon be known: the evils inflicted by these Arabs  are enormous, but probably not greater than the people inflict on each  other. Merere has turned against the Arabs, and killed one; robbing  several others of all they had, though he has ivory sufficient to send  down 7000 lbs. to the coast, and receive loads of goods for 500 men in  return. He looks as if insane, and probably is so, and will soon be  killed. His insanity may be the effect of pombe, of which he drinks  largely, and his people may have told him that the Arabs were plotting  with Goambari. He restored Mohamad's ivory and slaves, and sent for the  other traders who had fled, saying his people had spoken badly, and he  would repay all losses.    "]]]
