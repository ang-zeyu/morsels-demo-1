Wouldn't you like to help?\"    \"Like! I'd sell my birthright to do it!\" gasped Winona. \"But I'm  fearfully sorry; I'm cataloguing for Margaret!\"    \"Then I mustn't take you away from the General! It's a nuisance though,  for you'd have done very well, and I don't know who else I can get.\"    Winona considered it was one of the sharpest disappointments she had  ever gone through.    \"Oh, the grizzly bad luck of it!\" she wailed to Garnet. \"It would have  been idyllic to coach those kids. And it would have given me such a leg  up with Kirsty! To think I've lost my chance!\"    \"I suppose Margaret might get some one else to do cataloguing?\"    \"I dare say: but I couldn't possibly ask her, and I'm sure Kirsty won't.  No, I'm done for!\"    School etiquette is very strict, and Winona would have perished sooner  than resign her library duties. She felt a martyr, but resolved to smile  through it all. Garnet contemplated the problem at leisure during her  drawing lesson, and arrived at a daring conclusion. Without consulting  her friend she marched off at four o'clock to the prefects' room, a  little sanctum on the ground floor where the minutes' books of the  various guilds and societies were kept, and where the school officers  could hold meetings and transact business.    As she expected, Margaret was there alone, and said \"Come in\" in answer  to her rap at the door. The members of the Sixth kept much on their  dignity, so it was rather a formidable undertaking even for a Fifth Form  girl to interrupt the head of the school. Margaret looked up  inquiringly as Garnet entered.    \"Yes, I'm fearfully busy,\" she replied to the murmured question. \"What  is it? I can give you five minutes, but no more, so please be brief.\"    Thus urged, Garnet, though greatly embarrassed, did not beat about the  bush.    \"I've come to ask a frightfully cheeky thing,\" she blurted out. \"Kirsty  wants Winona to coach the kids at hockey, and Winona's cataloguing for  you, so of course she can't--and--\" but here Garnet's courage failed  her, so she paused.    \"Do you mean that Winona would prefer to help with the juniors?\"    \"She'd be torn in pieces rather than let me say so, but she's just crazy  over hockey. I hope I haven't made any mischief! Win doesn't know I've  come.\"    \"All right. I understand. I'll see what can be done in the matter,\"  returned the General, opening her books as a sign of dismissal.    Garnet was not at all sure whether her mission had succeeded or the  reverse, but the next day Margaret sent for Winona.    \"I hear Kirsty wants you for a hockey coach. Just at present I think  games are of more importance in the school than the library, so please  report yourself to her, and say I've taken your name off my list. You've  done very well here, but I'm going to lend you to Kirsty for a while.\"    Winona was so astounded she hardly knew whether to stammer out  apologies, gratitude, or regrets, and was intensely relieved when the  head girl cut her short kindly but firmly, and sent her away. She lost  no time in seeking out the Games Captain.    \"Very decent of Margaret,\" remarked Kirsty. \"It's got me out of a hole,  for I couldn't find anybody else with that special time free. You'll do  your best I know?\"    \"_Rather_!\" beamed Winona ecstatically.    Under her tuition the children's play improved fast. Kirsty said  little--she was not given to over-praising people--but Winona felt she  noticed and approved.    Among the season's fixtures perhaps the most important was the match  with the Seaton Ladies' Hockey Club that was to come off on March 7th.  Their opponents possessed a fair reputation in the city, so it would  behove the school to \"play up for all they were worth,\" as Kirsty  expressed it. It would be a glorious opportunity of showing their  capabilities to the world at large, and demonstrating that they meant to  take their due place in local athletics.    Three days before the event, Kirsty appeared in the morning with the air  of a tragedy queen.    \"What's the matter?\" queried Patricia. \"You've a face as long as a  fiddle!\"    \"Matter enough! Barbara Jennings is laid up with influenza! What'll  become of the match I don't know. It makes me feel rocky. Where's  Margaret? I want to confab. Did you ever hear of such grizzly luck in  your life?\"    At five minutes past eleven, when Winona was eating her lunch in the  gymnasium, Kirsty tapped her on the shoulder.    \"I've something to tell you, Winona Woodward. You're to play for the  School on Saturday instead of Barbara.\"    Winona swallowed a piece of biscuit with foolhardy haste. She could  scarcely believe the news, so great was its magnitude. To be asked to  fill a vacant place in the team was beyond her wildest dreams.    \"Thanks most _immensely_!\" she stammered, with her eyes shining like  stars.    Through the next few days Winona simply lived for Saturday. To be able  to represent the School! The glorious thought was never for a moment  absent from her mind. She even ventured to tell Aunt Harriet the honor  that had been thrust upon her, and was astonished at the interest with  which her information was received.    On the Saturday afternoon the High School turned up almost in full force  to view the match; juniors were keen as seniors, and the children whom  Winona had coached were wild with excitement. The field was packed with  spectators, for the Ladies' Club had brought many friends. It was even  rumored that a reporter from the Seaton _Weekly Graphic_ was present.  The High School team in navy blue gymnasium costumes, bare heads and  close-plaited pigtails, looked neat and trim and very business-like. \"A  much fitter set than we showed last year!\" murmured Margaret with  satisfaction. All eyes were riveted on the field as the two opponents  stood out to \"bully\" and the sticks first clashed together. Winona, her  face aglow with excitement, waited a chance to run. A little later her  opportunity came: she dashed into the masses of the opponents' force,  and with one magnificent stroke swept the ball well onward towards the  goal.    \"Oh! how precious!\" shouted the girls.    Nobody had imagined Winona capable of such a feat. She at once became  the focus of all eyes. It had not occurred to the High School that there  was a real possibility of their winning the match. They had expected to  make a gallant fight and be defeated, retiring with all the honors of  war. Perhaps the Ladies' Club team, who had come to the field secure of  victory, began to feel pangs of uneasiness under their white jerseys.  The situation was supreme. The score had become even. Could the School  possibly do it? That was the question. All looked to Winona for the  answer. She was playing like one inspired. She had not realized her own  capacities before: the wild excitement of the moment seemed to lend  wings to her feet and strength and skill to her arm. One heroic,  never-to-be-forgotten stroke, and the ball was spinning between the  posts. It was a magnificent finish. Frantic applause rose up from the  spectators. The High School cheered its champions in a glorious roar of  victory. The Ladies' Club team were magnanimous enough to offer  congratulations, and their captain shook hands with Winona.    \"Glad to see how your standard's gone up!\" she remarked to Kirsty  aside. \"That half-back of yours is worth her salt!\"    Kirsty was literally purring with satisfaction. Last year the High  School had been badly beaten in more than half its matches. This was  indeed a new page in its records.    On Monday morning Winona received a message summoning her to the  prefects' room. She found Margaret, Kirsty, and the other school  officers assembled there.    \"Winona Woodward,\" said the head girl, \"we have decided to present you  with the School Service Badge, in recognition of your play on Saturday.  It is felt that you really secured the match, and as this is our first  great victory we consider you deserve to have it recorded in your favor.  Your name has been entered in the book. Come here!\"    Winona turned crimson as Margaret pinned the daisy badge on to her  blouse.    \"I--I've been only too proud to do what I can!\" she blurted out. \"Thanks  most _awfully_!\"          CHAPTER X    A Scare      The Spring Term came to a close with a very fair number of hockey  successes to be placed to the credit of the Seaton High School. Compared  with last year's record it was indeed a great improvement, and Kirsty  felt that though they had not yet established a games reputation, they  at any rate showed good promise of future achievements. She hoped to do  much in the cricket and tennis season, though she certainly acknowledged  there was much to be done. The cricket so far had been such a  half-hearted business that she doubted the advisability of making any  fixtures.    \"I believe we'd just better train up for all we're worth,\" she said at  the committee meeting. \"It'll take ages to lick an eleven into shape.  What we want is to get a cricket atmosphere into the school. You can't  develop these things all in a few weeks. You've got to catch your kids  young and teach them, before you get a school with a reputation. I feel  with all the games that we're simply building foundations at present at  the Seaton High. This term especially is spade-work. I'll do all I can  to get things going, but it will be the Games Captain who comes after me  who'll reap the reward.\"    \"Can't you stay on another year?\" suggested Patricia.    \"Wish I could for some things, but it's impossible. No, I'll do my bit  this term, and then hand over the job to my successor. As I said before,  what we want now is a good start.\"    Kirsty was a capital organizer. She soon recognized a girl's capacities,  and she had a knack of inspiring enthusiasm even in apparent slackers.  She worked thoroughly hard herself, and insisted that everybody else did  the same. Her motto for the term was the athletic"]]]
