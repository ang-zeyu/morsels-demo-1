Such is My plight, wert thou to ponder it in thine heart. Let not,  however, thy soul grieve over that which God hath rained down upon Us.  Merge thy will in His pleasure, for We have, at no time, desired anything  whatsoever except His Will, and have welcomed each one of His irrevocable  decrees. Let thine heart be patient, and be thou not dismayed. Follow not  in the way of them that are sorely agitated.            LXIII: O THOU WHOSE FACE IS TURNED TOWARDS ME!...      O thou whose face is turned towards Me! As soon as thine eyes behold from  afar My native city (Tihran), stand thou and say: I am come to thee out of  the Prison, O Land of Ta, with tidings from God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting. I announce unto thee, O mother of the world and fountain  of light unto all its peoples, the tender mercies of thy Lord, and greet  thee in the name of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, the Knower of things  unseen. I testify that within thee He Who is the Hidden Name was revealed,  and the Unseen Treasure uncovered. Through thee the secret of all things,  be they of the past or of the future, hath been unfolded.    O Land of Ta! He Who is the Lord of Names remembereth thee in His glorious  station. Thou wert the Day Spring of the Cause of God, the fountain of His  Revelation, the manifestation of His Most Great Name--a Name that hath  caused the hearts and souls of men to tremble. How vast the number of  those men and women, those victims of tyranny, that have, within thy  walls, laid down their lives in the path of God, and been buried beneath  thy dust with such cruelty as to cause every honored servant of God to  bemoan their plight.            LXIV: IT IS OUR WISH TO REMEMBER THE ABODE OF...      It is Our wish to remember the Abode of supreme blissfulness (Tihran), the  holy and shining city--the city wherein the fragrance of the Well-Beloved  hath been shed, wherein His signs have been diffused, wherein the  evidences of His glory have been revealed, wherein His standards have been  raised, wherein His tabernacle hath been pitched, wherein each of His wise  decrees hath been unfolded.    It is the city in which the sweet savors of reunion have breathed, which  have caused the sincere lovers of God to draw nigh unto Him, and to gain  access to the Habitation of holiness and beauty. Happy is the wayfarer  that directeth his steps towards this city, that gaineth admittance into  it, and quaffeth the wine of reunion, through the outpouring grace of his  Lord, the Gracious, the All-Praised.    I am come to thee, O land of the heart's desire, with tidings from God,  and announce to thee His gracious favor and mercy, and greet and magnify  thee in His name. He, in truth, is of immense bounteousness and goodness.  Blessed be the man that turneth his face towards thee, that perceiveth  from thee the fragrance of God's Presence, the Lord of all worlds. His  glory be on thee, and the brightness of His light envelop thee, inasmuch  as God hath made thee a paradise unto His servants, and proclaimed thee to  be the blest and sacred land of which He, Himself, hath made mention in  the Books which His Prophets and Messengers have revealed.    Through thee, O land of resplendent glory, the ensign, \"There is none  other God but Him,\" hath been unfurled, and the standard, \"Verily I am the  Truth, the Knower of things unseen,\" been hoisted. It behoveth every one  that visiteth thee to glory in thee and in them that inhabit thee, that  have branched from My Tree, who are the leaves thereof, who are the signs  of My glory, who follow Me and are My lovers, and who, with the most  mighty determination, have turned their faces in the direction of My  glorious station.            LXV: CALL THOU TO REMEMBRANCE THINE ARRIVAL IN...      Call Thou to remembrance Thine arrival in the City (Constantinople), how  the Ministers of the Sultan thought Thee to be unacquainted with their  laws and regulations, and believed Thee to be one of the ignorant. Say:  Yes, by My Lord! I am ignorant of all things except what God hath, through  His bountiful favor, been pleased to teach Me. To this We assuredly  testify, and unhesitatingly confess it.    Say: If the laws and regulations to which ye cleave be of your own making,  We will, in no wise, follow them. Thus have I been instructed by Him Who  is the All-Wise, the All-Informed. Such hath been My way in the past, and  such will it remain in the future, through the power of God and His might.  This, indeed, is the true and right way. If they be ordained by God, bring  forth, then, your proofs, if ye be of them that speak the truth. Say: We  have written down in a Book which leaveth not unrecorded the work of any  man, however insignificant, all that they have imputed to Thee, and all  that they have done unto Thee.    Say: It behoveth you, O Ministers of State, to keep the precepts of God,  and to forsake your own laws and regulations, and to be of them who are  guided aright. Better is this for you than all ye possess, did ye but know  it. If ye transgress the commandment of God, not one jot or one tittle of  all your works shall be acceptable in His sight. Ye shall, erelong,  discover the consequences of that which ye shall have done in this vain  life, and shall be repaid for them. This, verily, is the truth, the  undoubted truth.    How great the number of those who, in bygone ages, have committed the  things ye have committed, and who, though superior to you in rank, have,  in the end, returned unto dust, and been consigned to their inevitable  doom! Would that ye might ponder the Cause of God in your hearts! Ye shall  follow in their wake, and shall be made to enter a habitation wherein none  shall be found to befriend or help you. Ye shall, of a truth, be asked of  your doings, shall be called to account for your failure in duty with  regard to the Cause of God, and for having disdainfully rejected His loved  ones who, with manifest sincerity, have come unto you.    It is ye who have taken counsel together regarding them, ye that have  preferred to follow the promptings of your own desires, and forsaken the  commandment of God, the Help in Peril, the Almighty.    Say: What! Cleave ye to your own devices, and cast behind your backs the  precepts of God? Ye, indeed, have wronged your own selves and others.  Would that ye could perceive it! Say: If your rules and principles be  founded on justice, why is it, then, that ye follow those which accord  with your corrupt inclinations and reject such as conflict with your  desires? By what right claim ye, then, to judge fairly between men? Are  your rules and principles such as to justify your persecution of Him Who,  at your bidding, hath presented Himself before you, your rejection of Him,  and your infliction on Him every day of grievous injury? Hath He ever,  though it be for one short moment, disobeyed you? All the inhabitants of  'Iraq, and beyond them every discerning observer, will bear witness to the  truth of My words.    Be fair in your judgment, O ye Ministers of State! What is it that We have  committed that could justify Our banishment? What is the offense that hath  warranted Our expulsion? It is We Who have sought you, and yet, behold how  ye refused to receive Us! By God! This is a sore injustice that ye have  perpetrated--an injustice with which no earthly injustice can measure. To  this the Almighty is Himself a witness....    Know ye that the world and its vanities and its embellishments shall pass  away. Nothing will endure except God's Kingdom which pertaineth to none  but Him, the Sovereign Lord of all, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious,  the Almighty. The days of your life shall roll away, and all the things  with which ye are occupied and of which ye boast yourselves shall perish,  and ye shall, most certainly, be summoned by a company of His angels to  appear at the spot where the limbs of the entire creation shall be made to  tremble, and the flesh of every oppressor to creep. Ye shall be asked of  the things your hands have wrought in this, your vain life, and shall be  repaid for your doings. This is the day that shall inevitably come upon  you, the hour that none can put back. To this the Tongue of Him that  speaketh the truth and is the Knower of all things hath testified.            LXVI: FEAR GOD, YE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY (CONSTANTINOPLE),...      Fear God, ye inhabitants of the City (Constantinople), and sow not the  seeds of dissension amongst men. Walk not in the paths of the Evil One.  Walk ye, during the few remaining days of your life, in the ways of the  one true God. Your days shall pass away as have the days of them who were  before you. To dust shall ye return, even as your fathers of old did  return.    Know ye that I am afraid of none except God. In none but Him have I placed  My trust; to none will I cleave but Him, and wish for naught except the  thing He hath wished for Me. This, indeed, is My heart's desire, did ye  but know it. I have offered up My soul and My body as a sacrifice for God,  the Lord of all worlds. Whoso hath known God shall know none but Him, and  he that feareth God shall be afraid of no one except Him, though the  powers of the whole earth rise up and be arrayed against him. I speak  naught except at His bidding, and follow not, through the power of God and  His might, except His truth. He, verily, shall recompense the truthful.    Narrate, O Servant, the things Thou didst behold at the time of Thine  arrival in the City, that Thy testimony may endure amongst men, and serve  as a warning unto them that believe. We found, upon Our arrival in the  City, its governors and elders as children gathered about and disporting  themselves with clay. We perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire  from Us the truths which God hath taught Us, nor ripe for Our wondrous  words of wisdom.

When her master returned and saw the havoc  made among his goods he fetched the parrot a blow that knocked out all  her head feathers, and from that day she sulked on her perch. The  oilman, missing the prattle of his favourite, began to shower his alms  on every passing beggar, in hopes that some one would induce the parrot  to speak again. At length a bald-headed mendicant came to the shop one  day, upon seeing whom, the parrot, breaking her long silence, cried out:  \"Poor fellow! poor fellow! hast thou, too, upset some oil-jar?\"[39]       [39] This tale is found in the early Italian novelists,          slightly varied, and it was doubtless introduced by          Venetian merchants from the Levant: A parrot belonging          to Count Fiesco was discovered one day stealing some          roast meat from the kitchen. The enraged cook,          overtaking him, threw a kettle of boiling water at him,          which completely scalded all the feathers from his head,          and left the poor bird with a bare poll. Some time          afterwards, as Count Fiesco was engaged in conversation          with an abbot, the parrot, observing the shaven crown of          his reverence, hopped up to him and said: \"What! do          _you_ like roast meat too?\"            In another form the story is orally current in the North          of England. Dr. Fryer tells it to this effect, in his          charming _English Fairy Tales from the North Country_: A          grocer kept a parrot that used to cry out to the          customers that the sugar was sanded and the butter mixed          with lard. For this the bird had her neck wrung and was          thrown upon an ash-heap; but reviving and seeing a dead          cat beside her she cried: \"Poor Puss! have you, too,          suffered for telling the truth?\"            There is yet another variant of this droll tale, which          has been popular for generations throughout England, and          was quite recently reproduced in an American journal as          a genuine \"nigger\" story: In olden times there was a          roguish baker who made many of his loaves less than the          regulation weight, and one day, on observing the          government inspector coming along the street, he          concealed the light loaves in a closet. The inspector          having found the bread on the counter of the proper          weight, was about to leave, when a parrot, which the          baker kept in his shop, cried out: \"Light bread in the          closet!\" This caused a search to be made, and the baker          was heavily fined. Full of fury, the baker seized the          parrot, wrung its neck, and threw it in his back yard,          near the carcase of a pig that had died of the measles.          The parrot, coming to itself again, observed the dead          porker and inquired in a tone of sympathy: \"O poor          piggy, didst thou, too, tell about light bread in the          closet?\"    Somewhat more credible is the tale of the man who taught a parrot to  say, \"What doubt is there of this?\" (_dur in cheh shuk_) and took it to  market for sale, fixing the price at a hundred rupis. A Moghul asked the  bird: \"Are you really worth a hundred rupis?\" to which the bird answered  very readily: \"What doubt is there of this?\" Delighted with the apt  reply, he bought the parrot and took it home; but he soon found that,  whatever he might say, the bird always made the same answer, so he  repented his purchase and exclaimed: \"I was certainly a great fool to  buy this bird!\" The parrot said: \"What doubt is there of this?\" The  Moghul smiled, and gave the bird her liberty.           *       *       *       *       *    Sir John Malcolm cites a good example of the ready wit of the citizens  of Isfahan, in his entertaining _Sketches of Persia_, as follows: When  the celebrated Haji Ibrahim was prime minister of Persia [some sixty  years since], his brother was governor of Isfahan, while other members  of his family held several of the first offices of the kingdom. A  shop-keeper one day went to the governor to represent that he was unable  to pay certain taxes. \"You must pay them,\" replied the governor, \"or  leave the city.\" \"Where can I go to?\" asked the Isfahani. \"To Shiraz or  Kashan.\" \"Your nephew rules in one city and your brother in the other.\"  \"Go to the Shah, and complain if you like.\" \"Your brother the Haji is  prime minister.\" \"Then go to Satan,\" said the enraged governor. \"Haji  Merhum, your father, the pious pilgrim, is dead,\" rejoined the undaunted  Isfahani. \"My friend,\" said the governor, bursting into laughter, \"I  will pay your taxes, even myself, since you declare that my family keep  you from all redress, both in this world and the next.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Hebrew Rabbis who compiled the Talmud were, some of them, witty as  well as wise--indeed I have always held that wisdom and wit are cousins  german, if not full brothers--and our specimens of Oriental Wit and  Humour may be fittingly concluded with a few Jewish jests from a scarce  little book, entitled, _Hebrew Tales_, by Hyman Hurwitz: An Athenian,  walking about in the streets of Jerusalem one day, called to a little  Hebrew boy, and, giving him a _pruta_ (a small coin of less value than a  farthing), said: \"Here is a pruta, my lad, bring me something for it, of  which I may eat enough, leave some for my host, and carry some home to  my family.\" The boy went, and presently returned with a quantity of  salt, which he handed to the jester. \"Salt!\" he exclaimed, \"I did not  ask thee to buy me salt.\" \"True,\" said the urchin; \"but didst thou not  tell me to bring thee something of which thou mightest eat, leave, and  take home? Of this salt there is surely enough for all three  purposes.\"[40]       [40] In the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles' _Folk-Tales of Kashmir_ a          merchant gives his stupid son a small coin with which he          is to purchase something to eat, something to drink,          something to gnaw, something to sow in the garden, and          some food for the cow. A clever young girl advises him          to buy a water-melon, which would answer all the          purposes required.--P. 145.    Another Athenian desired a boy to buy him some cheese and eggs. Having  done so, \"Now, my lad,\" said the stranger, \"tell me which of these  cheese were made of the milk of white goats and which of black goats?\"  The little Hebrew answered: \"Since thou art older than I, and more  experienced, first do thou tell me which of these eggs came from white  and which from black hens.\"    Once more did a Hebrew urchin prove his superiority in wit over an  Athenian: \"Here, boy,\" said he, \"here is some money; bring us some figs  and grapes.\" The lad went and bought the fruit, kept half of it for  himself, and gave the other half to the Athenian. \"How!\" cried the man,  \"is it the custom of this city for a messenger to take half of what he  is sent to purchase?\" \"No,\" replied the boy; \"but it is our custom to  speak what we mean, and to do what we are desired.\" \"Well, then, I did  not desire thee to take half of the fruit.\" \"Why, what else could you  mean,\" rejoined the little casuist, \"by saying, 'Bring _us_?' Does not  that word include the hearer as well as the speaker?\" The stranger, not  knowing how to answer such reasoning, smiled and went his way, leaving  the shrewd lad to eat his share of the fruit in peace.    \"There is no rule without some exception,\" as the following tale  demonstrates: Rabbi Eliezar, who was as much distinguished by his  greatness of mind as by the extraordinary size of his body, once paid a  friendly visit to Rabbi Simon. The learned Simon received him most  cordially, and filling a cup with wine handed it to him. Eliezar took it  and drank it off at a draught. Another was poured out--it shared the  same fate. \"Brother Eliezar,\" said Simon, jestingly, \"rememberest thou  not what the wise men have said on this subject?\" \"I well remember,\"  replied his corpulent friend, \"the saying of our instructors, that  people ought not to take a cup at one draught. But the wise men have not  so defined their rule as to admit of no exception; and in this instance  there are not less than three--the _cup_ is small, the _receiver_ is  large, and your WINE, brother Simon, is DELICIOUS!\"          TALES OF A PARROT.          I    GENERAL PLAN OF EASTERN ROMANCES--THE \"TUTI NAMA,\" OR PARROT-BOOK--THE  FRAME-STORY--TALES: THE STOLEN IMAGES--THE WOMAN CARVED OUT OF WOOD--THE  MAN WHOSE MARE WAS KICKED BY A MERCHANT'S HORSE.      Oriental romances are usually constructed on the plan of a number of  tales connected by a general or leading story running throughout, like  the slender thread that holds a necklace of pearls together--a familiar  example of which is the _Book of the Thousand and One Nights_, commonly  known amongst us under the title of _Arabian Nights Entertainments_. In  some the subordinate tales are represented as being told by one or more  individuals to serve a particular object, by the moral, or warning,  which they are supposed to convey; as in the case of the _Book of  Sindibad_, in which a prince is falsely accused by one of his father's  ladies, and defended by the king's seven vazirs, or counsellors, who  each in turn relate to the king two stories, the purport of which being  to warn him to put no faith in the accusations of women, to which the  lady replies by stories representing the wickedness and perfidy of men;  and that of the _Bakhtyar Nama_, in which a youth, falsely accused of  having violated the royal harem, obtains for himself a respite from  death during ten days by relating to the king each day a story designed  to caution him against precipitation in matters of"]]]
