From the instant that my eyes were drawn to the table and to the man  who sat there, neither the incredible extent of the room, nor the  nightmare fashion of its mural decorations, could reclaim my attention.  I had eyes only for him.    For it was Dr. Fu-Manchu!    Something of the delirium which had seemed to fill my veins with fire,  to people the walls with dragons, and to plunge me knee-deep in the  carpet, left me.  Those dreadful, filmed green eyes acted somewhat like  a cold douche.  I knew, without removing my gaze from the still face,  that the walls no longer lived, but were merely draped in exquisite  Chinese dragon tapestry.  The rich carpet beneath my feet ceased to be  as a jungle and became a normal carpet--extraordinarily rich, but  merely a carpet.  But the sense of vastness nevertheless remained, with  the uncomfortable knowledge that the things upon the table and  overflowing about it were all, or nearly all, of a fashion strange to  me.    Then, and almost instantaneously, the comparative sanity which I had  temporarily experienced began to slip from me again; for the smoke  faintly penciled through the air--from the burning perfume on the  table--grew in volume, thickened, and wafted towards me in a cloud of  gray horror.  It enveloped me, clammily.  Dimly, through its oily  wreaths, I saw the immobile yellow face of Fu-Manchu. And my stupefied  brain acclaimed him a sorcerer, against whom unwittingly we had pitted  our poor human wits.  The green eyes showed filmy through the fog.  An  intense pain shot through my lower limbs, and, catching my breath, I  looked down.  As I did so, the points of the red slippers which I  dreamed that I wore increased in length, curled sinuously upward,  twined about my throat and choked the breath from my body!    Came an interval, and then a dawning like consciousness; but it was a  false consciousness, since it brought with it the idea that my head lay  softly pillowed and that a woman's hand caressed my throbbing forehead.  Confusedly, as though in the remote past, I recalled a kiss--and the  recollection thrilled me strangely.  Dreamily content I lay, and a  voice stole to my ears:    \"They are killing him!  they are killing him!  Oh!  do you not  understand?\" In my dazed condition, I thought that it was I who had  died, and that this musical girl-voice was communicating to me the fact  of my own dissolution.    But I was conscious of no interest in the matter.    For hours and hours, I thought, that soothing hand caressed me.  I  never once raised my heavy lids, until there came a resounding crash  that seemed to set my very bones vibrating--a metallic, jangling crash,  as the fall of heavy chains.  I thought that, then, I half opened my  eyes, and that in the dimness I had a fleeting glimpse of a figure clad  in gossamer silk, with arms covered with barbaric bangles and slim  ankles surrounded by gold bands.  The girl was gone, even as I told  myself that she was an houri, and that I, though a Christian, had been  consigned by some error to the paradise of Mohammed.    Then--a complete blank.      My head throbbed madly; my brain seemed to be clogged--inert; and  though my first, feeble movement was followed by the rattle of a chain,  some moments more elapsed ere I realized that the chain was fastened to  a steel collar--that the steel collar was clasped about my neck.    I moaned weakly.    \"Smith!\" I muttered, \"Where are you?  Smith!\"    On to my knees I struggled, and the pain on the top of my skull grew  all but insupportable.  It was coming back to me now; how Nayland Smith  and I had started for the hotel to warn Graham Guthrie; how, as we  passed up the steps from the Embankment and into Essex Street, we saw  the big motor standing before the door of one of the offices.  I could  recall coming up level with the car--a modern limousine; but my mind  retained no impression of our having passed it--only a vague memory of  a rush of footsteps--a blow.  Then, my vision of the hall of dragons,  and now this real awakening to a worse reality.    Groping in the darkness, my hands touched a body that lay close beside  me.  My fingers sought and found the throat, sought and found the steel  collar about it.    \"Smith,\" I groaned; and I shook the still form.  \"Smith, old man--speak  to me!  Smith!\"    Could he be dead?  Was this the end of his gallant fight with Dr.  Fu-Manchu and the murder group?  If so, what did the future hold for  me--what had I to face?    He stirred beneath my trembling hands.    \"Thank God!\"  I muttered, and I cannot deny that my joy was tainted  with selfishness.  For, waking in that impenetrable darkness, and yet  obsessed with the dream I had dreamed, I had known what fear meant, at  the realization that alone, chained, I must face the dreadful Chinese  doctor in the flesh.  Smith began incoherent mutterings.    \"Sand-bagged! . . . Look out, Petrie! . . . He has us at last! . . .  Oh, Heavens!\" . . . He struggled on to his knees, clutching at my hand.    \"All right, old man,\" I said.  \"We are both alive!  So let's be  thankful.\"    A moment's silence, a groan, then:    \"Petrie, I have dragged you into this.  God forgive me--\"    \"Dry up, Smith,\" I said slowly.  \"I'm not a child.  There is no  question of being dragged into the matter.  I'm here; and if I can be  of any use, I'm glad I am here!\"    He grasped my hand.    \"There were two Chinese, in European clothes--lord, how my head  throbs!--in that office door.  They sand-bagged us, Petrie--think of  it!--in broad daylight, within hail of the Strand!  We were rushed into  the car--and it was all over, before--\" His voice grew faint.  \"God!  they gave me an awful knock!\"    \"Why have we been spared, Smith?  Do you think he is saving us for--\"    \"Don't, Petrie!  If you had been in China, if you had seen what I have  seen--\"    Footsteps sounded on the flagged passage.  A blade of light crept  across the floor towards us.  My brain was growing clearer.  The place  had a damp, earthen smell.  It was slimy--some noisome cellar.  A door  was thrown open and a man entered, carrying a lantern.  Its light  showed my surmise to be accurate, showed the slime-coated walls of a  dungeon some fifteen feet square--shone upon the long yellow robe of  the man who stood watching us, upon the malignant, intellectual  countenance.    It was Dr. Fu-Manchu.    At last they were face to face--the head of the great Yellow Movement,  and the man who fought on behalf of the entire white race.  How can I  paint the individual who now stood before us--perhaps the greatest  genius of modern times?    Of him it had been fitly said that he had a brow like Shakespeare and a  face like Satan.  Something serpentine, hypnotic, was in his very  presence.  Smith drew one sharp breath, and was silent.  Together,  chained to the wall, two mediaeval captives, living mockeries of our  boasted modern security, we crouched before Dr. Fu-Manchu.    He came forward with an indescribable gait, cat-like yet awkward,  carrying his high shoulders almost hunched.  He placed the lantern in a  niche in the wall, never turning away the reptilian gaze of those eyes  which must haunt my dreams forever.  They possessed a viridescence  which hitherto I had supposed possible only in the eye of the cat--and  the film intermittently clouded their brightness--but I can speak of  them no more.    I had never supposed, prior to meeting Dr. Fu-Manchu, that so intense a  force of malignancy could radiate--from any human being.  He spoke.  His English was perfect, though at times his words were oddly chosen;  his delivery alternately was guttural and sibilant.    \"Mr. Smith and Dr. Petrie, your interference with my plans has gone too  far.  I have seriously turned my attention to you.\"    He displayed his teeth, small and evenly separated, but discolored in a  way that was familiar to me.  I studied his eyes with a new  professional interest, which even the extremity of our danger could not  wholly banish.  Their greenness seemed to be of the iris; the pupil was  oddly contracted--a pin-point.    Smith leaned his back against the wall with assumed indifference.    \"You have presumed,\" continued Fu-Manchu, \"to meddle with a  world-change. Poor spiders--caught in the wheels of the inevitable!  You have linked my name with the futility of the Young China  Movement--the name of Fu-Manchu!  Mr. Smith, you are an incompetent  meddler--I despise you!  Dr. Petrie, you are a fool--I am sorry for  you!\"    He rested one bony hand on his hip, narrowing the long eyes as he  looked down on us.  The purposeful cruelty of the man was inherent; it  was entirely untheatrical.  Still Smith remained silent.    \"So I am determined to remove you from the scene of your blunders!\"  added Fu-Manchu.    \"Opium will very shortly do the same for you!\" I rapped at him savagely.    Without emotion he turned the narrowed eyes upon me.    \"That is a matter of opinion, Doctor,\" he said.  \"You may have lacked  the opportunities which have been mine for studying that subject--and  in any event I shall not be privileged to enjoy your advice in the  future.\"    \"You will not long outlive me,\" I replied.  \"And our deaths will not  profit you, incidentally; because--\" Smith's foot touched mine.    \"Because?\" inquired Fu-Manchu softly.    \"Ah!  Mr. Smith is so prudent!  He is thinking that I have FILES!\" He  pronounced the word in a way that made me shudder.  \"Mr. Smith has seen  a WIRE JACKET!  Have you ever seen a wire jacket?  As a surgeon its  functions would interest you!\"    I stifled a cry that rose to my lips; for, with a shrill whistling  sound, a small shape came bounding into the dimly lit vault, then shot  upward.  A marmoset landed on the shoulder of Dr. Fu-Manchu and peered  grotesquely into the dreadful yellow face.  The Doctor raised his bony  hand and fondled the little creature, crooning to it.

The whole clothing of the working-class, even assuming it to be in good  condition, is little adapted to the climate.  The damp air of England,  with its sudden changes of temperature, more calculated than any other to  give rise to colds, obliges almost the whole middle-class to wear flannel  next the skin, about the body, and flannel scarfs and shirts are in  almost universal use.  Not only is the working-class deprived of this  precaution, it is scarcely ever in a position to use a thread of woollen  clothing; and the heavy cotton goods, though thicker, stiffer, and  heavier than woollen clothes, afford much less protection against cold  and wet, remain damp much longer because of their thickness and the  nature of the stuff, and have nothing of the compact density of fulled  woollen cloths.  And, if a working-man once buys himself a woollen coat  for Sunday, he must get it from one of the cheap shops where he finds  bad, so-called \"Devil's-dust\" cloth, manufactured for sale and not for  use, and liable to tear or grow threadbare in a fortnight, or he must buy  of an old clothes'-dealer a half-worn coat which has seen its best days,  and lasts but a few weeks.  Moreover, the working-man's clothing is, in  most cases, in bad condition, and there is the oft-recurring necessity  for placing the best pieces in the pawnbroker's shop.  But among very  large numbers, especially among the Irish, the prevailing clothing  consists of perfect rags often beyond all mending, or so patched that the  original colour can no longer be detected.  Yet the English and Anglo-  Irish go on patching, and have carried this art to a remarkable pitch,  putting wool or bagging on fustian, or the reverse--it's all the same to  them.  But the true, transplanted Irish hardly ever patch except in the  extremest necessity, when the garment would otherwise fall apart.  Ordinarily the rags of the shirt protrude through the rents in the coat  or trousers.  They wear, as Thomas Carlyle says,--{67}       \"A suit of tatters, the getting on or off which is said to be a     difficult operation, transacted only in festivals and the high tides     of the calendar.\"    The Irish have introduced, too, the custom previously unknown in England,  of going barefoot.  In every manufacturing town there is now to be seen a  multitude of people, especially women and children, going about barefoot,  and their example is gradually being adopted by the poorer English.    As with clothing, so with food.  The workers get what is too bad for the  property-holding class.  In the great towns of England everything may be  had of the best, but it costs money; and the workman, who must keep house  on a couple of pence, cannot afford much expense.  Moreover, he usually  receives his wages on Saturday evening, for, although a beginning has  been made in the payment of wages on Friday, this excellent arrangement  is by no means universal; and so he comes to market at five or even seven  o'clock, while the buyers of the middle-class have had the first choice  during the morning, when the market teems with the best of everything.  But when the workers reach it, the best has vanished, and, if it was  still there, they would probably not be able to buy it.  The potatoes  which the workers buy are usually poor, the vegetables wilted, the cheese  old and of poor quality, the bacon rancid, the meat lean, tough, taken  from old, often diseased, cattle, or such as have died a natural death,  and not fresh even then, often half decayed.  The sellers are usually  small hucksters who buy up inferior goods, and can sell them cheaply by  reason of their badness.  The poorest workers are forced to use still  another device to get together the things they need with their few pence.  As nothing can be sold on Sunday, and all shops must be closed at twelve  o'clock on Saturday night, such things as would not keep until Monday are  sold at any price between ten o'clock and midnight.  But nine-tenths of  what is sold at ten o'clock is past using by Sunday morning, yet these  are precisely the provisions which make up the Sunday dinner of the  poorest class.  The meat which the workers buy is very often past using;  but having bought it, they must eat it.  On the 6th of January, 1844 (if  I am not greatly mistaken), a court leet was held in Manchester, when  eleven meat-sellers were fined for having sold tainted meat.  Each of  them had a whole ox or pig, or several sheep, or from fifty to sixty  pounds of meat, which were all confiscated in a tainted condition.  In  one case, sixty-four stuffed Christmas geese were seized which had proved  unsaleable in Liverpool, and had been forwarded to Manchester, where they  were brought to market foul and rotten.  All the particulars, with names  and fines, were published at the time in the _Manchester Guardian_.  In  the six weeks, from July 1st to August 14th, the same sheet reported  three similar cases.  According to the _Guardian_ for August 3rd, a pig,  weighing 200 pounds, which had been found dead and decayed, was cut up  and exposed for sale by a butcher at Heywood, and was then seized.  According to the number for July 31st, two butchers at Wigan, of whom one  had previously been convicted of the same offence, were fined 2 and 4  pounds respectively, for exposing tainted meat for sale; and, according  to the number for August 10th, twenty-six tainted hams seized at a  dealer's in Bolton, were publicly burnt, and the dealer fined twenty  shillings.  But these are by no means all the cases; they do not even  form a fair average for a period of six weeks, according to which to form  an average for the year.  There are often seasons in which every number  of the semi-weekly _Guardian_ mentions a similar case found in Manchester  or its vicinity.  And when one reflects upon the many cases which must  escape detection in the extensive markets that stretch along the front of  every main street, under the slender supervision of the market  inspectors--and how else can one explain the boldness with which whole  animals are exposed for sale?--when one considers how great the  temptation must be, in view of the incomprehensibly small fines mentioned  in the foregoing cases; when one reflects what condition a piece of meat  must have reached to be seized by the inspectors, it is impossible to  believe that the workers obtain good and nourishing meat as a usual  thing.  But they are victimised in yet another way by the money-greed of  the middle-class.  Dealers and manufacturers adulterate all kinds of  provisions in an atrocious manner, and without the slightest regard to  the health of the consumers.  We have heard the _Manchester Guardian_  upon this subject, let us hear another organ of the middle-class--I  delight in the testimony of my opponents--let us hear the _Liverpool  Mercury_: \"Salted butter is sold for fresh, the lumps being covered with  a coating of fresh butter, or a pound of fresh being laid on top to  taste, while the salted article is sold after this test, or the whole  mass is washed and then sold as fresh.  With sugar, pounded rice and  other cheap adulterating materials are mixed, and the whole sold at full  price.  The refuse of soap-boiling establishments also is mixed with  other things and sold as sugar.  Chicory and other cheap stuff is mixed  with ground coffee, and artificial coffee beans with the unground  article.  Cocoa is often adulterated with fine brown earth, treated with  fat to render it more easily mistakable for real cocoa.  Tea is mixed  with the leaves of the sloe and with other refuse, or dry tea-leaves are  roasted on hot copper plates, so returning to the proper colour and being  sold as fresh.  Pepper is mixed with pounded nutshells; port wine is  manufactured outright (out of alcohol, dye-stuffs, etc.), while it is  notorious that more of it is consumed in England alone than is grown in  Portugal; and tobacco is mixed with disgusting substances of all sorts  and in all possible forms in which the article is produced.\"  I can add  that several of the most respected tobacco dealers in Manchester  announced publicly last summer, that, by reason of the universal  adulteration of tobacco, no firm could carry on business without  adulteration, and that no cigar costing less than threepence is made  wholly from tobacco.  These frauds are naturally not restricted to  articles of food, though I could mention a dozen more, the villainy of  mixing gypsum or chalk with flour among them.  Fraud is practiced in the  sale of articles of every sort: flannel, stockings, etc., are stretched,  and shrink after the first washing; narrow cloth is sold as being from  one and a half to three inches broader than it actually is; stoneware is  so thinly glazed that the glazing is good for nothing, and cracks at  once, and a hundred other rascalities, _tout comme chez nous_.  But the  lion's share of the evil results of these frauds falls to the workers.  The rich are less deceived, because they can pay the high prices of the  large shops which have a reputation to lose, and would injure themselves  more than their customers if they kept poor or adulterated wares; the  rich are spoiled, too, by habitual good eating, and detect adulteration  more easily with their sensitive palates.  But the poor, the  working-people, to whom a couple of farthings are important, who must buy  many things with little money, who cannot afford to inquire too closely  into the quality of their purchases, and cannot do so in any case because  they have had no opportunity of cultivating their taste--to their share  fall all the adulterated, poisoned provisions.  They must deal with the  small retailers, must buy perhaps on credit, and these small retail  dealers who cannot sell even the same quality of goods so cheaply as the  largest retailers, because of their small capital and the large  proportional expenses of their"]]]
