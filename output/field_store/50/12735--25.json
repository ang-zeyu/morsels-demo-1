He has caused various  nations and divergent creeds to unite. He has declared that difference of  race and color is like the variegated beauty of flowers in a garden. If  you enter a garden, you will see yellow, white, blue, red flowers in  profusion and beauty--each radiant within itself and although different  from the others, lending its own charm to them. Racial difference in the  human kingdom is similar. If all the flowers in a garden were of the same  color, the effect would be monotonous and wearying to the eye.    Therefore, Baha'u'llah hath said that the various races of humankind lend  a composite harmony and beauty of color to the whole. Let all associate,  therefore, in this great human garden even as flowers grow and blend  together side by side without discord or disagreement between them.          30 April 1912  Talk at Fourth Annual Conference of the National Association  for the Advancement of Colored People  Handel Hall, Chicago, Illinois      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    According to the words of the Old Testament God has said, \"Let us make man  in our image, after our likeness.\" This indicates that man is of the image  and likeness of God--that is to say, the perfections of God, the divine  virtues, are reflected or revealed in the human reality. Just as the light  and effulgence of the sun when cast upon a polished mirror are reflected  fully, gloriously, so, likewise, the qualities and attributes of Divinity  are radiated from the depths of a pure human heart. This is an evidence  that man is the most noble of God's creatures.    Each kingdom of creation is endowed with its necessary complement of  attributes and powers. The mineral possesses inherent virtues of its own  kingdom in the scale of existence. The vegetable possesses the qualities  of the mineral plus an augmentative virtue, or power of growth. The animal  is endowed with the virtues of both the mineral and vegetable plane plus  the power of intellect. The human kingdom is replete with the perfections  of all the kingdoms below it with the addition of powers peculiar to man  alone. Man is, therefore, superior to all the creatures below him, the  loftiest and most glorious being of creation. Man is the microcosm; and  the infinite universe, the macrocosm. The mysteries of the greater world,  or macrocosm, are expressed or revealed in the lesser world, the  microcosm. The tree, so to speak, is the greater world, and the seed in  its relation to the tree is the lesser world. But the whole of the great  tree is potentially latent and hidden in the little seed. When this seed  is planted and cultivated, the tree is revealed. Likewise, the greater  world, the macrocosm, is latent and miniatured in the lesser world, or  microcosm, of man. This constitutes the universality or perfection of  virtues potential in mankind. Therefore, it is said that man has been  created in the image and likeness of God.    Let us now discover more specifically how he is the image and likeness of  God and what is the standard or criterion by which he can be measured and  estimated. This standard can be no other than the divine virtues which are  revealed in him. Therefore, every man imbued with divine qualities, who  reflects heavenly moralities and perfections, who is the expression of  ideal and praiseworthy attributes, is, verily, in the image and likeness  of God. If a man possesses wealth, can we call him an image and likeness  of God? Or is human honor and notoriety the criterion of divine nearness?  Can we apply the test of racial color and say that man of a certain  hue--white, black, brown, yellow, red--is the true image of his Creator? We  must conclude that color is not the standard and estimate of judgment and  that it is of no importance, for color is accidental in nature. The spirit  and intelligence of man is essential, and that is the manifestation of  divine virtues, the merciful bestowals of God, the eternal life and  baptism through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, be it known that color or race  is of no importance. He who is the image and likeness of God, who is the  manifestation of the bestowals of God, is acceptable at the threshold of  God--whether his color be white, black or brown; it matters not. Man is not  man simply because of bodily attributes. The standard of divine measure  and judgment is his intelligence and spirit.    Therefore, let this be the only criterion and estimate, for this is the  image and likeness of God. A man's heart may be pure and white though his  outer skin be black; or his heart be dark and sinful though his racial  color is white. The character and purity of the heart is of all  importance. The heart illumined by the light of God is nearest and dearest  to God, and inasmuch as God has endowed man with such favor that he is  called the image of God, this is truly a supreme perfection of attainment,  a divine station which is not to be sacrificed by the mere accident of  color.          1 May 1912  Talk at Dedication of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar Grounds  Wilmette, Illinois      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    The power which has gathered you here today notwithstanding the cold and  windy weather is, indeed, mighty and wonderful. It is the power of God,  the divine favor of Baha'u'llah which has drawn you together. We praise  God that through His constraining love human souls are assembled and  associated in this way.    Thousands of Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kars, dawning points of praise and mention  of God for all religionists will be built in the East and in the West, but  this, being the first one erected in the Occident, has great importance.  In the future there will be many here and elsewhere--in Asia, Europe, even  in Africa, New Zealand and Australia--but this edifice in Chicago is of  especial significance. It has the same importance as the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in I_sh_qabad, Caucasus, Russia, the first one built  there. In Persia there are many; some are houses which have been utilized  for the purpose, others are homes entirely devoted to the divine Cause,  and in some places temporary structures have been erected. In all the  cities of Persia there are Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kars, but the great dawning  point was founded in I_sh_qabad. It possesses superlative importance  because it was the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar built. All the Baha'i  friends agreed and contributed their utmost assistance and effort. The  Afnan devoted his wealth, gave all he had to it. From such a mighty and  combined effort a beautiful edifice arose. Notwithstanding their  contributions to that building, they have assisted the fund here in  Chicago as well. The Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in I_sh_qabad is almost  completed. It is centrally located, nine avenues leading into it, nine  gardens, nine fountains; all the arrangement and construction is according  to the principle and proportion of the number nine. It is like a beautiful  bouquet. Imagine a very lofty, imposing edifice surrounded completely by  gardens of variegated flowers, with nine avenues leading through them,  nine fountains and pools of water. Such is its matchless, beautiful  design. Now they are building a hospital, a school for orphans, a home for  cripples, a hospice and a large dispensary. God willing, when it is fully  completed, it will be a paradise.    I hope the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in Chicago will be like this. Endeavor to  have the grounds circular in shape. If possible, adjust and exchange the  plots in order to make the dimensions and boundaries circular. The  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar cannot be triangular in shape. It must be in the  form of a circle.          2 May 1912  Talk at Hotel Plaza  Chicago, Illinois      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    In this Cause consultation is of vital importance, but spiritual  conference and not the mere voicing of personal views is intended. In  France I was present at a session of the senate, but the experience was  not impressive. Parliamentary procedure should have for its object the  attainment of the light of truth upon questions presented and not furnish  a battleground for opposition and self-opinion. Antagonism and  contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive to truth. In the  parliamentary meeting mentioned, altercation and useless quibbling were  frequent; the result, mostly confusion and turmoil; even in one instance a  physical encounter took place between two members. It was not consultation  but comedy.    The purpose is to emphasize the statement that consultation must have for  its object the investigation of truth. He who expresses an opinion should  not voice it as correct and right but set it forth as a contribution to  the consensus of opinion, for the light of reality becomes apparent when  two opinions coincide. A spark is produced when flint and steel come  together. Man should weigh his opinions with the utmost serenity, calmness  and composure. Before expressing his own views he should carefully  consider the views already advanced by others. If he finds that a  previously expressed opinion is more true and worthy, he should accept it  immediately and not willfully hold to an opinion of his own. By this  excellent method he endeavors to arrive at unity and truth. Opposition and  division are deplorable. It is better then to have the opinion of a wise,  sagacious man; otherwise, contradiction and altercation, in which varied  and divergent views are presented, will make it necessary for a judicial  body to render decision upon the question. Even a majority opinion or  consensus may be incorrect. A thousand people may hold to one view and be  mistaken, whereas one sagacious person may be right. Therefore, true  consultation is spiritual conference in the attitude and atmosphere of  love. Members must love each other in the spirit of fellowship in order  that good results may be forthcoming."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#19)"],[1,"'ABDU'L-BAHA INHALETH THE FRAGRANCE OF THE ...      Verily, 'Abdu'l-Baha inhaleth the fragrance of the love of God from every  meeting place where the Word of God is uttered and proofs and arguments  set forth that shed their rays across the world, and where they recount  the tribulations of 'Abdu'l-Baha at the evil hands of those who have  violated the Covenant of God.    O handmaid of the Lord! Speak thou no word of politics; thy task  concerneth the life of the soul, for this verily leadeth to man's joy in  the world of God. Except to speak well of them, make thou no mention of  the earth's kings, and the worldly governments thereof. Rather, confine  thine utterance to spreading the blissful tidings of the Kingdom of God,  and demonstrating the influence of the Word of God, and the holiness of  the Cause of God. Tell thou of abiding joy and spiritual delights, and  godlike qualities, and of how the Sun of Truth hath risen above the  earth's horizons: tell of the blowing of the spirit of life into the body  of the world.            54: YE HAVE WRITTEN AS TO THE MEETINGS OF THE FRIENDS, AND ...      Ye have written as to the meetings of the friends, and how filled they are  with peace and joy. Of course this is so; for wherever the spiritually  minded are gathered together, there in His beauty reigneth Baha'u'llah.  Thus it is certain that such reunions will yield boundless happiness and  peace.    Today it behoveth one and all to forgo the mention of all else, and to  disregard all things. Let their speaking, let their inner state be summed  up thus: 'Keep all my words of prayer and praise confined to one refrain;  make all my life but servitude to Thee.' That is, let them concentrate all  their thoughts, all their words, on teaching the Cause of God and  spreading the Faith of God, and inspiring all to characterize themselves  with the characteristics of God; on loving mankind; on being pure and holy  in all things, and spotless in their public and private life; on being  upright and detached, and fervent, and afire. All is to be yielded up,  save only the remembrance of God; all is to be dispraised, except His  praise. Today, to this melody of the Company on high, the world will leap  and dance: 'Glory be to my Lord, the All-Glorious!' But know ye this: save  for this song of God, no song will stir the world, and save for this  nightingale-cry of truth from the Garden of God, no melody will lure away  the heart. 'Whence cometh this Singer Who speaketh the Beloved's name?'            55: IT BEFITTETH THE FRIENDS TO HOLD A GATHERING, A ...      It befitteth the friends to hold a gathering, a meeting, where they shall  glorify God and fix their hearts upon Him, and read and recite the Holy  Writings of the Blessed Beauty--may my soul be the ransom of His lovers!  The lights of the All-Glorious Realm, the rays of the Supreme Horizon,  will be cast upon such bright assemblages, for these are none other than  the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kars, the Dawning-Points of God's Remembrance, which  must, at the direction of the Most Exalted Pen, be established in every  hamlet and city... These spiritual gatherings must be held with the utmost  purity and consecration, so that from the site itself, and its earth and  the air about it, one will inhale the fragrant breathings of the Holy  Spirit.            56: WHENSOEVER A COMPANY OF PEOPLE SHALL GATHER IN A ...      Whensoever a company of people shall gather in a meeting place, shall  engage in glorifying God, and shall speak with one another of the  mysteries of God, beyond any doubt the breathings of the Holy Spirit will  blow gently over them, and each shall receive a share thereof.            57: WE HEAR THAT THOU HAST IN MIND TO EMBELLISH THY ...      We hear that thou hast in mind to embellish thy house from time to time  with a meeting of Baha'is, where some among them will engage in glorifying  the All-Glorious Lord... Know that shouldst thou bring this about, that  house of earth will become a house of heaven, and that fabric of stone a  congress of the spirit.            58: THOU HAST ASKED ABOUT PLACES OF WORSHIP AND THE ...      Thou hast asked about places of worship and the underlying reason  therefor. The wisdom in raising up such buildings is that at a given hour,  the people should know it is time to meet, and all should gather together,  and, harmoniously attuned one to another, engage in prayer; with the  result that out of this coming together, unity and affection shall grow  and flourish in the human heart.            59: 'ABDU'L-BAHA HATH LONG CHERISHED THE DESIRE THAT A ...      'Abdu'l-Baha hath long cherished the desire that a Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar  be upraised in that region. Praised be God, thanks to the strenuous  efforts of the friends, in recent days the joyful news of this hath been  announced. This service is highly acceptable at the Threshold of God, for  the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar inspiriteth the lovers of God and delighteth  their hearts, and causeth them to become steadfast and firm.    This is a matter of the utmost significance. If the erection of the House  of Worship in a public place would arouse the hostility of evil-doers,  then the meeting must, in every locality, be held in some hidden place.  Even in every hamlet, a place must be set aside as the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and even though it be underground.    Now, praised be God, ye have succeeded in this. Engage ye in the  remembrance of God at dawn; rise ye up to praise and glorify Him. Blessed  are ye, and joy be yours, O ye the righteous, for having established the  Dawning-Point of the Praises of God. Verily I ask of the Lord that He make  you standards of salvation and banners of redemption, rippling high over  the valleys and hills.            60: ALTHOUGH TO OUTWARD SEEMING THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR ...      Although to outward seeming the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is a material  structure, yet it hath a spiritual effect. It forgeth bonds of unity from  heart to heart; it is a collective centre for men's souls. Every city in  which, during the days of the Manifestation, a temple was raised up, hath  created security and constancy and peace, for such buildings were given  over to the perpetual glorification of God, and only in the remembrance of  God can the heart find rest. Gracious God! The edifice of the House of  Worship hath a powerful influence on every phase of life. Experience hath,  in the east, clearly shown this to be a fact. Even if, in some small  village, a house was designated as the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, it produced  a marked effect; how much greater would be the impact of one especially  raised up.            61: O LORD, O THOU WHO DOST BLESS ALL THOSE WHO ...      O Lord, O Thou Who dost bless all those who stand firm in the Covenant by  enabling them, out of their love for the Light of the World, to expend  what they have as an offering to the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the dayspring  of Thy wide-spread rays and the proclaimer of Thine evidences, help Thou,  both in this world and the world to come, these righteous these upright  and pious ones to draw ever nearer to Thy sacred Threshold, and make  bright their faces with Thy dazzling splendours.    Verily art Thou the Generous, the Ever-Bestowing.            62: O MY WELL-BELOVED DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! ...      O my well-beloved daughter of the Kingdom! The letter thou hadst written  to Dr. Esslemont was forwarded by him to the Land of Desire [The Holy  Land]. I read it all through with the greatest attention. On the one hand,  I was deeply touched, for thou hadst sheared off those fair tresses of  thine with the shears of detachment from this world and of self-sacrifice  in the path of the Kingdom of God. And on the other, I was greatly  pleased, for that dearly-beloved daughter hath evinced so great a spirit  of self-sacrifice as to offer up so precious a part of her body in the  pathway of the Cause of God. Hadst thou sought my opinion, I would in no  wise have consented that thou shouldst shear off even a single thread of  thy comely and wavy locks; nay, I myself would have contributed in thy  name for the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. This deed of thine is, however, an  eloquent testimony to thy noble spirit of self-sacrifice. Thou hast,  verily, sacrificed thy life and great will be the spiritual results thou  shalt obtain. Rest thou confident that day by day thou shalt progress and  wax greater in firmness and in constancy. The bounties of Baha'u'llah  shall compass thee about and the joyful tidings from on high shall time  and again be imparted unto thee. And though it be thine hair that thou  hast sacrificed, yet thou shalt be filled with the Spirit, and though it  be this perishable member of thy body which thou hast laid down in the  path of God, yet thou shalt find the Divine Gift, shalt behold the  Celestial Beauty, obtain imperishable glory and attain unto everlasting  life.            63: O YE BLESSED SOULS! THE LETTER YE HAD WRITTEN TO ...      O ye blessed souls!(31) The letter ye had written to Rahmatu'llah hath  been perused. Many and various were the joyful tidings it conveyed,  namely, that through the power of faith and constancy in the Covenant,  numerous gatherings have been convened, and the loved ones are everywhere  astir and active.    'Abdu'l-Baha's ardent desire hath ever been that the soil of that hallowed  spot, which in the earliest days of the Cause hath been refreshed and made  verdant with the spring showers of grace, may so bloom and blossom as to  fill every heart with joy.    Praised be the Lord, the Cause of God hath been proclaimed and promoted  throughout the East and the West in such wise that no mind had ever  conceived that the sweet savours of the Lord would so rapidly perfume all  regions. This, verily, is only through the consummate bounties of the  ever-blessed Beauty, Whose grace and Whose triumphing power are time and  again abundantly received.    One of the wondrous"]]]
