But I shall  think you a boy no more. I know you better now.\"    \"But I am a boy,\" Francis said, \"and I don't want to be thought  anything else. In England we keep young longer than they do here, and a  boy of my age would not think of speaking to his elders, unless he was  first addressed.    \"What are you going to do with your prisoners, signor?\"    \"I shall take them direct to my house, and then go and report the  recovery of my daughters, and their capture. Officials will at once be  sent, with a gondola, to take them off to the prison. There can be no  question now as to the part Mocenigo has played in this business, and  no doubt he will be brought here a prisoner at once. Even his nearest  connections will not dare to defend conduct so outrageous, especially  when public indignation has been so excited.    \"You do not know, girls, what a stir has been caused in the city on  your account. If it had not been for the citizen guard, I believe the  Mocenigo Palace would have been burned down; and Ruggiero's connections  have scarcely dared to show their faces in the streets, since you have  been missing. You see, every father of a family felt personally  grieved, for if the nobles were permitted, with impunity, to carry off  the daughters of citizens, who could feel safe?    \"When this is all over I shall take you, for a time, back to our home  in Corfu. It is not good for girls to be the subject of public talk and  attention.\"    \"I shall be very glad, father,\" Giulia said. \"I love our home at Corfu,  with its gardens and flowers, far better than the palazzo here. The air  is always soft and balmy, while here it is so hot sometimes by day, and  so damp and foggy in the evening. I shall be glad to go back again.\"    \"And you, Maria?\"    \"I shall be very happy there, father, but I like Venice best.\"    \"You are getting to an age to enjoy gaiety, Maria; and it is natural  you should do so. However, it will not be necessary for you to be long  absent. In a city like Venice there are always fresh subjects for talk,  and the most exciting piece of scandal is but a three days' wonder. A  few weeks at Corfu will restore your nerves, which cannot but have been  shaken by what you have gone through, and you will come back here more  disposed than ever to appreciate the gaieties of Venice.\"    \"As long as it is for only a few weeks, father, I shall not care; for  you know I am very fond, too, of our beautiful home there. Still, I do  like Venice.\"    They had now reached the steps of the Palazzo Polani. They had not  proceeded by way of the Grand Canal, as the merchant was anxious that  his daughters should reach their home unrecognized, as, had they been  noticed, it would have given rise to no little excitement, and they had  had more than enough of this, and needed quiet and repose. Besides,  until the prisoners were in the safe custody of the officials of the  state, it was in every way desirable that the events of the morning  should remain unknown.    Their return home created quite a tumult of joy in the house. The  preparations that had been made had been kept a profound secret, as the  merchant could not be sure but that some other member of his household  was in the pay of Mocenigo. Thus, until the girls alighted at the  steps, none in the house were aware that any clue had been obtained as  to their hiding place. The women ran down with cries of joy. The men  would have shouted and cheered, had not Polani held up his hand.    \"The signoras have had more than enough excitement,\" he said. \"They are  grateful to you for your goodwill and affection, but for the present  they need quiet. They may have more to go through today. I pray you  that no word, as to their return, be said outside the house. I would  not that the news were whispered in the city, till the seignory decide  what is to be done in the matter.\"    As soon as the girls had gone upstairs to their rooms, the ship's boat  came alongside, and the prisoners were carried into the house, glances  of indignation and anger being cast at the gouvernante, who had, as  soon as she was placed on board the boat, closely veiled herself; and  some of the women broke out into threats and imprecations.    \"Captain Lontano, the servants will show you a room where your men can  guard the prisoners. You had better remain with them yourself. Let no  one, except your own men, enter the room.\"    Giuseppi was on the steps, and Francis stepped up to him and eagerly  asked, \"What news of the gondola?\"    \"I found her, stove in and full of water, behind the piles close to the  steps. Someone must have pushed her there, to be out of the way of the  traffic. She has several holes in her bottom, besides being stove in at  the gunwale where the other boat struck her. They must have thrust the  ends of their oars through her planks, out of sheer spite, when they  found that we had escaped them. Father and I have towed her round to  your steps, but I doubt whether she is worth repairing.\"    \"Well, we can't help it, Giuseppi. She has done her work; and if every  two ducats I lay out were to bring in as good a harvest, I should have  no reason to complain.\"    Having seen the prisoners safely placed, the merchant returned.    \"I think, Francisco, you must go with me. They will be sure to want to  question you.\"    \"I shall have to say what were my reasons for thinking your daughters  were hid in that hut, signor,\" Francis said as the gondola rowed  towards Saint Mark's; \"and I can only do that by telling of that secret  meeting. I do not want to denounce a number of people, besides  Ruggiero. I have no evidence against them, and do not know what they  were plotting, nor have I any wish to create for myself more enemies.  It is quite enough to have incurred the enmity of all the connections  of the house of Mocenigo.\"    \"That is true enough, Francisco, but I do not see how it is to be  avoided. Unfortunately, you did recognize others besides Ruggiero.\"    \"Quite so, signor, and I am not going to tell a lie about it, whatever  the consequences may be. Still, I wish I could get out of it.\"    \"I wish you could, Francis, but I do not see any escape for it,  especially as you say you did not recognize Ruggiero as the passenger  you carried.\"    \"No, signor, I did not. It might have been he, but I cannot say. He was  wrapped in a cloak, and I did not see his features.\"    \"It is a pity, Francisco, for had you known him, the statement that,  moved by curiosity, you followed him and saw him into that hut, would  have been sufficient without your entering into the other matter. Most  of my countrymen would not hesitate about telling a lie, to avoid  mixing themselves up further in such a matter, for the dangers of  making enemies are thoroughly appreciated here; but you are perfectly  right, and I like your steady love of the truth, whatever the  consequences to yourself; but certainly as soon as the matter is  concluded, it will be better for you to quit Venice for a time.\"    \"Are you going to the council direct, signor?\"    \"No. I am going first to the magistrates, to tell them that I have in  my hands five persons, who have been engaged in carrying off my  daughters, and beg them to send at once to take them into their  custody. Then I shall go before the council, and demand justice upon  Mocenigo, against whom we have now conclusive evidence. You will not be  wanted at the magistracy. My own evidence, that I found them keeping  guard over my daughters, will be quite sufficient for the present, and  after that the girls' evidence will be sufficient to convict them,  without your name appearing in the affair at all.    \"I will try whether I cannot keep your name from appearing before the  council also. Yes, I think I might do that; and as a first step, I give  you my promise not to name you, unless I find it absolutely necessary.  You may as well remain here in the gondola until I return.\"    It was upwards of an hour before Signor Polani came back to the boat.    \"I have succeeded,\" he said, \"in keeping your name out of it. I first  of all told my daughters' story, and then said that, having obtained  information that Ruggiero, before he was banished from Venice, was in  the habit of going sometimes at night to a hut on San Nicolo, I  proceeded thither, and found my daughters concealed in the hut whose  position had been described to me. Of course, they inquired where I had  obtained the information; but I replied that, as they knew, I had  offered a large reward which would lead to my daughters' discovery, and  that this reward had attracted one in the secret of Mocenigo, but that,  for the man's own safety, I had been compelled to promise that I would  not divulge his name.    \"Some of the council were inclined to insist, but others pointed out  that, for the ends of justice, it mattered in no way how I obtained the  information. I had, at any rate, gone to the island and found my  daughters there; and their evidence, if it was in accordance with what  I had stated, was amply sufficient to bring the guilt of the abduction  of my daughters home to Ruggiero, against whom other circumstances had  already excited suspicion. A galley has already started for the  mainland, with orders to bring him back a prisoner, and the girls are  to appear to give evidence tomorrow. The woman, Castaldi, is to be  interrogated by the council this afternoon, and I have no doubt she  will make a full confession, seeing that my daughters' evidence is, in  itself, sufficient to prove her guilt, and that it can be proved, from  other sources, that it was she who inveigled them away by a false  message from me.\"    \"I am glad indeed, signor, that I am not to be called, and that this  affair of the conspiracy is not to be brought up. I would, with your  permission, now return home. Giuseppi took a message to my father from  me, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#19)"],[1,"a  little chain of melancholy silvery notes, and a great titmouse bugled  clearly, \"Ting-ling!  Ting-ling!  Ting-ling!\"  Some one opened a window  of the house giving on to the lawn, and the last house-fly blundered  out into the cold air; and a company of gnats--surely the most hardy of  insects--was dancing in the pale sunlight by the summer-house, _above  the snow_.    The opening of the window had erupted the starlings into the  surrounding trees, there to whistle and indulge in a \"shiveree,\" such  as is dear to the heart of the excitable, social starling.  And our  thrush was standing motionless in the middle of the swept circle on the  lawn almost at once.  No one saw him go there.  Indeed, unless the  observer looked closely, no one saw him at all, for even then he was,  unless he moved, difficult to see, and, whatever had been his custom  before, in those days he moved but little.    He had come at even to a garden given over to hen-chaffinches--no  cocks, as we said--but at dawn, or, rather, his later hour for rising,  he found the garden given over to song-thrushes, all pale beside him,  all slim, all snaky of build--Continental song-thrushes, most like, and  the same only come to those parts in very hard weather, for they come a  long way.    Our song-thrush, standing on his one leg, looked at them with one  shrewd eye.  There were two of them in the snowless circle on the lawn,  which had been swept clear of the snow, that was now deep, before he  was up, and had also been replenished with bread.  Two thrushes sat in  the spruce-fir, and one on the top of the summer-house, and every jack  of them was ravenous.  He could expect no mercy from _them_.  They must  live, if they could, and there was not enough food for all.  And he  asked no mercy himself, either.  Still, it was long odds.    Then he showed that he, even a bird, knew the laws of strategy, the  essence of which is surprise.  He surprised everybody by suddenly  charging at the thrush on the lawn near him with a murderous ferocity  that took one's breath away.  It certainly would have taken away that  of the other song-thrush, if our friend had not knocked it out of him  by the impact.  By all the laws of precedence, of course, any one of  those others ought to have sent him, with his one leg, into headlong  retreat by merely threatening.  But our friend was not concerned with  the laws of precedence, it seemed.  He became a law unto himself, and a  most amazing \"character\" to boot.  Also, he fought like several demons,  and, by sheer reckless fury, removed that dumbfounded rival of his from  the lawn in twenty-one hectic seconds.    Then he fed--it was enough only to glance, just glance, at the other  thrushes and the chaffinches, after that astounding exhibition of his  character.  He fed, and, after he had stuffed full, he stood still a  little way off.    This was the signal for two of the thrushes in the spruce-fir to flap  down to the bread.  One got there.  The other saw what was coming, and  turned hastily back.  The one that got there snatched up a piece of  bread.  But he never ate it.  Something hit him on the side.  It felt  like the point of a skewer, but it was our thrush's beak, really, and  by the time he had recovered from that blow he found himself so busy  saving his eyesight that he was glad enough to drop his bread and go.    That, however, was not enough for our thrush.  He appeared to \"see  red,\" and with a terrible cruel, relentless \"redness.\"  He followed the  retreating foe to the spruce-fir, flying heavily and awkwardly by  reason of his smashed leg.  He perched beside him on the branch he  settled upon, nearly overbalancing, and perilously swaying and  wobbling, with wings wildly flapping, and he drove that thrush to  another branch, with such a rain of pecks that the feathers flew.  Nor  was even that enough.  He followed up the attack, and hustled the  thrush from that other branch, so that he flew down the snowed-up road.  Then our cripple, spinning in a whirl of snow, hurled himself upon the  other thrush in the tree, and drove him out of it into the road.    But even that did not suffice him, for devils seemed to have possessed  him, and the thought of opposition sent him crazy.  He blundered into  the privet-hedge, and unearthed a half-frozen _confrere_, who fled,  squawking peevishly, leaving one tail-feather in our friend's beak; and  finally he flew down to the road.    In the road, he first of all buried his face in snow, then fell on his  side, deep snow not being, he discovered, an ideal medium in which to  get about on one leg.  During that performance his rivals could have  abolished him five times over if they had had the heart to unite.  But  they seemed to think otherwise, and had not the heart for anything.  They sat still, with that helpless abandon that afflicts fowls and  other birds in disaster, and they seemed about to starve practically on  the spot, if left alone.    Our thrush, however, did not leave them alone.  They were a direct  threat to his only line of communication with life, so to  speak--namely, food.  Wherefore, either they or he must go.  Soon he  found that cart-ruts make convenient roads for the birds in the snow,  or perhaps it was the chaffinches, who were following one another in  lines along the cart-ruts, who showed him.    Then and there, in the road, our thrush seemed to go berserk.  He  landed upon the thrush nearest to him, spread-eagled and hammering like  a feathered devil.  There was a whirl of brown feathers and finely  powdered snow for about ten seconds, at the end of which time that  other thrush detached himself and fled, oven as his conqueror hurled  himself upon the next bird.    There were two here, side by side, but neither was quick enough to  parry our friend's lightning lunges, after he had beaten down their  guard with his wings; and they, too, got up and winged into the leaden,  frowning sky.  The others did not wait.  They had seen all they wanted  to, apparently, and would take no part in the play.  They faded out  among the drifting snowflakes, over the still, white fields, and our  thrush was left to the lawn, and the bread, and the swarming  chaffinches, whom he easily kept aloof, and--yes, there was no getting  away from it--the one thrush on the summer-house who, you will note,  had never moved.  But when he looked he found that thrush was not on  the summer-house, but on the lawn, eating bread; and when he flew down  to the lawn to investigate--he flew and landed very clumsily--he made a  discovery that seemed to surprise him; or did he already know it?  Anyway, the thrush on the lawn was a lady, and--well, what would you?  The cripple balanced as well as he could, and looked foolish.  It was  all he could do.    The day passed swiftly, and faded out in blinding snow.  Most of the  time the cripple stood motionless, watching his companion and guarding  his swept circle, and, as often as he could, he fed.  And neither then  nor at any other time, except once when the gardener nearly trod upon  him before he would move, did he utter a sound.  The last glimmer of  day showed him still at his post, motionless, all but invisible.  But  he roosted, as a matter of fact, in the privet-hedge, on the south side  of the summer-house, and this time he was not alone.    The day had been trying enough, with its fights and its three cats,  which passed within reach of him, and could have slain him--for his  injuries made him slow to get under way--if they had not failed to see  him, because so still.  The night, however, was a clouded terror.    Certainly he went to bed--if one may so call it--full, if not warm  exactly; but that was the only advantage.  It snowed with ghastly,  relentless steadiness, and it blew like the hacking of sharp knives.    But through it all, because full fed, the cripple, with all his  handicap, and his lady companion lived; lived to see the hard dawn pale  tardily; lived to watch the kind gardener--under strict orders  assuredly, or he would never have done it--sweep a space clear on the  lawn and spread food for the birds; lived to ruffle his feathers and  fly down; and lived to see the thaw which came that afternoon, when the  warm sou'-wester came romping over the land, and winter's last stand  was overcome by the forces of spring, and all the wild breathed a sigh  of relief and went abroad gayly to feed.    But the cripple lived to see other things.  For there came a day, about  a week later, when our cripple, who had been \"keeping company\" all the  time with his lady friend, heard the whole dawn awaken to a sudden  mighty chorus of thrush song.  I don't know why they all chose to burst  into song thus as at a given signal, but they did, and the effect upon  the cripple and his companion was curious.  He had just landed upon the  top of the summer-house on his one leg, in a particularly awkward and  unbalanced manner, and he perched, listening, as if rooted to the spot,  and with something nearly approaching horror in his eyes, it seemed to  me.    The female bird listened, too, for about a minute, and then, ignoring  the poor cripple as if he had never existed, hopped towards the  spruce-fir--atop of which a particularly fine and strong-voiced  songster was warbling--as if she were drawn by ropes.  And--oh,  horror!--the songster came down to _her_.    The cripple never uttered a sound, not a song, or a call, or a sign.  He hurled himself straight at this new rival like a bolt shot from a  crossbow, and he fought.  My word, how he fought!  But this new  antagonist was no half-frozen, half-starved Continental song thrush.  He was a Britisher, thick-set, bullet-headed, thick-necked, who had  wintered, perhaps, in the south of Ireland or farther, and he fought  like a Trojan.    All up and down the lawn the fight raged, and in and out of the hedges,  into the mountain ash and out again, down to the ground and up"]]]
