All this sort of gossip, apparently  aimless, has a very real purpose:  it enables the defenceless landlady  to size up the stranger who comes to prey upon her.  She had hardly had  a good look at this gentleman, nor even knew his name, and here he had  paid a week's rent and was already installed.    Aubrey divined the cause of her hesitation, and gave her his business  card.    \"All right, Mr. Gilbert,\" she said.  \"I'll send up the girl with some  clean towels and a latchkey.\"    Aubrey sat down in a rocking chair by the window, tucked the muslin  curtain to one side, and looked out upon the bright channel of Gissing  Street.  He was full of the exhilaration that springs from any change  of abode, but his romantic satisfaction in being so close to the  adorable Titania was somewhat marred by a sense of absurdity, which is  feared by young men more than wounds and death.  He could see the  lighted windows of the Haunted Bookshop quite plainly, but he could not  think of any adequate excuse for going over there.  And already he  realized that to be near Miss Chapman was not at all the consolation he  had expected it would be.  He had a powerful desire to see her.  He  turned off the gas, lit his pipe, opened the window, and focussed the  opera glasses on the door of the bookshop.  It brought the place  tantalizingly near.  He could see the table at the front of the shop,  Roger's bulletin board under the electric light, and one or two  nondescript customers gleaning along the shelves.  Then something  bounded violently under the third button of his shirt.  There she was!  In the bright, prismatic little circle of the lenses he could see  Titania.  Heavenly creature, in her white V-necked blouse and brown  skirt, there she was looking at a book.  He saw her put out one arm and  caught the twinkle of her wrist-watch.  In the startling familiarity of  the magnifying glass he could see her bright, unconscious face, the  merry profile of her cheek and chin. . . . \"The idea of that girl  working in a second-hand bookstore!\" he exclaimed.  \"It's positive  sacrilege!  Old man Chapman must be crazy.\"    He took out his pyjamas and threw them on the bed; put his toothbrush  and razor on the wash-basin, laid hairbrushes and O. Henry on the  bureau.  Feeling rather serio-comic he loaded his small revolver and  hipped it.  It was six o'clock, and he wound his watch.  He was a  little uncertain what to do:  whether to keep a vigil at the window  with the opera glasses, or go down in the street where he could watch  the bookshop more nearly.  In the excitement of the adventure he had  forgotten all about the cut on his scalp, and felt quite chipper.  In  leaving Madison Avenue he had attempted to excuse the preposterousness  of his excursion by thinking that a quiet week-end in Brooklyn would  give him an opportunity to jot down some tentative ideas for Daintybits  advertising copy which he planned to submit to his chief on Monday.  But now that he was here he felt the impossibility of attacking any  such humdrum task.  How could he sit down in cold blood to devise any  \"attention-compelling\" lay-outs for Daintybits Tapioca and Chapman's  Cherished Saratoga Chips, when the daintiest bit of all was only a few  yards away?  For the first time was made plain to him the amazing power  of young women to interfere with the legitimate commerce of the world.  He did get so far as to take out his pad of writing paper and jot down                  CHAPMAN'S CHERISHED CHIPS      These delicate wafers, crisped by a secret process, cherish in their  unique tang and flavour all the life-giving nutriment that has made the  potato the King of Vegetables----      But the face of Miss Titania kept coming between his hand and brain.  Of what avail to flood the world with Chapman Chips if the girl herself  should come to any harm? \"Was this the face that launched a thousand  chips?\" he murmured, and for an instant wished he had brought The  Oxford Book of English Verse instead of O. Henry.    A tap sounded at his door, and Mrs. Schiller appeared.  \"Telephone for  you, Mr. Gilbert,\" she said.    \"For ME?\" said Aubrey in amazement.  How could it be for him, he  thought, for no one knew he was there.    \"The party on the wire asked to speak to the gentleman who arrived  about half an hour ago, and I guess you must be the one he means.\"    \"Did he say who he is?\" asked Aubrey.    \"No, sir.\"    For a moment Aubrey thought of refusing to answer the call.  Then it  occurred to him that this would arouse Mrs. Schiller's suspicions.  He  ran down to the telephone, which stood under the stairs in the front  hall.    \"Hello,\" he said.    \"Is this the new guest?\" said a voice--a deep, gargling kind of voice.    \"Yes,\" said Aubrey.    \"Is this the gentleman that arrived half an hour ago with a handbag?\"    \"Yes; who are you?\"    \"I'm a friend,\" said the voice; \"I wish you well.\"    \"How do you do, friend and well-wisher,\" said Aubrey genially.    \"I schust want to warn you that Gissing Street is not healthy for you,\"  said the voice.    \"Is that so?\" said Aubrey sharply.  \"Who are you?\"    \"I am a friend,\" buzzed the receiver.  There was a harsh, bass note in  the voice that made the diaphragm at Aubrey's ear vibrate tinnily.  Aubrey grew angry.    \"Well, Herr Freund,\" he said, \"if you're the well-wisher I met on the  Bridge last night, watch your step.  I've got your number.\"    There was a pause.  Then the other repeated, ponderously, \"I am a  friend.  Gissing Street is not healthy for you.\"  There was a click,  and he had rung off.    Aubrey was a good deal perplexed.  He returned to his room, and sat in  the dark by the window, smoking a pipe and thinking, with his eyes on  the bookshop.    There was no longer any doubt in his mind that something sinister was  afoot.  He reviewed in memory the events of the past few days.    It was on Monday that a bookloving friend had first told him of the  existence of the shop on Gissing Street.  On Tuesday evening he had  gone round to visit the place, and had stayed to supper with Mr.  Mifflin.  On Wednesday and Thursday he had been busy at the office, and  the idea of an intensive Daintybit campaign in Brooklyn had occurred to  him.  On Friday he had dined with Mr. Chapman, and had run into a  curious string of coincidences.  He tabulated them:--    (1) The Lost ad in the Times on Friday morning.    (2) The chef in the elevator carrying the book that was supposed to be  lost--he being the same man Aubrey had seen in the bookshop on Tuesday  evening.    (3) Seeing the chef again on Gissing Street.    (4) The return of the book to the bookshop.    (5) Mifflin had said that the book had been stolen from him.  Then why  should it be either advertised or returned?    (6) The rebinding of the book.    (7) Finding the original cover of the book in Weintraub's drug store.    (8) The affair on the Bridge.    (9) The telephone message from \"a friend\"--a friend with an obviously  Teutonic voice.      He remembered the face of anger and fear displayed by the Octagon chef  when he had spoken to him in the elevator.  Until this oddly menacing  telephone message, he could have explained the attack on the Bridge as  merely a haphazard foot-pad enterprise; but now he was forced to  conclude that it was in some way connected with his visits to the  bookshop.  He felt, too, that in some unknown way Weintraub's drug  store had something to do with it.  Would he have been attacked if he  had not taken the book cover from the drug store?  He got the cover out  of his bag and looked at it again.  It was of plain blue cloth, with  the title stamped in gold on the back, and at the bottom the lettering  London:  Chapman and Hall.  From the width of the backstrap it was  evident that the book had been a fat one.  Inside the front cover the  figure 60 was written in red pencil--this he took to be Roger Mifflin's  price mark.  Inside the back cover he found the following notations--        vol. 3--166, 174, 210, 329, 349    329 ff. cf. W. W.      These references were written in black ink, in a small, neat hand.  Below them, in quite a different script and in pale violet ink, was  written      153 (3) 1, 2      \"I suppose these are page numbers,\" Aubrey thought.  \"I think I'd  better have a look at that book.\"    He put the cover in his pocket and went out for a bite of supper.  \"It's a puzzle with three sides to it,\" he thought, as he descended the  crepitant stairs, \"The Bookshop, the Octagon, and Weintraub's; but that  book seems to be the clue to the whole business.\"        Chapter VIII    Aubrey Goes to the Movies, and Wishes he Knew More German      A few doors from the bookshop was a small lunchroom named after the  great city of Milwaukee, one of those pleasant refectories where the  diner buys his food at the counter and eats it sitting in a flat-armed  chair.  Aubrey got a bowl of soup, a cup of coffee, beef stew, and bran  muffins, and took them to an empty seat by the window.  He ate with one  eye on the street.  From his place in the corner he could command the  strip of pavement in front of Mifflin's shop.  Halfway through the stew  he saw Roger come out onto the pavement and begin to remove the books  from the boxes.    After finishing his supper he lit one of his \"mild but they satisfy\"  cigarettes and sat in the comfortable warmth of a near-by radiator.  A  large black cat lay sprawled on the next chair.  Up at the service  counter there was a pleasant clank of stout crockery as occasional  customers came in and ordered their victuals.  Aubrey began to feel a  relaxation swim through his veins.  Gissing Street was very bright and  orderly in its Saturday evening bustle.  Certainly it was grotesque to  imagine melodrama hanging about a second-hand bookshop in Brooklyn.

There  is no evidence, however, that there was any encounter between these  armed ships and German vessels prior to the outbreak of the war.    THE PRESIDENT'S WAR MESSAGE.--When Russia deposed the Czar and  established a democratic government, in March, 1917, the last reason was  removed which might have held us back from a declaration of war. Many  believed that it would have been illogical for us to fight for democracy  side by side with one of the greatest of autocracies. President Wilson  called Congress in special session and on April 2 delivered his famous  war message, asking Congress to declare that a state of war existed  between the United States and Germany.    In the message he told of the various acts of Germany which had led up  to the verge of war, recited the steps which our government had taken to  bring Germany to realize the inevitable results of her crimes against  civilization, and concluded by asking Congress to declare war. The  President stated that the aims of the United States in the war are:    1. That the people of every nation may determine the form of government  under which they wish to live.    2. That the small nations may have the right to exist and be protected  against aggression.    3. That the future peace of the world may be guaranteed through the  formation of a league of nations.    4. That the world may be made safe for democracy.    THE DECLARATION OF WAR.--In accordance with the recommendation of the  President, Congress declared war against Germany on April 6, 1917. War  was not declared at this time against Germany's allies, Austria, Turkey,  and Bulgaria. A few days later, however, at the instance of Germany,  Austria and Turkey broke off diplomatic relations. On December 7, 1917,  the United States declared war on Austria-Hungary.    Following the declaration of war with Germany, steps were at once taken  to put the country in a position to give effective aid to our  associates, and the President from time to time has requested Congress  to grant authority to do those things that would enable us to take an  active part in the war.    OTHER COUNTRIES ENTER THE WAR.--After the United States entered the  war, many other countries, especially Brazil and some of the Spanish  American countries, either broke off relations with Germany or declared  war against her. Most of these countries had close commercial  relationships with the United States, which would have been seriously  interfered with had they remained neutral.    SPURLOS VERSENKT.--The decision of some of the South American  countries to side against Germany was probably hastened by a typical  piece of German bad faith. Argentina was at peace with Germany. In spite  of that fact, the German minister at Buenos Aires (the Argentine  capital) telegraphed to his government that if possible Argentine ships  should be spared, but if not, they should be sunk without leaving a  trace (\"_spurlos versenkt_).\" This would involve the drowning or  murdering of the crews, so that there would be no inconvenient protest  on the part of the Argentine government. It should be added that at the  request of the German minister, the Swedish minister at Buenos Aires  sent these dispatches in code as if they were his own private messages.  In this way the German minister was able to have them sent over cable  lines controlled by the Allies.        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1. What is a \"tank\"? What are small      tanks called? 2. Define socialism; Bolsheviki. 3. On a map of      Europe show Germany and her allies in black. Mark with black      lines other territory held or controlled by the Central      Powers at the close of 1917. 4. On a map of southern Europe      show Italy's farthest advance into Austrian territory in      1917. 5. Collect pictures of Rheims Cathedral, before and      after being bombarded by the Germans; also pictures of other      places destroyed by bombardments. Get pictures of different      sorts of tanks and airplanes, of destroyers and Eagle boats.      6. What was the object of the Germans in devastating the      country when they retreated to the Hindenburg line? 7. Why      did Germany think Mexico and Japan might join her in an      attack on the United States? 8. What was the date on which      the United States declared war on Germany? 9. Why did not the      United States declare war on Turkey or Bulgaria? 10. Make a      list of the countries of South America and Central America      that declared war on Germany.

CHAPTER XII    THE WAR IN 1918      FAILURE OF GERMAN PEACE OFFENSIVE.--During the fall of 1917 Germany  had started a great discussion of the terms of the peace which should  close the war. In general the position taken by German spokesmen was  \"peace without annexations and without indemnities,\" as proposed by the  Russian Bolsheviki. Such talk was designed to weaken the war spirit of  the Allied peoples, and perhaps to make the German people believe that  they were fighting a war of self-defense. The time was ripe for a  statement of the war aims of Germany's opponents. This statement, later  approved in general by Allied statesmen, was made by President Wilson in  his address to Congress on January 8, 1918. It is discussed in detail in  Chapter XIV. It was not satisfactory to Germany's rulers, for they hoped  to secure better terms in a peace of bargains and compromises.    RUSSIA MAKES A SEPARATE PEACE.--Only in Russia was this German peace  offensive a success. In the last chapter we saw how in the latter part  of 1917 the Bolsheviki had gained control of the government of Russia  and had arranged an armistice with the Central Powers. This meant the  stopping of all fighting along the eastern front and the consequent  freeing of many thousands of German soldiers to fight in the west.    At Brest-Litovsk, a town in Russian Poland which had been occupied by  the troops of the Central Powers, a meeting of delegates was called to  arrange the terms of peace. The negotiations at this place lasted from  December 23, 1917, to February 10, 1918. The Germans had determined to  keep large portions of Russian territory. At the conference the German  delegates flatly refused to promise to withdraw their troops from the  occupied parts of Russia after the peace. By February 10 hope of any  settlement that would satisfy Russia had disappeared and the Bolshevik  delegates left Brest-Litovsk. The war, so far as Russia was concerned,  was at an end, but no treaty of peace had been signed. The Bolshevik  government issued orders for the complete demobilization of the Russian  armies on all the battle fronts.    Germany, determined to compel Russia to accept her terms, renewed her  military operations on February 18. The result was that Lenine and  Trotzky, the Bolshevik leaders, were forced to agree to the conditions  which had been laid down by the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk.  Nevertheless the Germans continued their advance, with practically no  opposition, to within seventy miles of Petrograd.    THE SEPARATION OF UKRAINIA AND FINLAND.--Ukrainia, the southwestern  corner of Russia, is the home of a Slavic people--the Little  Russians--closely akin to the Russians proper. The people of Finland, in  the extreme northwest, are of a distinctly different race. In both  these regions there were set up independent governments which resisted  the rule of the Bolsheviki. With the aid of German troops the power of  the Bolsheviki in the new states was soon destroyed. Through the setting  up of these states, particularly Ukrainia, Germany hoped to secure grain  supplies, and to control large iron and coal deposits. Dissatisfaction  of the people with German control, however, interfered seriously with  the realizing of such hopes.    [Illustration: TREATY OF BREST-LITOVSK States and Provinces taken from  Russia]    THE PEACE OF BREST-LITOVSK.--On March 3 peace between Russia and the  Central Powers was finally signed at Brest-Litovsk. By the terms of the  treaties Russia was compelled (1) to surrender her western provinces of  Poland, Lithuania, Livonia, Esthonia, and Courland; (2) to recognize the  independence of Ukrainia and Finland; (3) to cede to Turkey certain  important districts south of the Caucasus Mountains;[5] and (4) to pay  a tremendous indemnity. The falsity of the German talk of \"no  annexations and no indemnities\" was now evident. Few more disastrous  treaties have ever been forced upon a vanquished nation. It has been  estimated that the treaties of Brest-Litovsk took from Russia 4 per cent  of her total area, 26 per cent of her population, 37 per cent of her  food stuffs production, 26 per cent of her railways, 33 per cent of her  manufacturing industries, 75 per cent of her coal, and 73 per cent of  her iron.    ROUMANIA MAKES PEACE.--Roumania, deserted by Russia, was forced to  make peace in the spring of 1918, by ceding to her enemies the whole of  the Dobrudja and also about 3000 square miles of territory on her  western frontier. The Central Powers, moreover, were given control of  the vast petroleum fields and the rich wheat lands of the defeated  nation.    A little later, however, the Russian province of Bessarabia decided to  unite"]]]
