Our  imaginary visitor upon reaching Jupiter would, under the influence of  the planet's strong force of gravity, drop out of sight, with the speed  of a shot, swallowed up in the vast atmosphere of probably hot, and  perhaps partially incandescent, gases. When he had sunk--supposing his  identity could be preserved--to a depth of thousands of miles he might  not yet have found any solid part of the planet; and, perchance, there  is no solid nucleus even at the very center.    The cloudy aspect of Jupiter immediately strikes the telescopic  observer. The huge planet is filled with color, and with the animation  of constant movement, but there is no appearance of markings, like those  on Mars, recalling the look of the earth. There are no white polar caps,  and no shadings that suggest the outlines of continents and oceans. What  every observer, even with the smallest telescope, perceives at once is a  pair of strongly defined dark belts, one on either side of, and both  parallel to, the planet's equator. These belts are dark compared with  the equatorial band between them and with the general surface of the  planet toward the north and the south, but they are not of a gray or  neutral shade. On the contrary, they show decided, and, at times,  brilliant colors, usually of a reddish tone. More delicate tints,  sometimes a fine pink, salmon, or even light green, are occasionally to  be seen about the equatorial zone, and the borders of the belts, while  near the poles the surface is shadowed with bluish gray, imperceptibly  deepening from the lighter hues of the equator.    All this variety of tone and color makes of a telescopic view of Jupiter  a picture that will not quickly fade from the memory; while if an  instrument of considerable power is used, so that the wonderful details  of the belts, with their scalloped edges, their diagonal filaments,  their many divisions, and their curious light and dark spots, are made  plain, the observer is deeply impressed with the strangeness of the  spectacle, and the more so as he reflects upon the enormous real  magnitude of that which is spread before his eye. The whole earth  flattened out would be but a small blotch on that gigantic disk!    Then, the visible rotation of the great Jovian globe, whose effects  become evident to a practised eye after but a few minutes' watching,  heightens the impression. And the presence of the four satellites, whose  motions in their orbits are also evident, through the change in their  positions, during the course of a single not prolonged observation,  adds its influence to the effectiveness of the scene. Indeed, color and  motion are so conspicuous in the immense spectacle presented by Jupiter  that they impart to it a powerful suggestion of life, which the mind  does not readily divest itself of when compelled to face the evidence  that Jupiter is as widely different from the earth, and as diametrically  opposed to lifelike conditions, as we comprehend them, as a planet  possibly could be.    The great belts lie in latitudes about corresponding to those in which  the trade-winds blow upon the earth, and it has often been suggested  that their existence indicates a similarity between the atmospheric  circulation of Jupiter and that of the world in which we live. No doubt  there are times when the earth, seen with a telescope from a distant  planet, would present a belted appearance somewhat resembling that of  Jupiter, but there would almost certainly be no similar display of  colors in the clouds, and the latter would exhibit no such persistence  in general form and position as characterizes those of Jupiter. Our  clouds are formed by the action of the sun, producing evaporation of  water; on Jupiter, whose mean distance from the sun is more than five  times as great as ours, the intensity of the solar rays is reduced to  less than one twenty-fifth part of their intensity on the earth, so that  the evaporation can not be equally active there, and the tendency to  form aerial currents and great systems of winds must be proportionally  slight. In brief, the clouds of Jupiter are probably of an entirely  different origin from that of terrestrial clouds, and rather resemble  the chaotic masses of vapor that enveloped the earth when it was still  in a seminebulous condition, and before its crust had formed.    Although the strongest features of the disk of Jupiter are the great  cloud belts, and the white or colored spots in the equatorial zone, yet  the telescope shows many markings north and south of the belts,  including a number of narrower and fainter belts, and small light or  dark spots. None of them is absolutely fixed in position with  reference to others. In other words, all of the spots, belts, and  markings shift their places to a perceptible extent, the changes being  generally very slow and regular, but occasionally quite rapid. The main  belts never entirely disappear, and never depart very far from their  mean positions with respect to the equator, but the smaller belts toward  the north and south are more or less evanescent. Round or oblong spots,  as distinguished from belts, are still more variable and transient. The  main belts themselves show great internal commotion, frequently  splitting up, through a considerable part of their length, and sometimes  apparently throwing out projections into the lighter equatorial zone,  which occasionally resemble bridges, diagonally spanning the broad space  between the belts.    [Illustration: JUPITER AS SEEN AT THE LICK OBSERVATORY IN 1889. THE  GREAT RED SPOT IS VISIBLE, TOGETHER WITH THE INDENTATION IN THE SOUTH  BELT.]    Perhaps the most puzzling phenomenon that has ever made its appearance  on Jupiter is the celebrated \"great red spot,\" which was first noticed  in 1878, although it has since been shown to be probably identical with  a similar spot seen in 1869, and possibly with one noticed in 1857.  This spot, soon after its discovery in 1878, became a clearly defined  red oval, lying near the southern edge of the south belt in latitude  about 30 deg. Its length was nearly one third of the diameter of the disk  and its width almost one quarter as great as its length. Translated into  terrestrial measure, it was about 30,000 miles long and 7,000 miles  broad.    In 1879 it seemed to deepen in color until it became a truly wonderful  object, its redness of hue irresistibly suggesting the idea that it was  something hot and glowing. During the following years it underwent  various changes of appearance, now fading almost to invisibility and now  brightening again, but without ever completely vanishing, and it is  still (1901) faintly visible.    Nobody has yet suggested an altogether probable and acceptable theory as  to its nature. Some have said that it might be a part of the red-hot  crust of the planet elevated above the level of the clouds; others that  its appearance might be due to the clearing off of the clouds above a  heated region of the globe beneath, rendering the latter visible through  the opening; others that it was perhaps a mass of smoke and vapor  ejected from a gigantic volcano, or from the vents covering a broad area  of volcanic action; others that it might be a vast incandescent slag  floating upon the molten globe of the planet and visible through, or  above, the enveloping clouds; and others have thought that it could be  nothing but a cloud among clouds, differing, for unknown reasons, in  composition and cohesion from its surroundings. All of these hypotheses  except the last imply the existence, just beneath the visible cloud  shell, of a more or less stable and continuous surface, either solid or  liquid.    When the red spot began to lose distinctness a kind of veil seemed to be  drawn over it, as if light clouds, floating at a superior elevation, had  drifted across it. At times it has been reduced in this manner to a  faint oval ring, the rim remaining visible after the central part has  faded from sight.    One of the most remarkable phenomena connected with the mysterious spot  is a great bend, or scallop, in the southern edge of the south belt  adjacent to the spot. This looks as if it were produced by the spot, or  by the same cause to which the spot owes its existence. If the spot were  an immense mountainous elevation, and the belt a current of liquid, or  of clouds, flowing past its base, one would expect to see some such bend  in the stream. The visual evidence that the belt is driven, or forced,  away from the neighborhood of the spot seems complete. The appearance of  repulsion between them is very striking, and even when the spot fades  nearly to invisibility the curve remains equally distinct, so that in  using a telescope too small to reveal the spot itself one may discover  its location by observing the bow in the south belt. The suggestion of a  resemblance to the flowing of a stream past the foot of an elevated  promontory, or mountain, is strengthened by the fact, which was  observed early in the history of the spot, that markings involved in the  south belt have a quicker rate of rotation about the planet's axis than  that of the red spot, so that such markings, first seen in the rear of  the red spot, gradually overtake and pass it, and eventually leave it  behind, as boats in a river drift past a rock lying in the midst of the  current.    This leads us to another significant fact concerning the peculiar  condition of Jupiter's surface. Not only does the south belt move  perceptibly faster than the red spot, but, generally speaking, the  various markings on the surface of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#19)"],[1,"and fold in the  white beaten stiff. Drop by spoonfuls into hot fat one-half inch deep.  Turn once while cooking. When done, drain on brown paper and serve.      ~CRUMB GRIDDLE CAKES~--Soak one pint of bread crumbs in one pint of sour  milk for an hour, then add a level teaspoon of soda dissolved in one cup  of sweet milk, and one well beaten egg, half a teaspoon of salt and  flour enough to make a drop batter as thick as griddle cakes are usually  made.      ~HOMINY CAKES~--To two cups of boiled hominy add two tablespoons of  melted butter. Break the whole very fine with spoon or fork. Add two  well beaten eggs, one-third teaspoon of salt, and a saltspoon of pepper.  Form into little cakes, after adding enough milk to make it of the right  consistency to handle. Set cakes on buttered dish and dust with a little  finely grated cheese. Bake in hot oven and serve at once.      ~OATMEAL CAKE~--Mix fine oatmeal into a stiff dough with milk-warm  water, roll it to the thinness almost of a wafer, bake on a griddle or  iron plate placed over a slow fire for three or four minutes, then place  it on edge before the fire to harden. This will be good for months, if  kept in a dry place.      ~PINEAPPLE PANCAKES~--Make a batter using half pound sifted flour and  three good sized eggs with a cupful of milk. This makes a very thin  batter. When smooth and free from lumps, bake in a well buttered frying  pan, making the cakes about eight inches in diameter. As soon as brown  on one side turn. When cooked on both sides remove to a hot serving dish  and sprinkle with sweetened pineapple. Bake the remainder of batter in  the same way, piling in layers with the pineapple between the cakes. Cut  in triangular pieces like pie and serve very hot.      ~SQUASH FRITTERS~--To two cups of mashed dry winter squash add one cup  of milk, two well beaten eggs, one teaspoon of salt, a little pepper and  one heaping teaspoon of baking powder. Beat well and drop by spoonfuls  into hot butter or cooking oil and fry.          PIES AND PASTRIES      ~A GOOD CRUST FOR GREAT PIES~--To a peck of flour, add the yolks of  three eggs. Boil some water, put in half a pound of fried suet and a  pound and a half of butter. Skim off the butter and suet and as much of  the liquor as will make a light crust. Mix well and roll out.      ~CRUST FOR CUSTARDS~--Take a half pound of flour, six ounces of butter,  the yolks of two eggs, three spoonfuls of cream. Mix well and roll very  thin.      ~DRIPPING CRUST~--Take a pound and a half of beef drippings; boil in  water, strain and let it get cold, taking off the hard fat. Scrape off  and boil it four or five times; then work it up well into three pounds  of flour, then add enough cold water to make dough, just stiff enough to  roll. This makes a very fine crust.      ~PASTE FOR TARTS~--One pound of flour, three-quarters of a pound of  butter and just enough cold water to mix together. Beat well with a  rolling pin.      ~PUFF PASTE~--Take a quarter of a peck of flour, rub in a pound of  butter, make it up into a light paste with a little cold waters, just  stiff enough to handle; then roll out to about the thickness of a crown  piece. Spread over with butter and sprinkle over with flour, then double  up and roll out again. Double and roll out seven or eight times. It is  then fit for all kinds of pies and tarts that require a puff paste.      ~APPLE PIE~--Make up a puff paste crust and lay some around the sides of  a dish. Pare and quarter apples. Put a layer of apples in the dish,  sprinkle with sugar, and add a little lemon peel, cut up fine, a little  lemon juice, a few cloves; then the rest of the apples, sugar and so on.  Sweeten to taste. Boil the peels and cores of the apples in a little  water, strain and boil the syrup with a little sugar. Pour over the  apples. Put on the upper crust and bake. A little quince or marmalade  may be used, if desired.    Pears may be used instead of apples, omitting the quince or marmalade.    Pies may be buttered when taken from oven. If a sauce is desired, beat  up the yolks of two eggs, add half pint of cream, little nutmeg and  sugar. Put over a slow fire, stirring well until it just boils up. Take  off the upper crust and pour the sauce over the pie, replacing the  crust.      ~APPLE PIE--SOUTHERN STYLE~--For four pies half pound butter, quarter  pound of lard, half dinner teaspoon of salt, work four cups flour and  the above ingredients with a fork, and then mix with ice water and mix  it so it will just stick together. Then ready for use.      ~BEATEN CREAM PIE~--Line a plate with good paste, prick in several  places to prevent rising out of shape. Bake and spread over some jelly  or jam about half an inch thick, and cover with one cup of cream beaten  stiff with two rounding tablespoons of powdered sugar and flavored with  one teaspoon of vanilla.      ~LARGE LEMON PIE~--Mix three level teaspoons of corn starch smooth in a  little cold water, and stir into three cups of boiling water. Cook five  minutes; stir in one level tablespoon of butter, the juice and grated  yellow rind of two lemons, one and one-half cups of sugar, and the yolks  of three eggs. Cook until the egg thickens, take from the fire and cool.  Line a large pie plate with paste and gash it in several places to  prevent rising unevenly, bake and fill with the mixture. Cover with a  meringue made from the white of three eggs beaten with six level  tablespoons of powdered sugar. Set in the oven to color.      ~LEMON PIE~--This is an old fashion pie, because it is baked between two  crusts, yet many have called it the best of all kinds. Grate the yellow  rind of two lemons, take off all the white skin and chop the remainder  very fine, discarding all the seeds. Add two cups of sugar and two  beaten eggs. Mix well and pour into a paste lined plate cover, and bake  thirty minutes.      ~NUT MINCE PIES~--One cup of walnut meats chopped fine, two cups of  chopped apple, one cup of raisins, one and one-half cups of sugar mixed  with one teaspoon each of cinnamon and allspice and one-half teaspoon  each of cloves and salt, one-half cup of vinegar and one-half cup of  water or fruit juice. Mix thoroughly. This quantity makes two large  pies.    ~PINEAPPLE CREAM PIE~--One-half cup butter, one cup sugar, one can  shredded pineapple, one-half cup milk, two eggs. Cream the butter, add  gradually the sugar, then the pineapple, milk and eggs well beaten. Mix  well and bake in one crust like custard pie. When cool cover with a  meringue or with whipped cream sweetened and flavored with vanilla.      ~PLAIN PIE PASTE~--Sift one and one-half cups of flour with a saltspoon  of salt and rub in one-quarter cup of lard. Moisten with very cold water  until a stiff dough is formed. Pat out and lay on one-quarter cup of  cold butter rolled out in a sheet. Fold in three layers, turn half way  round, and pat out again. Fold and roll twice more. This will make one  large pie with two crusts.      ~CHERRY PIE~--Make a good crust, lining the sides of a pie pan. Place  stoned cherries, well sweetened, in the pan and cover with upper crust.  Bake in slow oven. (A few red currants may be added to the cherries if  desired.)    Plums or gooseberry pies may be made in the same way.      ~CHERRY PIE~--Roll two large soda crackers into fine dust and stone  cherries enough to measure two cups. Line a pie plate with good rich  paste and scatter one-half cup of sugar over. Sprinkle one-half of the  cracker dust, and over that one-half of the cherries. Repeat the three  layers, pour on one cup of cherry juice and cold water, cover with paste  and bake in a moderate oven.      ~FRESH RASPBERRY PIE~--Line a pie plate with rich paste, fill with  raspberries and scatter on sugar to sweeten. Cover with a crust and bake  in a quick oven. When done draw from the oven, cut a gash in the top,  and pour in the following mixture: The yolks of two eggs beaten light  with a tablespoon of sugar and mixed with one cup of hot thin cream. Set  back in the oven for five minutes.      ~GREEN CURRANT PIE~--Stew and mash a pint of rather green currants,  sweeten abundantly, add a sprinkling of flour or a rolled cracker and  bake with two crusts. Dust generously with powdered sugar.      ~GREEN TOMATO PIE~--Take green tomatoes not yet turned and peel and  slice wafer thin. Fill a plate nearly full, add a tablespoonful vinegar  and plenty of sugar, dot with bits of butter and flavor with nutmeg or  lemon. Bake in one or two crusts as preferred.      ~LEMON CREAM PIE~--Stir into one cup of boiling water one tablespoonful  of cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water. Cook until thickened and  clear, then add one cup of sugar, a teaspoonful of butter, and the juice  and grated rind of two lemons. Add the beaten yolks of three eggs and  take from the fire. Have ready the bottom crust of a pie that has been  baked, first pricking with a fork to prevent blisters. Place the custard  in the crust and bake half an hour. When done take from the oven and  spread over the top a meringue made from the stiffly whipped whites of  the eggs, and three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Shut off the oven so it  will be as cool as possible giving the meringue plenty of time to rise,  stiffen and color to a delicate gold.      ~APPLE FRITTERS~--Beat the yolks of eight eggs and the white of four  together. Add a quart of cream. Put over a fire and heat until you can  bear your finger in it. Add quarter of a pint of sack, three-quarters of  a pint of ale and make a posset of it. When cool put in nutmeg, ginger,  salt and flour. The batter should be pretty thick. Add pippins, sliced  or scraped and fry in deep fat.      ~APPLE SLUMP~--Fill a deep baking dish with apples, pared, cored and  sliced. Scatter on a little cinnamon and cover with good paste rolled a  little thicker than for pie. Bake in a moderate oven until the apples  are done, serve in the same dish, cutting the crust into"]]]
