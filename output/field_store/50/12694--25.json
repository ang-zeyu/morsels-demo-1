[71-5] According to Northern chorography, the Eastern Settlement had one  hundred and ninety farmsteads, twelve churches, and two monasteries; the  Western Settlement had ninety farmsteads and three churches.    [71-6] The cathedral (hardly magnificent) was in the Eastern Settlement  (_i.e._, in southern Greenland), no doubt the present Kakortok. The  village of Gardar, which gave its name to the bishopric, was at the  present Kaksiarsuk. The authority which makes this identification  possible, is Ivar Bardsen's description of Greenland written in that  country in the fourteenth century. He was for many years steward to the  Gardar bishopric. An English version of Bardsen's description is printed  in Major's _The Voyages of the Venetian Brothers Zeno_ (London, 1873).  See also Fiske, _The Discovery of America_, pp. 239 and 242.    [71-7] That is, about 1418. The last notice of Greenland based on  Northern tradition is from the year 1409, telling of a marriage ceremony  performed by Endride Andreson, the last bishop. See Laing's _The Sagas of  the Norse Kings_ (London, 1889), p. 177.    [71-8] From Ivar Bardsen's description of Greenland it is known that the  Greenlanders first came in conflict with the Eskimos during the  fourteenth century. He was appointed to lead an expedition from the  Eastern Settlement against the Skrellings (Eskimos), who had taken  possession of the Western Settlement. When he arrived there the  Skrellings had departed, and they found nothing but ruins and some cattle  running wild. See _Antiquitates Americanae_, p. 316.    The letter of Nicholas V. refers to an attack on the Western Settlement,  of which there is no other recorded evidence. It is not likely that it  will ever be possible to determine whether the settlement owed its final  destruction to the irruptions of the Eskimos, \"to the ravages of  pestilence, to the enforced neglect of the mother country--itself during  the fifteenth century too often in sore straits--to the iniquitous  restrictions in commerce imposed by the home government, or to a  combination of several of these evils.\" There was a regular succession of  bishops from 1124 to the end of the fourteenth, or perhaps the beginning  of the fifteenth century.    [73-1] Addressed to the two bishops of Skalholt and Holar, in Iceland.    [73-2] The Archbishop of Drontheim in Norway.    [73-3] Alexander VI. was pope from 1492 to 1503.    [74-1] Evidently this is only an approximate statement.    [74-2] There are no records that this man ever reached either Greenland  or Iceland. The Greenland colony was not entirely forgotten by the home  government (Denmark-Norway). In the beginning of the sixteenth century,  Archbishop Valkendorf of Drontheim had agitated the question of searching  for the Greenland colony. During the reign of Frederick II. of  Denmark-Norway, Mogens Heinesen was in 1579 sent out, but he did not  reach the island. The Englishman John Davis, in 1585, visited the western  coast of Greenland, but found no Europeans.          ORIGINAL NARRATIVES OF THE VOYAGES OF COLUMBUS          ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LORDS THE CATHOLIC SOVEREIGNS AND  CRISTOBAL COLON[77-1]      The things prayed for, and which Your Highnesses give and grant to Don  Cristobal Colon[77-2] as some recompense for what he is to discover in  the Oceans, and for the voyage which now, with the help of God, he has  engaged to make therein in the service of Your Highnesses, are the  following:    Firstly, that Your Highnesses, as actual Lords of the said Oceans,  appoint from this date the said Don Cristobal Colon to be your Admiral in  all those islands and mainlands which by his activity and industry shall  be discovered or acquired in the said oceans, during his lifetime, and  likewise, after his death, his heirs and successors one after another in  perpetuity, with all the pre-eminences and prerogatives appertaining to  the said office, and in the same manner as Don Alfonso Enriques, your  High Admiral of Castile,[78-1] and his predecessors in the said office  held it in their districts.--It so pleases their Highnesses. Juan de  Coloma.    Likewise, that Your Highnesses appoint the said Don Cristobal Colon to be  your Viceroy and Governor General in all the said islands and mainlands  and in the islands which, as aforesaid, he may discover and acquire[78-2]  in the said seas; and that for the government of each and any of them he  may make choice of three persons for each office, and that Your  Highnesses may select and choose the one who shall be most serviceable to  you; and thus the lands which our Lord shall permit him to discover and  acquire for the service of Your Highnesses, will be the better  governed.--It so pleases their Highnesses. Juan de Coloma.    Item, that of all and every kind of merchandise, whether pearls, precious  stones, gold, silver, spices, and other objects and merchandise  whatsoever, of whatever kind, name and sort, which may be bought,  bartered, discovered, acquired and obtained within the limits of the said  Admiralty, Your Highnesses grant from now henceforth to the said Don  Cristobal, and will that he may have and take for himself, the tenth part  of the whole, after deducting all the expenses which may be incurred  therein, so that of what shall remain clear and free he may have and take  the tenth part for himself, and may do therewith as he pleases, the other  nine parts being reserved for Your Highnesses.--It so pleases their  Highnesses. Juan de Coloma.    Likewise, that if on account of the merchandise which he might bring from  the said islands and lands which thus, as aforesaid, may be acquired or  discovered, or of that which may be taken in exchange for the same from  other merchants here, any suit should arise in the place where the said  commerce and traffic shall be held and conducted; and if by the  pre-eminence of his office of Admiral it appertains to him to take  cognizance of such suit; it may please Your Highnesses that he or his  deputy, and not another judge, shall take cognizance thereof and give  judgment in the same from henceforth.--It so pleases their Highnesses, if  it appertains to the said office of Admiral, according as it was held by  Admiral Don Alfonso Enriques, and others his successors in their  districts, and if it be just. Juan de Coloma.    Item, that in all the vessels which may be equipped for the said traffic  and business, each time and whenever and as often as they may be  equipped, the said Don Cristobal Colon may, if he chooses, contribute and  pay the eighth part of all that may be spent in the equipment, and that  likewise he may have and take the eighth part of the profits that may  result from such equipment.--It so pleases their Highnesses. Juan de  Coloma.    These are granted and despatched, with the replies of Your Highnesses at  the end of each article, in the town of Santa Fe de la Vega of Granada,  on the seventeenth day of April in the year of the nativity of our  Saviour Jesus Christ, one thousand four hundred and ninety-two.

FOOTNOTES:    [77-1] The Spanish text is that printed by Navarrete in his _Coleccion de  los Viages y Descubrimientos_, etc. (Madrid, 1825), II. 7-8, and taken  from the Archives of the Duke of Veragua. The translation is that of  George F. Barwick printed by Benjamin Franklin Stevens in his  _Christopher Columbus His Own Book of Privileges_, 1502, etc. (London,  1893), pp. 42-45, with such slight changes (chiefly of tenses) as were  necessary to bring it into conformity with the text of Navarrete. This  document is also given in English translation in _Memorials of Columbus_  (London, 1823), pp. 40-43. That volume is a translation of G.B. Spotorno,  _Codice Diplomatico Colombo-Americano_ (Genoa, 1823).    [77-2] In this edition of the Narratives of the Voyages of Columbus his  name in the translation of the original documents will be given in the  form used in the originals. During his earlier years in Spain Columbus  was known as Colomo, the natural Spanish form corresponding to the  Italian Colombo. At some time prior to 1492 he adopted the form Colon,  apparently to make more probable his claim to be descended from a Roman  general, Colonius, and to be related to the French admiral, Coullon,  called in contemporary Italian sources Colombo, and Columbus in Latin. In  modern texts of Tacitus the Roman general's name is Cilonius, and modern  research has shown that the French admiral's real name was Caseneuve and  that Coullon was a sobriquet added for some unknown reason. On the two  French naval commanders known as Colombo or Coullon and the baselessness  of Columbus's alleged relationship see Vignaud, _Etudes Critiques sur la  Vie de Colomb_ pp. 131 ff.    [78-1] In 1497 Columbus at his own request was supplied with a copy of  the ordinances establishing the admiralty of Castile so that he might  have a documentary enumeration of his prerogatives in the Indies. This  official copy he preserved in the collection of his papers known as the  _Book of Privileges_, and the translation of the documents relating to  the Admiralty of Castile is given in Stevens's edition of the _Book of  Privileges_, pp. 14 ff. This dignity of Admiral comprised supreme or  vice-regal authority on the sea and the general range of legal  jurisdiction in determining suits of law that is enjoyed by modern courts  of admiralty. A translation of Columbus's exposition of his rights  derived from his admiralty of the islands in the Ocean may be found in  P.L. Ford, _Writings of Columbus_ (New York, 1892), pp. 177-198, taken  from _Memorials of Columbus_ (London, 1823), pp. 205-223. For a summary  of these powers _cf._ the _Titulo_ that follows.

I shall make  something of you.\"    \"I learn faster with you than with Florence,\" said Dodger.    \"Probably she would succeed better with girls, but I hold that a male  teacher is better for boys. How long are you willing to study every  day?\"    \"As long as you think best.\"    \"Then we will say from two to three hours. I think you have talent for  arithmetic. I don't expect to make you fit for a bookkeeper, but I  hope to make you equal to most office boys by the time we reach San  Francisco. What do you intend to do in California?\"    \"I don't know. I should like to go back to New York, but I shall not  have money enough.\"    \"No; twenty-five dollars would go but a little way toward the passage.  Evidently Mr. Waring did not intend to have you return, or he would  have provided you with more.\"    \"That is just why I should like to go back. I am afraid he will do  some harm to Florence.\"    \"And you would like to be on hand to protect her?\"    \"Yes.\"    Randolph Leslie smiled.    \"You seem to take a great deal of interest in Florence, if I may make  as free with her name as you do.\"    \"Yes; I do, Mr. Leslie.\"    \"If you were only a little older I might suspect the nature of that  interest.\"    \"I am older than she is.\"    \"In years, yes. But a young lady of seventeen, brought up as she has  been, is older by years than a boy of eighteen. I don't think you need  apprehend any harm to Miss Linden, except that Mr. Waring may cheat  her out of her rightful share of the inheritance. Is her uncle in good  health?\"    \"No, sir; he is a very feeble man.\"    \"Is he an old man?\"    \"Not so very old. I don't believe he is over sixty.\"    Really Mr. Linden was but fifty-four, but, being a confirmed invalid,  he looked older.    \"Should you say that he was likely to live very long?\"    \"No,\" answered Dodger. \"He looks as if you could knock him over with a  feather. Besides, I've heard Florence say that she was afraid her  uncle could not live long.\"    \"Probably Curtis Waring is counting upon this. If he can keep Florence  and her uncle apart for a few months, Mr. Linden will die, and he will  inherit the whole estate. What is this will he speaks of in the letter  you showed me?\"    \"I don't know, sir.\"    \"Whatever the provisions are, it is evident that he thinks it  important to get it into his possession. If favorable to him, he will  keep it carefully. If unfavorable, I think a man like him would not  hesitate to suppress it.\"    \"No doubt you are right, sir. I don't know much about wills,\" said  Dodger.    \"No; I suppose not. You never made any, I suppose,\" remarked the  reporter, with a smile.    \"I never had nothing to leave,\" said Dodger.    \"Anything would be a better expression. As your tutor I feel it  incumbent upon me to correct your grammar.\"    \"I wish you would, Mr. Leslie. What do you mean to do when you get to  San Francisco?\"    \"I shall seek employment on one of the San Farncisco daily papers. Six  months or a year so spent will restore my health, and enable me to  live without drawing upon my moderate savings.\"    \"I expect I shall have to work, too, to get money to take me back to  New York.\"    And now we must ask the reader to imagine four months and one week  passed.    There had been favorable weather on the whole, and the voyage was  unusually short.    Dodger and the reporter stood on deck, and with eager interest watched  the passage through the Golden Gate. A little later and the queen city  of the Pacific came in sight, crowning the hill on which a part of the  city is built, with the vast Palace Hotel a conspicuous object in the  foreground.          Chapter XXIV.  Florence In Suspense.      We must now return to New York to Dodger's old home.    When he did not return at the usual hour, neither Florence nor Mrs.  O'Keefe was particularly disturbed.    It was thought that he had gone on some errand of unusual length, and  would return an hour or two late.    Eight o'clock came, the hour at which the boy was accustomed to repair  to Florence's room to study, and still he didn't make his appearance.    \"Dodger's late this evening, Mrs. O'Keefe,\" said Florence, going up to  the room of her landlady.    \"Shure he is. It's likely he's gone to Brooklyn or up to Harlem, wid a  bundle. He'll be comin' in soon.\"    \"I hope he will be well paid for the errand, since it keeps him so  long.\"    \"I hope so, too, Florence, for he's a good boy, is Dodger. Did I tell  you how he served the rapscallion that tried to stale my apples the  other day?\"    \"No; I would like to hear it.\"    \"A big, black-bearded man came along, and asked me for an apple.    \"'You can have one for two pennies,' says I.    \"'But I haven't got them,' says he.    \"'Then you must go widout it,' says I.    \"'We'll see about that,' says he.    \"And what do you think?--the fellow picked out one of my biggest  apples, and was walkin' away! That made me mad.    \"'Come back, you thafe of the worruld!' says I.    \"'Silence, you old hag!' says he.    \"Actilly he called me an old hag! I wanted to go after him, but there  was two hoodlums hangin' round, and I knew they'd carry off some of my  apples, when, just as I was at my wits' end, Dodger came round the  corner.    \"'Dodger,' I screamed, 'go after that man! He's taken one of my  apples, widout lave or license!'    \"Upon that, Dodger, brave as a lion, walked up to the man, and, says  he:    \"'Give back that apple, or pay for it!'    \"'What's that to you, you impudent young rascal?' says the man,  raisin' the apple to his mouth. But he didn't get a chance to bite it,  for Dodger, with a flip of his hand, knocked it on the sidewalk, and  picked it up.    \"Wasn't the man mad just?\"    \"'I'll smash you, boy,' he growled.    \"'I'm a baggage-smasher myself,' says Dodger, 'and I can smash as  well as you.'    \"Wid that the man up with his fist and struck at Dodger, but he dodged  the blow, and gave him one for himself wid his right. Just then up  came a cop.    \"'What's all this?' says he.    \"'That man tried to run off wid one of my apples,' says I.    \"'Come along,' says the cop. 'You're wanted at the station-house.'    \"'It's a lie,' says the man. 'I paid the woman for the apple, and  that young rascal knocked it out of my hand.'    \"'I know the boy,' says the cop, 'and he ain't one of that kind. I'll  let you go if you buy five apples from the lady, and pay for 'em.'    \"The man made up an ugly face, but he didn't want to be locked up, and  so he paid me a dime for five apples.\"    \"Dodger is very brave,\" said Florence. \"Sometimes I think he is too  daring. He is liable to get into trouble.\"    \"If he does he'll get himself out of it, never you fear. Dodger can  take care of himself.\"    Nine o'clock came, and Florence became alarmed. She had not been aware  how much she had depended upon the company of her faithful friend,  humble as his station was.    Again she went into Mrs. O'Keefe's room. The apple-woman had been out  to buy some groceries and had just returned.    \"I am getting anxious about Dodger,\" said Florence. \"It is nine  o'clock.\"    \"And what's nine o'clock for a boy like him? Shure he's used to bein'  out at all hours of the night.\"    \"I shall feel relieved when he comes home. What should I do without  him?\"    \"Shure I'd miss him myself; but it isn't the first time he has been  out late.\"    \"Perhaps that terrible Tim Bolton has got hold of him,\" suggested  Florence.    \"Tim isn't so bad, Florence. He isn't fit company for the likes of  you, but there's worse men nor Tim.\"    \"Didn't he send out Dodger to commit a burglary?\"    \"And if he hadn't you'd never made Dodger's acquaintance.\"    \"That's true; but it doesn't make burglary any more excusable. Don't  you really think Tim Bolton has got hold of him?\"    \"If he has, he won't keep him long, I'll make oath of that. He might  keep him over night, but Dodger would come back in the morning.\"    Florence was somewhat cheered by Mrs. O'Keefe's refusal to believe  that Dodger was in any serious trouble, but she could not wholly free  herself from uneasiness. When eleven o'clock came she went to bed very  unwillingly, and got very little rest during the night. Morning came,  and still Dodger did not show up. As we know, he was fairly started on  his long voyage, though he had not yet recovered consciousness.    Florence took a very light breakfast, and at the usual time went to  Mrs. Leighton's to meet her pupil. When the study hour was over, she  did not remain to lunch, but hurried back, stopping at Mrs. O'Keefe's  apple-stand just as that lady was preparing to go home to prepare  dinner.    \"Have you seen anything of Dodger, Mrs. O'Keefe?\" asked Florence,  breathlessly.    \"No, I haven't, Florence. I've had my eye out watchin' for him, and he  hasn't showed up.\"    \"Is there anything we can do?\" asked Florence, anxiously.    \"Well, we might go around and see Tim--and find out whether he's got  hold of him.\"    \"Let us go at once.\"    \"Shure I didn't know you cared so much for the boy,\" said Mrs.  O'Keefe, with a shrewd look at Florence's anxious face.    \"Why shouldn't I care for him? He is my only friend.\"    \"Is he now? And what's the matter wid Bridget O'Keefe?\" asked the  apple-woman.    \"Excuse me, Mrs. O'Keefe. I know very well you are my friend, and a  kind friend, too. I should not have forgotten you.\"    \"It's all right, Florence. You're flustrated like, and that's why you  forget me.\"    \"I have so few friends that I can't spare one,\" continued Florence.    \"That's so. Come along wid me, and we'll see what Tim has to tell us.\"    A short walk brought the two strangely assorted companions to the  entrance of Tim Bolton's saloon. \"I'm afraid to go in, Mrs. O'Keefe,\"  said Florence.    \"Come along wid me, my dear, I won't let anything harm you. You ain't  used to such a"]]]
