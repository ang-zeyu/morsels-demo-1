A  large spreading cedar was selected as the tree which should support the  roof of our cave. It was situated on a mound at the edge of the woods.  First a passageway, or ditch, was dug at the bottom, and then we begun  tunneling in the side of the mound under the roots of the tree. For a  while the ground above held, and our tunnel had reached a length of  about four feet, when suddenly, without the slightest warning, the sandy  soil gave way and we were engulfed. Bill, who was furthest within the  cave, was almost entirely covered, while I was buried to the shoulders.  A crowd of boys came to our assistance and dug us out. Poor Bill was  almost smothered before they scooped the sand away from around his mouth  and nose. The boys made slow work of it, having to dig with their hands  and a couple of shingles, because the two spades we had were buried with  us at the bottom of the cave.    Of course, this little episode gave us a scare, but it was only  temporary. We swore every one to secrecy, so that Mr. Clark, the  principal, wouldn't hear of the mishap and suppress any further cave  building. It was obvious that the only roof we could depend on for our  cave would be a wooden roof. If we had been at Willow Clump Island we  would have gotten any amount of slabs from the lumber mills across the  river.    One of our schoolmates, a day scholar, came to the rescue. His name was  Chester Hill, a little bit of a chap, about the shortest for his age  that I have ever seen. His name was so at variance to his size that we  called him \"Hillock,\" for short. Now Hillock lived on a farm about eight  miles from school, and used to drive in every day on a farm wagon. He  had helped us dig the cave under the cedar tree, and when he learned  that we would need some lumber to build a safe cave, he told us that he  had an uncle who owned a lumber mill on the Morris River, from whom he  was sure we could get all the slabs we wanted. Of course, we were  delighted, and laid our plans for an elaborate cave house. Hillock  promised to be on hand on the following Saturday afternoon with his load  of lumber.      EXCAVATING FOR THE CAVE.    We immediately set out to make the necessary excavation. The side of a  bushy knoll was chosen as a suitable site. First we carefully  transplanted the bushes that grew in the square we had marked out for  the cave, and cutting the sod into squares, piled it all neatly to one  side. Then we shoveled away the top-soil and heaped it up for future  use. After that we dug away the sandy subsoil. The cave proper we  planned to make about 8 feet by 10 feet, with a passageway 2 feet wide  and 6 feet long, leading in from a large bush at the base of the knoll.  Our excavation was therefore somewhat T-shaped (see Fig. 182). At the  deepest part we had to dig down about 10 feet.    [Illustration: Fig. 182. Excavation for the Cave.]    [Illustration: Fig. 183. Framework of the Cave.]    The digging was all done by Saturday, when Hillock pulled up with a big  load of slabs. Slabs are a very unsatisfactory kind of wood for most  purposes. Being the outside cut, they are usually very irregular and  weak in spots. In many places they are almost clear bark. Of course, had  our pocketbooks permitted, we would have used stout scantlings for the  corner posts of our cave house and substantial boards for the walls,  roof and flooring, but we had to be content with materials at hand.  Eight of the best slabs were selected for our corner posts; four of them  we cut to the length of 8 feet and the others to a length of 6 feet. The  long slabs were set up at the rear of the cave, two at each corner, one  flat against the rear wall, with its edge buried in the corner, and the  other against the side wall, with its edge tight against the rear slab,  as in Fig. 183. The same was done at the forward corners with the  shorter slabs. A couple of slabs were now set up on each side of the  passageway, and a corresponding pair against the rear wall. The upper  and lower ends of the uprights were then connected with slabs, called  stringpieces.    [Illustration: Fig. 184. The Siding and Flooring.]    The sides were now boarded up with upright slabs nailed to the  stringpieces. An opening 3 feet 6 inches high was left in the forward  wall for a passageway. Several slabs were now placed on the edge across  the bottom of the cave, to serve as floor beams, upon which a flooring  of slabs was laid. Next the rafters were set in place, one on each  upright slab. Slots were cut in the ends of the uprights to receive the  rafters, which were slabs placed on edge. As the forward uprights were 2  feet shorter than the rear ones, the rafters were given a good slant, so  that the roof would properly shed any water that might soak in through  the ground above.    [Illustration: Fig. 185. Notching in the Rafters.]    The roof was laid on the same way that we had made the roof of our tree  house; that is, a slab was first nailed at the forward end of the  rafters with its edge projecting far enough to make a good eave; then  the second slab was nailed on, with its edge overlapping the first, and  a third with its edge overlapping the second, and so on with the rest.  At the rear end of the roof a hole was cut, into which we fitted a piece  of stovepipe. We didn't plan to have a fire in the house, but set the  stovepipe in place to provide the necessary ventilation. As the pipe had  an elbow in it, there was no danger of rain or dirt falling through it.  The upper end of the stovepipe was concealed among some rocks at the top  of the knoll.    A suitable flooring was now laid in the passageway, and the sides were  boarded up to a height of 2 feet from the floor at the entrance to a  height of 3 feet 6 inches at the inner end. A roof of slabs was nailed  on, and then we were ready to cover our slab house with dirt.      COVERING THE CAVE.    We avoided piling on the dirt very deep, because there was danger of  breaking in the roof with a heavy load. A thin layer of sand covered  with the top-soil brought up the level to about that of the rest of the  knoll. Then the sod was laid back in place and well watered, and the few  bushes planted back in their original positions. Our sodding should have  been done in the spring for best results. The frost soon killed the  grass, and the bushes withered away. But a few cents' worth of grass  seed was sowed in, and in time gave the knoll a very natural appearance.  A bush at the bottom concealed the entrance of the cave, so that no one  who was not in the secret would have suspected that beneath that  innocent looking knoll were gathered the members of the \"Big Bug Club.\"      THE BIG BUG CLUB.    [Illustration: Fig. 186. A Section through the Completed Cave.]    Of course, we had to organize a secret society, to occupy our  subterranean dwelling. In that I fear we overstepped the rules of the  school. Of course, Mr. Clark knew of our cave, in fact he visited us  there once, lowering his dignity sufficiently to squeeze into the narrow  passageway, and playing Bill a game of chess at our club table. He  seemed quite pleased with our work, and complimented us very highly on  the masterful way in which we had built the underground house. We told  him that we had organized a club of the older fellows to play indoor  games and have occasional spreads, but we did not tell him that most of  our spreads were held at the dead of night, when there was no moon and  the stars were hidden by clouds. At 10 o'clock each night the bell rang  for us to turn out our lights, and after that the six members would  each, in turn, keep a half-hour watch, that is, first one would sit up  and try to keep awake for half an hour, after which he would waken the  next fellow, who at the end of a half hour would rouse the third, and so  on, until 1 o'clock, when the sixth watcher would wake up the entire  club. Then we would all creep out the back window in the hall, onto the  roof of the rear annex of the schoolhouse, and thence climb down a rope  ladder to the ground.      MIDNIGHT BANQUETS.    I suppose we could have just as easily have tiptoed downstairs and out  the back door, but it would have spoiled the romance of it all. The  absolute stillness and the pitch-black darkness of the night were  awe-inspiring. The roll of a pebble or the crack of a twig under foot  would set us all atingle as we stole out to our cave house. Sometimes  the night was so black that we could hardly find the entrance of the  cave. Once inside, in the light of a few candles, the nervous tension  was relieved, and we reveled in a banquet of cold victuals and dainties,  purchased out of the monthly club dues. Our meetings in the cave lasted  scarcely half an hour. In fact, the meeting, and even the banquet, were  mere incidentals. The main enjoyment consisted in stealing out to the  cave and back again, always at the risk of getting caught. Usually when  we got to bed again we would be too excited to fall asleep right away,  and when we did finally drop off our sleep was so sound that several  times the breakfast bell caught one or more of us still napping.      THE CLUB PIN.    [Illustration: Fig. 187. The Club Pin.]    The only other charm our secret club afforded was the wearing of a  mysterious club pin. It was a silver beetle, with the letter G engraved  on the head and the letter B on the body, while down the center of the  back was the letter I (see Fig. 187). In public we called ourselves the  G. I. B.'s, but it was only the initiated members who knew that these  letters were to be read backward, and, with the beetle on which they  were engraved, signified the \"Big Bugs.\" Of course, we had some secret  signs and signals, a secret hand grasp, a peculiar whistle as a warning  to run, another meaning \"lie still,\" and a third signifying \"all is  well.\"      THE COMBINATION LOCK.    ["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#19)"],[1,"  Susy made a great struggle to keep her mind centered on her books, but  with all her efforts her thoughts would wander. They wandered to  Kathleen and the Wild Irish Girls' Society; they wandered to her other  schoolfellows; they wandered to the hardship of having to take care of  the shop when she wished to be otherwise employed; and finally they  settled themselves on Ruth Craven. She could not help wondering what  Ruth would do--whether she would continue to be a valuable aid to the  queen of the new society, or whether she would give them up altogether.    \"I'd almost like her not to stay with us,\" thought Susy; \"for then  perhaps Kathleen would make me her Prime Minister. I'd like that.  Kathleen is the dearest, truest, greatest lady I ever came across. She  doesn't think anything of birth, nor of those sort of tiresome  distinctions; she thinks of you for what you are worth yourself. And she  is so splendid to look at, and has such a gallant sort of way. I do  admire her just!\"    The shop-bell rang. Susy was out in a moment. A woman had called for a  penn'orth of paper and an envelope. She put down her penny on the  counter, and Susy supplied her from a special box.    \"I was in such a taking,\" said the woman. \"I just remembered at the last  moment that all the shops were shut. I don't know what I should have  done if I hadn't recalled that Mrs. Hopkins kept hers open until nine  o'clock. I am obliged to you, little girl. I have to send this letter to  my son in India, and I'd miss the mail if it wasn't posted to-night. You  couldn't now, I suppose, oblige me with a stamp.\"    \"Of course I can,\" said Susy, cheerfully. \"Mother always keeps a supply  of stamps in the till.\"    She turned to the till as she spoke, and for the first time noticed that  the drawer was open.    \"How careless of me not to have shut it!\" she thought.    It did not occur to her to examine its contents, or to suppose for a  single moment that any one had taken money out of it. She provided the  woman with a stamp, and then, shut the drawer of the till. It was now  half-past eight, and Susy determined to take the bull by the horns and  to close the shop without further ado. She sent for the little maid in  the kitchen to put up the shutters, and in a minute or two the shop was  in darkness and Susy was racing through the remainder of her lessons. It  would take her a quarter of an hour, running most of the way, to reach  the old quarry, and she must have three or four minutes to dress. She  stood up, therefore, at her work, in order, as she expressed it, to save  time. She was so occupied when her mother came in.    \"Why have you shut the shop?\" said Mrs. Hopkins in an annoyed voice. \"It  is only a very little past half-past eight, and I saw two poor women  outside. They wanted a penn'orth of paper each. They said, 'We thought  you always kept open until nine o'clock,' Now it will spread all over  the place that I shut at half-past eight. Why did you do it, Susy? It's  hard enough to make ends meet without adding any more difficulties.\"    Mrs. Hopkins stood, looking very pale and perplexed, in the parlor. Susy  glanced at her mother, and could not help reflecting that the poor woman  was fit to drop.    \"Do sit down, mother,\" she said. \"I was so distracted; I have to be a  good way from here at nine o'clock, I couldn't think whatever kept you.  I was obliged to shut the shop. I am sorry.\"    \"Well, never mind. You didn't tell me that you were going out. I wish  you wouldn't go out so much in the evening, Susy; it does make it so  hard for me. There's no one now to help me with a bit of mending, and  all your things are getting so racketed through.\"    \"What kept you, mother?\" said Susy, ignoring her mother's speech.    \"Oh, it was your aunt. She's in such a taking about little Peter; she's  quite certain he's in for measles or something worse. I'm persuaded that  it's nothing but a cold. I never saw such a muddle-headed woman as your  aunt Bessie. She hadn't a thing handy in the place. I had to stay and  see the doctor, and then to fetch the medicine myself, and then put the  child to bed. I assure you I haven't sat down since I left.\"    \"And I suppose she never thought of giving you as much as a cup of tea?\"  said Susy.    \"No,\" answered her mother; then catching sight of the teapot, she added,  \"You might have had the tea-things removed, Susy. I will make myself a  fresh cup.\"    Susy stood still for a moment. Temptation tugged at her heart. Her  mother certainly required if ever a mother did require a daughter. But  the Wild Irish Girls--surely they were pining for her in the distance!    \"I wish I could help you, mother. I would if I hadn't promised to go  out. If you will give me the latchkey I can let myself in. You needn't  wait up; I promise to lock up carefully.\"    \"Very well, dear,\" said Mrs. Hopkins.    She did not reproach Susy; that was not her way. She put a little kettle  on the gas-stove, fetched a clean cup and saucer, and presently sat down  to her belated meal.    Susy dashed upstairs. She put on her hat and jacket, snatched up a pair  of gloves, and the next moment was out of the house.    \"Free at last,\" she thought. \"But, oh, what an evening I have had! I  must say it is horrid to be poor. Now, if I was rich like Kathleen,  wouldn't I have a gay time of it? Poor dear mother should drive in a  carriage, and I'd ride on my pony by her side; and Tom should be a  public school boy. There'd be no horrid shop then, and no horrid women  coming in for ha'p'orths and penn'orths of paper.\"    But as she ran through the autumn night-air she felt that, after all,  there was something good in life. Her pulses, which had been languid  enough in the stuffy little parlor at the back of the shop, now galloped  fiercely. She arrived two or three minutes after nine, but still in  fairly good time to see a number of dark heads surrounding a bright  light. This light was caused by two lamps which had been placed on the  ground in the old quarry; Kathleen had brought them herself in a hamper.  She had managed to buy them that day, and had smuggled them off without  any one being the wiser. A large bottle of crystalline oil accompanied  the lamps. Kathleen, who had dressed lamps for pleasure at home, knew  quite well how to manage them, and when Susy appeared they stood at each  end of a wide patch of light. Kathleen herself was in the midst of the  light, and the other girls clustered round the edge.    \"Isn't it scrumptious?\" said Kate Rourke.--\"Oh, is that you, Susy  Hopkins? You are late.\"    \"Yes, I know I am. It's a wonder I could come at all,\" said Susy.    \"Ruth Craven hasn't come yet,\" said another voice.    \"Yes, here she is,\" cried a third, and Ruth came and stood at the edge  of the patch of light.    Kathleen flung off her hat, and the light from the lamps lit up her  brilliant hair. Her cheeks were flaming with color, and her very  dark-blue eyes looked as black as night. She faced her companions.    \"Well,\" she said, \"here we are, and we call ourselves the Wild Irish  Girls. I really wonder if you English girls who are assembled here in  the old quarry to-night have the least idea what it means to be a wild  Irish girl. If you don't know, I'd like to tell you.\"    \"Yes, do tell us,\" cried several.    \"The principal thing that it means,\" continued Kathleen, raising her  voice to a slightly theatrical pitch, and extending her arm so that the  lamplight fell all over it--\"the chief thing that it means is to be  free--yes, free as the air, free as the mountain streams, free as the  dear, darling, glorious, everlasting mountains themselves. Oh, to know  freedom and then to be torn away from it! Girls, I will tell you the  truth. I feel in your dull old England as though I were in prison. Yes,  that's about it. I don't like England. I want you girls to join me in  loving Ireland.\"    \"But we can't hate England,\" said Kate Rourke; \"that is quite  impossible. If Ireland is your native land, England is ours, and we  cannot help loving her very, very much.\"    \"You have never known Ireland,\" continued Kathleen. \"You are not cramped  up in that favored spot; you are allowed to get up when you like and to  go to bed when you like, to eat what you like, to read what books you  like, to row on the lake, to shoot in the bogs, to gallop on your pony  over the moors, and--and--oh, to live the life of the _free_.\"    It was Ruth Craven who now interrupted the eager words of the queen of  the new society.    \"Can't you tell us, Kathleen,\" she said, \"how to get Ireland into  England--how to introduce what is good of Ireland into England? That is  the use of the society as far as I am concerned. With the exception of  yourself we are all English girls.\"    \"Yes,\" said Susy suddenly; \"and we have very bad times most of us. I  wish you knew what a dull evening I have just been living  through--taking care of a tiny, very dull little shop. Mother was out  looking after a sick child, and I had to mind the shop. Poor women came  in for penn'orths of paper. I can tell you there wasn't much freedom  about that; it was all horrid.\"    \"Well, we have shops in Ireland too,\" continued Kathleen, \"and I  suppose people have to mind them. But what I want to say now is this. I  have been sent over to this country to learn. My aunt Katie  O'Flynn--she's the finest figure of a woman you ever laid eyes  on--thought that I ought to have learning; mother thought so too, but  the dad didn't much care. However, I needn't worry you about that. I  have been sent here, and here I am. When I came to your wonderful school  and looked all around me, I said to myself, 'If I'm not to have  companions, why, I'll die; the heart of Kathleen O'Hara will be broken.  Now, who amongst the schoolgirls will suit me? I saw that very dull  Cassandra Weldon, and I noticed a few companions of hers who were much  the same sort. Then I observed dear, pretty little Ruth Craven,"]]]
