I have been reading it in the prophets only  today.\"    \"Have you only just heard of that?\" asked Ezra sourly.    \"No,\" replied the boy hotly. \"I have heard my mother tell of it ever  since I can remember, and I have read it over and over again. Samuel!\"    \"Yes, Dahvid?\"    \"Do you think we shall ever see the promised King?\"    \"I do not know, my boy,\" the older man answered sadly. \"We have waited  long, and there seems little hope for Israel now. But he will come  some day, he will come some day. Why do you ask, Dahvid?\"    \"I cannot tell. It is often in my mind. Something makes me think of it  tonight. Perhaps it is because I read of him today. Samuel, I would  walk to the end of the earth to see the Christ-child.\"    \"Well, you need not start now,\" grumbled Ezra, and Joel added roughly,  \"Go to sleep, boy, the hour is late.\"    It was much later before Dahvid fell asleep, for his head was full of  dreams, and the stories of wonderful days to come that his mother had  told him. But at length he joined the rest in healthy slumber.    Suddenly it seemed to each of them that something had passed over him,  and touched him lightly on the cheek. The older men raised themselves  on their elbows, but Dahvid sprang to his feet. At first they saw only  a great light, which nearly blinded them, then they discerned a  shining form in the sky, and heard a voice saying: \"Be not afraid; for  behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all  the people; for there is born to you this day in the city of David a  Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this is the sign unto you: Ye  shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.\"    And then all the sky was full of light, and the air was full of  heavenly voices, singing, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth  peace, good will toward men.\"    While the shepherds listened, half joyful, half afraid, the light  faded and the voices floated away--\"Good will to men--to men--to men,\"  and all was still as before. For a moment the shepherds looked at each  other in silent awe and wonder. Then Ezra spoke in a voice dry with  fear. \"What was it?\"    Dahvid stood speechless, and Samuel answered reverently, \"Angels.\"    \"Brothers,\" he continued, \"a wonderful thing has happened to us. It  has been a long, long day since angels have spoken to men.\"    Then he girded his shepherd's cloak about him and seized his staff.  \"Come, Ezra, Joel, Dahvid, let us be going.\"    \"Going--where?\" asked Ezra and Joel.    \"Why, to Bethlehem to see the Child. Did not the angel tell us the  sign? Let us go at once to find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes  and lying in a manger.\"    \"There be many mangers in Bethlehem,\" objected Ezra.    \"I know not how we shall find him,\" said Joel. \"It is a vain search, I  fear,\" and he drew his cloak about him and reached for his staff, \"but  I will go with you if you say.\"    So they started, Samuel, Ezra, and Joel--but Dahvid stood still.    \"Come, Dahvid, make haste!\" called Samuel.    But the boy did not move.    \"I cannot go,\" he said.    \"Cannot go!\" cried Samuel in amazement; and Ezra added, \"Who said but  a little while ago that he would go to the end of the earth to see the  King?\"    \"And so I would,\" cried Dahvid; \"but the sheep--we cannot leave the  sheep alone.\"    \"The sheep will be safe enough,\" said Samuel. \"The dogs will keep them  together. There are no wolves tonight. Come, Dahvid.\"    But the boy was firm. \"There is my master; he'll be angry if I leave  his flocks alone.\"    \"Old Abraham will never know,\" said Joel.    \"Abraham is a hard master,\" said Dahvid. \"Many a time I have felt his  heavy staff on my back. But it is not that which keeps me. I have  given him my word that, come day, come night, come life, come death, I  will not fail to keep the flocks. Go on without me; I must keep my  word. Go on.\"    So they went on, impatient and eager for this wondrous quest, Ezra  and Joel muttering now and then at the obstinacy of the boy, but  Samuel full of glowing admiration. Dahvid watched them as they moved  up the hill. That dream of finding the Christ-child--how could he give  it up? Once he started forward: \"I will go!\" But something held him  back, and he threw himself on the ground and kept back tears of bitter  disappointment. After a time he grew calmer, and found a certain  comfort in thinking of the helplessness of his flock.    Suddenly the low growling of his dog brought him to his feet. But he  saw nothing, heard nothing, and bade the dog be still. In a moment,  with a bark of alarm, the dog was up again and away. Dahvid sprang up,  certain now that danger was near. There was panic in the flock. Toward  the wilderness he could see lean, gray forms, moving stealthily and  swiftly among the sheep. Wolves! Springing upon a rock, and waving his  cloak in circles about his head, he uttered the familiar call which  gathered the sheep about him, his own sheep nearest, and behind them  the flocks of Samuel, Ezra, and Joel. The wolves made off and Dahvid  quickly looked over his flock to see if all were there--for the  Eastern shepherd knows his sheep by name.    One by one he named them, with an increasing feeling of relief. They  were all there. No! One was missing--Ke-barbara, the pet of the flock.  Ke-barbara means striped, and the little sheep was so called because  of the dark marking of her fleece. After waving his staff over the  huddled beasts, and uttering a few times the soothing cry, \"Hoo-o-o,  ta-a-a! hoo-o-o, ta-a-a!\" he rushed off in the direction which the  wolves had taken. At the top of the steep bank, at the edge of the  pasture, he stopped and called, \"Ke-barbara! Ke-barbara!\" and for  answer heard an anguished bleat from the rocks below.    It was a steep and slippery way, but Dahvid plunged down with no  thought of anything but the sheep. Loose stones gave way and he lost  his footing. At the bottom he picked himself up unhurt, and there  beside him were two wolves quarreling over the wounded sheep. One of  them slunk away at sight of the boy, but the other had a taste of  blood and sprang at Dahvid, missing his throat but sinking his teeth  into his leg. Then Dahvid, as the beast turned to spring again, struck  him a heavy blow on the head with his staff and killed him. His own  wounds were bleeding and painful, but he turned at once with caressing  words to the sheep.    \"Ke-barbara, they have hurt you, little sheep! But they have not  killed you! I reached you just in time. You cannot walk; can you? And  I am afraid I cannot carry you. But I can help. There, put your head  on my arm.\" He groaned with pain. \"No, the other one.\" So he talked to  her, as to a child, as the wounded boy and the wounded sheep slowly  made their way up the steep hillside and over the rough rocks. It was  not a long way, and, half an hour before, the sturdy shepherd lad  would have bounded over it quickly enough. But now the wounded leg was  slow, the wounded arm was weak, and the wounded lamb seemed very  heavy. It was a weary journey, with many stops. When at last they  reached the flock, still huddled trembling together, Dahvid had only  strength to give one reassuring \"Hoo-o-o, ta-a-a,\" then fell  exhausted.    How long he lay there he did not know, but the dawn was growing  bright when three men appeared from the direction of the town. It was  not the shepherds, but old Abraham and two of his servants. As the old  man caught sight of his flock, but he saw no shepherd, he raged with  anger. \"Dahvid!\" he shouted fiercely. \"Dahvid!\" There was no answer.    \"The young vagabond! He has left the sheep. Of great worth are his  promises! He would keep my flock. 'Come life--come death!' Dahvid! Let  me once find him and I will give him something he will remember longer  than he does his vows.\"    As he drew near the flock he discovered the boy lying on the ground.  \"Ah, asleep is he? and the sun this high! Come, get up!\" he shouted  fiercely, and lifted his staff to strike. But, as he did so he caught  sight of the white face and the bleeding arm, and noticed the wounded  sheep. Old Abraham dropped his angry arm, and there was a touch of  tenderness that was strange to him, as he continued: \"Ah, Dahvid, boy!  You did not forget your promises; did you, Dahvid? And I would have  struck you! Forgive me, my lad.\" Then, turning to his servants, he  gave them command: \"Take him to the inn and bid them care for him. I,  myself, will keep the flock today.\"    The servants bowed low, \"The inn is full, my lord.\"    Old Abraham commanded again positively, \"Take him to the inn, I say.\"    \"But the inn is full, my lord,\" replied the older servant, trembling.    Then the other servant spoke, \"There is perhaps room in the stable, my  lord.\"    \"Then bear him thither, and bid them give him the best of care. Go at  once.\"    So the servants bore Dahvid away, still unconscious from his wounds  and made him comfortable on a bed of straw in the stable of the inn.    It was some hours before he came to himself. When at last he opened  his eyes, and his ears began to catch once more the sounds about him,  the first thing he heard was a faint cry.    \"What is that?\" he asked eagerly of Samuel, who was watching beside  him.    \"That,\" said the old shepherd, in tones of mingled joy and reverence,  \"is the Child the angels told us about, the Child we came to see. We  found him here in the stable, in a manger.\"    \"And I am not to see him?\"    \"Yes, you are,\" said Samuel, and a grave-faced man brought the Child  and laid Him in Dahvid's arms, the Child for whose coming the people  had been longing for a thousand years.           *       *       *       *       *    The color"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#19)"],[1,"not as if the circumstance were in the least  extraordinary [_Herodotus_ ii. 148.]]    127. Now, where the roof was thus a place of frequent resort, there  could be no more useful decoration than a balustrade; nor one more  appropriate or beautiful than occasional statues in attitudes of  watchfulness, expectation, or observation: and even now, wherever the  roof is flat, we have an idea of convenience and facility of access,  which still renders the balustrade agreeable, and the statue beautiful,  if well designed. It must not be a figure of perfect peace or repose;  far less should it be in violent action: but it should be fixed in that  quick, startled stillness, which is the result of intent observation or  expectation, and which seems ready to start into motion every instant.  Its height should be slightly colossal, as it is always to be seen  against the sky; and its draperies should not be too heavy, as the eye  will always expect them to be caught by the wind. We shall enter into  this subject, however, more fully hereafter. We only wish at present to  vindicate from the charge of impropriety one of the chief features of  the Italian villa. Its white figures, always marble, remain entirely  unsullied by the weather, and stand out with great majesty against the  blue air behind them, taking away from the heaviness, without destroying  the simplicity, of the general form.    128. It seems then that, by its form and details, the villa of the Lago  di Como attains so high a degree of elevation of character, as not only  brings it into harmony of its _locus_, without any assistance from  appearance of antiquity, but may, we think, permit it to dispense even  with solidity of material, and appear in light summer stucco, instead of  raising itself in imperishable marble. And this conclusion, which is  merely theoretical, is verified by fact: for we remember no instance,  except in cases where poverty had overpowered pretension, or decay had  turned rejoicing into silence, in which the lightness of the material  was offensive to the feelings; in all cases, it is agreeable to the eye.  Where it is allowed to get worn, and discolored, and broken, it induces  a wretched mockery of the dignified form which it preserves; but, as  long as it is renewed at proper periods, and watched over by the eye of  its inhabitant, it is an excellent and easily managed medium of effect.    129. With all the praise, however, which we have bestowed upon it, we do  not say that the villa of the Larian Lake is perfection; indeed we  cannot say so, until we have compared it with a few other instances,  chiefly to be found in Italy, on whose soil we delay, as being the  native country of the villa, properly so-called, and as ever yet being  almost the only spot of Europe where any good specimens of it are to be  found; for we do not understand by the term \"villa\" a cubic erection,  with one window on each side of a verdant door, and three on the second  and uppermost story, such as the word suggests to the fertile  imagination of ruralizing cheesemongers; neither do we understand the  quiet and unpretending country house of a respectable gentleman; neither  do we understand such a magnificent mass of hereditary stone as  generally forms the autumn retreat of an English noble; but we  understand the light but elaborate summer habitation, raised however and  wherever it pleases his fancy, by some individual of great wealth and  influence, who can enrich it with every attribute of beauty; furnish it  with every appurtenance of pleasure; and repose in it with the dignity  of a mind trained to exertion or authority. Such a building could not  exist in Greece, where every district a mile and a quarter square was  quarreling with all its neighbors. It could exist, and did exist, in  Italy, where the Roman power secured tranquillity, and the Roman  constitution distributed its authority among a great number of  individuals, on whom, while it raised them to a position of great  influence, and, in its later times, of wealth, it did not bestow the  power of raising palaces or private fortresses. The villa was their  peculiar habitation, their only resource, and a most agreeable one;  because the multitudes of the kingdom being, for a long period, confined  to a narrow territory, though ruling the world, rendered the population  of the city so dense, as to drive out its higher ranks to the  neighboring hamlets of Tibur and Tusculum.    130. In other districts of Europe the villa is not found, because in  very perfect monarchies, as in Austria, the power is thrown chiefly into  the hands of a few, who build themselves palaces, not villas; and in  perfect republics, as in Switzerland, the power is so split among the  multitude, that nobody can build himself anything. In general, in  kingdoms of great extent, the country house becomes the permanent and  hereditary habitation; and the villas are all crowded together, and form  gingerbread rows in the environs of the capital; and, in France and  Germany, the excessively disturbed state of affairs in the Middle Ages  compelled every baron or noble to defend himself, and retaliate on his  neighbors as he best could, till the villa was lost in the chateau and  the fortress; and men now continue to build as their forefathers built  (and long may they do so), surrounding the domicile of pleasure with a  moat and a glacis, and guarding its garret windows with turrets and  towers: while, in England, the nobles, comparatively few, and of great  power, inhabit palaces, not villas; and the rest of the population is  chiefly crowded into cities, in the activity of commerce, or dispersed  over estates in that of agriculture; leaving only one grade of gentry,  who have neither the taste to desire, nor the power to erect, the villa,  properly so-called.    131. We must not, therefore, be surprised if, on leaving Italy, where  the crowd of poverty-stricken nobility can still repose their pride in  the true villa, we find no farther examples of it worthy of  consideration; though we hope to have far greater pleasure in  contemplating its substitutes, the chateau and the fortress. We must be  excused, therefore, for devoting one paper more to the state of villa  architecture in Italy; after which we shall endeavor to apply the  principles we shall have deduced to the correction of some abuses in the  erection of English country houses, in cases where scenery would demand  beauty of design and wealth permit finish of decoration.          III.    THE ITALIAN VILLA (Concluded).      132. We do not think there is any truth in the aphorism, now so  frequently advanced in England, that the adaptation of shelter to the  corporal comfort of the human race is the original and true end of the  art of architecture, properly so-called: for, were such the case, he  would be the most distinguished architect who was best acquainted with  the properties of cement, with the nature of stone, and the various  durability of wood. That such knowledge is necessary to the perfect  architect we do not deny; but it is no more the end and purpose of his  application, than a knowledge of the alphabet is the object of the  refined scholar, or of rhythm of the inspired poet.    133. For, supposing that we were for a moment to consider that we built  a house _merely_ to be lived in, and that the whole bent of our  invention, in raising the edifice, is to be directed to the provision of  comfort for the life to be spent therein; supposing that we build it  with the most perfect dryness and coolness of cellar, the most luxurious  appurtenances of pantry; that we build our walls with the most compacted  strength of material, the most studied economy of space; that we leave  not a chink in the floor for a breath of wind to pass through, not a  hinge in the door, which, by any possible exertion of its irritable  muscles, could creak; that we elevate our chambers into exquisite  coolness, furnish them with every attention to the maintenance of  general health, as well as the prevention of present inconvenience: to  do all this, we must be possessed of great knowledge and various skill;  let this knowledge and skill be applied with the greatest energy, and  what have they done? Exactly as much as brute animals can do by mere  instinct; nothing more than bees and beavers, moles and magpies, ants  and earwigs, do every day of their lives, without the slightest effort  of reason; we have made ourselves superior as architects to the most  degraded animation of the universe, only insomuch as we have lavished  the highest efforts of intellect, to do what they have done with the  most limited sensations that can constitute life.    134. The mere preparation of convenience, therefore, is not architecture  in which man can take pride, or ought to take delight;[21] but the high  and ennobling art of architecture is that of giving to buildings, whose  parts are determined by necessity, such forms and colors as shall  delight the mind, by preparing it for the operations to which it is to  be subjected in the building: and thus, as it is altogether to the mind  that the work of the architect is addressed, it is not as a part of his  art, but as a limitation of its extent, that he must be acquainted with  the minor principles of the economy of domestic erections. For this  reason, though we shall notice every class of edifice, it does not come  within our proposed plan, to enter into any detailed consideration of  the inferior buildings of each class, which afford no scope for the play  of the imagination by their nature or size; but we shall generally  select the most perfect and beautiful examples, as those in which alone  the architect has the power of fulfilling the high purposes of his art.  In the villa, however, some exception must be made, inasmuch as it will  be useful, and perhaps interesting, to arrive at some fixed conclusions  respecting the modern"]]]
