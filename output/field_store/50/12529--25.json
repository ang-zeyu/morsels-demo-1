He saw that there was one instrument,  and only one, by which his vast and daring projects could be carried  into execution. That instrument was a standing army. To the forming of  such an army, therefore, he directed all the energy of his strong mind.  In Ireland, where he was viceroy, he actually succeeded in establishing  a military despotism, not only over the aboriginal population, but also  over the English colonists, and was able to boast that, in that island,  the King was as absolute as any prince in the whole world could be. [13]    The ecclesiastical administration was, in the meantime, principally  directed by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. Of all the prelates  of the Anglican Church, Laud had departed farthest from the principles  of the Reformation, and had drawn nearest to Rome. His theology was more  remote than even that of the Dutch Arminians from the theology of the  Calvinists. His passion for ceremonies, his reverence for holidays,  vigils, and sacred places, his ill concealed dislike of the marriage  of ecclesiastics, the ardent and not altogether disinterested zeal  with which he asserted the claims of the clergy to the reverence of the  laity, would have made him an object of aversion to the Puritans, even  if he had used only legal and gentle means for the attainment of his  ends. But his understanding was narrow; and his commerce with the world  had been small. He was by nature rash, irritable, quick to feel for his  own dignity, slow to sympathise with the sufferings of others, and prone  to the error, common in superstitious men, of mistaking his own peevish  and malignant moods for emotions of pious zeal. Under his direction  every corner of the realm was subjected to a constant and minute  inspection. Every little congregation of separatists was tracked out and  broken up. Even the devotions of private families could not escape the  vigilance of his spies. Such fear did his rigour inspire that the  deadly hatred of the Church, which festered in innumerable bosoms, was  generally disguised under an outward show of conformity. On the very eve  of troubles, fatal to himself and to his order, the Bishops of several  extensive dioceses were able to report to him that not a single  dissenter was to be found within their jurisdiction. [14]    The tribunals afforded no protection to the subject against the civil  and ecclesiastical tyranny of that period. The judges of the common  law, holding their situations during the pleasure of the King, were  scandalously obsequious. Yet, obsequious as they were, they were less  ready and less efficient instruments of arbitrary power than a class of  courts, the memory of which is still, after the lapse of more than two  centuries, held in deep abhorrence by the nation. Foremost among  these courts in power and in infamy were the Star Chamber and the High  Commission, the former a political, the latter a religious inquisition.  Neither was a part of the old constitution of England. The Star Chamber  had been remodelled, and the High Commission created, by the Tudors. The  power which these boards had possessed before the accession of Charles  had been extensive and formidable, but had been small indeed when  compared with that which they now usurped. Guided chiefly by the violent  spirit of the primate, and free from the control of Parliament, they  displayed a rapacity, a violence, a malignant energy, which had been  unknown to any former age. The government was able through their  instrumentality, to fine, imprison, pillory, and mutilate without  restraint. A separate council which sate at York, under the presidency  of Wentworth, was armed, in defiance of law, by a pure act of  prerogative, with almost boundless power over the northern counties. All  these tribunals insulted and defied the authority of Westminster Hall,  and daily committed excesses which the most distinguished Royalists have  warmly condemned. We are informed by Clarendon that there was hardly  a man of note in the realm who had not personal experience of the  harshness and greediness of the Star Chamber, that the High Commission  had so conducted itself that it had scarce a friend left in the kingdom,  and that the tyranny of the Council of York had made the Great Charter a  dead letter on the north of the Trent.    The government of England was now, in all points but one, as despotic as  that of France. But that one point was all important. There was still no  standing army. There was therefore, no security that the whole fabric  of tyranny might not be subverted in a single day; and, if taxes were  imposed by the royal authority for the support of an army, it was  probable that there would be an immediate and irresistible explosion.  This was the difficulty which more than any other perplexed Wentworth.  The Lord Keeper Finch, in concert with other lawyers who were employed  by the government, recommended an expedient which was eagerly adopted.  The ancient princes of England, as they called on the inhabitants of the  counties near Scotland to arm and array themselves for the defence of  the border, had sometimes called on the maritime counties to furnish  ships for the defence of the coast. In the room of ships money had  sometimes been accepted. This old practice it was now determined, after  a long interval, not only to revive but to extend. Former princes had  raised shipmoney only in time of war: it was now exacted in a time of  profound peace. Former princes, even in the most perilous wars, had  raised shipmoney only along the coasts: it was now exacted from the  inland shires. Former princes had raised shipmoney only for the maritime  defence of the country: It was now exacted, by the admission of the  Royalists themselves. With the object, not of maintaining a navy, but  of furnishing the King with supplies which might be increased at  his discretion to any amount, and expended at his discretion for any  purpose.    The whole nation was alarmed and incensed. John Hampden, an opulent and  well born gentleman of Buckinghamshire, highly considered in his own  neighbourhood, but as yet little known to the kingdom generally, had the  courage to step forward, to confront the whole power of the government,  and take on himself the cost and the risk of disputing the prerogative  to which the King laid claim. The case was argued before the judges  in the Exchequer Chamber. So strong were the arguments against the  pretensions of the crown that, dependent and servile as the judges were,  the majority against Hampden was the smallest possible. Still there was  a majority. The interpreters of the law had pronounced that one great  and productive tax might be imposed by the royal authority. Wentworth  justly observed that it was impossible to vindicate their judgment  except by reasons directly leading to a conclusion which they had not  ventured to draw. If money might legally be raised without the consent  of Parliament for the support of a fleet, it was not easy to deny that  money might, without consent of Parliament, be legally raised for the  support of an army.    The decision of the judges increased the irritation of the people. A  century earlier, irritation less serious would have produced a general  rising. But discontent did not now so readily as in an earlier age take  the form of rebellion. The nation had been long steadily advancing in  wealth and in civilisation. Since the great northern Earls took up arms  against Elizabeth seventy years had elapsed; and during those seventy  years there had been no civil war. Never, during the whole existence  of the English nation, had so long a period passed without intestine  hostilities. Men had become accustomed to the pursuits of peaceful  industry, and, exasperated as they were, hesitated long before they drew  the sword.    This was the conjuncture at which the liberties of the nation were in  the greatest peril. The opponents of the government began to despair of  the destiny of their country; and many looked to the American wilderness  as the only asylum in which they could enjoy civil and spiritual  freedom. There a few resolute Puritans, who, in the cause of their  religion, feared neither the rage of the ocean nor the hardships of  uncivilised life, neither the fangs of savage beasts nor the tomahawks  of more savage men, had built, amidst the primeval forests, villages  which are now great and opulent cities, but which have, through  every change, retained some trace of the character derived from their  founders. The government regarded these infant colonies with aversion,  and attempted violently to stop the stream of emigration, but could not  prevent the population of New England from being largely recruited by  stouthearted and Godfearing men from every part of the old England.  And now Wentworth exulted in the near prospect of Thorough. A few years  might probably suffice for the execution of his great design. If  strict economy were observed, if all collision with foreign powers were  carefully avoided, the debts of the crown would be cleared off: there  would be funds available for the support of a large military force; and  that force would soon break the refractory spirit of the nation.    At this crisis an act of insane bigotry suddenly changed the whole  face of public affairs. Had the King been wise, he would have pursued a  cautious and soothing policy towards Scotland till he was master in the  South. For Scotland was of all his kingdoms that in which there was the  greatest risk that a spark might produce a flame, and that a flame might  become a conflagration. Constitutional opposition, indeed, such as he  had encountered at Westminster, he had not to apprehend at Edinburgh.  The Parliament of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#19)"],[1,"dismissed, put under arrest, and made to surrender some of his  ill-gotten wealth. An inadequate idea may be formed of the want  of supervision which characterized Shah Alam's reign, by  observing that this man, who had not been more than two years in  charge of the collections of a small and impoverished district,  disgorged, in all, no less than fifteen lakhs of rupees. He was  succeeded in his appointment by Abdul Ahid Khan (who bears  henceforth the title of Majad-ud-daulah), while Manzur Ali Khan,  another nominee of the minister's, became Vazir, or Controller of  the Household. Of these two officers it is only necessary here to  observe, that after events showed the former Â— who was a Musalman  native of Kashmir Â— as a character marked by the faithlessness  and want of manly spirit for which the people of that country are  proverbial in India. The latter was to turn out either a very  blundering politician, or a very black-hearted traitor.    Title and lucrative office were now conferred upon the  Kashmirian, Abdul Ahid, whose pliant manners soon enabled him to  secure a complete influence over his indolent master. Najaf Khan  seems to have been equally deceived at the time; but after-events  showed the difference between the undeceiving of a worn-out  voluptuary, and that of a nature unsuspicious from its own  goodness.    Such were the first fruits of Najaf's alliance with the Viceroy  of Audh; the price was to be paid in the bestowal of the Imperial  sanction upon the final destruction of the Rohilla Pathans. It  has been already seen how this province, which ran up between the  personal domains of the crown and the fief of the Viceroy of  Audh, had been seized, first by Ali Mohammad, and latterly by his  son's guardian, the Protector Rahmat Khan. But ever since Ali  Mohammad's wars with the late Vazir, Safdar Jang, the rulers of  Audh had probably coveted the province, and the retreat of the  Mahrattas and their occupation in domestic pursuits in the Deccan  afforded just the occasion for which Shujaa-ud-daula was waiting.  Much eloquent indignation has been vented by Macaulay and Mill on  the subject of the accession to this campaign of the British  Governor, Mr. Hastings. As I am not writing a history of British  administration, I shall only observe that the Emperor, whose  servants the British professed themselves, had conferred the  authority usurped by Rahmat Khan upon the Vazir, with whom they  had been for some years in alliance. As allies of both parties  they were clearly at liberty to throw in their help against the  common enemies of both, especially when these chanced to be their  own enemies also. The Mahrattas were the foes of all rulers on  that side of India; and the Rohillas were either in collusion  with the Mahrattas or unable to oppose them. It was essential, if  not to the safety of the possessions of the Vazir-Viceroy, at  least to British interests in Bengal, that a band of faithless  usurpers should not be allowed to hold a country which they could  not, or would not, prevent from affording a high road for the  Mahrattas at all seasons of the year. That view, perhaps,  commended itself to the House of Lords when they finally  acquitted Mr. Hastings, after a protracted trial, in which some  of the ablest of the Whig orators had been engaged against the  accused. It is easy for historians, writing long after the  passions, the temptations, the necessities of the moment have  ceased to press, to criticize the acts of the past by the \"dry  light\" of pure reason and abstract morality. But the claims of  necessity should not be ignored in delivering what is intended to  form a sort of judicial award.    It is perhaps a mark of the good sense and justice of the English  nation that, when they had considered the matter calmly, they  should have come to the conclusion that to condemn Hastings would  be to condemn their own existence in India. Such a conclusion  would logically require their retirement from the country _ a  step they did not feel at all called upon to take. This appears  the moral of the acquittal. Even Macaulay, who objects to the  decision of the Peers acquitting Hastings as inadmissible at the  bar of history nevertheless confesses that it was generally  approved by the nation. At all events, this particular affair was  dropped out of the charges even before the impeachment began.    But, however important to the existence of the British in India  might be the possession of this frontier territory by the  strongest ally they could secure, the conduct of the Emperor (or  rather of Mirza Najaf, in whose hands he was not quite a free  agent) remains the special subject of inquiry in this place. I  think, however, that both the minister and his master were quite  justified in wishing to transfer the province of Rohilkand from  the hands of Rahmat to those of the Vazir. It has been already  seen that the Pathan usurpers of that province had always been  foes of the Moghul power, since the first rebellion of Ali  Mohammad, with the solitary exception of the campaign of 1761,  when they joined their Abdali kinsman at Panipat. It has also  been seen that the fords by which the Ganges could be crossed in  the cold weather were in their country, but that they could never  hold them; and that, lastly, they were known to have been lately  in treaty with the Mahrattas, without reference to the interests  of the Empire. Eastern politicians are not usually or especially  scrupulous; but, when it is remembered that the Rohillas were  feudatories who had neither the will nor the power to be  faithful, it must follow that here were substantial  considerations of vital importance to the Dehli Government,  sufficient to give them a fair inducement to sanction the  enterprise of one who was their chief minister and most powerful  supporter.    Of Shujaa's own motives there is not so much palliation to offer.  He had often received aid from the Rohillas, and was under  personal obligations to them, which ought to have obliterated all  earlier memories of a hostile character; and, whatever grounds  the Emperor may have had for consenting to an attack upon the  Pathans, or the British for aiding the same, none such are likely  to have seriously actuated the Vazir in his individual character.  If he thought the Rohillas were inclined to negotiate with the  Mahrattas, he must have seen how those negotiations had been  broken off the instant he came to their assistance; and if he  wished to command the movements of the Mahrattas, he might first  have endeavoured to strengthen the hands of the Imperial  Government, and to cordially carry out his share of the treaty of  1772.    It must, however, be added Â— although the Vazir's character was  not such as to render him altogether entitled to such  justifications Â— that the latter of those engagements had been  better fulfilled by himself than by the Pathans. For while, on  the one hand, he had driven the Mahrattas out of the country, the  Protector Rahmat Khan, on his part, had neither collected the  wage of that service from the other chiefs, nor paid it himself.  Moreover, the Vazir's proceedings were only directed against the  usurping Protector and his actual adherents; and he was joined by  Zabita and some Rohilla chiefs, while others, among whom were the  sons of the late Dundi Khan, held aloof altogether, and Faizula  Khan, the son of the first founder of the Rohilla power, Ali  Mohammad, and in every way the most respectable of the clan,  though he would not desert an old friend in his hour of need, yet  strongly disapproved of his proceedings, and urged him to fulfil  his compact and pay the Vazir's claim. The bribe by which Zabita  had been detached from the confederacy, was an assignment of the  district in the neighbourhood of Meerut, which had cleared itself  of Mahratta occupation under the late Vazir's rule.    1774. Â— In October, 1773, the fort of Etawa fell, and the last  Mahratta forces were driven from the Doab. The next two or three  months were occupied in vain negotiations on the part of the  Vazir with the Rohillas; and in more serious combinations with  the Imperial Government, and with the British. And in January,  1774, the allied armies moved forward. On the 12th of April the  British entered Rohilkand; the Protector, when finally summoned  to pay what he owed, having replied by a levee en masse of all  who would obey his summons. At the same time, the Emperor ordered  out a column which he accompanied for a few marches; and issued  patents confirming the Vazir Shujaa-ud-daula in his Doab  conquests, as also in the grant already made by the British of  Korah and Allahabad. This latter circumstance removes all ground  for calling in question the cession of those provinces by their  temporary masters, and shows that the Emperor was conscious of  his own inability to hold them, or to grant them to enemies of  Audh and of England.    On the 23rd of the same month (April) the British army completely  surprised the camp of the Protector, who was defeated and slain,  after a brave but brief resistance at Kattra. Faizula was  pardoned and maintained in his own patrimonial fief of Rampur  (still held by his descendants), while the rest of the province  was occupied, with but little further trouble, by the Vazir, in  strict conformity to an Imperial firman to that effect.    The army of the Empire, under Mirza Najaf Khan, the Deputy Vazir,  had not arrived in time to participate actively in this brief  campaign; but the Vazir acknowledged the importance of the moral  support that he had received from the Empire by remitting to  court a handsome fine, on his investiture with the administration  of the conquered territory. He also gave the Mirza some  reinforcement, to aid him in his pending operations against the  Jats of Bhartpur. Zabita Khan was at the same time expelled from  his lately acquired fief at Meerut, but was"]]]
