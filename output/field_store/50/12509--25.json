Gi' us one!\"    Already she was feeling for the old, squashed, black leather purse.    \"Well, what'll you give your gran?\"    He gave a shy little laugh and pressed closer. She felt his eyelid  quivering against her cheek. \"I ain't got nothing,\" he murmured...    The old woman sprang up, seized the iron kettle off the gas stove and  took it over to the sink. The noise of the water drumming in the  kettle deadened her pain, it seemed. She filled the pail, too, and the  washing-up bowl.    It would take a whole book to describe the state of that kitchen. During  the week the literary gentleman \"did\" for himself. That is to say, he  emptied the tea leaves now and again into a jam jar set aside for that  purpose, and if he ran out of clean forks he wiped over one or two  on the roller towel. Otherwise, as he explained to his friends, his  \"system\" was quite simple, and he couldn't understand why people made  all this fuss about housekeeping.    \"You simply dirty everything you've got, get a hag in once a week to  clean up, and the thing's done.\"    The result looked like a gigantic dustbin. Even the floor was littered  with toast crusts, envelopes, cigarette ends. But Ma Parker bore him no  grudge. She pitied the poor young gentleman for having no one to look  after him. Out of the smudgy little window you could see an immense  expanse of sad-looking sky, and whenever there were clouds they looked  very worn, old clouds, frayed at the edges, with holes in them, or dark  stains like tea.    While the water was heating, Ma Parker began sweeping the floor. \"Yes,\"  she thought, as the broom knocked, \"what with one thing and another I've  had my share. I've had a hard life.\"    Even the neighbours said that of her. Many a time, hobbling home with  her fish bag she heard them, waiting at the corner, or leaning over  the area railings, say among themselves, \"She's had a hard life, has Ma  Parker.\" And it was so true she wasn't in the least proud of it. It was  just as if you were to say she lived in the basement-back at Number 27.  A hard life!...    At sixteen she'd left Stratford and come up to London as kitching-maid.  Yes, she was born in Stratford-on-Avon. Shakespeare, sir? No, people  were always arsking her about him. But she'd never heard his name until  she saw it on the theatres.    Nothing remained of Stratford except that \"sitting in the fire-place  of a evening you could see the stars through the chimley,\" and \"Mother  always 'ad 'er side of bacon, 'anging from the ceiling.\" And there was  something--a bush, there was--at the front door, that smelt ever so  nice. But the bush was very vague. She'd only remembered it once or  twice in the hospital, when she'd been taken bad.    That was a dreadful place--her first place. She was never allowed out.  She never went upstairs except for prayers morning and evening. It was a  fair cellar. And the cook was a cruel woman. She used to snatch away her  letters from home before she'd read them, and throw them in the range  because they made her dreamy... And the beedles! Would you believe  it?--until she came to London she'd never seen a black beedle. Here Ma  always gave a little laugh, as though--not to have seen a black beedle!  Well! It was as if to say you'd never seen your own feet.    When that family was sold up she went as \"help\" to a doctor's house, and  after two years there, on the run from morning till night, she married  her husband. He was a baker.    \"A baker, Mrs. Parker!\" the literary gentleman would say. For  occasionally he laid aside his tomes and lent an ear, at least, to this  product called Life. \"It must be rather nice to be married to a baker!\"    Mrs. Parker didn't look so sure.    \"Such a clean trade,\" said the gentleman.    Mrs. Parker didn't look convinced.    \"And didn't you like handing the new loaves to the customers?\"    \"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Parker, \"I wasn't in the shop above a great deal.  We had thirteen little ones and buried seven of them. If it wasn't the  'ospital it was the infirmary, you might say!\"    \"You might, indeed, Mrs. Parker!\" said the gentleman, shuddering, and  taking up his pen again.    Yes, seven had gone, and while the six were still small her husband was  taken ill with consumption. It was flour on the lungs, the doctor told  her at the time... Her husband sat up in bed with his shirt pulled over  his head, and the doctor's finger drew a circle on his back.    \"Now, if we were to cut him open here, Mrs. Parker,\" said the doctor,  \"you'd find his lungs chock-a-block with white powder. Breathe, my  good fellow!\" And Mrs. Parker never knew for certain whether she saw or  whether she fancied she saw a great fan of white dust come out of her  poor dead husband's lips...    But the struggle she'd had to bring up those six little children and  keep herself to herself. Terrible it had been! Then, just when they were  old enough to go to school her husband's sister came to stop with them  to help things along, and she hadn't been there more than two months  when she fell down a flight of steps and hurt her spine. And for five  years Ma Parker had another baby--and such a one for crying!--to look  after. Then young Maudie went wrong and took her sister Alice with her;  the two boys emigrated, and young Jim went to India with the army, and  Ethel, the youngest, married a good-for-nothing little waiter who died  of ulcers the year little Lennie was born. And now little Lennie--my  grandson...    The piles of dirty cups, dirty dishes, were washed and dried. The  ink-black knives were cleaned with a piece of potato and finished off  with a piece of cork. The table was scrubbed, and the dresser and the  sink that had sardine tails swimming in it...    He'd never been a strong child--never from the first. He'd been one of  those fair babies that everybody took for a girl. Silvery fair curls he  had, blue eyes, and a little freckle like a diamond on one side of his  nose. The trouble she and Ethel had had to rear that child! The things  out of the newspapers they tried him with! Every Sunday morning Ethel  would read aloud while Ma Parker did her washing.    \"Dear Sir,--Just a line to let you know my little Myrtil was laid out  for dead... After four bottils... gained 8 lbs. in 9 weeks, and is still  putting it on.\"    And then the egg-cup of ink would come off the dresser and the letter  would be written, and Ma would buy a postal order on her way to work  next morning. But it was no use. Nothing made little Lennie put it  on. Taking him to the cemetery, even, never gave him a colour; a nice  shake-up in the bus never improved his appetite.    But he was gran's boy from the first...    \"Whose boy are you?\" said old Ma Parker, straightening up from the stove  and going over to the smudgy window. And a little voice, so warm, so  close, it half stifled her--it seemed to be in her breast under her  heart--laughed out, and said, \"I'm gran's boy!\"    At that moment there was a sound of steps, and the literary gentleman  appeared, dressed for walking.    \"Oh, Mrs. Parker, I'm going out.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"And you'll find your half-crown in the tray of the inkstand.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    \"Oh, by the way, Mrs. Parker,\" said the literary gentleman quickly, \"you  didn't throw away any cocoa last time you were here--did you?\"    \"No, sir.\" \"Very strange. I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of  cocoa in the tin.\" He broke off. He said softly and firmly, \"You'll  always tell me when you throw things away--won't you, Mrs. Parker?\" And  he walked off very well pleased with himself, convinced, in fact,  he'd shown Mrs. Parker that under his apparent carelessness he was as  vigilant as a woman.    The door banged. She took her brushes and cloths into the bedroom. But  when she began to make the bed, smoothing, tucking, patting, the thought  of little Lennie was unbearable. Why did he have to suffer so? That's  what she couldn't understand. Why should a little angel child have to  arsk for his breath and fight for it? There was no sense in making a  child suffer like that.    ... From Lennie's little box of a chest there came a sound as though  something was boiling. There was a great lump of something bubbling in  his chest that he couldn't get rid of. When he coughed the sweat sprang  out on his head; his eyes bulged, his hands waved, and the great lump  bubbled as a potato knocks in a saucepan. But what was more awful than  all was when he didn't cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke  or answered, or even made as if he heard. Only he looked offended.    \"It's not your poor old gran's doing it, my lovey,\" said old Ma Parker,  patting back the damp hair from his little scarlet ears. But Lennie  moved his head and edged away. Dreadfully offended with her he  looked--and solemn. He bent his head and looked at her sideways as  though he couldn't have believed it of his gran.    But at the last... Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed. No, she  simply couldn't think about it. It was too much--she'd had too much  in her life to bear. She'd borne it up till now, she'd kept herself  to herself, and never once had she been seen to cry. Never by a living  soul. Not even her own children had seen Ma break down. She'd kept a  proud face always. But now! Lennie gone--what had she? She had nothing.  He was all she'd got from life, and now he was took too. Why must it  all have happened to me? she wondered. \"What have I done?\" said old Ma  Parker. \"What have I done?\"    As she said those words she suddenly let fall her brush. She found  herself in the kitchen. Her misery was so terrible that she pinned on  her hat, put on her jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in  a dream. She did not know what she was doing. She was like a person so  dazed by the horror of what has happened that he walks away--anywhere,  as though by walking away he could escape...

After many struggles Cortes found himself  master of the capital, and of all the resources of the Mexican  Empire (1521). These he hastened to place at the feet of the Emperor  Charles V., who appointed him Governor and Captain-General of Mexico.  It is characteristic throughout the history of the New World, that  none of the soldiers of fortune who found it such an easy prey ever  thought of setting up an empire for himself. This is a testimony  to the influence national feeling had upon the minds even of the  most lawless, and the result was that Europe and European ideas  were brought over into America, or rather the New World became  tributary to Europe.    As soon as Cortes had established himself he fitted out expeditions  to explore the country, and himself reached Honduras after a remarkable  journey for over 1000 miles, in which he was only guided by a map on  cotton cloth, on which the Cacique of Tabasco had painted all the  towns, rivers, and mountains of the country as far as Nicaragua. He  also despatched a small fleet under Alvarro de Saavedra to support  a Spanish expedition which had been sent to the Moluccas under  Sebastian del Cano, and which arrived at Tidor in 1527, to the  astonishment of Spanish and Portuguese alike when they heard he  had started from New Castile. In 1536, Cortes, who had been in  the meantime shorn of much of his power, conducted an expedition  by sea along the north-west coast of Mexico, and reached what he  considered to be a great island. He identified this with an imaginary  island in the Far East, near the terrestrial paradise to which  the name of California had been given in a contemporary romance.  Thus, owing to Cortes, almost the whole of Central America had  become known before his death in 1540. Similarly, at a much earlier  period, Ponce de Leon had thought he had discovered another great  island in Florida in 1512, whither he had gone in search of Bayuca,  a fabled island of the Indians, in which they stated was a fountain  of eternal youth. At the time of Cortes' first attempt on Mexico,  Pineda had coasted round Florida, and connected it with the rest  of the coast of Mexico, which he traversed as far as Vera Cruz.    The exploits of Cortes were all important in their effects. He had  proved with what ease a handful of men might overcome an empire and  gain unparalleled riches. Francisco Pizarro was encouraged by the  success of Cortes to attempt the discovery of the El Dorado he had  heard of when on Balboa's expedition. With a companion named Diego  de Almegro he made several coasting expeditions down the northwest  coast of South America, during which they heard of the empire of  the Incas on the plateau of Peru. They also obtained sufficient  gold and silver to raise their hopes of the riches of the country,  and returned to Spain to report to the Emperor. Pizarro obtained  permission from Charles V. to attempt the conquest of Peru, of which  he was named Governor and Captain-General, on condition of paying a  tribute of one-fifth of the treasure he might obtain. He started  in February 1531 with a small force of 180 men, of whom thirty-six  were horsemen. Adopting the policy of Cortes, he pushed directly  for the capital Cuzco, where they managed to seize Atahualpa, the  Inca of the time. He attempted to ransom himself by agreeing to  fill the room in which he was confined, twenty-two feet long by  sixteen wide, with bars of gold as high as the hand could reach.  He carried out this prodigious promise, and Pizarro's companions  found themselves in possession of booty equal to three millions  sterling.    Atahualpa was, however, not released, but condemned to death on  a frivolous pretext, while Pizarro dismissed his followers, fully  confident that the wealth they carried off would attract as many  men as he could desire to El Dorado. He settled himself at Lima,  near the coast, in 1534. Meanwhile Almegro had been despatched  south, and made himself master of Chili. Another expedition in  1539 was conducted by Pizarro's brother Gonzales across the Andes,  and reached the sources of the Amazon, which one of his companions,  Francisco de Orellana, traversed as far as the mouth. This he reached  in August 1541, after a voyage of one thousand leagues. The river  was named after Orellana, but, from reports he made of the existence  of a tribe of female warriors, was afterwards known as the river  of the Amazons. The author spread reports of another El Dorado to  the north, in which the roofs of the temples were covered with  gold. This report afterwards led to the disastrous expedition of  Sir Walter Raleigh to Guiana. By his voyage Orellana connected the  Spanish and Portuguese \"spheres of influence\" in the New World of  Amerigo. By the year 1540 the main outlines of Central and South  America and something of the interior had been made known by the  Spanish adventurers within half a century of Columbus' first voyage.  Owing to the papal bull Portugal possessed Brazil, but all the  rest of the huge stretch of country was claimed for Spain. The  Portuguese wisely treated Brazil as an outlet for their overflowing  population, which settled there in large numbers and established  plantations. The Spaniards, on the other hand, only regarded their  huge possessions as exclusive markets to be merely visited by them.  Rich mines of gold, silver, and mercury were discovered in Mexico  and Peru, especially in the far-famed mines of Potosi, and these  were exploited entirely in the interests of Spain, which acted as a  sieve by which the precious metals were poured into Europe, raising  prices throughout the Old World. In return European merchandise was  sent in the return voyages of the Spanish galleons to New Spain,  which could only buy Flemish cloth, for example, through Spanish  intermediaries, who raised its price to three times the original  cost. This short-sighted policy on the part of Spain naturally  encouraged smuggling, and attracted the ships of all nations towards  that pursuit.    We have already seen the first attempts of the French and English  in the exploration of the north-east coast of North America; but  during the sixteenth century very little was done to settle on  such inhospitable shores, which did not offer anything like the  rich prizes that Tropical America afforded. Neither the exploration  of Cartier in 1534, or that of the Cabots much earlier, was followed  by any attempt to possess the land. Breton fishermen visited the  fisheries off Newfoundland, and various explorers attempted to find  openings which would give them a north-west passage, but otherwise  the more northerly part of the continent was left unoccupied till  the beginning of the seventeenth century. The first town founded was  that of St. Augustine, in Florida, in 1565, but this was destroyed  three years later by a French expedition. Sir Walter Raleigh attempted  to found a colony in 1584 near where Virginia now stands, but it  failed after three years, and it was not till the reign of James  I. that an organised attempt was made by England to establish  plantations, as they were then called, on the North American coast.    Two Chartered Companies, the one to the north named the Plymouth  Company, and the one to the south named the London Company (both  founded in 1606), nominally divided between them all the coast  from Nova Scotia to Florida. These large tracts of country were  during the seventeenth century slowly parcelled out into smaller  states, mainly Puritan in the north (New England), High Church  and Catholic in the south (Virginia and Maryland). But between the  two, and on the banks of the Hudson and the Delaware, two other  European nations had also formed plantations--the Dutch along the  Hudson from 1609 forming the New Netherlands, and the Swedes from  1636 along the Delaware forming New Sweden. The latter, however,  lasted only a few years, and was absorbed by the Dutch in 1655.  The capital of New Netherlands was established on Manhattan Island,  to the south of the palisade still known as Wall Street, and the  city was named New Amsterdam. The Hudson is such an important artery  of commerce between the Atlantic and the great lakes, that this  wedge between the two sets of English colonies would have been a  bar to any future progress. This was recognised by Charles II.,  who in 1664 despatched an expedition to demand its surrender, even  though England and Holland were at that time at peace. New Amsterdam  was taken, and named New York, after the king's brother, the Duke  of York, afterwards James II. New Sweden, which at the same time  fell into the English hands, was sold as a proprietary plantation  to a Jersey man, Sir George Carteret, and to a Quaker, William  Penn. By this somewhat high-handed procedure the whole coast-line  down to Florida was in English hands.    Both the London and Plymouth Companies had started to form plantations  in 1607, and in that very year the French made their first effective  settlements in America, at Port Royal and at Nova Scotia, then  called Arcadie; while, the following year, Samuel de Champlain  made settlements at Quebec, and founded French Canada. He explored  the lake country, and established settlements down the banks of the  St. Lawrence, along which French activity for a long time confined  itself. Between the French and the English settlements roved the  warlike Five Nations of the Iroquois Indians, and Champlain, whose  settlements were in the country of the Algonquins, was obliged  to take their part and make the Iroquois the enemies of France,  which had important effects upon the final struggle between England  and France in the eighteenth century. The French continued their  exploration of the interior of the continent. In 1673 Marquette  discovered the Mississippi (Missi Sepe, \"the great water\"),"]]]
