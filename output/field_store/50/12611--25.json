He  withdrew himself from the troubles of English politics by going on  crusade, and with him went his former enemy, Simon of Leicester.  Richard was back in England early in 1242, and on November 23, 1243,  his marriage with Sanchia of Provence, the younger sister of the queens  of France and England, completed his conversion to the court party.    Henry III.'s cosmopolitan instincts led him to take as much part in  foreign politics as his resources allowed. In 1235 he married his  sister Isabella to Frederick II., and henceforth manifested a strong  interest in the affairs of his imperial brother-in-law. His relations  with France were still uneasy, and he hoped to find in Frederick's  support a counterpoise to the steady pressure of French hostility. All  England watched with interest the progress of the emperor's arms. Peter  of Savoy led an English contingent to fight for Frederick against the  Milanese, and Matthew Paris, the greatest of the English chroniclers,  narrates the campaign of Corte Nuova with a detail exceeding that which  he allows to the military enterprises of his own king. Frederick  constantly corresponded with both the king and Richard of Cornwall, and  it was nothing but solicitude for the safely of the heir to the throne  that led the English magnates to reject the emperor's request that  Richard should receive a high command under him. Even Frederick's  breach with the pope in 1239 did not destroy his friendship with Henry.  The situation became extremely complicated, since Innocent IV. derived  large financial support for his crusade from the unwilling English  clergy, while Henry still professed to be Frederick's friend. The king  allowed Otto to proclaim Frederick's excommunication in England, and  then urged the legate to quit the country because the emperor strongly  protested against the presence of an avowed enemy at his  brother-in-law's court. Neither pope nor emperor could rely upon the  support of so half-hearted a prince. Renewed trouble with France  explains in some measure the anxiety of Henry to remain in good  relations with the emperor despite Frederick's quarrel with the pope.    The position of the French monarchy was far stronger than it had been  when Henry first intervened in continental politics. Blanche of Castile  had broken the back of the feudal coalition, and even Peter Mauclerc had  made his peace with the monarchy at the price of his English earldom.  Louis IX. attained his majority in 1235, and his first care was to  strengthen his power in his newly won dominions. If Poitou were still in  the hands of the Count of La Marche and the Viscount of Thouars, the  royal seneschals of Beaucaire and Carcassonne after 1229 ruled over a  large part of the old dominions of Raymond of Toulouse. In 1237 the  treaty of Meaux was further carried out by the marriage of Raymond's  daughter and heiress, Joan, to Alfonse, the brother of the French king.  In 1241 Alfonse came of age, and Louis at once invested him with Poitou  and Auvergne. The lords of Poitou saw that the same process which had  destroyed the feudal liberties of Normandy now endangered their  disorderly independence. Hugh of Lusignan and his wife had been present  at Alfonse's investiture, and the widow of King John had gone away  highly indignant at the slights put upon her dignity.[1] She bitterly  reproached her husband with the ignominy involved in his submission.  Easily moved to new treasons, Hugh became the soul of a league of  Poitevin barons formed at Parthenay, which received the adhesion of  Henry's seneschal of Gascony, Rostand de Sollers, and even of Alfonse's  father-in-law, the depressed Raymond of Toulouse. At Christmas Hugh  openly showed his hand. He renounced his homage to Alfonse, declared his  adhesion to his step-son, Richard of Cornwall, the titular count of  Poitou, and ostentatiously withdrew from the court with his wife. The  rest of the winter was taken up with preparations for the forthcoming  struggle.        [1] See the graphic letter of a citizen of La Rochelle to      Blanche, published by M. Delisle in _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole      des Chartes_, serie ii., iv., 513-55 (1856).    Untaught by experience, Henry III. listened to the appeals of his  mother and her husband. Richard of Cornwall, who came back from his  crusade in January, 1242, was persuaded that he had another chance of  realising his vain title of Count of Poitou. But the king had neither  men nor money and the parliament of February 2 refused to grant him  sums adequate for his need, so that, despairing of dealing with his  barons in a body, Henry followed the legate's example of winning men  over individually. He made a strong protest against the King of  France's breach of the existing truce, and his step-father assured him  that Poitou and Gascony would provide him with sufficient soldiers if  he brought over enough money to pay them. Thereupon, leaving the  Archbishop of York as regent, Henry took ship on May 9 at Portsmouth  and landed on May 13 at Royan at the mouth of the Gironde. He was  accompanied by Richard of Cornwall, seven earls, and 300 knights.    Meanwhile Louis IX. marshalled a vast host at Chinon, which from April  to July overran the patrimony of the house of Lusignan, and forced many  of the confederate barons to submit. Peter of Savoy and John Mansel,  Henry's favourite clerk, then made seneschal of Gascony, assembled the  Aquitanian levies, while Peter of Aigueblanche, the Savoyard Bishop of  Hereford, went to Provence to negotiate the union between Earl Richard  and Sanchia, and, if possible, to add Raymond Berengar to the coalition  against the husband of his eldest daughter. Henry hoped to win tactical  advantages by provoking Louis to break the truce, and mendaciously  protested his surprise at being forced into an unexpected conflict with  his brother-in-law. Towards the end of July, Louis, who had conquered  all Poitou, advanced to the Charente, and occupied Taillebourg. If the  Charente were once crossed, Saintonge would assuredly follow the  destinies of Poitou; and the Anglo-Gascon army advanced from Saintes to  dispute the passage of the river. On July 21 the two armies were in  presence of each other, separated only by the Charente. Besides the  stone bridge at Taillebourg, the French had erected a temporary wooden  structure higher up the stream, and had collected a large number of  boats to facilitate their passage. Seeing with dismay the oriflamme  waving over the sea of tents which, \"like a great and populous city,\"  covered the right bank, the soldiers of Henry retreated precipitately  to Saintes. There was imminent danger of their retreat being cut off,  but Richard of Cornwall went to the French camp, and obtained an  armistice of a few hours, which gave his brother time to reach the  town.    Next day Louis advanced at his ease to the capital of Saintonge. The  Anglo-Gascons went out to meet him, and, despite their inferior numbers,  fought bravely amidst the vineyards and hollow lanes to the west of the  city. But the English king was the first to flee, and victory soon  attended the arms of the French. Immediately after the battle, the lords  of Poitou abandoned Richard for Alfonse. Henry fled from Saintes to  Pons, from Pons to Barbezieux, and thence sought a more secure refuge at  Blaye, leaving his tent, the ornaments of his chapel, and the beer  provided for his English soldiers as booty for the enemy. The outbreak  of an epidemic in the French army alone prevented a siege of Bordeaux,  by necessitating the return of St. Louis to the healthier north. Henry  lingered at Bordeaux until September, when he returned to England.[1]  Meanwhile the French dictated peace to the remaining allies of Henry. On  the death of Raymond of Toulouse, in 1249, Alfonse quietly succeeded to  his dominions. The next twenty years saw the gradual extension of the  French administrative system to Poitou, Auvergne, and the Toulousain.  English Gascony was reduced to little more than the districts round  Bordeaux and Bayonne. Even a show of hostility was no longer useful, and  on April 7, 1243, a five years' truce between Henry and Louis was signed  at Bordeaux. The marriage of Beatrice of Provence, the youngest of the  daughters of Raymond Berengar, to Charles of Anjou, Louis' younger  brother, removed Provence from the sphere of English influence. On his  father-in-law's death in 1245, Charles of Anjou succeeded to his  dominions to the prejudice of his two English brothers-in-law, and  became the founder of a Capetian line of counts of Provence, which  brought the great fief of the empire under the same northern French  influences which Alfonse of Poitiers was diffusing over the lost  inheritances of Eleanor of Aquitaine and the house of Saint-Gilles.        [1] The only good modern account of this expedition is that by      M. Charles Bemont, _La campagne de Poitou, 1242-3_, in _Annales      du Midi_, v., 389-314 (1893). For the Lusignans see Boissonade,      _Quomodo comites Engolismenses erga reges Angliae et Franciae      se gesserint_, 1152-1328 (1893).    A minor result of Louis' triumph was the well-deserved ruin of Hugh of  Lusignan and Isabella of Angouleme. The proud spirit of Isabella did  not long tolerate her humiliation. She retired to Fontevraud and died  there in 1246. Hugh X. followed her to the tomb in 1248. Their eldest  son, Hugh XI., succeeded him, but the rest of their numerous family  turned for support to the inexhaustible charity of the King of England.  Thus in 1247 a Poitevin invasion of the king's half-brothers and  sisters recalled to his much-tried subjects the Savoyard invasion of  ten years earlier. In that single year three of the king's brothers and  one of his sisters accepted his invitation to make a home"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#19)"],[1,";  That the rich could inherit earth's fullness and their loot be quite       secure;  That the world-mart be wider opened to the product mulct from toil;  That the labor and land of our neighbors should become your war-won       spoil;  That the eyes of an outraged people might be turned from your graft and       greed  In the misruled, plundered home-land by lure of war's ghastly deed;  And that priests of the warring nations could pray to the selfsame God  For His blessing on battle and murder and corpse-strewn, blood-soaked       sod.

The Way to Peace    AN INTERVIEW WITH JACOB H. SCHIFF.         One of the leading American financiers and noted       philanthropist; founder of Jewish Theological Seminary and of       Semitic Museum at Harvard University; a native of Germany and       member of the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., bankers.    By Edward Marshall.      American as I am in every fibre, and in accord as I feel with every  interest of the country of my adoption, I cannot find myself in  agreement with what appears to be, to a considerable extent, American  opinion as to the origin and responsibility for the deplorable conflict  in which almost all of Europe has become involved.    For many reasons my personal sympathies are with Germany. I cannot feel  convinced that she has been the real aggressor; I believe that war was  forced upon her, almost as if by prearrangement among the nations with  whom she now contends; I cannot but believe that they had become jealous  and envious of her rapid and unprecedented peaceful development and had  concluded that the moment had arrived when all was favorable for a union  against her.    Although I left Germany half a century ago, I would think as little of  arraying myself against her, the country of my birth, in this the moment  of her struggle for existence, as of arraying myself against my parents.    But while I steadfastly believe this war to have been forced upon  Germany against her will, I also believe that circumstances which were  stronger than the Governments of England and France, her present  enemies, were necessary to overcome an equally definite reluctance upon  their part.    In other words, I cannot wholly blame the English Government, or the  French Government, any more than I can wholly blame the German  Government.    Let us see how the great tragedy came about. It is safe to pass rapidly  over the Servian-Bosnian-Herzegovinian-Austro-Hungarian complication  which served as the immediate precipitant of hostilities. It has been  detailed repeatedly in THE TIMES and other American publications.    It had reached a point at which the Austro-Hungarian Government felt  compelled to take extreme measures by means of which to safeguard the  integrity of the empire.    The firm but fatal ultimatum to Servia followed, the reply to which,  suffice it to say, was unsatisfactory to Austria, who could not accept  the suggestion of an investigation into the circumstances attending the  assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand through a commission or court on  which she was not represented.      Like Maine Case.    The situation really was analogous to that which existed between the  United States and Spain when the Maine was blown up in Havana Harbor. In  order to fix the responsibility for this dastardly affair we then  similarly demanded an investigation by Spain, to be carried out with the  assistance of representatives of this Government. Spain, too, then  offered to conduct an investigation, but she peremptorily declined to  allow us to take part in it.    This attitude on her part quickly brought about our declaration of war  against her. It is important that Americans should realize the  similarity in the two situations and the likeness of the Austrian action  of 1914 to that which our own Government took in 1898.    As soon as Austria had rejected as unsatisfactory Servia's reply to her  ultimatum she prepared to undertake a punitive armed expedition against  Servia, and Russia at once declared that she would rank herself as  Servia's protector.    Indeed, without any further parley, and to give effect to this threat,  Russia immediately mobilized her army. Since then it has been averred  that this mobilization had been in progress for several weeks previous  to Servia's rejection of the Austrian ultimatum.    This made it obligatory upon Germany to go to Austria's aid, under the  provisions of their treaty of alliance, although she was well aware that  such an action would bring France into the conflict under the terms of  her alliance with Russia. Indeed, an unsatisfactory reply had been  received from France as to the latter's intentions, but Germany  endeavored to secure at least an assurance of England's neutrality. This  proved to be impossible.    How the German Government could indulge for a moment in the hope that in  a war with Russia and France on the one side and Germany and Austria on  the other, England could be induced to remain neutral passes  comprehension, but that it did believe this seems a certainty.    The English Government, no doubt, correctly felt that without the aid of  its immense resources, and particularly without the operations of its  great navy against Germany and Austria, the latter nations would find it  not so very difficult a task to dispose of both Russia and France.    English statesmen very promptly must have become alive to the  probability that a Germany which had subdued Russia and France, and thus  had made itself master of the Continent, would be unlikely long to  tolerate a continuance of England's world leadership.    So, even if the neutrality of Belgium had not been violated, other  reasons would have been found by England for joining France and Russia  in the war against Germany, for England would not risk, without any  effort to protect them, the loss of her continued domination of the  high seas and her undisputed possession of her vast colonial empire.      Germany Fighting for Life.    I am not defending the violation of Belgian neutrality. This,  undeniably, was a most unjustifiable action, in spite of German claims  that she was forced into it by the necessities of the situation. But I  am explaining that, even had it not occurred, still England would have  gone to war.    That was the situation.    Germany is now fighting for her very existence, and I, who am not  without knowledge of German conditions, am convinced that never has  there been a war more wholly that of a whole people than is this present  conflict, as far as Germany is concerned.    Any one who has been in even superficial touch with German public  opinion and individual feeling in any part of the empire, since the war  began, must know that there is hardly a man, woman, or child throughout  the empire who would hesitate if called upon to sacrifice possessions or  life in order to insure victory to the Fatherland. Seventy million  people who are animated by unanimous sentiment of this sort cannot be  crushed, probably not subdued.    And England is confronted by the certainty that her world leadership is  the stake for which she is fighting; that her defeat would mean the end  of the vast dominance which she has exercised throughout the world,  since the time of the Armada, through the power of her great navy.    Is it not apparent, therefore, that these nations, if left to  themselves, inevitably must continue the war until one side or the  other, or both, shall become exhausted--an eventuation which may be  postponed not for mere months but for years?    In our own civil war Grant for almost two years stood within a hundred  or a hundred and fifty miles of Richmond, the heart of the Confederacy,  and was not able to sufficiently subdue Lee's forces to enable him to  get possession of the city until the complete exhaustion of the  Confederacy's resources in men and money had been accomplished.
