Then said I: 'While I follow thy reasonings, I am deeply impressed with  their truth; but if I turn to the common convictions of men, I find few  who will even listen to such arguments, let alone admit them to be  credible.'    'True,' said she; 'they cannot lift eyes accustomed to darkness to the  light of clear truth, and are like those birds whose vision night  illumines and day blinds; for while they regard, not the order of the  universe, but their own dispositions of mind, they think the license to  commit crime, and the escape from punishment, to be fortunate. But mark  the ordinance of eternal law. Hast thou fashioned thy soul to the  likeness of the better, thou hast no need of a judge to award the  prize--by thine own act hast thou raised thyself in the scale of  excellence; hast thou perverted thy affections to baser things, look not  for punishment from one without thee--thine own act hath degraded thee,  and thrust thee down. Even so, if alternately thou turn thy gaze upon  the vile earth and upon the heavens, though all without thee stand  still, by the mere laws of sight thou seemest now sunk in the mire, now  soaring among the stars. But the common herd regards not these things.  What, then? Shall we go over to those whom we have shown to be like  brute beasts? Why, suppose, now, one who had quite lost his sight  should likewise forget that he had ever possessed the faculty of vision,  and should imagine that nothing was wanting in him to human perfection,  should we deem those who saw as well as ever blind? Why, they will not  even assent to this, either--that they who do wrong are more wretched  than those who suffer wrong, though the proof of this rests on grounds  of reason no less strong.'    'Let me hear these same reasons,' said I.    'Wouldst thou deny that every wicked man deserves punishment?'    'I would not, certainly.'    'And that those who are wicked are unhappy is clear in manifold ways?'    'Yes,' I replied.    'Thou dost not doubt, then, that those who deserve punishment are  wretched?'    'Agreed,' said I.    'So, then, if thou wert sitting in judgment, on whom wouldst thou decree  the infliction of punishment--on him who had done the wrong, or on him  who had suffered it?'    'Without doubt, I would compensate the sufferer at the cost of the doer  of the wrong.'    'Then, the injurer would seem more wretched than the injured?'    'Yes; it follows. And so for this and other reasons resting on the same  ground, inasmuch as baseness of its own nature makes men wretched, it is  plain that a wrong involves the misery of the doer, not of the  sufferer.'    'And yet,' says she, 'the practice of the law-courts is just the  opposite: advocates try to arouse the commiseration of the judges for  those who have endured some grievous and cruel wrong; whereas pity is  rather due to the criminal, who ought to be brought to the judgment-seat  by his accusers in a spirit not of anger, but of compassion and  kindness, as a sick man to the physician, to have the ulcer of his fault  cut away by punishment. Whereby the business of the advocate would  either wholly come to a standstill, or, did men prefer to make it  serviceable to mankind, would be restricted to the practice of  accusation. The wicked themselves also, if through some chink or cranny  they were permitted to behold the virtue they have forsaken, and were to  see that by the pains of punishment they would rid themselves of the  uncleanness of their vices, and win in exchange the recompense of  righteousness, they would no longer think these sufferings pains; they  would refuse the help of advocates, and would commit themselves wholly  into the hands of their accusers and judges. Whence it comes to pass  that for the wise no place is left for hatred; only the most foolish  would hate the good, and to hate the bad is unreasonable. For if vicious  propensity is, as it were, a disease of the soul like bodily sickness,  even as we account the sick in body by no means deserving of hate, but  rather of pity, so, and much more, should they be pitied whose minds are  assailed by wickedness, which is more frightful than any sickness.'        SONG IV.    THE UNREASONABLENESS OF HATRED.            Why all this furious strife? Oh, why      With rash and wilful hand provoke death's destined day?        If death ye seek--lo! Death is nigh,      Not of their master's will those coursers swift delay!          The wild beasts vent on man their rage,      Yet 'gainst their brothers' lives men point the murderous steel;        Unjust and cruel wars they wage,      And haste with flying darts the death to meet or deal.          No right nor reason can they show;      'Tis but because their lands and laws are not the same.        Wouldst _thou_ give each his due; then know      Thy love the good must have, the bad thy pity claim.        V.      On this I said: 'I see how there is a happiness and misery founded on  the actual deserts of the righteous and the wicked. Nevertheless, I  wonder in myself whether there is not some good and evil in fortune as  the vulgar understand it. Surely, no sensible man would rather be  exiled, poor and disgraced, than dwell prosperously in his own country,  powerful, wealthy, and high in honour. Indeed, the work of wisdom is  more clear and manifest in its operation when the happiness of rulers is  somehow passed on to the people around them, especially considering that  the prison, the law, and the other pains of legal punishment are  properly due only to mischievous citizens on whose account they were  originally instituted. Accordingly, I do exceedingly marvel why all this  is completely reversed--why the good are harassed with the penalties due  to crime, and the bad carry off the rewards of virtue; and I long to  hear from thee what reason may be found for so unjust a state of  disorder. For assuredly I should wonder less if I could believe that all  things are the confused result of chance. But now my belief in God's  governance doth add amazement to amazement. For, seeing that He  sometimes assigns fair fortune to the good and harsh fortune to the bad,  and then again deals harshly with the good, and grants to the bad their  hearts' desire, how does this differ from chance, unless some reason is  discovered for it all?'    'Nay; it is not wonderful,' said she, 'if all should be thought random  and confused when the principle of order is not known. And though thou  knowest not the causes on which this great system depends, yet forasmuch  as a good ruler governs the world, doubt not for thy part that all is  rightly done.'        SONG V.    WONDER AND IGNORANCE.          Who knoweth not how near the pole        Bootes' course doth go,      Must marvel by what heavenly law        He moves his Wain so slow;      Why late he plunges 'neath the main,      And swiftly lights his beams again.        When the full-orbed moon grows pale        In the mid course of night,      And suddenly the stars shine forth        That languished in her light,      Th' astonied nations stand at gaze,      And beat the air in wild amaze.[M]        None marvels why upon the shore        The storm-lashed breakers beat,      Nor why the frost-bound glaciers melt        At summer's fervent heat;      For here the cause seems plain and clear,      Only what's dark and hid we fear.        Weak-minded folly magnifies        All that is rare and strange,      And the dull herd's o'erwhelmed with awe        At unexpected change.      But wonder leaves enlightened minds,      When ignorance no longer blinds.    FOOTNOTES:    [M] To frighten away the monster swallowing the moon. The superstition  was once common. See Tylor's 'Primitive Culture,' pp. 296-302.        VI.      'True,' said I; 'but, since it is thy office to unfold the hidden cause  of things, and explain principles veiled in darkness, inform me, I pray  thee, of thine own conclusions in this matter, since the marvel of it is  what more than aught else disturbs my mind.'    A smile played one moment upon her lips as she replied: 'Thou callest me  to the greatest of all subjects of inquiry, a task for which the most  exhaustive treatment barely suffices. Such is its nature that, as fast  as one doubt is cut away, innumerable others spring up like Hydra's  heads, nor could we set any limit to their renewal did we not apply the  mind's living fire to suppress them. For there come within its scope the  questions of the essential simplicity of providence, of the order of  fate, of unforeseen chance, of the Divine knowledge and predestination,  and of the freedom of the will. How heavy is the weight of all this  thou canst judge for thyself. But, inasmuch as to know these things also  is part of the treatment of thy malady, we will try to give them some  consideration, despite the restrictions of the narrow limits of our  time. Moreover, thou must for a time dispense with the pleasures of  music and song, if so be that thou findest any delight therein, whilst I  weave together the connected train of reasons in proper order.'    'As thou wilt,' said I.    Then, as if making a new beginning, she thus discoursed: 'The coming  into being of all things, the whole course of development in things that  change, every sort of thing that moves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#19)"],[1,"to greedy youth    And heartless manhood, cold and cruel age,    Which past the vale and stript of all disguise    Shrinks from the good, and eager slinks away    And seeks those dismal regions of the lost    His opened eyes with sinking heart had seen.    Then showed how love its guardian angel paints    Upon the cooing infant's smiling face,    Grows into gentle youth, and manhood rich    In works of helpfulness and brotherhood,    And ripens into mellow, sweet old age,    Childhood returned with all its gentleness,    Whose funeral-pile but lights the upward way    To those sweet fields his opened eyes had seen,    Those ever-widening mansions of delight.      Enwrapt the teacher taught the living truth;    Enwrapt the hearers heard his living words;    The night unheeded winged its rapid flight,    The morning found their souls from darkness free.      Six yellow robes Benares daily saw,    Six wooden alms-bowls held for daily food,    Six meeting sneers with smiles and hate with love,    Six watchers by the pilgrim's dying bed,    Six noble souls united in the work    Of giving light and hope and help to all.      A rich and noble youth, an only son,    Had seen Gautama passing through the streets,    A holy calm upon his noble face,    Had heard him tell the pilgrims by the stream,    Gasping for breath and breathing out their lives,    Of higher life and joys that never end;    And wearied, sated by the daily round    Of pleasure, luxury and empty show    That waste his days but fail to satisfy,    Yet fearing his companions' gibes and sneers,    He sought the master in the sacred grove    When the full moon was mirrored in the stream,    The sleeping city silvered by its light;    And there he lingered, drinking in his words,    Till night was passed and day was well-nigh spent.      The father, anxious for his absent son,    Had sought him through the night from street to street    In every haunt that youthful folly seeks,    And now despairing sought the sacred grove--    Perhaps by chance, perhaps led by the light    That guides the pigeon to her distant home--    And found him there.  He too the Buddha heard,    And finding light, and filled with joy, he said:    \"Illustrious master, you have found the way.    You place the upturned chalice on its base.    You fill with light the sayings dark of old.    You open blinded eyes to see the truth.\"      At length they thought of those poor hearts at home,    Mother and sister, watching through the night--    Waiting and watching through the livelong day,    Startled at every step, at every sound,    Startled at every bier that came in view    In that great city of the stranger dead,    That city where the living come to die--    And home returned when evening's rose and gold    Had faded from the sky, and myriad lamps    Danced on the sacred stream, and moon and stars    Hung quivering in its dark and silent depths.    But day by day returned, eager to hear    More of that truth that sweetens daily life,    Yet reaches upward to eternal day.      A marriage-feast,[3] three festivals in one,    Stirs to its depths Benares' social life.    A gorgeous sunset ushers in the night,    Sunset and city mirrored in the stream.    Broad marble steps upon the river-bank    Lead to a garden where a blaze of bloom,    A hedge of rose-trees, forms the outer wall;    An aged banyan-tree,[4] whose hundred trunks    Sustain a vaulted roof of living green    Which scarce a ray of noonday's sun can pierce,    The garden's vestibule and outer court;    While trees of every varied leaf and bloom    Shade many winding walks, where fountains fall    With liquid cadence into shining pools.    Above, beyond, the stately palace stands,    Inviting in, calling to peace and rest,    As if a soul dwelt in its marble form.      The darkness thickens, when a flood of light    Fills every recess, lighting every nook;    The garden hedge a wall of mellow light,    A line of lamps along the river's bank,    With lamps in every tree and lining every walk,    While lamps thick set surround each shining pool,    Weaving with rainbow tints the falling spray.    And now the palace through the darkness shines.    A thing of beauty traced with lines of light.[5]      The guests arrive in light and graceful boats,    In gay gondolas such as Venice used,    With richest carpets, richest canopies,    And over walks with rose-leaves carpeted    Pass to the palace, whose wide open gates    Display within Benares' rank and wealth,    Proud Brahman lords and stately Brahman dames    And Brahman youth and beauty, all were there,    Of Aryan blood but bronzed by India's sun,    Not dressed like us, as very fashion-plates,    But clothed in flowing robes of softest wool    And finest silk, a harmony of shades,    Sparkling with gems, ablaze with precious stones.[6]    Three noble couples greet their gathering guests:    An aged Brahman and his aged wife,    For fifty years united in the bonds    Of wedded love, no harsh, unloving word    For all those happy years, their only fear    That death would break the bonds that bound their souls;    And next their eldest born, who sought his son,    And drank deep wisdom from the Buddha's lips,    And by his side that mother we have seen    Outwatch the night, whose sweet and earnest face    By five and twenty years of wedded love,    By five and twenty years of busy cares--    The cares of home, with all its daily joys--    Had gained that look of holy motherhood[7]    That millions worship on their bended knees    As highest emblem of eternal love;    And last that sister whose untiring love    Watched by her mother through the weary hours,    Her fair young face all trust and happiness,    Before her, rainbow-tinted hopes and joys,    Life's dark and cold and cruel side concealed,    And by her side a noble Brahman youth,    Who saw in her his every hope fulfilled.      But where is now that erring, wandering son,    The pride of all these loyal, loving hearts,    Heir to this wealth and hope of this proud house?      Seven clothed in coarsest yellow robes draw near    With heads close shorn and bare, unsandaled feet,    Alms-bowl on shoulder slung and staff in hand,    But moving with that gentle stateliness    That birth and blood, not wealth and effort, give,    All in the strength of manhood's early prime,    All heirs to wealth rejected, cast aside,    But all united in the holy cause    Of giving light and hope and help to all,    While earnest greetings from the evening's hosts    Show they are welcome and expected guests.      Startled, the stately Brahmans turn aside.    \"The heir has lost his reason,\" whispered they,    \"And joined that wandering prince who late appeared    Among the yogis in the sacred grove,    Who thinks he sees the truth by inner sight,    Who fain would teach the wise, and claims to know    More than the fathers and the Vedas teach.\"    But as he nearer came, his stately form,    His noble presence and his earnest face,    Beaming with gentleness and holy love,    Hushed into silence every rising sneer.      One of their number, wise in sacred lore,    Profoundly learned, in all the Vedas versed,    With courtly grace saluting Buddha, said:    \"Our Brahman masters teach that many ways    Lead up to Brahma Loca, Brahma's rest,    As many roads from many distant lands    All meet before Benares' sacred shrines.    They say that he who learns the Vedas' hymns,    Performs the rites and prays the many prayers    That all the sages of the past have taught,    In Brahma's self shall be absorbed at last--    As all the streams from mountain, hill and plain,    That swell proud Gunga's broad and sacred stream,    At last shall mingle with the ocean's waves,    They say that Brahmans are a holy caste,    Of whiter skin and higher, purer blood,    From Brahma sprung, and Brahma's only heirs,    While you proclaim, if rumor speaks the truth,    That only one hard road to Brahma leads,    That every caste is pure, of common blood,    That all are brothers, all from Brahma sprung.\"      But Buddha, full of gentleness, replied:    \"Ye call on Dyaus Pittar, Brahma, God,[8]    One God and Father, called by many names,    One God and Father, seen in many forms,    Seen in the tempest, mingling sea and sky,    The blinding sand-storm, changing day to night,    In gentle showers refreshing thirsty fields,    Seen in the sun whose rising wakes the world,    Whose setting calls a weary world to rest,    Seen in the deep o'erarching azure vault,    By day a sea of light, shining by night    With countless suns of countless worlds unseen,    Making us seem so little, God so great.    Ye say that Brahma dwells in purest light;    Ye say that Brahma's self is perfect love;    Ye pray to Brahma under many names    To give you Brahma Loca's perfect rest.[9]    Your prayers are vain unless your hearts are clean.    For how can darkness dwell with perfect light?    And how can hatred dwell with perfect love?    The slandering tongue, that stirs up strife and hate,    The grasping hand, that takes but never gives,    The lying lips, the cold and cruel heart,    Whence bitterness and wars and murders spring,    Can ne'er by prayers to Brahma Loca climb.[10]    The pure in heart alone with Brahma dwell.    Ye say that Brahmans are a holy caste,    From Brahma sprung and Brahma's only heirs;    But yet in Bactria, whence our fathers came,    And where their brothers and our kindred dwell,    No Brahman ever wore the sacred cord.    Has mighty Brahma there no son, no heir?    The Brahman mother suffers all the pangs    Kshatriyas, Sudras or the Vassas feel.    The Brahman's body, when the soul has fled,    A putrid mass, defiles the earth and air,    Vile as the Sudras or the lowest beasts.    The Brahman murderer, libertine or thief    Ye say will be reborn in lowest beast,    While some poor Sudra, full of gentleness    And pity, charity and trust and "]]]
