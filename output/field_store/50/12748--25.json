The lower  ones sharp-edged and somewhat notched. At birth there are twenty-two  teeth, which are shed, and replaced by others, with sixteen  additional ones, the adult bat having thirty-eight teeth.      _GENUS PLECOTUS_.    Ears very large, united at the base; outer margin of the ear conch  terminating opposite the base of the tragus, the inner margin with  an abrupt rounded projection directed inwards above the base; tragus  very large, tapering upwards, with a lobe at the base of the outer  margin.    Dentition: Inc., 2--2/6; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars, 2--2/2--2;  molars, 3--3/3--3.    The English species _P. auritus_ is very common there, and also in  France; its ears are nearly as long as its body, yet, when reposing,  they are so folded as to be almost out of sight. The Indian species  is only a variety distinguishable by its yet longer ears (\"and  comparative shortness of the thumbs\"--_Dobson_).      NO. 77. PLECOTUS AURITUS _vel_ HOMOCHROUS.    HABITAT.--The Himalayas and the Khasia Hills.    [Figure: _Plecotus auritus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Head slightly raised above the face-line; ears nearly  as long as the fore-arm, joined by a low band across the forehead  at the bases of their inner margins; wings from the base of the toes;  feet slender; tip of the tail free; fur silky, short, and of a uniform  dull brown.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1.7 inch; ears, 1.55 (ears of English type of  same size, 1.4 inch); tail, 1.7 inch. Jerdon gives larger results,  but I put more reliance on Dobson's figures.      _GENUS VESPERUGO_.    Bats with very broad and obtuse muzzles; the glandular prominences  much developed between the eyes and the nostrils; crown of the head  flat; but what distinguishes it from the following genus,  _Scotophilus_, is the presence of four incisors in the upper jaw,  whereas _Scotophilus_ has two only--otherwise the two genera are  very similar.      NO. 78. VESPERUGO NOCTULA.    HABITAT.--Nepal.    [Figure: _Vesperugo noctula_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Head broad and flat; ears oval and broad; the outer  margin convex, reflected backwards, and forming a thick lobe  terminating close to the angle of the mouth; tragus short and curved  inwards; muzzle devoid of hair; fur dark reddish brown.      NO. 79. VESPERUGO LEUCOTIS.    HABITAT.--Deserts of Northern India, and Beluchistan.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Ears, sides of face, about the eyes, interfemoral  membrane, antehumeral membrane, and that portion of the wing  membrane along the sides of the body, white, very translucent;  remaining portion of wing membrane sepia, traversed by very distinct  reticulations; fur on the upper surface black at the base of the hairs  for about half their length, remaining portion light yellowish  brown; beneath the same, but paler, almost white.\"--_Dobson_.      NO. 80. VESPERUGO MAURUS.    HABITAT.--Khasya Hills.

DESCRIPTION (_apud_ Dobson).--Head flat; upper labial glands so  developed as to cause a deep depression between them on the face  behind the nostrils; ears broad as long from behind; the outer margin  extends from the tip to its termination near the corner of the mouth  without emargination or lobe; tragus broad; inner margin straight;  outer convex; small triangular lobe at base. Fur chocolate brown  above, lighter on head and neck; beneath dark brown with lighter tips  on the pubes, and along the thighs dirty white or pale buff.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1.9 inch; tail, 1.65 inch.    There is a good figure of the head of this bat in Dobson's Monograph;  it was obtained by Dr. J. Anderson at an elevation of 4500 feet at  Bhamo.      NO. 82. VESPERUGO PACHYOTIS.    DESCRIPTION.--\"This species is readily distinguished by the  peculiar thickness of the lower half of the outer side of the  ear-conch, which appears as it were excavated out of the thick  integument of the neck; tragus short, curved inwards.\"--_Dobson_.    This bat is more fully described with three illustrations in Dobson's  Monograph; he does not mention where it is found, so it may or it  may not be an Indian species.      NO. 83. VESPERUGO ATRATUS.  _Syn_.--NYCTICEJUS ATRATUS.    HABITAT.--Darjeeling.    DESCRIPTION.--Head broad; muzzle obtuse; upper labial glands  largely developed; ears large, oval, with rounded tips, which in the  natural position of the ears appear acute, owing to the longitudinal  folding of the outer side of the conch on the inner, commencing at  and almost bisecting the tip (_Dobson_). Fur long, dense and black;  Jerdon says rich dark brown; paler beneath.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1.9 inch; tail, 1.8 inch.      NO. 84. VESPERUGO TICKELLI.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle sharper; face hairy; ears pointed; tragus  long; colour dark brown; illustration in Dobson's Monograph.    SIZE.--About 2 inches; tail, 1.6 inch.    Unites the appearance of a _Vespertilio_ to the dentition of  _Vesperugo_.      NO. 87. VESPERUGO DORMERI.    HABITAT.--Southern India and Bellary Hills.    DESCRIPTION.--Head flat; ears shorter, triangular, with rounded  tips; tragus with a small triangular lobe near base of outer margin;  fur brown, with ashy tips above, darker brown below, with the  terminal third of the hairs white. Dentition approaches the next  genus, there being only one pair of unicuspidate upper incisors  placed, one by each upper canine.      NO. 88. (VESPERUGO) SCOTOPHILUS SEROTINUS.  _Syn_.--VESPERUGO SEROTINUS.  _The Silky Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 35_).    HABITAT.--Europe, but extending through Asia to the Himalayas,  Beluchistan and Kashmir.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-1/2 inches; tail, 2; wing expanse, 13.    This is a rare bat in India, though Captain Hutton has procured it  at Mussoorie. In England it is not uncommon even near London; it flies  steadily and rather slow, and is found in ruins, roofs of churches,  and sometimes old hollow trees.      NO. 89. (VESPERUGO) SCOTOPHILUS LEISLERI.  _Syn_.--VESPERUGO LEISLERI.  _The Hairy-armed Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 36_).    HABITAT.--Himalayas.

When any member of this senior division has completed two academic years  of service in that division; has been selected by the president of the  institution and by its professor of military science and tactics (who  must be an army officer); has made a written agreement to continue in  the Reserve Officers' Training Corps for the remainder of his course in  the institution, devoting five hours per week to the military training  prescribed by the Secretary of War; has also made a written agreement to  pursue the courses in training camps (one camp of not more than six  weeks' duration each year) prescribed by the Secretary of War)--when he  has fulfilled all these conditions, he may be given, at the expense of  the United States, a money commutation of subsistence at a rate not  exceeding the cost of the garrison (army) ration during the remainder of  his service in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. This will amount to  about thirty cents a day. This provision applies only to the senior  division.        JUNIOR DIVISION      A junior division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps may be  established at any institution to which an army officer has been  detailed as the professor of military science and tactics, and which  cannot meet the necessary requirements for the senior division. In this  case the Government does not give a commutation of subsistence and the  students are not asked to obligate themselves as in the senior division.        TO ENTER THE RESERVE OFFICERS' CORPS      The President is authorized, under such regulations as he may prescribe,  to appoint in the Officers' Reserve Corps any graduate of the senior  division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, who shall have  satisfactorily completed the two-year course of training (five hours a  week), incident to receiving a commutation of rations; also any graduate  of the junior division who shall have satisfactorily completed the  courses of military training prescribed for students of the senior  divisions, referred to in the first part of this paragraph, and shall  have participated in such practical instruction, subsequent to  graduation, as the Secretary of War shall have prescribed. They must be  twenty-one years of age and must make written agreement under oath to  serve the United States for ten years.    Any physically fit male citizen of the United States, between the ages  of twenty-one and twenty-seven years, who graduated prior to June 22,  1916, from any educational institution at which an officer of the Army  was detailed as professor of military science and tactics, and who,  while a student at such institution, completed courses of military  training substantially equivalent to those prescribed for the senior  division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, may, after  satisfactorily completing such additional practical military training as  the Secretary of War shall prescribe, be eligible for appointment to the  Officers' Reserve Corps.    The President can appoint and commission, as a temporary second  lieutenant of the Regular Army in time of peace, for the purpose of  instruction and for a period not to exceed six months, any Reserve  Officer who was appointed in the manner described in the two preceding  paragraphs. A temporary second lieutenant will receive the allowance  authorized by law for that grade and pay at the rate of $100 a month. He  will be attached to a unit of the Regular Army for duty and training. At  the end of the six months he will revert to the status of a Reserve  Officer.        DEPARTMENT COMMANDER'S REPORT      At the end of each calendar year department commanders and chiefs of  staff corps and departments compile lists of members of the Officers'  Reserve Corps under their command, showing:        (a) Name, rank, age, and address.      (b) Amount of instruction received.      (c) Progress made.      (d) Efficiency of officer.      (e) Recommendation.    A copy of these lists will be forwarded to the Adjutant General of the  Army.    The remainder of this chapter boils down to an irreducible minimum some  of the most important subjects with which a Reserve Officer or an  applicant for a commission in the Officers' Reserve Corps should be  familiar. It emphasizes those things with which a reserve officer should  at once become familiar.[A] It merely opens up a broad field of study  for a reserve officer and at the same time can be used as a place of  reference.        THE LAND FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES      You now are, or expect to become, a member of the land forces of the  United States. Of what do the land forces of the United States consist?  They consist of the Regular Army, the Volunteer Army, the Officers'  Reserve Corps, the Enlisted Reserve Corps, the National Army, the  National Guard in the service of the United States and such other land  forces as Congress may authorize.    The land forces are grouped under two general heads:        (1) The Mobile Army.      (2) The Coast Artillery.    \"The Mobile Army. The mobile army is primarily organized for offensive  operations against an enemy, and on this account requires the maximum  degree of mobility.\" (Field Service Regulations.) It consists of:        Infantry.      Field Artillery.      Cavalry.      Engineers.      Signal Corps Troops.    \"The Coast Artillery. The coast artillery is charged with the care and  use of the fixed and movable elements of the land and coast  fortifications.\" (Field Service Regulations.)    The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the  Army. He exercises his command through the Secretary of War. The Chief  of Staff acts as military adviser to the Secretary of War. He puts into  effect the Administration's wishes.    For the purpose of equipping, inspecting, directing, and administering  to the Army, there are the following corps and departments:         (1) General Staff Corps.       (2) Adjutant General's Department.       (3) Inspector General's Department.       (4) Judge Advocate General's Department.       (5) Quartermaster Corps.       (6) Medical Department.       (7) Ordnance Department.       (8) Bureau of Insular Affairs.       (9) Signal Corps.      (10) Engineer Corps.    The following are the grades of rank and commands of officers and  noncommissioned officers:     (1) General                                     Commands: Armies.   (2) Lieutenant-General                          Commands: Field Army.   (3) Major-General                               Commands: Division.   (4) Brigadier-General                           Commands: Brigade.   (5) Colonel                                     Commands: Regiment.   (6) Lieutenant-Colonel                          Second in command in a Regiment.   (7) Major                                       Commands: Battalion.   (8) Captain                                     Commands: Company.   (9) First Lieutenant                            Commands: Platoon.  (10) Second Lieutenant                           Commands: Platoon.  (11) Veterinarian                                He has no command.  (12) Cadet at United States Military Academy     He has no command.  (13) Sergeant-Major (Regimental)                 He has no command.  (14) Ordnance Sergeant                           He has no command.  (15) Quartermaster Sergeant                      He has no command.  (16) Sergeant-Major (Battalion)                  He has no command.  (17) First Sergeant                              Commands: Platoon.  (18) Sergeant                                    Commands: Sometimes a Platoon.  (19) Corporal                                    Commands: Squad.        ARTICLES OF WAR      The Army is governed by the Articles of War, which can be found in the  Army Regulations. Any laws, orders, et cetera, pertaining to the Army  must not violate directly or indirectly any of the Articles of War. It  is therefore desirable that each Reserve Officer know where to find them  and become, in a general way, familiar with them.        GENERAL ADVICE      To become a first-class drillmaster is desirable and necessary. But,  being one, you are not to be intrusted with the command of troops in the  field unless you have gone much farther than that. To become an  excellent drillmaster means simply that you have mastered a detail. In  order to become one you should bear this in mind: You cannot teach a man  how to do a thing unless you know that thing yourself. If you don't know  your drill, don't try to \"bluff\" your men. Burn the midnight oil, or  remain a private.        MILITARY CORRESPONDENCE      An official letter should refer to one subject only.    In writing to the War Department address your letter to \"The Adjutant  General of the Army, Washington, D. C.\"    The United States (including colonies) is divided into the following  departments:         (1) The Northeastern Department, with Headquarters at Boston,       Massachusetts.         (2) The Eastern Department, with headquarters at Governors Island,       New York.         (3) The Southeastern Department, with Headquarters at Charleston,       South Carolina.         (4) The Central Department, with Headquarters at Chicago, Illinois.         (5) The Southern Department, with Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston,       Texas.         (6) The Western Department, with Headquarters at San Francisco,       California.         (7) The Philippine Department, with Headquarters at Manila. P. I.         (8) The Hawaiian Department, with Headquarters at Honolulu, Hawaii.    You will be in one of these departments. Address your communication to  \"The Commanding General\" at his department headquarters.    Answer all official communications promptly. This is important. Letters  must be written, folded, signed as prescribed by the War Department.  Models illustrating the system are furnished by the Adjutant General's  office, Washington, D. C. \"Ind.\" is the"]]]
