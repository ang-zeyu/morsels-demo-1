See ye to that.\"    Then stood forth the big man and said:  \"He is a fair young knight, as  ye may see; and he rideth seeking adventures, and Roger did us to wit  that he was abiding in the Burg at his peril, and would have him away,  even if it were somewhat against his will:  and we were willing that it  should be so, all the more as I have a guess concerning what he is; and  a foreseeing man might think that luck should go with him.\" Therewith  he turned to Ralph and said:  \"How say ye, fair sir, will ye take  guesting with us a while and learn our ways?\"    Said Ralph:  \"Certain I am that whither ye will have me go, thither  must I; yet I deem that I have an errand that lies not your way.  Therefore if I go with you, ye must so look upon it that I am in your  fellowship as one compelled.  To be short with you, I crave leave to  depart and go mine own road.\"    As he spoke he saw the youth walking up and down in short turns; but  his face he could scarce see at all, what for his slouched hat, what  for his cloak; and at last he saw him go up to the tall man and speak  softly to him awhile.  The tall man nodded his head, and as the youth  drew right back nigh to the thicket, spake to Ralph again.    \"Fair sir, we grant thine asking; and add this thereto that we give  thee the man who has joined himself to thee, Roger of the Rope-walk to  wit, to help thee on the road, so that thou mayst not turn thy face  back to the Burg of the Four Friths, where thine errand, and thy life  withal, were soon sped now, or run into any other trap which the Wood  Perilous may have for thee.  And yet if thou think better of it, thou  mayst come with us straightway; for we have nought to do to tarry here  any longer.  And in any case, here is a good horse that we will give  thee, since thou hast lost thy steed; and Roger who rideth with thee,  he also is well horsed.\"    Ralph looked hard at the big man, who now had his salade thrown back  from his face, to see if he gave any token of jeering or malice, but  could see nought such:  nay, his face was grave and serious, not  ill-fashioned, though it were both long and broad like his body: his  cheek-bones somewhat high, his eyes grey and middling great, and  looking, as it were, far away.    Now deems Ralph that as for a trap of the Wood Perilous, he had already  fallen into the trap; for he scarce needed to be told that these were  men of the Dry Tree.  He knew also that it was Roger who had led him  into this trap, although he deemed it done with no malice against him.  So he said to himself that if he went with Roger he but went a  roundabout road to the Dry Tree; so that he was well nigh choosing to  go on with their company.  Yet again he thought that something might  well befall which would free him from that fellowship if he went with  Roger alone; whereas if he went with the others it was not that he  might be, but that he was already of the fellowship of the Dry Tree,  and most like would go straight thence to their stronghold.  So he  spake as soberly as the tall man had done.    \"Since ye give me the choice, fair sir, I will depart hence with Roger  alone, whom ye call my man, though to me he seemeth to be yours.  Howbeit, he has led me to you once, and belike will do so once more.\"    \"Yea,\" quoth the big man smiling no whit more than erst, \"and that will  make the fourth time.  Depart then, fair sir, and take this word with  thee that I wish thee good and not evil.\"        CHAPTER 16    Ralph Rideth the Wood Perilous Again      Now Roger led up to Ralph a strong horse, red roan of hue, duly  harnessed for war, and he himself had a good grey horse, and they  mounted at once, and Ralph rode slowly away through the wood at his  horse's will, for he was pondering all that had befallen him, and  wondering what next should hap.  Meanwhile those others had not  loitered, but were a-horseback at once, and went their ways from Ralph  through the wildwood.    Nought spake Ralph for a while till Roger came close up to him and  said: \"Whither shall we betake us, fair lord? hast thou an inkling of  the road whereon lies thine errand?\"    Now to Ralph this seemed but mockery, and he answered sharply: \"I wot  not, thou wilt lead whither thou wilt, even as thou hast trained me  hitherward with lies and a forged tale.  I suppose thou wilt lead me  now by some roundabout road to the stronghold of the Dry Tree.  It  matters little, since thou durst not lead me back into the Burg.  Yet  now I come to think of it, it is evil to be alone with a found out  traitor and liar; and I had belike have done better to go with their  company.\"    \"Nay nay,\" quoth Roger, \"thou art angry, and I marvel not thereat; but  let thy wrath run off thee if thou mayest; for indeed what I have told  thee of myself and my griefs is not all mere lying.  Neither was it any  lie that thou wert in peril of thy life amongst those tyrants of the  Burg; thou with thy manly bearing, and free tongue, and bred, as I  judge, to hate cruel deeds and injustice.  Such freedom they cannot  away with in that fellowship of hard men-at-arms; and soon hadst thou  come to harm amongst them.  And further, let alone that it is not ill  to be sundered from yonder company, who mayhap will have rough work to  do or ever they win home, I have nought to do to bring thee to Hampton  under Scaur if thou hast no will to go thither: though certes I would  lead thee some whither, whereof thou shalt ask me nought as now; yet  will I say thereof this much, that there thou shalt be both safe and  well at ease.  Now lastly know this, that whatever I have done, I have  done it to do thee good and not ill; and there is also another one,  whom I will not name to thee, who wisheth thee better yet, by the token  of those two strokes stricken by thee in the Wood Perilous before  yesterday was a day.\"    Now when Ralph heard those last words, such strong and sweet hope and  desire stirred in him to see that woman of the Want-ways of the Wood  Perilous that he forgat all else, except that he must nowise fall to  strife with Roger, lest they should sunder, and he should lose the help  of him, which he now deemed would bring him to sight of her whom he had  unwittingly come to long for more than aught else; so he spake to Roger  quietly and humbly: \"Well, faring-fellow, thou seest how I am little  more than a lad, and have fallen into matters mighty and perilous,  which I may not deal with of my own strength, at least until I get  nigher to them so that I may look them in the eyes, and strike a stroke  or two on them if they be at enmity with me.  So I bid thee lead me  whither thou wilt, and if thou be a traitor to me, on thine own head be  it; in good sooth, since I know nought of this wood and since I might  go astray and so come back to the Burg where be those whom thou hast  now made my foemen, I am content to take thee on thy word, and to hope  the best of thee, and ask no question of thee, save whitherward.\"    \"Fair sir,\" said Roger, \"away from this place at least; for we are as  yet over nigh to the Burg to be safe: but as to elsewhither we may  wend, thereof we may speak on the road as we have leisure.\"    Therewith he smote his horse with his heel and they went forward at a  smart trot, for the horses were unwearied, and the wood thereabouts of  beech and clear of underwood; and Roger seemed to know his way well,  and made no fumbling over it.    Four hours or more gone, the wood thinned and the beeches failed, and  they came to a country, still waste, of little low hills, stony for the  more part, beset with scraggy thorn-bushes, and here and there some  other berry-tree sown by the birds.  Then said Roger: \"Now I deem us  well out of the peril of them of the Burg, who if they follow the chase  as far as the sundering of us and the others, will heed our slot  nothing, but will follow on that of the company: so we may breathe our  horses a little, though their bait will be but small in this rough  waste:  therein we are better off than they, for lo you, saddle bags on  my nag and meat and drink therein.\"    So they lighted down and let their horses graze what they could, while  they ate and drank; amidst which Ralph again asked Roger of whither  they were going.  Said Roger:  \"I shall lead thee to a good harbour,  and a noble house of a master of mine, wherein thou mayst dwell certain  days, if thou hast a mind thereto, not without solace maybe.\"    \"And this master,\" said Ralph, \"is he of the Dry Tree?\" Said Roger:  \"I  scarce know how to answer thee without lying: but this I say, that  whether he be or not, this is true; amongst those men I have friends  and amongst them foes; but fate bindeth me to them for a while.\"  Said  Ralph reddening: \"Be there any women amongst them?\"  \"Yea, yea,\" quoth  Roger, smiling a little, \"doubt not thereof.\"    \"And that Lady of the Dry Tree,\" quoth Ralph, reddening yet more, but  holding up his head, \"that woman whereof the Burgher spoke so bitterly,  threatening her with torments and death if they might but lay hold of  her; what wilt thou tell me concerning her?\" \"But little,\" said Roger,  \"save this, that thou desirest to see her, and that thou mayest have  thy will thereon if thou wilt be guided by me.\"    Ralph hearkened as if he heeded little what Roger said; but presently  he rose up and walked to and fro in short turns with knit brows as one  pondering a hard matter.  He spake nought, and Roger seemed to heed him  nothing, though in sooth he looked at him askance from time to time,  till at last he came and lay down again by Roger, and in a while he  spake: \"I wot not why ye of the Dry Tree want me, or what ye will do  with me; and but for one thing I would even now ride away from thee at  all adventure.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#19)"],[1,"using too much fuel--\"    \"Make what?\" That was Ali up from the search of Kosti's quarters.  \"Nothing,\" he gave his report of what he had found there and then  returned to the earlier question. \"Make what?\"    Swiftly Dane outlined their suspicions--that the seat of the trouble lay  in the hydro and that they should clean out that section, drawing upon  emergency materials at the I-S E-Stat.    \"Sounds all right. But you know what they do to pirates?\" inquired the  Engineer-apprentice.    Space law came into Dane's field, he needed no prompting. \"Any ship in  emergency,\" he recited automatically, \"may claim supplies from the  nearest E-Stat--paying for them when the voyage is completed.\"    \"That means any Patrol E-Stat. The Companies' are private property.\"    \"But,\" Dane pointed out triumphantly, \"the law doesn't say so--there is  nothing about any difference between Company and Patrol E-Stat in the  law--\"    \"He's right,\" Rip agreed. \"That law was framed when only the Patrol had  such stations. Companies put them in later to save tax--remember? Legally  we're all right.\"    \"Unless the agents on duty raise a howl,\" Ali amended. \"Oh, don't give me  that look, Rip. I'm not sounding any warn-off on this, but I just want  you to be prepared to find a cruiser riding our fins and giving us the  hot flash as bandits. If you want to spoil the Eysies, I'm all for it.  Got a stat of theirs pinpointed?\"    Rip pointed to the figures on the computer. \"There she is. We can set  down in about five hours' ship time. How long will it take to strip the  hydro and re-install?\"    \"How can I tell?\" Ali sounded irritable. \"I can give you oxgy for  quarters for about two hours. Depends upon how fast we can move. No  telling until we make a start.\"    He started for the corridor and then added over his shoulder: \"You'll  have to answer a com challenge--thought about that?\"    \"Why?\" Rip asked. \"It might be com repairs bringing us in. They won't be  expecting trouble and we will--we'll have the advantage.\"    But Ali was not to be shaken out of his usual dim view of the future.  \"All right--so we land, blaster in hand, and take the place. And they get  off one little squeak to the Patrol. Well, a short life but an  interesting one. And we'll make all the Video channels for sure when we  go out with rockets blasting. Nothing like having a little excitement to  break the dull routine of a voyage.\"    \"We aren't going to, are we--\" Dane protested, \"land armed, I mean?\"    Ali stared at him and Rip, to Dane's surprise, did not immediately  repudiate that thought.    \"Sleep rods certainly,\" the Astrogator-apprentice said after a pause.  \"We'll have to be prepared for the moment when they find out who we are.  And you can't re-set a hydro in a few minutes, not when we have to keep  oxgy on for the others. If we were able to turn that off and work in  suits it'd be a quicker job--we could dump before we set down and then  pile it in at once. But this way it's going to be piece work. And it all  depends on the agents at the Stat whether we have trouble or not.\"    \"We had better break out the suits now,\" Ali added to Rip's estimate of  the situation. \"If we set down and pile out wearing suits at once it will  build up our tale of being poor wrecked spacemen--\"    Sleep rods or not, Dane thought to himself, the whole plan was one born  of desperation. It would depend upon who manned the E-Stat and how fast  the Free Traders could move once the Queen touched her fins to earth.    \"Knock out their coms,\" that was Ali continuing to plan. \"Do that first  and then we don't have to worry about someone calling in the Patrol.\"    Rip stretched. For the first time in hours he seemed to have returned to  his usual placid self. \"Good thing somebody in this spacer watches Video  serials--Ali, you can brief us on all the latest tricks of space pirates.  Nothing is so wildly improbable that you can't make use of it sometime  during a checkered career.\"    He glanced over the board before he brought his hand down on a single key  set a distance apart from the other controls. \"Put some local color into  it,\" was his comment.    Dane understood. Rip had turned on the distress signal at the Queen's  nose. When she set down on the Stat field she would be flaming a banner  of trouble. Next to the wan dead lights, set only when a ship had no hope  of ever reaching port at all, that signal was one every spacer dreaded  having to flash. But it was _not_ the dead lights--not yet for the Queen.    Working together they brought out the space suits and readied them at the  hatch. Then Weeks and Dane took up the task of tending their unconscious  charges while Rip and Ali prepared for landing.    There was no change in the sleepers. And in Jellico's cabin even Queex  appeared to be influenced by the plight of its master, for instead of  greeting Dane with its normal aspect of rage, the Hoobat stayed quiescent  on the floor of its cage, its top claws hooked about two of the wires,  its protruding eyes staring out into the room with what seemed closed to  a malignant intelligence. It did not even spit as Dane passed under its  abode to pour thin soup into his patient.    As for Sinbad, the cat had retreated to Dane's cabin and steadily refused  to leave the quarters he had chosen, resisting with tooth and claw the  one time Dane had tried to take him back to Van Rycke's office and his  own hammock there. Afterwards the Cargo-apprentice did not try to evict  him--there was comfort in seeing that plump gray body curled on the bunk  he had little chance to use.    His nursing duties performed for the moment, Dane ventured into the  hydro. He was practiced in tending this vital heart of the ship's air  supply. But outfitting a hydro was something else again. In his cadet  years he had aided in such a program at least twice as a matter of  learning the basic training of the Service. But then they had had  unlimited supplies to draw on and the action had taken place under no  more pressure than that exerted by the instructors. Now it was going to  be a far more tricky job--    He went slowly down the aisle between the banks of green things. Plants  from all over the Galaxy, grown for their contribution to the air  renewal--as well as side products such as fresh fruit and vegetables,  were banked there. The sweet odor of their verdant life was strong. But  how could any of the four now on duty tell what was rightfully there and  what might have been brought in? And could they be sure anything _had_  been introduced?    Dane stood there, his eyes searching those lines of greens--such a  mixture of greens from the familiar shade of Terra's fields to greens  tinged with shades first bestowed by other suns on other worlds--looking  for one which was alien enough to be noticeable. Only Mura, who knew  this garden as he knew his own cabin, could have differentiated between  them. They would just dump everything and trust to luck--    He was suddenly aware of a slight movement in the banks--a shivering of  stem, quiver of leaf. The mere act of his passing had set some sensitive  plant to register his presence. A lacy, fern-like thing was contracting  its fronds into balls. He should not stay--disturbing the peace of the  hydro. But it made little difference now--within a matter of hours all  this luxuriance would be thrust out to die and they would have to depend  upon canned oxgy and algae tanks. Too bad--the hydro represented much  time and labor on Mura's part and Tau had medical plants growing there he  had been observing for a long time.    As Dane closed the door behind him, seeing the line of balled fern which  had marked his passage, he heard a faint rustling, a sound as if a wind  had swept across the green room within. The imagination which was a  Trader's asset (when it was kept within bounds) suggested that the plants  inside guessed--With a frown for his own sentimentality, Dane strode down  the corridor and climbed to check with Rip in control.    The Astrogator-apprentice had his own problems. To bring the Queen down  on the circumscribed field of an E-Stat--without a guide beam to ride  in--since if they contacted the Stat they must reveal their _own_ com was  working and they would have to answer questions--was the sort of test  even a seasoned pilot would tense over. Yet Rip was sitting now in the  Captain's place, his broad hands spread out on the edge of the control  board waiting. And below in the engine room Ali was in Stotz's place  ready to fire and cut rockets at order. Of course they were both several  years ahead of him in Service, Dane knew. But he wondered at their quick  assumption of responsibility and whether he himself could ever reach  that point of self-confidence--his memory turning to the bad mistake he  had made on Sargol.    There was the sharp note of a warning gong, the flash of red light on the  control board. They were off automatic, from here on in it was all Kip's  work. Dane strapped down at the silent com-unit and was startled a moment  later when it spat words at him, translated from space code.    \"Identify--identify--I-S E-Stat calling spacer--identify--\"    So compelling was that demand that Dane's fingers went to the answer key  before he remembered and snatched them back, to fold his hands in his  lap.    \"Identify--\" the expressionless voice of the translator droned over their  heads.    Rip's hands were on the control board, playing the buttons there with the  precision of a musician creating some symphonic masterpiece. And the  Queen was alive, now quivering through her stout plates, coming into a  landing.    Dane watched the visa plate. The E-Stat asteroid was of a reasonable  size, but in their eyes it was a bleak, torn mote of stuff swimming  through vast emptiness.    \"Identify--\" the drone heightened in pitch.    Rip's lips were compressed, he made quick calculations. And Dane saw  that, though Jellico was the"]]]
