The  legs and lords look at each other, but no one likes to lead off. At  length a voice is heard offering to take nine to one he names the  winner. \"It's short odds, doing it cautiously. I'll take eight then,\" he  adds--\"sivin!\" but no one bites. \"What will anyone lay about Trick, by  Catton?\" inquires Jem Bland. \"I'll lay three to two again him. I'll  take two to one--two ponies to one, and give you a suv. for laying it.\"  \"Carn't\" is the answer. \"I'll do it, Jem,\" cries a voice. \"No, you  won't,\" from Bland, not liking his customer. Now they are all at it, and  what a hubbub there is! \"I'll back the field--I'll lay--I'll take--I'll  bet--ponies--fifties--hundreds--five hundred to two.\" \"What do you  want, my lord?\" \"Three to one against Trick, by Catton.\" \"Carn't afford  it--the odds really arn't that in the ring.\" \"Take two--two hundred to  one.\" \"No.\" \"Crockford, you'll do it for me?\" \"Yes, my lord. Twice over  if you like. Done, done.\" \"Do it again?\" \"No, thank you.\"    \"Trick, by Catton, don't start!\" cries a voice. \"Impossible!\" exclaim  his backers. \"Quite true, I'm just from the weighing-house, and----told  me so himself.\" \"Shame! shame!\" roar those who have backed him, and  \"honour--rascals--rogues--thieves--robbery--swindle--turf-ruined\"--fly  from tongue to tongue, but they are all speakers with never a speaker to  cry order. Meanwhile the lads have galloped by on their hacks with  the horses' cloths to the rubbing-house, and the horses have actually  started, and are now visible in the distance sweeping over the open  heath, apparently without guide or beacon.    The majority of the ring rush to the white judge's box, and have just  time to range themselves along the rude stakes and ropes that guard the  run in, and the course-keeper in a shooting-jacket on a rough pony  to crack his whip, and cry to half a dozen stable-lads to \"clear the  course,\" before the horses come flying towards home. Now all is tremor;  hope and fear vacillating in each breast. Silence stands breathless with  expectation--all eyes are riveted--the horses come within descrying  distance--\"beautiful!\" three close together, two behind. \"Clear the  course! clear the course! pray clear the course!\" \"Polly Hopkins! Polly  Hopkins!\" roar a hundred voices as they near. \"O, Fy! O, Fy!\" respond an  equal number. \"The horse! the horse!\" bellow a hundred more, as though  their yells would aid his speed, as Polly Hopkins, O, Fy! and Talleyrand  rush neck-and-neck along the cords and pass the judge's box. A cry of  \"dead heat!\" is heard. The bystanders see as suits their books, and  immediately rush to the judge's box, betting, bellowing, roaring,  and yelling the whole way. \"What's won? what's won? what's won?\" is  vociferated from a hundred voices. \"Polly Hopkins! Polly Hopkins! Polly  Hopkins!\" replies Mr. Clark with judicial dignity. \"By how much? by how  much?\" \"Half a head--half a head,\" [18] replies the same functionary.  \"What's second?\" \"O, Fy!\" and so, amid the song of \"Pretty, pretty Polly  Hopkins,\" from the winners, and curses and execrations long, loud, and  deep, from the losers, the scene closes.    The admiring winners follow Polly to the rubbing-house, while the losing  horses are left in the care of their trainers and stable-boys, who  console themselves with hopes of \"better luck next time.\"    After a storm comes a calm, and the next proceeding is the wheeling of  the judge's box, and removal of the old stakes and ropes to another  course on a different part of the heath, which is accomplished by a few  ragged rascals, as rude and uncouth as the furniture they bear. In less  than half an hour the same group of anxious careworn countenances are  again turned upon each other at the betting-post, as though they had  never separated. But see! the noble owner of Trick, by Catton, is in the  crowd, and Jem Bland eyeing him like a hawk. \"I say, Waggey,\" cries he  (singling out a friend stationed by his lordship), \"had you ought on  Trick, by Catton?\" \"No, Jem,\" roars Wagstaff, shaking his head, \"I knew  my man too well.\" \"Why now, Waggey, do you know I wouldn't have done  such a thing for the world! no, not even to have been made a Markiss!\"  a horse-laugh follows this denunciation, at which the newly created  marquis bites his livid lips.    [Footnote 18: No judge ever gave a race as won by half a head; but we let  the whole passage stand as originally written.--EDITOR.]    The Baron, who appears to have no taste for walking, still sticks to the  punch mare, which Mr. Jorrocks steers to the newly formed ring aided by  the Baron and the furze-bush. Here they come upon Sam Spring, whose boy  has just brought his spring-cart to bear upon the ring formed by the  horsemen, and thinking it a pity a nobleman of any county should be  reduced to the necessity of riding double, very politely offers to  take one into his carriage. Jorrocks accepts the offer, and forthwith  proceeds to make himself quite at home in it. The chorus again  commences, and Jorrocks interrogates Sam as to the names of the  brawlers. \"Who be that?\" said he, \"offering to bet a thousand to a  hundred.\" Spring, after eyeing him through his spectacles, with a  grin and a look of suspicion replies, \"Come now--come--let's have no  nonsense--you know as well as I.\" \"Really,\" replies Mr. Jorrocks most  earnestly, \"I don't.\" \"Why, where have you lived all your life?\"  \"First part of it with my grandmother at Lisson Grove, afterwards at  Camberwell, but now I resides in Great Coram Street, Russell Square--a  werry fashionable neighbourhood.\" \"Oh, I see,\" replies Sam, \"you are one  of the reg'lar city coves, then--now, what brings you here?\" \"Just to  say that I have been at Newmarket, for I'm blowed if ever you catch  me here again.\" \"That's a pity,\" replied Sam, \"for you look like a  promising man--a handsome-bodied chap in the face--don't you sport any?\"  \"O a vast!--'unt regularly--I'm a member of the Surrey 'unt--capital one  it is too--best in England by far.\" \"What do you hunt?\" inquired Sam.  \"Foxes, to be sure.\" \"And are they good eating?\" \"Come,\" replied  Jorrocks, \"you know, as well as I do, we don't eat 'em.\" The dialogue  was interrupted by someone calling to Sam to know what he was backing.    \"The Bedlamite colt, my lord,\" with a forefinger to his hat. \"Who's  that?\" inquired Jorrocks. \"That's my Lord L----, a baron-lord--and a  very nice one--best baron-lord I know--always bets with me--that's  another baron-lord next him, and the man next him is a baron-knight, a  stage below a baron-lord--something between a nobleman and a gentleman.\"  \"And who be that stout, good-looking man in a blue coat and velvet  collar next him, just rubbing his chin with the race card--he'll be a  lord too, I suppose?\" \"No,--that's Mr. Gully, as honest a man as ever  came here,--that's Crockford before him. The man on the right is  Mr. C----, who they call the 'cracksman,' because formerly he was a  professional housebreaker, but he has given up that trade, and turned  gentleman, bets, and keeps a gaming-table. This little ugly black-faced  chap, that looks for all the world like a bilious Scotch terrier,  has lately come among us. He was a tramping pedlar--sold worsted  stockings--attended country courses, and occasionally bet a pair. Now he  bets thousands of pounds, and keeps racehorses. The chaps about him  all covered with chains and rings and brooches, were in the duffing  line--sold brimstoned sparrows for canary-birds, Norwich shawls for real  Cashmere, and dried cabbage-leaves for cigars. Now each has a first-rate  house, horses and carriages, and a play-actress among them. Yon chap,  with the extravagantly big mouth, is a cabinet-maker at Cambridge. He'll  bet you a thousand pounds as soon as look at you.\"    \"The chap on the right of the post with the red tie, is the son of an  ostler. He commenced betting thousands with a farthing capital. The man  next him, all teeth and hair, like a rat-catcher's dog, is an Honourable  by birth, but not very honourable in his nature.\" \"But see,\" cried Mr.  Jorrocks, \"Lord---- is talking to the Cracksman.\" \"To be sure,\" replies  Sam, \"that's the beauty of the turf. The lord and the leg are reduced to  an equality. Take my word for it, if you have a turn for good society,  you should come upon the turf.--I say, my Lord Duke!\" with all five  fingers up to his hat, \"I'll lay you three to two on the Bedlamite  colt.\" \"Done, Mr. Spring,\" replies his Grace, \"three ponies to two.\"  \"There!\" cried Mr. Spring, turning to Jorrocks, \"didn't I tell you so?\"  The riot around the post increases. It is near the moment of starting,  and the legs again become clamorous for what they want. Their vehemence  increases. Each man is _in extremis_. \"They are off!\" cries one. \"No,  they are not,\" replies another. \"False start,\" roars a third. \"Now they  come!\" \"No, they don't!\" \"Back again.\" They are off at last, however,  and away they speed over the flat. The horses come within descrying  distance. It's a beautiful race--run at score the whole way, and only  two tailed off within the cords. Now they set to--whips and spurs go,  legs leap, lords shout, and amid the same scene of confusion, betting,  galloping, cursing, swearing, and bellowing, the horses rush past the  judge's box.    But we have run our race, and will not fatigue our readers with  repetition. Let us, however, spend the evening, and then the \"Day at  Newmarket\" will be done.    Mr. Spring, with his usual attention to strangers, persuades Mr.  Jorrocks to make one of a most agreeable dinner-party at the \"White  Hart\" on the assurance of spending a delightful evening. Covers are laid  for sixteen in the front room downstairs, and about six o'clock that  number are ready to sit down.

While I was thus employed by my master I was often a witness to  cruelties of every kind, which were exercised on my unhappy fellow  slaves. I used frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in  my care for sale; and it was almost a constant practice with our  clerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the  chastity of the female slaves; and these I was, though with  reluctance, obliged to submit to at all times, being unable to help  them. When we have had some of these slaves on board my master's  vessels to carry them to other islands, or to America, I have known  our mates to commit these acts most shamefully, to the disgrace, not  of Christians only, but of men. I have even known them gratify their  brutal passion with females not ten years old; and these abominations  some of them practised to such scandalous excess, that one of our  captains discharged the mate and others on that account. And yet in  Montserrat I have seen a negro man staked to the ground, and cut most  shockingly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, because he had been  connected with a white woman who was a common prostitute: as if it  were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent African girl of her  virtue; but most heinous in a black man only to gratify a passion of  nature, where the temptation was offered by one of a different colour,  though the most abandoned woman of her species. Another negro man was  half hanged, and then burnt, for attempting to poison a cruel  overseer. Thus by repeated cruelties are the wretched first urged to  despair, and then murdered, because they still retain so much of human  nature about them as to wish to put an end to their misery, and  retaliate on their tyrants! These overseers are indeed for the most  part persons of the worst character of any denomination of men in the  West Indies. Unfortunately, many humane gentlemen, by not residing on  their estates, are obliged to leave the management of them in the  hands of these human butchers, who cut and mangle the slaves in a  shocking manner on the most trifling occasions, and altogether treat  them in every respect like brutes. They pay no regard to the situation  of pregnant women, nor the least attention to the lodging of the  field negroes. Their huts, which ought to be well covered, and the  place dry where they take their little repose, are often open sheds,  built in damp places; so that, when the poor creatures return tired  from the toils of the field, they contract many disorders, from being  exposed to the damp air in this uncomfortable state, while they are  heated, and their pores are open. This neglect certainly conspires  with many others to cause a decrease in the births as well as in the  lives of the grown negroes. I can quote many instances of gentlemen  who reside on their estates in the West Indies, and then the scene is  quite changed; the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care, by  which their lives are prolonged, and their masters are profited. To  the honour of humanity, I knew several gentlemen who managed their  estates in this manner; and they found that benevolence was their true  interest. And, among many I could mention in several of the islands, I  knew one in Montserrat[R] whose slaves looked remarkably well, and  never needed any fresh supplies of negroes; and there are many other  estates, especially in Barbadoes, which, from such judicious  treatment, need no fresh stock of negroes at any time. I have the  honour of knowing a most worthy and humane gentleman, who is a native  of Barbadoes, and has estates there[S]. This gentleman has written a  treatise on the usage of his own slaves. He allows them two hours for  refreshment at mid-day; and many other indulgencies and comforts,  particularly in their lying; and, besides this, he raises more  provisions on his estate than they can destroy; so that by these  attentions he saves the lives of his negroes, and keeps them healthy,  and as happy as the condition of slavery can admit. I myself, as shall  appear in the sequel, managed an estate, where, by those attentions,  the negroes were uncommonly cheerful and healthy, and did more work by  half than by the common mode of treatment they usually do. For want,  therefore, of such care and attention to the poor negroes, and  otherwise oppressed as they are, it is no wonder that the decrease  should require 20,000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant  places of the dead.    Even in Barbadoes, notwithstanding those humane exceptions which I  have mentioned, and others I am acquainted with, which justly make it  quoted as a place where slaves meet with the best treatment, and need  fewest recruits of any in the West Indies, yet this island requires  1000 negroes annually to keep up the original stock, which is only  80,000. So that the whole term of a negro's life may be said to be  there but sixteen years![T] And yet the climate here is in every  respect the same as that from which they are taken, except in being  more wholesome. Do the British colonies decrease in this manner? And  yet what a prodigious difference is there between an English and West  India climate?    While I was in Montserrat I knew a negro man, named Emanuel Sankey,  who endeavoured to escape from his miserable bondage, by concealing  himself on board of a London ship: but fate did not favour the poor  oppressed man; for, being discovered when the vessel was under sail,  he was delivered up again to his master. This Christian master  immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wrist and  ancle, and then took some sticks of sealing wax, and lighted them, and  droped it all over his back. There was another master who was noted  for cruelty; and I believe he had not a slave but what had been cut,  and had pieces fairly taken out of the flesh: and, after they had been  punished thus, he used to make them get into a long wooden box or case  he had for that purpose, in which he shut them up during pleasure. It  was just about the height and breadth of a man; and the poor wretches  had no room, when in the case, to move.    It was very common in several of the islands, particularly in St.  Kitt's, for the slaves to be branded with the initial letters of their  master's name; and a load of heavy iron hooks hung about their necks.  Indeed on the most trifling occasions they were loaded with chains;  and often instruments of torture were added. The iron muzzle,  thumb-screws, &c. are so well known, as not to need a description, and  were sometimes applied for the slightest faults. I have seen a negro  beaten till some of his bones were broken, for even letting a pot boil  over. Is it surprising that usage like this should drive the poor  creatures to despair, and make them seek a refuge in death from those  evils which render their lives intolerable--while,        \"With shudd'ring horror pale, and eyes aghast,      They view their lamentable lot, and find      No rest!\"    This they frequently do. A negro-man on board a vessel of my master,  while I belonged to her, having been put in irons for some trifling  misdemeanor, and kept in that state for some days, being weary of  life, took an opportunity of jumping overboard into the sea; however,  he was picked up without being drowned. Another, whose life was also a  burden to him, resolved to starve himself to death, and refused to eat  any victuals; this procured him a severe flogging: and he also, on the  first occasion which offered, jumped overboard at Charles Town, but  was saved.    Nor is there any greater regard shewn to the little property than  there is to the persons and lives of the negroes. I have already  related an instance or two of particular oppression out of many which  I have witnessed; but the following is frequent in all the islands.  The wretched field-slaves, after toiling all the day for an unfeeling  owner, who gives them but little victuals, steal sometimes a few  moments from rest or refreshment to gather some small portion of  grass, according as their time will admit. This they commonly tie up  in a parcel; (either a bit, worth six pence; or half a bit's-worth)  and bring it to town, or to the market, to sell. Nothing is more  common than for the white people on this occasion to take the grass  from them without paying for it; and not only so, but too often also,  to my knowledge, our clerks, and many others, at the same time have  committed acts of violence on the poor, wretched, and helpless  females; whom I have seen for hours stand crying to no purpose, and  get no redress or pay of any kind. Is not this one common and crying  sin enough to bring down God's judgment on the islands? He tells us  the oppressor and the oppressed are both in his hands; and if these  are not the poor, the broken-hearted, the blind, the captive, the  bruised, which our Saviour speaks of, who are they? One of these  depredators once, in St. Eustatia, came on board of our vessel, and  bought some fowls and pigs of me; and a whole day after his departure  with the things he returned again and wanted his money back: I refused  to give it; and, not seeing my captain on board, he began the common  pranks with me; and swore he would even break open my chest and take  my money. I therefore expected, as my captain was absent, that he  would be as good as his word: and he was just proceeding to strike me,  when fortunately a British seaman on board, whose heart had not been  debauched by a West India climate, interposed and prevented him. But  had the cruel man struck me I certainly should have defended myself at  the hazard of my life; for what is life to a man thus oppressed? He  went away, however,"]]]
