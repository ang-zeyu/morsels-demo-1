In the first place, on the extreme right, and  issuing from Gallicia, on Drogiczin, Prince Schwartzenberg and 34,000  Austrians; on their left, coming from Warsaw, and marching on Bialystok  and Grodno, the King of Westphalia, at the head of 79,200 Westphalians,  Saxons, and Poles; by the side of them was the Viceroy of Italy, who had  just effected the junction, near Marienpol and Pilony, of 79,500  Bavarians, Italians and French; next, the emperor, with 220,000 men,  commanded by the King of Naples, the Prince of Eckmuehl, the Dukes of  Dantzic, Istria, Reggio, and Elchingen. They advanced from Thorn,  Marienwerder, and Elbing, and, on the 23d of June, had assembled in a  single mass near Nogarisky, a league above Kowno. Finally, in front of  Tilsit, was Macdonald, and 32,500 Prussians, Bavarians, and Poles,  composing the extreme left of the grand army.    Every thing was now ready. From the banks of the Guadalquivir, and the  shores of the Calabrian sea, to the Vistula, were assembled 617,000 men,  of whom 480,000 were already present; one siege and six bridge  equipages, thousands of provision-waggons, innumerable herds of oxen,  1372 pieces of cannon, and thousands of artillery and hospital-waggons,  had been directed, assembled, and stationed at a short distance from the  Russian frontier river. The greatest part of the provision-waggons were  alone behind.    Sixty thousand Austrians, Prussians, and Spaniards, were preparing to  shed their blood for the conqueror of Wagram, of Jena, and of Madrid;  for the man who had four times beaten down the power of Austria, who had  humbled Prussia, and invaded Spain. And yet all were faithful to him.  When it was considered that one-third of the army of Napoleon was either  foreign to him or hostile, one hardly knew at which most to be  astonished,--the audacity of one party, or the resignation of the other.  It was in this manner that Rome made her conquests contribute to her  future means for conquering.    As to us Frenchmen, he found us all full of ardour. Habit, curiosity,  and the pleasure of exhibiting themselves in the character of masters in  new countries, actuated the soldiers; vanity was the great stimulant of  the younger ones, who thirsted to acquire some glory which they might  recount, with the attractive quackery peculiar to soldiers; these  inflated and pompous narratives of their exploits being moreover  indispensable to their relaxation when no longer under arms. To this  must certainly be added, the hope of plunder; for the exacting ambition  of Napoleon had as often disgusted his soldiers, as the disorders of the  latter tarnished his glory. A compromise was necessary: ever since 1805,  there was a sort of mutual understanding, on his part to wink at their  plunder--on theirs, to suffer his ambition.    This plunder, however, or rather, this marauding system, was generally  confined to provisions, which, in default of supplies, were exacted of  the inhabitants, but often too extravagantly. The most culpable  plunderers were the stragglers, who are always numerous in frequent  forced marches. These disorders, indeed, were never tolerated. In order  to repress them, Napoleon left _gendarmes_ and flying columns on the  track of the army; and when these stragglers subsequently rejoined their  corps, their knapsacks were examined by their officers; or, as was the  case at Austerlitz, by their comrades; and strict justice was then  executed among themselves.    The last levies were certainly too young and too feeble; but the army  had still a stock of brave and experienced men, used to critical  situations, and whom nothing could intimidate. They were recognizable at  the first glance by their martial countenances, and by their  conversation; they had no other past nor future but war; and they could  talk of nothing else. Their officers were worthy of them, or at least  were becoming so; for, in order to preserve the due authority of their  rank over such men, it was necessary for them to have wounds to show,  and to be able to appeal to their own exploits.    Such was, at that period, the life of those men; all was action within  its sphere, even to words. They often boasted too much, but even that  had its advantage; for as they were incessantly put to the proof, it was  then necessary for them to be what they wished to appear. Such  especially is the character of the Poles; they boast in the first  instance of being more than they have been, but not more than they are  capable of being. Poland in fact is a nation of heroes! pawning their  words for exploits beyond the truth, but subsequently redeeming them  with honour, in order to verify what at first was neither true nor even  probable.    As to the old generals, some of them were no longer the hardy and simple  warriors of the republic; honours, hard service, age, and the emperor  particularly, had contributed to soften many of them down. Napoleon  compelled them to adopt a luxurious style of living by his example and  his orders; according to him, it was a means of influencing the  multitude. It might be also, that such habits prevented them from  accumulating property, which might have made them independent; for,  being himself the source of riches, he was glad to to keep up the  necessity of repairing to it, and in this manner to bring them back  within his influence. He had, therefore, pushed his generals into a  circle from which it was difficult to escape; forcing them to pass  incessantly from want to prodigality, and from prodigality to want,  which he alone was able to relieve.    Several had nothing but their appointments, which accustomed them to an  ease of living with which they could no longer dispense. If he made them  grants of land, it was out of his conquests, which were exposed to  insecurity by war, and which war only could preserve.    But in order to retain them in dependence, glory, which with some was a  habit, with others a passion, with all a want, was the all-sufficient  stimulant; and Napoleon, absolute master as he was of his own century,  and even dictating to history, was the distributor of that glory. Though  he fixed it at a high price, there was no rejecting his conditions; one  would have felt ashamed to confess one's weakness in presence of his  strength, and to stop short before a man whose ambition was still  mounting, great as was the elevation which he had already attained.    Besides, the renown of so great an expedition was full of charm; its  success seemed certain; it promised to be nothing but a military march  to Petersburgh and Moscow. With this last effort his wars would probably  be terminated. It was a last opportunity, which one would repent to have  let escape; one would be annoyed by the glorious narratives which others  would give of it. The victory of to-day would make that of yesterday so  old! And who would wish to grow old with it?    And then, when war was kindled in all quarters, how was it possible to  avoid it? The scenes of action were not indifferent; here Napoleon would  command in person; elsewhere, though the cause might be the same, the  contest would be carried on under a different commander. The renown  shared with the latter would be foreign to Napoleon, on whom,  nevertheless, depended glory, fortune, every thing; and it was well  known, whether from preference or policy, that he was only profuse in  his favours to those whose glory was identified with his glory; and that  he rewarded less generously such exploits as were not his. It was  requisite, therefore, to serve in the army which he commanded; hence the  anxiety of young and old to fill its ranks. What chief had ever before  so many means of power? There was no hope which he could not flatter,  excite, or satiate.    Finally, we loved him as the companion of our labours; as the chief who  had conducted us to renown. The astonishment and admiration which he  inspired flattered our self-love; for all these we shared in common with  him.    With respect to that youthful _elite_, which in those times of glory  filled our camps, its enthusiasm was natural. Who is there amongst us  who, in his early years, has not been fired by the perusal of the  warlike exploits of the ancients and of our ancestors? Should we not  have all desired, at that time, to be the heroes whose real or  fictitious history we were perusing? During that state of enthusiasm, if  those recollections had been suddenly realized before us; if our eyes,  instead of reading, had witnessed the performance of those wonders; if  we had felt their sphere of action within our reach, and if employments  had been offered to us by the side of those brave paladins, whose  adventurous lives and brilliant renown our young and vivid imaginations  had so much envied; which of us would have hesitated? Who is there that  would not have rushed forward, replete with joy and hope, and disdaining  an odious and scandalous repose?    Such were the rising generations of that day. At that period every one  was free to be ambitious! a period of intoxication and prosperity,  during which the French soldier, lord of all things by victory,  considered himself greater than the nobleman, or even the sovereign,  whose states he traversed! To him it appeared as if the kings of Europe  only reigned by permission of his chief and of his arms.    Thus it was that habit attracted some, disgust at camp service others;  novelty prompted the greater part, and especially the thirst of glory:  but all were stimulated by emulation. In fine, confidence in a chief who  had been always fortunate, and hope of an early victory, which would  terminate the war at a blow, and restore us to our firesides; for a war,  to the entire army of Napoleon (as it was to some volunteers of the  court of Louis XIV.) was often no more than a single battle, or a short  and brilliant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#19)"],[1,"marches against Yorktown, and takes it and the army  of Cornwallis.--Washington, with his army, was then near New York  City, watching the British there. The French king had done as he  agreed, and had sent over warships and soldiers to help us; but so  far they had never been able to do much. Now was the chance. Before  the British knew what Washington was about, he had sent the French  war-ships down to Yorktown to prevent Cornwallis from getting away  by sea. Then, with his own army and some French soldiers besides,  Washington quickly marched south to attack Yorktown by land.    When he got there he placed his cannon round the town, and began  battering it to pieces. For more than a week he kept firing night  and day. One house had over a thousand balls go through it. Its walls  looked like a sieve. At last Cornwallis could not hold out any longer,  and on October 19th, 1781, his army came out and gave themselves up  as prisoners.    The Americans formed a line more than a mile long on one side of the  road, and the French stood facing them on the other side. The French  had on gay clothes, and looked very handsome; the clothes of  Washington's men were patched and faded, but their eyes shone with  a wonderful light--the light of victory. The British marched out  slowly, between the two lines: somehow they found it pleasanter to  look at the bright uniforms of the French, than to look at the eyes  of the Americans.    [Illustration: THE FLAGS OF THE REVOLUTION.[34]]    [Footnote 34: The flag with the large crosses on it, on the left,  is the English flag at the time of the American Revolution. The flag  on the right is that which Washington raised at Cambridge,  Massachusetts, January 2d, 1776. He simply took the English flag,  and added thirteen stripes to represent the union of the thirteen  English colonies. The flag in the centre, with its thirteen stars  and thirteen stripes representing the thirteen states, is the first  American _national_ flag. It was adopted by Congress June 14th, 1777,  not quite a year after we had declared ourselves independent of Great  Britain. Beneath this flag is Washington's coat of arms with a Latin  motto, meaning \"The event justifies the deed.\" It is possible that  the stars and stripes on our national flag came from the stars and  stripes (or bars) on this ancient coat of arms, which may be seen  on the tombstone of one of the Washington family, buried in 1583,  in the parish church at Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England.]      143. How the news of the taking of Yorktown was carried to  Philadelphia; Lord Fairfax.--People at a distance noticed that the  cannon had suddenly stopped firing. They looked at each other, and  asked, \"What does it mean?\" All at once a man appears on horseback.  He is riding with all his might toward Philadelphia, where Congress  is. As he dashes past, he rises in his stirrups, swings his cap, and  shouts with all his might, \"Cornwallis is taken! Cornwallis is  taken!\" Then it was the people's turn to shout; and they made the  hills ring with, \"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\"    [Illustration: \"CORNWALLIS IS TAKEN!\"]    Poor Lord Fairfax,[35] Washington's old friend, had always stood by  the king. He was now over ninety. When he heard the cry, \"Cornwallis  is taken!\" it was too much for the old man. He said to his negro  servant, \"Come, Joe; carry me to bed, for I'm sure it's high time  for me to die.\"    [Footnote 35: See paragraph 126.]      144. Tearing down the British flag at New York; Washington goes back  to Mount Vernon; he is elected President; his death; Lafayette visits  his tomb.--The Revolutionary War had lasted seven years,--terrible  years they were, years of sorrow, suffering, and death,--but now the  end had come, and America was free. When the British left New York  City, they nailed the British flag to a high pole on the wharf; but  a Yankee sailor soon climbed the pole, tore down the flag of England,  and hoisted the stars and stripes in its place. That was more than  a hundred years ago. Now the English and the Americans have become  good friends, and the English people see that the Revolution ended  in the way that was best for both of us.    [Illustration: HOISTING THE STARS AND STRIPES AT NEW YORK.]    When it was clear that there would be no more fighting, Washington  went back to Mount Vernon. He hoped to spend the rest of his life  there. But the country needed him, and a few years later it chose  him the first President of the United States.    [Illustration: PRESIDENT WASHINGTON'S COACH.]    Washington was made President in New York City, which was the capital  of the United States at that time. A French gentleman who was there  tells us how Washington, standing in the presence of thousands of  people, placed his hand on the Bible, and solemnly swore that with  the help of God he would protect and defend the United States of  America.    [Illustration: PRESIDENT WASHINGTON TAKING THE OATH.]    Washington was elected President twice. When he died many of the  people in England and France joined America in mourning for him; for  all men honored his memory.    Lafayette came over to visit us many years afterward. He went to Mount  Vernon, where Washington was buried. There he went down into the  vault, and, kneeling by the side of the coffin, covered his face with  his hands, and shed tears of gratitude to think that he had known  such a man as Washington, and that Washington had been his friend.

Daniel Boone; what the hunters of the west did; Boone's life  in North Carolina.--Before Washington began to fight the battles of  the Revolution in the east, Daniel Boone and other famous hunters  were fighting bears and Indians in what was then called the west.  By that war in the woods, these brave and hardy men helped us to get  possession of that part of the country.    Daniel Boone was born in Pennsylvania.[1] His father moved to North  Carolina,[2] and Daniel helped him cut down the trees round their  log cabin in the forest. He ploughed the land, which was thick with  stumps, hoed the corn that grew up among those stumps, and then,--as  there was no mill near,--he pounded it into meal for \"johnny-cake.\"  He learned how to handle a gun quite as soon as he did a hoe. The  unfortunate deer or coon that saw young Boone coming toward him knew  that he had seen his best days, and that he would soon have the whole  Boone family sitting round him at the dinner-table.
