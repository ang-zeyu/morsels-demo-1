As described in the preceding chapter, the Second Rondo-form contains  two digressions from the Principal theme, called respectively the first  and second Subordinate themes.  It bears the same relation to the  Five-Part Song-form, that the First Rondo-form bears to the Three-Part  Song-form.    For the sake of effective contrast, _the two Subordinate themes are  generally differentiated_ to a marked degree; more precisely stated,  the _second_ Subordinate theme is likely to differ strikingly both from  the Principal theme and from the first Subordinate theme; the result is  that, as a general rule, the second digression is more emphatic than  the first.    To prevent the enlarged design from assuming too great dimensions, the  several themes are apt to be more concise than in the first Rondo-form;  the Two-Part form is therefore more common than the Three-Part; the  first Subordinate theme is generally brief, and the Principal theme  upon its recurrences, is frequently abbreviated,--especially the last  one, which often merges in the coda.    An example of the second Rondo-form (which may be sufficiently  illustrated without notes) will be found in the last movement of  Beethoven's pianoforte sonata, op. 49, No. 2 (G major).  Number the one  hundred and twenty measures, and define the factors of the form with  close reference to the following indications--the figures in  parenthesis denoting the measures:    _Principal theme_.  Part I (1-8), period-form; Part II (9-12), phrase;  Part III (13-20), period-form.    _Transition_, period-form (21-27), leading into the new key.    _First Subordinate theme_, period-form (28-36), with    _Codetta_, repeated (37-42).    _Re-transition_ (43-47).    _Principal theme_, as before (48-67).    _Second Subordinate theme_, double-period (68-83); the process of  _Re-transition_ manifests its inception about one measure before (82),  and is carried on to measure 87.    _Principal theme_, as before (88-107).    _Coda_, period, with modified repetition of consequent phrase  (108-119),--followed by an extra perfect cadence, as extension.      LESSON 14.--Analyze the following examples, as usual.  Review the  directions given in Lesson 13:--    Beethoven, pianoforte sonatas: op. 10, No. 3, last movement.    Op. 14, No. 2, last movement (called _Scherzo_).    Op. 79, last movement (very concise).    Op. 13, _Adagio_ (still more concise.  Is this not a Five-Part  Song-form?)    Beethoven, _Polonaise_ for the pianoforte, op. 89.    Mozart, _Rondo_ in A minor, for pianoforte.          CHAPTER XV.  THE THIRD RONDO-FORM.    In this form of composition there are three digressions from the  Principal theme.  But, in order to avert the excess of variety, so  imminent in a design of such length, the digressions are so planned  that _the third one corresponds to the first_.  That is, there are here  again only two Subordinate themes (as in the Second Rondo-form), which  alternate with each other, so that the succession of thematic factors  is as follows: Principal Theme; 1st Subordinate Theme; Principal Theme;  2d Subordinate Theme; Principal Theme; 1st Subordinate Theme; Principal  Theme; and coda.    It will be observed that this arrangement is another confirmation and  embodiment of the Three-Part (tripartite) form, with its \"recurrence of  the first section,\" magnified into larger proportions than any examples  thus far seen.  The three portions are called, _Divisions_.  The first  is known as the _Exposition_, comprising the Principal Theme, First  Subordinate Theme, and recurrence of the Principal Theme; the second  division consists of the Second Subordinate Theme only; the Third  Division is the _Recapitulation_ of the first Division.      THE EXPOSITION.--This first Division, the \"statement,\" compounded of  two themes and a recurrence, is in itself a complete (though probably  very concise) First Rondo-form; therefore, in order to confirm the  intended design, at least one of its themes must contain two (or more)  Parts,--otherwise it would be no more, all together, than a Three-Part  Song-form, and the _whole_ Rondo would be reduced to the design of the  First Rondo-form.  In a word, the Exposition must correspond concisely  to the table given on page 108.  The First Subordinate theme takes its  usual emphatic position in a different key,--generally closely related  to the key of the Principal theme.    Sometimes, but by no means regularly, the Exposition closes with a  decisive perfect cadence in the original key.    The Middle Division.--As this should balance (at least approximately),  the Exposition, it is likely to be a fairly broad design,--not greater,  however, than a Three-Part Song-form (possibly with repetitions), and  often no more than a Two-Part form.  As intimated in the preceding  chapter, the Second Subordinate theme is usually strongly contrasted  with the other themes, in character, key, and length; but the same  unity of total effect is necessary, as in the smaller Rondo-forms.  The  re-transition (or returning passage) is often quite lengthy and  elaborate; it is seldom an independent section of the form, however,  but generally developed out of the last phrase of the theme, by the  process of \"dissolution,\"--to be explained more fully in Chapter XVII.      THE RECAPITULATION.--This corresponds, theoretically, to the _da capo_  in the Song with Trio, or to the variated recurrence of the Principal  theme in the First Rondo-form.  But it is more than either of these.  The term \"Recapitulation\" is more comprehensive than \"recurrence\" (in  the sense in which we have thus far employed the latter word), as it  always refers to the reproduction of a _collection_ of themes, and,  chiefly on this account, is subject to certain specific conditions of  technical treatment.    Recapitulation, in the larger designs of composition, _invariably  involves transposition_, or change of key,--the transposition of the  First Subordinate theme, from the key chosen for its first announcement  (in the Exposition) back _to the principal key_ of the piece.   This,  as may be inferred, greatly affects the original transition and  re-transition; and it may necessitate changes within the theme itself,  in consequence of the change of register.    Further, the last recurrence of the Principal theme being no less than  its fourth announcement, is rarely complete; as a rule, a brief  intimation (the first motive or phrase) is deemed sufficient, and this  is then dissolved into the coda; or the Principal theme, as such, is  omitted, or affiliated with the coda, or one of its sections.    {119}    For an illustration of the Third Rondo-form, the student is referred to  the last movement of Beethoven's pianoforte sonata, op. 2, No. 2, the  diagram of which is as follows:--                                _Middle_        _Exposition._        _Division_          _Recapitulation._   ------------------------  ----------  ----------------------------------   Pr.Th. 1stSub.Th.

A maj.      For its detailed analysis, number the measures as usual (there are 187,  the \"second ending\" not being counted), and define each factor of the  form by reference to the given indications,--the figures in parenthesis  again denoting the measures:--    _Principal Theme_, Part I (1-8), period-form.  Part II (9-12), phrase.  Part III (13-16), phrase.    _Transition_, period-form (17-26), leading into the new key.    _First Sub. Theme_, period, Antecedent (27-32), Consequent (33-39).    _Re-transition_ (40).    _Principal Theme_, as before, (41-56).  This ends the EXPOSITION.    _Second Sub. Theme_, Part I (57-66), period, literal repetition.  Part  II (67-74) period-form.  Part III (75-79) phrase.    Parts II and III repeated (80-92); the process of _re-transition_  begins one measure earlier (91), and is pursued to measure 99.    The RECAPITULATION begins in the next measure with the    _Principal Theme_, as before, slightly modified (100-115).    _Transition_, as before, slightly abbreviated (116-123).    _First Subordinate Theme_, as before, but transposed to the principal  key, A major, and somewhat modified (124-135).    _Principal Theme_ begins in measure 135, where the preceding theme  ends; consequently, there is an Elision.  In measure 140 it is  dissolved into the    _Coda_: Section 1 (to measure 148).    Section 2 (149-160).    Section 3 (161-172).    Section 4 (173-180).    Section 5 (to end).      LESSON 15.--Analyze the following examples, as usual.  They represent  chiefly the Third Rondo-form, but _one example each_ of the First and  Second Rondo-forms have been introduced, to stimulate the vigilance of  the student.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE LARGER FORMS.--The Sonatine form is the smaller  variety of two practically kindred designs, known collectively as the  Sonata-allegro forms.  In order to obtain a clear conception of its  relation to the latter, and also to the Rondo-forms, it is necessary to  subject the entire group of so-called \"higher\" forms to a brief  comparison.    The larger, broader, or \"higher\" designs of musical composition are  divided into two classes: the three _Rondo-fo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#19)"],[1,"best clothing and such  articles of beaded ornaments as he may possess. The preceptor and  Mid[-e]/ priests are also clad in their finest apparel, each wearing one  or two beaded dancing bags at his side, secured by a band of beaded  cloth crossing the opposite shoulder. The members of the Mid[-e]/wiwin  who are not directly concerned in the preliminaries resort to the  Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n and take seats around the interior, near the wall,  where they may continue to smoke, or may occasionally drum and sing. The  drummer, with his assistants, takes a place near upon the floor of the  sacred inclosure to the left of the eastern entrance, i.e., the  southeast corner.    IMPLORATION FOR CLEAR WEATHER.    Should the day open up with a threatening sky, one of the Mid[-e]/  priests accompanying the candidate sings the following song (Pl. X B) to  dispel the clouds. Each of the lines is repeated an indefinite number of  times, and after being repeated once or twice is sung also by the others  as an accompaniment.    It will be observed that the words as spoken vary to some extent when  chanted or sung.      [Illustration]    Hi-na-n[-e]/, h[-e]/, ki/-ne-na-w[-e]/ man/-i-d[-o].

[The Mid[-e]/ communes with Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]; he is shown near the      sky; his horns denoting superior wisdom and power, while the lines      from the mouth signify speech.]    In case the appearance of the sky becomes sufficiently favorable the  initiation begins, but if it should continue to be more unfavorable or  to rain, then the song termed the \"Rain Song\" is resorted to and sung  within the inclosure of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, to which they all march in  solemn procession. Those Mid[-e]/ priests who have with them their  Mid[-e]/ drums use them as an accompaniment to the singing and to  propitiate the good will of Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]. Each line of the entire  song appears as an independent song, the intervals of rest varying in  time according to the feelings of the officiating priest.    The words of the song are known to most of the Mid[-e]/ priests; but,  as there is no method of retaining a set form of musicial notation, the  result is entirely individual and may vary with each singer, if sung  independently and out of hearing of others; so that, under ordinary  circumstances, the priest who leads off sings through one stanza of the  song, after which the others will readily catch the notes and accompany  him. It will be observed, also, that the words as spoken vary to some  extent when chanted or sung.    If this song does not appear to bring about a favorable change the  priests return to their respective wig/iwams and the crowd of visitors  disperses to return upon the first clear day.    INITIATION OF CANDIDATE.    If, however, the day be clear and promising the candidate goes early to  the sweat-lodge, where he is joined by his preceptor, and later by the  officiating priest. After all preliminaries have been arranged and the  proper time for regular proceedings has arrived, the preceptor sings the  following song (Pl. X, C), the musical notation of which varies  according to his feelings, clearly showing that there is no recognized  method of vocal delivery, as is the case with the music of dancing  songs:      [Illustration]    Kan-do/-e-a-n[-e]/,    to/-e-a-n[-e]/ kan-do/-e-a-n[-e]/,    in-nin/-n[)i] man/-e-d[-o]/-[-e]/.
