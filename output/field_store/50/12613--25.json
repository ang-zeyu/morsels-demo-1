To what use is this substance put?    The Indians make of it boots, shoes, bottles, flambeaux, and a species  of cloth. Amongst us it is combined with sulphur, forming the  vulcanized rubber of commerce, which is used for many purposes. A  greater proportion of sulphur, produces vulcanite, a hard black  substance, resembling jet.         _Flambeaux_, torches burnt to give light.      What is Sponge?    A marine substance, found adhering to rocks and shells under the  sea-water, or on the sides of rocks near the shore. Sponge was  formerly imagined by some naturalists to be a vegetable production; by  others, a mineral, or a collection of sea-mud, but it has since been  discovered to be the fabric and habitation of a species of worm, or  polypus.      What do you mean by Polypus?    A species of animals called Zoophytes, by which are meant beings  having such an admixture of the characteristics of both plants and  animals, as to render it difficult to decide to which division they  properly belong. They are animal in substance, possessed indeed of a  stomach, but without the other animal characteristics of  blood-vessels, bones, or organs of sense; these creatures live chiefly  in water, and are mostly incapable of motion: they increase by buds or  excrescences from the parent zoophyte, and if cut off will grow again  and multiply; each part becoming a perfect animal. Myriads of the  different species of zoophytes reside in small cells of coral, sponge,  &c., or in forms like plants, and multiply in such numbers as to  create rocks and whole islands in many seas, by their untiring  industry. Polypus signifies having many feet, or roots; it is derived  from the Greek.         _Myriads_, countless numbers.      Whence are the best and greatest number of Sponges brought?    From the Mediterranean, especially from Nicaria, an island near the  coast of Asia: the collection of sponges forms, in some of these  islands, the principal support of their inhabitants. They are procured  by diving under water, an exercise in which both men, women, and  children are skilled from their earliest years. The fine, small  sponges are esteemed the best, and usually come from Constantinople;  the larger and coarser sorts are brought from Tunis and Algiers, on  the coast of Africa. Sponge is very useful in the arts, as well as for  domestic purposes.      What is Coral?    A substance which, like sponge, was considered as a vegetable  production, until about the year 1720, when a French gentleman of  Marseilles commenced (and continued for thirty years,) a series of  observations, and ascertained that the coral was a living animal of  the Polypus tribe. The general name of zoophytes, or plant animals,  has since been applied to them. These animals are furnished with  minute glands, secreting a milky juice; this juice, when exuded from  the animal, becomes fixed and hard.         _Series_, a course or continued succession.         _Glands_, vessels.         _Exuded_, from exude, to flow out.      Is this substance considered by naturalists as the habitation of the  Insect?    Not merely as the habitation, but as a part of the animal itself, in  the same manner that the shell of a snail or an oyster is of those  animals, and without which they cannot long exist. By means of this  juice or secretion, the coral insects, at a vast but unknown depth  below the surface of the sea, attach themselves to the points and  ridges of rocks, which form the bottom of the ocean; upon which  foundation the little architects labor, building up, by the aid of the  above-mentioned secretion, pile upon pile of their rocky habitations,  until at length the work rises above the sea, and is continued to such  a height as to leave it almost dry, when the insects leave building on  that part, and begin afresh in another direction under the water. Huge  masses of rocky substances are thus raised by this wonderful little  insect, capable of resisting the tremendous power of the ocean when  agitated to the highest pitch by winds or tempests.         _Architect_, one who builds.      How do these Coral Rocks become Islands?    After the formation of this solid, rocky base, sea-shells, fragments  of coral, and sea-sand, thrown up by each returning tide, are broken  and mixed together by the action of the waves; these, in time, become  a sort of stone, and thus raise the surface higher and higher;  meanwhile, the ever-active surf continues to throw up the shells of  marine animals and other substances, which fill up the crevices  between the stones; the undisturbed sand on its surface offers to the  seeds of trees and plants cast upon it by the waves, a soil upon which  they rapidly grow and overshadow the dazzling whiteness of the  new-formed land. Trunks of trees, washed into the sea by the rivers  from other countries and islands, here find a resting-place, and with  these come some small animals, chiefly of the lizard and insect tribe.  Even before the trees form a wood, the sea-birds nestle among their  branches, and the stray land-bird soon takes refuge in the bushes. At  last, man arrives and builds his hut upon the fruitful soil formed by  the corruption of the vegetation, and calls himself lord and master of  this new creation.         _Surf_, the white spray or froth of the sea waves.      Where is the Coral Insect found?    In nearly all great seas; but particularly in the Mediterranean, where  it produces Corallines of the most beautiful forms and colors: it is  in the Pacific Ocean, however, where these tiny workmen are effecting  those mighty changes, which exceed the most wonderful works of man.      What is that part of the Pacific called, where the Coral Rocks are  most abundant?    The Coral Sea, from the number of coral reefs and sunken islands, with  which it abounds; it includes a region of many miles in extent, the  whole of which is studded with numberless reefs, rocks, islands, and  columns of coral, continually joining and advancing towards each  other. All navigators who have visited these seas, state that no  charts or maps are of any service after a few years, owing to the  number of fresh rocks and reefs which are continually rising to the  surface. The wonderful instinct of these animals leads them to  continue working without ceasing, until their labors are finished, or  their lives extinct.         _Reef_, a chain or line of rocks lying near the surface of       the water.         _Extinct_, at an end, dead.      What are the names of the principal islands of Coral formation?    The New Hebrides, the Friendly Isles, the Navigator's Isles, the  Society Islands, the Marquesas, the Gambier group, and others. These  groups are separated from each other by channels or seas, wider than  those which divide the individual islands which form the respective  groups; but all these waters abound with shoals and minor islets,  which point out the existence of a common base, and show that the work  by which they will afterwards be united above the level of the sea is  continually going forward.         _Shoals_, shallows; places where the water is of little       depth.         _Minor_, less, smaller than others.         _Existence_, being.      What is a singular characteristic of the Coral Islands?    On all of them a plentiful supply of sweet and fresh water may be  obtained by digging three or four feet into the coral; and even within  one yard of high-water mark such a supply is to be found. They are  mostly covered with a deep rich soil, and well wooded with trees and  evergreens of different kinds. These islands vary in extent, as well  as in the degree of finish to which they have arrived; some of the  largest being about 30 miles in diameter, and the smallest something  less than a mile;--all of various shapes, and all formed of living  coral.         _Diameter_, a straight line through the middle of a circle.      Is Coral put to any use by man?    White Coral, which is nowhere so abundant as about the shores of  Ceylon, and others of the neighboring Indian coasts, is employed as  lime by the inhabitants of that part of the world, for building  houses, &c., by burning it after the manner of our lime. This coral  lies in vast banks, which are uncovered at low water. Coral,  particularly the beautiful red sort, is likewise made into various  ornaments, as necklaces, &c.      Of what is our Lime composed?    Of a useful earth, which absorbs moisture and carbonic acid, and  exists as limestone, or in marble and chalk, which, when burnt, become  lime: in its native state it is called carbonate of lime, and is burnt  to disengage the carbonic acid; when made into a paste, with one part  water and three parts lime,[13] and mixed with some other mineral or  metallic substances, it forms plastic cements and mortars; and  afterwards, imbibing carbonic acid from the atmosphere, it becomes  again carbonate of lime, as hard as at first; and hence its use in  building.    [Footnote 13: See Chapter XVI., article Lime.]         _Plastic_, yielding, capable of being spread out or moulded.      What do you mean by Carbon?    A simple substance, whose most common form is purified charcoal: it  is, in fact, the base of charcoal, divested of all impurities;  combined with oxygen, it forms _carbonic acid_ gas, formerly called  fixed air. It is diffused through all animal and vegetable bodies; and  may be obtained by exposing them to a red heat. In its pure,  crystallized state, it constitutes the diamond, and as graphite, is  used in making the so-called lead-pencils.[14]    [Footnote 14: See Chapter XIV., article Diamond.]      What is Oxygen?    Air, mentioned in the first chapter of this work as the gaseous  substance which composes the atmosphere, is formed by a mixture of two  distinct elements, one called Nitrogen, or Azote, the other Oxygen.  Oxygen is, therefore,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#19)"],[1,"Dedicatory to Nobody.\"    The first paragraph runs:          \"MOST HONOURABLE,             \"My non-supponent Lord, and Soveraign Master of contradictions     in adjected terms, that unto you I have presumed to tender the     dedicacie of this introduction, will not seem strange to those, that     know how your concurrence did further me to the accomplishment of     that new Language, into the frontispiece whereof it is permitted.\"    After some preliminary remarks, he says:          \"Now to the end the Reader may be more enamoured of the Language,     wherein I am to publish a grammar and lexicon, I will here set down     some few qualities and advantages peculiar to itself, and which no     Language else (although all other concurred with it) is able to reach     unto.\"    There follow sixty-six \"qualities and advantages,\" which contain the  only definite information about the language, for the promised grammar  and lexicon never appeared. A few may be quoted as typical of the  inducements held out to \"pregnant and ingenious spirits,\" to the end  they \"may be more enamoured of the Language.\" The good Sir Thomas was  plainly an optimist.          \"... Sixthly, in the cases of all the declinable parts of     speech, it surpasseth all other languages whatsoever: for whilst     others have but five or six at most, it hath ten, besides the     nominative.          \"... Eighthly, every word capable of number is better provided     therewith in this language, then [_sic_] by any other: for instead of     two or three numbers which others have, this affordeth you four; to     wit, the singular, dual, plural, and redual.          \"... Tenthly, in this tongue there are eleven genders; wherein     likewise it exceedeth all other languages.          \"... Eleventhly, Verbs, Mongrels, Participles, and Hybrids     have all of them ten tenses, besides the present: which number no     language else is able to attain to.          \"... Thirteenthly, in lieu of six moods, which other languages     have at most, this one enjoyeth seven in its conjugable words.\"    Sir Thomas evidently believed in giving his clients plenty for their  money. He is lavish of \"Verbs, Mongrels, Participles, and Hybrids,\"  truly a tempting menagerie. He promises, however, a time-reduction on  learning a quantity:          \"... Seven and fiftiethly, the greatest wonder of all is that     of all the languages in the world it is easiest to learn; a boy of     ten years old being able to attain to the knowledge thereof in three     months' space; because there are in it many facilitations for the     memory, which no other language hath but itself.\"    Seventeenth-century boys of tender years must have had a good stomach  for \"Mongrels and Hybrids,\" and such-like dainties of the grammatical  _menu_; but even if they could swallow a mongrel, it is hard to believe  that they would not have strained at ten cases in three months. It might  be called \"casual labour,\" but it would certainly have been \"three  months' hard.\"    After these examples of grammatical generosity, it is not surprising to  read:          \"... Fifteenthly, in this language the Verbs and Participles     have four voices, although it was never heard that ever any other     language had above three.\"    Note that the former colleagues of the \"Verbs and Participles,\" the  \"Mongrels and Hybrids,\" are here dropped out of the category. Perhaps  it is as well, seeing the number of voices attributed to each. A  four-voiced mongrel would have gone one better than the triple-headed  hell-hound Cerberus, and created quite a special Hades of its own for  schoolboys, to say nothing of light sleepers.    Under \"five and twentiethly\" we learn that \"there is no Hexameter,  Elegiack, Saphick, Asclepiad, lambick, or any other kind of Latin or  Greek verse, but I will afford you another in this language of the same  sort\"; which leads up to:          \"... Six and twentiethly, as it trotteth easily with metrical     feet, so at the end of the career of each line, hath it dexterity,     after the manner of our English and other vernaculary tongues,     to stop with the closure of a rhyme; in the framing whereof, the     well-versed in that language shall have so little labour, that for     every word therein he shall be able to furnish at least five hundred     several monosyllables of the same termination with it.\"    A remarkable opportunity for every man to become his own poet!          \"... Four and thirtiethly, in this language also words     expressive of herbs represent unto us with what degree of cold,     moisture, heat, or dryness they are qualified, together with some     other property distinguishing them from other herbs.\"    In this crops out the idea that haunted the minds of mediaeval  speculators on the subject: that language could play a more important  part than it had hitherto done; that a word, while conveying an idea,  could at the same time in some way describe or symbolize the attributes  of the thing named. Imagine the charge of thought that could be rammed  into a phrase in such a language. Imagine too, you who remember the  cold shudder of your childhood, when you heard the elders discussing a  prospective dose--intensified by all the horrors of imagination when  the discussion was veiled in the \"decent obscurity\" of French--imagine  the grim realism of a language containing _words expressive of  herbs_,--and expressive to that extent!    There seems, indeed, to have been something rather cold-blooded about  this language:          \"... Eight and thirtiethly, in the contexture of nouns,     pronouns, and preposital articles united together, it administreth     many wonderful varieties of Laconick expressions, as in the Grammar     thereof shall more at large be made known unto you.\"    But, after all, it had a human side:          \"... Three and fourtiethly, as its interjections are more     numerous, so are they more emphatical in their respective expression     of passions, than that part of speech is in any other language     whatsoever.          \"... Eight and fourtiethly, of all languages this is the most     compendious in complement, and consequently fittest for Courtiers and     Ladies.\"    Sir Thomas seems to have been a bit of a man of the world too.          \"... Fiftiethly, no language in matter of Prayer and Ejaculations     to Almighty God is able, for conciseness of expression to compare with     it; and therefore, of all other, the most fit for the use of Churchmen     and spirits inclined to devotion.\"    This \"therefore,\" with its direct deduction from \"conciseness of  expression,\" recalls the lady patroness who chose her incumbents for  being fast over prayers. She said she could always pick out a parson who  read service daily by his time for the Sunday service.    Sir Thomas is perhaps over-sanguine to a modern taste when he concludes:          \"Besides the sixty and six advantages above all other languages,     I might have couched thrice as many more of no less consideration     than the aforesaid, but that these same will suffice to sharpen     the longing of the generous Reader after the intrinsecal and most     researched secrets of the new Grammar and Lexicon which I am to     evulge.\"                                         IV                         HISTORY OF VOLAPÜK--A WARNING    Volapük is the invention of a \"white night.\" Those who know their _Alice  in Wonderland_ will perhaps involuntarily conjure up the picture of the  kindly and fantastic White Knight, riding about on a horse covered with  mousetraps and other strange caparisons, which he introduced to all and  sundry with the unfailing remark, \"It's my own invention.\" Scoffers  will not be slow to find in Volapük and the White Knight's inventions a  common characteristic--their fantasticness. Perhaps there really is some  analogy in the fact that both inventors had to mount their hobby-horses  and ride errant through sundry lands, thrusting their creations on  an unwilling world. But the particular kind of white night of which  Volapük was born is the _nuit blanche_, literally = \"white night,\" but  idiomatically = \"night of insomnia.\"    On the night of March 31, 1879, the good Roman Catholic Bishop Schleyer,  curé of Litzelstetten, near Constance, could not get to sleep. From  his over-active brain, charged with a knowledge of more than fifty  languages, sprang the world-speech, as Athene sprang fully armed from  the brain of Zeus. At any rate, this is the legend of the origin of  Volapük.    As for the name, an Englishman will hardly appreciate the fact that  the word \"Volapük\" is derived from the two English words \"world\" and  \"speech.\" This transformation of \"world\" into _vol_ and \"speech\" into  _pük_ is a good illustration of the manner in which Volapük is based on  English, and suggests at once a criticism of that all-important point in  an artificial language, the vocabulary. It is too arbitrary.    Published in 1880, Volapük spread first in South Germany, and then in  France, where its chief apostle was M. Kerckhoffs, modern-language  master in the principal school of commerce in Paris. He founded a  society for its propagation, which soon numbered among its members  several well-known men of science and letters. The great Magasins du  Printemps--a sort of French Whiteley's, and familiar to all who have  shopped in Paris--started a class, attended by over a hundred of its  employees; and altogether fourteen different classes were opened in  Paris, and the pupils were of a good stamp.    Progress was extraordinarily rapid in other European countries, and  by 1889, only nine years after the publication of Volapük, there were  283 Volapük societies, distributed throughout Europe, America, and  the British Colonies. Instruction books were published in twenty-five  languages, including Volapük itself; numerous newspapers, in and about  Volapük, sprang up all over the world; the number"]]]
