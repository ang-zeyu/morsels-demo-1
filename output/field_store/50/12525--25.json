LISBETH                                     It stinks!  She's feeding two, whene'er she eats and drinks.    MARGARET    Ah!    LISBETH        And so, at last, it serves her rightly.  She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!  That was a promenading!  At village and dance parading!  As the first they must everywhere shine,  And he treated her always to pies and wine,  And she made a to-do with her face so fine;  So mean and shameless was her behavior,  She took all the presents the fellow gave her.  'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on!  So now, at the end, the flower is gone.    MARGARET    The poor, poor thing!    LISBETH                          Dost pity her, at that?  When one of us at spinning sat,  And mother, nights, ne'er let us out the door  She sported with her paramour.  On the door-bench, in the passage dark,  The length of the time they'd never mark.  So now her head no more she'll lift,  But do church-penance in her sinner's shift!    MARGARET    He'll surely take her for his wife.    LISBETH    He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade  Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade.  Besides, he's gone.    MARGARET                       That is not fair!    LISBETH    If him she gets, why let her beware!  The boys shall dash her wreath on the floor,  And we'll scatter chaff before her door!                                                [_Exit_.    MARGARET (_returning home_)    How scornfully I once reviled,  When some poor maiden was beguiled!  More speech than any tongue suffices  I craved, to censure others' vices.  Black as it seemed, I blackened still,  And blacker yet was in my will;  And blessed myself, and boasted high,--  And now--a living sin am I!  Yet--all that drove my heart thereto,  God! was so good, so dear, so true!

MARGARET    (_putting fresh flowers in the pots_)            Incline, O Maiden,          Thou sorrow-laden,          Thy gracious countenance upon my pain!            The sword Thy heart in,          With anguish smarting,          Thou lookest up to where Thy Son is slain!            Thou seest the Father;          Thy sad sighs gather,          And bear aloft Thy sorrow and His pain!            Ah, past guessing,          Beyond expressing,          The pangs that wring my flesh and bone!          Why this anxious heart so burneth,          Why it trembleth, why it yearneth,          Knowest Thou, and Thou alone!            Where'er I go, what sorrow,          What woe, what woe and sorrow          Within my bosom aches!          Alone, and ah! unsleeping,          I'm weeping, weeping, weeping,          The heart within me breaks.            The pots before my window,          Alas! my tears did wet,          As in the early morning          For thee these flowers I set.            Within my lonely chamber          The morning sun shone red:          I sat, in utter sorrow,          Already on my bed.            Help! rescue me from death and stain!          O Maiden!          Thou sorrow-laden,          Incline Thy countenance upon my pain!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          XIX      NIGHT    STREET BEFORE MARGARET'S DOOR    VALENTINE (_a soldier_, MARGARET'S _brother_)    When I have sat at some carouse.  Where each to each his brag allows,  And many a comrade praised to me  His pink of girls right lustily,  With brimming glass that spilled the toast,  And elbows planted as in boast:  I sat in unconcerned repose,  And heard the swagger as it rose.  And stroking then my beard, I'd say,  Smiling, the bumper in my hand:  \"Each well enough in her own way.  But is there one in all the land  Like sister Margaret, good as gold,--  One that to her can a candle hold?\"  Cling! clang! \"Here's to her!\" went around  The board: \"He speaks the truth!\" cried some;  \"In her the flower o' the sex is found!\"  And all the swaggerers were dumb.  And now!--I could tear my hair with vexation.  And dash out my brains in desperation!  With turned-up nose each scamp may face me,  With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me,  And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting,  A chance-dropped word may set me sweating!  Yet, though I thresh them all together,  I cannot call them liars, either.    But what comes sneaking, there, to view?  If I mistake not, there are two.  If _he's_ one, let me at him drive!  He shall not leave the spot alive.    FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES    FAUST    How from the window of the sacristy  Upward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer,  That, lessening side-wards, fainter grows and dimmer,  Till darkness closes from the sky!  The shadows thus within my bosom gather.    MEPHISTOPHELES    I'm like a sentimental tom-cat, rather,  That round the tall fire-ladders sweeps,  And stealthy, then, along the coping creeps:  Quite virtuous, withal, I come,  A little thievish and a little frolicsome.  I feel in every limb the presage  Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night:  Day after to-morrow brings its message,  And one keeps watch then with delight.    FAUST    Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be,  Which there, behind, I glimmering see?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Shalt soon experience the pleasure,  To lift the kettle with its treasure.  I lately gave therein a squint--  Saw splendid lion-dollars in 't.    FAUST    Not even a jewel, not a ring,  To deck therewith my darling girl?    MEPHISTOPHELES    I saw, among the rest, a thing  That seemed to be a chain of pearl.    FAUST    That's well, indeed! For painful is it  To bring no gift when her I visit.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Thou shouldst not find it so annoying,  Without return to be enjoying.  Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng,  Thou'lt hear a masterpiece, no work completer:  I'll sing her, first, a moral song,  The surer, afterwards, to cheat her.    (_Sings to the cither_.)            What dost thou here          In daybreak clear,          Kathrina dear,          Before thy lover's door?          Beware! the blade          Lets in a maid.          That out a maid          Departeth nevermore!            The coaxing shun          Of such an one!          When once 'tis done          Good-night to thee, poor thing!          Love's time is brief:          Unto no thief          Be warm and lief,          But with the wedding-ring!    VALENTINE (_comes forward_)    Whom wilt thou lure? God's-element!  Rat-catching piper, thou!--perdition!  To the Devil, first, the instrument!  To the Devil, then, the curst musician!    MEPHISTOPHELES    The cither's smashed! For nothing more 'tis fitting.    VALENTINE    There's yet a skull I must be splitting!    MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)    Sir Doctor, don't retreat, I pray!  Stand by: I'll lead, if you'll but tarry:  Out with your spit, without delay!  You've but to lunge, and I will parry.    VALENTINE    Then parry that!    MEPHISTOPHELES                     Why not? 'tis light.  VALENTINE    That, too!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Of course.    VALENTINE    I think the Devil must fight!  How is it, then? my hand's already lame:    MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)    Thrust home!    VALENTINE (_jails_)    O God!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Now is the lubber tame!  But come, away! 'Tis time for us to fly;  For there arises now a murderous cry.  With the police 'twere easy to compound it,  But here the penal court will sift and sound it.    [_Exit with_ FAUST.    MARTHA (_at the window_)    Come out! Come out!    MARGARET (_at the window_)    Quick, bring a light!    MARTHA (_as above_)    They swear and storm, they yell and fight!    PEOPLE    Here lies one dead already--see!    MARTHA (_coming from the house_)    The murderers, whither have they run?    MARGARET (_coming out_)    Who lies here?    PEOPLE    'Tis thy mother's son!    MARGARET    Almighty God! what misery!    VALENTINE    I'm dying! That is quickly said,  And quicker yet 'tis done.  Why howl, you women there? Instead,  Come here and listen, every one!    (_All gather around him_)    My Margaret, see! still young thou art,  But not the least bit shrewd or smart,  Thy business thus to slight:  So this advice I bid thee heed--  Now that thou art a whore indeed,  Why, be one then, outright!    MARGARET    My brother! God! such words to me?    VALENTINE    In this game let our Lord God be!  What's done's already done, alas!  What follows it, must come to pass.  With one begin'st thou secretly,  Then soon will others come to thee,  And when a dozen thee have known,  Thou'rt also free to all the town.  When Shame is born and first appears,  She is in secret brought to light,  And then they draw the veil of night  Over her head and ears;  Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her.  But let her growth and strength display,  She walks abroad unveiled by day,  Yet is not grown a whit the fairer.  The uglier she is to sight,  The more she seeks the day's broad light.  The time I verily can discern  When all the honest folk will turn  From thee, thou jade! and seek protection  As from a corpse that breeds infection.  Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee.  When they but look thee in the face:--  Shalt not in a golden chain array thee,  Nor at the altar take thy place!  Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing,  Make merry when the dance is going!  But in some corner, woe betide thee!  Among the beggars and cripples hide thee;  And so, though even God forgive,  On earth a damned existence live!    MARTHA    Commend your soul to God for pardon,  That you your heart with slander harden!    VALENTINE    Thou pimp most infamous, be still!  Could I thy withered body kill,  'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure,  Forgiveness in the richest measure.    MARGARET    My brother! This is Hell's own pain!    VALENTINE    I tell thee, from thy tears refrain!  When thou from honor didst depart  It stabbed me to the very heart.  Now through the slumber of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146"],[0,"A Little Princess (#19)"],[1,"called Nora) leaned forward to listen.    But Guy Clarence was not to be thwarted in his benevolence. He thrust  the sixpence into her hand.    \"Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!\" he insisted stoutly.  \"You  can buy things to eat with it.  It is a whole sixpence!\"    There was something so honest and kind in his face, and he looked so  likely to be heartbrokenly disappointed if she did not take it, that  Sara knew she must not refuse him.  To be as proud as that would be a  cruel thing.  So she actually put her pride in her pocket, though it  must be admitted her cheeks burned.    \"Thank you,\" she said.  \"You are a kind, kind little darling thing.\"  And as he scrambled joyfully into the carriage she went away, trying to  smile, though she caught her breath quickly and her eyes were shining  through a mist.  She had known that she looked odd and shabby, but  until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar.    As the Large Family's carriage drove away, the children inside it were  talking with interested excitement.    \"Oh, Donald,\" (this was Guy Clarence's name), Janet exclaimed  alarmedly, \"why did you offer that little girl your sixpence?  I'm sure  she is not a beggar!\"    \"She didn't speak like a beggar!\" cried Nora.  \"And her face didn't  really look like a beggar's face!\"    \"Besides, she didn't beg,\" said Janet.  \"I was so afraid she might be  angry with you.  You know, it makes people angry to be taken for  beggars when they are not beggars.\"    \"She wasn't angry,\" said Donald, a trifle dismayed, but still firm.  \"She laughed a little, and she said I was a kind, kind little darling  thing.  And I was!\"--stoutly.  \"It was my whole sixpence.\"    Janet and Nora exchanged glances.    \"A beggar girl would never have said that,\" decided Janet. \"She would  have said, 'Thank yer kindly, little gentleman--thank yer, sir;' and  perhaps she would have bobbed a curtsy.\"    Sara knew nothing about the fact, but from that time the Large Family  was as profoundly interested in her as she was in it.  Faces used to  appear at the nursery windows when she passed, and many discussions  concerning her were held round the fire.    \"She is a kind of servant at the seminary,\" Janet said.  \"I don't  believe she belongs to anybody.  I believe she is an orphan. But she is  not a beggar, however shabby she looks.\"    And afterward she was called by all of them,  \"The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar,\" which was, of course, rather a  long name, and sounded very funny sometimes when the youngest ones said  it in a hurry.    Sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit  of narrow ribbon round her neck.  Her affection for the Large Family  increased--as, indeed, her affection for everything she could love  increased.  She grew fonder and fonder of Becky, and she used to look  forward to the two mornings a week when she went into the schoolroom to  give the little ones their French lesson. Her small pupils loved her,  and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her  and insinuating their small hands into hers. It fed her hungry heart to  feel them nestling up to her.  She made such friends with the sparrows  that when she stood upon the table, put her head and shoulders out of  the attic window, and chirped, she heard almost immediately a flutter  of wings and answering twitters, and a little flock of dingy town birds  appeared and alighted on the slates to talk to her and make much of the  crumbs she scattered. With Melchisedec she had become so intimate that  he actually brought Mrs. Melchisedec with him sometimes, and now and  then one or two of his children.  She used to talk to him, and,  somehow, he looked quite as if he understood.    There had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about Emily, who  always sat and looked on at everything.  It arose in one of her moments  of great desolateness.  She would have liked to believe or pretend to  believe that Emily understood and sympathized with her. She did not  like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and hear  nothing.  She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to  her on the old red footstool, and stare and pretend about her until her  own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like  fear--particularly at night when everything was so still, when the only  sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of  Melchisedec's family in the wall. One of her \"pretends\" was that Emily  was a kind of good witch who could protect her.  Sometimes, after she  had stared at her until she was wrought up to the highest pitch of  fancifulness, she would ask her questions and find herself ALMOST  feeling as if she would presently answer.  But she never did.    \"As to answering, though,\" said Sara, trying to console herself, \"I  don't answer very often.  I never answer when I can help it.  When  people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to  say a word--just to look at them and THINK. Miss Minchin turns pale  with rage when I do it, Miss Amelia looks frightened, and so do the  girls.  When you will not fly into a passion people know you are  stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your  rage, and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they  hadn't said afterward.  There's nothing so strong as rage, except what  makes you hold it in--that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer  your enemies.  I scarcely ever do. Perhaps Emily is more like me than I  am like myself.  Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends, even.  She keeps it all in her heart.\"    But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, she did  not find it easy.  When, after a long, hard day, in which she had been  sent here and there, sometimes on long errands through wind and cold  and rain, she came in wet and hungry, and was sent out again because  nobody chose to remember that she was only a child, and that her slim  legs might be tired and her small body might be chilled; when she had  been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for thanks; when  the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin had been in  her worst mood, and when she had seen the girls sneering among  themselves at her shabbiness--then she was not always able to comfort  her sore, proud, desolate heart with fancies when Emily merely sat  upright in her old chair and stared.    One of these nights, when she came up to the attic cold and hungry,  with a tempest raging in her young breast, Emily's stare seemed so  vacant, her sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive, that Sara lost all  control over herself.  There was nobody but Emily--no one in the world.  And there she sat.    \"I shall die presently,\" she said at first.    Emily simply stared.    \"I can't bear this,\" said the poor child, trembling.  \"I know I shall  die.  I'm cold; I'm wet; I'm starving to death.  I've walked a thousand  miles today, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until  night.  And because I could not find that last thing the cook sent me  for, they would not give me any supper.  Some men laughed at me because  my old shoes made me slip down in the mud. I'm covered with mud now.  And they laughed.  Do you hear?\"    She looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face, and suddenly  a sort of heartbroken rage seized her.  She lifted her little savage  hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of  sobbing--Sara who never cried.    \"You are nothing but a DOLL!\" she cried.  \"Nothing but a  doll--doll--doll!  You care for nothing.  You are stuffed with sawdust.  You never had a heart.  Nothing could ever make you feel. You are a  DOLL!\" Emily lay on the floor, with her legs ignominiously doubled up  over her head, and a new flat place on the end of her nose; but she was  calm, even dignified.  Sara hid her face in her arms. The rats in the  wall began to fight and bite each other and squeak and scramble.  Melchisedec was chastising some of his family.    Sara's sobs gradually quieted themselves.  It was so unlike her to  break down that she was surprised at herself.  After a while she raised  her face and looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her round the  side of one angle, and, somehow, by this time actually with a kind of  glassy-eyed sympathy.  Sara bent and picked her up. Remorse overtook  her.  She even smiled at herself a very little smile.    \"You can't help being a doll,\" she said with a resigned sigh, \"any more  than Lavinia and Jessie can help not having any sense.  We are not all  made alike.  Perhaps you do your sawdust best.\" And she kissed her and  shook her clothes straight, and put her back upon her chair.    She had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next  door.  She wished it because of the attic window which was so near  hers.  It seemed as if it would be so nice to see it propped open  someday and a head and shoulders rising out of the square aperture.    \"If it looked a nice head,\" she thought, \"I might begin by saying,  'Good morning,' and all sorts of things might happen.  But, of course,  it's not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep  there.\"    One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the  grocer's, the butcher's, and the baker's, she saw, to her great  delight, that during her rather prolonged absence, a van full of  furniture had stopped before the next house, the front doors were  thrown open, and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying  heavy packages and pieces of furniture.    \"It's taken!\" she said.  \"It really IS taken!  Oh, I do hope a nice  head will look out of the attic window!\"    She would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had  stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in. She had an idea  that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something"]]]
