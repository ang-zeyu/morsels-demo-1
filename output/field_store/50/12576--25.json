The program of the school was arranged  with a view to the Polonization of its pupils. The language of  instruction was Polish, and the teachers of many secular subjects were  Christians. No wonder then that when the Seminary was opened in 1826,  Stern refused to accept the post of director which had been offered to  him, and yielded his place to Anton Eisenbaum, a radical assimilator.  The tendency of the school may be gauged from the fact that the  department of Hebrew and Bible was entrusted to Abraham Buchner, who had  gained notoriety by a German pamphlet entitled _Die Nicktigkeit des  Talmuds_, \"The Worthlessness of the Talmud.\" [1]    [Footnote 1: He was also the author of a Jewish catechism in Hebrew,  entitled _Yesode ha-Dat_, \"The Fundamental Principles of the Jewish  Religion.\"]    Characteristically enough, Buchner had been recommended by the ferocious  Jew-baitor Abbe Chiarini, a member of the \"Committee of Old Testament  Believers,\" which, one might almost suspect, was charged with the  supervision of Jewish education for no other reason, than that to spite  the Jews. Chiarini was professor of Oriental Languages at the University  of Warsaw. As such he considered himself an expert in Hebrew literature,  and cherished the plan of translating the Talmud into French to unveil  the secrets of Judaism before the Christian world. In 1828 Chiarini  suggested to the \"Committee of Old Testament Believers\" to arrange a  course in Hebrew Archaeology at the Warsaw University for the purpose of  acquainting Christian students with rabbinic literature and thus  equipping prospective Polish officials with a knowledge of things  Jewish. The plan having been approved by the Government, Chiarini began  to deliver a course of lectures on Judaism. The fruit of these lectures  was a French publication, issued in 1829 under the title _Theorie du  Judaisme_. It was an ignorant libel upon the Talmud and rabbinism, a  worthy counterpart of Eisenmenger's \"Judaism Exposed.\" [1] Chiarini did  not even shrink from repeating the hideous lie about the use of  Christian blood by the Jews. He was taken to task by Jacob Tugenhold in  Warsaw and by Jost and Zunz in Germany. Yet the evil seed had sunk into  the soil. Polish society, which had long harbored unfriendly sentiments  against the Jews, became more and more permeated with anti-Semitic bias,  and this bias found tangible expression during the insurrection of  1830-1831.    [Footnote 1: The book of a famous anti-Semitic writer who lived in  Germany in the seventeenth century. _Entdecktes Judentum_, the book  referred to in the text, appeared in 1700.]      4. THE JEWS AND THE POLISH INSURRECTION OF 1831    When, under the effect of the July revolution in Paris, the \"November  insurrection\" of 1830 broke out in Warsaw, it put on its mettle that  section of Polish Jewry who hoped to improve the Jewish lot by their  patriotic ardor. In the month of December one of the \"Old Testament  believers,\" Stanislav Hernish, [1] addressed himself to the Polish  dictator, Khlopitzki, in the name of a group of Jewish youths, assuring  him of their eagerness to form a special detachment of volunteers to  help in the common task of liberating their fatherland. The dictator  replied that, inasmuch as the Jews had no civil rights, they could not  be permitted to serve in the army. The Minister of War Moravski  delivered himself on this occasion of the following characteristic  utterance: \"We cannot allow that Jewish blood should mingle with the  noble blood of the Poles. What will Europe say when she learns that in  fighting for our liberty we have not been able to get along without  Jewish help?\"    [Footnote 1: Polish patriot and publicist. He subsequently fled to  France. See later, p. 109.]    The insulting refusal did not cool the ardor of the Jewish patriots.  Joseph Berkovich, the son of Berek Yoselovitch, who had laid down his  life for the Polish cause, decided to repeat his father's experiment [1]  and issued a proclamation to the Jews, calling upon them to join the  ranks of the fighters for Polish independence. The \"National Government\"  in Warsaw could not resist this patriotic pressure. It addressed itself  to the \"Congregational Board\" of Warsaw, inquiring about the attitude of  the Jewish community towards the projected formation of a separate  regiment of Jewish volunteers. The Board replied that the community had  already given proofs of its patriotism by contributing 40,000 Gulden  towards the revolutionary funds, and by collecting further contributions  towards the equipment of volunteers. The formation of a _special_ Jewish  regiment the Board did not consider advisable, inasmuch as such action  was not in keeping with the task of uniting all citizens in the defence  of the fatherland. Instead, the Board favored the distribution of the  Jewish volunteers over the whole army.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 293 et seq.]    From now on the Jews were admitted to military service, but more into  the militia than into the regular army. The commander of the National  Guard in Warsaw, Anton Ostrovski, one of the few rebel leaders who were  not swayed by the anti-Semitic prejudices of the Polish nobility,  admitted into his militia many Jewish volunteers on condition that they  shave off their beards. Owing to the religious scruples of many Jewish  soldiers, the latter condition had to be abandoned, and a special  \"bearded\" detachment of the metropolitan guard was formed, comprising  850 Jews.    The Jewish militia acquitted itself nobly of its duty in the grave task  of protecting the city of Warsaw against the onrush of the Russian  troops. The sons of wealthy families fought shoulder to shoulder with  children of the proletariat. The sight of these step-children of Poland  fighting for their fatherland stirred the heart of Ostrovski, and he  subsequently wrote: \"This spectacle could not fail to make your heart  ache. Our conscience bade us to attend to the betterment of this most  down-trodden part of our population at the earliest possible moment.\"    It is worthy of note that the wave of Polish-Jewish patriotism did not  spread beyond Warsaw. In the provincial towns the inhabitants of the  ghetto were, as a rule, unwilling to serve in the army on the ground  that the Jewish religion forbade the shedding of human blood. This  indifference aroused the ire of the Polish population, which threatened  to wreak vengeance upon the Jews, suspecting them of pro-Russian  sympathies. Ostrovski's remark with reference to this situation deserves  to be quoted: \"True,\" he said, \"the Jews of the provinces may possibly  be guilty of indifference towards the revolutionary cause, but can we  expect any other attitude from those we oppress?\" [1] It may be added  that soon afterwards the question of military service as affecting the  Jews was solved by the Diet. By the law of May 30, 1831, the Jews were  released from conscription on the payment of a tax which was four times  as large as the one paid by them in former years.    [Footnote 1: In the Western provinces outside the Kingdom of Poland, in  Lithuania, Volhynia, and Podolia, the Jewish population held itself  aloof from the insurrectionary movement. Here and there the Jews even  sympathized with the Russian Government, despite the fact that the  latter threw the Polish rulers into the shade by the extent of its  Jewish persecutions. In some places the Polish insurgents made the Jews  pay with their lives for their pro-Russian sympathies.]    When the \"aristocratic revolution,\" having failed to obtain the support  of the disinherited masses, had met with disaster, the revolutionary  leaders, who saved themselves by fleeing abroad, indulged in remorseful  reflections. The Polish historian Lelevel, who lived in Paris as a  refugee, issued in 1832 a \"Manifesto to the Israelitish Nation,\" calling  upon the Jews to forget the insults inflicted upon them by present-day  Poland for the sake of the sweet reminiscences of the Polish Republic in  days gone by and of the hopes inspired by a free Poland in days to come.  He compares the flourishing condition of the Jews in the ancient Polish  commonwealth with their present status on the same territory, under the  yoke of \"the Viennese Pharaohs,\" [1] or in the land \"dominated by the  Northern Nebuchadnezzar,\" [2] where the terror of conscription reigns  supreme, where \"little children, wrenched from the embraces of their  mothers, are hurled into the ranks of a debased soldiery,\" \"doomed to  become traitors to their religion and nation.\"    [Footnote 1: Referring to Galicia.]    [Footnote 2: Nicholas I.]      The reign of nations--exclaims Lelevel--is drawing nigh. All peoples    will be merged into one, acknowledging the one God Adonai. The rulers    have fed the Jews on false promises; the nations will grant them    liberty. Soon Poland will rise from the dust. Let then the Jews living    on her soil go hand in hand with their brother-Poles. The Jews will then    be sure to obtain their rights. Should they insist on returning to    Palestine, the Poles will assist them in realizing this consummation.    Similar utterances could be heard a little later in the mystic circle of  Tovyanski and Mitzkevitch in Paris, [1] in which the historic destiny of  the two martyr nations, the Poles and the Jews, and their universal  Messianic calling were favorite topics of discussion. But alongside of  these flights of \"imprisoned thought\" one could frequently catch in the  very same circle the sounds of the old anti-Semitic slogans. The  Parisian organ of the Polish refugees, _Nowa Polska_, \"New Poland,\"  occasionally indulged in anti-Semitic sallies, calling forth a  passionate rebuttal from Hernish, [2] an exiled journalist, who reminded  his fellow-journalists that it was mean to hunt down people who were the  \"slaves of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#19)"],[1,"agree upon a policy. Davy Crockett, who had just come, and who was  practically a stranger to Texas, gave his opinions with hesitation.    \"It's better for you, Mr. Panther, an' you, Mr. White, to make the  motions,\" he said, \"an' I an' my Tennesseans will endorse them. But it  seems, boys, that if we came for a fight it is offered to us the moment  we get here.\"    \"Yes,\" said the twelve Tennesseans all together.    \"I shall be compelled to leave you,\" said Roylston. \"Pray, don't think  it's because I'm afraid to fight the Mexicans. But, as I told you  before, I can do far greater good for the Texan cause elsewhere. As I am  now as well as ever, and I am able to take care of myself, I think I  shall leave at once.\"    \"I've known you only a few hours, Mr. Roylston,\" said Crockett, \"but  I've knocked around a hard world long enough to know a man when I see  him. If you say you ought, you ought to go.\"    \"That's so,\" said the Panther. \"We've seen Mr. Roylston tried more than  once, and nobody doubts his courage.\"    A good horse, saddled and bridled, and arms and ammunition, were given  to Roylston. Then he bade them farewell. When he was about twenty yards  away he beckoned to Ned. When the boy stood at his saddle bow he said  very earnestly:    \"If you fall again into the hands of Santa Anna, and are in danger of  your life, use my name with him. It is perhaps a more potent weapon than  you think. Do not forget.\"    \"I will not,\" said Ned, \"and I thank you very much, Mr. Roylston. But I  hope that no such occasion will arise.\"    \"So do I,\" said Roylston with emphasis. Then he rode away, a square,  strong figure, and never looked back.    \"What was he saying, Ned?\" asked Will, when the boy returned.    \"Merely promising help if we should need it, hereafter.\"    \"He looks like a man who would give it.\"    After some further talk it was decided that Ned, Will, Obed and the  Panther should ride south to watch the advance of Santa Anna, while  Crockett, Fields and the remainder should go to San Antonio and raise  such troops as they could.    \"An' if you don't mind my sayin' it to you, Mr. Crockett,\" said the  Panther, \"keep tellin' 'em over an' over again that they have need to  beware. Tell 'em that Santa Anna, with all the power of Mexico at his  back, is comin'.\"    \"Fear not, my good friend,\" said Davy Crockett. \"I shall tell them every  hour of the day. I shall never cease to bring the information before the  full quorum of the House. Again I am parliamentary, but I think you  understand, Mr. Panther.\"    \"We all understan',\" said the Panther, and then Crockett rode away at  the head of the little troop which tacitly made him commander. Ned's  eyes followed his figure as long as he was in sight. Little did he dream  of what was to pass when they should meet again, scenes that one could  never forget, though he lived a thousand years.    \"A staunch man and true,\" said Obed. \"He will be a great help to Texas.\"    Then they turned back to the cabin, the four of them, because they did  not intend to go forth until night. They missed their comrades, but the  cabin was a pleasant place, well stored now with meat of buffalo, deer  and wild turkey. Floor and walls alike were covered with dressed skins.    \"Why not fasten it up just as tightly as we can before we go away,\"  said Allen. \"The Comanches are not likely to come back, the war is  swinging another way, and maybe we'll find it here handy for us again  some day.\"    \"You're talkin' sense, Will Allen,\" said the Panther. \"It's been a  shelter to us once, and it might be a shelter to us twice. The smell of  the meat will, of course, draw wolves an' panthers, but we can fix it so  they can't get in.\"    Taking sufficient provisions for themselves, they put the rest high up  on the rafters. Then they secured the windows, and heaped logs before  the door in such a manner that the smartest wolves and panthers in the  world could not force an entrance. As they sat on their horses in the  twilight preparatory to riding away, they regarded their work with great  content.    \"There it is, waiting for us when we come again,\" said Obed White. \"It's  a pleasant thing to have a castle for refuge when your enemies are  making it too hot for you out in the open.\"    \"So it is,\" said the Panther, \"and a man finds that out more than once  in his life.\"    Then they turned their horses and rode southward in the dusk. But before  long they made an angle and turned almost due west. It was their  intention to intersect the settlements that lay between the Rio Grande  and San Antonio and give warning of the approach of Santa Anna.    They went on steadily over a rolling country, mostly bare, but with  occasional clumps of trees.          CHAPTER VII    THE HERALD OF ATTACK      About midnight they rode into the thickest part of the woods that they  could find, and slept there until day. Then they continued their course  toward the west, and before night they saw afar small bands of horsemen.    \"What do you say they are?\" asked the Panther of Ned when they beheld  the first group. \"Seems to me they are Mexican.\"    Ned looked long before returning an answer. Then he replied with  confidence:    \"Yes, they are Mexicans. The two men in the rear have lances, and no  Texan ever carried such a weapon.\"    \"Then,\" said Obed White, \"it behooves us to have a care. We're scouts  now and we're not looking for a battle. He who dodges the fight and runs  away may live to scout another day.\"    The Mexican horsemen were on their right, and the four continued their  steady course to the west. They were reassured by the fact that the  Mexicans were likely to take them in the distance for other Mexicans. It  became evident now that Santa Anna was taking every precaution. He was  sending forward scouts and skirmishers in force, and the task of the  four was likely to become one of great danger.    Toward night an uncommonly raw and cold wind began to blow. That winter  was one of great severity in Northern Mexico and Southern Texas, noted  also for its frequent Northers. Although the time for the Texan spring  was near at hand, there was little sign of it. Not knowing what else to  do they sought the shelter of timber again and remained there a while.  By and by they saw for the second time a red glow in the south, and they  knew that it came from the camp fires of Santa Anna. But it was now many  miles north of the Rio Grande. Santa Anna was advancing.    \"He's pressin' forward fast,\" said the Panther, \"an' his skirmishers are  scourin' the plain ahead of him. We've got to keep a sharp lookout,  because we may run into 'em at any time. I think we'd better agree that  if by any luck we get separated an' can't reunite, every fellow should  ride hard for San Antonio with the news.\"    The plan seemed good to all, and, after a long wait, they rode to  another clump of trees four or five hundred yards further south. Here  they saw the red glow more plainly. It could not be more than two miles  away, and they believed that to approach any nearer was to imperil their  task. Before the first light appeared the next day they would turn back  on San Antonio as the heralds of Santa Anna's advance.    The four sat on their horses among the trees, darker shadows in the  shadow. Beyond the little grove they saw the plain rolling away on every  side bare to the horizon, except in the south, where the red glow always  threatened. Ned rode to the western edge of the grove in order to get a  better view. He searched the plain carefully with his keen vision, but  he could find no sign of life there in the west.    He turned Old Jack in order to rejoin his comrades, when he suddenly  heard a low sound from the east. He listened a moment, and then, hearing  it distinctly, he knew it. It was the thud of hoofs, and the horsemen  were coming straight toward the grove, which was two or three hundred  yards in width.    Owing to the darkness and the foliage Ned could not see his comrades,  but he started toward them at once. Then came a sudden cry, the rapid  beat of hoofs, the crack of shots, and a Mexican body of cavalry dashed  into the wood directly between the boy and his comrades. He heard once  the tremendous shout of the Panther and the wild Mexican yells. Two  horsemen fired at him and a third rode at him with extended lance.    It was Old Jack that saved Ned's life. The boy was so startled that his  brain was in a paralysis for a moment. But the horse shied suddenly away  from the head of the lance, which was flashing in the moonlight. Ned  retained both his seat and his rifle. He fired at the nearest of the  Mexicans, who fell from his saddle, and then, seeing that but one  alternative was left him he gave Old Jack the rein and galloped from the  grove into the west.    Amid all the rush and terrific excitement of the moment, Ned thought of  his comrades. It was not possible for him to join them now, but they  were three together and they might escape. The Panther was a wonderful  borderer, and Obed White was not far behind him. He turned his attention  to his own escape. Two more shots were fired at him, but in both cases  the bullets went wide. Then he heard only the thud of hoofs, but the  pursuing horsemen were very near.    Something whizzed through the air and instinctively he bent forward  almost flat on the neck of Old Jack. A coiling shape struck him on the  head, slipped along his back, then along the quarters of his horse and  fell to the ground. He felt as if a deadly snake had struck at him, and  then had drawn its cold body across him. But he knew that it was a  lasso. The Mexicans would wish to take him alive, as they might secure  valuable information from him. Now he heard them shouting to one  another, every one boasting that his would be the successful throw. As  Ned's rifle was empty, and he could not reload it at such speed, they  seemed to fear nothing for themselves.    He looked"]]]
