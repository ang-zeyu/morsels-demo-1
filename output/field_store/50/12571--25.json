This is,  accordingly, what Amenemhat did. He dug a canal from the western branch  of the Nile--the modern Bahr Yousuf--leaving it at El-Lahoun, carried  his canal through the gorge, in places cutting deep into its rocky  bottom, and by a system of sluices and flood-gates retained such an  absolute control over the water that he could either admit or exclude  the inundation at his will, as it rose; and when it fell, could either  allow the water that had flowed in to return, or imprison it and keep it  back. Within the gorge he had thus at all times a copious store of the  invaluable fluid, banked up to the height of high Nile, and capable of  being applied to purposes of cultivation both within and without the  depression by the opening and shutting of the sluices.    So much appears to be certain. The exact size and position of  Amenemhat's reservoir within the depression, which a French _savant_ was  supposed to have discovered, are now called in question, and must be  admitted to be still _sub judice_. M. Linant de Bellefonds regarded the  reservoir as occupying the south-eastern or upper portion of the  depression only, as extending from north to south a distance of fourteen  miles only, and from east to west a distance varying from six to eleven  miles. He regarded it as artificially confined towards the west and  north by two long lines of embankment, which he considered that he had  traced, and gave the area of the lake as four hundred and five millions  of square metres, or about four hundred and eighty millions of square  yards. Mr. Cope Whitehouse believes that the water was freely admitted  into the whole of the depression, which it filled, with the exception of  certain parts, which stood up out of the water as islands, from one  hundred and fifty to two hundred feet high. He believes that it was in  places three hundred feet deep, and that the circuit of its shores was  from three hundred to five hundred miles. It is to be hoped that a  scientific expedition will ere long set this dispute at rest, and enable  the modern student distinctly to grasp and understand the great work of  Amenemhat. Whatever may be the truth regarding \"Lake Moeris,\" as this  great reservoir was called, it is certain that it furnished the ancients  one of the least explicable of all the many problems that the remarkable  land of the Nile presented to them. Herodotus added to the other marvels  of the place a story about two sitting statues based upon pyramids,  which stood three hundred feet above the level of the lake, and a famous  labyrinth, of which we shall soon speak.    Whether the reservoir of Amenemhat had the larger or the smaller  dimensions ascribed to it, there can be no doubt that it was a grand  construction, undertaken mainly for the benefit of his people, and  greatly conducing to their advantage. Even if the reservoir had only the  dimensions assigned to it by M. de Bellefonds, it would, according to  his calculations, have contained water sufficient, not only for  irrigating the northern and western portions of the Fayoum throughout  the year, but also for the supply of the whole western bank of the Nile  from Beni-Souef to the embouchure at Canopus for six months. This alone  would in dry seasons have been a sensible relief to a large portion of  the population. If the dimensions exceeded those of De Bellefonds, the  relief would have been proportionately greater.    The good king was not, however, content merely to benefit his people by  increasing the productiveness of Egypt and warding off the calamities  that occasionally befell the land; he further gave employment to large  numbers, which was not of a severe or oppressive kind, but promoted  their comfort and welfare. In connection with his hydraulic works in  the Fayoum he constructed a novel species of building, which after ages  admired even above the constructions of the pyramid-builders, and  regarded as the most wonderful edifice in all the world. \"I visited the  place,\" says Herodotus,[12] \"and found it to surpass description; for if  all the walls and other great works of the Greeks could be put together  in one, they would not equal, either for labour or expense, this  Labyrinth; and yet the temple of Ephesus is a building worthy of note,  and so is the temple of Samos. The pyramids likewise surpass  description, and are severally equal to a number of the greatest works  of the Greeks; but the Labyrinth surpasses the pyramids. It has twelve  courts, all of them roofed, with gates exactly opposite one another, six  looking to the north, and six to the south. A single wall surrounds the  whole building. It contains two different sorts of chambers, half of  them underground, and half above-ground, the latter built upon the  former; the whole number is three thousand, of each kind fifteen  hundred. The upper chambers I myself passed through and saw, and what I  say of them is from my own observation; of the underground chambers I  can only speak from report, for the keepers of the building could not be  induced to show them, since they contained (they said) the sepulchres of  the kings who built the Labyrinth, and also those of the sacred  crocodiles. Thus it is from hearsay only that I can speak of them; but  the upper chambers I saw with my own eyes, and found them to excel all  other human productions; for the passages through the houses, and the  varied windings of the paths across the courts, excited in me infinite  admiration, as I passed from the courts into chambers, and from the  chambers into colonnades, and from the colonnades into fresh houses, and  again from these into courts unseen before. The roof was, throughout, of  stone, like the walls; and the walls were carved all over with figures;  every court was surrounded with a colonnade, which was built of white  stones, exquisitely fitted together. At the corner of the Labyrinth  stands a pyramid, forty fathoms high, with large figures engraved upon  it, which is entered by a subterranean passage.\"    The pyramid intended is probably that examined by Perring and Lepsius,  which had a base of three hundred feet, and an elevation, probably, of  about one hundred and eighty-five feet. It was built of crude brick  mixed with a good deal of straw, and cased with a white silicious  limestone. The same material was employed for the greater part of the  so-called \"Labyrinth,\" but many of the columns were of red granite, and  some perhaps of porphyry. Most likely the edifice was intended as a  mausoleum for the sacred crocodiles, and was gradually enlarged for  their accommodation--Amenemhat, whose praenomen was found on the pyramid,  being merely the first founder. The number of the pillared courts, and  their similarity, made the edifice confusing to foreigners, and got it  the name of \"The Labyrinth\"; but it is not likely the designers of the  building had any intention to mislead or to confuse.    Amenemhat's praenomen, or throne-name, assumed (according to ordinary  custom) on his accession, was Ra-n-mat, \"Sun of Justice\" or \"Sun of  Righteousness.\" The assumption of the title indicates his desire to  leave behind him a character for justice and equity. It is perhaps  noticeable that the name by which the Greeks knew him was Moeris, which  may mean \"the beloved.\" With him closes the first period of Theban  greatness. A cloud was impending, and darker days about to follow; but  as yet Egypt enjoyed a time of progressive, and in the main peaceful,  development. Commerce, art, religion, agriculture, occupied her. She did  not covet other men's lands, nor did other men covet hers. The world  beyond her borders knew little of her, except that she was a fertile and  well-ordered land, whereto, in time of dearth, the needy of other  countries might resort with confidence.

ABRAHAM IN EGYPT.      \"Now there was a famine in the land of Canaan; and Abram went down into  Egypt to sojourn there\" (Gen. xii. 10). Few events in the history of  mankind are more interesting than the visit which the author of the  Pentateuch thus places before us in less than a dozen words. The \"father  of the faithful,\" the great apostle of Monotheism, the wanderer from the  distant \"Ur of the Chaldees,\" familiar with Babylonian greatness, and  Babylonian dissoluteness, and Babylonian despotism, having quitted his  city home and adopted the simple habits of a Syrian nomadic sheikh,  finds himself forced to make acquaintance with a second form of  civilization, a second great organized monarchy, and to become for a  time a sojourner among the people who had held for centuries the valley  of the Nile. He had obeyed the call which took him from Ur to Haran,  from Haran to Damascus, from Damascus to the hills of Canaan; he had  divorced himself from city life and city usages; he had embraced the  delights of that free, wandering existence which has at all times so  singular a charm for many, and had dwelt for we know not how many years  in different parts of Palestine, the chief of a tribe rich in flocks and  herds, moving with them from place to place as the fancy took him. It  was assuredly with much reluctance that he quitted the open downs and  fresh breezes and oak groves of Canaan the land promised to him and to  his seed after him, and took his way through the \"desert of the south\"  to the great kingdom with which he and his race could never hope to be  on terms of solid friendship.

By adding u (in case of some Consonant Stems); as,--      strepu-i,        genu-i,          alu-i.    3. By adding s (in case of most Consonant Stems); as,--      carp-o,    Perfect  carps-i.    scrib-o,      \"     scrips-i (for scrib-si).    rid-eo,       \"     ris-i (for rid-si).    sent-io,      \"     sens-i (for sent-si).    dic-o,        \"     dix-i (i.e. dic-si).      a. Note that before the ending -si a Dental Mute (t, d) is lost; a    Guttural Mute (c, g) unites with s to form x; while the Labial b is    changed to p.    4. Without addition. Of this formation there are three types:--      a) The Verb Stem is reduplicated by prefixing the initial consonant with    the following vowel or e; as,--      curro,     Perfect  cu-curri.    posco,        \"     po-posci.    pello,        \"     pe-puli.    NOTE 1.--Compounds, with the exception of do, sto, sisto, disco, posco,  omit the reduplication. Thus: com-puli, but re-poposci.    NOTE 2.--Verbs beginning with sp or st retain both consonants in the  reduplication, but drop s from the stem; as, spondeo, spo-pondi; sto,  steti.      b) The short vowel of the Verb Stem is lengthened; as, lego, legi; ago,    egi. Note that a by this process becomes e.      c) The vowel of the Verb Stem is unchanged; as, verto, verti; minuo,    minui.    Formation of the Participial Stem.    119. The Perfect Passive Participle, from which the Participial Stem is  derived by dropping -us, is formed:--    1. By adding -tus (sometimes to the Present Stem, sometimes to the Verb  Stem); as,--      ama-re,      Participle  ama-tus.    dele-re,         \"       dele-tus,    audi-re,         \"       audi-tus,    leg-ere,         \"       lec-tus,    scrib-ere,       \"       scrip-tus,    senti-re,        \"       sen-sus (for sent-tus).    caed-ere,        \"       cae-sus (for caed-tus).      a. Note that g, before t, becomes c (see Sec. 8, 5); b becomes p; while dt    or tt becomes ss, which is then often simplified to s (Sec. 8, 2).    2. After the analogy of Participles like sensus and caesus, where -sus  arises by phonetic change, -sus for -tus is added to other Verb Stems;  as,--      lab-i,       Participle  lap-sus.    fig-ere,         \"       fi-xus.      a. The same consonant changes occur in appending this ending -sus to the    stem as in the case of the Perfect ending -si (see Sec. 118, 3, a).    3. A few Verbs form the Participle in -itus; as,--      doma-re,         dom-itus.    mone-re,         mon-itus.    4.
