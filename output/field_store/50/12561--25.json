With regard also to the amount of ammunition a Zeppelin can carry, this  depends, of course, on the lifting power of the airship and the way in  which it is distributed. The later Zeppelins are said to be able to  carry a load of about 15,000 pounds, which is available for the crew,  fuel for the engines, ballast, provisions, and spare stores, a wireless  installation, and armament or ammunition. With engines of 500 horse  power, something like 360 pounds of fuel is used per hour to drive them  at full speed. Thus for a journey of twenty hours the vessel would need  at least 7200 pounds of fuel. The necessary crew would absorb 2000  pounds more, and probably another 1500 pounds would be taken up for  ballast and stores. Allowing a weight of 250 pounds for the wireless  equipment, there would remain about 4000 pounds for bombs, or something  less than two tons of explosives, for use against a target 458 miles  from the base. This amount of ammunition could be increased  proportionately as the conditions were altered by using a nearer base,  or by proceeding at a slower and therefore more economical speed, &c.    It is noteworthy that although the German airships were expected to act  as scouts in the North Sea they do not appear to have accomplished  anything in this direction. Possibly this has been due to the fear of  attack by our men-of-war or aircraft if the movements were made in  daytime, when alone they would be useful for this purpose. What happened  during the Christmas Day affair, when, as the official report said, \"a  novel combat\" ensued between the most modern cruisers on the one hand  and the enemy's aircraft and submarines on the other, would not tend to  lessen this apprehension. On the other hand, the greater stability of  the atmosphere at night makes navigation after dark easier, and I  believe that it has been usual in all countries for airships to make  their trial trips at night.    [Illustration: Radius of Action of a Modern Zeppelin    The above outline map, which we reproduce from \"The Naval Annual,\" shows  in the dotted circle the comparative radius of action of a modern  Zeppelin at half-power--about 36 knots speed--with other types of air  machines, assuming her to be based on Cologne. It is estimated that  aircraft of this type, with a displacement of about 22 tons, could run  for 60 hours at half-speed, and cover a distance equivalent to about  2160 sea miles. This would represent the double voyage, out and home,  from Cologne well to the north of the British Isles, to Petrograd, to  Athens, or to Lisbon. The inner circle shows the radius of action of a  Parseval airship at half-power--about 30 knots--based on Farnborough,  and the small inner circle represents the radius of action of a  hydro-aeroplane based on the Medway.]    It is customary also for the airships to carry, in addition to  explosive and incendiary bombs, others which on being dropped throw out  a light and thereby help to indicate to the vessel above the object  which it is desired to aim at. Probably some of the bombs which were  thrown in Norfolk were of this character. It is understood that all idea  of carrying an armament on top of the Zeppelins has now been abandoned,  and it is obvious that if searchlight equipment or guns of any sort were  carried the useful weight for bombs would have to be reduced unless the  range of action was diminished. It will have been noticed that the  Zeppelins which came on Tuesday appear to have been anxious to get back  before daylight, which looks as if they expected to be attacked if they  were seen, as it is fairly certain they would have been.    Assuming the raid of Tuesday to have been in the nature of a trial trip,  it is rather curious that it was not made before. Apparently the  Zeppelins can only trust themselves to make a raid of this description  in very favorable circumstances. Strong winds, heavy rain, or even a  damp atmosphere are all hindrances to be considered. That there will be  more raids is fairly certain, but there cannot be many nights when the  Germans can hope to have a repetition of the conditions of weather and  darkness which prevailed this week. It should be possible, more or less,  to ascertain the nights in every month in which, given other suitable  circumstances, raids are likely to be made. In view of the probability  that the attacks made by British aviators on the Zeppelin bases at  Duesseldorf and Friedrichshafen caused a delay in the German plans for  making this week's attack, it would appear that the most effective  antidote would be a repetition of such legitimate operations.          JULIUS CAESAR ON THE AISNE    [From The New Yorker Herold (Morgenblatt.)]      It has repeatedly been pointed out that 2000 years ago Julius Caesar  fought on the battlegrounds of the Aisne, which are now the location of  the fierce fighting between the Germans and the French. It is probably  less known, however, that in this present war Caesar's \"Commentarii de  Bello Gallico\" are used by French officers as a practical text book on  strategy. The war correspondent of the Corriere della Serra reports this  some what astonishing fact.    A few weeks ago he visited his friend, a commanding Colonel of a French  regiment, in his trench, which was furnished with bare necessities only.  In a corner on a small table lay the open volume of \"Commentarii  Caesaris,\" which the visitor took into his hand out of curiosity in  order to see what passage the Colonel had just been reading. There he  found the description of the fight against the Remer, who, at that time,  lived in the neighborhood of the present city of Rheims. Principally  with the aid of his Numidian troops, Caesar at that time had prevented  the Remer from crossing the River Axona, today called the Aisne.    Caesar's camp was only a few kilometers from Berry-au-Bac, in the  vicinity of Pontavert, the headquarters of the division to which the  regiment of the Colonel belonged. This Colonel had received the order to  cross the River Aisne with Moroccans and Spahis, and for this purpose he  had studied the description of Caesar. To the astonished question of the  reporter, what made him occupy his mind with the study of Caesar, the  Frenchman replied:    \"Caesar's battle descriptions form a book from which even in this  present day war a great deal may be learned. Caesar is by no means as  obsolete as you seem to think. I ask you to consider, for instance, that  the trenches which have gained so much importance in this war date back  to Julius Caesar.\"    [Illustration: H.M.

The official dispatch to Earl       Kitchener presented below records the bitter experiences of       the Winter in the trenches from the last week of November       until Feb. 2, 1915.    _The following dispatch was received on Feb. 12, 1915, from the Field  Marshal Commanding in Chief, the British Army in the Field._    _To the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W._    _General Headquarters,_    Feb. 2, 1915.    My Lord: I have the honor to forward a further report on the operations  of the army under my command.    1. In the period under review the salient feature was the presence of  his Majesty the King in the field. His Majesty arrived at Headquarters  on Nov. 30 and left on Dec. 5.    At a time when the strength and endurance of the troops had been tried  to the utmost throughout the long and arduous battle of  Ypres-Armentieres the presence of his Majesty in their midst was of the  greatest possible help and encouragement.    His Majesty visited all parts of the extensive area of operations and  held numerous inspections of the troops behind the line of trenches.    On Nov. 16 Lieutenant his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, K.G.,  Grenadier Guards, joined my staff as aide de camp.    2. Since the date of my last report the operations of the army under my  command have been subject almost entirely to the limitations of weather.    History teaches us that the course of campaigns in Europe, which have  been actively prosecuted during the months of December and January, have  been largely influenced by weather conditions. It should, however, be  thoroughly understood throughout the country that the most recent  development of armaments and the latest methods of conducting warfare  have added greatly to the difficulties and drawbacks of a vigorous  Winter campaign.    To cause anything more than a waste of ammunition long-range artillery  fire requires constant and accurate observation; but this most necessary  condition is rendered impossible of attainment in the midst of continual  fog and mist.    Again, armies have now grown accustomed to rely largely on aircraft  reconnoissance for accurate information of the enemy, but the effective  performance of this service is materially influenced by wind and  weather.    The deadly accuracy, range, and quick-firing capabilities of the modern  rifle and machine gun require that a fire-swept zone be crossed in the  shortest possible space of time by attacking troops. But if men are  detained under the enemy's fire by the difficulty of emerging from a  water-logged trench, and by the necessity of passing over ground  knee-deep in holding mud and slush, such attacks become"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#19)"],[1,"in them that is for the lasting benefit of  mankind?    For we are not in this world to amuse ourselves with its affairs. We are  here to push the whole sluggish mass forward in some particular  direction, and unless you know the direction in which you want to go  your force is of no avail. Do you love righteousness? is what each one  of us ought to ask himself. And if you love righteousness are you ready  to translate righteousness into action and be ashamed and afraid before  no man?    It seems to me, therefore, that it is worth suggesting to you that you  are not sitting here merely to transact the business and express the  ideals of a great church as represented in the State of Maryland, but  you are here also as part of the assize of humanity, to remind  yourselves of the things that are permanent and eternal, which if we do  not translate into action we have failed in the fundamental things of  our lives.    You will see that it is only in such general terms that one can speak in  the midst of a confused world, because, as I have already said, no man  has the key to this confusion. No man can see the outcome, but every man  can keep his own spirit prepared to contribute to the net result when  the outcome displays itself.          \"What the Germans Say About Their Own Methods of Warfare\"    By Joseph Bedier, Professor in the College de France    [From an article in the Revue de Paris for January, 1915.]      I purpose to show that the German armies cannot altogether escape the  reproach of violating on occasion the law of nations. I shall establish  this by French methods, through the use of documents of sound value.    My texts are genuine, well vouched for, and I have taken pains to  subject them to a critical examination, as scrupulous and minute as  heretofore in times of peace I expended in weighing the authority of  some ancient chronicle, or in scrutinizing the authenticity of some  charter. Perhaps this care was born of professional habit, or due to a  natural craving for exactness, but in either case it is a voucher for  the work, which is meant for all comers--for the passer-by, for the  indifferent, and even for my country's foes. My wish is that the veriest  looker-on, idly turning these pages, may be confronted only with  documents whose authenticity will be self-evident, if he is willing to  see, and whose ignominious tale will reach his heart, if ye have a  heart.    I have, moreover, sought for documents not only incontestably genuine  but of unquestioned authority. Accusation is easy, while proof is  difficult. No belligerent has ever been troubled to find mountains of  testimony, true or false, against his enemy; but were this evidence  gathered by the most exalted magistrates, under the most solemn judicial  sanction, it must unfortunately long remain useless; until the accused  has full opportunity to controvert it, every one is free to treat it as  false or, at the best, as controvertible. For this reason I shall avoid  resting the case upon Belgian or French statements, though I know them  to be true. My purpose has been to bring forward such testimony that no  man living, be he even a German, should be privileged to cast a doubt  upon it. German crimes will be established by German documents.    These will be taken mainly from the \"War Diaries,\" which Article 75 of  the German Army Regulations for Field Service enjoins upon soldiers to  keep during their marches, and which were seized by the French upon the  persons of their prisoners, as military papers, as authorized by Article  4 of The Hague Convention of 1907. The number of these is daily  increasing, and I trust that some day, for the edification of all, the  complete collection may be lodged in the Germanic section of manuscripts  in the National Library. Meantime, the Marquis de Dampierre,  paleographer and archivist, graduate of the Ecole des Chartes, is  preparing, and will shortly publish, a volume in which the greater part  of these notebooks will be minutely described, transcribed, and  clarified. Personally, I have only examined about forty of them, but  they will answer my purpose, by presenting relevant extracts, furnishing  the name, rank, and regiment of the author, with indications of time and  place. Classification is difficult, mainly because ten lines of a single  text not infrequently furnish evidence of a variety of offenses. I must  take them almost at random, grouping them under such analogies or  association of ideas or images as they may offer.      I.    The first notebook at hand is that of a soldier of the Prussian Guard,  the Gefreiter Paul Spielmann, (of Company I, First Brigade of the  Infantry Guard.) He tells the story of an unexpected night alarm on the  1st of September in a village near Blamont. The bugle sounds, and the  Guard, startled from sleep, begins the massacre, (Figs. 1 and 2:)    [Illustration: Figure 1.]         The inhabitants fled through the village. It was horrible. The       walls of houses are bespattered with blood and the faces of       the dead are hideous to look upon. They were buried at once,       some sixty of them. Among them many old women, old men, and       one woman pregnant--the whole a dreadful sight. Three children       huddled together--all dead. Altar and arches of the church       shattered. Telephone communication with the enemy was found       there. This morning, Sept. 2, all the survivors were driven       out; I saw four little boys carrying on two poles a cradle       with a child some five or six months old. The whole makes a       fearful sight. Blow upon blow! Thunderbolt on thunderbolt!       Everything given over to plunder. I saw a mother with her two       little ones--one of them had a great wound in the head and an       eye put out.    Deserved repression, remarks this soldier: \"They had telephone  communication with the enemy.\" And yet, we may recall that by Article  30 of The Hague Convention of 1907, signed on behalf of H.M. the Emperor  of Germany, \"no collective penalty, pecuniary or other, shall be  proclaimed against a population, by reason of individual acts for which  the population is not responsible _in solido_.\" What tribunal during  that dreadful night took the pains to establish this joint  participation?    [Illustration: Figure 2.]      II.    The unsigned notebook of a soldier of the Thirty-second Reserve Infantry  (Fourth Reserve Corps) has this entry:         Creil, Sept. 3.--The iron bridge was blown up. For this we set       the streets on fire, and shot the civilians.    Yet it must be obvious that only the regular troops of the French  Engineer Corps could have blown up the iron bridge at Creil; the  civilians had no hand in it. As an excuse for these massacres, when any  excuse is offered, the notebooks usually note that \"civilians\" or  \"francs-tireurs\" had fired on the troops. But the \"scrap of paper\" which  Germany subscribed--the Convention of 1907--provides in its first  article \"the laws, the rights, and the duties are not applicable solely  to the army, but also to militia and bodies of volunteers\" under certain  conditions, of which the main one is that they shall \"openly bear arms;\"  while Article 2 stipulates that \"the population of an unoccupied  territory, which on the approach of the enemy spontaneously takes up  arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to organize  as provided in Article I, shall be considered as a belligerent, if they  bear arms openly and observe the laws and customs of war.\"    [Illustration: Figure 3.]    In the light of this text, the bearing of the barbarous recitals which  follow may be properly estimated:         (a) Notebook of Private Hassemer, (Eighth Corps, Sept. 3,       1914, at Sommepy, Marne.)--Dreadful butchery. Village burned       to the ground; the French thrown into the burning houses,       civilians and all burned together.         (b) Notebook of Lieut. Kietzmann, (Second Company, First       Battalion, Forty-ninth Infantry,) under date of Aug. 18, 1914,       (Fig. 3.)--A short distance above Diest is the village of       Schaffen. About fifty civilians were concealed in the church       tower, and from there fired on our troops with a       _mitrailleuse_. All the civilians were shot.         [It may here be noted, for the sake of precision, that the       First Report of the Belgian Commission of Inquiry, Antwerp,       Aug. 28, Page 3, identifies some of the \"civilians\" killed at       Schaffen on the 18th of August; among them, \"the wife of       Francois Luyckz, 45 years of age, with her daughter _aged 12,       who were discovered in a sewer and shot_\"; and \"the daughter       of Jean Ooyen, 9 years of age, who was shot\"; and \"Andre       Willem, sacristain, who was bound to a tree and _burned       alive_.\"]         (c) Notebook of a Saxon officer, unnamed, (178th Regiment,       Twelfth Army Corps, First Saxon Corps,) Aug. 26.--The       exquisite village of Gue-d'Hossus (Ardennes) was given to the       flames, although to my mind it was guiltless. I am told that a       cyclist fell from his machine, and in his fall his gun was       discharged; at once the firing was begun in his direction, and       thereupon all the male inhabitants were simply thrown into the       flames. It is to be hoped that like atrocities will not be       repeated.    This Saxon officer had, nevertheless, already witnessed like  \"atrocities.\" The preceding day, Aug. 25, at Villers-en-Fagne, (Belgian  Ardennes,) \"where we found grenadiers of the guard, killed and wounded,\"  he had seen \"the cure and other inhabitants shot\"; and three days  previous, Aug. 23, at the village of Bouvignes, north of Dinant, he had  witnessed what he thus describes:         Through a breach made in the rear we get access into the       residence of a well-to-do inhabitant and occupy the house.
