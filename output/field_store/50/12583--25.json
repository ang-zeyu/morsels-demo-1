THE LEGEND OF KHNEMU AND A SEVEN YEARS' FAMINE    This Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on a large rounded block of granite,  which stands on the south-east portion of Sahal, a little island in the  First Cataract in Upper Egypt, two or three miles to the south of the  modern town of Aswan, the ancient Syene. The form of the Legend, and the  shapes of the hieroglyphs, and the late spelling of the words, prove  that the inscription is the work of the Ptolemaic Period, though it is  possible that the Legend in its simplest form is as old as the period to  which it is ascribed in the Sahal text, namely, the third dynasty, about  4100 B.C. The subject of the Legend is a terrible famine, which lasted  for seven years, in the reign of King Tcheser, and which recalls the  seven years' famine that took place in Egypt when Joseph was there. This  famine was believed to have been caused by the king's neglect to worship  properly the god Khnemu, who was supposed to control the springs of the  Nile, which were asserted by the sages to be situated between two great  rocks on the Island of Elephantine. The Legend sets forth that the  Viceroy of Nubia, in the reign of Tcheser, was a nobleman called Meter,  who was also the overseer of all the temple properties in the South. His  residence was in Abu, or Elephantine, and in the eighteenth year of his  reign the king sent him a despatch in which it was written thus: \"This  is to inform thee that misery hath laid hold upon me as I sit upon the  great throne, and I grieve for those who dwell in the Great House.[1] My  heart is grievously afflicted by reason of a very great calamity, which  is due to the fact that the waters of the Nile have not risen to their  proper height for seven years. Grain is exceedingly scarce, there are no  garden herbs and vegetables to be had at all, and everything which men  use for food hath come to an end. Every man robbeth his neighbour. The  people wish to walk about, but are unable to move. The baby waileth, the  young man shuffleth along on his feet through weakness. The hearts of  the old men are broken down with despair, their legs give way under  them, they sink down exhausted on the ground, and they lay their hands  on their bellies [in pain]. The officials are powerless and have no  counsel to give, and when the public granaries, which ought to contain  supplies, are opened, there cometh forth from them nothing but wind.  Everything is in a state of ruin. I go back in my mind to the time when  I had an adviser, to the time of the gods, to the Ibis-god [Thoth], and  to the chief Kher-heb priest Imhetep (Imouthis),[2] the son of Ptah of  his South Wall.[3] [Tell me, I pray thee], Where is the birthplace of  the Nile? What god or what goddess presideth over it? What kind of form  hath the god? For it is he that maketh my revenue, and who filleth the  granaries with grain. I wish to go to [consult] the Chief of  Het-Sekhmet,[4] whose beneficence strengtheneth all men in their works.  I wish to go into the House of Life,[5] and to take the rolls of the  books in my own hands, so that I may examine them [and find out these  things].\"    [Footnote 1: An allusion to the royal title of Pharaoh, in Egyptian  PER-AA, the \"Great House,\" in whom and by whom all the Egyptians were  supposed to live.]    [Footnote 2: A famous priest and magician of Memphis, who was  subsequently deified.]    [Footnote 3: A part of Memphis.]    [Footnote 4: _i.e._ Hermopolis, the town of Thoth.]    [Footnote 5: _i.e._ the library of the temple.]    Having read the royal despatch the Viceroy Meter set out to go to the  king, and when he came to him he proceeded to instruct the king in the  matters about which he had asked questions. The text makes the king say:  \"[Meter] gave me information about the rise of the Nile, and he told me  all that men had written concerning it; and he made clear to me all the  difficult passages [in the books], which my ancestors had consulted  hastily, and which had never before been explained to any king since the  time when Ra [reigned]. And he said to me: There is a town in the river  wherefrom the Nile maketh his appearance. 'Abu' was its name in the  beginning: it is the City of the Beginning, it is the Name of the City  of the Beginning. It reacheth to Uauatet, which is the first land [on  the south]. There is a long flight of steps there (a nilometer?), on  which Ra resteth when he determineth to prolong life to mankind. It is  called 'Netchemtchem ankh.' Here are the 'Two Qerti,'[1] which are the  two breasts wherefrom every good thing cometh. Here is the bed of the  Nile, here the Nile-god reneweth his youth, and here he sendeth out the  flood on the land. Here his waters rise to a height of twenty-eight  cubits; at Hermopolis (in the Delta) their height is seven cubits. Here  the Nile-god smiteth the ground with his sandals, and here he draweth  the bolts and throweth open the two doors through which the water  poureth forth. In this town the Nile-god dwelleth in the form of Shu,  and he keepeth the account of the products of all Egypt, in order to  give to each his due. Here are kept the cord for measuring land and the  register of the estates. Here the god liveth in a wooden house with a  door made of reeds, and branches of trees form the roof; its entrance is  to the south-east. Round about it are mountains of stone to which  quarrymen come with their tools when they want stone to build temples to  the gods, shrines for sacred animals, and pyramids for kings, or to make  statues. Here they offer sacrifices of all kinds in the sanctuary, and  here their sweet-smelling gifts are presented before the face of the god  Khnemu. In the quarries on the river bank is granite, which is called  the 'stone of Abu.' The names of its gods are: Sept (Sothis, the  dog-star), Anqet, Hep (the Nile-god), Shu, Keb, Nut, Osiris, Horus,  Isis, and Nephthys. Here are found precious stones (a list is given),  gold, silver, copper, iron, lapis-lazuli, emerald, crystal, ruby, &c.,  alabaster, mother-of-emerald, and seeds of plants that are used in  making incense. These were the things which I learned from Meter [the  Viceroy].\"    [Footnote 1: The two caverns which contained the springs of the Nile.]    Having informed the king concerning the rise of the Nile and the other  matters mentioned in his despatch, Meter made arrangements for the king  to visit the temple of Khnemu in person. This he did, and the Legend  gives us the king's own description of his visit. He says: I entered the  temple, and the keepers of the rolls untied them and showed them to me.  I was purified by the sprinkling of holy water, and I passed through the  places that were prohibited to ordinary folk, and a great offering of  cakes, ale, geese, oxen, &c., was offered up on my behalf to the gods  and goddesses of Abu. Then I found the god [Khnemu] standing in front of  me, and I propitiated him with the offerings that I made unto him, and I  made prayer and supplication before him. Then he opened his eyes,[1] and  his heart inclined to me, and in a majestic manner he said unto me: \"I  am Khnemu who fashioned thee. My two hands grasped thee and knitted  together thy body; I made thy members sound, and I gave thee thy heart.  Yet the stones have been lying under the ground for ages, and no man  hath worked them in order to build a god-house, to repair the [sacred]  buildings which are in ruins, or to make shrines for the gods of the  South and North, or to do what he ought to do for his lord, even though  I am the Lord [the Creator]. I am Nu, the self-created, the Great God,  who came into being in the beginning. [I am] Hep [the Nile-god] who  riseth at will to give health to him that worketh for me. I am the  Governor and Guide of all men, in all their periods, the Most Great, the  Father of the gods, Shu, the Great One, the Chief of the earth. The two  halves of heaven are my abode. The Nile is poured out in a stream by me,  and it goeth round about the tilled lands, and its embrace produceth  life for every one that breatheth, according to the extent of its  embrace.... I will make the Nile to rise for thee, and in no year shall  it fail, and it shall spread its water out and cover every land  satisfactorily. Plants, herbs, and trees shall bend beneath [the weight  of] their produce. The goddess Rennet (the Harvest goddess) shall be at  the head of everything, and every product shall increase a hundred  thousandfold, according to the cubit of the year.[2] The people shall be  filled, verily to their hearts' desire, yea, everyone. Want shall cease,  and the emptiness of the granaries shall come to an end. The Land of  Mera (_i.e._ Egypt) shall be one cultivated land, the districts shall  be yellow with crops of grain, and the grain shall be good. The  fertility of the land shall be according to the desire [of the  husbandman], and it shall be greater than it hath ever been before.\" At  the sound of the word \"crops\" the king awoke, and the courage that then  filled his heart was as great as his former despair had been.    [Footnote 1: The king was standing before a statue with movable eyes.]    [Footnote 2: _i.e._ the number of the cubits which the waters of the  Nile shall rise.]    Having left the chamber of the god the king made a decree by which he  endowed the temple of Khnemu with lands and gifts, and he drew up a code  of laws under which every farmer was compelled to pay certain dues to  it. Every fisherman and hunter had to pay a tithe. Of the calves cast  one tenth were to be sent to the temple to be offered up as the daily  offering. Gold, ivory, ebony, spices, precious stones, and woods were  tithed, whether their owners were Egyptians or not, but no local tribe  was to levy duty on these things on their road to Abu.

There was another loon, a mother bird, on a different lake, whose two  eggs had been carried off by a thieving muskrat; but she did not know  who did it, for Musquash knows how to roll the eggs into water and  carry them off, before eating, where the mother bird will not find the  shells. She came swimming down to meet us the moment our canoe entered  the lake; and what she seemed to cry was, \"Where are they? O where are  they?\" She followed us across the lake, accusing us of robbery, and  asking the same question over and over.    But whatever the meaning of Hukweem's crying, it seems to constitute a  large part of his existence. Indeed, it is as a cry that he is chiefly  known--the wild, unearthly cry of the wilderness night. His education  for this begins very early. Once I was exploring the grassy shores of  a wild lake when a mother loon appeared suddenly, out in the middle,  with a great splashing and crying. I paddled out to see what was the  matter. She withdrew with a great effort, apparently, as I approached,  still crying loudly and beating the water with her wings. \"Oho,\" I  said, \"you have a nest in there somewhere, and now you are trying to  get me away from it.\" This was the only time I have ever known a loon  to try that old mother bird's trick. Generally they slip off the nest  while the canoe is yet half a mile away, and swim under water a long  distance, and watch you silently from the other side of the lake.    I went back and hunted awhile for the nest among the bogs of a little  bay; then left the search to investigate a strange call that sounded  continuously farther up the shore. It came from some hidden spot in  the tall grass, an eager little whistling cry, reminding me somehow of  a nest of young fish-hawks.    As I waded cautiously among the bogs, trying to locate the sound, I  came suddenly upon the loon's nest--just the bare top of a bog, where  the mother bird had pulled up the grass and hollowed the earth enough  to keep the eggs from rolling out. They were there on the bare ground,  two very large olive eggs with dark blotches. I left them undisturbed  and went on to investigate the crying, which had stopped a moment as I  approached the nest.    Presently it began again behind me, faint at first, then louder and  more eager, till I traced it back to Hukweem's household. But there  was nothing here to account for it, only two innocent-looking eggs on  top of a bog. I bent over to examine them more closely. There, on the  sides, were two holes, and out of the holes projected the points of  two tiny bills. Inside were two little loons, crying at the top of  their lungs, \"Let me out! O let me out! It's hot in here. Let me  out--_Oooo-eee! pip-pip-pip_!\"    But I left the work of release to the mother bird, thinking she knew  more about it. Next day I went back to the place, and, after much  watching, saw two little loons stealing in and out among the bogs,  exulting in their freedom, but silent as two shadows. The mother bird  was off on the lake, fishing for their dinner.    Hukweem's fishing is always an interesting thing to watch.  Unfortunately he is so shy that one seldom gets a good opportunity.  Once I found his favorite fishing ground, and came every day to watch  him from a thicket on the shore. It was of little use to go in a  canoe. At my approach he would sink deeper and deeper in the water, as  if taking in ballast. How he does this is a mystery; for his body is  much lighter than its bulk of water. Dead or alive, it floats like a  cork; yet without any perceptible motion, by an effort of will  apparently, he sinks it out of sight. You are approaching in your  canoe, and he moves off slowly, swinging his head from side to side so  as to look at you first with one eye, then with the other. Your canoe  is swift; he sees that you are gaining, that you are already too near.  He swings on the water, and sits watching you steadily. Suddenly he  begins to sink, deeper and deeper, till his back is just awash. Go a  little nearer, and now his body disappears; only his neck and head  remain above water. Raise your hand, or make any quick motion, and he  is gone altogether. He dives like a flash, swims deep and far, and  when he comes to the surface will be well out of danger.    If you notice the direction of his bill as it enters the water, you  can tell fairly well about where he will come up again. It was  confusing at first, in chasing him, to find that he rarely came up  where he was expected. I would paddle hard in the direction he was  going, only to find him far to the right or left, or behind me, when  at last he showed himself. That was because I followed his body, not  his bill. Moving in one direction, he will turn his head and dive.  That is to mislead you, if you are following him. Follow his bill, as  he does himself, and you will be near him when he rises; for he rarely  turns under water.    With two good men to paddle, it is not difficult to tire him out.  Though he swims with extraordinary rapidity under water--fast enough  to follow and catch a trout--a long deep dive tires him, and he must  rest before another. If you are chasing him, shout and wave your hat  the moment he appears, and paddle hard the way his bill points as he  dives again. The next time he comes up you are nearer to him. Send him  down again quick, and after him. The next time he is frightened to see  the canoe so close, and dives deep, which tires him the more. So his  disappearances become shorter and more confused; you follow him more  surely because you can see him plainly now as he goes down. Suddenly  he bursts out of water beside you, scattering the spray into your  canoe. Once he came up under my paddle, and I plucked a feather from  his back before he got away.    This last appearance always scares him out of his wits, and you get  what you have been working hard for--a sight of Hukweem getting under  way. Away he goes in a smother of spray, beating the water with his  wings, kicking hard to lift himself up; and so for a hundred yards,  leaving a wake like a stern-wheel steamer, till he gathers headway  enough to rise from the water.    After that first start there is no sign of awkwardness. His short  wings rise and fall with a rapidity that tries the eye to follow, like  the rush of a coot down wind to decoys. You can hear the swift, strong  beat of them, far over your head, when he is not calling. His flight  is very rapid, very even, and often at enormous altitudes. But when he  wants to come down he always gets frightened, thinking of his short  wings, and how high he is, and how fast he is going. On the ocean, in  winter, where he has all the room he wants, he sometimes comes down in  a great incline, miles long, and plunges through and over a dozen  waves, like a dolphin, before he can stop. But where the lake is  small, and he cannot come down that way, he has a dizzy time of it.    Once, on a little lake in September, I used to watch for hours to get  a sight of the process. Twelve or fifteen loons were gathered there,  holding high carnival. They called down every migrating loon that  passed that way; their numbers increased daily. Twilight was the  favorite time for arriving. In the stillness I would hear Hukweem far  away, so high that he was only a voice. Presently I would see him  whirling over the lake in a great circle.--\"Come down, O come down,\"  cry all the loons. \"I'm afraid, _ooo-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoooo-eee_, I'm  afraid,\" says Hukweem, who is perhaps a little loon, all the way from  Labrador on his first migration, and has never come down from a height  before. \"Come on, O come _oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-hon_. It won't hurt you; we  did it; come on,\" cry all the loons.    Then Hukweem would slide lower with each circle, whirling round and  round the lake in a great spiral, yelling all the time, and all the  loons answering. When low enough, he would set his wings and plunge  like a catapult at the very midst of the assembly, which scattered  wildly, yelling like schoolboys--\"Look out! he'll break his neck;  he'll hit you; he'll break your back if he hits you.\"--So they  splashed away in a desperate fright, each one looking back over his  shoulder to see Hukweem come down, which he would do at a terrific  pace, striking the water with a mighty splash, and shooting half  across the lake in a smother of white, before he could get his legs  under him and turn around. Then all the loons would gather round him,  cackling, shrieking, laughing, with such a din as the little loon  never heard in his life before; and he would go off in the midst of  them, telling them, no doubt, what a mighty thing it was to come down  from so high and not break his neck.    A little later in the fall I saw those same loons do an astonishing  thing. For several evenings they had been keeping up an unusual racket  in a quiet bay, out of sight of my camp. I asked Simmo what he thought  they were doing.--\"O, I don' know, playin' game, I guess, jus' like  one boy. Hukweem do dat sometime, wen he not hungry,\" said Simmo,  going on with his bean-cooking. That excited my curiosity; but when I  reached the bay it was too dark to see what they were playing.    One evening, when I was fishing at the inlet, the racket was different  from any I had heard before. There would be an interval of perfect  silence, broken suddenly by wild yelling; then the ordinary loon talk  for a few minutes, and another silence, broken by a shriller outcry.  That meant that something unusual was going on, so I left the trout,  to find out about it.    When I pushed my canoe through the fringe of water-grass on the point  nearest the loons, they were scattered in a long line, twelve or  fifteen of them, extending from the head of the bay to a point nearly  opposite me. At the other end of the line two loons were swimming  about, doing"]]]
