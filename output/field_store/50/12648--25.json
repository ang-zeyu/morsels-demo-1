The only writings of Aristarchus  which now remain are his short work on the distances and magnitude of  the sun and moon, in which the error in his results arises from the want  of good observations, rather than from any mistake in his mathematical  principles.    Aratus, who was born in Cilicia, is sometimes counted among the  pleiades, or seven stars of Alexandria. His _Phenomena_ is a short  astronomical poem, without life or feeling, which scarcely aims at  any of the grace or flow of poetry. It describes the planets and the  constellations one by one, and tells us what stars are seen in the head,  feet, and other parts of each figure; and then the seasons, and the  stars seen at night at each time of the year. When maps were little  known, it must have been of great use, to learners; and its being in  verse made it the more easy to remember. The value which the  ancients set upon this poem is curiously shown by the number of Latin  translations which were made from it. Cicero in his early youth, before  he was known as an orator or philosopher, perhaps before he himself knew  in which path of letters he was soon to take the lead, translated this  poem. The next translation is by Germanicus Caesar, whose early death  and many good qualities have thrown such a bright light upon his name.  He shone as a general, as an orator, and as an author; but his Greek  comedies, his Latin orations, and his poem on Augustus are lost, while  his translation of Aratus is all that is left to prove that this high  name in literature was not given to him for his political virtues alone.  Lastly Avienus, a writer in the reign of Diocletian, or perhaps  of Theodosius, has left a rugged, unpolished translation of this  much-valued poem. Aratus, the poet of the heavens, will be read, said  Ovid, as long as the sun and moon shall shine.    Sosibius was one of the rhetoricians of the museum who lived upon the  bounty of Philadelphus. The king, wishing to laugh at his habit of  verbal criticism, once told his treasurer to refuse his salary, and say  that it had been already paid. Sosibius complained to the king, and the  book of receipts was sent for, in which Philadelphus found the names of  Soter, Sosigines, Bion, and Apollonius, and showing to the critic one  syllable of his name in each of those words, said that putting them  together, they must be taken as the receipt for his salary. Other  authors wrote on lighter matters. Apollodorus Gelous, the physician,  addressed to Philadelphus a volume of advice as to which Greek wines  were best fitted for his royal palate. The Italian and Sicilian were  then unknown in Egypt, and those of the Thebaid were wholly beneath  his notice, while the vine had as yet hardly been planted in the  neighbourhood of Alexandria. He particularly praised the Naspercenite  wine from the southern banks of the Black Sea, the Oretic from the  island of Euboea; the OEneatic from Locris; the Leuca-dian from the  island of Leucas; and the Ambraciote from the kingdom of Epirus.    [Illustration: 128.jpg AN ATHLETE DISPORTING ON A CROCODILE]    But above all these he placed the Peparethian wine from the island of  Peparethus, a wine which of course did not please the many, as this  experienced taster acknowledges that nobody is likely to have a true  relish for it till after six years' acquaintance. Such were the Greek  authors who basked in the sunshine of royal favour at Alexandria; who  could have told us, if they had thought it worth their while, all that  we now wish to know of the trade, religion, language, and early history  of Egypt. But they thought that the barbarians were not worth the  notice of men who called themselves Macedonians. Philadelphus, however,  thought otherwise; and by his command Manetho, an Egyptian, wrote in  Greek a history of Egypt, copied from the hieroglyphical writing on  the temples, and he dedicated it to the king. We know it only in the  quotations of Josephus and Julius Africanus, and what we have is little  more than a list of kings' names. He was a priest of Heliopolis, the  great seat of Egyptian learning. The general correctness of Manetho's  history, which runs back for nearly two thousand years, is shown by our  finding the kings' names agree with many Egyptian inscriptions. Manetho  owes his reputation to the merit of being the first who distinguished  himself as a writer and critic upon religion and philosophy, as well  as chronology and history, using the Greek language, but drawing his  materials from native sources, especially the Sacred Books. That he was  \"skilled in Greek letters\": we learn from Josephus, who also declares  that he contradicted many of Herodotus' erroneous statements. Manetho  was better suited for the task of writing a history of Egypt than any of  his contemporaries.    As an Egyptian he could search out and make use of all the native  Egyptian sources, and, thanks to his knowledge of Greek, he could  present them in a form intelligible to the Hellenes. It must be  confessed that he has occasionally fallen into the error of allowing  Greek thoughts and traditions to slip into his work. The great worth  in Manetho's work lies in the fact that he relates the history of Egypt  based on monumental sources and charters preserved in the temples.  Moreover, he treats quite impartially the times of the foreign rulers,  which the form of the Egyptian history employed by Diodorus does not  mention; but above all, Manetho gives us a list of Egyptian rulers  arranged according to a regular system. But however important in  this respect Manetho's work may be, it must not be forgotten what  difficulties he had to contend with in the writing of it, and what  unreliable sources lay in these difficulties. He could not use the  sources in the form in which he found them. He was obliged to re-write  them, and he added to them synchronisms and relations to other peoples  which necessarily exposed him to the dangers of colouring his report  correspondingly.    But a much greater difficulty consisted in the fact that the  chronological reports of the earlier history were all arranged according  to the reigning years of the rulers, so that Manetho was obliged to  construct an era for his work. Boeckh was the first to discover  with certainty the existence and form of this era. According to his  researches, the whole work of Manetho is based upon Sothicycles of 1460  Julianic years. The Egyptian year was movable, and did not need the  extra day every few years, but the consequence was that every year  remained a quarter of a day behind the real year.    [Illustration: 131.jpg MODERN SPHINX-LIKE FACE]    When 1460-1 years had elapsed this chronological error had mounted to  a whole year, and so the movable year and the fixed year fell together  again. It is this Sothic period which Manetho has employed in his  account of Egyptian history. Besides his history, Manetho has left us a  work on astrology, called _Apotelesmatica_, or Events, a work of which  there seems no reason to doubt the genuineness.    It is a poem in hexameter verse, in good Greek, addressed to King  Ptolemy, in which he calls, not only upon Apollo and the Muse, but, like  a true Egyptian, upon Hermes, from whose darkly worded writings he had  gained his knowledge. He says that the king's greatness might have been  foretold from the places of Mars and the Sun at the time of his birth,  and that his marriage with his sister Arsinoe arose from the places of  Venus and Saturn at the same time. But while we smile at this being said  as the result of astronomical calculations, we must remember that for  centuries afterwards, almost in our own time, the science of judicial  astrology was made a branch of astronomy, and that the fault lay rather  in the age than in the man; and we have the pain of thinking that,  while many of the valuable writings by Manetho are lost, the copiers and  readers of manuscripts have carefully saved for us this nearly worthless  poem on astrology.    Petosiris was another writer on astrology and astronomy who was highly  praised by his friend Manetho; and his calculations on the distances  of the sun and planets are quoted by Pliny. His works are lost; but his  name calls for our notice, as he must have been a native Egyptian, and  a priest. Like Manetho, he also wrote on the calculation of nativities;  and the later Greek astrologers, when what they had foretold did not  come to pass, were wont to lay the blame on Petosiris. The priests were  believed to possess these and other supernatural powers; and to help  their claims to be believed many of them practised ventriloquism.    Timosthenes, the admiral under Philadelphus, must not be forgotten in  this list of authors; for though his verses to Apollo were little worth  notice, his voyages of discovery, and his work in ten books on harbours,  placed him in the first rank among geographers. Colotes, a pupil and  follower of Epicurus, dedicated to Philadelphus a work of which the very  title proves the nature of his philosophy, and how soon the rules of his  master had fitted themselves to the habits of the sensualist. Its  title was \"That it is impossible even to support life according to the  philosophical rules of any but the Epicureans.\" It was a good deal read  and talked about; and three hundred years afterwards Plutarch thought it  not a waste of time to write against it at some length.    At a time when books were few, and far too dear to be within reach of  the many, and indeed when the number of those who could read must have  been small, other means were of course taken to meet the thirst after  knowledge; and the chief of these were the public readings in the  theatre. This was not overlooked by Phila-delphus, who employed  Hegesias to read Herodotus, and Hermophantus to read Homer, the earliest  historian and the earliest poet, the two authors who had taken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#19)"],[1,"name from this city. The  sculptures on the beautiful temples of Contra-Latopolis were also  finished in this reign, and the emperor's names and titles were carved  on the walls in hieroglyphics, with those of the Ptolemies, under whom  the temple itself had been built. Commodus may perhaps not have been  the last emperor whose name and praises were carved in hieroglyphics;  but all the great buildings in the Thebaid, which add such value to the  early history of Egypt, had ceased before his reign. Other buildings of  a less lasting form were no doubt being built, such as the Greek temples  at Antinoopolis and Ptolemais, which have long since been swept away;  but the Egyptian priests, with their gigantic undertakings, their noble  plan of working for after ages rather than for themselves, were nearly  ruined, and we find no ancient building now standing in Egypt that was  raised after the time of the dynasty of the Antonines.    [Illustration: 128.jpg CANOPIC JARS]    But the poverty of the Egyptians was not the only cause why they built  no more temples. Though the colossal statue of Amenhothes uttered  its musical notes every morning at sunrise, still tuneful amid the  desolation with which it was surrounded, and the Nile was still  worshipped at midsummer by the husbandman to secure its fertilising  overflow; nevertheless, the religion itself for which the temples had  been built was fast giving way before the silent spread of Christianity.  The religion of the Egyptians, unlike that of the Greeks, was no  longer upheld by the magistrate; it rested solely on the belief of its  followers, and it may have merged into Christianity the faster for the  greater number of truths which were contained in it than in the paganism  of other nations. The scanty hieroglyphical records tell us little  of thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Indeed that cumbersome mode of  writing, which alone was used in religious matters, was little fitted  for anything beyond the most material parts of their mythology. Hence  we must not believe that the Egyptian polytheism was quite so gross as  would appear from the sculptures; and indeed we there learn that they  believed, even at the earliest times, in a resurrection from the tomb, a  day of judgment, and a future state of rewards and punishments.    The priests made a great boast of their learning and philosophy, and  could each repeat by heart those books of Thot which belonged to his own  order. The singer, who walked first in the sacred processions, bearing  the symbols of music, could repeat the books of hymns and the rules for  the king's life. The soothsayer, who followed, carrying a clock and a  palm-branch, the emblem of the year, could repeat the four astrological  books; one on the moon's phases, one on the fixed stars, and two on  their heliacal risings. The scribe, who walked next, carrying a book  and the flat rule which held the ink and pen, was acquainted with the  geography of the world and of the Nile, and with those books which  describe the motions of the sun, moon, and planets, and the furniture  of the temple and consecrated places. The master of the robes understood  the ten books relating to education, to the marks on the sacred  heifers, and to the worship of the gods, embracing the sacrifices, the  first-fruits, the hymns, the prayers, the processions, and festivals.  The prophet or preacher, who walked last, carrying in his arms the  great water-pot, was the president of the temple, and learned in the ten  books, called hieratic, relating to the laws, the gods, the management  of the temples, and the revenue. Thus, of the forty-two chief books of  Thot, thirty-six were learned by these priests, while the remaining  six on the body, its diseases, and medicines, were learned by the  Pastophori, priests who carried the image of the god in a small shrine.  These books had been written at various times: some may have been very  old, but some were undoubtedly new; they together formed the Egyptian  bible. Apollonius, or Apollonides Horapis, an Egyptian priest, had  lately published a work on these matters in his own language, named  Shomenuthi, _the book of the gods_.    [Illustration: 130.jpg RELIGIOUS PROCESSION]    But the priests were no longer the earnest, sincere teachers as of  old; they had invented a system of secondary meanings, by which they  explained away the coarse religion of their statues and sacred animals.    They had two religions, one for the many and one for the few; one,  material and visible, for the crowds in the outer courtyards, in which  the hero was made a god and every attribute of deity was made a person;  and another, spiritual and intellectual, for the learned in the schools  and sacred colleges. Even if we were not told, we could have no doubt  but the main point of secret knowledge among the learned was a disbelief  in those very doctrines which they were teaching to the vulgar, and  which they now explained among themselves by saying that they had a  second meaning. This, perhaps, was part of the great secret of the  goddess Isis, the secret of Abydos, the betrayer of which was more  guilty than he who should try to stop the _baris_ or sacred barge in the  procession on the Nile. The worship of gods, before whose statues the  nation had bowed with unchanging devotion for at least two thousand  years was now drawing to a close. Hitherto the priests had been able to  resist all new opinions.    [Illustration: 131.jpg SHRINE]    The name of Amon-Ra had at one time been cut out from the Theban  monuments to make way for a god from Lower Egypt; but it had been cut in  again when the storm passed by. The Jewish monotheism had left the  crowd of gods unlessened. The Persian efforts had overthrown statues and  broken open temples, but had not been able to introduce their worship of  the sun. The Greek conquerors had yielded to the Egyptian mind without  a struggle; and Alexander had humbly begged at the door of the temple  to be acknowledged as a son of Amon. But in the fulness of time  these opinions, which seemed as firmly based as the monuments which  represented them, sunk before a religion which set up no new statues,  and could command no force to break open temples.    The Egyptian priests, who had been proud of the superiority of their own  doctrines over the paganism of their neighbours, mourned the overthrow  of their national religion. \"Our land,\" says the author of Hermes  Trismegistus, \"is the temple of the world; but, as wise men should  foresee all things, you should know that a time is coming when it will  seem that the Egyptians have by an unfailing piety served God in  vain. For when strangers shall possess this kingdom religion will  be neglected, and laws made against piety and divine worship, with  punishment on those who favour it. Then this holy seat will be full of  idolatry, idols' temples, and dead men's tombs. O Egypt, Egypt, there  shall remain of thy religion but vague stories which posterity will  refuse to believe, and words graven in stone recounting thy piety. The  Scythian, the Indian, or some other barbarous neighbour shall dwell in  Egypt. The Divinity shall reascend into the heaven; and Egypt shall be a  desert, widowed of men and gods.\"    The spread of Christianity among the Egyptians was such that their  teachers found it necessary to supply them with a life of Jesus, written  in their own language, that they might the more readily explain to  them his claim to be obeyed, and the nature of his commands. The Gospel  according to the Egyptians, for such was the name this work bore, has  long since been lost, and was little quoted by the Alexandrians. It was  most likely a translation from one of the four gospels, though it had  some different readings suited to its own church, and contained some  praise of celibacy not found in the New Testament; but it was not valued  by the Greeks, and was lost on the spread of the Koptic translation of  the whole New Testament.    The grave, serious Christians of Upper Egypt were very unlike the lively  Alexandrians. But though the difference arose from peculiarities of  national character, it was only spoken of as a difference of opinion.  The Egyptians formed an ascetic sect in the church, who were called  heretics by the Alexandrians, and named Docetas, because they taught  that the Saviour was a god, and did not really suffer on the cross, but  was crucified only _in appearance_. They of necessity used the Gospel  according to the Egyptians, which is quoted by Cassianus, one of their  writers; many of them renounced marriage with, the other pleasures  and duties of social life, and placed their chief virtue in painful  self-denial; and out of them sprang that remarkable class of hermits,  monks, and fathers of the desert who in a few centuries covered Europe  with monasteries.    It is remarkable that the translation of a gospel into Koptic introduced  a Greek alphabet into the Koptic language. Though for all religious  purposes the scribes continued to use the ancient hieroglyphics, in  which we trace the first steps by which pictures are made to represent  words and syllables rather than letters, yet for the common purposes of  writing they had long since made use of the _enchorial_ or common hand,  in which the earlier system of writing is improved by the characters  representing only letters, though sadly too numerous for each to have a  fixed and well-known force. But, as the hieroglyphics were also always  used for carved writing on all subjects, and the common hand only used  on papyrus with a reed pen, the latter became wholly an indistinct  running hand; it lost that beauty and regularity which the  hieroglyphics, like the Greek and Roman characters, kept by being carved  on stone, and hence it would seem arose the want of a new alphabet for  the New Testament. This was made by merely adding to the Greek alphabet  six new letters borrowed from the "]]]
