[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16623"],[0,"Letters of a Woman Homesteader (#19)"],[1,"there were a number of deserted cabins in which we  could make ourselves comfortable. So it was planned that we go up the  next morning, stay all night, have the hunt the following morning, and  then come home with our game.    Well, we were all astir early the next morning and soon grain, bedding,  and chuck-box were in the wagon. Then Mrs. Louderer, the _kinder_, and  myself piled in; Mrs. O'Shaughnessy bestrode Chief, Gavotte stalked on  ahead to pick our way, and we were off.    It was a long, tedious climb, and I wished over and over that I had  stayed at home; but it was altogether on Baby's account. I was so  afraid that he would suffer, but he kept warm as toast. The day was  beautiful, and the views many times repaid us for any hardship we had  suffered. It was three o'clock before we reached the old mill camp.  Soon we had a roaring fire, and Gavotte made the horses comfortable in  one of the cabins. They were bedded in soft, dry sawdust, and were  quite as well off as if they had been in their own stalls. Then some  rough planks were laid on blocks, and we had our first meal since  breakfast. We called it supper, and we had potatoes roasted in the  embers, Mrs. Louderer's _wurst_, which she had been calmly carrying  around on her arm like a hoop and which was delicious with the bread  that Gavotte toasted on long sticks; we had steaming coffee, and we  were all happy; even Baby clapped his hands and crowed at the unusual  sight of an open fire. After supper Gavotte took a little stroll and  returned with a couple of grouse for our breakfast. After dark we sat  around the fire eating peanuts and listening to Gavotte and Mrs.  Louderer telling stories of their different great forests. But soon  Gavotte took his big sleeping-bag and retired to another cabin, warning  us that we must be up early. Our improvised beds were the most  comfortable things; I love the flicker of an open fire, the smell of  the pines, the pure, sweet air, and I went to sleep thinking how blest  I was to be able to enjoy the things I love most.    It seemed only a short time until some one knocked on our door and we  were all wide awake in a minute. The fire had burned down and only a  soft, indistinct glow from the embers lighted the room, while through a  hole in the roof I could see a star glimmering frostily. It was Gavotte  at the door and he called through a crack saying he had been hearing  queer noises for an hour and he was going to investigate. He had called  us so that we need not be alarmed should we hear the noise and not find  him. We scrambled into our clothes quickly and ran outdoors to listen.    I can never describe to you the weird beauty of a moonlight night among  the pines when the snow is sparkling and gleaming, the deep silence  unbroken even by the snapping of a twig. We stood shivering and  straining our ears and were about to go back to bed when we heard  faintly a long-drawn wail as if all the suffering and sorrow on earth  were bound up in that one sound. We couldn't tell which way it came  from; it seemed to vibrate through the air and chill our hearts. I had  heard that panthers cried that way, but Gavotte said it was not a  panther. He said the engine and saws had been moved from where we were  to another spring across the canon a mile away, where timber for sawing  was more plentiful, but he supposed every one had left the mill when  the water froze so they couldn't saw. He added that some one must have  remained and was, perhaps, in need of help, and if we were not afraid  he would leave us and go see what was wrong.    We went in, made up the fire, and sat in silence, wondering what we  should see or hear next. Once or twice that agonized cry came shivering  through the cold moonlight. After an age, we heard Gavotte crunching  through the snow, whistling cheerily to reassure us. He had crossed the  canon to the new mill camp, where he had found two women, loggers'  wives, and some children. One of the women, he said, was \"so ver'  seek,\" 't was she who was wailing so, and it was the kind of \"seek\"  where we could be of every help and comfort.    Mrs. Louderer stayed and took care of the children while Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy and I followed after Gavotte, panting and stumbling,  through the snow. Gavotte said he suspected they were short of  \"needfuls,\" so he had filled his pockets with coffee and sugar, took in  a bottle some of the milk I brought for Baby, and his own flask of  whiskey, without which he never travels.    At last, after what seemed to me hours of scrambling through the snow,  through deepest gloom where pines were thickest, and out again into  patches of white moonlight, we reached the ugly clearing where the new  camp stood. Gavotte escorted us to the door and then returned to our  camp. Entering, we saw the poor, little soon-to-be mother huddled on  her poor bed, while an older woman stood near warning her that the oil  would soon be all gone and they would be in darkness. She told us that  the sick one had been in pain all the day before and much of the night,  and that she herself was worn completely out. So Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  sent her to bed and we took charge.    Secretly, I felt it all to be a big nuisance to be dragged out from my  warm, comfortable bed to traipse through the snow at that time of the  night. But the moment poor little Molly spoke I was glad I was living,  because she was a poor little Southern girl whose husband is a Mormon.  He had been sent on a mission to Alabama, and the poor girl had fallen  in love with his handsome face and knew nothing of Mormonism, so she  had run away with him. She thought it would be so grand to live in the  glorious West with so splendid a man as she believed her husband to  be. But now she believed she was going to die and she was glad of it  because she could not return to her \"folks,\" and she said she knew her  husband was dead because he and the other woman's husband, both of whom  had intended to stay there all winter and cut logs, had gone two weeks  before to get their summer's wages and buy supplies. Neither man had  come back and there was not a horse or any other way to get out of the  mountains to hunt them, so they believed the men to be frozen somewhere  on the road. Rather a dismal prospect, wasn't it? Molly was just  longing for some little familiar thing, so I was glad I have not yet  gotten rid of my Southern way of talking. No Westerner can ever  understand a Southerner's need of sympathy, and, however kind their  hearts, they are unable to give it. Only a Southerner can understand  how dear are our peculiar words and phrases, and poor little Molly took  new courage when she found I knew what she meant when she said she was  just \"honin'\" after a friendly voice.    Well, soon we had the water hot and had filled some bottles and placed  them around our patient, and after a couple of hours the tiny little  stranger came into the world. It had been necessary to have a great  fire in order to have light, so as soon as we got Baby dressed I opened  the door a little to cool the room and Molly saw the morning star  twinkling merrily. \"Oh,\" she said, \"that is what I will call my little  girlie,--Star, dear little Star.\"    It is strange, isn't it? how our spirits will revive after some great  ordeal. Molly had been sure she was going to die and saw nothing to  live for; now that she had had a cup of hot milk and held her red  little baby close, she was just as happy and hopeful as if she had  never left her best friends and home to follow the uncertain fortunes  of young Will Crosby. So she and I talked of ash-hoppers, smoke-houses,  cotton-patches, goobers, poke-greens, and shoats, until she fell  asleep.    Soon day was abroad, and so we went outdoors for a fresh breath. The  other woman came out just then to ask after Molly. She invited us into  her cabin, and, oh, the little Mormons were everywhere; poor, half-clad  little things! Some sour-dough biscuit and a can of condensed milk was  everything they had to eat. The mother explained to us that their \"men\"  had gone to get things for them, but had not come back, so she guessed  they had got drunk and were likely in jail. She told it in a very  unconcerned manner. Poor thing! Years of such experience had taught her  that blessed are they who expect nothing, for they shall not be  disappointed. She said that if Molly had not been sick she would have  walked down out of the mountains and got help.    Just then two shots rang out in quick succession, and soon Gavotte came  staggering along with a deer across his shoulders. That he left for  the family. From our camp he had brought some bacon and butter for  Molly, and, poor though it may seem, it was a treat for her. Leaving  the woman to dress the venison with her oldest boy's aid, we put out  across the canon for our own breakfast. Beside our much-beaten trail  hung the second venison, and when we reached our camp and had our own  delicious breakfast of grouse, bread, butter, and coffee, Gavotte took  Chub and went for our venison. In a short time we were rolling  homeward. Of course it didn't take us nearly so long to get home  because it was downhill and the road was clearly marked, so in a couple  of hours we were home.    Gavotte knew the two loggers were in Green River and were then at work  storing ice for the railroad, but he had not known that their wives  were left as they were. The men actually had got drunk, lost their  money, and were then trying to replace it. After we debated a bit we  decided we could not enjoy Christmas with those people in want up  there in the cold. Then we got busy. It is sixty miles to town,  although our nearest point to the railroad is but forty, so you see it  was impossible to get to town to get anything. You should have seen us!  Every old garment that had ever been left by men who have worked here  was hauled out, and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy's deft fingers soon had a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#19)"],[1," any match for him. I cannot choose but  rely on my own poverty, more than on your wealth. I cannot make your  consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet  has a faint, moon-like ray. I hear what you say of the admirable parts  and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see well that for all  his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is at least a poor  Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast shadow of the  Phenomenal includes thee, also, in its pied and painted  immensity,--thee, also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou  art not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is,--thou art not my soul, but  a picture and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already  thou art seizing thy hat and cloak. It is not that the soul puts forth  friends, as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the  germination of new buds, extrudes the old leaf?[293] The law of nature  is alternation forevermore. Each electrical state superinduces the  opposite. The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter  into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone, for a  season, that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method  betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations. The  instinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and  the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase. Thus  every man passes his life in the search after friendship, and if he  should record his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this,  to each new candidate for his love:--         DEAR FRIEND:--         If I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match       my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles,       in relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise;       my moods are quite attainable; and I respect thy genius; it       is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not presume in thee a       perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a       delicious torment. Thine ever, or never.    8. Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity, and  not for life. They are not to be indulged. This is to weave cobweb,  and not cloth. Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions,  because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams,[294] instead  of the tough fiber of the human heart. The laws of friendship are  great, austere, and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature and of  morals. But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a  sudden sweetness. We snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden  of God, which many summers and many winters must ripen. We seek our  friend not sacredly but with an adulterate passion which would  appropriate him to ourselves. In vain. We are armed all over with  subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet, begin to play, and  translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost all people descend to  meet. All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the  very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures  disappears as they approach each other. What a perpetual  disappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and gifted!  After interviews have been compassed with long foresight, we must be  tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden, unseasonable  apathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the heyday of  friendship and thought. Our faculties do not play us true, and both  parties are relieved by solitude.    9. I ought to be equal to every relation. It makes no difference how  many friends I have, and what content I can find in conversing with  each, if there be one to whom I am not equal. If I have shrunk unequal  from one contest instantly, the joy I find in all the rest becomes  mean and cowardly. I should hate myself, if then I made my other  friends my asylum.        \"The valiant warrior[295] famoused for fight,         After a hundred victories, once foiled,       Is from the book of honor razed quite,         And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.\"    10. Our impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and apathy are  a tough husk in which a delicate organization is protected from  premature ripening. It would be lost if it knew itself before any of  the best souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it. Respect the  _naturlangsamkeit_[296] which hardens the ruby in a million years,  and works in duration, in which Alps and Andes come and go as  rainbows. The good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price  of rashness. Love, which is the essence of God, is not for levity, but  for the total worth of man. Let us not have this childish luxury in  our regards, but the austerest worth; let us approach our friend with  an audacious trust in the truth of his heart, in the breadth,  impossible to be overturned, of his foundations.    11. The attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I  leave, for the time, all account of subordinate social benefit, to  speak of that select and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute,  and which even leaves the language of love suspicious and common, so  much is this purer, and nothing is so much divine.    12. I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest  courage. When they are real, they are not glass threads or frost-work,  but the solidest thing we know. For now, after so many ages of  experience, what do we know of nature, or of ourselves? Not one step  has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his destiny. In  one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men. But the  sweet sincerity of joy and peace, which I draw from this alliance  with my brother's soul, is the nut itself whereof all nature and all  thought is but the husk and shell. Happy is the house that shelters a  friend! It might well be built, like a festal bower or arch, to  entertain him a single day. Happier, if he know the solemnity of that  relation, and honor its law! He who offers himself a candidate for  that covenant comes up, like an Olympian,[297] to the great games,  where the first-born of the world are the competitors. He proposes  himself for contest where Time, Want, Danger are in the lists, and he  alone is victor who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve  the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these. The  gifts of fortune may be present or absent, but all the hap in that  contest depends on intrinsic nobleness, and the contempt of trifles.  There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship, each  so sovereign, that I can detect no superiority in either, no reason  why either should be first named. One is Truth. A friend is a person  with whom I may be sincere. Before him, I may think aloud. I am  arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that I may  drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and  second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with  the simplicity and wholeness, with which one chemical atom meets  another. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, but diadems and authority,  only to the highest rank, _that_ being permitted to speak truth as  having none above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone is  sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins. We  parry and fend the approach of our fellow-man by compliments, by  gossip, by amusements, by affairs. We cover up our thought from him  under a hundred folds. I knew a man who,[298] under a certain  religious frenzy, cast off this drapery, and omitting all compliments  and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he  encountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At first he was  resisted, and all men agreed he was mad. But persisting, as indeed he  could not help doing, for some time in this course, he attained to the  advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true  relations with him. No man would think of speaking falsely with him,  or of putting him off with any chat of markets or reading-rooms. But  every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like plain  dealing and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth he  had, he did certainly show him. But to most of us society shows not  its face and eye, but its side and its back. To stand in true  relations with men in a false age, is worth a fit of insanity, is it  not? We can seldom go erect. Almost every man we meet requires some  civility,--requires to be humored; he has some fame, some talent, some  whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be  questioned, and which spoils all conversation with him. But a friend  is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me. My friend gives  me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part. A  friend, therefore, is a sort of paradox[299] in nature. I who alone  am, I who see nothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with  equal evidence to my own, behold now the semblance of my being in all  its height, variety and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so  that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.    13. The other element of friendship is tenderness. We are holden to  men by every sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by  lucre, by lust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and  badge and trifle, but we can scarce believe that so much character can  subsist in another as to draw us by love. Can another be so blessed,  and we so pure, that we can offer him tenderness? When a man becomes  dear to me, I have touched the goal of fortune. I find very little  written directly to the heart of this matter in books. And yet I have  one text which I cannot choose but remember. My author says,[300]--\"I  offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I effectually am, and  tender myself least to him to whom I am the most devoted.\" I wish that  friendship should have feet, as"]]]
