Slim was getting fatter every year, and his horses always  puffed when they climbed a hill under his weight. His round eyes glared  resentfully at the man and the shack and at the three who were sitting  there so quietly on their horses--just as if they had ridden up for a  friendly call. \"Ain't this shack on your land?\" he spluttered to Andy.    \"Why, yes. It is, just right at present.\" Andy admitted, following the  man's example in the matter of a smoke, except that Andy rolled and  lighted a cigarette. \"He's going to move it, though.\"    \"Oh. Thanks.\" With the one-sided smile.    \"Say, you needn't thank ME,\" Andy protested in his polite tone. \"YOU'RE  going to move it, you know.\"    \"You may know, but I don't,\" corrected the other.    \"Oh, that's all right. You may not know right now, but don't let that  worry yuh. This is sure a great country for pilgrims to wise up in.\"    Big Medicine came up over the hill a hundred feet or so from them;  goggled a minute at the bold trespass and came loping across the  intervening space. \"Say, by cripes, what's this mean?\" he bawled.  \"Claim-jumper, hey? Say, young feller, do you realize what you're  doing--squattin' down on another man's land. Don't yuh know  claim-jumpers git shot, out here? Or lynched?\"    \"Oh, cut out all that rough stuff!\" advised the man wearily. \"I know who  you are, and what your bluff is worth. I know you can't held a foot of  land if anybody is a mind to contest your claims. I've filed a contest  on this eighty, here, and I'm going to hold it. Let that soak into your  minds. I don't want any trouble--I'm even willing to take a good deal  in the way of bluster, rather than have trouble. But I'm going to stay.  See?\" He waved his pipe in a gesture of finality and continued to  smoke and to watch them impersonally, leaning against the door in that  lounging negligence which is so irritating to a disputant.    \"Oh, all right--if that's the way you feel about it,\" Andy replied  indifferently, and turned away. \"Come on, boys--no use trying to bluff  that gazabo. He's wise.\"    He rode away with his face turned over his shoulder to see if the others  were going to follow. When he was past the corner and therefore out of  the man's sight, he raised his arm and beckoned to them imperatively,  with a jerk of his head to add insistence. The four of them looked after  him uncertainly. Weary kicked his horse and started, then Pink did  the same. Andy beckoned again, more emphatically than before, and Big  Medicine, who loved a fight as he loved to win a jackpot, turned  and glared at the man in the doorway as he passed. Slim was rumbling  by-golly ultimatums in his fat chest when he came up.    \"Pink, you go on back and put the boys next, when they come up with the  drag they won't do anything much but hand out a few remarks and ride  on.\" Andy said, in the tone of one who knows exactly what he means  to do. \"This is my claim-jumper. Chances are I've got three more to  handle--or will have. Nothing like starting off right. Tell the boys  just rag the fellow a little and ride on, like we did. Get the cattle up  here and set Happy and Slim day-herding and the rest of us'll get busy.\"    \"You wouldn't tell for a dollar, would yuh?\" Pi asked him with his  dimples showing.    \"I've got to think it out first,\" Andy evaded, \"feel all the symptoms of  an idea. You let me alone a while.\"    \"Say, yuh going to tell him he's been found out and yuh know his past,\"  began Slim, \"like yuh done Dunk? I'll bet, by golly--\"    \"Go on off and lay down!\" Andy retorted pettishly. \"I never worked the  same one off on you twice, did I? Think I'm getting feeble-minded? It  ain't hard to put his nibs on the run--that's dead easy. Trouble is I  went and hobbled myself. I promised a lady I'd be mild.\"    \"Mamma!\" muttered Weary, his sunny eyes taking in the shack-dotted  horizon. \"Mild!--and all these jumpers on our hands!\"    \"Oh, well--there's more'n one way to kill a cat,\" Andy reminded them  cheerfully. \"You go on back and post the boys, Pink, not to get too  riled.\"    He galloped off and left them to say and think what they pleased. He was  not uneasy over their following his advice or waiting for his plan. For  Andy Green had risen rapidly to a tacit leadership, since first he  told them of the coming colony. From being the official Ananias of the  outfit, king of all joke-makers, chief irritator of the bunch, whose  lightest word was suspected of hiding some deep meaning and whose  most innocent action was analysed, he had come to the point where  they listened to him and depended upon him to see a way out of  every difficulty. They would depend upon him now; of that he was  sure--therefore they would wait for his plan.    Strange as it may seem, the Happy Family had not seriously considered  the possibility of having their claims \"jumped\" so long as they kept  valid their legal residence. They had thought that they would be watched  and accused of collusion with the Flying U, and they intended to be  extremely careful. They meant to stay upon their claims at least seven  months in the year, which the law required. They meant to have every  blade of grass eaten by their own cattle, which would be counted as  improving their claims. They meant to give a homelike air of permanency  to their dwellings. They had already talked over a tentative plan  of bringing water to their desert claims, and had ridden over the  bench-land for two days, with the plat at hand for reference, that they  might be sure of choosing their claims wisely. They had prepared for  every contingency save the one that had arisen--which is a common  experience with us all. They had not expected that their claims would  be jumped and contests filed so early in the game, as long as they  maintained their residence.    However, Andy was not dismayed at the turn of events. It was stimulating  to the imagination to be brought face to face with an emergency such as  this, and to feel that one must handle it with strength and diplomacy  and a mildness of procedure that would find favor in the eyes of a girl.    He looked across the waving grass to where the four roomed shack was  built upon the four corners of four \"eighties\" so that four women might  live together and yet be said to live upon their own claims. That was  drawing the line pretty fine, of course; finer than the Happy Family  would have dared to draw it. But no one would raise any objection, on  account of their being women and timid about living alone. Andy smiled  sympathetically because the four conjunctive corners of the four claims  happened to lie upon a bald pinnacle bare of grass or shelter or water,  even. The shack stood bleakly revealed to the four winds--but also it  over looked the benchland and the rolling, half-barren land to the  west, which comprised Antelope Coulee and Dry Coulee and several other  good-for-nothing coulees capable of supporting nothing but coyotes and  prairie dogs and gophers.    A mile that way Andy rode, and stopped upon the steep side of a gulch  which was an arm of Antelope Coulee. He looked down into the gulch,  searched with his eyes for the stake that marked the southeast corner of  the eighty lying off in this direction from the shack, and finally saw  it fifty yards away on a bald patch of adobe.    He resisted the temptation to ride over and call upon Miss Allen--the  resistance made easier by the hour, which was eight o'clock or  thereabouts--and rode back to the others very well satisfied with  himself and his plan.    He found the whole Happy Family gathered upon the level land just  over his west line, extolling resentment while they waited his coming.  Grinning, he told them his plan, and set them grinning also. He gave  them certain work to be done, and watched them scatter to do his  bidding. Then he turned and rode away upon business of his own.    The claim-jumper, watching the bench land through a pair of field  glasses, saw a herd of cows and calves scattered and feeding contentedly  upon the young grass a mile or so away. Two men on horseback loitered  upon the outer fringe of the herd. From a distance hilltop came the  staccato sound of hammers where an other shack was going up. Cloud  shadows slid silently over the land, with bright sunlight chasing after.  Of the other horsemen who had come up the bluff with the cattle, he saw  not a sign. So the man yawned and went in to his breakfast.    Many times that day he stood at the corner of his shack with the glasses  sweeping the bench-land. Toward noon the cattle drifted into a coulee  where there was water. In a couple of hours they drifted leisurely  back upon high ground and scattered to their feeding, still watched and  tended by the two horsemen who looked the most harmless of individuals.  One was fat and red-faced and spent at least half of his time lying  prone upon some slope in the shade of his horse. The other was thin  and awkward, and slouched in the saddle or sat upon the ground with his  knees drawn up and his arms clasped loosely around them, a cigarette  dangling upon his lower lip, himself the picture of boredom.    There was nothing whatever to indicate that events were breeding in that  peaceful scene, and that adventure was creeping close upon the watcher.  He went in from his fourth or fifth inspection, and took a nap.    That night he was awakened by a pounding on the side of the shack where  was his window.

The Yoolanlanya and others have Deringara, Gubilla, Koomara, and  Belthara, possibly a defective list, for Mr Mathews adds to these for  the Ullayilinya Lookwara and Ungella (probably a defective set) in  another communication. Two of these are obviously identical with the  Arunta Koomara and Bulthara, with which are associated Purula and  Panungka (13), while Ungilla and Gubilla are taken from the eight-class  system to which we may probably assign the tribe. North-west of the  Arunta, outside the eight-class area, the class names are almost  identical with, though they differ widely in form from the Arunta names.  They are Burong, Ballieri, Baniker, and Caiemurra (13). The form  Boorgarloo is given as a variant. Mrs Bates has found a system (14) in  S.W. Australia.    On the western shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria we find the Mara with  Purdal, Murungun, Mumbali, and Kuial (10); and the Anula with Awukaria,  Roumburia, Urtalia, and Wialia (11).    The only two remaining four-class systems of which the names are known  are on the Annan River with Wandi, Walar, Jorro, and Kutchal (7)--the  Ngarranga of Yorke Peninsula, with Kari, Wani, Wilthi, and Wilthuthu.    Attention has been called in the course of the above exposition to  various cases in which the class names found among one group of tribes  are in part if not entirely identical with those found among their  neighbours. A close examination discloses other possible though hardly  probable points of contact besides those already enumerated. The variant  form Banjoora in 3 seems to be the same as the Banjoor of the Kangulu,  which again has Koorpal in common with 4, and also Kearra, if we may  equate the latter with Kuialla. This again is perhaps the Kuial of the  Mara tribe (9).    The Marroong of 2 seems to be the Maringo of 9, and we may perhaps also  equate the Kurbo of this group with the Kurpal of 4. Irroong resembles  the roanga of the Karandee which is probably the Arawongo of the  Goothanto.    In 5 Wongo suggests the Youingo of 9; it reappears in the Halifax Bay  list, as also does Koorgilla in one of the variants. Again Kubi (1)  corresponds to Koobaroo (5), and Kumbo (Wombee) to Bunburi (Unburi), but  we can hardly regard them as the same words. Koodalla and Koorpal (4)  may be the same as Kellungie and Koopungie (6); the other pair shows no  resemblance.    Possibly the Wiradjeri Wombee is the Kombinegherry Wombo; it is at any  rate significant that the name is found in the portion of the tribe  nearest the Kombinegherry.    We have seen that the Arunta and their north-western neighbours have a  four-class system, the component names of which are found with little  variation over a range of nearly 25 deg. of longitude. In the forms  Kiemarra, Palyeri, Burong, and Baniker, the class names in vogue among  the southern Arunta meet us again near the North-West Cape, thus  covering a larger area than even the widespread Koorgila-Bunburi class  names of Queensland, and forming a striking contrast to the narrow  limits of the majority of the four-class system. This peculiarity is  reproduced in the compact area of the central eight-class tribes, north  and north-east of the Koomara four-class area, though with much greater  variations in the names. Bulthara however in the form Palyeri is found  in more or less disguised shapes in the whole of the eighteen tribes,  whose class names are shown in Table I a; Koomara is found in shapes  which are on the whole harder to recognise, and Panunga and Purula in  two or three cases, either replaced by another word or so changed as to  be unrecognisable. Of the supplementary names belonging to the  eight-class Arunta, Uknaria, Ungalla, Appungerta, Umbitchana, Ungalla is  found in the whole of the tribes under consideration, and Appungerta  undergoes on the whole but little change; Uknaria is practically not  found outside the Arunta area, and Umbitchana is in six cases replaced  by Yacomary, which seems to be a form of Koomara (to this point we recur  later).    Although this suggests that the names were in the first case taken from  the Arunta a comparison of them shows that it is not among this tribe  that the greatest number of forms common to the whole group and the  greatest general resemblance of the names is to be found, as is shown by  the comparative tables below. Judged by the standard of resemblance the  Oolawunga of the north-west, on the Victoria River, have preserved the  names nearest their original forms. Judged by the standard of least  deviation from the common stock of names and basing the comparison, not  on resemblances but on differences, the Koorangie of the upper waters of  the same river take the first place, with the Oolawunga not far behind.  In each case the Inchalachee, the most easterly of the group, take the  last place, followed in the table of resemblances by the Walpari and the  Worgaia; and in the table of differences by the Worgaia and, though at a  considerable distance, the Mayoo and the Walpari.    _Figure of Resemblance_[113].

It is clearly  of high importance to determine whether the resemblance is on the whole  between the names of the western group and the eight-class names, or  whether the latter can more readily be derived from those of the Arunta.  In the latter case it is obvious that the position of the Oolawunga and  Koorangie in the comparative tables is due, not to their having been the  tribes from which all the others derived their names, but rather to  movements of population subsequent to the adoption of the class names.  If on the other hand it appears that the names came in the first  instance from the more western portion of the Koomara group, we have  some grounds for supposing that the names and the system reached the  eight-class area from the west and not from the south.    We have already seen that in the case of Palyeri-Bulthara all the  evidence points to the name having come from the west. In the case of  Panunga the evidence is weaker, certain of the forms being derivable  from either Baniker or Panunga, but with the exception of the  Warramunga, and possibly the Tjingili, there are no tribes of whom we  can definitely say that they took the name from the Arunta, whereas  there are at least four cases where the resemblance is distinctly with  the western class names, and several more in which it can more readily  be derived from them. The resemblance between Koomarra and Kiemarra or  Kiamba is already considerable, and makes it difficult to estimate the  probabilities in most cases; the problem is complicated by the question  of prefixes, which will come up for discussion later, and on the whole  there appears to be no certain solution of the problem, though the Mayoo  seem to have taken over and varied the western form. In the case of  Purula-Burong there appear to be indeterminate cases; six seem to tell  in favour of a southern origin; three suggest a western origin; and one  word Chupil (f. Namilpa) seems to be from a different root.    The problem is further complicated by the anomalous class name Yakomari,  to which allusion has already been made. As will be seen later, _cha_ or  _ja_ seem to be prefixes, and if that is so we can hardly avoid the  conclusion that Yakomari is Koomara or Kiemara. But in the table it  takes the place of Umbitchana, with which it is not even remotely  connected philologically; Jamara and its various forms take the place in  the table occupied by Koomara among the Arunta when Yakomari holds the  eighth place as well as in other cases. If therefore _ku_, _ja_, and  _ya_ are simply prefixes, as seems to be the case, we have this class  name duplicated among five of the tribe--the Umbaia, Yookala, Binbinga,  Worgaia, Yangarella, and Inchalachee, of which one comes near the top,  and two fairly high in the comparative table. It is however worthy of  notice that these six tribes form the eastern group, and are  consequently precisely those among which we should, on the hypothesis  that the class names originated in the western portion of the area,  expect to find the greatest amount of variation and the most numerous  anomalies. Dividing the six tribes into two groups, western and eastern,  each of three tribes, we find that the cumulative resemblance of the  western group to the Arunta is 132, to the Oolawunga 186; the same  figures for the eastern group, more remote from the Oolawunga, but  practically equidistant with the western group from the Arunta, are 91  and 112. This again seems to lend support to the hypothesis of a western  origin. It is perhaps simplest to suppose that the majority of the names  came"]]]
