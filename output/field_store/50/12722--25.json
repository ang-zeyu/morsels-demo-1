And I remember that when I was in Shanghai, Mr.  Tsai, the Mixed Court Magistrate, was reproved by the papers because he  had from the bench expressed his regret that the foreign law of Shanghai  did not permit him to punish in this way a prisoner who had twice  succeeded in breaking from gaol. The hand is cut off for theft, as it  was in England not so many years ago. I have seen men with the tendon of  Achilles cut out, and it is worth noting that the Chinese say that this  \"acquired deformity\" can be cured by the transplantation in the seat of  injury of the tendon of a sheep. One embellishment of the Chinese  punishment of flogging might with good effect be introduced into  England. After a Chinese flagellation, the culprit is compelled to go  down on his knees and humbly thank the magistrate for the trouble he has  been put to to correct his morals.    There is a branch of the _Missions Etrangeres de Paris_ in Chaotong. I  called at the mission and saw their school of fifteen children, and  their tiny little church. One priest lives here solitary and alone; he  was reading, when I entered, the famous Chinese story, \"The Three  Kingdoms.\" He gave me a kindly welcome, and was pleased to talk in his  own tongue. An excellent bottle of rich wine was produced, and over the  glass the Father painted with voluble energy the evil qualities of the  people whom he has left his beautiful home in the Midi of France to lead  to Rome. \"No Chinaman can resist temptation; all are thieves. Justice  depends on the richness of the accused. Victory in a court of justice is  to the richer. Talk to the Chinese of Religion, of a God, of Heaven or  Hell, and they yawn; speak to them of business and they are all  attention. If you ever hear of a Chinaman who is not a thief and a liar,  do not believe it, Monsieur Morrison, do not believe it, they are  thieves and liars every one.\"    For eight years the priest had been in China devoting his best energies  to the propagation of his religion. And sorry had been his recompense.  The best Christian in the mission had lately broken into the mission  house and stolen everything valuable he could lay his impious hands on.  Remembrance of this infamy rankled in his bosom and impelled him to this  expansive panegyric on Chinese virtue.    Some four months ago the good father was away on a holiday, visiting a  missionary brother in an adjoining town. In his absence the mission was  entered through a rift made in the wall, and three hundred taels of  silver, all the money to the last sou that he possessed, were stolen.  Suspicion fell upon a Christian, who was not only an active Catholic  himself, but whose fathers before him had been Catholics for  generations. It was learned that his wife had some of the money, and  that the thief was on his way to Suifu with the remainder. There was  great difficulty in inducing the yamen to take action, but at last the  wife was arrested. She protested that she knew nothing; but, having been  triced up by the wrists joined behind her back, she soon came to reason,  and cried out that, if the magistrate would release her hands, she would  confess all. Two hundred taels were seized in her house and restored to  the priest, and the culprit, her husband, followed to Tak-wan-hsien by  the satellites of the yamen, was there arrested, and was now in prison  awaiting punishment. The goods he purchased were likewise seized and  were now with the poor father.          CHAPTER IX.    MAINLY ABOUT CHINESE DOCTORS.      Chaotong is an important centre for the distribution of medicines to  Szechuen and other parts of the empire. An extraordinary variety of  drugs and medicaments is collected in the city. No pharmacopoeia is more  comprehensive than the Chinese. No English physician can surpass the  Chinese in the easy confidence with which he will diagnose symptoms that  he does not understand. The Chinese physician who witnesses the  unfortunate effect of placing a drug of which he knows nothing into a  body of which he knows less, is no more disconcerted than is his Western  brother under similar circumstances; he retires, sententiously observing  \"there is medicine for sickness but none for fate.\" \"Medicine,\" says the  Chinese proverb, \"cures the man who is fated not to die.\" \"When Yenwang  (the King of Hell) has decreed a man to die at the third watch, no power  will detain him till the fifth.\"    The professional knowledge of a Chinese doctor largely consists in  ability to feel the pulse, or rather the innumerable pulses of his  Chinese patient. This is the real criterion of his skill. The pulses of  a Chinaman vary in a manner that no English doctor can conceive of. For  instance, among the seven kinds of pulse which presage approaching  death, occur the five following:--    \"1. When the pulse is perceived under the fingers to bubble irregularly  like water over a great fire, if it be in the morning, the patient will  die in the evening.    \"2. Death is no farther off if the pulse seems like a fish whose head is  stopped in such a manner that he cannot move, but has a frisking tail  without any regularity; the cause of this distemper lies in the kidneys.    \"3. If the pulse seems like drops of water that fall into a room through  some crack, and when in its return it is scattered and disordered much  like the twine of a cord which is unravelled, the bones are dried up  even to the very marrow.    \"4. Likewise if the motion of the pulse resembles the pace of a frog  when he is embarrassed in the weeds, death is certain.    \"5. If the motion of the pulse resembles the hasty pecking of the beak  of a bird, there is a defect of spirits in the stomach.\"    Heredity is the most important factor in the evolution of a doctor in  China, success in his career as an \"hereditary physician\" being  specially assured to him who has the good fortune to make his first  appearance in the world feet foremost. Doctors dispense their own  medicines. In their shops you see an amazing variety of drugs; you will  occasionally also see tethered a live stag, which on a certain day, to  be decided by the priests, will be pounded whole in a pestle and mortar.  \"Pills manufactured out of a whole stag slaughtered with purity of  purpose on a propitious day,\" is a common announcement in dispensaries  in China. The wall of a doctor's shop is usually stuck all over with  disused plasters returned by grateful patients with complimentary  testimonies to their efficiency; they have done what England is alleged  to expect of all her sons--their duty.    Medicines, it is known to all Chinamen, operate variously according to  their taste, thus:--\"All sour medicines are capable of impeding and  retaining; bitter medicines of causing looseness and warmth as well as  hardening; sweet possess the qualities of strengthening, of harmonising,  and of warming; acids disperse, prove emollient, and go in an athwart  direction; salt medicines possess the properties of descending; those  substances that are hard and tasteless open the orifices of the body and  promote a discharge. This explains the use of the five tastes.\"    Coming from Szechuen, we frequently met porters carrying baskets of  armadillos, leopard skins, leopard and tiger bones. The skins were for  wear, but the armadillos and bones were being taken to Suifu to be  converted into medicine. From the bones of leopards an admirable tonic  may be distilled; while it is well known that the infusion prepared from  tiger bones is the greatest of the tonics, conferring something of the  courage, agility, and strength of the tiger upon its partaker.    Another excellent specific for courage is a preparation made from the  gall bladder of a robber famous for his bravery, who has died at the  hands of the executioner. The sale of such a gall bladder is one of the  perquisites of a Chinese executioner.    Ague at certain seasons is one of the most common ailments of the  district of Chaotong, yet there is an admirable prophylactic at hand  against it: write the names of the eight demons of ague on paper, and  then eat the paper with a cake; or take out the eyes of the paper  door-god (there are door-gods on all your neighbours' doors), and devour  them--this remedy never fails.    Unlike the Spaniard, the Chinese disapproves of blood-letting in fevers,  \"for a fever is like a pot boiling; it is requisite to reduce the fire  and not diminish the liquid in the vessel, if we wish to cure the  patient.\"    Unlike the Spaniard, too, the Chinese doctors would not venture to  assert, as the medical faculty of Madrid in the middle of last century  assured the inhabitants, that \"if human excrement was no longer to be  suffered to accumulate as usual in the streets, where it might attract  the putrescent particles floating in the air, these noxious vapours  would find their way into the human body and a pestilential sickness  would be the inevitable consequence.\"    For boils there is a certain cure:--There is a God of Boils. If you have  a boil you will plaster the offending excrescence without avail, if that  be _all_ you plaster; to get relief you must at the same time plaster  the corresponding area on the image of the God. Go into his temple in  Western China, and you will find this deity dripping with plasters, with  scarcely an undesecrated space on his superficies.    At the yamen of the Brigadier-General in Chaotong, the entrance is  guarded by the customary stone images of mythical shape and grotesque  features. They are believed to represent lions, but their faces are not  leonine--they are a reproduction, exaggerated, of the characteristic  features of the bulldog of Western China. The images are of undoubted  value to the city. One is male and the other female.

MUNN & CO.,    ASK SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEIR SYSTEM OF DOING BUSINESS.    _CONSULTATION AND OPINIONS FREE._    Inventors who desire to consult with MUNN & CO. are invited to call at  their office 37 PARK ROW, or to send a sketch and description of the  invention, which will be examined and an opinion given or sent by mail  without charge.    A SPECIAL EXAMINATION    is made into the novelty of an invention by personal examination at  the Patent Office of all patented inventions bearing on the particular  class. This search is made by examiners of long experience, for which  a fee of $5 is charged. A report is given in writing.    To avoid all possible misapprehension, MUNN & CO. advise generally,  that inventors send models. But the Commissioner may at his discretion  dispense with a model--this can be arranged beforehand.    MUNN & CO. take special care in preparation of drawings and  specifications.    If a case should for any cause be rejected it is investigated  immediately, and the rejection if an improper one set aside.    NO EXTRA CHARGE    is made to clients for this extra service. MUNN & CO. have skillful  experts in attendance to supervise cases and to press them forward  when necessary.    REJECTED CASES.    MUNN & CO. give very special attention to the examination and  prosecution of rejected cases filed by inventors and other attorneys.  In such cases a fee of $5 is required for special examination and  report; and in case of probable success by further prosecution and the  papers are found tolerably well prepared, MUNN & CO. will take up the  case and endeavor to get it through for a reasonable fee to be agreed  upon in advance of prosecution.    CAVEATS    Are desirable if an inventor is not fully prepared to apply for a  Patent. A Caveat affords protection for one year against the issue of  a patent to another for the same invention. Caveat papers should be  carefully prepared.    The Government fee on filing a Caveat is $10, and MUNN & CO.'s charge  for preparing the necessary papers is usually from $10 to $12.    REISSUES.    A patent when discovered to be defective may be reissued by the  surrender of the original patent, and the filing of amended papers.  This proceeding should be taken with great care.    DESIGNS, TRADE-MARKS, & COMPOSITIONS    Can be patented for a term of years, also new medicines or medical  compounds, and useful mixtures of all kinds.    When the invention consists of a medicine or compound, or a new  article of manufacture, or a new composition, samples of the article  must be furnished, neatly put up. There should also be forwarded a  full statement of its ingredients, proportions, mode of preparation,  uses, and merits.    CANADIANS and all other foreigners can now obtain patents upon the  same terms as citizens.    EUROPEAN PATENTS.    MUNN & CO. have solicited a larger number of European Patents than  any other agency. They have agents located at London, Paris, Brussels,  Berlin, and other chief cities. A pamphlet containing a synopsis of  the Foreign Patent Laws sent free.    MUNN & CO. could refer, if necessary, to thousands of patentees who  have had the benefit of their advice and assistance, to many of the  principal business men in this and other cities, and to members of  Congress and prominent citizens throughout the country.
