Bread known as \"ash cake\" was sometimes cooked on the hot coals.    The auction block was located not far from this old home. Here Rhodus  Walton with other young children watched slaves emerge from boxcars,  where they had been packed so closely that there was no room to sit, to  be sold to the highest bidder. This was one of his most vivid  recollections.    As Rhodus' father did not come to this home with his family, he knows  nothing of him. Except for brief intervals his mother worked in the  house where cotton and wool were spun into thread and then woven into  cloth from which the slaves' clothing was made. An elder sister nursed  the master's smaller children. Rhodus' first duties were to drive the  cows to and from the pastures and to keep the calves from annoying the  milkers.    His master was a very cruel man whose favorite form of punishment was to  take a man (or woman) to the edge of the plantation where a rail fence  was located. His head was then placed between two rails so that escape  was impossible and he was whipped until the overseer was exhausted. This  was an almost daily occurrence, administered on the slightest  provocation.    Saturday was the only afternoon off and Christmas was the only vacation  period, but one week of festivities made this season long remembered.  Many \"frolics\" were given and everyone danced where banjoes were  available; also, these resourceful people secured much of their music  from an improvised fiddle fashioned from a hand saw. Immediately after  these festivities, preparations began for spring planting. New ground  was cleared; old land fertilized and the corn fields cleared of last  year's rubbish.    Courtship began at a later age than is customary now but they were much  more brief. Gifts to one's sweetheart were not permitted, but verses  such as:      Roses are red,    Violets blue,    I don't love    No one but you    were invariably recited to the loved one. Young negro men always  \"cocked\" their hats on one side of their heads when they became  interested in the other sex. Marriages were performed by the master.  Common law situations did not exist.    Serious illnesses were not frequent and home remedies compounded of  roots and herbes usually sufficed. Queensy's light root, butterfly  roots, scurry root, red shank root, bull tongue root were all found in  the woods and the teas made from their use were \"cures\" for many  ailments. Whenever an illness necessitated the services of a physician,  he was called. One difference in the old family doctor and those of  today was the method of treatment. The former always carried his  medicine with him, the latter writes prescriptions. The fee was also  much smaller in olden times.    Food was distributed weekly in quantities according to the size of the  family. A single man would receive:      1 pk. meal            on Sunday      1 qt. syrup           flour (seconds)      3-1/2 lbs. meat       Holidays--July 4th and Christmas                                    fresh meat.    Peas, pepper grass, polk salad were plentiful in the fields. Milk and  \"pot likker\" could be had from the big house when desired, although  every family cooked for itself. Saturday afternoon was the general  fishing time and each person might catch as many as he needed for his  personal use.    The slaves did most of the weaving on the plantation, but after the  cloth was woven the problem of giving it color presented itself. As they  had no commercial dye, certain plants were boiled to give color. A plant  called indigo, found in the cotton patch, was the chief type of dye,  although thare was another called copperas. The dresses made from this  material were very plain.    Walton believes in most of the old signs and superstitions because he  has \"watched them and found that they are true.\" The continuous singing  of a whipporwill near a house is a sign of death, but if an iron is  placed in the fire and allowed to remain there, the bird will fly away.    When the news of the war finally reached the plantation, the slaves  followed the progress with keen interest and when battles were fought  near Columbus, and firing of guns was heard, they cried joyfully--\"It  ain't gonna be long now.\" Two of their master's sons fought in the  Confederate Army, but both returned home before the close of the war.  One day news came that the Yankee soldiers were soon to come, and Walton  began to hide all valuables. The slaves were sent to the cemetery to dig  very deep graves where all manner of food was stored. They were covered  like real graves and wooden slabs placed at either end. For three days  before the soldiers were expected, all the house servants were kept busy  preparing delicacies with which to tempt the Yankees and thus avoid  having their place destroyed. In spite of all this preparation, they  were caught unawares and when the \"blue coats\" were seen approaching,  the master and his two sons ran. The elder made his way to the woods;  the younger made away on \"Black Eagle\" a horse reputed to run almost a  mile a minute. Nearly everything on the place was destroyed by these  invaders. One bit of information has been given in every interview where  Northern soldiers visited a plantation, they found, before coming,  whether the Master was mean or kind and always treated him as he had  treated his slaves. Thus Mr. Walton was \"given the works\" as our modern  soldiers would say.    When the war ended the slaves were notified that they were free. Just  before Rhodus' family prepared to move, his mother was struck on the  head by a drunken guest visiting at the \"big house.\" As soon as she  regained consciousness, the family ran off without communicating with an  elder sister who had been sold to a neighbor the previous year. A year  later, news of this sister reached them through a wagoner who recognized  the small boys as he passed them. He carried the news to the family's  new residence back to the lost sister and in a few weeks she arrived at  Cuthbert to make her home with her relatives.    For the past 9 years Rhodus has been unable to work as he is a victim of  a stroke on his left side; both sides have been ruptured, and his nerves  are bad. He attributes his long life to his faith in God.          [HW: Dist. 5  Ex-slave #111  (Ross)]    AN ACCOUNT Of SLAVERY RELATED BY WILLIAM WARD--EX-SLAVE  [Date Stamp: 10-8-1937]      In a small one-room apartment located on one of Atlanta's back streets  lives William Ward, an ex-slave, whose physical appearance in no way  justifies his claim to being 105 years of age. He is about five ft. in  height with a rather smooth brown complexion. What hair he has is gray.  He moves about like a much younger person. For a person of his age his  thoughts and speech are remarkably clear.    On a bright sunny afternoon in September this writer had an opportunity  of talking with Mr. Ward and in the course of the conversation some very  interesting things were learned regarding the institution of slavery and  its customs. Ward took a dip of snuff from his little tin box and began  his story by saying that he is the son of Bill and Leana Ward who were  brought to this country from Jamaica, B.W.I. The first thing he  remembers was the falling of the stars in 1833. From that time until he  was 9 years old he played around the yard with other slave children.  Then his parents were sent back to Jamaica by their master, the former  Governor Joseph E. Brown. While he was in bondage he carried the name of  his masters instead of Ward, his parents' name.    From the age of 9 until he was old enough to do heavy work, he kept the  master's yard clean.    Although Mr. Brown owned between 50 and 75 slaves, he had no plantation  but hired his slaves out to other men who needed more help but were not  able to own as many slaves as their work required.    Mr. Ward and his fellow slaves lived in one-room houses in the rear of  the master's home. The furnishings consisted of a bed which was known as  a \"Grand Rascal\" due to its peculiar construction. The mattress made in  the form of a large bag was stuffed with hat and dried grass.    At daybreak each morning they were called from these crude beds to  prepare for the day's work. Breakfast, which consisted of white bacon,  corn bread, and imitation coffee, was served before they left for the  scene of their day's work. Incidentally the slaves under Mr. Brown's  ownership never had any other form of bread than corn bread.    This imitation coffee was made by putting corn meal in a pan, parching  it until it reached a deep golden brown and steeping it in boiling  water. At noon, dinner was brought to them in the field in wash tubs  placed on carts drawn by oxen. Dinner consisted of fat meat, peas and  corn bread. Often all laundry was done in these same tubs.    The only time that this diet ever varied was at Christmas time when the  master had all slaves gathered in one large field. Then several hogs  were killed and barbecued. Everyone was permitted to eat as much as he  could, but was forbidden to take anything home. When some one was  fortunate enough to catch a possum or a coon, he had a change of food.    On Sundays the slaves were permitted to have a religious meeting of  their own. This usually took place in the back yard or in a building  dedicated for this purpose. They sang spirituals which gave vent to  their true feelings. Many of these songs are sung today. There was one  person who did the preaching. His sermon was always built according to  the master's instructions which were that slaves must always remember  that they belonged to their masters and were intended to lead a life of  loyal servitude. None of the slaves believed this, although they  pretended to believe because of the presence of the white overseer. If  this overseer was absent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#19)"],[1,"ars; he was liable to no such  censure in Nithsdale; he poured out the incense of poetry only on the  fair and captivating: his Jeans, his Lucys, his Phillises, and his  Jessies were ladies of such mental or personal charms as the  Reynolds's and the Lawrences of the time would have rejoiced to lay  out their choicest colours on. But he did not limit himself to the  charms of those whom he could step out to the walks and admire: his  lyrics give evidence of the wandering of his thoughts to the distant  or the dead--he loves to remember Charlotte Hamilton and Mary  Campbell, and think of the sighs and vows on the Devon and the Doon,  while his harpstrings were still quivering to the names of the Millers  and the M'Murdos--to the charms of the lasses with golden or with  flaxen locks, in the valley where he dwelt. Of Jean M'Murdo and her  sister Phillis he loved to sing; and their beauty merited his strains:  to one who died in her bloom, Lucy Johnston, he addressed a song of  great sweetness; to Jessie Lewars, two or three songs of gratitude and  praise: nor did he forget other beauties, for the accomplished Mrs.  Riddel is remembered, and the absence of fair Clarinda is lamented in  strains both impassioned and pathetic.    But the main inspirer of the latter songs of Burns was a young woman  of humble birth: of a form equal to the most exquisite proportions of  sculpture, with bloom on her cheeks, and merriment in her large bright  eyes, enough to drive an amatory poet crazy. Her name was Jean  Lorimer; she was not more than seventeen when the poet made her  acquaintance, and though she had got a sort of brevet-right from an  officer of the army, to use his southron name of Whelpdale, she loved  best to be addressed by her maiden designation, while the poet chose  to veil her in the numerous lyrics, to which she gave life, under the  names of \"Chloris,\" \"The lass of Craigie-burnwood,\" and \"The lassie  wi' the lintwhite locks.\" Though of a temper not much inclined to  conceal anything, Burns complied so tastefully with the growing demand  of the age for the exterior decencies of life, that when the scrupling  dames of Caledonia sung a new song in her praise, they were as  unconscious whence its beauties came, as is the lover of art, that the  shape and gracefulness of the marble nymph which he admires, are  derived from a creature who sells the use of her charms indifferently  to sculpture or to love. Fine poetry, like other arts called fine,  springs from \"strange places,\" as the flower in the fable said, when  it bloomed on the dunghill; nor is Burns more to be blamed than was  Raphael, who painted Madonnas, and Magdalens with dishevelled hair and  lifted eyes, from a loose lady, whom the pope, \"Holy at Rome--here  Antichrist,\" charitably prescribed to the artist, while he laboured in  the cause of the church. Of the poetic use which he made of Jean  Lorimer's charms, Burns gives this account to Thomson. \"The lady of  whom the song of Craigie-burnwood was made is one of the finest women  in Scotland, and in fact is to me in a manner what Sterne's Eliza was  to him--a mistress, or friend, or what you will, in the guileless  simplicity of platonic love. I assure you that to my lovely friend you  are indebted for many of my best songs. Do you think that the sober  gin-horse routine of my existence could inspire a man with life and  love and joy--could fire him with enthusiasm, or melt him with pathos,  equal to the genius of your book? No! no! Whenever I want to be more  than ordinary in song--to be in some degree equal to your diviner  airs--do you imagine I fast and pray for the celestial emanation?  Quite the contrary. I have a glorious recipe; the very one that for  his own use was invented by the divinity of healing and poesy, when  erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus. I put myself in a regimen of  admiring a fine woman; and in proportion to the adorability of her  charms, in proportion are you delighted with my verses. The lightning  of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus, and the witchery of her smile,  the divinity of Helicon.\"    Most of the songs which he composed under the influences to which I  have alluded are of the first order: \"Bonnie Lesley,\" \"Highland Mary,\"  \"Auld Rob Morris,\" \"Duncan Gray,\" \"Wandering Willie,\" \"Meg o' the  Mill,\" \"The poor and honest sodger,\" \"Bonnie Jean,\" \"Phillis the  fair,\" \"John Anderson my Jo,\" \"Had I a cave on some wild distant  shore,\" \"Whistle and I'll come to you, my lad,\" \"Bruce's Address to  his men at Bannockburn,\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" \"Thine am I, my faithful  fair,\" \"Wilt thou be my dearie,\" \"O Chloris, mark how green the  groves,\" \"Contented wi' little, and cantie wi' mair,\" \"Their groves of  sweet myrtle,\" \"Last May a braw wooer came down the long glen,\" \"O  Mally's meek, Mally's sweet,\" \"Hey for a lass wi' a tocher,\" \"Here's  a health to ane I loe dear,\" and the \"Fairest maid on Devon banks.\"  Many of the latter lyrics of Burns were more or less altered, to put  them into better harmony with the airs, and I am not the only one who  has wondered that a bard so impetuous and intractable in most matters,  should have become so soft and pliable, as to make changes which too  often sacrificed the poetry for the sake of a fuller and more swelling  sound. It is true that the emphatic notes of the music must find their  echo in the emphatic words of the verse, and that words soft and  liquid are fitter for ladies' lips, than words hissing and rough; but  it is also true that in changing a harsher word for one more  harmonious the sense often suffers, and that happiness of expression,  and that dance of words which lyric verse requires, lose much of their  life and vigour. The poet's favourite walk in composing his songs was  on a beautiful green sward on the northern side of the Nith, opposite  Lincluden: and his favourite posture for composition at home was  balancing himself on the hind legs of his arm-chair.    While indulging in these lyrical nights, politics penetrated into  Nithsdale, and disturbed the tranquillity of that secluded region.  First, there came a contest far the representation of the Dumfries  district of boroughs, between Patrick Miller, younger, of Dalswinton,  and Sir James Johnstone, of Westerhall, and some two years afterwards,  a struggle for the representation of the county of Kirkcudbright,  between the interest of the Stewarts, of Galloway, and Patrick Heron,  of Kerroughtree. In the first of these the poet mingled discretion  with his mirth, and raised a hearty laugh, in which both parties  joined; for this sobriety of temper, good reasons may be assigned:  Miller, the elder, of Dalswinton, had desired to oblige him in the  affair of Ellisland, and his firm and considerate friend, M'Murdo, of  Drumlanrig, was chamberlain to his Grace of Queensbury, on whoso  interest Miller stood. On the other hand, his old Jacobitical  affections made him the secret well-wisher to Westerhall, for up to  this time, at least till acid disappointment and the democratic  doctrine of the natural equality of man influenced him, Burns, or as a  western rhymer of his day and district worded the reproach--Rob was a  Tory. His situation, it will therefore be observed, disposed him to  moderation, and accounts for the milkiness of his Epistle to Fintray,  in which he marshals the chiefs of the contending factions, and  foretells the fierceness of the strife, without pretending to foresee  the event. Neither is he more explicit, though infinitely more  humorous, in his ballad of \"The Five Carlins,\" in which he  impersonates the five boroughs--Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben,  Sanquhar, and Annan, and draws their characters as shrewd and  calculating dames, met in much wrath and drink to choose a  representative.    But the two or three years which elapsed between the election for the  boroughs, and that for the county adjoining, wrought a serious change  in the temper as well as the opinions of the poet. His Jacobitism, as  has been said was of a poetic kind, and put on but in obedience to old  feelings, and made no part of the man: he was in his heart as  democratic as the kirk of Scotland, which educated him--he  acknowledged no other superiority but the mental: \"he was disposed,  too,\" said Professor Walker, \"from constitutional temper, from  education and the accidents of life, to a jealousy of power, and a  keen hostility against every system which enabled birth and opulence  to anticipate those rewards which he conceived to belong to genius and  virtue.\" When we add to this, a resentment of the injurious treatment  of the dispensers of public patronage, who had neglected his claims,  and showered pensions and places on men unworthy of being named with  him, we have assigned causes for the change of side and the tone of  asperity and bitterness infused into \"The Heron Ballads.\" Formerly  honey was mixed with his gall: a little praise sweetened his censure:  in these election lampoons he is fierce and even venomous:--no man has  a head but what is empty, nor a heart that is not black: men descended  without reproach from lines of heroes are stigmatized as cowards, and  the honest and conscientious are reproached as miserly, mean, and  dishonourable. Such is the spirit of party. \"I have privately,\" thus  writes the poet to Heron, \"printed a good many copies of the ballads,  and have sent them among friends about the country. You have already,  as your auxiliary, the sober detestation of mankind on the heads of  your opponents; find I swear by the lyre of Thalia, to muster on your  side all the votaries of honest laughter and fair, candid ridicule.\"  The ridicule was uncandid, and the laughter dishonest. The poet was  unfortunate in his political attachments: Miller gained the boroughs  which Burns wished he might lose, and Heron lost the county which he  foretold he would gain. It must also be recorded against the good  taste of the poet, that he loved to "]]]
