They may be on the lookout for  us, you know.\"    Once again the boys set their faces toward Oakville, and soon reached  the outskirts of the town.    They were passing some of the stores when Lew Flapp caught sight of  them.    \"Hullo!\" cried the tall boy. \"I declare! there are the three Rover  brothers. What brought them to Oakville?\"    \"We had better not let them see us with this stuff,\" said Pender  hurriedly. \"We'll get into hot water if they do.\"    They lost no time in putting their purchases out of sight. Then they  walked out on the street and stood leaning against the posts of a  wooden awning.    \"There is Flapp and his crowd now,\" said Tom, catching sight of the  trio.    \"We want nothing to do with them,\" said Dick. \"They are not our kind at  all.\"    \"Hullo, Rovers!\" cried Pender as they came up.    \"Hullo, yourself,\" returned Tom coldly.    \"What brought you to town?\" asked Rockley.    \"My feet.\"    \"Thanks. I thought it might have been your ears. They're big enough.\"    At this sally both Flapp and Pender began to laugh.    \"That's a good one,\" said Flapp.    \"I suppose you used your tongue for a walking stick when you came  over,\" said Tom. \"It's long enough.\"    \"Bah!\" cried Rockley, and turned away in disgust.    \"Those Rover boys have got the swelled head,\" muttered Flapp. \"But  we'll turn 'em down before the encampment is over, eh, fellows?\"    \"That's what,\" replied Rockley.    While the Rover boys were making their purchases Lew Flapp and his  cronies turned back into the tavern. There was a billiard room in the  rear and here they began to play billiards.    \"We'll let the Rovers start for home first,\" said Rockley. \"It will be  safer.\"          CHAPTER XXI    A TUG OF WAR      When the Rover boys reached the vicinity of the Staton cottage they  found Alice and Helen in the dooryard, watching for them.    \"Mamma says you must come in,\" said Alice. \"She wishes to see you.\"    \"And papa wants to see you, too,\" added Helen.    \"Thank you, we won't mind resting a bit,\" answered Dick. \"The sun is  rather hot.\"    They were soon seated on the broad porch, and here Mrs. Staton and her  husband were introduced. They proved to be nice people, and both  thanked the boys warmly for what they had done on the road.    \"I've told Isaac Klem about that bull,\" said Mr. Staton. \"Some day  he'll do a whole lot of damage.\"    \"We are going to keep a good lookout for him in the future,\" put in  Alice. \"I don't wish to be scared out of my wits again.\"    Before the boys left Mrs. Staton insisted on treating each to a piece  of apple pie and a glass of milk.    \"What did I tell you about pie?\" whispered Tom. \"Say, but it's all  right, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" whispered Sam.    The girls had a set of croquet on the lawn and asked the boys to play,  but they had to decline for want of time.    All had moved to the rear of the cottage, under a wide-spreading tree,  when Dick chanced to look toward the roadway and uttered an  exclamation:    \"Here come the other fellows now!\"    \"Yes, and look at the packages they are carrying,\" added Sam.    \"And the bottles,\" came from Tom significantly.    Dick was about to step forward when Tom caught him by the arm.    \"Let us keep shady, Dick.\"    \"All right, Tom, if you say so.\"    Sam noticed that the faces of the two girls fell when Flapp and his  cronies went past.    \"Those are some of your chums, I suppose?\" said Helen.    \"They are some of the cadets, but no chums of ours,\" replied Dick.    \"Oh!\"    \"They belong to a little crowd of their own.\" explained Tom. \"We don't  hitch very well, so that is why we let them go by unnoticed.\"    \"We met them at the store in Oakville,\" said Alice.    \"Did they speak to you?\"    \"Yes, but--but we did not want them to.\"    \"Humph!\" said Dick, and then the subject was changed.    Having invited the girls to come and look at the camp some pleasant day  the Rover boys left the cottage and hurried along the road after Lew  Flapp and his cronies.    \"I'll wager those fellows made themselves obnoxious to the girls,\" said  Tom. \"You could tell that by the way the girls looked.\"    \"What do you think they are going to do with the stuff they are  carrying?\" came from Sam.    \"I believe they intend to smuggle it into camp,\" replied Dick. \"And if  that is so, I don't know but what it is my duty to report them.\"    \"If you do that, Flapp will consider you the worst kind of a spy,  Dick.\"    \"Perhaps, but as a captain of the command it is my duty to see that  such things are kept out of camp.\"    \"Well, do what you think is best.\"    \"Better make sure that the stuff they are carrying isn't all right,\"  said Sam. \"They may have nothing but soda in those bottles.\"    They hurried along faster than ever but, strange to say, failed to  catch up to Lew Flapp and his cronies, who were making for the hermit's  den with all possible speed.    \"Maybe they got scared, thinking we might be spying on them,\" suggested  Tom, and hit upon the exact truth of the matter.    After that nearly a week passed in camp without anything unusual  happening. Lew Flapp and his cronies kept their distance, and so strict  was the guard set by Captain Putnam and his assistants that hazing  became, for the time being, out of the question.    To pass the time more pleasantly some of the cadets organized several  tug-of-war teams. This sort of thing pleased Tom very much and he  readily consented to act as anchor man on one of the teams. Another  team had Pender for an anchor man, with Rockley and seven others on the  rope.    \"Let us have a regular contest,\" said one of the cadets, and all was  arranged for a match on the following morning after drill.    The students were enthusiastic over the match, some thinking one side  would win and others favoring the opponents.    \"Tom's crowd will win that match,\" said Sam.    \"What makes you so sure?\" questioned Ben Hurdy.    \"Oh, Tom knows how to pull and how to manage the others.\"    \"And so does Rockley know how to pull,\" continued Hurdy. \"And what is  more, he knows a trick or two that will pull your fellows over the line  in no time.\"    \"I don't believe it, Hurdy.\"    \"Want to bet?\"    \"No, I don't bet. Just the same, I think Rockley's crowd will lose.\"    Although Sam would not bet, some of the other students did, so that by  the time the match was to come off quite a sum was up.    George Strong had been chosen as starter and umpire. On the green a  line of white was laid down, and the team pulling the other over this  line would be the winner.    For the contest Captain Putnam provided a new rope of proper size. To  each end was attached a belt for the anchor men, and there was ample  room on each side of the line for the eight cadets on the rope.    \"All ready?\" questioned George Strong, when the time had come for the  contest.    \"All ready on this end,\" replied Tom, seeing to it that each of his  team was in his proper position and had a proper hold on the rope.    \"All ready here,\" said Rockley, a few seconds later.    \"Drop!\" cried the teacher, and down went the two teams like a flash,  each pulling for all it knew how. But neither gained an inch at the  fall, so the start-off was perfect.    \"Now pull for all you're worth, Rovers!\" cried one cadet.    \"Haul 'em over, Rockleys!\" cried another.    \"Steady, boys!\" whispered Tom. \"Don't get nervous. There is lots of  time.\"    He was almost flat on his back, with both feet braced firmly in the  soil. Rockley was also down, and it looked as if it might be well-nigh  impossible to budge either.    \"This is a dandy tug of war,\" said Fred Garrison. \"Neither has got an  inch of advantage.\"    \"The Rovers will beat!\"    \"The Rockleys will win!\"    \"I think it will be a tie,\" said another.    The strain was terrific and soon each member of the two teams was  bathed in perspiration.    \"Here is where you earn your rations!\" cried one cadet, and this caused  a general laugh.    \"Watch your chances, Tom,\" whispered Dick, and his brother nodded to  show that he understood.    Both sides were glaring at each other. The strain was beginning to  tell, but so far nobody had thought of letting up in the least.    But now Tom saw two of Rockley's men \"getting their wind\" as it is  called. They still held on to the rope, but were hardly pulling at all.    \"Up!\" cried Tom suddenly, and his men went up like a flash. \"Down!\"  came the cry, an instant later, and down they went, before Rockley's  men could recover.    \"Hurrah! the Rovers have gained four inches!\" came the shout. And then  those who favored that team set up a cheer.    It was true, the rope had shifted over four inches. Rockley was angry,  but could do nothing.    \"Mind yourselves, Wilson and Brady!\" he whispered. \"Don't let up a  minute.\"    \"I didn't let up,\" growled Wilson. \"It was Chambers.\"    \"Not much!\" growled Chambers. \"I wasn't--\"    \"Up!\" cried Tom again. \"Down! Up! Pull, pull! pull! Down!\"    Up and down went the team twice, the second time hauling the rope  forward over a foot. Then they went down once more and anchored as  firmly as ever.    \"Good!\" shouted Sam enthusiastically. \"You're doing it, boys! Keep it  up!\"    \"Are they?\" sneered Lew Flapp. \"Just you wait and see.\"    He had a little roll of paper in his hand, and watching his opportunity  he blew the contents into the air, directly over the team led by Tom  Rover. The paper contained pepper and it set several of Tom's men to  sneezing.    This trick had been arranged between Flapp and Rockley, the latter  feeling certain that Tom and his followers could not sneeze and pull at  the same time.    \"Up!\" yelled Rockley. \"Pull! pull! pull!\"    \"Stay down!\" roared Tom. \"Down! Don't give in an inch!\"    But the cry could not be obeyed. Half the team was up and sneezing and  before order could be restored the rope had gone over to the Rockleys'  side a distance of two and a half feet.    \"Hurrah, the Rockleys are winning!\" yelled Ben Hurdy. \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#19)"],[1,"by destitution in producing prostitution and  vagrancy. The following table represents the proportion of persons  charged under the provisions of the Vagrancy Acts in the year 1888:--    Percentage of beggars,                              45 per cent.

It has already been pointed out that persons charged with offences  against the Vagrancy Acts constitute on an average 7 per cent. of the  total annual criminal population. According to the statistics we have  just tabulated, 5 per cent. of these offences are not due to the  pressure of destitution, and only 2 per cent. are to be attributed  to that cause.    Let us now collect the whole of the figures set forth in this chapter,  so that we may be in a position to give an answer to the question with  which we set out, namely, to what extent are theft and vagrancy the  product of destitution?    Proportion of offences against Property and the Vagrancy Acts    to total number of offences tried in 1888,            15 per cent.  Proportion of offenders against property destitute,      2    \"  Proportion of offenders against Vagrancy Acts destitute, 2    \"    Adding together the two classes of offenders against Property and the  Vagrancy Acts who, according to our calculations, are destitute when  arrested, we arrive at the fact that they form four per cent. of the  total criminal population. As has already been pointed out, beggars  and thieves are almost the only two sections of the criminal community  likely to be driven to the commission of lawless acts by the pressure  of absolute want. It very seldom happens that murders, for instance,  are perpetrated from this cause; in fact, not one murder in ten is  even committed for the purpose of theft. The vast majority of the  remaining offences against the criminal law are only connected in a  remote degree with the economic condition of the population, and in  hardly any instance can it be said of them, that they are the outcome  of destitution. In order, however, to err on the safe side, let us  assume that one per cent. of offenders, other than vagrants and  thieves, are to be ranked among the destitute. What is the final  result at which we then arrive with respect to the percentage of  persons forced by the action of destitution into the army of crime? In  the case of vagrants and thieves it has just been seen that the  proportion amounted to four per cent.; adding one per cent. to this  proportion, brings up the total of offenders who probably fall into  crime through the pressure of absolute want to five per cent. of the  annual criminal population tried before the courts.    These figures are important; they demonstrate the fact that although  there was not a single destitute person in the whole of England and  Wales, the annual amount of crime would not be thereby appreciably  diminished. At the present day it is a very common practice to pick  out a case of undoubted hardship here and there, and to assume that  such a case is typical of the whole criminal population. It is, of  course, well to point out such cases, and to emphasise them as much as  possible till we reach such a pitch of excellence in our administration  of the law as will render all unmerited hardship exceedingly rare. As  it is, such cases are becoming less frequent year by year, and it is  an entire mistake to suppose, as is too often done, that a serious  amount of the crime perpetrated in England is committed by men and  women who are willing to work but cannot get it to do. An opinion of  that kind has an alarming tendency to encourage crime; it creates a  false sentiment of compassion for the utterly worthless; it prevents  them from being dealt with according to their deserts, and worst of  all, it is apt to make the working population imagine that there is a  community of interest between them and the criminal classes which does  not in reality exist. From the point of view of public policy nothing  can be more pernicious than to propagate such an idea; and no artisan  who values his own dignity should ever allow any man, whether on  platforms or in newspapers, to identify him in any way whatever with  the common criminal.    Before finally leaving the question of the relations between  destitution and crime, we shall now briefly inquire whether anything  further can be accomplished in the matter of raising our legal and  poor law administration to such a pitch of excellence, that not even  five per cent. of our incriminated population can, with justice, bring  forward any economic pretext whatever for violating the law. As far as  legal administration is concerned, it must be remembered that mistakes  will sometimes occur, no matter how numerous the precautions may be  with which justice is surrounded.    To be certain of justice in all circumstances you must have not only  an infallible law, but also an infallible judge and an infallible  method of criminal administration. It is a truism to say that this is  an impossibility, and every now and again society will have to submit  to be shocked by the revelation of a palpable miscarriage of justice.  At the same time it is important to take every possible precaution  against the occurrence of such distressing accidents. This can only  be effected by placing the administration of the law in all its  departments, from the policeman to the Home Secretary, in the hands of  thoroughly competent officials who have not only their heart, but what  is equally important, their head in the work. When this is done, and  if these officials are not embarrassed by public clamour in the  performance of their duties (honest criticism will do them good), all  will have been accomplished which it is possible to get in the way of  effective and enlightened administration of the law.    In the next place it may be possible to mitigate the operation of our  present poor law system in all cases of destitution through  misadventure. Some prominent politicians--and I believe among them Mr.  Morley--appear to be in favour of this course; and at a recent meeting  of the British Association, Professor Alfred Marshall was inclined to  the belief that a much larger discrimination might be allowed than now  exists in the administration of out-door relief in cases of actual  want; and also that separate and graduated workhouses might be  established for the deserving poor. It will be admitted on all hands  that proposals of this character land us on very delicate ground, and  require the most mature consideration. Even now the inmate of a  workhouse is often better supplied with food, clothing, and shelter  than the poor labourer, who has to pay taxes to support him. If the  condition of that inmate is made still more comfortable, will it be  possible to prevent hundreds and thousands of the very poor, who now  keep outside these institutions, from immediately crowding into them  as soon as the slightest economic difficulties arise? Almost all  philanthropic schemes, and especially all such schemes when supported  by the public purse, have a tendency to be administered with more and  more laxity as time goes on; and a scheme of this kind, if carried  into law, would require to be managed with the utmost circumspection  in order to avoid pauperising great masses of the community.    A scheme of this character will, however, have to be tried if the  manifesto of the Executive Council of the Dockers' Union, issued in  September last, is to be acted upon by Trade-Unionists in general.  According to the doctrine laid down in this manifesto, the idea of a  Trade-Union, as a free and open combination, which every workman may  enter, provided he pays his subscription and conforms to the rules, is  an idea which must for the future be abandoned. Henceforth, a  Trade-Union is to be a close corporation to be worked for the benefit  of persons who have succeeded in getting inside it. The Dockers'  Union, to do them justice, see that this policy is bound to increase  the numbers of the destitute, but they propose to remedy this  condition of things by establishing \"in each municipality factories  and workshops where all those who cannot get work under ordinary  conditions shall have an opportunity afforded them by the community.\"  If these State establishments are to be started for the unemployed,  the workers in them must work at something, and it will have to be  something which the unskilled labourer will not require a great deal  of time to learn. What would the dockers say if one of these  establishments was instituted by the municipality for the loading and  unloading of ships? Hardly a Trade-Union Congress meets in which the  complaint is not made that prison labour interferes with free labour;  but what sort of outcry would there be if State labour, on an  extensive scale, were to enter into serious competition with the  individual workman?    These schemes for the establishment of State institutions offering  work to the indigent will never solve the problem of want, and all  attempts that have hitherto been made in that direction have either  ended in failure or met with small success.    The latest of these schemes is a village settlement, which the  authorities in New Zealand started some time ago to meet the case of  the unemployed. The Government, in the first place, spent L16,000 in  making roads and other conveniences for the settlers, and afterwards"]]]
