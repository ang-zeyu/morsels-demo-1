Materials: Fine canvas; 3 shades of violet floss silk; 4 shades of green  floss silk; sea-green wool, or floss silk; 1 skein of yellow floss silk;  green chenille; cord and tassels.    [Illustration: 196.--Pattern for What-not (full size).]    This small what-not or jewel-stand is very elegant. It is meant to place  upon the toilet-table. No. 195 shows the hammock when completed, No. 196  one-half of the embroidery pattern in full size; it is worked upon fine  canvas. The violets are in floss silk of three shades of violet, with  a raised spot worked in yellow silk in the centre, the leaves are worked  in Berlin wool of various shades of green, and the stems in overcast of  a light green shade. The pattern is grounded in tent stitch with  sea-green silk. The hammock is composed of two sides and an under-piece  cut out in cardboard, covered with the embroidered canvas outside, lined  and quilted with plain green silk inside. It is edged round the top with  green chenille. The mounting is composed of bamboo-canes; the hammock is  fastened on to it with green silk cord, finished off with tassels.           *       *       *       *       *    197.--_Embroidered Handkerchief_.    Materials: Grass lawn or French cambric; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s  embroidery cotton No. 40.    This embroidery pattern is worked between the borders of a handkerchief,  which may be either of French cambric or grass lawn. The design is  simple, but effective, and very easy to work. If worked on fine French  cambric, the handkerchief should be lightly tacked upon _toile ciree_.  The rows of raised dots should be worked first, and then the graceful  branches of pointed leaves in satin stitch. The plain round dots might  be worked in bright red marking cotton in either of the patterns. To  produce a good effect, rather fine cotton must be selected, and No. 40  will be found very effective on either lawn or cambric. For mourning  wear, this pattern should be embroidered with black filoselle, or the  leaves can be worked in white cotton, and the dots in filoselle.

Materials: Light brown russia leather; black, scarlet, and gold silk;  steel or gold clasp.    These medallions are intended to ornament a small purse, but may be  employed on a variety of articles.    [Illustration: 198.--Medallion for a Purse in Embroidery.]    [Illustration: 199.--Medallion for a Purse in Embroidery.]    The raised spots of No. 198 should be worked in black silk, in satin  stitch, the branched sprays in point Russe in scarlet and gold, the four  largest being in scarlet and the intermediate sprays in gold silk.  Medallion No. 199 is worked entirely in point Russe, and may be  embroidered in one colour, or in alternate branches of scarlet and gold,  or scarlet and black.           *       *       *       *       *    200.--_Work-Bag_.    Materials: Drab cloth; small pieces of cloth of different colours;  embroidery silk of different colours; scarlet satin; red silk braid; red  cord; cardboard; cotton wool; and a strap of light-coloured leather.    [Illustration: 200.--Work Bag.]    This work-bag is made in the shape of a rolled-up plaid. The outside  consists of drab cloth, trimmed with applique embroidery. The inside of  the bag is slightly wadded and lined with red satin, which is quilted in  diamonds. The seams are covered with red braid, and a leather strap  completes the whole. Cut out a good pattern in paper, and then cut the  satin and wadding and the drab cloth which forms the outside. After  having traced the pattern on the cloth, work it with small pieces of  coloured cloth in applique embroidery. The different figures are sewn  over the centre partly in point Russe, partly in button-hole stitches,  with embroidery silk. The stems in the middle are worked with silk in  chain stitches. The colours may be chosen according to taste. Cut a  pattern in cardboard, and fasten the drab cloth on it. The edge must be  bordered with red satin, and the satin lining must be sewed in. The ends  of the bag are likewise cut out of cardboard; the inside is wadded and  lined with red satin; the outside worked in applique embroidery like the  rest of the bag. All the seams are covered with red silk cord. The  straps are fastened with a few stitches, as seen in the illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    201 _to_ 203.--_Pattern for Braces_.    Materials: Java canvas; black silk; red wool; calico.    [Illustration: 201.--Pattern for Braces (full size).]    These braces are made of Java canvas lined with calico ornamented with  embroidery in black silk and red wool, and edged on either side with  loose button-hole stitch and crochet vandykes in red wool.  Illustration 201 shows part of the embroidered braces, full size. Work  first the embroidery of the braces, then line them with calico; work  loose button-hole stitch and crochet vandykes on all the edges of the  cross bands as well as at the top and bottom of these strips, and sew on  the tabs for the braces between the lining and the canvas. The latter  are then edged with button-hole stitch and crochet-vandykes. The  vandykes are worked as follow--in one row: 1 double in 1 button-hole  stitch, * 1 purl (3 chain, 1 double in the 1st), missing the next  button-hole stitch under it; 1 double in the following button-hole  stitch, repeat from *. The tabs are made of tape worked round with red  button-hole stitch, with button-holes worked with red cotton. No. 203  shows another    [Illustration: 102.--Embroidered Braces.]    way of working these braces on fine ribbed pique. Work any Berlin wool  work pattern in the common cross stitch over the ribs of the pique. For  the vandyke border work in every other button-hole stitch, 2 double  divided by 3 chain stitches.

Materials: White silk rep; black velvet, rep, or cloth; gold and silver  brocade; gold and silver braid; silk cord and thread.    This pattern is embroidered on white silk rep with silver and gold  thread, and sewn on over a black velvet, rep, or cloth centre. The dark  patterns are worked in applique with black velvet, the two other shades  in gold and silver brocade. The embroidery is worked in satin stitch  with gold and silver braid, silk and cord of the same material. The  border can also be worked upon the material for the centre if it is not  intended to contrast with it. The pattern can also be worked entirely in  silk with satin stitch. The size of the border may, of course, be  increased if desired, but the third pattern in the darkest shade must,  in any case, form the centre of it.

Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery cotton No. 6 and  No. 12; net and muslin.    The pattern must first be traced on muslin, which is then tacked over  net. The outlines are worked in button-hole stitch, and the veinings are  sewn over, using the coarse cotton for tracing; the muslin is then cut  away all round the pattern.           *       *       *       *       *    206.--_Venetian Border._    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery cotton No. 12 and  No. 16; net and muslin.    [Illustration: 206.--Venetian Border.]    This design is elegant and effective, without there being a great deal  of work in it. It is useful for tuckers for evening dresses or  handkerchief borders. The muslin is laid over the net, sewn neatly over,  and then cut away between the pattern, leaving the net for the ground  work.    [Illustration: 207.--Lace Insertion.]           *       *       *       *       *    _207.--Lace Insertion._    Materials: Fine black sewing silk; black Brussels net.    This lace insertion is first outlined in running stitch upon the net;  the leaves are then darned across the net holes; the stems are worked in  overcast stitch; the dots are embroidered by darning across the circle  previously outlined; the lace stitches in the centre are formed by  gently enlarging the net holes with a fine stiletto, and then sewn  lightly round, the remaining holes being filled with lace stitches  consisting of fine button-hole stitches, very evenly worked over the  entire space surrounding the open holes.    To be effective the very finest black silk should be employed. This  pattern may be worked in applique by placing muslin over net, sewing all  the outlines in fine overcast stitch, and when finished, carefully  cutting away the muslin.           *       *       *       *       *    208 _and_ 209.--_Slipper on Java Canvas._    Materials: Light brown Java canvas; green silk; green filoselle and  purse silk; green silk ribbon three-fifths of an inch wide; some  wadding; 2 cork soles.

The last few decades have  created an entirely new foundation for enlightened school work. The  experimental investigations of pedagogical psychology have determined  exactly how the consciousness of the child reacts on the various  methods of teaching and have built up a real systematic economic  learning. All which was left to dilettantic caprice has been  transformed into more or less definite standard forms. For instance,  the old scheme of teaching reading by the alphabet method is  practically eliminated from our modern schools. It is clear that this  learning of the names of the single letters as a starting-point for  the reading of words was not only a wasting of time and energy, but an  actual disturbance in the development of the reading process in the  older generation. As those names of the letters do not occur at all in  the words to be read, but only their sounds, what had been learned in  seeing the single letters had to be inhibited in pronouncing the whole  word. It seems not too much to say that the learning of industrial  activities on the whole still stands on the level of such alphabet  methods, and this cannot be otherwise, as the real problem, namely,  the systematic investigation of the psychophysical activities  involved, has never been brought into the psychological laboratory.    The pedagogical experiment has shown clearly enough that the  subjective feeling of easier or quicker learning may be entirely  unreliable and misleading. If the task is to learn a page by heart, we  may proceed after many different methods. We may learn very small  fractions of the text, repeating only a few words, or we may read  whole paragraphs every time; we may repeat the whole material again  and again, or we may put in long periods of rest after a few  repetitions; we may frequently recite it from memory and have some one  to prompt us; we may give our attention especially to the meaning of  the words, or merely to the sounds, or we may introduce any number of  similar variations. Now the careful experiment shows that of two such  methods one which appears to us the better and more appropriate in  learning, perhaps even as the easier and more comfortable, may prove  itself the less efficient one in the practical result. The psychology  of learning, which won its success by introducing meaningless  syllables as experimental material, has slowly determined the most  reliable methods for impressing knowledge on memory. Where such  results have once been secured, it would surely be a grave mistake  simply to stick to the methods of so-called common sense and to leave  it to the caprice of the individual teacher to decide what method of  learning he will suggest to his pupils. The best method is always the  only one which should be considered. The psychology of economic work  must aim toward similar goals. We must secure a definite knowledge as  to the methods by which a group of movements can best be learned. We  must understand what value is to be attached to the repetitions and to  the pauses, to the imitations and to the special combinations of  movements, to the exercise in parts of the movements, to the rhythm of  the work, and to many similar influences which may shape the learning  process.    The simplest aspect, that of the mere repetition of the movement, has  frequently been examined by psychophysicists. The real founder of  experimental psychology, Fechner, showed the way; he performed  fatiguing experiments with lifted dumb-bells. Then came the time in  which the laboratories began to make a record of the muscular  activities with the help of the ergograph, an instrument with which  the movements of the arm and the fingers can easily be registered on  the smoked surface of a revolving drum. The subtlest variations of the  activity, the increase and decrease of the psychomotor impulse, the  mental fatigue, can be traced exactly in such graphic records. This  psychomotor side of the process, and not the mere muscle activity as  such, is indeed the essential factor which should interest us. The  results of exercise are a training of the central apparatus of the  brain and not of the muscular periphery. The further development of  those experiments soon led to complex questions, which referred not  only to the mere change in the motor efficiency, but to the learning  of particular groups of movements and to the influences on the  exactitude and reliability of the movements. The purely mental factors  of the will-impulse, especially the consciousness of the task, came  into the foreground. These experiences of the scientists concerning  the influences of training, the mechanization of repetition, and the  automatization of movements have been thoroughly discussed by a  brilliant political economist[19] as an explanation of certain  industrial facts, but they have not yet practically influenced life in  the factory.    The nearest approach from the experimental side to the study of the  effect of training in actual industrial tasks may be found in certain  laboratory investigations which refer to the learning of telegraphing,  typewriting, and so on. For instance, we have a careful study[20] of  the progress made in learning telegraphy, both as to the transmitting  of the telegrams by the key movement and the receiving of the  telegrams by the ear. It was found that the rapidity of transmitting  increases more rapidly and more uniformly than the rapidity of  receiving. But while the curve of the latter rises more slowly and  more irregularly, it finally reaches the greater height. The ability  in transmitting, represented by a graphic record, shows an ascent  which corresponds to the typical, steady curve of training. In the  receiving curve, on the other hand, we find not far from the beginning  a characteristic period during which no progress whatever can be  noticed, and this is also repeated at a later stage. The psychological  analysis shows that the increase of ability in the receiving of  telegrams depends upon the development of a complex system of  psychophysical habits. The periods in which the curve does not ascend  represent stages of training in which the elementary habits are  almost completely formed, but have not become sufficiently automatic.  The attention is therefore not yet ready to start habits of a higher  order. The lowest correlation refers to the single letters, after that  to the syllables and words. As soon as the apprentice has reached this  point, he stops, because he must learn to master more and more new  words until his telegraphic vocabulary is large enough to make it  possible for him to turn his consciousness to whole groups of words at  once. Only when this new habit has been made automatic by a training  of several months can he advance to a level at which whole groups of  words are perceived as telegraphic units. A time follows in which this  mastery of whole phrases advances rapidly, until a new period of rest  comes, from which, only after years and often quite suddenly, a last  new ascent can be noticed. Instead of concentrating the attention with  conscious strain on single phrases, the operator progresses to a  perfect liberty in which whole sentences are understood automatically.    We also have a model experimental research into the psychological  conditions of learning in the case of writing on a typewriter.[21] By  electrical connections between the typewriting machine and a system of  levers which registered their movements on the rotating drum of a  kymograph, graph, each striking of a key, each completion of a word,  or of a line, could be recorded in exact time-relations. Each glance  at the copy was also registered. It was found that the process of  learning consisted first of a continuous simplification of the  cumbersome methods with which the beginner commences. A steady  elimination of unfit movements, a selection, a reorganization, and  finally, a combination of psychophysical acts to impulses of higher  order, could be traced exactly. Here, too, the curve of learning at  first rises quickly and then more and more slowly. Of course the usual  fluctuations in the growth of the ability can also be found, and above  all the irregular periods of rest in which the learning itself does  not progress, for some of these so-called plateaus which lie between  the end of one ascent and the beginning of the next may cover a month  and more. At the beginning we have the elementary association between  the single letter and the position of the corresponding key, but soon  an immediate connection between the visual impression of the whole  syllable or the whole word and the total group of movements necessary  to strike the keys for it is developed. The more the ability grows,  the more these psychical impulses of higher order become organized  without conscious intention. The study shows that this development of  higher habits has already begun before the lower habits are fully  settled.    How far the special training involves at the same time a general  training which could be of advantage for other kinds of labor has not  yet been studied at all with reference to industrial technique. There  we are still completely dependent upon certain experiences in the  field of experimental pedagogy, and upon certain statistics, for  instance, in the textile industry. Many patient investigations, with  every independent group of apparatus and machines, may be necessary  before psychotechnics will be able to supply industry with reliable  advice for teaching and learning. Nor have we the least right hastily  to carry over the results from one group of movements to another. Even  where superficially a certain similarity between the technical factors  exists, the psychophysical conditions may be essentially different. In"]]]
