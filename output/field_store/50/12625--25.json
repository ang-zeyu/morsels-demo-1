I have thought that an example of the intelligence (instinct?) of a  class of fish which has come under my observation during my excursions  into the Adirondack region of New York State might possibly be of  interest to your readers, especially as I am not aware that any one  except myself has noticed it, or, at least, has given it publicity.    The female sun-fish (called, I believe, in England, the roach or  bream) makes a \"hatchery\" for her eggs in this wise. Selecting a spot  near the banks of the numerous lakes in which this region abounds, and  where the water is about 4 inches deep, and still, she builds, with  her tail and snout, a circular embankment 3 inches in height and 2  thick. The circle, which is as perfect a one as could be formed with  mathematical instruments, is usually a foot and a half in diameter;  and at one side of this circular wall an opening is left by the fish  of just sufficient width to admit her body, thus:    [Illustration]    The mother sun-fish, having now built or provided her \"hatchery,\"  deposits her spawn within the circular inclosure, and mounts guard at  the entrance until the fry are hatched out and are sufficiently large  to take charge of themselves. As the embankment, moreover, is built up  to the surface of the water, no enemy can very easily obtain an  entrance within the inclosure from the top; while there being only one  entrance, the fish is able, with comparative ease, to keep out all  intruders.    I have, as I say, noticed this beautiful instinct of the sun-fish for  the perpetuity of her species more particularly in the lakes of this  region; but doubtless the same habit is common to these fish in other  waters.

Among the many traces which man has left of his existence in long past  ages on the face of the earth, says a correspondent of the _Scotsman_,  none are more interesting and instructive than the lake dwellings of  Switzerland and other countries, which have been discovered within the  last fifty years or so. Although these relics of the past are far more  modern than those which we referred to in a late article on \"Primeval  Man,\" and are probably included within the range of Egyptian and  other chronologies, yet they stretch far beyond the historic period,  so far as Europe is concerned, and throw a flood of light on the  habits of our ancestors, or at any rate predecessors, in these  regions. We are tolerably well acquainted with the history of the Jews  when David worked his way up from the shepherd's staff to the royal  scepter, or when Joshua drove out the Canaanites and took possession  of their land, but of what was going on in Europe in these times we  have hitherto had no knowledge whatever. These lake dwellings,  however, were in all probability inhabited by human beings somewhere  about the time when the events we have referred to took place, and may  have been inhabited before the earlier of them.    The first hint we had of the existence of these remarkable dwellings  was obtained in 1829, when an excavation was being made on the shore  of a Swiss lake. Some wooden piles, apparently very old, and other  antiquities were found by the workmen. Not much attention, however,  was paid to this discovery till 1854, when a Mr. Aeppli drew attention  to some remains of human handiwork found near his house, in part of  the bed of a lake which had been left dry during a season of great  drought. The workmen employed in recovering some land from the lake  found the heads of a great many wooden piles protruding through the  mud, and also a number of stags' horns, and implements of various  descriptions. Stimulated by this discovery, search was made in various  lakes, and the result was truly astonishing. In every direction  remains of the habitations of prehistoric man were discovered, and  relics were found in such abundance that the history of this unknown  past could be traced through long ages, and the habits of the people  ascertained with a very considerable amount of probability. The  details are so numerous that it would be impossible in the space at  our disposal to go into them all.    Of course, during the long time that has elapsed since these  structures were erected, their remains have been reduced to mere  ruins, and it is only by comparing one with another that we are able  to picture to ourselves what they were originally like and what sort  of life was led by the men who inhabited them. The oldest of these  dwellings belong to the stone age, when man had not acquired any  knowledge of the use of metal; when all his instruments were merely  sharpened stones, fixed in wooden handles, or pieces of bone, horn, or  other natural material. They are therefore somewhat roughly finished,  but at the same time exhibit considerable ingenuity and skill. The  method of construction seems to have been somewhat as follows: A  suitable situation, not far from the shore, where the water was not  very deep, having been fixed upon, these prehistoric builders drove  into the muddy bottom of the lake a number of piles or long stakes,  arranged generally pretty close together, and in some sort of regular  order. These piles were formed generally from stems of trees, with the  bark on, but occasionally from split wood. The ends were sharpened to  a point by the aid of fire or by cutting with stone axes. On a  sufficient number being driven in, and their upper ends brought to a  level above the surface of the water, platform beams were laid across,  fastened by wooden pegs, or in some cases fixed into notches cut in  the heads of the vertical piles. The platform was generally very  roughly made, just a series of unbarked stems placed side by side and  covered with layers of earth or clay, with numerous openings through  which refuse of all kinds fell into the water beneath. In many cases  connection with the shore was made by means of a narrow bridge or  gangway, constructed in the same manner. On this rude platform huts  were erected by driving small piles or stakes which projected above  the floor, and to these were fastened boards standing edgeways like  the skirting of our ordinary rooms, and marking out the size of each  building. The walls of the huts were formed of small branches of twigs  interwoven and plastered over with clay. The roof was made of straw or  reeds like a thatched cottage. In size these huts were probably  eighteen to twenty feet long, eight or ten feet broad, and about six  feet high. They may have been divided into rooms, but there is no  evidence of this. Each was provided with a hearth formed of three or  four slabs of stone. The number of huts in each settlement must have  been considerable, in fact, they must have formed villages of no mean  extent, for as many as forty, fifty, or even a hundred thousand piles  have been found spread over a large extent of ground, forming the  foundation of one such settlement. It is probable, however, that these  were not so numerous when first erected, but were gradually added to  as the population increased. This fact, along with many others, shows  that these dwellings were inhabited for long periods of time, during  which the population pursued their ordinary life in comparative peace  and quietness in their island homes.    Such is, in brief, a general account of these remarkable structures.  Of course there were several variations in the methods of fixing these  piles, one of which may be mentioned as showing the ingenuity of the  builders. Where the piles did not get a firm hold of the lake bottom,  they carried out in boats or rafts loads of stones, which they threw  down between the piles, thus firmly fixing them, just as modern  engineers sometimes do for a similar purpose. As to the habits of the  people who dwelt in these lake dwellings, we get a considerable amount  of information from the various implements, refuse, etc., which fell  through the imperfectly closed platforms into the lake, and which have  been preserved in the mud at the bottom. They were fishers, hunters,  shepherds, and agriculturists. Skeletons of fish are found in large  abundance, and in some settlements even the fishing nets, and hooks  made of boar's tusks, have been discovered. Then again there is an  abundance of remains of the hunter's feast; bones of the stag, wild  boar, bear, wolf, otter, squirrel, and many other wild animals are  found in rich profusion, and often these are split and the marrow  extracted. These ancient men, however, did not entirely rely on such  precarious provision for their wants, but were so far advanced in  civilization that they kept cattle and domestic animals of various  kinds. They possessed dogs in great numbers, as well as cows, sheep,  goats, and pigs, and in winter time had these housed on their  settlements, as among the remains found are litters of straw, etc.,  which had evidently served as bedding for these animals. This, of  course, necessitated the gathering of grass or other material for  their food. They also cultivated wheat, barley, flax, and a number of  other vegetable products. Their methods of cultivation were no doubt  very rude, consisting of a mere scratching of the ground with crooked  branches of trees or with simple instruments made of stags' horn; but,  nevertheless, they succeeded in getting very good results. Among the  relics which they have left are found stones for crushing corn, the  grain which they used, and even the very cakes or bread which they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#19)"],[1,"of gold. There are some, however, who  maintain that copper itself is gold, which by becoming solidified is in a  diseased condition, and hath not therefore reached its own state.    Be that as it may, the real elixir will, in one instant, cause the  substance of copper to attain the state of gold, and will traverse the  seventy-year stages in a single moment. Could this gold be called copper?  Could it be claimed that it hath not attained the state of gold, whilst  the touch-stone is at hand to assay it and distinguish it from copper?    Likewise, these souls, through the potency of the Divine Elixir, traverse,  in the twinkling of an eye, the world of dust and advance into the realm  of holiness; and with one step cover the earth of limitations and reach  the domain of the Placeless. It behooveth thee to exert thine utmost to  attain unto this Elixir which, in one fleeting breath, causeth the west of  ignorance to reach the east of knowledge, illuminates the darkness of  night with the resplendence of the morn, guideth the wanderer in the  wilderness of doubt to the well-spring of the Divine Presence and Fount of  certitude, and conferreth upon mortal souls the honour of acceptance into  the Ridvan of immortality. Now, could this gold be thought to be copper,  these people could likewise be thought to be the same as before they were  endowed with faith.    O brother, behold how the inner mysteries of \"rebirth,\" of \"return,\" and  of \"resurrection\" have each, through these all-sufficing, these  unanswerable, and conclusive utterances, been unveiled and unravelled  before thine eyes. God grant that through His gracious and invisible  assistance, thou mayest divest thy body and soul of the old garment, and  array thyself with the new and imperishable attire.    Therefore, those who in every subsequent Dispensation preceded the rest of  mankind in embracing the Faith of God, who quaffed the clear waters of  knowledge at the hand of the divine Beauty, and attained the loftiest  summits of faith and certitude, these can be regarded, in name, in  reality, in deeds, in words, and in rank, as the \"return\" of those who in  a former Dispensation had achieved similar distinctions. For whatsoever  the people of a former Dispensation have manifested, the same hath been  shown by the people of this latter generation. Consider the rose: whether  it blossometh in the East or in the West, it is none the less a rose. For  what mattereth in this respect is not the outward shape and form of the  rose, but rather the smell and fragrance which it doth impart.    Purge thy sight, therefore, from all earthly limitations, that thou mayest  behold them all as the bearers of one Name, the exponents of one Cause,  the manifestations of one Self, and the revealers of one Truth, and that  thou mayest apprehend the mystic \"return\" of the Words of God as unfolded  by these utterances. Reflect for a while upon the behaviour of the  companions of the Muhammadan Dispensation. Consider how, through the  reviving breath of Muhammad, they were cleansed from the defilements of  earthly vanities, were delivered from selfish desires, and were detached  from all else but Him. Behold how they preceded all the peoples of the  earth in attaining unto His holy Presence--the Presence of God Himself--how  they renounced the world and all that is therein, and sacrificed freely  and joyously their lives at the feet of that Manifestation of the  All-Glorious. And now, observe the \"return\" of the self-same  determination, the self-same constancy and renunciation, manifested by the  companions of the Point of the Bayan.(118) Thou hast witnessed how these  companions have, through the wonders of the grace of the Lord of Lords,  hoisted the standards of sublime renunciation upon the inaccessible  heights of glory. These Lights have proceeded from but one Source, and  these fruits are the fruits of one Tree. Thou canst discern neither  difference nor distinction among them. All this is by the grace of God! On  whom He will, He bestoweth His grace. Please God, that we avoid the land  of denial, and advance into the ocean of acceptance, so that we may  perceive, with an eye purged from all conflicting elements, the worlds of  unity and diversity, of variation and oneness, of limitation and  detachment, and wing our flight unto the highest and innermost sanctuary  of the inner meaning of the Word of God.    From these statements therefore it hath been made evident and manifest  that should a Soul in the \"End that knoweth no end\" be made manifest, and  arise to proclaim and uphold a Cause which in \"the Beginning that hath no  beginning\" another Soul had proclaimed and upheld, it can be truly  declared of Him Who is the Last and of Him Who was the First that they are  one and the same, inasmuch as both are the Exponents of one and the same  Cause. For this reason, hath the Point of the Bayan--may the life of all  else but Him be His sacrifice!--likened the Manifestations of God unto the  sun which, though it rise from the \"Beginning that hath no beginning\"  until the \"End that knoweth no end,\" is none the less the same sun. Now,  wert thou to say, that this sun is the former sun, thou speakest the  truth; and if thou sayest that this sun is the \"return\" of that sun, thou  also speakest the truth. Likewise, from this statement it is made evident  that the term \"last\" is applicable to the \"first,\" and the term \"first\"  applicable to the \"last;\" inasmuch as both the \"first\" and the \"last\" have  risen to proclaim one and the same Faith.    Notwithstanding the obviousness of this theme, in the eyes of those that  have quaffed the wine of knowledge and certitude, yet how many are those  who, through failure to understand its meaning, have allowed the term  \"Seal of the Prophets\" to obscure their understanding, and deprive them of  the grace of all His manifold bounties! Hath not Muhammad, Himself,  declared: \"I am all the Prophets?\" Hath He not said as We have already  mentioned: \"I am Adam, Noah, Moses, and Jesus?\" Why should Muhammad, that  immortal Beauty, Who hath said: \"I am the first Adam\" be incapable of  saying also: \"I am the last Adam\"? For even as He regarded Himself to be  the \"First of the Prophets\"--that is Adam--in like manner, the \"Seal of the  Prophets\" is also applicable unto that Divine Beauty. It is admittedly  obvious that being the \"First of the Prophets,\" He likewise is their  \"Seal.\"    The mystery of this theme hath, in this Dispensation, been a sore test  unto all mankind. Behold, how many are those who, clinging unto these  words, have disbelieved Him Who is their true Revealer. What, We ask,  could this people presume the terms \"first\" and \"last\"--when referring to  God--glorified be His Name!--to mean? If they maintain that these terms bear  reference to this material universe, how could it be possible, when the  visible order of things is still manifestly existing? Nay, in this  instance, by \"first\" is meant no other than the \"last\" and by \"last\" no  other than the \"first.\"    Even as in the \"Beginning that hath no beginnings\" the term \"last\" is  truly applicable unto Him who is the Educator of the visible and of the  invisible, in like manner, are the terms \"first\" and \"last\" applicable  unto His Manifestations. They are at the same time the Exponents of both  the \"first\" and the \"last.\" Whilst established upon the seat of the  \"first,\" they occupy the throne of the \"last.\" Were a discerning eye to be  found, it will readily perceive that the exponents of the \"first\" and the  \"last,\" of the \"manifest\" and the \"hidden,\" of the \"beginning\" and the  \"seal\" are none other than these holy Beings, these Essences of  Detachment, these divine Souls. And wert thou to soar in the holy realm of  \"God was alone, there was none else besides Him,\" thou wilt find in that  Court all these names utterly non-existent and completely forgotten. Then  will thine eyes no longer be obscured by these veils, these terms, and  allusions. How ethereal and lofty is this station, unto which even  Gabriel, unshepherded, can never attain, and the Bird of Heaven,  unassisted, can never reach!    And, now, strive thou to comprehend the meaning of this saying of 'Ali,  the Commander of the Faithful: \"Piercing the veils of glory, unaided.\"  Among these \"veils of glory\" are the divines and doctors living in the  days of the Manifestation of God, who, because of their want of  discernment and their love and eagerness for leadership, have failed to  submit to the Cause of God, nay, have even refused to incline their ears  unto the divine Melody. \"They have thrust their fingers into their  ears.\"(119) And the people also, utterly ignoring God and taking them for  their masters, have placed themselves unreservedly under the authority of  these pompous and hypocritical leaders, for they have no sight, no  hearing, no heart, of their own to distinguish truth from falsehood.    Notwithstanding the divinely-inspired admonitions of all the Prophets, the  Saints, and Chosen ones of God, enjoining the people to see with their own  eyes and hear with their own ears, they have disdainfully rejected their  counsels and have blindly followed, and will continue to follow, the  leaders of their Faith. Should a poor and obscure person, destitute of the  attire of men of learning, address them saying: \"Follow ye, O people! the  Messengers of God,\"(120) they would, greatly surprised at such a  statement, reply: \"What! Meanest thou that all these divines, all these  exponents of learning, with all their authority, their pomp and pageantry,  have erred, and failed to distinguish truth from falsehood? Dost thou, and  people like thyself, pretend to have comprehended that which they have not  understood?\" If numbers and excellence of apparel be regarded as the  criterions of learning and truth, the peoples of a bygone age, whom those  of today have never surpassed in numbers, magnificence and"]]]
