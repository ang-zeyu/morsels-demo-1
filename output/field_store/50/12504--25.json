The  mean weight of both sexes in old age is that which they had at 19.    When the male and female have assumed their complete development they  weigh almost exactly 20 times as much as at birth, while the stature  is about 3-1/2 times greater. Children lose weight during the first  three days after birth; at the age of a week they sensibly increase;  after one year they triple their weight; then they require six years  to double their weight, and 13 to quadruple it.    It has been computed that nearly two years' sickness is experienced by  every person before he is 70 years old, and therefore that 10 days per  annum is the average sickness of human life. Till 40 it is but half,  and after 50 it rapidly increases. The mixed and fanciful diet of man  is considered the cause of numerous diseases from which animals are  exempt. Many diseases have abated with changes of diet, and others are  virulent in particular countries, arising from peculiarities.    Human Longevity.--Of 100,000 male and female children, in the first  month they are reduced to 90,396, or nearly a tenth. In the second,  to 87,936. In the third, to 86,175. In the fourth, to 84,720. In the  fifth, to 83,571. In the sixth, to 82,526, and at the end of the first  year to 77,528, the deaths being 2 to 9. The next four years reduce  the 77,528 to 62,448, indicating 37,552 deaths before the completion  of the fifth year.    At 25 years the 100,000 are half, or 49,995; at 52, one-third. At  58-1/2, a fourth, or 25,000; at 67, a fifth; at 76, a tenth; at 81, a  twentieth, or 5,000; and ten attain 100. Children die in large  proportions because their diseases cannot be explained, and because the  organs are not habituated to the functions of life. The mean of life  varies in different countries from 40 to 45. A generation from father to  son is about 30 years; of men in general five-sixths die before 70, and  fifteen-sixteenths before 80. After 80 it is rather endurance than  enjoyment. The nerves are blunted, the senses fail, the muscles are  rigid, the softer tubes become hard, the memory fails, the brain  ossifies, the affections are buried, and hope ceases. The remaining  one-sixteenth die at 80; except a one-thirty-third, at 90. The remainder  die from inability to live, at or before 100.    About the age of 36 the lean man usually becomes fatter and the fat  man leaner. Again, between the years of 43 and 50 his appetite fails,  his complexion fades, and his tongue is apt to be furred on the least  exertion of body or mind. At this period his muscles become flabby,  his joints weak; his spirits droop, and his sleep is imperfect and  unrefreshing. After suffering under these complaints a year, or  perhaps two, he starts afresh with renewed vigor, and goes on to 61 or  62, when a similar change takes place, but with aggravated symptoms.  When these grand periods have been successively passed, the gravity of  incumbent years is more strongly marked, and he begins to boast of his  age.    In Russia, much more than in any other country, instances of longevity  are numerous, if true. In the report of the Holy Synod, in 1827,  during the year 1825, and only among the Greek religion, 848 men had  reached upward of 100 years of age; 32 had passed their 120th year, 4  from 130 to 135. Out of 606,818 men who died in 1826, 2,765 were above  90; 1,432 above 95, and 848 above 100 years of age. Among this last  number 88 were above 115; 24 more than 120; 7 above 125, and one 130.  Riley asserts that Arabs in the Desert live 200 years.    On the average, men have their first-born at 30 and women at 28.  The greatest number of deliveries take place between 25 and 35. The  greatest number of deliveries take place in the winter months, and in  February, and the smallest in July, i.e., to February, as 4 to 5 in  towns and 3 to 4 in the country. The night births are to the day as 5  to 4.    Human Strength.--In Schulze's experiments on human strength, he found  that men of five feet, weighing 126 lbs., could lift vertically 156  lbs. 8 inches; 217 lbs. 1.2 inches. Others, 6.1 feet, weighing 183  lbs., 156 lbs. 13 inches, and 217 lbs. 6 inches; others 6 feet 3  inches, weighing 158 lbs., 156 lbs. 16 inches, and 217 lbs. 9 inches.  By a great variety of experiments he determined the mean human  strength at 30 lbs., with a velocity of 2.5 feet per second; or it is  equal to the raising half a hogshead 10 feet in a minute.      RULES FOR SPELLING.    Words ending in _e_ drop that letter before the termination _able_,  as in move, movable; unless ending in _ce_ or _ge_, when it is  retained, as in change, changeable, etc.    Words of one syllable, ending in a consonant, with a single vowel  before it, double the consonants in derivatives; as, ship, shipping,  etc. But if ending in a consonant with a double vowel before it, they  do not double the consonant in derivatives; as, troop, trooper, etc.    Words of more than one syllable, ending in a consonant preceded by a  single vowel, and accented on the last syllable, double that consonant  in derivatives; as, commit, committed; but except chagrin, chagrined.    All words of one syllable ending in _l_, with a single vowel before  it, have _ll_ at the close; as mill, sell. All words of one syllable  ending in _l_, with a double vowel before it, have only one _l_ at the  close; as mail, sail.    The words foretell, distill, instill and fulfill, retain the _ll_  of their primitives. Derivatives of dull, skill, will and full also  retain the _ll_ when the accent falls on these words; as dullness,  skillfull, willfull, fullness.    Words of more than one syllable ending in _l_ have only one _l_ at the  close; as delightful, faithful; unless the accent falls on the last  syllable; as befall, etc.    Words ending in _l_, double the letter in the termination _ly_.    Participles ending in _ing_, from verbs ending in _e_, lose the final  _e_; as have, having; make, making, etc; but verbs ending in _ee_  retain both; as see, seeing. The word dye, to color, however, must  retain the _e_ before _ing_. All verbs ending in _ly_, and nouns  ending in _ment_, retain the _e_ final of the primitives; as brave,  bravely; refine, refinement; except words ending in _dge_; as,  acknowledge, acknowledgment.    Nouns ending in _y_, preceded by a vowel, form their plural by adding  _s_; as money, moneys; but if _y_ is preceded by a consonant, it is  changed to _ies_ in the plural; as bounty, bounties.    Compound words whose primitives end in _y_, change the _y_ into _i_;  as beauty, beautiful.      THE USE OF CAPITALS.    Every entire sentence should begin with a capital.    Proper names, and adjectives derived from these, should begin with a  capital.    All appellations of the Deity should begin with a capital. Official  and honorary titles should begin with a capital.    Every line of poetry should begin with a capital.    Titles of books and the heads of their chapters and divisions are  printed in capitals.    The pronoun I and the exclamation O are always capitals.    The days of the week and the months of the year begin with capitals.    Every quotation should begin with a capital letter.    Names of religious denominations begin with capitals.    In preparing accounts each item should begin with a capital.    Any word of very special importance may begin with a capital.      TWENTY CHOICE COURSE DINNER MENUS.    1.

He held out his arms to me, and  I ran to him; but even in so brief an interval I had perceived that he  was terribly weak and wasted.    All my memories of his past faults had vanished and were dead in that  sad aspect of his worn features, and in the conviction which I felt,  even from the first moment, that he had but little time longer to remain  with us. I knelt by him on the floor, and with my arms round his neck,  embraced him tenderly, not finding any place for words, but only sobbing  in great anguish. Neither of us spoke, and my weariness from long travel  and the strangeness of the situation caused me to feel that paralysing  sensation of doubt as to the reality of the scene, and even of my own  existence, which all, I believe, have experienced at times of severe  mental tension. That I, a plain English girl, should be kneeling here  beside my brother in the Italian dawn; that I should read, as I  believed, on his young face the unmistakable image and superscription  of death; and reflect that within so few months he had married, had  wrecked his home, that my poor Constance was no more;--these things  seemed so unrealisable that for a minute I felt that it must all be a  nightmare, that I should immediately wake with the fresh salt air of  the Channel blowing through my bedroom window at Worth, and find I had  been dreaming. But it was not so; the light of day grew stronger and  brighter, and even in my sorrow the panorama of the most beautiful spot  on earth, the Bay of Naples, with Vesuvius lying on the far side, as  seen then from these windows, stamped itself for ever on my mind. It was  unreal as a scene in some brilliant dramatic spectacle, but, alas! no  unreality was here. The flames of the candles in their silver sconces  waxed paler and paler, the lines and shadows on my brother's face grew  darker, and the pallor of his wasted features showed more striking in  the bright rays of the morning sun.          CHAPTER XIII      I had spent near a week at the Villa de Angelis. John's manner to me  was most tender and affectionate; but he showed no wish to refer to the  tragedy of his wife's death and the sad events which had preceded it, or  to attempt to explain in any way his own conduct in the past. Nor did  I ever lead the conversation to these topics; for I felt that even if  there were no other reason, his great weakness rendered it inadvisable  to introduce such subjects at present, or even to lead him to speak at  all more than was actually necessary. I was content to minister to him  in quiet, and infinitely happy in his restored affection. He seemed  desirous of banishing from his mind all thoughts of the last few months,  but spoke much of the years before he had gone to Oxford, and of happy  days which we had spent together in our childhood at Worth Maltravers.  His weakness was extreme, but he complained of no particular malady  except a short cough which troubled him at night.    I had spoken to him of his health, for I could see that his state was  such as to inspire anxiety, and begged that he would allow me to see if  there was an English doctor at Naples who could visit him. This he would  not assent to, saying that he was quite content with the care of an  Italian doctor who visited him almost daily, and that he hoped to be  able, under my escort, to return within a very short time to England.    \"I shall never be much better, dear Sophy,\" he said one day. \"The doctor  tells me that I am suffering from some sort of consumption, and that I  must not expect to live long. Yet I yearn to see Worth once more, and to  feel again the west winds blowing in the evening across from Portland,  and smell the thyme on the Dorset downs. In a few days I hope perhaps to  be a little stronger, and I then wish to show you a discovery which I  have made in Naples. After that you may order them to harness the  horses, and carry me back to Worth Maltravers.\"    I endeavoured to ascertain from Signor Baravelli, the doctor, something  as to the actual state of his patient; but my knowledge of Italian was  so slight that I could neither make him understand what I would be at,  nor comprehend in turn what he replied, so that this attempt was  relinquished. From my brother himself I gathered that he had begun to  feel his health much impaired as far back as the early spring, but  though his strength had since then gradually failed him, he had not been  confined to the house until a month past. He spent the day and often  the night reclining on his sofa and speaking little. He had apparently  lost the taste for the violin which had once absorbed so much of his  attention; indeed I think the bodily strength necessary for its  performance had probably now failed him. The Stradivarius instrument  lay near his couch in its case; but I only saw the latter open on one  occasion, I think, and was deeply thankful that John no longer took  the same delight as heretofore in the practice of this art,--not only  because the mere sound of his violin was now fraught to me with such  bitter memories, but also because I felt sure that its performance had  in some way which I could not explain a deleterious effect upon himself.  He exhibited that absence of vitality which is so often noticeable in  those who have not long to live, and on some days lay in a state of  semi-lethargy from which it was difficult to rouse him. But at other  times he suffered from a distressing restlessness which forbade him to  sit still even for a few minutes, and which was more painful to watch  than his lethargic stupor. The Italian boy, of whom I have already  spoken, exhibited an untiring devotion to his master which won my heart.  His name was Raffaelle Carotenuto, and he often sang to us in the  evening, accompanying himself on the mandoline. At nights, too, when  John could not sleep, Raffaelle would read for hours till at last  his master dozed off. He was well educated, and though I could not  understand the subject he read, I often sat by and listened, being  charmed with his evident attachment to my brother and with the melodious  intonation of a sweet voice.    My brother was nervous apparently in some respects, and would never be  left alone even for a few minutes; but in the intervals while Raffaelle  was with him I had ample opportunity to examine and appreciate the  beauties of the Villa de Angelis. It was built, as I have said, on some  rocks jutting into the sea, just before coming to the Capo di Posilipo  as you proceed from Naples. The earlier foundations were, I believe,  originally Roman, and upon them a modern villa had been constructed  in the eighteenth century, and to this again John had made important  additions in the past two years. Looking down upon the sea from the  windows of the villa, one could on calm days easily discern the remains  of Roman piers and moles lying below the surface of the transparent  water; and the tufa-rock on which the house was built was burrowed with  those unintelligible excavations of a classic date so common in the  neighbourhood. These subterraneous rooms and passages, while they  aroused my curiosity, seemed at the same time so gloomy and repellent  that I never explored them. But on one sunny morning, as I walked at  the foot of the rocks by the sea, I ventured into one of the larger of  these chambers, and saw that it had at the far end an opening leading  apparently to an inner room. I had walking with me an old Italian female  servant who took a motherly interest in my proceedings, and who, relying  principally upon a very slight knowledge of English, had constituted  herself my body-guard. Encouraged by her presence, I penetrated this  inner room and found that it again opened in turn into another, and so  on until we had passed through no less than four chambers.    They were all lighted after a fashion through vent-holes which somewhere  or other reached the outer air, but the fourth room opened into a fifth  which was unlighted. My companion, who had been showing signs of alarm  and an evident reluctance to proceed further, now stopped abruptly and  begged me to return. It may have been that her fear communicated itself  to me also, for on attempting to cross the threshold and explore the  darkness of the fifth cell, I was seized by an unreasoning panic and by  the feeling of undefined horror experienced in a nightmare. I hesitated  for an instant, but my fear became suddenly more intense, and springing  back, I followed my companion, who had set out to run back to the outer  air. We never paused until we stood panting in the full sunlight by the  sea. As soon as the maid had found her breath, she begged me never to go  there again, explaining in broken English that the caves were known in  the neighbourhood as the \"Cells of Isis,\" and were reputed to be haunted  by demons. This episode, trifling as it may appear, had so great an  effect upon me that I never again ventured on to the lower walk which  ran at the foot of the rocks by the sea.    In the house above, my brother had built a large hall after the ancient  Roman style, and this, with a dining-room and many other chambers, were  decorated in the fashion of those discovered at Pompeii. They had been  furnished with the utmost luxury, and the beauty of the paintings,  furniture, carpets, and hangings was enhanced by statues in bronze and  marble. The villa, indeed, and its fittings were of a kind to which  I was little used, and at the same time of such beauty that I never  ceased to regard all as a creation of an enchanter's wand, or as the  drop-scene to some drama which might suddenly be raised and disappear  from my sight. The house, in short, together with its furniture, was,  I believe, intended to be a reproduction of an ancient Roman villa,  and had something about it repellent to my rustic and insular "]]]
