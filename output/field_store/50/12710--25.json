Mr. and Mrs.  Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and  shaking hands with every person individually, as he or she went out,  wished him or her a Merry Christmas!           *       *       *       *       *        CHRISTMAS BELLS        JOHN KEBLE        Wake me to-night, my mother dear,      That I may hear      The Christmas Bells, so soft and clear,      To high and low glad tidings tell,      How God the Father loved us well;      How God the Eternal Son      Came to undo what we had done.           *       *       *       *       *          III    SIGNIFICANCE AND SPIRIT              A CHRISTMAS CARMEN        JOHN G. WHITTIER        I        Sound over all waters, reach out from all lands,      The chorus of voices, the clasping of hands;      Sing hymns that were sung by the stars of the morn,      Sing songs of the angels when Jesus was born!          With glad jubilations          Bring hope to the nations!      The dark night is ending and dawn has begun:      Rise, hope of the ages, arise like the sun,          All speech flow to music, all hearts beat as one!        II        Sing the bridal of nations! with chorals of love      Sing out the war-vulture and sing in the dove,      Till the hearts of the peoples keep time in accord      And the voice of the world is the voice of the Lord!          Clasp hands of the nations          In strong gratulations:      The dark night is ending and dawn has begun;      Rise, hope of the ages, arise like the sun,          All speech flow to music, all hearts beat as one!        III        Blow, bugles of battle, the marches of peace;      East, west, north, and south let the long quarrel cease:      Sing the song of great joy that the angels began,      Sing of glory to God and of good-will to man!          Hark! joining in chorus          The heavens bend o'er us!      The dark night is ending and dawn has begun;      Rise, hope of the ages, arise like the sun,          All speech flow to music, all hearts beat as one!           *       *       *       *       *    THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS    From \"Pickwick Papers.\"    CHARLES DICKENS    And numerous indeed are the hearts to which Christmas brings a brief  season of happiness and enjoyment. How many families whose members have  been dispersed and scattered far and wide, in the restless struggles of  life, are then re-united, and meet once again in that happy state of  companionship and mutual good-will, which is a source of such pure and  unalloyed delight, and one so incompatible with the cares and sorrows of  the world, that the religious belief of the most civilized nations, and  the rude traditions of the roughest savages, alike number it among the  first joys of a future state of existence, provided for the blest and  happy! How many old recollections, and how many dormant sympathies, does  Christmas time awaken!    We write these words now, many miles distant from the spot at which,  year after year, we met on that day, a merry and joyous circle. Many of  the hearts that throb so gaily then, have ceased to beat; many of the  looks that shone so brightly then, have ceased to glow; the hands we  grasped, have grown cold; the eyes we sought, have hid their lustre in  the grave; and yet the old house, the room, the merry voices and smiling  faces, the jest, the laugh, the most minute and trivial circumstance  connected with those happy meetings, crowd upon our mind at each  recurrence of the season, as if the last assemblage had been but  yesterday. Happy, happy Christmas, that can win us back to the delusions  of our childish days, that can recall to the old man the pleasures of  his youth, and transport the sailor and the traveller, thousands of  miles away, back to his own fireside and his quiet home!           *       *       *       *       *    ON GOOD WISHES AT CHRISTMAS    FRISWELL    At Christmas, which is a good holiday for most of us, but especially for  that larger and better half of us, the young, there is, as everybody  knows, a profusion of good things. The final cause of a great many  existences is Christmas Day. How many of that vast flock of geese, which  are now peacefully feeding over the long, cold wolds of Norfolk, or are  driven gabbling and hissing by the gozzard to their pasture--how many of  those very geese were called into being simply for Christmas Day! In the  towns, with close streets and fetid courts, where the flaring gas at the  corner of an alley marks the only bright spot, a gin-palace, there a  goose-club is held; and there, for a short time, is the resting-place,  side by side with a bottle of gin, of one of those wise-looking and  self-concentrated gobblers, whose name men have generally, and, as we  think, unjustly, applied to the silly one amongst themselves.    But it is only the profusion of good things, of cakes, puddings, spices,  oranges, and fruits, from sunny Italy and Spain, from India and from  Asia, from America, North and South, and even from distant Australia; it  is not that amongst us, as long ago with the _Franklin_ in Chaucer, that  at this time--        \"It snowes in our house      Of meate and drinke;\"    it is not that we have huge loads of beef chines, ribs, sirloins, legs,  necks, breasts, and shoulders of mutton, fillets of veal, whole hogs,  and pigs in various stages, from the tender suckling to the  stiff-jointed father of a family, whose \"back hair\" makes good  clothes-brushes, and whose head is brought in at college feasts; it is  not that the air gives up its choicest fowl, and the waters yield their  best fish: plentiful as these are with us, they are nothing in profusion  to the kindly greeting and good wishes that fly about in the cold  weather, and that circulate from land's end to land's end. The whole  coast of England is surrounded by a general \"shake hands.\" The  coast-guard on their wintry walks do not greet each other more surely  than old friends all over England do: one clasps another, and another a  third, till from Dover to London and so on to York, from Yarmouth on the  east to Bristol on the west, from John O'Groat's house at the extreme  north to the Land's End, the very toe-nail of England on the south--a  kindly greeting, we may be sure, will pass. And a cheerful thing it is,  on this day of universal equality, on this day which--        \"To the cottage and the crown,      Brought tidings of salvation down,\"    to think that we can touch and hold each other with friendly hands all  over our land. We all of us shake hands on Christmas Day. Leigh Hunt had  a quaint fancy that he had, as it were, by lineal descent, shaken hands  with Milton. He would argue thus: he knew a man who had shaken hands  with Dr. Johnson, who had clasped the hand of him who had shaken  Dryden's right hand, who himself had thus greeted Andrew Marvell, who  knew Master Elwood, the Quaker friend of Milton, who knew Milton  himself; and thus, though our Sovereign has her hand kissed, not shaken,  by her subjects, yet doubtless she will clasp the hands of her children,  who, shaking those of others, will let the greeting and the good wishes  descend to the lowest on that ladder of society which we are all trying  to climb.    As for hearty good wishes, spoken in all kinds of voices, from the  deepest bass to the shrillest treble, we are sure that they circulate  throughout the little island, and are borne on the wings of the post all  over the seas. Erasmus, coming to England in Henry VIII's time, was  struck with the deep heartiness of our wishes--good, ay, and bad too;  but he most admired the good ones. Other nations ask in their greetings  how a man carries himself, or how doth he stand with the world, or how  doth he find himself; but the English greet with a pious wish that God  may give one a good morning or a good evening, good day, or \"god'd'en,\"  as the old writers have it; and when we part we wish that \"God may be  with you,\" though we now clip it into \"Good b'ye.\"           *       *       *       *       *        A CHRISTMAS SONG        WILLIAM COX BENNETT          Blow, wind, blow,      Sing through yard and shroud;      Pipe it shrilly and loud,        Aloft as well as below;      Sing in my sailor's ear      The song I sing to you,      \"Come home, my sailor true,      For Christmas that comes so near.\"          Go, wind, go,      Hurry his home-bound sail,      Through gusts that are edged with hail,        Through winter, and sleet, and snow;      Song, in my sailor's ear,      Your shrilling and moans shall be,      For he knows they sing him to me      And Christmas that comes so near.           *       *       *       *       *        SERY        RICHARD WATSON GILDER        With wild surprise      Four great eyes      In two small heads,      From neighboring beds      Looked out--and winked--      And glittered and blinked      At a very queer sight      In the dim starlight.        As plain as can be      A fairy tree      Flashes and glimmers      And shakes and shimmers.      Red, green and blue      Meet their view;      Silver and gold      Their sharp eyes behold;      Small moon, big stars;      And jams in jars,      And cakes, and honey      And thimbles, and money,      Pink dogs, blue cats,      Little squeaking rats,      And candles, and dolls,      And crackers, and polls,      A real bird that sings,      And tokens and favors,      And all sorts of things      For the little shavers.        Four black eyes      Grow big with surprise;      And then grow bigger      When a tiny figure,      Jaunty and airy,      (Is it a fairy?)      From the tree-top cries,      \"Open wide! Black Eyes!      Come, children, wake now!      Your joys you may take now!\"        Quick as you can think        Twenty small toes        In four pretty rows,      Like little piggies pink,        All kick in the air--      And before you can wink        The tree stands bare!           *       *       *       *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#19)"],[1,"town.    Forty flags with their silver stars,  Forty flags with their crimson bars,    Flapped in the morning wind; the sun  Of noon looked down, and saw not one.    Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,  Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;    Bravest of all in Frederick town,  She took up the flag the men hauled down;    In her attic window the staff she set,  To show that one heart was loyal yet.    Up the street came the rebel tread,  Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.    Under his slouched hat left and right  He glanced; the old flag met his sight.    \"Halt!\"--the dust-brown ranks stood fast.  \"Fire!\"--out blazed the rifle-blast.    It shivered the window, pane and sash;  It rent the banner with seam and gash.    Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff  Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;    She leaned far out on the window-sill,  And shook it forth with a royal will.    \"Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,  But spare your country's flag,\" she said.    A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,  Over the face of the leader came;    The nobler nature within him stirred  To life at that woman's deed and word:    \"Who touches a hair of yon gray head  Dies like a dog; march on!\" he said.    All day long through Frederick street  Sounded the tread of marching feet;    All day long that free flag tost  Over the heads of the rebel host.    Ever its torn folds rose and fell  On the loyal winds that loved it well;    And through the hill-gaps sunset light  Shone over it a warm good night.    Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er.  And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.    Honor to her! and let a tear  Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.    Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,  Flag of freedom and Union wave!    Peace and order and beauty draw  Round thy symbol of light and law;    And ever the stars above look down  On thy stars below in Frederick town.        _John G. Whittier._          I Want to Go to Morrow      I started on a journey just about a week ago,  For the little town of Morrow, in the State of Ohio.  I never was a traveler, and really didn't know  That Morrow had been ridiculed a century or so.  I went down to the depot for my ticket and applied  For the tips regarding Morrow, not expecting to be guyed.  Said I, \"My friend, I want to go to Morrow and return  Not later than to-morrow, for I haven't time to burn.\"    Said he to me, \"Now let me see if I have heard you right,  You want to go to Morrow and come back to-morrow night.  You should have gone to Morrow yesterday and back to-day,  For if you started yesterday to Morrow, don't you see,  You could have got to Morrow and returned to-day at three.  The train that started yesterday--now understand me right--  To-day it gets to Morrow, and returns to-morrow night.\"    Said I, \"My boy, it seems to me you're talking through your hat,  Is there a town named Morrow on your line? Now tell me that.\"  \"There is,\" said he, \"and take from me a quiet little tip--  To go from here to Morrow is a fourteen-hour trip.  The train that goes to Morrow leaves to-day eight-thirty-five;  Half after ten to-morrow is the time it should arrive.  Now if from here to Morrow is a fourteen-hour jump,  Can you go to-day to Morrow and come back to-day, you chump?\"    Said I, \"I want to go to Morrow; can I go to-day  And get to Morrow by to-night, if there is no delay?\"  \"Well, well,\" said he, \"explain to me and I've no more to say;  Can you go anywhere to-morrow and come back from there to-day?\"  For if to-day you'd get to Morrow, surely you'll agree  You should have started not to-day, but yesterday, you see.  So if you start to Morrow, leaving here to-day, you're flat,  You won't get to Morrow till the day that follows that.    \"Now if you start to-day to Morrow, it's a cinch you'll land  To-morrow into Morrow, not to-day, you understand.  For the train to-day to Morrow, if the schedule is right,  Will get you into Morrow by about to-morrow night.\"  Said I, \"I guess you know it all, but kindly let me say,  How can I go to Morrow, if I leave the town to-day?\"  Said he, \"You cannot go to Morrow any more to-day,  For the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way.\"      FINALE    I was so disappointed I was mad enough to swear;  The train had gone to Morrow and had left me standing there.  The man was right in telling me I was a howling jay;  I didn't go to Morrow, so I guess I'll go to-day.          Out in the Fields      The little cares that fretted me,    I lost them yesterday  Among the fields above the seas,    Among the winds at play;  Among the lowing of the herds,    The rustling of the trees,  Among the singing of the birds,    The humming of the bees.    The foolish fears of what might happen,--    I cast them all away  Among the clover-scented grass,     Among the new-mown hay;  Among the husking of the corn,    Where drowsy poppies nod,  Where ill thoughts die and good are born,    Out in the fields with God.        _Elizabeth Barrett Browning._          The Bluebird's Song      I know the song that the bluebird is singing,  Out in the apple tree where he is swinging.  Brave little fellow! the skies may be dreary--  Nothing cares he while his heart is so cheery.    Hark! how the music leaps out from his throat!  Hark! was there ever so merry a note?  Listen a while, and you'll hear what he's saying,  Up in the apple tree swinging and swaying.    \"Dear little blossoms down under the snow,  You must be weary of winter I know.  Listen, I'll sing you a message of cheer!  Summer is coming! and springtime is here!    \"Little white snowdrop! I pray you arise;  Bright yellow crocus! please open your eyes;  Sweet little violets, hid from the cold,  Put on your mantles of purple and gold;  Daffodils! Daffodils! say, do you hear?--  Summer is coming, and springtime is here!\"        _Emily Huntington Miller._          The Main Truck, or a Leap for Life      Old Ironsides at anchor lay,    In the harbor of Mahon;  A dead calm rested on the bay,--    The waves to sleep had gone;  When little Hal, the Captain's son,    A lad both brave and good,  In sport, up shroud and rigging ran,    And on the main truck stood!    A shudder shot through every vein,--    All eyes were turned on high!  There stood the boy, with dizzy brain,    Between the sea and sky;  No hold had he above, below;    Alone he stood in air:  To that far height none dared to go,--    No aid could reach him there.    We gazed, but not a man could speak,--    With horror all aghast,--  In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,--    We watched the quivering mast.  The atmosphere grew thick and hot,    And of a lurid hue;--  As riveted unto the spot,    Stood officers and crew.    The father came on deck:--he gasped,    \"Oh, God; thy will be done!\"  Then suddenly a rifle grasped,    And aimed it at his son.  \"Jump, far out, boy, into the wave!    Jump, or I fire,\" he said;  \"That only chance your life can save;    Jump, jump, boy!\" He obeyed.    He sunk,--he rose,--he lived,--he moved,--    And for the ship struck out.  On board we hailed the lad beloved,    With many a manly shout.  His father drew, in silent joy,    Those wet arms round his neck,  And folded to his heart his boy,--    Then fainted on the deck.        _Morris._          The Arrow and the Song      I shot an arrow into the air,  It fell to earth, I knew not where;  For, so swiftly it flew, the sight  Could not follow it in its flight.    I breathed a song into the air,  It fell to earth, I knew not where;  For who has sight so keen and strong,  That it can follow the flight of song?    Long, long afterward, in an oak  I found the arrow, still unbroke;  And the song, from beginning to end,  I found again in the heart of a friend.        _H.W. Longfellow._          The Green Mountain Justice      \"The snow is deep,\" the Justice said;  \"There's mighty mischief overhead.\"  \"High talk, indeed!\" his wife exclaimed;  \"What, sir! shall Providence be blamed?\"  The Justice, laughing, said, \"Oh no!  I only meant the loads of snow  Upon the roofs. The barn is weak;  I greatly fear the roof will break.  So hand me up the spade, my dear,  I'll mount the barn, the roof to clear.\"  \"No!\" said the wife; \"the barn is high,  And if you slip, and fall, and die,  How will my living be secured?--  Stephen, your life is not insured.  But tie a rope your waist around,  And it will hold you safe and sound.\"  \"I will,\" said he. \"Now for the roof--  All snugly tied, and danger-proof!  Excelsior! Excel--But no!  The rope is not secured below!\"  Said Rachel, \"Climb, the end to throw  Across the top, and I will go  And tie that end around my waist.\"  \"Well, every woman to her taste;  You always would be tightly laced.  Rachel, when you became my bride,  I thought the knot securely tied;  But lest the bond should break in twain,  I'll have it fastened once again.\"  Below the arm-pits tied around,  She takes her station on the ground,  While on the roof, beyond the ridge,  He shovels clear the lower edge.  But, sad mischance! the loosened snow  Comes sliding down, to plunge below.  And as he tumbles with the slide,  Up Rachel goes on t'other side.  Just half-way down the Justice hung;  Just half-way up the woman swung.  \"Good land o' Goshen!\" shouted she;  \"Why, do you see it?\" answered he.    The couple, dangling in the breeze,  Like turkeys hung outside to freeze,  At their rope's end and wits' end, too,  Shout back and forth what best to do.  Cried Stephen, \"Take it coolly, wife;  All have their ups and downs in life.\"  Quoth Rachel, \"What a pity 'tis  To joke at such a thing as this!  A man whose wife is being hung  Should know enough to hold his tongue.\"  \"Now, Rachel, as I look below,  I see a tempting heap of snow.  Suppose, my dear, I take my knife,  And cut the rope to save my life?\"  She shouted, \"Don't! 'twould be my death--  I see some pointed stones beneath.  A better way would be to call,  With all our might, for Phebe Hall.\"  \"Agreed!\" he roared. First he,"]]]
