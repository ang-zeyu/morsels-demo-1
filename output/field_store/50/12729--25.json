[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#19)"],[1,"The world of existence is an emanation of the merciful attribute of God.  God has shone forth upon the phenomena of being through His effulgence of  mercy and He is clement and kind to all His creation. Therefore the world  of humanity must ever be the recipient of bounties from the eternal Lord;  even as His Holiness Christ has declared, \"Be ye perfect even as your  Father which is in heaven.\" For His bounties like the light and heat of  the sun in the material heavens descend alike upon all mankind.  Consequently man must learn the lesson of kindness and beneficence from  God Himself. Just as God is kind to all humanity, man also must be kind to  his fellow creatures. If his attitude is just and loving toward his fellow  men, toward all creation, then indeed is he worthy of being pronounced the  image and likeness of God.    Brotherhood or fraternity is of different kinds. It may be family  association, the intimate relationship of the household. This is limited  and subject to change and disruption. How often it happens that in a  family, love and agreement are changed into enmity and antagonism. Another  form of fraternity is manifest in patriotism. Man loves his fellow-men  because they belong to the same nativity. This is also limited and subject  to change and disintegration, as for instance when sons of the same  fatherland are opposed to each other in war, bloodshed and battle. Still  another brotherhood or fraternity is that which arises from racial unity,  the oneness of racial origin, producing ties of affinity and association.  This likewise has its limitation and liability to change, for often war  and deadly strife have been witnessed between people and nations of the  same racial lineage. There is a fourth kind of brotherhood, the attitude  of man toward humanity itself, the altruistic love of humankind and  recognition of the fundamental human bond. Although this is unlimited it  is nevertheless susceptible to change and destruction. Even from this  universal fraternal bond the looked-for result does not appear. What is  the looked-for result? Loving-kindness among all human creatures and a  firm, indestructible brotherhood which includes all the divine  possibilities and significances in humanity. Therefore it is evident that  fraternity, love and kindness based upon family, nativity, race or an  attitude of altruism are neither sufficient nor permanent since all of  them are limited, restricted and liable to change and disruption. For in  the family there is discord and alienation; among sons of the same  fatherland strife and internecine warfare are witnessed; between those of  a given race, hostility and hatred are frequent; and even among the  altruists varying aspects of opinion and lack of unselfish devotion give  little promise of permanent and indestructible unity among mankind.    Therefore the Lord of mankind has caused His holy divine Manifestations to  come into the world. He has revealed His heavenly books in order to  establish spiritual brotherhood, and through the power of the Holy Spirit  has made it practicable for perfect fraternity to be realized among  mankind. And when through the breaths of the Holy Spirit this perfect  fraternity and agreement are established amongst men, this brotherhood and  love being spiritual in character, this loving-kindness being heavenly,  these constraining bonds being divine, a unity appears which is  indissoluble, unchanging and never subject to transformation. It is ever  the same and will forever remain the same. For example consider the  foundation of the brotherhood laid by His Holiness Christ. Observe how  that fraternity was conducive to unity and accord and how it brought  various souls to a plane of uniform attainment where they were willing to  sacrifice their lives for each other. They were content to renounce  possessions and ready to joyously forfeit life itself. They lived together  in such love and fellowship that even Galen, the famous Greek philosopher,  who was not a Christian, in his work entitled \"The Progress of the  Nations\" says that religious beliefs are greatly conducive to the  foundation of real civilization. As a proof thereof he says, \"A certain  number of people contemporaneous with us are known as Christians. These  enjoy the superlative degree of moral civilization. Each one of them is a  great philosopher because they live together in the utmost love and  good-fellowship. They sacrifice life for each other. They offer worldly  possessions for each other. You can say of the Christian people that they  are as one person. There is a bond amongst them that is indissoluble in  character.\"    It is evident therefore that the foundation of real brotherhood, the cause  of loving co-operation and reciprocity and the source of real kindness and  unselfish devotion is none other than the breaths of the Holy Spirit.  Without this influence and animus it is impossible. We may be able to  realize some degrees of fraternity through other motives but these are  limited associations and subject to change. When human brotherhood is  founded upon the Holy Spirit, it is eternal, changeless, unlimited.    In various parts of the Orient there was a time when brotherhood,  loving-kindness and all the praiseworthy qualities of mankind seemed to  have disappeared. There was no evidence of patriotic, religious or racial  fraternity but conditions of bigotry, hatred and prejudice prevailed  instead. The adherents of each religion were violent enemies of the  others, filled with the spirit of hostility and eager for shedding of  blood. The present war in the Balkans furnishes a parallel of these  conditions. Consider the bloodshed, ferocity and oppression manifested  there even in this enlightened century; all of it based fundamentally upon  religious prejudice and disagreement. For the nations involved belong to  the same races and nativities, nevertheless they are savage and merciless  toward each other. Similar deplorable conditions prevailed in Persia in  the nineteenth century. Darkness and ignorant fanaticism were widespread;  no trace of fellowship or brotherhood existed amongst the races. On the  contrary, human hearts were filled with rage and hatred; darkness and  gloom were manifest in human lives and conditions everywhere. At such a  time as this His Holiness Baha'u'llah appeared upon the divine horizon,  even as the glory of the sun, and in that gross darkness and hopelessness  of the human world there shone a great light. He founded the oneness of  the world of humanity, declaring that all mankind are as sheep and that  God is the real and true shepherd. The shepherd is one and all people are  of his flock.    The world of humanity is one and God is equally kind to all. What then is  the source of unkindness and hatred in the human world? This real shepherd  loves all his sheep. He leads them in green pastures. He rears and  protects them. What then is the source of enmity and alienation among  humankind? Whence this conflict and strife? The real underlying cause is  lack of religious unity and association for in each of the great religions  we find superstition, blind imitation of creeds, and theological formulae  adhered to instead of the divine fundamentals, causing difference and  divergence among mankind instead of agreement and fellowship. Consequently  strife, hatred and warfare have arisen, based upon this divergence and  separation. If we investigate the foundations of the divine religions, we  find them to be one, absolutely changeless and never subject to  transformation. For example each of the divine religions contains two  kinds of laws or ordinances. One division concerns the world of morality  and ethical institutions. These are the essential ordinances. They instill  and awaken the knowledge and love of God, love for humanity, the virtues  of the world of mankind, the attributes of the divine kingdom, rebirth and  resurrection from the kingdom of nature. These constitute one kind of  divine law which is common to all and never subject to change. From the  dawn of the Adamic cycle to the present day this fundamental law of God  has continued changeless. This is the foundation of divine religion.    The second division comprises laws and institutions which provide for  human needs and conditions according to exigencies of time and place.  These are accidental, of no essential importance and should never have  been made the cause and source of human contention. For example during the  time of His Holiness Moses--Upon him be peace! --according to the exigencies  of that period, divorce was permissible. During the cycle of His Holiness  Christ inasmuch as divorce was not in conformity with the time and  conditions His Holiness Jesus Christ abrogated it. In the cycle of Moses  plurality of wives was permissible but during the time of His Holiness  Christ the exigency which had sanctioned it did not exist, therefore it  was forbidden. His Holiness Moses lived in the wilderness and desert of  Sinai; therefore his ordinances and commandments were in conformity with  those conditions. The penalty for theft was to cut off a man's hand. An  ordinance of this kind was in keeping with desert life but not compatible  with conditions of the present day. Such ordinances therefore constitute  the second or non-essential division of the divine religions and are not  of importance for they deal with human transactions which are ever  changing according to the requirements of time and place. Therefore the  intrinsic foundations of the divine religions are one. As this is true,  why should hostility and strife exist among them? Why should this hatred  and warfare, ferocity and bloodshed continue? Is this allowable and  justified? God forbid!            RELIGION RENEWED      Creation is the expression of motion. Motion is life. A moving object is a  living object whereas that which is motionless and inert is as dead."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#19)"],[1,"'u'llah is the promotion of education.  Every child must be instructed in sciences as much as is necessary. If the  parents are able to provide the expenses of this education, it is all  right, otherwise the community must provide the means for the teaching of  that child.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is justice and right.  Until these are realized on the plane of existence, all things shall be in  disorder and remain imperfect. The world of mankind is a world of  oppression and cruelty, and a realm of aggression and error.    In fine, such teachings are numerous. These manifold principles, which  constitute the greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and are of the  bounties of the Merciful, must be added to the matter of Universal Peace  and combined with it, so that results may accrue. Otherwise the  realization of Universal Peace (by itself) in the world of mankind is  difficult. As the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah are combined with  Universal Peace, they are like a table provided with every kind of fresh  and delicious food. Every soul can find, at that table of infinite bounty,  that which he desires. If the question is restricted to Universal Peace  alone, the remarkable results which are expected and desired will not be  attained. The scope of Universal Peace must be such that all the  communities and religions may find their highest wish realized in it. At  present the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah are such that all the  communities of the world, whether religious, political or ethical, ancient  or modern, find in the teachings of Baha'u'llah the expression of their  highest wish.    For example, the people of religions find, in the teaching of His Holiness  Baha'u'llah, the establishment of Universal Religion--a religion that  perfectly conforms with present conditions, which in reality effects the  immediate cure of the incurable disease, which relieves every pain, and  bestows the infallible antidote for every deadly poison. For if we wish to  arrange and organize the world of mankind in accordance with the present  religious imitations and thereby to establish the felicity of the world of  mankind, it is impossible and impracticable--for example, the enforcement  of the laws of the Old Testament (Torah) and also of the other religions  in accordance with present imitations. But the essential basis of all the  Divine Religions which pertains to the virtues of the world of mankind and  is the foundation of the welfare of the world of man, is found in the  teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah in the most perfect presentation.    Similarly, with regard to the peoples who clamor for freedom: the moderate  freedom which guarantees the welfare of the world of mankind and maintains  and preserves the universal relationships, is found in its fullest power  and extension in the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah.    So with regard to political parties: that which is the greatest policy  directing the world of mankind, nay, rather, the Divine policy, is found  in the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah.    Likewise with regard to the party of \"equality\" which seeks the solution  of the economic problems: until now all proposed solutions have proved  impracticable except the economic proposals in the teachings of His  Holiness Baha'u'llah which are practicable and cause no distress to  society.    So with the other parties: when ye look deeply into this matter, ye will  discover that the highest aims of those parties are found in the teachings  of Baha'u'llah. These teachings constitute the all-inclusive power among  all men and are practicable. But there are some teachings of the past,  such as those of the Torah, which cannot be carried out at the present  day. It is the same with the other religions and the tenets of the various  sects and the different parties.    For example, the question of Universal Peace, about which His Holiness  Baha'u'llah says that the Supreme Tribunal must be established: although  the League of Nations has been brought into existence, yet it is incapable  of establishing Universal Peace. But the Supreme Tribunal which His  Holiness Baha'u'llah has described will fulfil this sacred task with the  utmost might and power. And His plan is this: that the national assemblies  of each country and nation--that is to say parliaments--should elect two or  three persons who are the choicest men of that nation, and are well  informed concerning international laws and the relations between  governments and aware of the essential needs of the world of humanity in  this day. The number of these representatives should be in proportion to  the number of inhabitants of that country. The election of these souls who  are chosen by the national assembly, that is, the parliament, must be  confirmed by the upper house, the congress and the cabinet and also by the  president or monarch so these persons may be the elected ones of all the  nation and the government. From among these people the members of the  Supreme Tribunal will be elected, and all mankind will thus have a share  therein, for every one of these delegates is fully representative of his  nation. When the Supreme Tribunal gives a ruling on any international  question, either unanimously or by majority-rule, there will no longer be  any pretext for the plaintiff or ground of objection for the defendant. In  case any of the governments or nations, in the execution of the  irrefutable decision of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent or dilatory,  the rest of the nations will rise up against it, because all the  governments and nations of the world are the supporters of this Supreme  Tribunal. Consider what a firm foundation this is! But by a limited and  restricted League the purpose will not be realized as it ought and should.  This is the truth about the situation, which has been stated.    Consider how powerful are the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah. At a  time when His Holiness was in the prison of Akka and was under the  restrictions and threats of two bloodthirsty kings, notwithstanding this  fact, His teachings spread with all power in Iran and other countries.  Should any teaching, or any principle, or any community fall under the  threat of a powerful and bloodthirsty monarch it will be annihilated  within a short space of time. At present for fifty years the Baha'is in  Iran and most regions have been under severe restrictions and the threat  of sword and spear. Thousands of souls have given their lives in the arena  of sacrifice and have fallen as victims under the swords of oppression and  cruelty. Thousands of esteemed families have been uprooted and destroyed.  Thousands of children have been made fatherless. Thousands of fathers have  been bereft of their sons. Thousands of mothers have wept and lamented for  their boys who have been beheaded. All this oppression and cruelty,  rapacity and blood-thirstiness did not hinder or prevent the spread of the  teachings of Baha'u'llah. They spread more and more every day, and their  power and might became more evident.    It may be that some foolish person among the Iranians will affix his name  to the contents of the Tablets of His Holiness Baha'u'llah or to the  explanations given in the letters of 'Abdu'l-Baha and send it to that  esteemed Assembly. Ye must be aware of this fact, for any Iranian who  seeks fame or has some other intention will take the entire contents of  the Tablets of His Holiness Baha'u'llah and publish them in his own name  or in that of his community, just as happened at the Universal Races  Congress in London before the war. An Iranian took the substance of the  Epistles of His Holiness Baha'u'llah, entered that Congress, gave them  forth in his own name and published them, whereas the wording was exactly  that of His Holiness Baha'u'llah. Some such souls have gone to Europe and  have caused confusion in the minds of the people of Europe and have  disturbed the thoughts of some Orientalists. Ye must bear this fact in  mind, for not a word of these teachings was heard in Iran before the  appearance of Baha'u'llah. Investigate this matter so that it may become  to you evident and manifest. Some souls are like parrots. They learn any  note which they may hear, and sing it, but they themselves are unaware of  what they utter. There is a sect in Iran at present made up of a few souls  who are called Babis, who claim to be followers of His Holiness the Bab,  whereas they are utterly unaware of His Holiness. They have some secret  teachings which are entirely opposed to the teachings of Baha'u'llah and  in Iran people know this. But when these souls come to Europe, they  conceal their own teachings and utter those of His Holiness Baha'u'llah,  for they know that the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah are powerful  and they therefore declare publicly those teachings of Baha'u'llah in  their own name. As to their secret teachings, they say that they are taken  from the Book of Bayan, and the Book of Bayan is from His Holiness the  Bab. When ye get hold of the translation of the Book of Bayan, which has  been translated in Iran, ye will discover the truth that the teachings of  Baha'u'llah are utterly opposed to the teachings of this sect. Beware lest  ye disregard this fact. Should ye desire to investigate the matter  further, inquire from Iran.    In fine, when traveling and journeying throughout the world, wherever one  finds construction, it is the result of fellowship and love, while  everything that is in ruin shows the effect of enmity and hatred.  Notwithstanding this, the world of humanity has not become aware and has  not awakened from the sleep of heedlessness. Again it engages in  differences, in disputes and wrangling, that it may set up ranks of war  and may run to and fro in the arena of battle and strife.    So it is with regard to the universe and its corruption, existence and  non-existence. "]]]
