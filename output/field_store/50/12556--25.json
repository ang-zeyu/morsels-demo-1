[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#19)"],[1,"philosophy of history.]    It is natural that the old philosophy of history should have fixed its  attention upon the geographic basis of historical events. Searching for  the permanent and common in the outwardly mutable, it found always at  the bottom of changing events the same solid earth. Biology has had the  same experience. The history of the life forms of the world leads always  back to the land on which that life arose, spread, and struggled for  existence. The philosophy of history was superior to early sociology, in  that its method was one of historical comparison, which inevitably  guided it back to the land as the material for the first generalization.  Thus it happens that the importance of the land factor in history was  approached first from the philosophical side. Montesquieu and Herder had  no intention of solving sociological and geographical problems, when  they considered the relation of peoples and states to their soil; they  wished to understand the purpose and destiny of man as an inhabitant of  the earth.    [Sidenote: Theory of progress from the standpoint of geography.]    The study of history is always, from one standpoint, a study of  progress. Yet after all the century-long investigation of the history of  every people working out its destiny in its given environment,  struggling against the difficulties of its habitat, progressing when it  overcame them and retrograding when it failed, advancing when it made  the most of its opportunities and declining when it made less or  succumbed to an invader armed with better economic or political methods  to exploit the land, it is amazing how little the land, in which all  activities finally root, has been taken into account in the discussion  of progress. Nevertheless, for a theory of progress it offers a solid  basis. From the standpoint of the land social and political  organizations, in successive stages of development, embrace ever  increasing areas, and make them support ever denser populations; and in  this concentration of population and intensification of economic  development they assume ever higher forms. It does not suffice that a  people, in order to progress, should extend and multiply only its local  relations to its land. This would eventuate in arrested development,  such as Japan showed at the time of Perry's visit. The ideal basis of  progress is the expansion of the world relations of a people, the  extension of its field of activity and sphere of influence far beyond  the limits of its own territory, by which it exchanges commodities and  ideas with various countries of the world. Universal history shows us  that, as the geographical horizon of the known world has widened from  gray antiquity to the present, societies and states have expanded their  territorial and economic scope; that they have grown not only in the  number of their square miles and in the geographical range of their  international intercourse, but in national efficiency, power, and  permanence, and especially in that intellectual force which feeds upon  the nutritious food of wide comparisons. Every great movement which has  widened the geographical outlook of a people, such as the Crusades in  the Middle Ages, or the colonization of the Americas, has applied an  intellectual and economic stimulus. The expanding field of advancing  history has therefore been an essential concomitant and at the same time  a driving force in the progress of every people and of the world.    [Sidenote: Man's increasing dependence upon nature.]    Since progress in civilization involves an increasing exploitation of  natural advantages and the development of closer relations between a  land and its people, it is an erroneous idea that man tends to  emancipate himself more and more from the control of the natural  conditions forming at once the foundation and environment of his  activities. On the contrary, he multiplies his dependencies upon  nature;[124] but while increasing their sum total, he diminishes the  force of each. There lies the gist of the matter. As his bonds become  more numerous, they become also more elastic. Civilization has  lengthened his leash and padded his collar, so that it does not gall;  but the leash is never slipped. The Delaware Indians depended upon the  forests alone for fuel. A citizen of Pennsylvania, occupying the former  Delaware tract, has the choice of wood, hard or soft coal, coke,  petroleum, natural gas, or manufactured gas. Does this mean  emancipation? By no means. For while fuel was a necessity to the Indian  only for warmth and cooking, and incidentally for the pleasureable  excitement of burning an enemy at the stake, it enters into the  manufacture of almost every article that the Pennsylvanian uses in his  daily life. His dependence upon nature has become more far-reaching,  though less conspicuous and especially less arbitrary.    [Sidenote: Increase in kind and amount.]    These dependencies increase enormously both in variety and amount. Great  Britain, with its twenty thousand merchant ships aggregating over ten  million tons, and its immense import and export trade, finds its harbors  vastly more important to-day for the national welfare than in Cromwell's  time, when they were used by a scanty mercantile fleet. Since the  generation of electricity by water-power and its application to  industry, the plunging falls of the Scandinavian Mountains, of the Alps  of Switzerland, France, and Italy, of the Southern Appalachians and the  Cascade Range, are geographical features representing new and  unsuspected forms of national capital, and therefore new bonds between  land and people in these localities. Russia since 1844 has built 35,572  miles (57,374 kilometers) of railroad in her European territory, and  thereby derived a new benefit from her level plains, which so facilitate  the construction and cheap operation of railroads, that they have become  in this aspect alone a new feature in her national economy. On the other  hand, the galling restrictions of Russia's meager and strategically  confined coasts, which tie her hand in any wide maritime policy, work a  greater hardship to-day than they did a hundred years ago, since her  growing population creates a more insistent demand for international  trade. In contrast to Russia, Norway, with its paucity of arable soil  and of other natural resources, finds its long indented coastline and  the coast-bred seamanship of its people a progressively important  national asset. Hence as ocean-carriers the Norwegians have developed a  merchant marine nearly half as large again as that of Russia and Finland  combined--1,569,646 tons[125] as against 1,084,165 tons.    This growing dependence of a civilized people upon its land is  characterized by intelligence and self-help. Man forms a partnership  with nature, contributing brains and labor, while she provides the  capital or raw material in ever more abundant and varied forms. As a  result of this cooeperation, held by the terms of the contract, he  secures a better living than the savage who, like a mendicant, accepts  what nature is pleased to dole out, and lives under the tyranny of her  caprices.

He said to a regiment of  horse chasseurs at Lobenstein two days before the battle of Jena, \"My  lads! you must not fear death; when soldiers brave death, they drive  him into the enemy's ranks.\" On another occasion he said: \"You must  not fight too often with one enemy, or you teach him all your art of  war.\" This is a thrilling truth which always tells in war, and yet  behind all the apparent indifference to the great mysterious force  that holds sway over human affairs there was a hidden belief in the  power of the Deity to guide aright and give aid in the hour of need,  even to men of unequalled talents like Napoleon himself. His  spontaneous exclamations indicate that he did not doubt who created  and ruled the universe, but how much he relied on this power he never  really disclosed, and it can only be a supposition gathered from  utterances recorded by some of his contemporaries that he had a devout  belief in the great power of Christianity. \"Ah!\" said he one day,  \"there is but one means of getting good manners, and that is by  establishing religion.\" At that time the spiritual life of France was  at a low ebb, and the subject of religion was one of the most  unpopular and risky topics to raise, but Napoleon knew that it would  have to be tackled in the open sooner or later, and it is a matter of  authentic history that he struggled to bring and ultimately succeeded  in bringing back religious ordinances to France. He declared that no  good government could exist for long without it. His traducers  proclaimed him an atheist, and we hear the same claptrap from people  now who have not made themselves acquainted with the real history of  the man and his times. We do not say he was a saint, but he was a  better Christian, both in profession and action, than most of the  kings that ruled prior to and during his period. In every way he  excels the Louis of France, the Georges of Great Britain and Hanover,  the Fredericks of Prussia, and the Alexanders of Russia. The latter  two he puts far in the shade, both as a statesman, a warrior, and a  wise, humane ruler who saw far into futurity, and fought against the  reactionary forces of Europe, which combined to put an end to what was  called his ambition to dominate the whole of creation. He foretold  with amazing accuracy that from his ashes there would spring up  sectional wars for a time, and ultimately the selfsame elements of  vicious mediocrity that destroyed him would bring about a  world-conflict which would destroy itself.    The laws of life are simple, but at the same time very terrible in  their consequences if ignored or disobeyed. What folly to imagine that  any great figure or great tragedy comes into existence by chance!  Napoleon was just as necessary to the world as was Cromwell. Both had  the righting of wrongs and the clearing away of the accumulation of  centuries of chaos and misgovernment, and it was not to be expected  that they could carry out the necessary reforms without making the  authors of such an intolerable state of things angry and resentful at  their iron methods of discipline. Napoleon and Cromwell possessed the  combined arts of war and statesmanship to a higher degree than any of  their contemporaries. Cromwell excelled Napoleon in professional  Christianity. The latter never paraded his ideas of religion, though  he acted on them silently and gave occasional expression to the  thoughts of his soul. Indeed, he was too much given to publicly  disavowing the very principles he believed in privately. This plan or  habit was said to be for the purpose of creating controversy. Be that  as it may, when the natural spirit moved him he would declare his  views in the most robust way. On one of many occasions he startled the  Council of State by reminding them that a man did not risk being  killed for a few pence a day or for a paltry distinction. \"You must  speak to the soul,\" he declared, \"to electrify the man.\" Another very  notable expression is here worth referring to, as it instances how  practical and human were his views. \"The heart,\" said he, \"warms the  genius, but in Pitt the genius withers the heart, which is a very  different thing\"; and so it is that Cromwell and he were not  dissimilar in many of their attributes. Indeed, it is said that  Napoleon never tired of quoting or having quoted to him some striking  characteristic of Cromwell. We could hardly, with any degree of good  judgment, put Leslie the Covenanter or Sir Jacob Astley the Royalist,  or Nelson the matchless naval strategist and national hero, on a par  with either Cromwell or Napoleon. They are only here referred to in  connection with the two unequalled constructive statesmen and military  generals as representing a type of peculiarly religious men who have  occupied high military and naval positions in the service of the  State.    Hawkins, Drake, Frobisher, Blake in Cromwell's time, Nelson in  Napoleon's, were all fire-eating religious men, always asking favours  and guidance in their perilous undertakings from the great mystic  Power in whom they believed. Collingwood was a great admiral and a  Christian gentleman, who never mixed religion with hysterical or  dramatic flashes of quarterdeck language. He was ostentatious in  nothing, and seemed to observe a strictly decorous attitude. Nelson,  on the other hand, resembled a restless squirrel, always swift in his  instincts, with an enthusiasm which was contagious. In many ways he  did not adhere to what is called cricket in sporting phrase. He was  accustomed to say, \"Never mind the justice or the impudence of this or  that, only let me succeed.\" Then he would proceed to ask the Almighty  in feverish zeal to aid him in the object he had in view.    He would scatter a profusion of curses about in relation to the  treatment of the Admiralty towards himself, or at his disappointment  in not getting to grips with the French fleet, and then proceed to ask  Lady Hamilton if they had a nice church at Merton, so that they may  set an example of goodness to the under-parishioners, and \"admire the  pigs and poultry,\" etc. He finds on several occasions that a picture  of Emma is much admired by the French Consul at Barcelona, and feels  sure it would be admired by Bonaparte, and then he continues, \"I love  you most dearly, and hate the French most damnably.\" Sometimes he said  he hated the French as the devil hated holy water, which at that time  was considered to be the orthodoxy of a true Briton. It was quite a  pro-British attitude to patronize the maker of kings who had kept the  world in awe for nearly a quarter of a century, by expecting him to  admire a portrait of a loose woman to whom he referred in the most  scathing manner while at St. Helena. Her reputation and Nelson's  connection with her seems to have been known to him, as was also her  connection with the Neapolitan Court. His indictment was terrible.    Nelson had a weary, anxious time on the Toulon station. He called it  his home, and said they were in fine fighting trim and wished to God  the ships were the same, but they were in a very dilapidated  condition, not fit to stand the bad weather they were sure to  encounter. The British Minister at Naples wished to send a Frenchman  who could be relied on with information as to the whereabouts of the  French fleet. Nelson replied that he would not on any account have a  Frenchman in the British fleet except as a prisoner. He would be  grateful to him for any information he could give, but not a Frenchman  would be allowed to come to him, and adds that \"his mother hated the  French.\" He was enraged at the report spread by a fussy French Admiral  named M. la Touche-Treville, who was in command at Toulon. It was said  that he was sent to beat Nelson as he had done at Boulogne. But he was  shy about coming out and trying a tussle. Nelson said he was a  miscreant, a poltroon, and a liar. The Frenchman had boasted in a  publication that he had put the British fleet to flight. The British  Admiral took the charge so seriously to heart that he sent a copy of  the _Victory's_ log to the Admiralty to disprove the statement of the  lying Admiral la Touche, and in a letter to his brother Nelson says,  \"You will have seen La Touche's letter of how he chased me, and how I  ran. I keep it; and by God if I take him, he shall eat it.\" La Touche  cheated Nelson of a sweet revenge by dying like a good Christian  before the outraged British Admiral could get hold of him. The  newspapers of France said he died of fatigue caused by walking so  often to the signal post at Sepet, to watch the British fleet; and  Nelson stated \"that he was always sure that would be the death of him,  and that if he had come out to fight him it would have added ten years  on to his life.\" Poor Nelson was very sensitive when his professional  qualities were assailed. He thought, and thought rightly, that the  blockade at Toulon was an unparalleled feat of human patience and  physical endurance. He had only been out of his ship three times from  May 1803 to August 1805. We may write and speak about this wonderful  devotion to duty, but it is only if we take time to think of the  terrific things which the central figure who commanded, and the crews  of the fleet of rickety, worn-out, leaky baskets--proudly spoken of as  the \"wooden walls of Old England\"--had to contend with and actually  did, that we comprehend the vast strain and task of it all. It was  because Nelson was ever being reminded by some clumsy act of the  Admiralty or thoughtless, ignorant criticism on the part of the  politicians and civilian public generally that the work he and the men  under him were doing was not appreciated as it should be, that he gave  way to outbursts of violent resentment. But so far as the present  writer has been able to discover, his love of approbation was so  strong that "]]]
