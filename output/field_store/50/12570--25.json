[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1563"],[0,"The Crystal Stopper (#19)"],[1,"!... Yes, at once. The police are coming in a few minutes. No, no,  don't lose your head... You've got time. Only, do what I tell you. Is  your bag still packed?... Good. And is one of the sides empty, as I told  you?... Good. Well, go to my bedroom and stand with your face to the  chimney-piece. Press with your left hand on the little carved rosette in  front of the marble slab, in the middle, and with your right hand on the  top of the mantel-shelf. You'll see a sort of drawer, with two little  boxes in it. Be careful. One of them contains all our papers; the other,  bank-notes and jewellery. Put them both in the empty compartment of the  bag. Take the bag in your hand and go as fast as you can, on foot, to  the corner of the Avenue Victor-Hugo and the Avenue de Montespan. You'll  find the car waiting, with Victoire. I'll join you there... What?... My  clothes? My knickknacks?... Never mind about all that... You be off. See  you presently.\"    Lupin quietly pushed away the telephone. Then, taking Daubrecq by the  arm, he made him sit in a chair by his side and said:    \"And now listen to me, Daubrecq.\"    \"Oho!\" grinned the deputy. \"Calling each other by our surnames, are we?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"I allowed you to.\" And, when Daubrecq released his  arm with a certain misgiving, he said, \"No, don't be afraid. We sha'n't  come to blows. Neither of us has anything to gain by doing away with the  other. A stab with a knife? What's the good? No, sir! Words, nothing but  words. Words that strike home, though. Here are mine: they are plain and  to the point. Answer me in the same way, without reflecting: that's far  better. The boy?\"    \"I have him.\"    \"Give him back.\"    \"No.\"    \"Mme. Mergy will kill herself.\"    \"No, she won't.\"    \"I tell you she will.\"    \"And I tell you she will not.\"    \"But she's tried to, once.\"    \"That's just the reason why she won't try again.\"    \"Well, then...\"    \"No.\"    Lupin, after a moment, went on:    \"I expected that. Also, I thought, on my way here, that you would hardly  tumble to the story of Dr. Vernes and that I should have to use other  methods.\"    \"Lupin's methods.\"    \"As you say. I had made up my mind to throw off the mask. You pulled it  off for me. Well done you! But that doesn't change my plans.\"    \"Speak.\"    Lupin took from a pocketbook a double sheet of foolscap paper, unfolded  it and handed it to Daubrecq, saying:    \"Here is an exact, detailed inventory, with consecutive numbers, of the  things removed by my friends and myself from your Villa Marie-Therese on  the Lac d'Enghien. As you see, there are one hundred and thirteen items.  Of those one hundred and thirteen items, sixty-eight, which have a red  cross against them, have been sold and sent to America. The remainder,  numbering forty-five, are in my possession... until further orders. They  happen to be the pick of the bunch. I offer you them in return for the  immediate surrender of the child.\"    Daubrecq could not suppress a movement of surprise:    \"Oho!\" he said. \"You seem very much bent upon it.\"    \"Infinitely,\" said Lupin, \"for I am persuaded that a longer separation  from her son will mean death to Mme. Mergy.\"    \"And that upsets you, does it... Lothario?\"    \"What!\"    Lupin planted himself in front of the other and repeated:    \"What! What do you mean?\"    \"Nothing... Nothing... Something that crossed my mind... Clarisse Mergy  is a young woman still and a pretty woman at that.\"    Lupin shrugged his shoulders:    \"You brute!\" he mumbled. \"You imagine that everybody is like yourself,  heartless and pitiless. It takes your breath away, what, to think that a  shark like me can waste his time playing the Don Quixote? And you wonder  what dirty motive I can have? Don't try to find out: it's beyond your  powers of perception. Answer me, instead: do you accept?\"    \"So you're serious?\" asked Daubrecq, who seemed but little disturbed by  Lupin's contemptuous tone.    \"Absolutely. The forty-five pieces are in a shed, of which I will give  you the address, and they will be handed over to you, if you call there,  at nine o'clock this evening, with the child.\"    There was no doubt about Daubrecq's reply. To him, the kidnapping of  little Jacques had represented only a means of working upon Clarisse  Mergy's feelings and perhaps also a warning for her to cease the contest  upon which she had engaged. But the threat of a suicide must needs show  Daubrecq that he was on the wrong track. That being so, why refuse the  favourable bargain which Arsene Lupin was now offering him?    \"I accept,\" he said.    \"Here's the address of my shed: 99, Rue Charles-Lafitte, Neuilly. You  have only to ring the bell.\"    \"And suppose I send Prasville, the secretary-general, instead?\"    \"If you send Prasville,\" Lupin declared, \"the place is so arranged  that I shall see him coming and that I shall have time to escape, after  setting fire to the trusses of hay and straw which surround and conceal  your credence-tables, clocks and Gothic virgins.\"    \"But your shed will be burnt down...\"    \"I don't mind that: the police have their eye on it already. I am  leaving it in any case.\"    \"And how am I to know that this is not a trap?\"    \"Begin by receiving the goods and don't give up the child till  afterward. I trust you, you see.\"    \"Good,\" said Daubrecq; \"you've foreseen everything. Very well, you shall  have the nipper; the fair Clarisse shall live; and we will all be happy.  And now, if I may give you a word of advice, it is to pack off as fast  as you can.\"    \"Not yet.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"I said, not yet.\"    \"But you're mad! Prasville's on his way!\"    \"He can wait. I've not done.\"    \"Why, what more do you want? Clarisse shall have her brat. Isn't that  enough for you?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"There is another son.\"    \"Gilbert.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well?\"    \"I want you to save Gilbert.\"    \"What are you saying? I save Gilbert!\"    \"You can, if you like; it only means taking a little trouble.\" Until  that moment Daubrecq had remained quite calm. He now suddenly blazed out  and, striking the table with his fist:    \"No,\" he cried, \"not that! Never! Don't reckon on me!... No, that would  be too idiotic!\"    He walked up and down, in a state of intense excitement, with that queer  step of his, which swayed him from right to left on each of his legs,  like a wild beast, a heavy, clumsy bear. And, with a hoarse voice and  distorted features, he shouted:    \"Let her come here! Let her come and beg for her son's pardon! But let  her come unarmed, not with criminal intentions, like last time! Let  her come as a supplicant, as a tamed woman, as a submissive woman, who  understands and accepts the situation... Gilbert? Gilbert's sentence?  The scaffold? Why, that is where my strength lies! What! For more than  twenty years have I awaited my hour; and, when that hour strikes, when  fortune brings me this unhoped-for chance, when I am at last about to  know the joy of a full revenge--and such a revenge!--you think that I  will give it up, give up the thing which I have been pursuing for twenty  years? I save Gilbert? I? For nothing? For love? I, Daubrecq?... No, no,  you can't have studied my features!\"    He laughed, with a fierce and hateful laugh. Visibly, he saw before him,  within reach of his hand, the prey which he had been hunting down so  long. And Lupin also summoned up the vision of Clarisse, as he had seen  her several days before, fainting, already beaten, fatally conquered,  because all the hostile powers were in league against her.    He contained himself and said:    \"Listen to me.\"    And, when Daubrecq moved away impatiently, he took him by the two  shoulders, with that superhuman strength which Daubrecq knew, from  having felt it in the box at the Vaudeville, and, holding him motionless  in his grip, he said:    \"One last word.\"    \"You're wasting your breath,\" growled the deputy.    \"One last word. Listen, Daubrecq: forget Mme. Mergy, give up all the  nonsensical and imprudent acts which your pride and your passions are  making you commit; put all that on one side and think only of your  interest...\"    \"My interest,\" said Daubrecq, jestingly, \"always coincides with my pride  and with what you call my passions.\"    \"Up to the present, perhaps. But not now, not now that I have taken a  hand in the business. That constitutes a new factor, which you choose  to ignore. You are wrong. Gilbert is my pal. Gilbert is my chum. Gilbert  has to be saved from the scaffold. Use your influence to that end, and  I swear to you, do you hear, I swear that we will leave you in peace.  Gilbert's safety, that's all I ask. You will have no more battles to  wage with Mme. Mergy, with me; there will be no more traps laid for you.  You will be the master, free to act as you please. Gilbert's safety,  Daubrecq! If you refuse...\"    \"What then?\"    \"If you refuse, it will be war, relentless war; in other words, a  certain defeat for you.\"    \"Meaning thereby...\"    \"Meaning thereby that I shall take the list of the Twenty-seven from  you.\"    \"Rot! You think so, do you?\"    \"I swear it.\"    \"What Prasville and all his men, what Clarisse Mergy, what nobody has  been able to do, you think that you will do!\"    \"I shall!\"    \"And why? By favour of what saint will you succeed where everybody else  has failed? There must be a reason?\"    \"There is.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"My name is Arsene Lupin.\"    He had let go of Daubrecq, but held him for a time under the dominion  of his authoritative glance and will. At last, Daubrecq drew himself up,  gave him a couple of sharp taps on the shoulder and, with the same calm,  the same intense obstinacy, said:    \"And my name's Daubrecq. My whole life has been one desperate battle,  one long series of catastrophes and routs in which I spent all my  energies until victory came: complete, decisive, crushing, irrevocable  victory. I have against me the police, the government, France, the  world.

'None of thy scurrilous blusterings with me,' growled the gigantic  landlord, in the gentle semi-roar of an insulted tiger; 'my wine is good  enough for a carcass which shall so soon soak the dust of the  spoliarium.'    'Croakest thou thus, old raven!' returned the gladiator, laughing  scornfully; 'thou shalt live to hang thyself with despite when thou  seest me win the palm crown; and when I get the purse at the  amphitheatre, as I certainly shall, my first vow to Hercules shall be to  forswear thee and thy vile potations evermore.'    'Hear to him--hear to this modest Pyrgopolinices!  He has certainly  served under Bombochides Cluninstaridysarchides,' cried the host.  'Sporus, Niger, Tetraides, he declares he shall win the purse from you.  Why, by the gods! each of your muscles is strong enough to stifle all  his body, or I know nothing of the arena!'    'Ha!' said the gladiator, coloring with rising fury, 'our lanista would  tell a different story.'    'What story could he tell against me, vain Lydon?' said Tetraides,  frowning.    'Or me, who have conquered in fifteen fights?' said the gigantic Niger,  stalking up to the gladiator.    'Or me?' grunted Sporus, with eyes of fire.    'Tush!' said Lydon, folding his arms, and regarding his rivals with a  reckless air of defiance.  'The time of trial will soon come; keep your  valor till then.'    'Ay, do,' said the surly host; 'and if I press down my thumb to save  you, may the Fates cut my thread!'    'Your rope, you mean,' said Lydon, sneeringly: 'here is a sesterce to  buy one.'    The Titan wine-vender seized the hand extended to him, and griped it in  so stern a vice that the blood spirted from the fingers' ends over the  garments of the bystanders.    They set up a savage laugh.    'I will teach thee, young braggart, to play the Macedonian with me!  I  am no puny Persian, I warrant thee!  What, man!  have I not fought  twenty years in the ring, and never lowered my arms once?  And have I  not received the rod from the editor's own hand as a sign of victory,  and as a grace to retirement on my laurels?  And am I now to be lectured  by a boy?' So saying, he flung the hand from him in scorn.    Without changing a muscle, but with the same smiling face with which he  had previously taunted mine host, did the gladiator brave the painful  grasp he had undergone.  But no sooner was his hand released, than,  crouching for one moment as a wild cat crouches, you might see his hair  bristle on his head and beard, and with a fierce and shrill yell he  sprang on the throat of the giant, with an impetus that threw him, vast  and sturdy as he was, from his balance--and down, with the crash of a  falling rock, he fell--while over him fell also his ferocious foe.    Our host, perhaps, had had no need of the rope so kindly recommended to  him by Lydon, had he remained three minutes longer in that position.  But, summoned to his assistance by the noise of his fall, a woman, who  had hitherto kept in an inner apartment, rushed to the scene of battle.  This new ally was in herself a match for the gladiator; she was tall,  lean, and with arms that could give other than soft embraces.  In fact,  the gentle helpmate of Burbo the wine-seller had, like himself, fought  in the lists--nay under the emperor's eye.  And Burbo himself--Burbo,  the unconquered in the field, according to report, now and then yielded  the palm to his soft Stratonice.  This sweet creature no sooner saw the  imminent peril that awaited her worse half, than without other weapons  than those with which Nature had provided her, she darted upon the  incumbent gladiator, and, clasping him round the waist with her long and  snakelike arms, lifted him by a sudden wrench from the body of her  husband, leaving only his hands still clinging to the throat of his foe.  So have we seen a dog snatched by the hind legs from the strife with a  fallen rival in the arms of some envious groom; so have we seen one half  of him high in air--passive and offenceless--while the other half, head,  teeth, eyes, claws, seemed buried and engulfed in the mangled and  prostrate enemy.  Meanwhile, the gladiators, lapped, and pampered, and  glutted upon blood, crowded delightedly round the combatants--their  nostrils distended--their lips grinning--their eyes gloatingly fixed on  the bloody throat of the one and the indented talons of the other.    'Habet! (he has got it!) habet!' cried they, with a sort of yell,  rubbing their nervous hands.    'Non habeo, ye liars; I have not got it!' shouted the host, as with a  mighty effort he wrenched himself from those deadly hands, and rose to  his feet, breathless, panting, lacerated, bloody; and fronting, with  reeling eyes, the glaring look and grinning teeth of his baffled foe,  now struggling (but struggling with disdain) in the gripe of the sturdy  amazon.    'Fair play!' cried the gladiators: 'one to one'; and, crowding round  Lydon and the woman, they separated our pleasing host from his courteous  guest.    But Lydon, feeling ashamed at his present position, and endeavoring in  vain to shake off the grasp of the virago, slipped his hand into his  girdle, and drew forth a short knife.  So menacing was his look, so  brightly gleamed the blade, that Stratonice, who was used only to that  fashion of battle which we moderns call the pugilistic, started back in  alarm.    'O gods!' cried she, 'the ruffian!--he has concealed weapons!  Is that  fair? Is that like a gentleman and a gladiator?  No, indeed, I scorn  such fellows.' With that she contemptuously turned her back on the  gladiator, and hastened to examine the condition of her husband.    But he, as much inured to the constitutional exercises as an English  bull-dog is to a contest with a more gentle antagonist, had already  recovered himself.  The purple hues receded from the crimson surface of  his cheek, the veins of the forehead retired into their wonted size.  He  shook himself with a complacent grunt, satisfied that he was still  alive, and then looking at his foe from head to foot with an air of more  approbation than he had ever bestowed upon him before:    'By Castor!' said he, 'thou art a stronger fellow than I took thee for!  I see thou art a man of merit and virtue; give me thy hand, my hero!'    'Jolly old Burbo!' cried the gladiators, applauding, 'staunch to the  backbone.  Give him thy hand, Lydon.'    'Oh, to be sure,' said the gladiator: 'but now I have tasted his blood,  I long to lap the whole.'    'By Hercules!' returned the host, quite unmoved, 'that is the true  gladiator feeling.  Pollux! to think what good training may make a man;  why, a beast could not be fiercer!'    'A beast!  O dullard! we beat the beasts hollow!' cried Tetraides.    'Well, well,' said Stratonice, who was now employed in smoothing her hair  and adjusting her dress, 'if ye are all good friends again, I recommend  you to be quiet and orderly; for some young noblemen, your patrons and  backers, have sent to say they will come here to pay you a visit: they  wish to see you more at their ease than at the schools, before they make  up their bets on the great fight at the amphitheatre. So they always  come to my house for that purpose: they know we only receive the best  gladiators in Pompeii--our society is very select--praised be the gods!'    'Yes,' continued Burbo, drinking off a bowl, or rather a pail of wine,  'a man who has won my laurels can only encourage the brave. Lydon,  drink, my boy; may you have an honorable old age like mine!'    'Come here,' said Stratonice, drawing her husband to her affectionately  by the ears, in that caress which Tibullus has so prettily  described--'Come here!'    'Not so hard, she-wolf! thou art worse than the gladiator,' murmured the  huge jaws of Burbo.    'Hist!' said she, whispering him; 'Calenus has just stole in, disguised,  by the back way.  I hope he has brought the sesterces.'    'Ho! ho! I will join him,' said Burbo; 'meanwhile, I say, keep a sharp  eye on the cups--attend to the score.  Let them not cheat thee, wife;  they are heroes, to be sure, but then they are arrant rogues: Cacus was  nothing to them.'    'Never fear me, fool!' was the conjugal reply; and Burbo, satisfied with  the dear assurance, strode through the apartment, and sought the  penetralia of his house.    'So those soft patrons are coming to look at our muscles,' said Niger.  'Who sent to previse thee of it, my mistress?'    'Lepidus.  He brings with him Clodius, the surest better in Pompeii, and  the young Greek, Glaucus.'    'A wager on a wager,' cried Tetraides; 'Clodius bets on me, for twenty  sesterces!  What say you, Lydon?'    'He bets on me!' said Lydon.    'No, on me!' grunted Sporus.    'Dolts! do you think he would prefer any of you to Niger?' said the  athletic, thus modestly naming himself.    'Well, well,' said Stratonice, as she pierced a huge amphora for her  guests, who had now seated themselves before one of the tables, 'great  men and brave, as ye all think yourselves, which of you will fight the  Numidian lion in case no malefactor should be found to deprive you of  the option?'    'I who have escaped your arms, stout Stratonice,' said Lydon, 'might  safely, I think, encounter the lion.'    'But tell me,' said Tetraides, 'where is that pretty young slave of  yours--the blind girl, with bright eyes?  I have not seen her a long  time.'    'Oh! she is too delicate for you, my son of Neptune,' said the hostess,  'and too nice even for us, I think.  We send her into the town to sell  flowers and sing to the ladies: she makes us more money so than she  would by waiting on you.  Besides, she has often other employments which  lie under the rose.'    'Other employments!' said Niger; 'why, she is too young for them.'    'Silence, beast!' said Stratonice; 'you think there is no play but the  Corinthian.  If Nydia were twice the age she is at present, she would be"]]]
