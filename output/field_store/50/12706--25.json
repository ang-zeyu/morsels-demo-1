[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#19)"],[1,"  if you can suborn a friendly waiter he could help you considerably.  Excellent oysters and smoked salmon are to be had here, but the place is  apt to be rather crowded and noisy. The appointments are of the simplest  and most unpretentious kind. Prices, moderately high--about two-thirds  of the Englischer Garten. Set meals are served, but _a la carte_ is more  usual. The waiters, being institutions like most of the guests, are  inclined to be a little off-hand and familiar, and there is altogether a  free and easy and homely tone about the place, but it is perfectly  respectable.    Neues Palais de Saxe, on the Neumarket, is owned and managed by Herr  Muller. Very fair cuisine; good set meals; _a la carte_ rather more  expensive; speciality made of oysters and _ecrevisses_, which latter are  served in all sorts of fascinating ways. Not at all a bad place for  supper after the theatre, but perhaps a trifle dull.    Kneist, in a little street off the Altmarkt, called, I think, the Grosse  Brudergasse, is managed by the proprietor whose name it bears. This may  perhaps be called the leading beer restaurant of Dresden; it is  remarkably popular and considered very good. Worth a visit as a typical  though favourable specimen of its kind. Much frequented by officers and  officials; here you find good plain fare served in the simplest of  fashions. Meals _a la carte_ and quite inexpensive; cuisine purely  German, homely and wholesome, with excellent beer, especially Erlanger.  The atmosphere is usually hot, thick, and stuffy, but the _clientele_  does not seem to mind it.    In a little back room the principal dignitaries of the Saxon Court,  State, and Army are wont to forgather every morning for their  Fruehschoppen,--a kind of early, largely liquid lunch, where, if rumour  can be trusted, a good deal of important business is informally  discussed and settled.    The Kaiser Palast, on the Pirnaischerplatz, is a huge but not  particularly attractive establishment with wine and beer departments.    The best Pilsen beer in Dresden is obtainable at the Bierstall in a  little street off the Altmarkt, in a somewhat disreputable quarter of  the town; it is not a suitable place for ladies, but is quite  respectable for men. The beer is well worth sampling, but the air is not  fit to breathe.    Good Munich beer is to be had at the Zacherlbrau in the Koenig Johann  Strasse.    As regards dining at hotels.    The Savoy (Sedanstrasse), the Europaischen Hof (Pragerstrasse), and the  Bellevue (Theaterplatz) rank about equal. The set meals are of the usual  hotel type; the _a la carte_ prices are, of course, high. The preference  of the English is generally given to the Savoy, but the Europaischer Hof  is the most popular with German society. The Bellevue is very pleasant  in the summer, having a large verandah with a lovely view overlooking  the Elbe, where one can dine in the hot weather.      Munich    There are no absolutely first-class restaurants in Munich, although the  Hotel de Russie is certainly the best and now boasts of a capital  _chef_. It is under the same directorate as the Vierjahrzeiten, but  being a better class of establishment, with more modern appointments, it  has eclipsed the latter. It is now a case of the Vierjahrzeiten's nose  being put out of joint by its own child. Yet the latter, though rather  old-fashioned, is still very comfortable and has an American bar.    Schleich's Restaurant is very good, as is also the Continental, on the  Maximiliens Platz, and the Hungaerische Hof.    You should visit the Hofbrauhaus in the Platz, if only to drink as good  a glass of beer as one could wish to have. It is a fine and typical  specimen of a German Bierhalle, very respectable and much frequented.  After having had your first Schoppen (for having once tasted you  invariably want more) you rinse out your glass at a handy fountain  before presenting it to be refilled; but the person who takes your  Schoppen along with several others in each hand, invariably with  unerring instinct hands you back your same Schoppen. As an appetizer for  the beer to which it is supposed to give an additional zest, they place  a large radish about the size of an apple in a sort of turnip-cutting  machine which ejects it in thin rings; it is then washed and put into a  saucer with a little salt and water and eaten without any other  accompaniment than the beer; it may be an acquired taste, but it appears  to be very popular.      Nueremberg    Nueremberg being essentially a commercial and industrial town, it follows  that expensive restaurants and high living are not one of the features  of it. Yet the Bierkellers there are institutions that have existed  since the time of Albert Duerer and his companions.    Among the best of these is the Rathhauskeller (or town-hall cellar),  kept by Carl Giessing, a most picturesque place, as indeed is everything  in Nueremberg; also the Fottinger in the Koenigstrasse and the  Herrenkeller in the Theaterstrasse. At all of these good meals can be  obtained at moderate prices, and hock is the best wine to order.    Perhaps the most interesting place in this storehouse of beautiful  antiquities is the hostelry known as the Bratwurstgloecklein, or Little  Bell of the Roast Sausage; here the specialities are excellent beer and  the very best of diminutive sausages made fresh every day, also  Sauerkraut. The bell is still suspended on the end wall by an  ornamental, hammered iron bracket. Built about the year 1400, it is one  of the most ancient, if not the oldest, refreshment house in the world,  and has been used as such ever since. Here did the Meistersingers  forgather, Hans Sachs, Peter Vischer, Albrecht Duerer, Wellebald  Pirkheimer, Veit Stoss and other celebrated men in Nueremberg's history  in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Great historical interest has  always attached to this house, where the best class of entertainment is  to be had. The present owners profess to have many of the original  drinking-mugs, cans, etc., that these old customers habitually used and  which were individually reserved for them. The proprietors of the  Bratwurstgloecklein are so particular with regard to the character of  their sausages that they are made twice a day. Consequently the sausage  they give you in the evening has not even been made that morning; it  dates its construction only from mid-day.    There is a doggerel rhyme written of the establishment that runs very  much in the same strain in which I have translated it:--        Not many noble strangers      Can possibly refrain,      When once they've ate our sausages      From eating them again.      And it usually strikes them,      If they have not yet found it out,      That these sausages are splendid      When they're mixed with Sauerkraut.      The only thing they rail at,      When they fain would criticise,      Is to wish the little sausage      Were a little larger size.    At the principal hotels, such as the Grand, Strauss, Wuerttemberger Hof,  and Victoria, very good meals can be procured--the mid-day  _table-d'hote_ prices varying from 3s. to 3s. 6d. Perhaps the best of  these is the Victoria, which rejoices in a grill-room, and where the  delicacies of the season are available.    There are American bars at the \"American Bar,\" Karolinenstrasse, the  Hotel Strauss, same street, and at the Wittelsbacker Hof in the  Pfaunenschmiedsgasse.    The cafes are the Bristol in the Josephs Platz, the Central in the  Karolinenstrasse, the Habsburg and the Imperial both in the  Koenigstrasse; but do not go to any of these under the idea that they  represent the Cafe Anglais in Paris.    A very pleasant resort in the summer is the Maxfeld Restauration in the  Stadt Park. It is in the open air, and an excellent band plays at 5 P.M.  on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. A fair dinner is provided, but it  is better to order in advance by telephone.      Hanover    The Georgshalle is, and has been for the last forty years, the best cafe  and restaurant in Hanover, but is now incorporated with Kasten's Hotel.  It was the usual and, for many years, the only place of resort where a  simple and decent meal could be obtained. I am not talking of the _haute  cuisine_, because it does not exist in this city.    Kasten's Hotel is good of its kind. The Kaiser has dined there on his  occasional visits to the town. Private balls and other entertainments  are given there, and the wines are generally good.    The Tip Top Restaurant, in the Karmarschstrasse, is a comparatively  modern, pleasant, and cheery _locale_, with a good bill of fare. On  account of its proximity to the theatre it is much frequented for  suppers after the play.    There are several Biergaerten open in the summer where military and other  bands perform, but nothing but ordinary refreshment is to be obtained  here.      Leipzig    Leipzig has one good restaurant, the Restaurant Paege on the  Marktplatz,--at least it is the best in the town.    The Hotel Hauffe, in the Russplatz, is an old-established hotel, is well  conducted, and has a restaurant where one can get quite a decent dinner  if ordered beforehand.    There is also another, Friedrichkrause, Katharinensbresse, No. 6, but  with these three the culinary capabilities of Leipzig are practically at  an end. Of course there are a number of Bierhalle and Kellern to  accommodate the students and music pupils, for which latter Leipzig is  the home of instruction.      Frankfurt-am-Main    Frankfurt gives me the idea of having more wealthy people in it than any  other town I know, and I do not think I am very far wrong in this. The  Central Railway Station is the finest one can imagine.    It has at least four first-class restaurants attached to hotels.    The Hotel d'Angleterre, or Englischer Hof, in the centre of the city,  the Rossmarkt, is a fine old hotel. Our present king, when Prince of  Wales, generally stayed there when passing "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#19)"],[1," sufferings would put an end to our adventures--and  our lives! But it was utterly useless to discuss the matter with my  uncle. He would have answered by some axiom from Plato.    During the whole of next day we proceeded on our journey through this  interminable gallery, arch after arch, tunnel after tunnel. We journeyed  without exchanging a word. We had become as mute and reticent as Hans,  our guide.    The road had no longer an upward tendency; at all events, if it had, it  was not to be made out very clearly. Sometimes there could be no doubt  that we were going downwards. But this inclination was scarcely to be  distinguished, and was by no means reassuring to the Professor, because  the character of the strata was in no wise modified, and the transition  character of the rocks became more and more marked.    It was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the  sparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks, and the old red  sandstone. One might have fancied oneself in one of those deep cuttings  in Devonshire, which have given their name to this kind of soil. Some  magnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery:  some of an agate grey with white veins of variegated character, others  of a yellow spotted color, with red veins; farther off might be seen  samples of color in which cherry-tinted seams were to be found in all  their brightest shades.    The greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of  primitive animals. Since the previous evening, nature and creation had  made considerable progress. Instead of the rudimentary trilobites, I  perceived the remains of a more perfect order. Among others, the fish in  which the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of  the reptile.    The Devonian seas were inhabited by a vast number of animals of this  species, which were deposited in tens of thousands in the rocks of new  formation.    It was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal  life of which man forms the summit. My excellent uncle, the Professor,  appeared not to take notice of these warnings. He was determined at any  risk to proceed.    He must have been in expectation of one of two things; either that a  vertical well was about to open under his feet, and thus allow him to  continue his descent, or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel  us to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled. But evening  came again, and, to my horror, neither hope was doomed to be realized!    On Friday, after a night when I began to feel the gnawing agony of  thirst, and when in consequence appetite decreased, our little band rose  and once more followed the turnings and windings, the ascents and  descents, of this interminable gallery. All were silent and gloomy. I  could see that even my uncle had ventured too far.    After about ten hours of further progress--a progress dull and  monotonous to the last degree--I remarked that the reverberation, and  reflection of our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel, had singularly  diminished. The marble, the schist, the calcareous rocks, the red  sandstone, had disappeared, leaving in their places a dark and gloomy  wall, somber and without brightness. When we reached a remarkably narrow  part of the tunnel, I leaned my left hand against the rock.    When I took my hand away, and happened to glance at it, it was quite  black. We had reached the coal strata of the Central Earth.    \"A coal mine!\" I cried.    \"A coal mine without miners,\" responded my uncle, a little severely.    \"How can we tell?\"    \"I can tell,\" replied my uncle, in a sharp and doctorial tone. \"I am  perfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal  was not cut by the hand of man. But whether it is the work of nature or  not is of little concern to us. The hour for our evening meal has  come--let us sup.\"    Hans, the guide, occupied himself in preparing food. I had come to that  point when I could no longer eat. All I cared about were the few drops  of water which fell to my share. What I suffered it is useless to  record. The guide's gourd, not quite half full, was all that was left  for us three!    Having finished their repast, my two companions laid themselves down  upon their rugs, and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and  sufferings. As for me, I could not sleep, I lay counting the hours until  morning.    The next morning, Saturday, at six o'clock, we started again. Twenty  minutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation. From its mighty  extent I saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do  with this coal mine; the vault above would have fallen in; as it was, it  was only held together by some miracle of nature.    This mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide, by about a  hundred and fifty high. The earth had evidently been cast apart by some  violent subterranean commotion. The mass, giving way to some prodigious  upheaving of nature, had split in two, leaving the vast gap into which  we inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time.    The whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark  and gloomy walls. A geologist would have been able easily to follow the  different phases of its formation. The seams of coal were separated by  strata of sandstone, a compact clay, which appeared to be crushed down  by the weight from above.    At that period of the world which preceded the secondary epoch, the  earth was covered by a coating of enormous and rich vegetation, due to  the double action of tropical heat and perpetual humidity. A vast  atmospheric cloud of vapor surrounded the earth on all sides, preventing  the rays of the sun from ever reaching it.    Hence the conclusion that these intense heats did not arise from this  new source of caloric.    Perhaps even the star of day was not quite ready for its brilliant  work--to illumine a universe. Climates did not as yet exist, and a level  heat pervaded the whole surface of the globe--the same heat existing at  the North Pole as at the equator.    Whence did it come? From the interior of the earth?    In spite of all the learned theories of Professor Hardwigg, a fierce and  vehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great  spheroid. Its action was felt even to the very topmost crust of the  earth; the plants then in existence, being deprived of the vivifying  rays of the sun, had neither buds, nor flowers, nor odor, but their  roots drew a strong and vigorous life from the burning earth of early  days.    There were but few of what may be called trees--only herbaceous plants,  immense turfs, briers, mosses, rare families, which, however, in those  days were counted by tens and tens of thousands.    It is entirely to this exuberant vegetation that coal owes its origin.  The crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the  seething, boiling mass, which was forever at work beneath. Hence arose  numerous fissures, and continual falling in of the upper earth. The  dense mass of plants being beneath the waters, soon formed themselves  into vast agglomerations.    Then came about the action of natural chemistry; in the depths of the  ocean the vegetable mass at first became turf, then, thanks to the  influence of gases and subterranean fermentation, they underwent the  complete process of mineralization.    In this manner, in early days, were formed those vast and prodigious  layers of coal, which an ever--increasing consumption must utterly use  up in about three centuries more, if people do not find some more  economic light than gas, and some cheaper motive power than steam.    All these reflections, the memories of my school studies, came to my  mind while I gazed upon these mighty accumulations of coal, whose  riches, however, are scarcely likely to be ever utilized. The working of  these mines could only be carried out at an expense that would never  yield a profit.    The matter, however, is scarcely worthy consideration, when coal is  scattered over the whole surface of the globe, within a few yards of the  upper crust. As I looked at these untouched strata, therefore, I knew  they would remain as long as the world lasts.    While we still continued our journey, I alone forgot the length of the  road, by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations. The  temperature continued to be very much the same as while we were  traveling amid the lava and the schists. On the other hand my sense of  smell was much affected by a very powerful odor. I immediately knew that  the gallery was filled to overflowing with that dangerous gas the miners  call fire damp, the explosion of which has caused such fearful and  terrible accidents, making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a  single hour.    Happily, we were able to illumine our progress by means of the Ruhmkorff  apparatus. If we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this  gallery, torch in hand, a terrible explosion would have put an end to  our travels, simply because no travelers would be left.    Our excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the  earth lasted until evening. My uncle was scarcely able to conceal his  impatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance  in a horizontal direction.    The darkness, dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear,  rendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery.  For myself, I began to believe that it was simply interminable, and  would go on in the same manner for months.    Suddenly, at six o'clock, we stood in front of a wall. To the right, to  the left above, below, nowhere was there any passage. We had reached a  spot where the rocks said in unmistakable accents--No Thoroughfare.    I stood stupefied. The guide simply folded his arms. My uncle was  silent.    \"Well, well, so much the better,\" cried my uncle, at "]]]
