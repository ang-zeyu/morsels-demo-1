Let them turn aside for a moment from the nebulae in the sky to the  conclusions to which philosophers had been irresistibly led by a  consideration of the features of the solar system. We had before us in  the sun and planets obviously not a haphazard aggregation of bodies,  but a system resting upon a multitude of relations pointing to a  common physical cause. From these considerations Kant and Laplace  formulated the nebular hypothesis, resting it on gravitation alone,  for at that time the science of the conservation of energy was  practically unknown. These philosophers showed how, on the supposition  that the space now occupied by the solar system was once filled by a  vaporous mass, the formation of the sun and planets could be  reasonably accounted for. By a totally different method of reasoning,  modern science traced the solar system backward step by step to a  similar state of things at the beginning. According to Helmholtz, the  sun's heat was maintained by the contraction of his mass, at the rate  of about 220 feet a year. Whether at the present time the sun was  getting hotter or colder we did not certainly know. We could reason  back to the time when the sun was sufficiently expanded to fill the  whole space occupied by the solar system, and was reduced to a great  glowing nebula. Though man's life, the life of the race perhaps, was  too short to give us direct evidence of any distinct stages of so  august a process, still the probability was great that the nebular  hypothesis, especially in the more precise form given to it by Roche,  did represent broadly, notwithstanding some difficulties, the  succession of events through which the sun and planets had passed.    [Illustration: DR. WILLIAM HUGGINS, D.C.L., LL.D., PRESIDENT OF THE  BRITISH ASSOCIATION.    Dr. Huggins is one of the most eminent astronomers of the present day,  and his spectroscopic researches on the celestial bodies have had the  most important results. He is a D.C.L. of Oxford, LL.D. of Cambridge,  and Ph.D of Leyden. Dr. Huggins was born in 1824 and educated at the  City of London School. He continued his studies, giving much of his  time to experiments in natural philosophy and physical science. In  1855 Dr. Huggins erected a private observatory at his residence on  Tulse Hill, where he has carried out valuable prismatic researches  with the spectroscope.--_Daily Graphic._]      OTHER SPECULATIONS.    The nebular hypothesis of Laplace required a rotating mass of fluid  which at successive epochs became unstable from excess of motion, and  left behind rings, or more probably, perhaps, lumps, of matter from  the equatorial regions. To some thinkers was suggested a different  view of things, according to which it was not necessary to suppose  that one part of the system gravitationally supported another. The  whole might consist of a congeries of discrete bodies, even if these  bodies were the ultimate molecules of matter. The planets might have  been formed by the gradual accretion of such discrete bodies. On the  view that the material of the condensing solar system consisted of  separate particles or masses, we had no longer the fluid pressure  which was an essential part of Laplace's theory. Faye, in his theory  of evolution from meteorites, had to throw over his fundamental idea  of the nebular hypothesis, and formulated instead a different  succession of events of which the outer planets were formed last, a  theory which had difficulties of its own. Professor George Darwin had  recently shown, from an investigation of the mechanical conditions of  a swarm of meteorites, that on certain assumptions a meteoric swarm  might behave as a coarse gas, and in this way bring back the fluid  pressure exercised by one part of the system on the other, which was  required by Laplace's theory. One chief assumption consisted in  supposing that such inelastic bodies as meteoric stones might attain  the effective elasticity of a high order which was necessary to the  theory through the sudden volatilization of a part of their mass at an  encounter, by which what was virtually a violent explosive was  introduced between the two colliding stones. Professor Darwin was  careful to point out that it must necessarily be obscure as to how a  small mass of solid matter could take up a very large amount of energy  in a small fraction of a second.      HELMHOLTZ'S DISCOVERY.    The old view of the original matter of the nebulae, that it consisted  of a \"fiery mist,\"                \"a tumultuous cloud,        Instinct with fire and niter,\"    fell at once with the rise of the science of thermodynamics. In 1854,  Helmholtz showed that the supposition of an original fiery condition  of the nebulous stuff was unnecessary, since in the mutual gravitation  of widely separated matter we had a store of potential energy  sufficient to generate the high temperature of the sun and stars. We  could scarcely go wrong in attributing the light of the nebulae to the  conversion of the gravitational energy of shrinkage into molecular  motion. The inquisitiveness of the human mind did not allow us to  remain content with the interpretation of the present state of the  cosmical masses, but suggested the question--                         What see'st thou else        In the dark backward and abysm of time?    What was the original state of things? How had it come about that by  the side of ageing worlds we had nebulae in a relatively younger stage?  Had any of them received their birth from dark suns, which had  collided into new life, and so belonged to a second or later  generation of the heavenly bodies?      LOOKING BACKWARD.    During the short historic period there was no record of such an event;  still it would seem to be only through the collision of dark suns, of  which the number must be increasing, that a temporary rejuvenescence  of the heavens was possible, and by such ebbings and flowings of  stellar life that the inevitable end to which evolution in its  apparently uncompensated progress was carrying us could, even for a  little, be delayed. We could not refuse to admit as possible such an  origin for nebulae. In considering, however, the formation of the  existing nebulae we must bear in mind that, in the part of the heavens  within our ken, the stars still in the early and middle stages of  evolution exceeded greatly in number those which appeared to be in an  advanced condition of condensation. Indeed, we found some stars which  might be regarded as not far advanced beyond the nebular condition. It  might be that the cosmical bodies which were still nebulous owed their  later development to some conditions of the part of space where they  occurred, such as conceivably a greater original homogeneity, in  consequence of which condensation began less early. In other parts of  space condensation might have been still further delayed, or even have  not yet begun. If light matter were suggested by the spectrum of these  nebulae, it might be asked further, as a pure speculation, whether in  them we were witnessing possibly a later condensation of the light  matter which had been left behind, at least in a relatively greater  proportion, after the first growth of worlds into which the heavier  matter condensed, though not without some entanglement of the lighter  substances. The wide extent and great diffuseness of this bright-line  nebulosity over a large part of the constellation of Orion might be  regarded, perhaps, as pointing in this direction. The diffuse nebulous  matter streaming round the Pleiades might possibly be another  instance, though the character of its spectrum had not yet been  ascertained.      THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS.    Besides its more direct use in the chemical analysis of the heavenly  bodies, the spectroscope had given to us a great and unexpected power  of advance along the lines of the older astronomy. In the future a  higher value might, indeed, be placed upon this indirect use of the  spectroscope than upon its chemical revelations. By no direct  astronomical methods could motions of approach or of recession of the  stars be even detected, much less could they be measured. A body  coming directly toward us or going directly from us appeared to stand  still. In the case of the stars we could receive no assistance from  change of size or of brightness. The stars showed no true disks in our  instruments, and the nearest of them was so far off that if it were  approaching us at the rate of a hundred miles in a second of time, a  whole century of such rapid approach would not do more than increase  its brightness by the one-fortieth part. Still it was formerly only  too clear that, so long as we were unable to ascertain directly those  components of the stars' motions which lay in the line of sight, the  speed and direction of the solar motion in space, and many of the  great problems of the constitution of the heavens must have remained  more or less imperfectly known. Now the spectroscope had placed in our  hands this power, which, though so essential, had previously appeared  almost in the nature of things to lie forever beyond our grasp; it  enabled us to measure directly, and, under favorable circumstances, to  within a mile per second, or even less, the speed of approach or of  recession of a heavenly body. This method of observation had the great  advantage for the astronomer of being independent of the distance of  the moving body, and was, therefore, as applicable and as certain in  the case"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#19)"],[1," but, as politicians and statesmen, they had to labour with  instruments which soiled their hands in touching them. In purity, in  uprightness, in courage, truth and stainless honour, the Regent and  Latimer were perhaps his equals; but Murray was intellectually far  below him and the sphere of Latimer's influence was on a smaller  scale. The time has come when English history may do justice to one  but for whom the Reformation would have been overthrown among  ourselves; for the spirit which Knox created saved Scotland; and if  Scotland had been Catholic again, neither the wisdom of Elizabeth's  Ministers, nor the teaching of her Bishops, nor her own chicaneries,  would have preserved England from revolution. His was the voice that  taught the peasant of the Lothians that he was a free man, the equal  in the sight of God with the proudest peer or prelate that had  trampled on his forefathers. He was the one antagonist whom Mary  Stuart could not soften nor Maitland deceive. He it was who had  raised the poor commons of his country into a stern and rugged  people, who might be hard, narrow, superstitious and fanatical, but  who nevertheless were men whom neither king, noble, nor priest could  force again to submit to tyranny. And his reward has been the  ingratitude of those who should have done most honour to his  memory.\"    The spirit of this fine passage may be due to the great Scotsman  with whom Froude's name will always be inseparably associated. But  Froude knew the subject as Carlyle did not pretend to know it, and  his verdict is as authoritative as it is just. It is knowledge, even  more than brilliancy, that these twelve volumes evince. Froude had  mastered the sixteenth century as Macaulay mastered the seventeenth,  with the same minute, patient industry. When he came to write he  wrote with such apparent facility that those who did not know the  meaning of historical research thought him shallow and superficial.    The period during which Froude was studying the reign of Elizabeth  must be pronounced the happiest of his life. He was a born  historian, and loved research. He had opportunities of acquiring  knowledge opened to no one before, and it concerned those events  which above all others attracted him. His second wife was the most  sympathetic of companions, thoroughly understanding all his moods.  She was fond of society, and induced him to frequent it. Froude was  disinclined to go out in the evening, and would, if he had been left  to himself, have stayed at home. He wrote to Lady Salisbury: \"I must  trust to your kindness to make allowance for my old-fashioned ways.  I am so much engaged in the week that I give my Sunday evenings to  my children, and never go out.\" But when he was in company he talked  better than almost any one else, and he had a magnetic power of  fascination which men as well as women often found quite  irresistible. Living in London, he saw people of all sorts, and the  puritan sternness which lay at the root of his character was  concealed by the cynical humour which gave zest to his conversation.  He had not forgotten his native county, and in 1863 he took a house  at Salcombe on the southern coast of Devonshire. Ringrone, which he  rented from Lord Kingsale, is a beautiful spot, now a hotel, then  remote from railways, and an ideal refuge for a student. \"We have a  sea like the Mediterranean,\" he tells Skelton, \"and estuaries  beautiful as Loch Fyne, the green water washing our garden wall, and  boats and mackerel.\" Froude worked there, however, besides yachting,  fishing, and shooting.    In 1864, for instance, he \"floundered all the summer among the  extinct mine-shafts of Scotch politics--the most damnable set of  pitfalls mortal man was ever set to blunder through in the dark.\"  His study opened on the garden, from which the sea-view is one of  the finest in England. Froude loved Devonshire folk, and enjoyed  talking to them in their own dialect, or smoking with them on the  shore. He was particularly fond of the indignant expostulation of a  poor woman whose husband had been injured by his own chopper, and  obliged in consequence to keep his bed. If, she said, it had been \"a  visitation of Providence, or the like of that there,\" he would have  borne it patiently. \"But to come upon a man in the wood-house\" was  not in the fitness of things. Froude's favourite places of worship  in London were Westminster Abbey during Dean Stanley's time, and  afterwards the Temple Church, as may be gathered from his Short  Study on the Templars. In Devonshire he frequented an old-fashioned  church where stringed instruments were still played, and was much  delighted with the remark of a fiddler which he overheard. \"Who is  the King of glory?\" had been given out as the anthem. While the  fiddles were tuning up a voice was heard to say: \"Hand us up the  rosin, Tom; us'it soon tell them who's the King of glory.\"    As an editor Froude was tolerant and catholic. \"On controverted  points,\" he said, \"I approve myself of the practice of the  Reformation. When St. Paul's Cross pulpit was occupied one Sunday by  a Lutheran, the next by a Catholic, the next by a Calvinist, all  sides had a hearing, and the preachers knew that they would be  pulled up before the same audience for what they might say.\" His own  literary judgments were rather conventional. The mixture of classes  in Clough's Bothie disturbed him. The genius of Matthew Arnold he  had recognised at once, but then Arnold was a classical, academic  poet. About Tennyson he agreed with the rest of the world, while  Tennyson, who was a personal friend, paid him the great compliment  of taking from him the subject of a poem and the material of a play.  His prejudice against Browning's style, much as he liked Browning  himself, was hard to overcome, and on this point he had a serious  difference with his friend Skelton. \"Browning's verse!\" he exclaims.  \"With intellect, thought, power, grace, all the charms in detail  which poetry should have, it rings after all like a bell of lead.\"  This was in 1863, when Browning had published Men and Women, and  Dramatic Lyrics. However, he admitted Skelton's article on the other  side, and added, with magnificent candour, that \"to this generation  Browning's poetry is as uninteresting as Shakespeare's Sonnets were  to the last century.\" The most fervent Browningite could have said  no more than that. To Mr. Swinburne's Poems and Ballads Froude was  conspicuously fair. There was much in them which offended his  Puritanism, but he was disgusted with the virulence of the critics,  and he allowed Skelton to write in Fraser a qualified apology.    \"The Saturday Review temperament,\" he wrote, \"is ten thousand  thousand times more damnable than the worst of Swinburne's skits.  Modern respectability is so utterly without God, faith, heart; it  shows so singular an ingenuity in and injuring everything that is  noble and good, and so systematic a preference for what is mean and  paltry, that I am not surprised at a young fellow dashing his heels  into the face of it .... When there is any kind of true genius, we  have no right to drive it mad. We must deal with it wisely, justly,  fairly.\"*    --  * Table Talk of Shirley, p. 137.  --    Froude was an excellent editor; appreciative, discriminating, and  alert. He prided himself on Carlyle's approval, though perhaps  Carlyle was not the best judge of such things. His energy was  multifarious. Besides his History and his magazine, he found time  for a stray lecture at odd times, and he could always reckon upon a  good audience. His discourse at the Royal Institution in February,  1864, on \"The Science of History,\" for which he was \"called an  atheist,\" is in the main a criticism of Buckle, the one really  scientific historian. According to Buckle, the history of mankind  was a natural growth, and it was only inadequate knowledge of the  past that made the impossibility of predicting the future. Great men  were like small men, obeying the same natural laws, though a trifle  more erratic in their behaviour. Political economy was history in  little, illustrating the regularity of human, like all other  natural, forces. But can we predict historical events, as we can  predict an eclipse? That is Froude's answer to Buckle, in the form  of a question.    \"Gibbon believed that the era of conquerors was at an end. Had he  lived out the full life of man, he would have seen Europe at the  feet of Napoleon. But a few years ago we believed the world had  grown too civilised for war, and the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park was  to be the inauguration of a new era. Battles, bloody as Napoleon's,  are now the familiar tale of every day; and the arts which have made  the greatest progress are the arts of destruction.\" It is difficult  to see the atheism in all this, but the common sense is plain  enough. Froude belonged to the school of literary historians, such  as were Thucydides and Tacitus, Gibbon and Finlay, not to the school  of Buckle, or, as we should now say, of Professor Bury.    In 1865 Froude removed from Clifton Place, Hyde Park, to Onslow  Gardens in South Kensington, where he lived for the next quarter of  a century. In 1868 the students of St. Andrews chose him to be Lord  Rector of the University, and on the 23rd of March, 1869, he  delivered his Inaugural Address on Education, which compared the  plain living and high thinking of the Scottish Universities with the  expensive and luxurious idleness that he remembered at Oxford.  Froude was delighted with the compliment the students had paid him,  and they were equally charmed with their Rector. In fact, his visit  to St. Andrews produced in 1869 a suggestion that he should become  the Parliamentary representative of that University and of  Edinburgh. But the injustice of the law as it then stood  disqualified him as a candidate. His deacon's orders, the shadowy  remnant of a mistaken choice, stood in his"]]]
