The French call it 'Poule  d'Aurigny,' from which one might suppose it was more common in this  neighbourhood than elsewhere.\" Miss C.B. Carey records one in the  'Zoologist' as killed in November, and Mr. Couch another as having been  shot on the 31st December. I have also seen one or two hanging up in the  market, and others at Mr. Couch's, late in November; and one is recorded  in the 'Guernsey Mail and Telegraph' as having been shot by Mr. De  Putron, of the Catel, on the 3rd January, 1879. From these dates, as  well as from Mr. MacCulloch's remark that it is not uncommon in the  winter, it would appear that--as in the Land's End district in  Cornwall--the Thick-knee reverses the usual time of its visits to the  British Islands, being a winter instead of a summer visitant; and  probably for the same reason, namely, that the latitude of the Channel  Islands, like that of Cornwall, is about the same as that of its most  northern winter range on the Continent.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, but only marks it as occurring  in Guernsey. There is one specimen in the Museum.      102. PEEWIT. _Vanellus vulgaris_, Bechstein. French, \"Vanneau  huppe.\"--The Peewit is a common and rather numerous autumn and winter  visitant to all the Islands, though I have never seen it in such large  flocks as in some parts of England, especially in Somerset. Those that  do come to the Islands appear to take very good care of themselves, for  I have always found them very difficult to get a shot at, and very few  make their appearance in the market. Though generally a winter visitant,  I have seen occasional stragglers in summer. On the 9th July this year  (1878), for instance, I saw one fly by me in L'Ancresse Bay; this was  either a young bird, or, if an adult, was not in breeding plumage, as I  could clearly see that the throat was white--- not black, as in the  adult in breeding plumage. A few days afterwards, July 19th,  another--or, perhaps, the same--was shot by some quarry-men on the  common; this was certainly a young bird of the year, and I had a good  opportunity of looking at it. In spite of occasional stragglers of this  sort making their appearance in the summer, I have never been able to  find that the Peewit breeds on any of the Islands; but, by the 9th of  July, stragglers, both old and young, might easily come from the  opposite coast of Dorsetshire, where a good many breed, or from the  north of France.    Professor Ansted includes the Peewit in his list, but only marks it as  occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen in the Museum at present.      103. GREY PLOVER. _Squatarola helvetica_, Linnaeus. French, \"Vanneau  pluvier.\"--The Grey Plover is a regular but by no means numerous  visitant to the coast of all the Islands during the winter months, but I  have never found it in flocks like the Golden Plover. A few fall victims  to the numerous gunners who frequent the shores during the autumn and  winter, and consequently it occasionally makes its appearance in the  market, where I believe it often passes for a Golden Plover, especially  in the case of young birds on their first arrival in November; but for  the sake of the unknowing in such matters, I may say that they need  never be deceived, as the Grey Plover has a hind toe, and also has the  axillary plume or the longish feathers under the wing black, while the  Golden Plover has no hind toe and the axillary plume white: a little  attention to these distinctions, which hold good at all ages and in all  plumages, may occasionally save a certain amount of disappointment at  dinner time, as the Grey Plover is apt to taste muddy and fishy, and is  by no means so good as the Golden Plover.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey. There are two specimens in the Museum, both in winter  plumage. Indeed, I do not know that it even remains long enough in the  Channel Islands to assume, even partially, the black-breast of the  breeding plumage, as it so often does in England.      104. GOLDEN PLOVER. _Charadrius pluvialis_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pluvier  dore.\"--A common winter visitant to all the Islands, arriving about the  end of October or beginning of November, and remaining till the spring,  sometimes till they have nearly assumed the black breast of the  breeding-season; but I do not know that the Golden Plover ever breeds in  the Islands, at all events in the present day.    Professor Ansted includes the Golden Plover in his list, and marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is one specimen in the Museum,  probably killed rather late in the spring, as it is assuming the black  breast.      105. DOTTEREL. _Eudromias morinellus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pluvier  guignard.\"--The common Dotterel is a rare occasional visitant to the  Channel Islands, occurring, however, on both the spring and autumn  migration, as Mr. MacCulloch says he has a note of a Dotterel killed in  May, 1849; he does not say in which of the Islands, but probably in  Guernsey; and I have a skin of one, a fine full-plumaged bird, according  to Mr. Couch, who forwarded me the skin, a female by dissection, killed  in Herm on the 26th of April, 1877. Another skin I have is that of a  young bird of the year, killed in the autumn, I should think early in  the autumn--August or September; and the Rev. A. Morres, who kindly gave  me this last one, has also a skin of one killed at the same time; both  of these were Guernsey killed.    The Dotterel is included in Professor Ansted's list, and by him marked  as having occurred in Guernsey and Sark. I should think Alderney a more  likely place for the bird to have occurred than Sark, but I have not  been able to gain any information about its occurrence there; neither  the carpenter bird-stuffer nor his sporting friend had a skin or any  part of the bird. There is no specimen now in the Museum.      106. RING DOTTEREL. _AEgialitis hiaticula_, Linnaeus. French, \"Grand  pluvier a collier,\" \"Pluvier a collier.\"--The Ring Dotterel is very  common in all the Islands in places suited to it. Some remain throughout  the summer, and a few of these, but certainly very few, may breed in the  Islands; the great majority, however, of those that frequent the coast  in the winter are migrants, arriving in the autumn and departing again  in the spring. Some, however, appear to arrive very early, and cannot  have bred very far off, perhaps on the neighbouring coast of France or  Dorset. I have the following note on the subject in the 'Zoologist' for  1866, which gives the time of their arrival pretty correctly. During the  first two or three weeks after my arrival--that was on the 21st of June,  1866--I found Ring Dotterels excessively scarce even on parts of the  coast, where, on other visits later in the year, I had found them very  numerous. Towards the middle of July, however, they began to frequent  their usual haunts in small parties of six or seven, most probably the  old birds with their young. These parties increased in number to twenty  or thirty, and before my departure, on the last day of July, they  mustered quite as thickly as I had ever seen them before. On another  summer visit to Guernsey, from the 3rd to the 19th of June, 1876, I did  not see any Ring Dotterel at all, though at the time Kentish Plover were  common in most of the bays in the low parts of the Island. The Ring  Dotterel must therefore have selected some breeding-place separate from  the Kentish Plover, probably not very far off; but I do not believe it  breeds at all commonly in the Islands. This agrees very much with what I  saw of the Ring Dotterel this year (1878); there were a few in  L'Ancresse and one or two other bays, but none in Grand Havre, close to  which I was living, and I very much doubt if any of those I saw were  breeding. Neither Colonel l'Estrange nor I found any eggs, though we  searched hard for them both in '76 and '78; neither did we find any eggs  either in Herm or Alderney.    Professor Ansted includes the Ring Dotterel in his list, but marks it  as only occurring in Guernsey. There is a specimen in the Museum.      107. KENTISH PLOVER. _AEgialitis cantianus_, Latham. French, \"Pluvier a  collier interrompu.\" I have always looked upon the Kentish Plover as  only a summer visitant to the Islands, never having seen it in any of my  visits in October and November; but Mr. Harvie Brown mentions  ('Zoologist' for 1869) seeing some of these birds in January, at Herm,  feeding with the Ring Dotterel, but he says they always separated when  they rose to fly. If he is not mistaken, which my own experience  inclines me to think he was, we must look upon the Kentish Plover as  partially resident in the Islands, the greater number, however,  departing in the autumn. Until this summer (1878) I have been  unsuccessful in finding the eggs of the Kentish Plover, though I have  had many hard searches for them; and they are very difficult to find,  unless the bird is actually seen to run from the nest, or rather from  the eggs, for, as a rule, nest there is none, the eggs being only placed  on the sand, with which they get half buried, when they may easily be  mistaken for a small bit of speckled granite and passed by. In the  summer of 1866, a friend and myself had a long search for the eggs of a  pair we saw and were certain had eggs, as they practised all the usual  devices to decoy us from them, till my friend, actually thinking one of  the birds to be badly wounded, set his dog at it; after this all chance  was over: this was in a small sandy bay, called Port Soif, near the  Grand Rocques Barracks. I mention this as I am certain these birds had  eggs or young somewhere close to us, and this was the farthest point  towards Vazon Bay from the Vale I found them breeding. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#19)"],[1," atmosphere, which, as  we have seen, carries away what is bad for us and at the same time good  for them,--what is disease to the one being health to the other. So are we  made dependent, not merely upon our fellow-creatures, but upon our  fellow-existers, all Nature being tied together by the laws that make one  part conduce to the good of another.    There is another little point which I must mention before we draw to a  close--a point which concerns the whole of these operations, and most  curious and beautiful it is to see it clustering upon and associated with  the bodies that concern us--oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, in different  states of their existence. I shewed you just now some powdered lead, which  I set burning[18]; and you saw that the moment the fuel was brought to the  air, it acted, even before it got out of the bottle--the moment the air  crept in, it acted. Now, there is a case of chemical affinity by which all  our operations proceed. When we breathe, the same operation is going on  within us. When we burn a candle, the attraction of the different parts  one to the other is going on. Here it is going on in this case of the  lead; and it is a beautiful instance of chemical affinity. If the products  of combustion rose off from the surface, the lead would take fire, and go  on burning to the end; but you remember that we have this difference  between charcoal and lead--that, while the lead can start into action at  once, if there be access of air to it, the carbon will remain days, weeks,  months, or years. The manuscripts of Herculaneum were written with  carbonaceous ink, and there they have been for 1,800 years or more, not  having been at all changed by the atmosphere, though coming in contact  with it under various circumstances. Now, what is the circumstance which  makes the lead and carbon differ in this respect? It is a striking thing  to see that the matter which is appointed to serve the purpose of fuel  _waits_ in its action: it does not start off burning, like the lead and  many other things that I could shew you; but which I have not encumbered  the table with; but it waits for action. This waiting is a curious and  wonderful thing. Candles--those Japanese candles, for instance--do not  start into action at once, like the lead or iron (for iron finely divided  does the same thing as lead), but there they wait for years, perhaps for  ages, without undergoing any alteration. I have here a supply of coal-gas.  The jet is giving forth the gas, but you see it does not take fire--it  comes out into the air, but it waits till it is hot enough before it  burns. If I make it hot enough, it takes fire. If I blow it out, the gas  that is issuing forth waits till the light is applied to it again. It is  curious to see how different substances wait--how some will wait till the  temperature is raised a little, and others till it is raised a good deal.  I have here a little gunpowder and some gun-cotton; even these things  differ in the conditions under which they will burn. The gunpowder is  composed of carbon and other substances, making it highly combustible; and  the gun-cotton is another combustible preparation. They are both waiting,  but they will start into activity at different degrees of heat, or under  different conditions. By applying a heated wire to them, we shall see  which will start first [touching the gun-cotton with the hot iron]. You  see the gun-cotton has gone off, but not even the hottest part of the wire  is now hot enough to fire the gunpowder. How beautifully that shews you  the difference in the degree in which bodies act in this way! In the one  case the substance will wait any time until the associated bodies are made  active by heat; but in the other, as in the process of respiration, it  waits no time. In the lungs, as soon as the air enters, it unites with the  carbon; even in the lowest temperature which the body can bear short of  being frozen, the action begins at once, producing the carbonic acid of  respiration: and so all things go on fitly and properly. Thus you see the  analogy between respiration and combustion is rendered still more  beautiful and striking. Indeed, all I can say to you at the end of these  lectures (for we must come to an end at one time or other) is to express a  wish that you may, in your generation, be fit to compare to a candle; that  you may, like it, shine as lights to those about you; that, in all your  actions, you may justify the beauty of the taper by making your deeds  honourable and effectual in the discharge of your duty to your fellow-men.          LECTURE ON PLATINUM.    [_Delivered before the_ ROYAL INSTITUTION, _on Friday, February 22,  1861._]      Whether I was to have the honour of appearing before you this evening or  not, seemed to be doubtful upon one or two points. One of these I will  mention immediately; the other may or may not appear during the course of  the hour that follows. The first point is this. When I was tempted to  promise this subject for your attention this evening, it was founded upon  a promise, and a full intent of performing that promise, on the part of my  friend Deville, of Paris, to come here to shew before you a phenomenon in  metallurgic chemistry not common. In that I have been disappointed. His  intention was to have fused here some thirty or forty pounds of platinum,  and so to have made manifest, through my mouth and my statement, the  principles of a new process in metallurgy, in relation to this beautiful,  magnificent, and valuable metal; but circumstances over which neither he  nor I, nor others concerned, have sufficient control, have prevented the  fulfilment of that intention; and the period at which I learned the fact  was so recent, that I could hardly leave my place here to be filled by  another, or permit you, who in your kindness have come to hear what might  be said, to remain unreceived in the best manner possible to me under the  circumstances. I therefore propose to state, as well as I can, what the  principles are on which M. Deville proceeds, by means of drawings, and  some subordinate or inferior experiments. The metal platinum, of which you  see some very fine specimens on the table, has been known to us about a  hundred years. It has been wrought in a beautiful way in this country, in  France, and elsewhere, and supplied to the consumer in ingots of this  kind, or in plates, such as we have here, or in masses, that by their very  fall upon the table indicate the great weight of the substance, which is,  indeed, nearly at the head of all substances in that respect. This  substance has been given to us hitherto mainly through the philosophy of  Dr. Wollaston, whom many of us know, and it is obtained in great purity  and beauty. It is a very remarkable metal in many points, besides its  known special uses. It usually comes to us in grains. Here is a very fine  specimen of native platinum in grains. Here is also a nugget or ingot, and  here are some small pieces gathered out of certain alluvial soils in  Brazil, Mexico, California, and the Uralian districts of Russia.    It is strange that this metal is almost always found associated with some  four or five other metals, most curious in their qualities and  characteristics. They are called platiniferous metals; and they have not  only the relation of being always found associated in this manner, but  they have other relations of a curious nature, which I shall point out to  you by a reference to one of the tables behind me. This substance is  always native--it is always in the metallic state; and the metals with  which it is found connected, and which are rarely found elsewhere, are  palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. We have the names in  one of the tables arranged in two columns, representing, as you see, two  groups--platinum, iridium, and osmium constituting one group; and  ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium the other. Three of these have the  chemical equivalent of 98-1/2, and the others a chemical equivalent of  about half that number. Then the metals of one group have an extreme  specific gravity--platinum being, in fact, the lightest of the three, or  as light as the lightest. Osmium has a specific gravity of 21.4, and is  the heaviest body in nature; platinum is 21.15, and iridium the same; the  specific gravity of the other three being only about half that, namely,  11.3, 12.1, and 11.8. Then there is this curious relation, that palladium  and iridium are very much alike, so that you would scarcely know one from  the other, though one has only half the weight of the other, and only half  the equivalent power. So with iridium and rhodium, and osmium and  ruthenium, which are so closely allied that they make pairs, being  separated each from its own group. Then these metals are the most  infusible that we possess. Osmium is the most difficult to fuse: indeed, I  believe it never has been fused, while every other metal has. Ruthenium  comes next, iridium next, rhodium next, platinum next (so that it ranks  here as a pretty fusible metal, and yet we have been long accustomed to  speak of the infusibility of platinum), and next comes palladium, which is  the most fusible metal of the whole. It is a curious thing to see this  fine association of physical properties coming out in metals which are  grouped together somehow or other in nature, but, no doubt, by causes  which are related to analogous properties in their situation on the  surface of the earth, for it is in alluvial soils that these things are  found.    Now, with regard to this substance, let me tell you briefly how we get it.  The process used to be this. The ore which I shewed you just now was  taken, and digested in nitro-muriatic acid of a certain strength, and  partly converted into a solution, with the leaving behind of certain  bodies that I have upon the table.  The platinum being dissolved with care  in acids, to the"]]]
