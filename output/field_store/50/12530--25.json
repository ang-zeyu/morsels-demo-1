And why the hasty  after-indorsement of the decision by the President and others?    We cannot absolutely know that all these adaptations are the result of  preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions  of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and  by different workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance  (Douglas, Pierce, Taney, Buchanan),--and when we see those timbers  joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a  mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths  and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their  respective places, and not a piece too many or too few, not omitting  even scaffolding--or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in  the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in,--in  such a case, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and  Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the  beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft, drawn up before  the first blow was struck.    It should not be overlooked that by the Nebraska bill the people of a  State as well as Territory were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject  only to the Constitution.\" Why mention a State? They were legislating  for Territories, and not for or about States. Certainly the people of a  State are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United  States; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial  law? Why are the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein  lumped together, and their relation to the Constitution therein treated  as being precisely the same? While the opinion of the Court by Chief  Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions of all  the concurring judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of the  United States neither permits Congress nor a territorial legislature to  exclude slavery from any United States Territory, they all omit to  declare whether or not the same Constitution permits a State or the  people of a State to exclude it. _Possibly_ this is a mere omission; but  who can be quite sure if McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the  opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a State to  exclude slavery from their limits,--just as Chase and Mace sought to get  such declaration in behalf of the people of a Territory, into the  Nebraska Bill,--I ask, who can be quite sure that it would not have been  voted down in the one case as it had been in the other? The nearest  approach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery is  made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise  idea, and almost the language too, of the Nebraska act. On one occasion  his exact language is \"except in cases where the power is restrained by  the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme  over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.\" In what cases the  power of the State is so restrained by the United States Constitution is  left an open question, precisely as the same question, as to the  restraint on the power of the Territories, was left open in the Nebraska  act. Put this and that together, and we have another nice little niche,  which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision,  declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit _a  State_ to exclude slavery from its limits. And this may especially be  expected if the doctrine of \"care not whether slavery be voted down or  voted up\" shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise  that such a decision can be maintained when made.    Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in  all the States. Welcome or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming,  and will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political  dynasty shall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down, pleasantly  dreaming that the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their  State free, and we shall awake to the reality instead, that the Supreme  Court has made Illinois a slave State. To meet and overthrow the power  of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that  consummation. That is what we have to do. How can we best do it?    There are those who denounce us openly to their own friends, and yet  whisper to us softly that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there  is with which to effect that object. They wish us to _infer_ all from  the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of that  dynasty, and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon  which he and we have never differed. They remind us that he is a great  man and that the largest of us are very small ones. Let this be granted.  But \"a living dog is better than a dead lion.\" Judge Douglas, if not a  dead lion, for this work is at least a caged and toothless one. How can  he oppose the advances of slavery? He don't care anything about it. His  avowed mission is impressing the \"public heart\" to _care nothing about  it_. A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper thinks Douglas's superior  talent will be needed to resist the revival of the African slave-trade.  Does Douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching? He  has not said so. Does he really think so? But if it is, how can he  resist it? For years he has laboured to prove it a sacred right of white  men to take negro slaves into the new territories. Can he possibly show  that it is a less sacred right to buy them where they can be bought  cheapest? And unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in Africa than  in Virginia. He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question  of slavery to one of a mere right of property: and, as such, how can he  oppose the foreign slave-trade?--how can he refuse that trade in that  property shall be \"perfectly free,\" unless he does it as a protection to  home production? And as the home producers will probably not ask the  protection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.    Senator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be wiser  to-day than he was yesterday--that he may rightfully change when he  finds himself wrong. But can we, for that reason, run ahead, and infer  that he will make any particular change, of which he himself has given  no intimation? Can we safely base our action upon any such vague  inference?    Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent Judge Douglas's position,  question his motives, or do aught that can be personally offensive to  him. Whenever, if ever, he and we can come together on principle, so  that our cause may have assistance from his great ability, I hope to  have interposed no adventitious obstacle. But, clearly, he is not now  with us--he does not pretend to be--he does not promise ever to be.    Our cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted by, its own  undoubted friends--those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the  work, who do care for the result. Two years ago the Republicans of the  nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under  the single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external  circumstance against us. Of strange, discordant, and even hostile  elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the  battle through, under the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and  pampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now?--now, when that  same enemy is wavering, dissevered, and belligerent? The result is not  doubtful. We shall not fail. If we stand firm, we shall not fail. Wise  counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it; but sooner or later the  victory is sure to come.          _Lincoln's Reply to Judge Douglas at Chicago on Popular Sovereignty, the  Nebraska Bill, etc. July 10, 1858_      ... Popular sovereignty! everlasting popular sovereignty! Let us for a  moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty. What is  popular sovereignty? We recollect that at an early period in the history  of this struggle, there was another name for the same thing,--_squatter  sovereignty_. It was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter  sovereignty. What do these terms mean? What do those terms mean when  used now? And vast credit is taken by our friend, the Judge, in regard  to his support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have  been, and all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this  matter of popular sovereignty. What is it? Why, it is the sovereignty of  the people! What was squatter sovereignty? I suppose, if it had any  signification at all, it was the right of the people to govern  themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs, while they were  squatted down in a country not their own,--while they had squatted on a  territory that did not belong to them, in the sense that a State belongs  to the people who inhabit it,--when it belonged to the nation; such  right to govern themselves was called \"squatter sovereignty.\"    Now, I wish you to mark, What has become of that squatter sovereignty?  What has become of it? Can you get anybody to tell you now that the  people of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard  to this mooted question of slavery, before they form a State  constitution? No such thing at all, although there is a general running  fire, and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that  side, assuming that policy had given to the people of a Territory the  right to govern themselves upon this question; yet the point is dodged.  To-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided by  the Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon  to-day--that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude slavery  from a Territory; that if any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#19)"],[1,"accounts of the Chamberlain of Scotland there are items for the  maintenance of the King for eleven years. But popular tales die hard,  and doubtless you will hear the groans and see the ghost of the  wronged Richard some moonlight night in the ruined keep of Pontefract.  He has many companion ghosts--the Earl of Salisbury, Richard Duke of  York, Anthony Wydeville, Earl Rivers and Grey his brother, and Sir  Thomas Vaughan, whose feet trod the way to the block, that was worn  hard by many victims. The dying days of the old castle made it  illustrious. It was besieged three times, taken and retaken, and saw  amazing scenes of gallantry and bravery. It held out until after the  death of the martyr king; it heard the proclamation of Charles II, but  at length was compelled to surrender, and \"the strongest inland  garrison in the kingdom,\" as Oliver Cromwell termed it, was slighted  and made a ruin. Its sister fortress Knaresborough shared its fate.  Lord Lytton, in _Eugene Aram_, wrote of it:--      \"You will be at a loss to recognise now the truth of old Leland's    description of that once stout and gallant bulwark of the north,    when 'he numbrid 11 or 12 Toures in the walles of the Castel, and    one very fayre beside in the second area.' In that castle the four    knightly murderers of the haughty Becket (the Wolsey of his age)    remained for a whole year, defying the weak justice of the times.    There, too, the unfortunate Richard II passed some portion of his    bitter imprisonment. And there, after the battle of Marston Moor,    waved the banner of the loyalists against the soldiers of    Lilburn.\"    An interesting story is told of the siege. A youth, whose father was  in the garrison, each night went into the deep, dry moat, climbed up  the glacis, and put provisions through a hole where his father stood  ready to receive them. He was seen at length, fired on by the  Parliamentary soldiers, and sentenced to be hanged in sight of the  besieged as a warning to others. But a good lady obtained his respite,  and after the conquest of the place was released. The castle then,  once the residence of Piers Gaveston, of Henry III, and of John of  Gaunt, was dismantled and destroyed.    During the reign of Henry III great progress was made in the  improvement and development of castle-building. The comfort and  convenience of the dwellers in these fortresses were considered, and  if not very luxurious places they were made more beautiful by art and  more desirable as residences. During the reigns of the Edwards this  progress continued, and a new type of castle was introduced. The  stern, massive, and high-towering keep was abandoned, and the  fortifications arranged in a concentric fashion. A fine hall with  kitchens occupied the centre of the fortress; a large number of  chambers were added. The stronghold itself consisted of a large square  or oblong like that at Donnington, Berkshire, and the approach was  carefully guarded by strong gateways, advanced works, walled  galleries, and barbicans. Deep moats filled with water increased their  strength and improved their beauty.    We will give some examples of these Edwardian castles, of which Leeds  Castle, Kent, is a fine specimen. It stands on three islands in a  sheet of water about fifteen acres in extent, these islands being  connected in former times by double drawbridges. It consists of two  huge piles of buildings which with a strong gate-house and barbican  form four distinct forts, capable of separate defence should any one  or other fall into the hands of an enemy. Three causeways, each with  its drawbridge, gate, and portcullis, lead to the smallest island or  inner barbican, a fortified mill contributing to the defences. A stone  bridge connects this island with the main island. There stands the  Constable's Tower, and a stone wall surrounds the island and within is  the modern mansion. The Maiden's Tower and the Water Tower defend the  island on the south. A two-storeyed building on arches now connects  the main island with the Tower of the Gloriette, which has a curious  old bell with the Virgin and Child, St. George and the Dragon, and the  Crucifixion depicted on it, and an ancient clock. The castle withstood  a siege in the time of Edward II because Queen Isabella was refused  admission. The King hung the Governor, Thomas de Colepepper, by the  chain of the drawbridge. Henry IV retired here on account of the  Plague in London, and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, was imprisoned  here. It was a favourite residence of the Court in the fourteenth and  fifteenth centuries. Here the wife of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,  was tried for witchcraft. Dutch prisoners were confined here in 1666  and contrived to set fire to some of the buildings. It is the home of  the Wykeham Martin family, and is one of the most picturesque castles  in the country.    In the same neighbourhood is Allington Castle, an ivy-mantled ruin,  another example of vanished glory, only two tenements occupying the  princely residence of the Wyatts, famous in the history of State and  Letters. Sir Henry, the father of the poet, felt the power of the  Hunchback Richard, and was racked and imprisoned in Scotland, and  would have died in the Tower of London but for a cat. He rose to great  honour under Henry VII, and here entertained the King in great style.  At Allington the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt was born, and spent his days in  writing prose and verse, hunting and hawking, and occasionally  dallying after Mistress Anne Boleyn at the neighbouring castle of  Hever. He died here in 1542, and his son Sir Thomas led the  insurrection against Queen Mary and sealed the fate of himself and his  race.    Hever Castle, to which allusion has been made, is an example of the  transition between the old fortress and the more comfortable mansion  of a country squire or magnate. Times were less dangerous, the country  more peaceful when Sir Geoffrey Boleyn transformed and rebuilt the  castle built in the reign of Edward III by William de Hever, but the  strong entrance-gate flanked by towers, embattled and machicolated,  and defended by stout doors and three portcullises and the surrounding  moat, shows that the need of defence had not quite passed away. The  gates lead into a courtyard around which the hall, chapel, and  domestic chambers are grouped. The long gallery Anne Boleyn so often  traversed with impatience still seems to re-echo her steps, and her  bedchamber, which used to contain some of the original furniture, has  always a pathetic interest. The story of the courtship of Henry VIII  with \"the brown girl with a perthroat and an extra finger,\" as  Margaret More described her, is well known. Her old home, which was  much in decay, has passed into the possession of a wealthy American  gentleman, and has been recently greatly restored and transformed.    Sussex can boast of many a lordly castle, and in its day Bodiam must  have been very magnificent. Even in its decay and ruin it is one of  the most beautiful in England. It combined the palace of the feudal  lord and the fortress of a knight. The founder, Sir John Dalyngrudge,  was a gallant soldier in the wars of Edward III, and spent most of his  best years in France, where he had doubtless learned the art of making  his house comfortable as well as secure. He acquired licence to  fortify his castle in 1385 \"for resistance against our enemies.\" There  was need of strong walls, as the French often at that period ravaged  the coast of Sussex, burning towns and manor-houses. Clark, the great  authority on castles, says that \"Bodiam is a complete and typical  castle of the end of the fourteenth century, laid out entirely on a  new site, and constructed after one design and at one period. It but  seldom happens that a great fortress is wholly original, of one, and  that a known, date, and so completely free from alterations or  additions.\" It is nearly square, with circular tower sixty-five feet  high at the four corners, connected by embattled curtain-walls, in the  centre of each of which square towers rise to an equal height with the  circular. The gateway is a large structure composed of two flanking  towers defended by numerous oiletts for arrows, embattled parapets,  and deep machicolations. Over the gateway are three shields bearing  the arms of Bodiam, Dalyngrudge, and Wardieu. A huge portcullis still  frowns down upon us, and two others opposed the way, while above are  openings in the vault through which melted lead, heated sand, pitch,  and other disagreeable things could be poured on the heads of the foe.  In the courtyard on the south stands the great hall with its oriel,  buttery, and kitchen, and amidst the ruins you can discern the chapel,  sacristy, ladies' bower, presence chamber. The castle stayed not long  in the family of the builder, his son John probably perishing in the  wars, and passed to Sir Thomas Lewknor, who opposed Richard III, and  was therefore attainted of high treason and his castle besieged and  taken. It was restored to him again by Henry VII, but the Lewknors  never resided there again. Waller destroyed it after the capture of  Arundel, and since that time it has been left a prey to the rains and  frosts and storms, but manages to preserve much of its beauty, and to  tell how noble knights lived in the days of chivalry.    Caister Castle is one of the four principal castles in Norfolk. It is  built of brick, and is one of the earliest edifices in England  constructed of that material after its rediscovery as suitable for  building purposes. It stands with its strong defences not far from the  sea on the barren coast. It was built by Sir John Fastolfe, who fought  with great distinction in the French wars of Henry V and Henry VI, and  was the hero of the Battle of the Herrings in 1428, when he defeated  the French and succeeded in convoying a load of herrings in triumph to  the English camp before"]]]
