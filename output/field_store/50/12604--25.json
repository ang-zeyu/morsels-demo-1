CHAPTER XXIV    Of avoiding of curious inquiry into the life of another    \"My Son, be not curious, nor trouble thyself with vain cares.  What is that to thee?  Follow thou Me.(1)  For what is it to thee  whether a man be this or that, or say or do thus or thus?  Thou  hast no need to answer for others, but thou must give an answer  for thyself.  Why therefore dost thou entangle thyself?  Behold,  I know all men, and I behold all things which are done under the  sun; and I know how it standeth with each one, what he thinketh,  what he willeth, and to what end his thoughts reach.  All things  therefore are to be committed to Me; watch thou thyself in godly  peace, and leave him who is unquiet to be unquiet as he will.  Whatsoever he shall do or say, shall come unto him, for he cannot  deceive Me.    2. \"Trouble not thyself about the shadow of a great name, nor  about the friendship of many, nor about the love of men towards  thee.  For these things beget distraction and great sorrows of  heart.  My word should speak freely unto thee, and I would reveal  secrets, if only thou didst diligently look for My appearing, and  didst open unto Me the gates of thy heart.  Be sober and watch  unto prayer,(2) and humble thyself in all things.\"    (1) John xxi. 12.   (2) 1 Peter iv. 7.      CHAPTER XXV    Wherein firm peace of heart and true profit consist    \"My Son, I have said, Peace I leave with you, My peace I give  unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you.(1)  All men  desire peace, but all do not care for the things which belong  unto true peace.  My peace is with the humble and lowly in heart.  Thy peace shall be in much patience.  If thou heardest Me, and  didst follow My voice, thou shouldest enjoy much peace.\"    2. What then shall I do, Lord?    3. \"In everything take heed to thyself what thou doest, and what  thou sayest; and direct all thy purpose to this, that thou please  Me alone, and desire or seek nothing apart from Me.  But,  moreover, judge nothing rashly concerning the words or deeds of  others, nor meddle with matters which are not committed to thee;  and it may be that thou shalt be disturbed little or rarely.  Yet  never to feel any disquiet, nor to suffer any pain of heart or  body, this belongeth not to the present life, but is the state of  eternal rest.  Therefore count not thyself to have found true  peace, if thou hast felt no grief; nor that then all is well if  thou hast no adversary; nor that this is perfect if all things  fall out according to thy desire.  Nor then reckon thyself to be  anything great, or think that thou art specially beloved, if thou  art in a state of great fervour and sweetness of spirit; for not  by these things is the true lover of virtue known, nor in them  doth the profit and perfection of man consist.\"    4. In what then, Lord?    5. \"In offering thyself with all thy heart to the Divine Will, in  not seeking the things which are thine own, whether great or  small, whether temporal or eternal; so that thou remain with the  same steady countenance in giving of thanks between prosperity  and adversity, weighing all things in an equal balance.  If thou  be so brave and long-suffering in hope that when inward comfort  is taken from thee, thou even prepare thy heart for the more  endurance, and justify not thyself, as though thou oughtest not  to suffer these heavy things, but dost justify Me in all things  that I appoint, and dost bless My Holy Name, then dost thou walk  in the true and right way of peace, and shalt have a sure hope  that thou shalt again behold My face with joy.  For if thou come  to an utter contempt of thyself, know that then thou shalt enjoy  abundance of peace, as much as is possible where thou art but a  wayfaring man.\"    (1) John xiv. 27.      CHAPTER XXVI    Of the exaltation of a free spirit, which humble prayer more  deserveth than doth frequent reading    Lord, this is the work of a perfect man, never to slacken his  mind from attention to heavenly things, and among many cares to  pass along as it were without care, not after the manner of one  indifferent, but rather with the privilege of a free mind,  cleaving to no creature with inordinate affection.    2. I beseech Thee, my most merciful Lord God, preserve me from  the cares of this life, lest I become too much entangled; from  many necessities of the body, lest I be taken captive by  pleasure; from all obstacles of the spirit, lest I be broken and  cast down with cares.  I say not from those things which the  vanity of the world goeth about after with all eagerness, but  from those miseries, which by the universal curse of mortality  weigh down and hold back the soul of thy servant in punishment,  that it cannot enter into liberty of spirit, so often as it  would.    3. O my God, sweetness unspeakable, turn into bitterness all my  fleshly consolation, which draweth me away from the love of  eternal things, and wickedly allureth toward itself by setting  before me some present delight.  Let not, O my God, let not flesh  and blood prevail over me, let not the world and its short glory  deceive me, let not the devil and his craftiness supplant me.  Give me courage to resist, patience to endure, constancy to  persevere. Grant, in place of all consolations of the world, the  most sweet unction of Thy Spirit, and in place of carnal love,  pour into me the love of Thy Name.    4. Behold, food and drink and clothing, and all the other needs  appertaining to the support of the body, are burdensome to the  devout spirit.  Grant that I may use such things with moderation,  and that I be not entangled with inordinate affection for them.  To cast away all these things is not lawful, because nature must  be sustained, but to require superfluities and things which  merely minister delight, the holy law forbiddeth; for otherwise  the flesh would wax insolent against the spirit.  In all these  things, I beseech Thee, let Thy hand guide and teach me, that I  in no way exceed.      CHAPTER XXVII    That personal love greatly hindereth from the highest good    \"My Son, thou must give all for all, and be nothing of thine own.  Know thou that the love of thyself is more hurtful to thee than  anything in the world.  According to the love and inclination  which thou hast, everything more or less cleaveth to thee.  If  thy love be pure, sincere, well-regulated, thou shalt not be in  captivity to anything.  Do not covet what thou mayest not have;  do not have what is able to hinder thee, and to rob thee of  inward liberty.  It is wonderful that thou committest not thyself  to Me from the very bottom of thy heart, with all things which  thou canst desire or have.    2. \"Why art thou consumed with vain sorrow?  Why art thou wearied  with superfluous cares?  Stand thou by My good pleasure, and thou  shalt suffer no loss.  If thou seekest after this or that, and  wilt be here or there, according to thine own advantage or the  fulfilling of thine own pleasure, thou shalt never be in quiet,  nor free from care, because in everything somewhat will be found  lacking, and everywhere there will be somebody who opposeth thee.    3. \"Therefore it is not gaining or multiplying of this thing or  that which advantageth thee, but rather the despising it and  cutting it by the root out of thy heart; which thou must not only  understand of money and riches, but of the desire after honour  and vain praise, things which all pass away with the world.  The  place availeth little if the spirit of devotion is wanting; nor  shall that peace stand long which is sought from abroad, if the  state of thy heart is without the true foundation, that is, if it  abide not in Me.  Thou mayest change, but thou canst not better  thyself; for when occasion ariseth and is accepted thou shalt  find what thou didst fly from, yea more.\"      A PRAYER FOR CLEANSING OF THE HEART AND FOR HEAVENLY WISDOM    4. Strengthen me, O God, by the grace of Thy Holy Spirit.  Give  me virtue to be strengthened with might in the inner man, and to  free my heart from all fruitless care and trouble, and that I be  not drawn away by various desires after any things whatsoever,  whether of little value or great, but that I may look upon all as  passing away, and myself as passing away with them; because there  is no profit under the sun, and all is vanity and vexation of  spirit.(1)  Oh how wise is he that considereth thus!    5. Give me, O Lord, heavenly wisdom, that I may learn to seek  Thee above all things and to find Thee; to relish Thee above all  things and to love Thee; and to understand all other things, even  as they are, according to the order of Thy wisdom.  Grant me  prudently to avoid the flatterer, and patiently to bear with him  that opposeth me; for this is great wisdom, not to be carried  by every wind of words, nor to give ear to the wicked flattering  Siren; for thus do we go safely on in the way we have begun.    (1) Ecclesiastes ii. 11.      CHAPTER XXVIII    Against the tongues of detractors    \"My Son, take it not sadly to heart, if any think ill of thee,  and say of thee what thou art unwilling to hear.  Thou oughtest  to think worse of thyself, and to believe no man weaker than  thyself.  If thou walkest inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying  words above their value.  It is no small prudence to keep silence  in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto Me, and not to be  troubled by human judgment.    2. \"Let not thy peace depend upon the word of men; for whether  they judge well or ill of thee, thou art not therefore any other  man than thyself.  Where is true peace or true glory?  Is it not  in Me?  And he who seeketh not to please men, nor feareth to  displease, shall enjoy abundant peace.  From inordinate love and  vain fear ariseth all disquietude of heart, and all distraction  of the senses.\"      CHAPTER XXIX    How when tribulation cometh we must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#19)"],[1,"ndation. The clearing away was most difficult. Parts had to  be blown up with gunpowder. It is said that when he was giving  instructions to the builders on clearing away the ruins, he called on  a workman to bring a great flat stone, which he might use as a centre  in marking out on the ground the circle of the dome. The man took out  of the rubbish the first large stone that came to hand, which was a  piece of gravestone, and, when it was laid down, it was found to have  on it the single word \"RESURGAM.\" He took this, and there was no  superstition in such an idea, as a promise from God.

In one paper he  personates the Cathedral, and expresses his rejoicing, \"I have had  more sweeping, brushing, and cleaning, than in forty years before.  My workmen looke like him they call Muldsacke after sweeping of a  chimney.\" An oil painting by Farley in the collection of the Society  of Antiquaries, which we reproduce by permission, shows the houses  built against the cathedral, and blackening it with wreaths of smoke,  to which attention is drawn by this legend across the picture:--      Viewe, O King, howe my wall creepers    Have made mee work for chimney sweepers.\"]           *       *       *       *       *          INDEX    Alfred, King  Altars  Anabaptists  Archdeacons  Architecture of Old St. Paul's  Arthur, Prince of Wales  Athelstan  Augustine  Aulus Plautius  Ave Maria Lane    Barber Surgeons  Barkham, Lord Mayor  Baud, Sir William le  Baynard's Castle  Beaufort, Cardinal  Becket, Archbishop  Becket, Gilbert  Bible, The, in St. Paul's  Bishops of London:--    Mellitus;    Maurice;    Belmeis;    Basset;    Segrave;    Baldock;    Kempe;    Bonner;    Erkenwald;    Fitzhugh;    Braybrooke;    John of Chishull;    Roger Niger;    Wengham;    Fauconbridge;    Theodred;    William the Norman;    Foliot;    Montfort;    Gravesend;    Courtenay;    Ridley;    Grindal;    Sudbury;    Fitzneal;    Henry de Sandwiche;    Northburgh;    Clifford;    Laud;    Stokesley;    Sheldon;    Henchman;    Cranmer;    Ravis;    King.
