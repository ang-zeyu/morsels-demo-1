[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#19)"],[1,"AN OUNCE OF LOYALTY      When the girls of the sophomore class entered their locker-room the next  day they found a notice posted to the effect that a class meeting would be  held after school in the locker-room at which all members were earnestly  requested to be present.    There was considerable speculation as to the object of the meeting, and no  one knew who had posted the notice. Grace kept her own counsel. She wished  to take the class by surprise, and thus make Anne's restoration to favor  complete.    At recess Nora and Jessica brought up the subject, but found that Grace  apparently wished to avoid talking about it.    \"You'll attend, won't you, Grace?\" asked Anne.    \"Of course,\" said Grace hastily. \"Will you excuse me, girls? I have a  theorem to study.\"    She felt that if she stayed a minute longer she would tell her friends the  good news and spoil her surprise.    \"What makes Grace act so queerly to-day?\" said Jessica. \"I believe she  knows something and won't tell us.\"    \"I'll make her tell it,\" said Nora, and ran after Grace. But just then the  gong sounded and recess was over.    As soon as school was dismissed for the day, the entire sophomore class  crowded into the locker-room. They were curious to know what was in the  wind. Every member was present, and Grace felt a secret satisfaction when  Miriam Nesbit, looking rather bored, sauntered in.    There was a confused murmur of voices. The girls chattered gayly to each  other, as they waited for some one to call the meeting to order. When  Grace left the corner where she had been standing with her three friends,  and stood facing her classmates, the talking instantly ceased.    \"Girls,\" she said, \"I suppose you wonder who called this meeting, and why  it was called? I wrote the notice you all read this morning. I have  something to tell you which I hope you will be glad to hear.\"    \"At the beginning of the school year, some things happened that caused  unpleasant suspicions to rest upon a member of our class. You all know who  I mean. It has caused her and her friends a great deal of unhappiness, and  I am glad to be able at last to bring you the proof that she has been  misjudged.\"    Grace paused and looked about her. She noted that Miriam had turned very  pale.    \"Just as I suspected,\" thought Grace, \"she really did have a hand in that  signal affair.\"    Then she continued.    \"A few days ago I had occasion to call upon the junior captain, Miss  Crosby. While there, she assured me that the juniors did receive our  signals, but that Miss Pierson had absolutely nothing to do with the  matter. I was not sure that you would care to take my word, alone, for  this\"--Grace couldn't resist this one tiny thrust--\"so she very kindly  gave me the assurance in writing, signed by herself.\"    Grace then unfolded the paper and in a clear voice read Julia's statement.    There was not a sound in the room. Grace stood waiting. She had done her  part, the rest lay with her classmates.    Nora and Jessica had their arms around Anne, who had begun to cry quietly.  The relief was so great that it had unnerved her. Then Marian Barber  sprang to Grace's side and seized her by the hand.    \"Listen, girls,\" she cried, \"I want to acknowledge for the second time  that I am heartily ashamed of myself. We have all been nasty and  suspicious toward Anne. We never gave her a chance to defend herself, we  just went ahead and behaved like a lot of silly children. I am sorry for  anything I have ever said about her, and I want to tell you right here  that I consider Grace Harlowe the ideal type of High School girl. I only  wish I were half as noble and courageous. I suppose you all wonder why  Grace went to see Julia Crosby. Well I'll tell you. I found out about it  from Julia's sister this morning.\"    \"Oh Marian, please don't,\" begged Grace, rosy with confusion.    But the girls cried in chorus, \"Tell us, Marian! Don't mind Grace!\"    When Marian had finished many of the girls were in tears. They crowded  around Anne and Grace vying with each other in trying to show their good  will. Then Eva Allen proposed three cheers for Grace and Anne.    They were given with a will. The noise of the ovation bringing one of the  teachers to the door with the severe injunction, \"Young ladies please  contain yourselves. There is too much noise here.\"    The girls dispersed by twos and threes, until Marian Barber and the chums  were the only ones left.    \"I have a motto,\" said Marian, \"that I shall bring here to-morrow and hang  in the locker-room. If I had paid more attention to it it would have been  better for me.\"    \"What is it, Marian?\" asked Jessica.    \"Wait and see,\" replied Marian. \"Oh, it's a good one, and appropriate,  too.\"    After saying good-bye to Marian the four chums walked on together.    \"Are you happy, Anne, dear?\" said Grace, slipping her hand into Anne's.    Anne looked up at Grace with a smile so full of love and gratitude that  Grace felt well repaid for all she had endured for friendship's sake.    \"Everything has turned out just like the last chapter in a book,\" sighed  Nora with satisfaction \"The sinner--that's Julia Crosby--has repented, and  the truly good people--Anne and Grace--have triumphed and will live happy  forever after.\"    The girls laughed at Nora's remark.    \"Now I can go on planning for our big game without being afraid that the  girls will stay away from practice and do things to annoy and make it hard  for me,\" said Grace happily. \"I know that we shall win. I feel so full of  enthusiasm I don't know what to do. Oh, girls, I forgot to tell you that  Julia Crosby and I have a perfectly splendid plan. But I promised not to  say anything to anyone about it until she comes back to school.\"    \"How funny it sounds to hear you talk about having plans with Julia  Crosby,\" said Jessica laughing. \"You will make Miriam Nesbit jealous if  you take Julia away from her.\"    \"By the way, girls!\" exclaimed Nora, \"what became of Miriam? I saw her  enter the locker-room, but she wasn't there when Marian Barber began her  speech. I know she did not remain, because I looked for her and couldn't  find her.\"    \"I saw her go,\" said Grace quietly, \"That is the only part of this story  that doesn't end well. She doesn't like Anne or me any better than before  and never will, I'm afraid. She influenced the girls against us, after the  first game, and you remember what she said at the basketball meeting,  don't you, Nora?\"    \"Yes,\" responded Nora, \"I do, and if she hadn't been David's sister I  would have told her a few plain truths, then and there.\"    \"I said at the beginning of the year that I believed Miriam had a better  self,\" said Grace thoughtfully. \"I still believe it, and I am not going to  give her up yet.\"    \"I don't envy you the task of finding it,\" said Jessica.    \"I wonder what Marian Barber's motto is?\" mused Anne. \"She said it would  be a good one.\"    \"I have no doubt of that. Marian Barber doesn't usually do things by  halves when once she starts,\" said Jessica. \"I am surprised that she ever  allowed herself to be drawn into Miriam's net. She seems awfully sorry for  it now.\"    \"Oh, girls,\" cried Nora suddenly. \"I have a half a dollar.\"    \"Really?\" said Jessica. \"I didn't suppose there was that much money in  Oakdale.\"    \"My sister gave it to me this morning,\" Nora went on, ignoring Jessica's  remark. \"I am supposed to buy a new collar with it, but if you are  thirsty----\"    \"I am simply perishing with thirst,\" murmured Grace.    Five minutes later the four girls were seated in the nearest drug store  busily engaged with hot chocolate, while they congratulated Nora on having  spent her money in a good cause.    The sophomores smiled to themselves next morning at Marian's motto. It  hung in a prominent place in the locker-room and read: \"An ounce of  loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness.\"          CHAPTER XVII    BURYING THE HATCHET      It was some days before Julia Crosby was able to return to school, but  when she did put in an appearance, she lost no time in taking her class in  hand and bringing about a much-needed reform. The part played by Grace  Harlowe in Julia's rescue had been related by her to various classmates  who had visited her during her illness, and Grace found that the older  girls were inclined to lionize her more than she cared to be. She received  praise enough to have completely turned her head had she not been too  sensible to allow it to do so.    After holding a conference with Julia, the two girls sent out notices to  their respective classes that a grand reunion of the two classes would  take place on the next Saturday afternoon at one o'clock, at the old  Omnibus House, providing the weather permitted. A tax of twenty-five cents  apiece was levied on the members of both classes. \"Please pay your money  promptly to the treasurer of your class,\" ended the notices, \"if you wish  to have plenty to eat. Important rites and ceremonies will be observed.  You will be sorry if you stay away, as an interesting program is  promised. Please keep this notice a secret.\"    \"The field back of the Omnibus House is an ideal place for the burial,\"  Julia told Grace. \"It was there that the 'Black Monks of Asia' held their  revel and were unmasked by the freshmen. Besides, it's quiet and we shan't  be disturbed.\"    Grace agreed with her, and the two girls outlined the proceedings with  many a chuckle.    The junior and sophomore classes had been requested to go directly to the  Omnibus House.    \"It would be great to have both classes march out there, but we should  have the whole of Oakdale marching with us before we arrived at the sacred  spot,\" observed Grace, with a giggle.    \"If we don't have a lot of freshmen to suppress it will be surprising. I  do hope the girls haven't told anyone,\" Julia answered. \"By the way, we  have a hatchet at home that will be just the thing to bury. It is more  like a battle-ax "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15353"],[0,"A First Spanish Reader (#19)"],[1," =continuar,= (_pres._ continuo), to continue.    =continuo,-a,= continuous.    =contorno,= _m_., district.    =contra,= against.    =convencer,= to convince.    =convencido,= _p.p. of_ convencer.    =conveniencia,= _f._, convenience.    =convenir, (ie),= to suit; (_see_ =venir=).    =conversacion,= _f._, conversation.    =conversar,= to converse.    =convertirse,= (ie), to change.    =conviene,= _pres. of_ convenir.    =copia,= _f_., copy.    =copiar,= to copy.    =copo,= _m_., bunch of flax.    =Coran,= _m_., the Koran.    =corazon,= _m_., heart.    =cordero,= _m_., lamb.    =cordial=, cordial.    =cordon=, _m._, string; belt, cord.    =coro=, _m._, chorus; choir.    =corona=, _f._, crown.    =coronel=, _m._, colonel.    =corpulento,-a=, corpulent, fat.    =correcto,-a=, correct.    =correr=, to run.    =corresponder=, to fall to the share of.    =corrida=, _f._, bullfight.    =cortar=, to cut; cut down,    =corte=, _f._, court.    =corte=, _m._, edge (of a knife).    =cortes=, courteous, polite.    =cortesano=, _m._, courtier.    =cortesia=, _f._, courtesy.    =corto,-a=, short.    =Coruna (la)=, a province and city of northwestern Spain.    =cosa=, _f._, thing; matter; =---- rara=, wonder.    =cosecha=, _f._, harvest.    =cosechar=, to reap, harvest,    =costa=, _f._, coast.    =costar, (ue)=, to cost.    =costo=, _m._, cost.    =costumbre=, _f._, custom, habit; _pl._, manners.    =craneo=, _m._, cranium, skull.    =crecer=, (_pres._ =crezco=), grow.    =crecido,-a=, increased.    =creer=, (_pres. part._ =creyendo=), to believe; think.    =cresta=, _f._, crest.    =creyendo=, _pres. part. of_ =creer=.    =creyente=, _m._, believer, faithful.    =creyera=, _past subj., first form, of_ =creer=.    =creyo=, _past abs. of_ =creer=.    =cria=, _f._, raising; brood.    =criada=, _f._, servant, maid.    =criadero=, _m._, breeding place.    =criado=, _m._, servant.    =criar=, to beget; raise, bring up.    =cristal=, _m._, crystal, cut glass.    =cristaleria=, _f._, glass, glassware.    =cristiano,-a=, Christian.    =cuaderno=, _m._, copy book.    =cuadrado,-a=, square.    =cuadro=, _m._, picture; painting.    =cual=, which; =el ----=, who, which; =lo ----=,    what; =cada ----=, each one.    =?cual?= what? which?    =cualquier=, any, whatsoever.    =cualquiera=, whoever.    =cuando=, when.    =?cuando?= when?    =cuanto,-a=, as much as; all that; =---- mas..., tanto mas=,    the..., the; =en ---- a=, concerning, regarding;    =en ----=, as soon as.    =?cuanto,-a?= how much? how many?    =cuarenta,= forty.    =cuarto,-a,= fourth, quarter.    =cuarto,= _m._, room.    =cuatro,= four.    =cubierta,= _f._, covering.    =cubrir,= (_p.p._ cubierto), to cover.    =cuchillo,= _m._, knife.    =cuelo,= _pres. of_ =colar(se).=    =cuello,= _m_., neck.    =cuenta,= _f._, bill.    =cuento,= _pres. of_ =contar.=    =cuento,= _m._, story, tale.    =cuerdo,-a,= wise.    =cuerno,= _m._, horn (of an animal).    =cuero,= _m._, leather, pelt.    =cuerpo,= _m._, body.    =cuesta,= _f._, hillside, slope; =---- arriba,= uphill.    =---- abajo,= downhill.    =cuestan,= _pres.of_ =costar.=    =cuestion,= _f._, question.    =cuidado,= _m._, care; =tener ----=, to be careful;    =ino tengas ----!=, don't worry!
