To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#19)"],[1,"to reward Mehemet for all his services, and also doubtless  desirous of a still closer connection, the aged Tchorbadji married him  to his daughter. This was the beginning of the young man's success; he  was then eighteen years old. Dealings with a French merchant of Cavala  had inspired him with a taste for commerce, and, devoting himself to it,  he speculated with much success, chiefly in tobacco, the richest product  of his country.    This period of his life was not without its influence upon Egypt, for we  know how strenuously the pasha endeavoured to develop the commercial and  manufacturing industries.    The French invasion surprised him in the midst of these peaceful  occupations. The Porte, having raised an army in Macedonia, ordered the  Tchorbadji to furnish a contingent of three hundred men, who entrusted  the command of this small force to his son Ali Agha, appointing Mehemet  Ali, whose merit and courage he fully appreciated, as his lieutenant.  The Macedonain recruits rejoined the forces of the pasha-captain, and  landed with the grand vizier at Abukir, where was fought that battle  which resulted in victory for France and the complete defeat of the  sultan's army. Completely demoralised by this overthrow, Ali Agha left  Mehemet Ali in command of his troops, and quitted the army.    It is well to consider in a brief survey the state of the country at  the moment when the incapacity of General Menou compelled the French to  withdraw from Egypt. Arrayed against each other were the troops of the  sultan, numbering four thousand Albanians and those forces sent from  England under the command of Admiral Keith, on one side; and on the  other were the Mamluks striving for supremacy; and it was a question  whether this powerful force would once more rule Egypt as before the  French invasion, or whether the country would again fall under the  dominion of the Porte.    There was occasion for anxiety among the Mamluks themselves; their  two principal beys, Osman-Bardisi and Muhammed el-Elfi, instead of  strengthening their forces by acting in concert, as Murad Bey and  Ibrahim Bey had done before the French occupation, permitted their  rivalry for power so completely to absorb them that it was finally the  means of encompassing their ruin and that of their party.    The first pasha invested with the viceroyalty of Egypt after the  departure of the French troops was Muhammed Khusurf, who faithfully  served the Porte. His government was able and zealous, but the  measures he employed against his haughty antagonists lacked the lofty  intelligence indispensable to so difficult a task. Muhammed Khusurf,  whose rivalry with Mehemet Ali had for some years attracted European  attention, found himself at last face to face with his future opponent.    Mehemet Ali, by dint of hard work and the many important services  rendered to his country, had passed through successive stages of  promotion to the rank of serchime, which gave him the command of three  or four thousand Albanians. Foreseeing his opportunity, he had employed  himself in secretly strengthening his influence over his subordinates;  he allied himself with the Mam-luks, opened the gates of Cairo to them,  and, joining Osman-Bardisi, marched against Khusurf. He pursued the  viceroy to Damietta, taking possession of the town, conducted his  prisoner to Cairo, where he placed him in the custody of the aged  Ibrahim Bey, the Nestor of the Mamluks (1803).    At this moment, the second Mamluk bey, Muhammed el-Elfi, returned from  England, whither he had accompanied the British to demand protection  when they evacuated Alexandria in March of the same year, and landed  at Abukir. This arrival filled Bardisi with the gravest anxiety, for  Muhammed el-Elfi was his equal in station, and would share his power  even if he did not deprive him of the position he had recently acquired  through his own efforts. These fears were but too well founded. Whilst  Bardisi was securing his position by warfare, el-Elfi had gained the  protection of England, and, as its price, had pledged himself to much  that would compromise the future of Egypt.    Far from openly joining one or other of the rival parties, Mehemet Ali  contented himself with fanning the flame of their rivalry. The rank  of Albanian captain, which gave him the air of a subaltern, greatly  facilitated the part he intended to play. He worked quietly and with  unending perseverance. Flattering the ambitions of some, feeding  the resentment of others, winning the weak-minded with soft words,  overcoming the strong by his own strength; presiding over all the  revolutions in Cairo, upholding the cause of the pashas when the Mamluks  needed support, and, when the pasha had acquired a certain amount of  power, uniting himself with the Mamluk against his allies of yesterday;  above all, neglecting nothing which could secure him the support of the  people, and making use for this end of the sheikhs and Oulemas, whom  he conciliated, some by religious appearances, others by his apparent  desire for the public good, he thus maintained his position during the  numerous changes brought about by the respective parties.    At length, in the beginning of March, 1805, as the people were beginning  to weary of disturbances as violent as they were frequent, Mehemet Ali  promised the sheikhs to restore peace and order if they would assure him  their co-operation and influence. He then incited a revolt against the  Oulemas, besieged Kourshyd Pasha in the citadel, made himself master of  Cairo in the space of a few days, and finished his work by expelling  the Mamluks. The Albanians and Oulemas, completely carried away by his  valour and manouvres, proclaimed him pasha immediately. Always prudent,  and anxious to establish his claims upon the favour of the Porte,  Mehemet Ali feigned to refuse. After considerable hesitation, which  gave way before some costly gifts, or possibly on consideration of the  difficulties hitherto experienced in establishing the authority of the  pashas, the Turkish government determined to confirm the choice of  the Egyptian people. Mehemet Ali received, therefore, the firman of  investiture on July 9,1805; but during the ensuing seven months he  governed in Lower Egypt only, Alexandria still being under the authority  of an officer delegated by the sultan. As for Upper Egypt, it had  remained the appanage of the Mamluk beys, who had contrived to retain  possession of the Said.    Mehemet Ali had no sooner been proclaimed than Elfi, who had reorganised  his party in Upper Egypt, did all in his power to overthrow the  new pasha. He first offered to assist Kourshyd to regain his former  position; he promised his allegiance to the Porte on condition of the  dismissal of Mehemet Ali, and then turned his attention to England. He  found difficulty in obtaining her concurrence by promising to give up  the chief ports of Egypt. These negotiations, suspended the first time  by M. Dro-vetti, the French consul at Alexandria, co-operating with the  pasha, were again renewed some time after through the influence of  the English ambassador, who, in the name of his country, demanded the  re-establishment of the Mamluks, guaranteeing the fidelity of Elfi. The  Porte at once sent a fleet to Egypt bearing a firman, appointing Mehemet  Ali to the pashalic of Salonica. At this juncture, the viceroy, feeling  sure of the support of the sheikhs, who had assisted him to his present  position, only sought to temporise. He soon received the further  support of the Mamluk beys of Bardisi's party, who forgot their personal  grievances in the desire to be revenged upon the common foe; at the same  time, twenty-five French Mamluks, urged thereto by M. Drovetti, deserted  the ranks of Elfi's adherents and joined Mehemet Ali.    The Pasha of Egypt possessed a zealous partisan in the French ambassador  at Constantinople. The latter, perceiving that the secession of  the Mamluks made the regaining of their former power an absolute  impossibility, pleaded the cause of Mehemet Ali with the Porte, and  obtained a firman re-establishing his viceroyalty, on condition of his  payment of an annual tribute of about $1,000,000.    The power of Mehemet Ali was beginning to be more firmly established,  and the almost simultaneous deaths of Osman-Bardisi and Muhammed el-Elfi  (November, 1806, and January, 1807) seemed to promise a peaceful future,  when, on March 17th, the English, displeased at his reconciliation with  the Porte, arrived in Egypt. Their forces numbered some seven or eight  thousand men, and it was the intention to stir up the Mamluks and  render them every assistance. A detachment of the English forces, led  by General Fraser, took possession of Alexandria, which the English  occupied for six months without being able to attempt any other  enterprise. The remainder of the troops were cut to pieces at Rosetta by  a small contingent of Albanians: thus ended the expedition. The viceroy,  who at the beginning of the campaign had displayed really Oriental  cruelty, and sent more than a thousand heads of English soldiers to  Cairo to decorate Rumlieh, finished his operations by an act of European  generosity, and delivered up his prisoners without demanding ransom. The  plan of defence adopted by the pasha was the work of Drovetti, to whom,  consequently, is due some of the glory of this rapid triumph.    Mehemet Ali, having nothing further to fear from the English, who  evacuated Egypt in September, 1807, began to give scope to his ambitious  schemes, when the easily disturbed policy of the Porte saw fit to send  the wily pasha against the Wahabis, who threatened to invade the Holy  Places. Before obeying these injunctions, the viceroy deemed it wise,  previous to engaging in a campaign so perilous, to ensure Egypt against  the dangers with which, in the absence of the forces, she would be  menaced.

He was locked in his room at the Evans  Hotel while a committee secreted the head of a gold pin in the cave. On  their return, after being blindfolded, he led them to the livery stable,  and securing a team drove to the cave and found the pin in the Standing  Rock Chamber, beyond the Pearly Gates, and then drove back to the city  still blindfolded.    \"Down one short flight of stairs and we are in the Waiting Room, so  called on account of persons waiting here while the rest of their party  finished the trip by climbing up the Alpine Way. This difficult climb  was made until the route was developed via the Marble Quarry. A steep  pathway and one flight of stairs now bring us to the Ticket Office, and  another short stairway leads into the room above, which is the Fair  Grounds. We enter the right wing, which measures two hundred and six  links in length and forty-nine in width at the narrowest place. We are  now in the third level and no box work is seen, but the ceiling (which  is low) shows many interesting fossils. The central dome is some fifty  feet in height, and passing to the right the guide seats the party in  such a position that the frost work on the wall can be seen to  advantage. This is the largest part of the Fair Grounds and measures six  hundred and forty-five links long, exclusive of the right wing, and has  a width of fifty-three links, which with a number of wings added, makes  it one of the largest under-ground rooms within American caverns.    \"A great many visitors look at their cuff-buttons when told we have  twenty-five hundred rooms included in ninety-seven miles of passageways.  Of course they do not understand how we get the mileage. In going to the  Fair Grounds we travel about three miles. In each fissure there are  eight levels, which makes twenty-four miles of cave from the entrance to  the Fair Grounds.    \"Of the formations in the cave, the different kinds are on different  levels, the stalactites and stalagmites nearest the surface on the  second, the frost work on the third. This formation is in most instances  as colorless as snow. The mode of its formation is not thoroughly  understood, but is found in such positions as suggest its being formed  by vapors overcharged as spoken of about the water. It is almost always  on an over-hanging rock, over or near some fissure leading to a deeper  portion of the cave. Box work in this level is scattering and fragile:  in the fourth it is the prevailing formation: in the fifth it is heavier  and a little darker; in the sixth it varies in style and color, and  pop-corn appears, a queer formation resembling pop-corn ready to eat. It  is not so purely white here as in the lower levels, seventh and eighth.  In the seventh the box work is heavier than any seen on the Fair  Grounds' Route and the color is nearly blue, having a faded appearance.  In this tier is also found a good deal of mineral wool, which must not  be mistaken for asbestos. It sometimes attains a length of eighteen  inches and at one place where it seems to come out of a hole two inches  in diameter, and drops down like a grey beard, we have named it Noah's  Beard.    \"In the eighth tier we find very beautiful formations of carbonate of  lime, and the box work is decidedly blue, the boxes larger, and their  partitions one half inch thick.    \"We have been deeper than the eighth tier but in narrow crevices barely  admitting a man of average stature. In these the calcareous coating is  much thicker than in any higher portions of the cave, but very little  sign of box work is seen.    \"Sometimes we make a comparison between the cave and a sponge. Take for  instance a sponge as large as an apple barrel and there would be holes  in it as big as a man's thumb and closed hand. Now take a sponge, four  miles square and five hundred feet deep with holes in proportion to the  little sponge, and you have an illustration of The Wonderful Wind Cave,  of Custer County, South Dakota.\"          CHAPTER XI.    WIND CAVE CONTINUED.      PEARLY GATES AND BLUE GROTTO ROUTE.    A very much longer, more beautiful, and also more difficult journey than  the one just described may be taken by those in whom the desire to see  is greater than the fear of fatigue, or possibly, some little danger.  With this object in view the Fair Grounds' Route is followed through  Monte Cristo's Palace and into Milliner's Avenue. Here we leave it by  dropping off the bridge into a rough hole, which proves to be a passage  descending into Castle Garden directly beneath the Avenue, and a room of  considerable size, plentifully supplied with bowlders. Although  interesting to visit, it has no points of such special merit as would  seem to require a detailed account, the main importance attaching to it  being the fact that it is the first portion of the eighth level visited.  A little beyond, however, is something quite new. The floor is covered  with a light yellow crust of calcite crystal, sufficiently strong to  bear the weight of a limited number of guests without much fracture. It  generally gives a hollow sound when struck, which is easily accounted  for as there are small holes noticed by which steam evidently made its  escape, and through these cavities can be seen but they are shallow. One  place shows the crust broken up and with the edges of the pieces  overlapped, like ice broken by a sudden rise of back-water, and in this  position they have been firmly cemented.    This is where the slowly receding waters of the cave lingered in shallow  pools above the small crevices long after the main portions had become  dry. That the crust was formed on top of the water, instead of beneath  its surface, has been proved by the only body of water now standing in  the cave. This is called Silent Lake, and being situated on another  route will be described in its proper place, but when discovered no  water was visible nor its presence even suspected until the crust gave  way under the weight of an explorer. The thin sheet of yellow calcite  crystal thus broken was the same as that seen in great abundance in the  now perfectly dry eighth level. The gradually decreasing volume of water  has left a smooth yellow coat on portions of the walls where  irregularities or slopes were favorable, and at least one such place is  vividly remembered if once seen. A steep incline of about fifteen feet  leads to a small oval hole through the wall; towards this we crawled  with no great ease; but getting to the hole was far easier than going  through it into a tiny cubby not high enough to sit comfortably upright  in, and too small to permit an average sized human being to turn around.  Close on the left it is shut in by another wall pierced by two holes  similar to that just passed, and each revealing a miniature chamber  scarcely more than three feet in either direction and eighteen inches  high. Being directed to examine the ceiling of the first, it was done  with some difficulty and much satisfaction, for there in the center was  a most exquisite bit of art work, a circular disk of \"drusy\" quartz  about twelve inches in diameter and having the appearance of a flat  rosette of fine black lace, in open pattern with small diamonds thickly  strung on every thread; a brilliant, sparkling mass of gems. After Mr.  McDonald had carefully removed a geode from the other little chamber, he  slid down into a fourth, the last of the diminutive suite, having  sufficient height to allow a sitting posture with raised head, and  opened the small jewel case, while I examined the place it came from.  Here all was calcite crystal heavily massed in various forms, and a  harmony of blue and brown, with half a dozen round, unbroken, perfect  geodes hanging from the ceiling like oriole nests. The geode taken  proved on opening to be especially fine, being filled with pearly white  calcite crystals of both the dog-tooth and nail-head forms, and was  kindly presented to be added to the collection of cave specimens already  purchased in town, to which were also added handsome pieces of \"drusy\"  quartz, cave coral, and tufa and mineral wool.    Following the guide I now slipped down into the larger nook just  vacated, and saw with considerable chagrin that the next step was down a  perpendicular wall more than ten feet in height, facing a high, narrow  fissure, the floor of which was merely two shelves sloping to an open  space along the middle, almost two feet wide, with the darkness of  continuing crevice below. Further progress seemed absolutely impossible.  All things are, however, possible to those who will, and it had been  willed to pay a visit to the grandest portion of Wind Cave. In order to  do so the descent must be made and was. Then some little distance must  be traveled along the crevice, but the angle of elevation taken by both  sides of the bisected floor served as a sort of prohibitory tax together  with the calcite paving, since to maintain an upright position on such a  surface would require long training of a certain professional character.  That difficulty, too, was overcome by placing a foot on either side of  the open crevice; the first consideration, of course, being safety and  not grace.    We now came to the enjoyment of the reward of merit. Flooded with the  brilliant white light of magnesium ribbon, the crevice walls could be  seen drawing together at a height of sixty-five feet, and both composed  entirely of larger box work than any seen before and very heavily  covered with calcite crystal, colored a bright electric blue and glowing  with a pearly lustre. This is the Centennial Gallery, and leaving it  with reluctance we passed on into the Blue Grotto to find it finer  still. It is somewhat wider and higher, while even the extremely rough,  uneven floor shows no spot bare of heavy box work of a yet deeper blue.    The wonderful beauty of "]]]
