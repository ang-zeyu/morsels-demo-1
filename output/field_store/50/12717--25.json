There are left but the remnants of the  surrounding wall, and the ruins of the three principal buildings, which  were the envy and wonder of all the civilized world.    The beautiful little temple of Athena Nike, tho outside the  Propylaea--thrust out as it were on a sort of great buttress high on the  right--must still be called a part, and a very striking part, of the  Acropolis. It is only of late years that it has been cleared of rubbish  and modern stone-work, thus destroying, no doubt, some precious traces  of Turkish occupation which the fastidious historian may regret, but  realizing to us a beautiful Greek temple of the Ionic Order in some  completeness. The peculiarity of this building, which is perched upon a  platform of stone, and commands a splendid prospect, is that its tiny  peribolus, or sacred enclosure, was surrounded by a parapet of stone  slabs covered with exquisite reliefs of winged Victories, in various  attitudes. Some of these slabs are now in the Museum of the Acropolis,  and are of great interest--apparently less severe than the school of  Phidias, and therefore later in date, but still of the best epoch, and  of marvelous grace. The position of this temple also is not parallel  with the Propylaea, but turned slightly outward, so that the light  strikes it at moments when the other building is not illuminated. At the  opposite side is a very well-preserved chamber, and a fine colonnade at  right angles with the gate, which looks like a guard-room. This is the  chamber commonly called the Pinacotheca, where Pausanias saw pictures or  frescoes by Polygnotus.          A WINTER IN ATHENS HALF A CENTURY AGO[43]    BY BAYARD TAYLOR      Our sitting-room fronted the south (with a view of the Acropolis and the  Areopagus), and could be kept warm without more labor or expense than  would be required for an entire dwelling at home. Our principal anxiety  was, that the supply of fuel, at any price, might become exhausted. We  burned the olive and the vine, the cypress and the pine, twigs of rose  trees and dead cabbage-stalks, for aught I know, to feed our one little  sheet-iron stove. For full two months we were obliged to keep up our  fire, from morning until night. Know ye the land of the cypress and  myrtle, where the flowers ever blossom, the beams ever shine? Here it  is, with almost snow enough in the streets for a sleighing party, with  the Ilissus frozen, and with a tolerable idea of Lapland, when you face  the gusts which drive across the Cephissian plain.    As the other guests were Greek, our mode of living was similar to that  of most Greek families. We had coffee in the morning, a substantial  breakfast about noon, and dinner at six in the evening. The dishes were  constructed after French and Italian models, but the meat is mostly  goat's flesh. Beef, when it appears, is a phenomenon of toughness.  Vegetables are rather scarce. Cow's milk, and butter or cheese  therefrom, are substances unknown in Greece. The milk is from goats or  sheep, and the butter generally from the latter. It is a white, cheesy  material, with a slight flavor of tallow. The wine, when you get it  unmixed with resin, is very palatable. We drank that of Santorin, with  the addition of a little water, and found it an excellent beverage....    Except during the severely cold weather, Athens is as lively a town as  may be. One-fourth of the inhabitants, I should say, are always in the  streets, and many of the mechanics work, as is common in the Orient, in  open shops. The coffee-houses are always thronged, and every afternoon  crowds may be seen on the Patissia Road--a continuation of Eolus  Street--where the King and Queen take their daily exercise on horseback.  The national costume, both male and female, is gradually falling into  disuse in the cities, altho it is still universal in the country. The  islanders adhere to their hideous dress with the greatest persistence.  With sunrise the country people begin to appear in the streets with  laden donkeys and donkey-carts, bringing wood, grain, vegetables, and  milk, which they sell from house to house....    Venders of bread and coffee-rolls go about with circular trays on their  heads, calling attention to their wares by loud and long-drawn cries.  Later in the day, peddlers make their appearance, with packages of cheap  cotton stuffs, cloth, handkerchiefs, and the like, or baskets of pins,  needles, buttons, and tape. They proclaim loudly the character and price  of their articles, the latter, of course, subject to negotiation. The  same custom prevails as in Turkey, of demanding much more than the  seller expects to get. Foreigners are generally fleeced a little in the  beginning, tho much less so, I believe, than in Italy....    The winter of 1857-58 was the severest in the memory of any inhabitant.  For nearly eight weeks, we had an alternation of icy north winds and  snow-storms. The thermometer went down to 20 degrees of Fahrenheit--a  degree of cold which seriously affected the orange-, if not the  olive-trees. Winter is never so dreary as in those southern lands, where  you see the palm trees rocking despairingly in the biting gale, and the  snow lying thick on the sunny fruit of the orange groves. As for the  pepper trees, with their hanging tresses and their loose, misty foliage,  which line the broad avenues radiating from the palace, they were  touched beyond recovery. The people, who could not afford to purchase  wood or charcoal, at treble the usual price, even tho they had hearths,  which they have not, suffered greatly. They crouched at home, in cellars  and basements, wrapt in rough capotes, or hovering around a mangal, or  brazier of coals, the usual substitute for a stove. From Constantinople  we had still worse accounts. The snow lay deep everywhere; charcoal sold  at twelve piastres the oka (twenty cents a pound), and the famished  wolves, descending from the hills, devoured people almost at the gates  of the city. In Smyrna, Beyrout, and Alexandria, the winter was equally  severe, while in Odessa it was mild and agreeable, and in St.  Petersburg there was scarcely snow enough for sleighing. All Northern  Europe enjoyed a winter as remarkable for warmth as that of the South  for its cold. The line of division seemed to be about the parallel of  latitude 45 degrees. Whether this singular climatic phenomenon extended  further eastward, into Asia, I was not able to ascertain. I was actually  less sensitive to the cold in Lapland, during the previous winter, with  the mercury frozen, than in Attica, within the belt of semi-tropical  productions.          THE ACROPOLIS AS IT WAS[44]    BY PAUSANIAS      To the Acropolis there is only one approach; it allows of no other,  being everywhere precipitous and walled off. The vestibules have a roof  of white marble, and even now are remarkable for both their beauty and  size. As to the statues of the horsemen, I can not say with precision  whether they are the sons of Xenophon, or merely put there for  decoration. On the right of the vestibules is the shrine of the Wingless  Victory. From it the sea is visible; and there AEgeus drowned himself, as  they say. For the ship which took his sons to Crete had black sails, but  Theseus told his father (for he knew there was some peril in attacking  the Minotaur) that he would have white sails if he should sail back a  conqueror. But he forgot this promise in his loss of Ariadne. And AEgeus,  seeing the ship with black sails, thinking his son was dead, threw  himself in and was drowned. And the Athenians have a hero-chapel to his  memory. And on the left of the vestibules is a building with paintings;  and among those that time has not destroyed are Diomedes and  Odysseus--the one taking away Philoctetes's bow in Lemnos, the other  taking the Palladium from Ilium. Among other paintings here is AEgisthus  being slain by Orestes; and Pylades slaying the sons of Nauplius that  came to AEgisthus's aid. And Polyxena about to have her throat cut near  the tomb of Achilles. Homer did well not to mention this savage act....    And there is a small stone such as a little man can sit on, on which  they say Silenus rested, when Dionysus came to the land. Silenus is the  name they give to all old Satyrs. About the Satyrs I have conversed with  many, wishing to know all about them. And Euphemus, a Carian, told me  that sailing once on a time to Italy he was driven out of his course by  the winds, and carried to a distant sea, where people no longer sail.  And he said that here were many desert islands, some inhabited by wild  men; and at these islands the sailors did not like to land, as they had  landed there before and had experience of the natives; but they were  obliged on that occasion. These islands he said were called by the  sailors Satyr-islands; the dwellers in them were red-haired, and had  tails at their loins not much smaller than horses....    And as regards the temple which they call the Parthenon, as you enter it  everything portrayed on the gables relates to the birth of Athene, and  behind is depicted the contest between Poseidon and Athene for the soil  of Attica. And this work of art is in ivory and gold. In the middle of  her helmet is an image of the Sphinx--about whom I shall give an account  when I come to Boeotia--and on each side of the helmet are griffins  worked. These griffins, says Aristus the Proconnesian, in his poems,  fought with the Arimaspians beyond the Issedones for the gold of the  soil which the griffins guarded. And the Arimaspians were all one-eyed  men from their birth; and the griffins were beasts like lions, with  wings and mouth like an eagle. Let so much suffice for these griffins.  But the statue of Athene is full length, with a tunic reaching to her  feet; and on her breast is the head of Medusa worked in ivory, and in  one hand she has a Victory four cubits high, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#19)"],[1,"rince. What good shall I be to you if you land me? I shall  not taste well; so put me back into the water again, and let me swim  away.\"    \"Well,\" said the fisherman, \"no need of so many words about the matter,  as you can speak I had much rather let you swim away.\"    Then he put him back into the clear water, and the flounder sank to the  bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him. Then the fisherman  got up and went home to his wife in their hovel.    \"Well, husband,\" said the wife, \"have you caught nothing to-day?\"    \"No,\" said the man--\"that is, I did catch a flounder, but as he said he  was an enchanted prince, I let him go again.\"    \"Then, did you wish for nothing?\" said the wife.    \"No,\" said the man; \"what should I wish for?\"    \"Oh dear!\" said the wife; \"and it is so dreadful always to live in this  evil-smelling hovel; you might as well have wished for a little cottage;  go again and call him; tell him we want a little cottage, I daresay he  will give it us; go, and be quick.\"    And when he went back, the sea was green and yellow, and not nearly so  clear. So he stood and said,        \"O man, O man!--if man you be,      Or flounder, flounder, in the sea--      Such a tiresome wife I've got,      For she wants what I do not.\"    Then the flounder came swimming up, and said,    \"Now then, what does she want?\"    \"Oh,\" said the man, \"you know when I caught you my wife says I ought to  have wished for something. She does not want to live any longer in the  hovel, and would rather have a cottage.    \"Go home with you,\" said the flounder, \"she has it already.\"    So the man went home, and found, instead of the hovel, a little cottage,  and his wife was sitting on a bench before the door. And she took him by  the hand, and said to him,    \"Come in and see if this is not a great improvement.\"    So they went in, and there was a little house-place and a beautiful  little bedroom, a kitchen and larder, with all sorts of furniture, and  iron and brass ware of the very best. And at the back was a little yard  with fowls and ducks, and a little garden full of green vegetables and  fruit.    \"Look,\" said the wife, \"is not that nice?\"    \"Yes,\" said the man, \"if this can only last we shall be very well  contented.\"    \"We will see about that,\" said the wife. And after a meal they went to  bed.    So all went well for a week or fortnight, when the wife said,    \"Look here, husband, the cottage is really too confined, and the yard  and garden are so small; I think the flounder had better get us a  larger house; I should like very much to live in a large stone castle;  so go to your fish and he will send us a castle.\"    \"O my dear wife,\" said the man, \"the cottage is good enough; what do we  want a castle for?\"    \"We want one,\" said the wife; \"go along with you; the flounder can give  us one.\"    \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"the flounder gave us the cottage; I do not  like to go to him again, he may be angry.\"    \"Go along,\" said the wife, \"he might just as well give us it as not; do  as I say!\"    The man felt very reluctant and unwilling; and he said to himself,    \"It is not the right thing to do;\" nevertheless he went.    So when he came to the seaside, the water was purple and dark blue and  grey and thick, and not green and yellow as before. And he stood and  said,        \"O man, O man!--if man you be,      Or flounder, flounder, in the sea--      Such a tiresome wife I've got,      For she wants what I do not.\"    \"Now then, what does she want?\" said the flounder.    \"Oh,\" said the man, half frightened, \"she wants to live in a large stone  castle.\"    \"Go home with you, she is already standing before the door,\" said the  flounder.    Then the man went home, as he supposed, but when he got there, there  stood in the place of the cottage a great castle of stone, and his wife  was standing on the steps, about to go in; so she took him by the hand,  and said,    \"Let us enter.\"    With that he went in with her, and in the castle was a great hall with a  marble pavement, and there were a great many servants, who led them  through large doors, and the passages were decked with tapestry, and the  rooms with golden chairs and tables, and crystal chandeliers hanging  from the ceiling; and all the rooms had carpets. And the tables were  covered with eatables and the best wine for any one who wanted them. And  at the back of the house was a great stable-yard for horses and cattle,  and carriages of the finest; besides, there was a splendid large garden,  with the most beautiful flowers and fine fruit trees, and a pleasance  full half a mile long, with deer and oxen and sheep, and everything that  heart could wish for.    \"There!\" said the wife, \"is not this beautiful?\"    \"Oh yes,\" said the man, \"if it will only last we can live in this fine  castle and be very well contented.\"    \"We will see about that,\" said the wife, \"in the meanwhile we will sleep  upon it.\" With that they went to bed.    The next morning the wife was awake first, just at the break of day, and  she looked out and saw from her bed the beautiful country lying all  round. The man took no notice of it, so she poked him in the side with  her elbow, and said,    \"Husband, get up and just look out of the window. Look, just think if we  could be king over all this country. Just go to your fish and tell him  we should like to be king.\"    \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what should we be kings for? I don't want to  be king.\"    \"Well,\" said the wife, \"if you don't want to be king, I will be king.\"    \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what do you want to be king for? I could not  ask him such a thing.\"    \"Why not?\" said the wife, \"you must go directly all the same; I must be  king.\"    So the man went, very much put out that his wife should want to be king.    \"It is not the right thing to do--not at all the right thing,\" thought  the man. He did not at all want to go, and yet he went all the same.    And when he came to the sea the water was quite dark grey, and rushed  far inland, and had an ill smell. And he stood and said,        \"O man, O man!--if man you be,      Or flounder, flounder, in the sea--      Such a tiresome wife I've got,      For she wants what I do not.\"    \"Now then, what does she want?\" said the fish.    \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"she wants to be king.\"    \"Go home with you, she is so already,\" said the fish.    So the man went back, and as he came to the palace he saw it was very  much larger, and had great towers and splendid gateways; the herald  stood before the door, and a number of soldiers with kettle-drums and  trumpets.    And when he came inside everything was of marble and gold, and there  were many curtains with great golden tassels. Then he went through the  doors of the saloon to where the great throne-room was, and there was  his wife sitting upon a throne of gold and diamonds, and she had a great  golden crown on, and the sceptre in her hand was of pure gold and  jewels, and on each side stood six pages in a row, each one a head  shorter than the other. So the man went up to her and said,    \"Well, wife, so now you are king!\"    \"Yes,\" said the wife, \"now I am king.\"    So then he stood and looked at her, and when he had gazed at her for  some time he said,    \"Well, wife, this is fine for you to be king! now there is nothing more  to wish for.\"    \"O husband!\" said the wife, seeming quite restless, \"I am tired of this  already. Go to your fish and tell him that now I am king I must be  emperor.\"    \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what do you want to be emperor for?\"    \"Husband,\" said she, \"go and tell the fish I want to be emperor.\"    \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"he could not do it--I cannot ask him such a  thing. There is but one emperor at a time; the fish can't possibly make  any one emperor--indeed he can't.\"    \"Now, look here,\" said the wife, \"I am king, and you are only my  husband, so will you go at once? Go along! for if he was able to make me  king he is able to make me emperor; and I will and must be emperor, so  go along!\"    So he was obliged to go; and as he went he felt very uncomfortable about  it, and he thought to himself,    \"It is not at all the right thing to do; to want to be emperor is really  going too far; the flounder will soon be beginning to get tired of  this.\"    With that he came to the sea, and the water was quite black and thick,  and the foam flew, and the wind blew, and the man was terrified. But he  stood and said,        \"O man, O man!--if man you be,      Or flounder, flounder, in the sea--      Such a tiresome wife I've got,      For she wants what I do not.\"    \"What is it now?\" said the fish.    \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"my wife wants to be emperor.\"    \"Go home with you,\" said the fish, \"she is emperor already.\"    So the man went home, and found the castle adorned with polished marble  and alabaster figures, and golden gates. The troops were being  marshalled before the door, and they were blowing trumpets and beating  drums and cymbals; and when he entered he saw barons and earls and dukes  waiting about like servants; and the doors were of bright gold. And he  saw his wife sitting upon a throne made of one entire piece of gold, and  it was about two miles high; and she had a great golden crown on, which  was about three yards high, set with brilliants and carbuncles; and in  one hand she held the sceptre, and in the other the globe; and on both  sides of her stood pages in two rows, all arranged according to their  size, from the most enormous giant of two miles high to the tiniest  dwarf of the size of my little finger; and before her stood earls and  dukes in crowds. So the man went up to her and said,    \"Well, wife, so now you are emperor.\"    \"Yes,\" said she, \"now I am emperor.\"    Then he went and sat down and had a good look at her, and then he said,    \"Well now, wife, there is nothing left to be, now you are emperor.\"    \"What are you talking about, husband?\" said she;"]]]
