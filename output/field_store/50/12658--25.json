(#19)"],[1," which have been spent  on its perfection, the pianoforte can be made only feebly to  approximate that sustained style of musical utterance which is the  soul of melody, and finds its loftiest exemplification in singing. To  give out a melody perfectly, presupposes the capacity to sustain tones  without loss in power or quality, to bind them together at will, and  sometimes to intensify their dynamic or expressive force while they  sound. The tone of the pianoforte, being produced by a blow, begins to  die the moment it is created. The history of the instrument's  mechanism, and also of its technical manipulation, is the history of  an effort to reduce this shortcoming to a minimum. It has always  conditioned the character of the music composed for the instrument,  and if we were not in danger of being led into too wide an excursion,  it would be profitable to trace the parallelism which is disclosed by  the mechanical evolution of the instrument, and the technical and  spiritual evolution of the music composed for it. A few points will be  touched upon presently, when the intellectual activity invited by a  recital is brought under consideration.    [Sidenote: _The percussive element._]    [Sidenote: _Melody with drum-beats._]    [Sidenote: _Rhythmical accentuation._]    [Sidenote: _A universal substitute._]    It is to be noted, further, that by a beautiful application of the  doctrine of compensations, the factor which limits the capacity of  the pianoforte as a melody instrument endows it with a merit which no  other instrument has in the same degree, except the instruments of  percussion, which, despite their usefulness, stand on the border line  between savage and civilized music. It is from its relationship to the  drum that the pianoforte derives a peculiarity quite unique in the  melodic and harmonic family. Rhythm is, after all, the starting-point  of music. More than melody, more than harmony, it stirs the blood of  the savage, and since the most vital forces within man are those which  date back to his primitive state, so the sense of rhythm is the most  universal of the musical senses among even the most cultured of  peoples to-day. By themselves the drums, triangles, and cymbals of an  orchestra represent music but one remove from noise; but everybody  knows how marvellously they can be utilized to glorify a climax. Now,  in a very refined degree, every melody on the pianoforte, be it played  as delicately as it may, is a melody with drum-beats. Manufacturers  have done much toward eliminating the thump of the hammers against the  strings, and familiarity with the tone of the instrument has closed  our ears against it to a great extent as something intrusive, but the  blow which excites the string to vibration, and thus generates sound,  is yet a vital factor in determining the character of pianoforte  music. The recurrent pulsations, now energetic, incisive, resolute,  now gentle and caressing, infuse life into the melody, and by  emphasizing its rhythmical structure (without unduly exaggerating it),  present the form of the melody in much sharper outline than is  possible on any other instrument, and much more than one would expect  in view of the evanescent character of the pianoforte's tone. It is  this quality, combined with the mechanism which places all the  gradations of tone, from loudest to softest, at the easy and  instantaneous command of the player, which, I fancy, makes the  pianoforte, in an astonishing degree, a substitute for all the other  instruments. Each instrument in the orchestra has an idiom, which  sounds incomprehensible when uttered by some other of its fellows, but  they can all be translated, with more or less success, into the  language of the pianoforte--not the quality of the tone, though even  that can be suggested, but the character of the phrase. The pianoforte  can sentimentalize like the flute, make a martial proclamation like  the trumpet, intone a prayer like the churchly trombone.    [Sidenote: _The instrument's mechanism._]    [Sidenote: _Tone formation and production._]    In the intricacy of its mechanism the pianoforte stands next to the  organ. The farther removed from direct utterance we are the more  difficult is it to speak the true language of music. The violin player  and the singer, and in a less degree the performers upon some of the  wind instruments, are obliged to form the musical tone--which, in the  case of the pianist, is latent in the instrument, ready to present  itself in two of its attributes in answer to a simple pressure upon  the key. The most unmusical person in the world can learn to produce a  series of tones from a pianoforte which shall be as exact in pitch and  as varied in dynamic force as can Mr. Paderewski. He cannot combine  them so ingeniously nor imbue them with feeling, but in the simple  matter of producing the tone with the attributes mentioned, he is on a  level with the greatest virtuoso. Very different is the case of the  musician who must exercise a distinctly musical gift in the simple  evocation of the materials of music, like the violinist and singer,  who both form and produce the tone. For them compensation flows from  the circumstance that the tone thus formed and produced is naturally  instinct with emotional life in a degree that the pianoforte tone  knows nothing of.    [Sidenote: _Technical manipulation._]    [Sidenote: _Touch and emotionality._]    In one respect, it may be said that the mechanics of pianoforte  playing represent a low plane of artistic activity, a fact which ought  always to be remembered whenever the temptation is felt greatly to  exalt the technique of the art; but it must also be borne in mind that  the mechanical nature of simple tone production in pianoforte playing  raises the value of the emotional quality which, nevertheless, stands  at the command of the player. The emotional potency of the tone must  come from the manner in which the blow is given to the string.  Recognition of this fact has stimulated reflection, and this in turn  has discovered methods by which temperament and emotionality may be  made to express themselves as freely, convincingly, and spontaneously  in pianoforte as in violin playing. If this were not so it would be  impossible to explain the difference in the charm exerted by different  virtuosi, for it has frequently happened that the best-equipped  mechanician and the most intellectual player has been judged inferior  as an artist to another whose gifts were of the soul rather than of  the brains and fingers.    [Sidenote: _The technical cult._]    [Sidenote: _A low form of art._]    The feats accomplished by a pianoforte virtuoso in the mechanical  department are of so extraordinary a nature that there need be small  wonder at the wide prevalence of a distinctly technical cult. All who  know the real nature and mission of music must condemn such a cult. It  is a sign of a want of true appreciation to admire technique for  technique's sake. It is a mistaking of the outward shell for the  kernel, a means for the end. There are still many players who aim to  secure this admiration, either because they are deficient in real  musical feeling, or because they believe themselves surer of winning  applause by thus appealing to the lowest form of appreciation. In the  early part of the century they would have been handicapped by the  instrument which lent itself to delicacy, clearness, and gracefulness  of expression, but had little power. Now the pianoforte has become a  thing of rigid steel, enduring tons of strain from its strings, and  having a voice like the roar of many waters; to keep pace with it  players have become athletes with            \"Thews of Anakim      And pulses of a Titan's heart.\"    [Sidenote: _Technical skill a matter of course._]    They care no more for the \"murmurs made to bless,\" unless it be  occasionally for the sake of contrast, but seek to astound, amaze,  bewilder, and confound with feats of skill and endurance. That with  their devotion to the purely mechanical side of the art they are  threatening to destroy pianoforte playing gives them no pause  whatever. The era which they illustrate and adorn is the technical era  which was, is, and ever shall be, the era of decay in artistic  production. For the judicious technique alone, be it never so  marvellous, cannot serve to-day. Its possession is accepted as a  condition precedent in the case of everyone who ventures to appear  upon the concert-platform. He must be a wonder, indeed, who can  disturb our critical equilibrium by mere digital feats. We want  strength and velocity of finger to be coupled with strength, velocity,  and penetration of thought. We want no halting or lisping in the  proclamation of what the composer has said, but we want the contents  of his thought, not the hollow shell, no matter how distinctly its  outlines be drawn.    [Sidenote: _The plan of study in this chapter._]    [Sidenote: _A typical scheme of pieces._]    The factors which present themselves for consideration at a pianoforte  recital--mechanical, intellectual, and emotional--can be most  intelligently and profitably studied along with the development of the  instrument and its music. All branches of the study are invited by  the typical recital programme. The essentially romantic trend of Mr.  Paderewski's nature makes his excursions into the classical field few  and short; and it is only when a pianist undertakes to emulate  Rubinstein in his historical recitals that the entire pre-Beethoven  vista is opened up. It will suffice for the purposes of this  discussion to imagine a programme containing pieces by Bach, D.  Scarlatti, Handel, and Mozart in one group; a sonata by Beethoven;  some of the shorter pieces of Schumann and Chopin, and one of the  transcriptions or rhapsodies of Liszt.    [Sidenote: _Periods in pianoforte music._]    Such a scheme falls naturally into four divisions,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#19)"],[1,"of prophets, as Paul from the apostles, is Moses,  dark-robed;--in the full light, withdrawn far behind him, Abraham,  embracing Isaac with his left arm, and near him, pale St. Agnes. In  front, nearer, dark and colossal, stands the glorious figure of Santa  Giustina of Padua; then a little subordinate to her, St. Catharine, and,  far on the left, and high, Saint Barbara leaning on her tower. In front,  nearer, flies Raphael; and under him is the four-square group of the  Evangelists. Beneath them, on the left, Noah; on the right, Adam and  Eve, both floating unsupported by cloud or angel; Noah buoyed by the  Ark, which he holds above him, and it is _this_ into which Solomon gazes  down, so earnestly. Eve's face is, perhaps, the most beautiful ever  painted by Tintoret--full in light, but dark-eyed. Adam floats beside  her, his figure fading into a winged gloom, edged in the outline of  fig-leaves. Far down, under these, central in the lowest part of the  picture, rises the Angel of the Sea, praying for Venice; for Tintoret  conceives his Paradise as existing now, not as in the future. I at first  mistook this soft Angel of the Sea for Magdalene, for he is sustained by  other three angels on either side, as the Magdalen is, in designs of  earlier time, because of the verse, \"There is joy in the presence of the  angels over one sinner that repenteth.\" But the Magdalen is on the  right, behind St. Monica; and on the same side, but lowest of all,  Rachel, among the angels of her children gathered now again to her for  ever.    I have no hesitation in asserting this picture to be by far the most  precious work of art of any kind whatsoever, now existing in the world;  and it is, I believe, on the eve of final destruction; for it is said  that the angle of the great council-chamber is soon to be rebuilt; and  that process will involve the destruction of the picture by removal,  and, far more, by repainting. I had thought of making some effort to  save it by an appeal in London to persons generally interested in the  arts; but the recent desolation of Paris has familiarized us with  destruction, and I have no doubt the answer to me would be, that Venice  must take care of her own. But remember, at least, that I have borne  witness to you to-day of the treasures that we forget, while we amuse  ourselves with the poor toys, and the petty, or vile, arts, of our own  time.    The years of that time have perhaps come, when we are to be taught to  look no more to the dreams of painters, either for knowledge of  Judgment, or of Paradise. The anger of Heaven will not longer, I think,  be mocked for our amusement; and perhaps its love may not always be  despised by our pride. Believe me, all the arts, and all the treasures  of men, are fulfilled and preserved to them only, so far as they have  chosen first, with their hearts, not the curse of God, but His blessing.  Our Earth is now encumbered with ruin, our Heaven is clouded by Death.  May we not wisely judge ourselves in some things now, instead of amusing  ourselves with the painting of judgments to come?        _The Relation Between Michael Angelo and Tintoret_ (London, 1872).          AURORA    (_GUIDO RENI_)    CHARLOTTE A. EATON      On the roof of the summer-house of the Palazzo Rospigliosi, is painted  the celebrated fresco of Guido's _Aurora_. Its colouring is clear,  harmonious, airy, brilliant--unfaded by time; and the enthusiastic  admirer of Guido's genius may be permitted to hope that this, his  noblest work, will be immortal as his fame.    [Illustration: AURORA.          _Guido Reni_.]    Morghen's fine engraving may give you some idea of the design and  composition of this beautiful painting; but it cannot convey the soft  harmony of the tints, the living touches, the brilliant forms, the  realized dream of the imagination, that bursts, with all its magic, upon  your enraptured sight in the matchless original. It is embodied poetry.  The Hours, that hand-in-hand encircle the car of Phoebus, advance with  rapid pace. The paler, milder forms of those gentler sisters who rule  over declining day, and the glowing glance of those who bask in the  meridian blaze, resplendent in the hues of heaven,--are of no mortal  grace and beauty; but they are eclipsed by Aurora herself, who sails on  the golden clouds before them, shedding \"showers of shadowing roses\" on  the rejoicing earth; her celestial presence diffusing gladness, and  light, and beauty around. Above the heads of the heavenly coursers,  hovers the morning star, in the form of a youthful cherub, bearing his  flaming torch. Nothing is more admirable in this beautiful composition,  than the motion given to the whole. The smooth and rapid step of the  circling Hours as they tread on the fleecy clouds; the fiery steeds; the  whirling wheels of the car; the torch of Lucifer, blown back by the  velocity of his advance; and the form of Aurora, borne through the  ambient air, till you almost fear she should float from your sight; all  realize the illusion. You seem admitted into the world of fancy, and  revel in its brightest creations.    In the midst of such youth and loveliness, the dusky figure of Phoebus  appears to great disadvantage. It is not happily conceived. Yet his air  is noble and godlike, and his free commanding action, and conscious  ease, as he carelessly guides, with one hand, the fiery steeds that are  harnessed to his flaming car, may, perhaps, compensate in some degree  for his want of beauty; for he certainly is not handsome; and I looked  in vain for the youthful majesty of the god of day, and thought on  Apollo Belvedere. Had Guido thought of it too, he never could have made  this head, which is, I think, the great and only defect of this  exquisite painting; and what makes it of more importance, is, that  Apollo, not Aurora, is the principal figure--the first that catches the  eye, and which, in spite of our dissatisfaction, we are to the last  obliged to contemplate. The defects of his Apollo are a new proof of  what I have very frequently observed, that Guido succeeded far better in  feminine than in masculine beauty. His female forms, in their  loveliness, their delicacy, their grace and sweetness are faultless; and  the beauty and innocence of his infants have seldom been equalled; but  he rarely gave to manly beauty and vigour a character that was noble.    From the _Aurora_ of Guido, we must turn to the rival _Aurora_ of  Guercino, in the Villa Ludovisi. In spite of Guido's bad head of Apollo,  and in spite of Guercino's magic chiaroscuro, I confess myself disposed  to give the preference to Guido. In the first place, there is not the  same unity of composition in Guercino's. It is very fine in all its  parts; but still it _is_ in parts. It is not so fine a _whole_, nor is  it so perfect a composition, nor has it the same charm as Guido's.  Neither is there the same ideal beauty in the Aurora. Guercino's is a  mortal--Guido's a truly ethereal being. Guercino's Aurora is in her car,  drawn by two heavenly steeds, and the shades of night seem to dissipate  at her approach. Old Tithonus, whom she has left behind her seems half  awake; and the morning star, under the figure of a winged genius bearing  his kindled torch, follows her course. In a separate compartment, Night,  in the form of a woman, is sitting musing, or slumbering, over a book.  She has much of the character of a Sibyl. Her dark cave is broken open,  and the blue sky and the coming light break beautifully in upon her and  her companions, the sullen owl and flapping bat, which shrink from its  unwelcome ray. The Hours are represented under the figure of children,  fluttering about before the goddess, and extinguishing the stars of  night--a beautiful idea; but one, perhaps, better adapted to poetry than  painting. The Hours of Guercino are, however, infinitely less poetic  and less beautiful than the bright female forms which encircle the car  of day in Guido's _Aurora_. Yet it is a masterpiece of painting; and but  for the _Aurora_ of Guido, we could have conceived nothing beyond the  _Aurora_ of Guercino.        _Rome in the Nineteenth Century_ (5th edition, London, 1852).          AURORA    (_GUIDO RENI_)    JOHN CONSTABLE      Although no distinct landscape is known by the hand of Guido, yet in a  history of this particular branch it may not be improper to notice its  immense importance as an accessory in his picture of _Aurora_. It is the  finest instance I know of the beauty of natural landscape brought to aid  a mythological story, and to be sensible of its value we have only to  imagine a plain background in its stead. But though Guido has placed us  in the heavens, we are looking towards the earth, where seas and  mountain-tops are receiving the first beams of the morning sun. The  chariot of Apollo is borne on the clouds, attended by the Hours and  preceded by Aurora, who scatters flowers, and the landscape, instead of  diminishing the illusion, is the chief means of producing it, and is  indeed most essential to the story.

THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN    (_TITIAN_)    THEOPHILE GAUTIER      The pearl of the Museum at Madrid is a Raphael; that of Venice is a  Titian, a marvellous canvas, forgotten and afterwards recovered, which  has its legend also. For many long years Venice possessed this  masterpiece without knowing it. Relegated to an old and seldom  frequented church it had disappeared under a slow coating of dust and  behind a network of spider-webs. The subject could scarcely be made out.  One day, Count Cicognora, a great connoisseur, noticing that these rusty  figures had a certain air, and scenting the master under this livery of  neglect and misery, wetted his finger and rubbed the canvas, an action  which is not one of exquisite propriety, but which an expert on pictures  cannot help doing when"]]]
