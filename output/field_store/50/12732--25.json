Such spiritual  victories can now be won for India and Burma by the friends. Let them  dedicate themselves--young and old, men and women alike--and go forth and  settle in new districts, travel, and teach in spite of lack of experience,  and be assured that Baha'u'llah has promised to aid all those who arise in  His Name. His strength will sustain them; their own weakness is  unimportant.          Refrain from Imposing New Rules      In reading your annual Convention report the Guardian has noted the  request made that the N.S.A. should lay down certain rules of procedure.  He has already informed the American N.S.A. that they should henceforth  refrain from laying down any further rules and regulations, as these would  tend to rigidify the affairs of the Cause and ultimately obscure its  spirit and retard its growth. He feels that your Assembly should exercise  the same care, and avoid introducing any rules of procedure not already in  existence. Every case coming before the Assembly should be judged on its  own merits, and be decided individually without any recourse to new  rulings.    The Guardian will constantly pray for the success of all your  undertakings, as well as for the welfare and progress of all the dear  believers in India and Burma. Particularly will he remember in his prayers  the members of the National Assembly who are called upon to direct,  coordinate, and carry out the Indian Baha'is' great and noble teaching  enterprise. Prosecute Six-Year Plan With Unremitting Energy    [From the Guardian:]    The Six-Year Plan, which you have so nobly conceived and so  enthusiastically initiated, must, during these crucial years, when the  first century of the Baha'i Era is drawing to a close, be prosecuted with  unremitting energy, and unshaken determination. The vastness of the field,  the smallness of your numbers, the indifference of the masses, must  neither discourage nor appal you. You should at all times fix your gaze on  the promise of Baha'u'llah, put your whole trust in His creative Word,  recall the past and manifold evidences of His all-encompassing and  resistless power and arise to become worthy and exemplary recipients of  His all-sustaining grace and blessings. I appeal to every Indian and  Burmese believer, however modest his position, however limited his  knowledge, however restricted his means, to rise to the height of this  great opportunity which if missed will not recur again. To disperse, to  settle, to teach by word and deed, to persevere and sacrifice are the  requirements of the present hour. May the Almighty, Whose Cause you are  labouring to advance, endow you and your fellow-workers with all the  wisdom, the strength, and guidance that you need to acquit yourselves  worthily of this task.    June 29, 1941    Shoghi Effendi was also very happy to hear from you that you consider the  Faith is making substantial progress in India, due to the tireless and  devoted efforts of our Baha'i brothers and sisters in that land. He would,  however, urge the friends to follow the example of the American believers  by sending out more pioneers to work in territories where there are no  Baha'is. This is in accordance with the idea expressed by the beloved  Master in the \"Divine Plan\" Tablets, and should be followed by all  Baha'is.    The Guardian will pray for the success of the Summer School to be held in  Surat. He is delighted that the Indian friends are so well organised and  are, year by year, strengthening the administrative institutions of their  Faith.    [From the Guardian:]    I am eagerly and hopefully awaiting to witness fresh evidences of the  renewed determination of the believers throughout India and Burma, to  carry aloft and into virgin territories the torch of Divine Guidance  despite the dark clouds that threaten on the horizon. In these days of  stress and peril, every effort expended, every victory achieved, every  sacrifice made, will be rewarded a hundredfold. I will pray earnestly and  continually that the friends may evince such zeal and perseverance as to  ensure the complete success of the Six-Year Plan which they, of their own  accord, have so splendidly initiated.    October 5, 1941          Every Obstacle Should Be Surmounted      He was very happy to receive so much good news of the progress of the  Baha'i teaching work in India, as well as the success of the Summer  School.    The fact that the friends of India, and also of Iran, are now finding  themselves in a position where they can arise and teach the Cause far and  wide, greatly cheers the Guardian's heart. He hopes that the Baha'is of  India, in spite of the fact that the war is now so close to their native  land, with all its attendant dangers and problems, will allow nothing to  deter them in their prosecution of their Six-Year Teaching Plan for India  and Burma.    Now is the time of true test and trial--the time when the friends must  follow in the footsteps of the first Persian believers, who, heedless of  comfort and even life itself, raised the Banner of Baha'u'llah's Faith  aloft, for all the world to see and follow.    He feels confident that the believers, led by their National Spiritual  Assembly, and aided and inspired by their Local Spiritual Assemblies, will  arise to new heights of service, and distinguish themselves in the eyes of  the Baha'i world. His constant prayers will be offered on their behalf,  and he will remember them in the Shrines with love and yearning for their  success.    [From the Guardian:]    I wish to add a few words in person and appeal to you, and through you to  the dear friends in Burma and India, not to allow, despite the increasing  gravity of the international situation and the dangers that threaten the  East, the work, which has been so enthusiastically initiated, to suffer  through any relaxation of effort, or any deflection of purpose, on the  part of any individual or Assembly. These perils, sufferings and  commotions are blessings in disguise, which pave the way and prepare the  hearts of those who face and sustain them for a deeper realization and an  earlier and fuller acceptance of the Divine Message of Baha'u'llah. The  opportunities are manifold and priceless. Every effort should be exerted,  every sacrifice should be made, every obstacle should be surmounted.    December 16, 1941    It rejoices his heart to see that the Indian believers are now rising to  such noble heights of self-sacrifice and utter devotion to the Faith of  God, and that they are, despite the great difficulty of these war times we  are living through, determined to fulfil their Six-Year Plan of teaching  the Baha'i Cause in India and Burma and complete the spread of its divine  and healing message to her peoples before the end of the first Baha'i  century.          Persecution of Baha'is of Kadwai      He was very sad to hear of the persecution of the Baha'is of Kadwai by the  fanatical Muslim population. Please convey to the friends there the  assurance of his most loving prayers for their protection, and tell them  that, though they are suffering for their Faith, this very persecution is  a blessing to the believers of India, as we know that wherever the Cause  has suffered it has always grown stronger and attracted more attention and  more adherents.    He was also very pleased to hear of the success of the Summer School this  year. The Indian Baha'is have every reason to feel encouraged by the  marked progress of their activities in all fields.          Use of A'rabs (Vowel Points)      Regarding your question as to the use of A'rabs on the Arabic texts of the  Tablets: The Guardian feels that this is a matter which concerns the  entire Baha'i world, and requires to be worked out by a highly specialized  group of qualified people at some future date. He, therefore wishes you  not to print the A'rabs on the Holy Tablets except on rare occasions where  it is absolutely necessary in order to distinguish the word from some  other word just like it.          Two Davids      Abdu'l-Baha is the one who has interpreted the reference of the Bab  concerning David, by saying that there were two Davids, one of them was  the author of the Psalms. The Tablet in which the Master states this is  absolutely authentic, but at the moment the original is not available.          He Whom God Will Make Manifest      The Bab said that whenever \"He whom God will make manifest\" appears,  accept Him. He never said don't accept Him until after the lapse of 1000  years. Also Baha'u'llah says that in the year 9 of the Babi Dispensation  the time was ripe for the Revelation of \"He whom God will make manifest\".  As the Bab was not only a Manifestation but a Herald of this Baha'i Faith,  the interval between His Revelation and that of Baha'u'llah was of shorter  duration. His Dispensation in a sense will last as long as Baha'u'llah's  lasts.          The Holy Book--The Aqdas      There are no doubtful verses in the Holy Book, the Aqdas. The reason it is  not circulated amongst all the Baha'is is, first, because the Cause is not  yet ready or sufficiently matured to put all the provisions of the Aqdas  into effect and, second, because it is a book which requires to be  supplemented by detailed explanations and to be translated into other  languages by a competent body of experts. The provisions of the Aqdas are  gradually, according to the progress of the Cause, being put into effect  already, both in the East and the West.          Use of A'rabs (Vowel Points)      No vowel points, as A'rabs, should be published with any part of the text  of the Aqdas. Certain of the Tablets may be translated in Urdu, but not  the Aqdas itself, for the reasons mentioned above.          Writings of the Bab      The books of the Bab have not as yet been printed in the original.

Regarding the change of the  By-Laws: the Guardian considers the letter he wrote you about this subject  is final. He is considerably surprised by the fact that of all the  National Bodies in the Baha'i World, operating under these By-Laws, it is  only the Assembly of Australia and New Zealand, evidently acting under  pressure from their legal committee, that constantly raises the question  of changing them. This he considers is going too far, and is not  necessary. He holds very bright hopes for the future of your work, and  urges you, and through you all the believers, to concentrate on your  glorious teaching tasks and forge ahead to win new victories for the  beloved Faith.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. Your letter of June 9 has been received, and the Guardian deeply  appreciates the contribution you sent. Please find receipt enclosed. The  map you forwarded will be published in the next volume of \"Baha'i World\"  as the progress it shows will be of great interest to all readers.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The remarkable progress achieved by the Baha'i communities in Australia,  New Zealand and Tasmania in promoting the Plan, designed to further the  interests of the Faith in the Antipodes, is most encouraging, and will,  when consummated, mark the opening of a new and glorious chapter in the  history of the Faith in that continent. The varied and welcome evidences  of the steady extension in the range of the manifold activities of these  communities, the multiplication of Baha'i institutions and their rapid  consolidation, are particularly gratifying and merit the highest praise.    The territories in which these communities conduct their meritorious,  strenuous and highly promising activities with such diligence, resolution,  fidelity and devotion, are admittedly vast and constitute a direct  challenge to those who are called upon to diffuse the light of the Faith,  and lay an unassailable foundation for its rising administrative Order,  throughout the length and breadth of these territories.    The Plan, now operating with increasing momentum in that far-off  continent, is designed to enable its prosecutors to lay the first  foundations of the structure which the members of these communities must  rear in the years to come. As these primary pillars of a divinely ordained  steadily evolving, spiritually propelled order are successively erected  and sufficiently consolidated, and the agencies designed for the launching  of a systematic campaign aiming at the future proclamation of the Faith to  the masses inhabiting these far-flung territories multiply, a simultaneous  effort should be exerted, and measures should be carefully devised, by the  national elected representatives of these same communities, for the  launching of the initial enterprises destined to carry the Message of the  Faith, beyond the confines of these territories, to the Islands of the  Pacific, lying in their immediate neighbourhood.    For whatever may be the nature of the future successive crusades which the  American and Canadian Baha'i communities, may, under the Divine Plan of  'Abdu'l-Baha, launch in the course of the opening decades of the second  Baha'i century, and however extensive the range of their operations, and  no matter how far-reaching the future campaigns which the Baha'i  community, centered in the heart of the British Isles, may undertake  throughout the widely-scattered dependencies of the British Crown, the  responsibility devolving upon the National elected representatives of the  Baha'is of the Australasian continent for the introduction of the Faith  and its initial establishment in the Islands of the Pacific, linking them,  on the one hand, with their sister communities in the American continents  and on the other hand, with the communities in South-Eastern Asia, remains  clear and inescapable.    As the various Baha'i national communities, labouring directly as well as  indirectly, under the impulse of a Divine Plan, broaden and consolidate  the base of their operations in their respective homelands, and acquire  the potentialities that will empower them to lend, in an ever-increasing  measure, their share, and participate in the world-wide propagation of the  Faith, the Australian and New Zealand believers must, for their part,  contribute worthily to the overseas teaching activities and  accomplishments of these communities. Already the Baha'i community in the  Great Republic of the West, the vanguard of the irresistibly marching army  of Baha'u'llah, has launched its twin crusades in Latin America and the  continent of Europe. Its collaborator in the execution of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  Divine Plan, the Canadian Baha'i community is busily engaged in  establishing the Faith beyond the Canadian mainland and further north in  the vast territory of Greenland. The Persian and Iraqi Baha'i communities  are, moreover, assiduously labouring in the adjacent territories of the  Arabian Peninsula and the Kingdom of Afghanistan, while their  sister-communities in the sub-continent of India are pushing the frontiers  of the Faith as far as Ceylon in the South and Siam and Indonesia to the  North and Southeast of that subcontinent. More recently the members of the  British Baha'i community, having brought to a successful conclusion their  first historic Plan, are devising the necessary measures for the launching  of a teaching enterprise in the heart of Africa, supplementing the work  already accomplished by the Egyptian Baha'i community in that continent.  Shortly, and at its appointed time, yet another national community,  already established in the heart of the European continent, will, as soon  as the present obstacles are removed, and its internal activities are  sufficiently consolidated, embark on a campaign, beyond the borders of its  homeland, that will carry the light of the Faith to the adjoining Balkan  territories, the Baltic states and, across the eastern frontiers of  Europe, into Asia.    In this stupendous and laudable collective enterprise, world-wide in its  range, divinely propelled, world-redemptive in its purpose, in which  National Baha'i communities, already sufficiently consolidated from  within, are participating, each in accordance with the provisions of its  own specific plan and constituting, in its proportions and potentialities,  the mightiest spiritual crusade launched since the inception of the  Formative Age of the Faith,--in such an enterprise the Baha'i communities  of Australia and New Zealand can neither afford to remain inactive or play  a negligible part. The situation they occupy, the unnumbered virgin  territories lying in their neighbourhood, the vitality and adventurous  spirit the members of these communities have so strikingly manifested--all  demand that they arise, as soon as the process of internal consolidation  is sufficiently advanced, to play their part in this world-encompassing  crusade now unfolding itself in, and constituting the brightest feature  of, the opening years of the second Baha'i century.    With this glorious vision before them, assured that a full measure of  Divine guidance and sustenance will be vouchsafed to them when they embark  on the second stage of their collective activities, let them concentrate,  in the years immediately ahead, on the tasks that require their earnest  and undivided attention. The prosecution of the Plan, in all its aspects,  is their primary obligation. Whatever contributes to the broadening and  reinforcement of the Administrative Base, designed to guide, coordinate  and extend the ramifications of their future enterprises overseas, should  be unhesitatingly welcomed and carried out at the present hour and during  the opening phase of their collective unified endeavour in the service of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah.    May they seize every opportunity that presents itself, surmount every  obstacle that may confront them in the future, and pave the way for a  befitting inauguration of the subsequent phase of their historic and  rapidly unfolding mission.    Shoghi.            LETTER OF 11 SEPTEMBER, 1950      11 September, 1950    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Under separate cover the Guardian is mailing to you two enlargements of  the finished Arcade of the Bab's Shrine. These are a gift from him to the  N.S.A. and believers, and he would like you to have them circulated as  widely as possible, for the friends to see them, and them hang them in the  National Headquarters.    Please cable receipt of these photos, so he will know they reached you  safely.    Also please inform the friends in the News Letter that copies of one of  these views may be purchased through the American N.S.A., to whom he has  sent the original film.    With loving greetings,  R. Rabbani.            LETTER OF NOV. 14, 1950      Nov. 14, 1950    Dear Baha'i Sister:    I am replying to your letter of September 21 apart from other N.S.A.  correspondence, as the beloved Guardian wishes to assure the Assembly that  the contribution for the Shrine of the Bab has been received. (A receipt  is herewith enclosed.)    He was very touched by the exemplary sense of duty and devotion to the  interests of the Faith which this sum represents. Please, on his behalf,  thank all the donors to the Yerrinbool Dormitory Fund for their prompt  response to his appeal regarding the Holy Shrine.    Already the contract for the stone-work of the Octagon has been placed in  Italy, and he hopes soon the preliminary arrangements locally can be made  for continuing the work.    With loving Baha'i greetings to all the Assembly members from the  Guardian,    Yours in His Service,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Assuring you of my deepfelt and abiding appreciation of the contribution  of the Australian and New Zealand believers for so great and historic an  enterprise, and of my loving and ardent prayers for their spiritual  advancement and the "]]]
