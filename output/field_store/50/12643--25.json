Presently they saw Martha carrying an invisible tray across the  courtyard, for it seemed that, by the most fortunate accident, the  dining-room of the house and the banqueting-hall of the castle were in  the same place. But oh, how their hearts sank when they perceived that  the tray _was_ invisible!    They waited in wretched silence while Martha went through the form of  carving an unseen leg of mutton and serving invisible greens and  potatoes with a spoon that no one could see. When she had left the room,  the children looked at the empty table, and then at each other.    \"This is worse than anything,\" said Robert, who had not till now been  particularly keen on his dinner.    \"I'm not so very hungry,\" said Anthea, trying to make the best of  things, as usual.    Cyril tightened his belt ostentatiously. Jane burst into tears.          CHAPTER VII    A SIEGE AND BED      The children were sitting in the gloomy banqueting-hall, at the end of  one of the long bare wooden tables. There was now no hope. Martha had  brought in the dinner, and the dinner was invisible, and unfeelable too;  for, when they rubbed their hands along the table, they knew but too  well that for them there was nothing there _but_ table.    Suddenly Cyril felt in his pocket.    \"Right, _oh_!\" he cried. \"Look here! Biscuits.\"    Somewhat broken and crumbled, certainly, but still biscuits. Three whole  ones, and a generous handful of crumbs and fragments.    \"I got them this morning--cook--and I'd quite forgotten,\" he explained  as he divided them with scrupulous fairness into four heaps.    They were eaten in a happy silence, though they had an odd taste,  because they had been in Cyril's pocket all the morning with a hank of  tarred twine, some green fir-cones, and a ball of cobbler's wax.    \"Yes, but look here, Squirrel,\" said Robert; \"you're so clever at  explaining about invisibleness and all that. How is it the biscuits are  here, and all the bread and meat and things have disappeared?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Cyril after a pause, \"unless it's because _we_ had  them. Nothing about _us_ has changed. Everything's in my pocket all  right.\"    \"Then if we _had_ the mutton it would be real,\" said Robert. \"Oh, don't  I wish we could find it!\"    \"But we can't find it. I suppose it isn't ours till we've got it in our  mouths.\"    \"Or in our pockets,\" said Jane, thinking of the biscuits.    \"Who puts mutton in their pockets, goose-girl?\" said Cyril. \"But I  know--at any rate, I'll try it!\"    He leaned over the table with his face about an inch from it, and kept  opening and shutting his mouth as if he were taking bites out of air.    \"It's no good,\" said Robert in deep dejection. \"You'll only---- Hullo!\"    Cyril stood up with a grin of triumph, holding a square piece of bread  in his mouth. It was quite real. Everyone saw it. It is true that,  directly he bit a piece off, the rest vanished; but it was all right,  because he knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor  feel it. He took another bite from the air between his fingers, and it  turned into bread as he bit. The next moment all the others were  following his example, and opening and shutting their mouths an inch or  so from the bare-looking table. Robert captured a slice of mutton,  and--but I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene.  It is enough to say that they all had enough mutton, and that when  Martha came to change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess  in all her born days.    The pudding was, fortunately, a plain suet one, and in answer to  Martha's questions the children all with one accord said that they would  _not_ have molasses on it--nor jam, nor sugar--\"Just plain, please,\"  they said. Martha said, \"Well, I never--what next, I wonder!\" and went  away.    Then ensued another scene on which I will not dwell, for nobody looks  nice picking up slices of suet pudding from the table in its mouth, like  a dog.    The great thing, after all, was that they had had dinner; and now  everyone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be  delivered before sunset. Robert, as captain, insisted on climbing to the  top of one of the towers to reconnoitre, so up they all went. And now  they could see all round the castle, and could see, too, that beyond the  moat, on every side, tents of the besieging party were pitched. Rather  uncomfortable shivers ran down the children's backs as they saw that all  the men were very busy cleaning or sharpening their arms, re-stringing  their bows, and polishing their shields. A large party came along the  road, with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree; and Cyril  felt quite pale, because he knew this was for a battering-ram.    \"What a good thing we've got a moat,\" he said; \"and what a good thing  the drawbridge is up--I should never have known how to work it.\"    \"Of course it would be up in a besieged castle.\"    \"You'd think there ought to have been soldiers in it, wouldn't you?\"  said Robert.    \"You see you don't know how long it's been besieged,\" said Cyril darkly;  \"perhaps most of the brave defenders were killed early in the siege and  all the provisions eaten, and now there are only a few intrepid  survivors,--that's us, and we are going to defend it to the death.\"    \"How do you begin--defending to the death, I mean?\" asked Anthea.    \"We ought to be heavily armed--and then shoot at them when they advance  to the attack.\"    \"They used to pour boiling lead down on besiegers when they got too  close,\" said Anthea. \"Father showed me the holes on purpose for pouring  it down through at Bodiam Castle. And there are holes like it in the  gate-tower here.\"    \"I think I'm glad it's only a game; it _is_ only a game, isn't it?\" said  Jane.    But no one answered.    The children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle, and if they  were armed at all it was soon plain that they would be, as Cyril said,  \"armed heavily\"--for these swords and lances and crossbows were far too  weighty even for Cyril's manly strength; and as for the longbows, none  of the children could even begin to bend them. The daggers were better;  but Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough for  daggers to be of any use.    \"Never mind, we can hurl them like javelins,\" said Cyril, \"or drop them  on people's heads. I say--there are lots of stones on the other side of  the courtyard. If we took some of those up? Just to drop on their heads  if they were to try swimming the moat.\"    So a heap of stones grew apace, up in the room above the gate; and  another heap, a shiny spiky dangerous-looking heap, of daggers and  knives.    As Anthea was crossing the courtyard for more stones, a sudden and  valuable idea came to her.    She went to Martha and said, \"May we have just biscuits for tea? We're  going to play at besieged castles, and we'd like the biscuits to  provision the garrison. Put mine in my pocket, please, my hands are so  dirty. And I'll tell the others to fetch theirs.\"    This was indeed a happy thought, for now with four generous handfuls of  air, which turned to biscuits as Martha crammed it into their pockets,  the garrison was well provisioned till sundown.    They brought up some iron pots of cold water to pour on the besiegers  instead of hot lead, with which the castle did not seem to be provided.    The afternoon passed with wonderful quickness. It was very exciting; but  none of them, except Robert, could feel all the time that this was real  deadly dangerous work. To the others, who had only seen the camp and the  besiegers from a distance, the whole thing seemed half a game of  make-believe, and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe dream.  But it was only now and then that Robert could feel this.    When it seemed to be tea-time the biscuits were eaten, with water from  the deep well in the courtyard, drunk out of horns. Cyril insisted on  putting by eight of the biscuits, in case anyone should feel faint in  stress of battle.    Just as he was putting away the reserve biscuits in a sort of little  stone cupboard without a door, a sudden sound made him drop three. It  was the loud fierce cry of a trumpet.    \"You see it _is_ real,\" said Robert, \"and they are going to attack.\"    All rushed to the narrow windows.    \"Yes,\" said Robert, \"they're all coming out of their tents and moving  about like ants. There's that Jakin dancing about where the bridge  joins on. I wish he could see me put my tongue out at him! Yah!\"    The others were far too pale to wish to put their tongues out at  anybody. They looked at Robert with surprised respect. Anthea said--    \"You really _are_ brave, Robert.\"    \"Rot!\" Cyril's pallor turned to redness now, all in a minute. \"He's been  getting ready to be brave all the afternoon. And I wasn't ready, that's  all. I shall be braver than he is in half a jiffy.\"    \"Oh dear!\" said Jane, \"what does it matter which of you is the bravest?  I think Cyril was a perfect silly to wish for a castle, and I don't want  to play.\"    \"It _isn't_\"--Robert was beginning sternly, but Anthea interrupted--    \"Oh yes, you do,\" she said coaxingly; \"it's a very nice game, really,  because they can't possibly get in, and if they do the women and  children are always spared by civilised armies.\"    \"But are you quite, quite sure they _are_ civilised?\" asked Jane,  panting. \"They seem to be such a long time ago.\"    \"Of course they are.\" Anthea pointed cheerfully through the narrow  window. \"Why, look at the little flags on their lances, how bright"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17321"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria in the Light of Recent (#19)"],[1,"of the period, as was usually the case.  Many of the mastabas were excavated by M. de Morgan. Some are of older  periods than the XIIth Dynasty, one belonging to a priest of King  Snefru, Aha-f-ka (\"Ghost-fighter\"), who bore the additional titles of  \"director of prophets and general of infantry.\" There were pluralists  even in those days. And the distinction between the privy councillor  (Geheimrat) and real privy councillor (Wirk-licher-Greheimrat) was quite  familiar; for we find it actually made, many an old Egyptian officially  priding himself in his tomb on having been a real privy councillor! The  Egyptian bureaucracy was already ancient and had its survivals and its  anomalies even as early as the time of the pyramid-builders.    In front of the pyramid of Usertsen (Senusret) III at one time stood the  usual funerary temple, but it has been totally destroyed. By the side of  the pyramid were buried some of the princesses of the royal family, in  a series of tombs opening out of a subterranean gallery, and in this  gallery were found the wonderful jewels of the princesses Sit-hathor and  Merit, which are among the greatest treasures of the Cairo Museum. Those  who have not seen them can obtain a perfect idea of their appearance  from the beautiful water-colour paintings of them by M. Legrain, which  are published in M. de Morgan's work on the \"Fouilles a Dahchour\"  (Vienna, 1895). Altogether one hundred and seven objects were recovered,  consisting of all kinds of jewelry in gold and coloured stones. Among  the most beautiful are the great \"pectorals,\" or breast-ornaments, in  the shape of pylons, with the names of Usertsen II, Usertsen III, and  Amenemhat III; the names are surrounded by hawks standing on the sign  for gold, gryphons, figures of the king striking down enemies, etc., all  in _cloisonne_ work, with beautiful stones such as lapis lazuli, green  felspar, and carnelian taking the place of coloured enamels. The massive  chains of golden beads and cowries are also very remarkable. These  treasures had been buried in boxes in the floor of the subterranean  gallery, and had luckily escaped the notice of plunderers, and so by a  fortunate chance have survived to tell us what the Egyptian jewellers  could do in the days of the XIIth Dynasty. Here also were found two  great Nile barges, full-sized boats, with their oars and other gear  complete. They also may be seen in the Museum of Cairo. It can only be  supposed that they had served as the biers of the royal mummies, and had  been brought up in state on sledges. The actual royal chamber was not  found, although a subterranean gallery was driven beneath the centre of  the pyramid.    The southern brick pyramid was constructed in the same way as the  northern one. At the side of it were also found the tombs of members of  the royal house, including that of the king Hor, already mentioned, with  its interesting contents. The remains of the mummy of this ephemeral  monarch, known only from his tomb, were also found. The entrails of the  king were placed in the usual \"canopic jars,\" which were sealed with the  seal of Amenemhat III; it is thus that we know that Hor died before him.  In many of the inscriptions of this king, on his coffin and stelo, a  peculiarly affected manner of writing the hieroglyphs is found,--the  birds are without their legs, the snake has no tail, the bee no head.  Birds are found without their legs in other inscriptions of this period;  it was a temporary fashion and soon discarded.    In the tomb of a princess named Nubhetep, near at hand, were found more  jewels of the same style as those of Sit-hathor and Merit. The pyramid  itself contained the usual passages and chambers, which were reached  with much difficulty and considerable tunnelling by M. de Morgan. In  fact, the search for the royal death-chambers lasted from December 5,  1894, till March 17, 1895, when the excavators' gallery finally struck  one of the ancient passages, which were found to be unusually extensive,  contrasting in this respect with the northern pyramid. The royal  tomb-chamber had, of course, been emptied of what it contained. It must  be remembered that, in any case, it is probable that the king was not  actually buried here, but in the pyramid of Hawara.    The pyramid of Amenemhat II, which lies between the two brick pyramids,  was built entirely of stone. Nothing of it remains above ground, but the  investigation of the subterranean portions showed that it was remarkable  for the massiveness of its stones and the care with which the masonry  was executed. The same characteristics are found in the dependent tombs  of the princesses Ha and Khnumet, in which more jewelry was found. This  splendid stonework is characteristic of the Middle Kingdom; we find it  also in the temple of Mentuhetep III at Thebes.    Some distance south of Dashur is Medum, where the pyramid of Sneferu  reigns in solitude, and beyond this again is Lisht, where in the  years 1894-6 MM. Gautier and Jequier excavated the pyramid of Usertsen  (Sen-usret) I. The most remarkable find was a cache of the seated  statues of the king in white limestone, in absolutely perfect condition.  They were found lying on their sides, just as they had been hidden. Six  figures of the king in the form of Osiris, with the face painted red,  were also found. Such figures seem to have been regularly set up in  front of a royal sepulchre; several were found in front of the funerary  temple of Mentu-hetep III, Thebes, which we shall describe later. A  fine altar of gray granite, with representations in relief of the nomes  bringing offerings, was also recovered. The pyramid of Lisht itself is  not built of bricks, like those of Dashur, but of stone. It was not,  however, erected in so solid a fashion as those of earlier days at Giza  or Abusir, and nothing is left of it now but a heap of debris. The XIIth  Dynasty architects built walls of magnificent masonry, as we have  seen, and there is no doubt that the stone casing of their pyramids  was originally very fine, but the interior is of brick or rubble; the  wonderful system of building employed by kings of the IVth Dynasty at  Giza was not practised.    South of Lisht is Illahun, and at the entrance to the province of the  Fayyum, and west of this, nearer the Fayyum, is Hawara, where Prof.  Petrie excavated the pyramids of Usertsen (Senusret) II and Amenem-hat  III. His discoveries have already been described by Prof. Maspero in his  history, so that it will suffice here merely to compare them with the  results of M. de Morgan's later work at Dashur and that of MM. Gautier  and Jequier at Lisht, to note recent conclusions in connection with  them, and to describe the newest discoveries in the same region.    Both pyramids are of brick, lined with stone, like those of Dashur, with  some differences of internal construction, since stone walls exist in  the interior. The central chambers and passages leading to them were  discovered; and in both cases the passages are peculiarly complex, with  dumb chambers, great stone portcullises, etc., in order to mislead  and block the way to possible plunderers. The extraordinary sepulchral  chamber of the Hawara pyramid, which, though it is over twenty-two feet  long by ten feet wide over all, is hewn out of one solid block of hard  yellow quartzite, gives some idea of the remarkable facility of dealing  with huge stones and the love of utilizing them which is especially  characteristic of the XIIth Dynasty. The pyramid of Hawara was provided  with a funerary temple the like of which had never been known in Egypt  before and was never known afterwards. It was a huge building far larger  than the pyramid itself, and built of fine limestone and crystalline  white quartzite, in a style eminently characteristic of the XIIth  Dynasty. In actual superficies this temple covered an extent of ground  within which the temples of Karnak, Luxor, and the Ramesseum, at Thebes,  could have stood, but has now almost entirely disappeared, having been  used as a quarry for two thousand years. In Roman times this destroying  process had already begun, but even then the building was still  magnificent, and had been noted with wonder by all the Greek visitors to  Egypt from the time of Herodotus downwards. Even before his day it  had received the name of the \"Labyrinth,\" on account of its supposed  resemblance to the original labyrinth in Crete.    That the Hawara temple was the Egyptian labyrinth was pointed out by  Lepsius in the 'forties of the last century. Within the last two or  three years attention has again been drawn to it by Mr. Arthur Evans's  discovery of the Cretan labyrinth itself in the shape of the Minoan  or early Mycenaean palace of Knossos, near Candia in Crete. It is  impossible to enter here into all the arguments by which it has been  proved that the Knossian palace is the veritable labyrinth of the  Minotaur legend, nor would it be strictly germane to our subject were we  to do so; but it may suffice to say here that the word    [Illustration: 125.jpg (Greek word)]    has been proved to be of Greek-or rather of pre-Hellenic-origin, and  would mean in Karian \"Place of the Double-Axe,\" like La-braunda in  Karia, where Zeus was depicted with a double axe (labrys) in his hand.  The non-Aryan, \"Asianic,\" group of languages, to which certainly Lycian  and probably Karian belong, has been shown by the German philologer  Kretschmer to have spread over Greece into Italy in the period before  the Aryan Greeks entered Hellas, and to have left undoubted traces of  its presence in Greek place-names and in the Greek language itself.  Before the true Hellenes reached Crete, an Asianic dialect must have  been spoken there, and to this language the word \"labyrinth\" must  originally have belonged. The classical labyrinth was \"in the Knossian  territory.\" The palace of Knossos was emphatically the chief seat of the"]]]
