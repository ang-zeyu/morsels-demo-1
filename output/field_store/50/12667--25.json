An allied species  (_Stipa viridula_, bunch-grass) is \"widely diffused over our Rocky  Mountain region, extending to California and British America, and  furnishing a considerable part of the wild forage of the region\" _Stipa  spartea_ bears an ill name among stockmen on account of the fact that at  the base of each seed is a very hard and sharp-pointed callus, which  under certain circumstances (so it is said) lodges in the cheeks of  domestic animals that feed upon this grass when it is dry, and which  cause much trouble. But the buffalo, like the wild horse and half-wild  range cattle, evidently escaped this annoyance. This grass is one of the  common species over a wide area of the northern plains, and is always  found on soil which is comparatively dry. In Dakota, Minnesota, and  northwest Iowa it forms a considerable portion of the upland prairie  hay.    Of the remaining grasses it is practically impossible to single out any  one as being specially entitled to fourth place in this list. There are  several species which flourish in different localities, and in many  respects appear to be of about equal importance as food for stock. Of  these the following are the most noteworthy:    _Aristida purpurea_ (Western beard-grass; purple \"bunch-grass\" of  Montana).--On the high, rolling prairies of the Missouri-Yellowstone  divide this grass is very abundant. It grows in little solitary bunches,  about 6 inches high, scattered through the curly buffalo-grass  (_Bouteloua oligostachya_). Under more favorable conditions it grows to  a height of 12 to 18 inches. It is one of the prettiest grasses of that  region, and in the fall and winter its purplish color makes it quite  noticeable. The Montana stockmen consider it one of the most valuable  grasses of that region for stock of all kinds. Mr. C. M. Jacobs assured  me that the buffalo used to be very fond of this grass, and that  \"wherever this grass grew in abundance there were the best  hunting-grounds for the bison.\" It appears that _Aristida purpurea_ is  not sufficiently abundant elsewhere in the Northwest to make it an  important food for stock; but Dr. Vesey declares that it is \"abundant on  the plains of Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas.\"    _Koeleria cristata._--Very generally distributed from Texas and New  Mexico to the British Possessions; sand hills and arid soils; mountains,  up to 8,000 feet.    _Poa tenuifolia_ (blue-grass of the plains and mountains).--A valuable  \"bunch-grass,\" widely distributed throughout the great pasture region;  grows in all sorts of soils and situations; common in the Yellowstone  Park.    _Festuca scabrella_ (bunch-grass).--One of the most valuable grasses of  Montana and the Northwest generally; often called the \"great  bunch-grass.\" It furnishes excellent food for horses and cattle, and is  so tall it is cut in large quantities for hay. This is the prevailing  species on the foot-hills and mountains generally, up to an altitude of  7,000 feet, where it is succeeded by _Festuca ovina_.    _Andropogon provincialis_ (blue stem).--An important species, extending  from eastern Kansas and Nebraska to the foot-hills of the Rocky  Mountains, and from Northern Texas to the Saskatchewan; common in  Montana on alkali flats and bottom lands generally. This and the  preceding species were of great value to the buffalo in winter, when the  shorter grasses were covered with snow.    _Andropogon scoparius_ (bunch grass; broom sedge; wood-grass).--Similar  to the preceding in distribution and value, but not nearly so tall.    None of the buffalo grasses are found in the mountains. In the mountain  regions which have been visited by the buffalo and in the Yellowstone  Park, where to-day the only herd remaining in a state of nature is to be  found (though not by the man with a gun), the following are the grasses  which form all but a small proportion of the ruminant food: _Koeleria  cristata_; _Poa tenuifolia_ (Western blue-grass); _Stipa viridula_  (feather-grass); _Stipa comata_; _Agropyrum divergens_; _Agropyrum  caninum_.    When pressed by hunger, the buffalo used to browse on certain species of  sage-brush, particularly _Atriplex canescens_ of the Southwest. But he  was discriminating in the matter of diet, and as far as can be  ascertained he was never known to eat the famous and much-dreaded \"loco\"  weed (_Astragalus molissimus_), which to ruminant animals is a veritable  drug of madness. Domestic cattle and horses often eat this plant; where  it is abundant, and become demented in consequence.          VII. MENTAL CAPACITY AND DISPOSITION.      (1) _Reasoning from cause to effect._--The buffalo of the past was an  animal of a rather low order of intelligence, and his dullness of  intellect was one of the important factors in his phenomenally swift  extermination. He was provokingly slow in comprehending the existence  and nature of the dangers that threatened his life, and, like the stupid  brute that he was, would very often stand quietly and see two or three  score, or even a hundred, of his relatives and companions shot down  before his eyes, with no other feeling than one of stupid wonder and  curiosity. Neither the noise nor smoke of the still-hunter's rifle, the  falling, struggling, nor the final death of his companions conveyed to  his mind the idea of a danger to be fled from, and so the herd stood  still and allowed the still-hunter to slaughter its members at will.    Like the Indian, and many white men also, the buffalo seemed to feel  that their number was so great it could never be sensibly diminished.  The presence of such a great multitude gave to each of its individuals a  feeling of security and mutual support that is very generally found in  animals who congregate in great herds. The time was when a band of elk  would stand stupidly and wait for its members to be shot down one after  another; but it is believed that this was due more to panic than to a  lack of comprehension of danger.    The fur seals who cover the \"hauling grounds\" of St. Paul and St. George  Islands, Alaska, in countless thousands, have even less sense of danger  and less comprehension of the slaughter of thousands of their kind,  which takes place daily, than had the bison. They allow themselves to be  herded and driven off landwards from the hauling-ground for half a mile  to the killing-ground, and, finally, with most cheerful indifference,  permit the Aleuts to club their brains out.    It is to be added that whenever and wherever seals or sea-lions inhabit  a given spot, with but few exceptions, it is an easy matter to approach  individuals of the herd. The presence of an immense number of  individuals plainly begets a feeling of security and mutual support. And  let not the bison or the seal be blamed for this, for man himself  exhibits the same foolish instinct. Who has not met the woman of mature  years and full intellectual vigor who is mortally afraid to spend a  night entirely alone in her own house, but is perfectly willing to do  so, and often does do so without fear, when she can have the company of  one small and helpless child, or, what is still worse, three or four of  them! But with the approach of extermination, and the utter breaking up  of all the herds, a complete change has been wrought in the character of  the bison. At last, but alas! entirely too late, the crack of the rifle  and its accompanying puff of smoke conveyed to the slow mind of the  bison a sense of deadly danger to himself. At last he recognized man,  whether on foot or horseback, or peering at him from a coul√©e, as his  mortal enemy. At last he learned to run. In 1886 we found the scattered  remnant of the great northern herd the wildest and most difficult  animals to kill that we had ever hunted in any country. It had been only  through the keenest exercise of all their powers of self-preservation  that those buffaloes had survived until that late day, and we found  them almost as swift as antelopes and far more wary. The instant a  buffalo caught sight of a man, even though a mile distant, he was off at  the top of his speed, and generally ran for some wild region several  miles away.    In our party was an experienced buffalo-hunter, who in three years had  slaughtered over three thousand head for their hides. He declared that  if he could ever catch a \"bunch\" at rest he could \"get a stand\" the same  as he used to do, and kill several head before the rest would run. It so  happened that the first time we found buffaloes we discovered a bunch of  fourteen head, lying in the sun at noon, on the level top of a low  butte, all noses pointing up the wind. We stole up within range and  fired. At the instant the first shot rang out up sprang every buffalo as  if he had been thrown upon his feet by steel springs, and in a second's  time the whole bunch was dashing away from us with the speed of  race-horses.    Our buffalo-hunter declared that in chasing buffaloes we could count  with certainty upon their always running against the wind, for this had  always been their habit. Although this was once their habit, we soon  found that those who now represent the survival of the fittest have  learned better wisdom, and now run (1) away from their pursuer and (2)  toward the best hiding place. Now they pay no attention whatever to the  direction of the wind, and if a pursuer follows straight behind, a  buffalo may change his course three or four times in a 10-mile chase. An  old bull once led one of our hunters around three-quarters of a circle  which had a diameter of 5 or 6 miles.    The last buffaloes were mentally as capable of taking care of themselves  as any animals I ever hunted. The power of original reasoning which they  manifested in scattering all over a given tract of rough country,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#19)"],[1," hundred different descriptions of articles,  yet all are at one price, consisting of everything that can well be  imagined, from a comb to a pair of bellows, the vender singing out the  price with stentorian lungs, perhaps twenty-five sous, more or less, and  as there is a great deal of opposition with these itinerant merchants,  they often try who can cry out the loudest, and succeed in raising a  terrific din, which amuses the mob, who consider that all is life and  spirit as long as there is noise and fun going forward; these  _Boulevards_, therefore, are just such as suit the Parisian lower  classes. Those on the south side of the Seine are an exact contrast,  most of them being so deserted, that in viewing the long lines of tall  arched elms, with scarcely an individual moving beneath them, one could  imagine that they were a hundred miles from any capital; but there is  something pleasing in retiring to these lone green shades, when fatigued  with the bustle and rattling noises of the city. The only individuals  usually to be met with in these quiet _Boulevards_ are now and then a  nursery-maid with a child, an old lady of the gone-by school, and her  female servant of the same era, who jog on at a slow and solemn pace as  they moan over the good old times that are passed, and sympathise in  expressions of horror at the vices of the present day; a tall thin  battered looking beau, whose youth was passed in the last century, meets  the antiquated pair, mutual salutations take place, the gentleman doffs  his hat, and with a graceful sort of turn and wave of the hand, at the  same time bows his body full half way to the ground, which, although  rather stiffened with age, still retains a shadow of the elegance of  former times. Madame makes a very pretty reverence, somewhat  ceremonious, according to the flippant ideas of the present day,  entreats Monsieur would put on his hat, would be in despair if he should  catch cold; he obeys, is enchanted to see her look so well, but  desolated to hear she has a little cold, and after expressing the most  fervent hopes for her getting better, he takes his leave, having too  good a notion of propriety to join the lady in her walk lest a _liaison_  between them might be suspected. How different this worn-out remnant of  the days of Louis the Sixteenth from _la jeune France_ of the present  day, when the usual greeting between the young men would be a nod of the  head, \"_Bon jour, ca va bien?_\" adieu, and away, which is tantamount to  \"How do, quite well, good bye,\" and off; with a lady the abruptness  would be a little softened, but any politeness that gives much trouble  is quite at a discount with such young men of the present day in France.  A solitary workman, a sentinel, and an old soldier, if near the Hospital  of the Invalids, are probably the only persons you will usually meet on  the southern _Boulevards_, except now and then I have seen a ladies'  boarding-school thread its course beneath the thick foliage, whose  mistress perchance selects a retired spot for giving her pupils a little  air and exercise, removed from the gaze of the city throng.    Whatever pleasing impressions these shady retreats may have made upon  the mind, on re-entering Paris they are soon dissipated; if by the  public streets, the variety of noises which assail the ear, and the  confusion of so many people bustling along upon a little bit of pavement  not two feet wide, gives you plenty of occupation both to make your way,  and get out of the way; when, compelled to give place to some lady, you  descend from the narrow flags into the road, and whilst you are  manoeuvring to escape a cart you see coming towards you, \"_Gare_\" is  bawled out with stunning roar; you look round and find the pole of a  coach within an inch of your shoulder, you scramble out of the way as  fast as you can through mud and puddle, and are glad to clap your back  against a house to make room for some lumbering vehicle, where the naves  of the wheels stick out with menacing effect, happy to congratulate  yourself that there is just room enough for it to pass without jamming  you quite flat, and that you are quit of the danger at the expense of  being smeared with a little mud from the wheel; this is the case in many  of the streets in that part of Paris called the _Cite_, and others which  cross from the _Rue Saint-Denis_ to the _Rue Saint-Martin_ and _du  Temple_ etc. Happily for my readers, it is not very probable that many  of them will ever be called into those neighbourhoods, or if they be, it  will probably be in a carriage, when they will not stand near the same  chance of being crushed to death; but as I explore all parts and am  thereby the better enabled to give a faithful picture of Paris, I  consider it incumbent on me to inform my country people that there are  such streets that they may better know how to enjoy Paris by keeping out  of the way of them. To see Paris to the best advantage it is requisite  to get up early, that is about three o'clock in the morning in the  months of June or July, before any one is stirring; this indeed is  pretty much the case with all cities, but particularly the French  capital, because the streets being very narrow and crowded, you have not  room to look up and look about. Paris in the old quarters at that hour,  or in a bright moonlight when all are at rest, has the effect of a city  composed of chateaux or castles joined together, the height of the  houses, the great heavy _porte cocheres_, the castellated style of the  attic windows and often projecting turrets, with the profusion of iron  work, combine in giving a degree of gloom that appears to tell a tale of  olden time, and many of the houses date as far back as Charles the  Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh, which is coeval with our Henry the Fourth,  Fifth, and Sixth. There is one house of which the ancient staircase  still remaining is as old as the year 1220; it is situated in the _Rue  du Four_, near the _Rue de la Harpe_, and called the _Maison Blanche_,  having been inhabited by the mother of _Saint-Louis_, but there is no  doubt that the only part now standing that could have been built at that  period is the staircase; in the same neighbourhood are many objects that  would interest the antiquary, to which I shall hereafter allude. Paris  is encircled by a double row of _Boulevards_, the north inner circle is  that which is the most frequented; the outer circle runs all along the  walls which encompass Paris, where the barriers are situated, of which  there are fifty-six, all rather handsome buildings than otherwise, and  no two of them quite alike. Many of the streets as you approach the  farthest _Boulevards_ of Paris have a very dull appearance, consisting  in many instances of high walls and habitations separated from each  other, with market gardens behind, but which cannot be seen from the  street as they are all enclosed, and grass growing here and there in  patches give them more the appearance of roads which have been  abandoned than of inhabited streets. Some of the modern parts of Paris  are extremely handsome and indeed all which has been built within the  last five-and-twenty years. The _Chaussee-d'Antin_ is the favourite  quarter; there the streets are of a fair width and are well paved, and  some very recently built are really beautiful, especially one just  finished called the _Rue Tronchet_, just behind the _Madeleine_. The  quarter round the _Place Vendome_ is certainly one of the finest in  Paris, and most decidedly the dearest. I know persons who pay fourteen  thousand francs a year for unfurnished lodgings in the _Place Vendome_,  that is 600_l._ a year; a whole house in a fashionable quarter of London  may be had for the same money; indeed on the _Boulevards_, in some of  the _Passages_ and the most fashionable streets in Paris, shops let for  more money than in any part of London; there is an instance of a single  shop letting for 600_l._ per annum, and not one of particularly  extensive dimensions, but situated on the _Boulevard Montmartre_, which  is perhaps the best position in Paris. One of the greatest attractions  is the _Passages_, something in the style of the Burlington Arcade but  mostly superior; of these there are from twenty to thirty, so that in  wet weather you may walk a considerable distance under cover.    The _Palais-Royal_, the favourite resort of foreigners and provincials,  also affords that convenience. Although Paris on the whole is not so  regularly built as London, yet there is a sombre grandeur about it which  has a fine effect, owing in some degree to the large lofty houses of  which it is composed; the straightness, width, and neatness of the  streets of London form its beauty, but it is astonishing how foreigners  when they first behold it, are struck with the small size of the houses.  I remember entering London with an Italian gentleman who had ever before  been accustomed to the large massive palaces of Genoa, Florence, etc.,  and the first remark he made upon our grand metropolis was that it  looked like a city of baby houses; another feature in our dwellings does  not please the foreign eye, and that is the dingy colour of our bricks,  which certainly has not so light an appearance as stone, of which the  houses on the Continent are generally built. The irremediable defect in  Paris is certainly the narrowness of the streets, although every  opportunity is turned to advantage by the government when houses are  taken down to compel the proprietors to rebuild them in such a manner as  to afford a yard more width to the public, whilst those streets that are  at present constructing are on a magnificent plan. The great beauty of  Paris consists in its public monuments, which certainly are not only  very numerous, but some upon the grandest scale, independent of those  which are generally conspicuous in a city; the Barriers and Fountains  form a"]]]
