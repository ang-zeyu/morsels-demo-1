Adams.\"         \"Boston, 25 October, 1777.... This day, dearest of friends,       completes thirteen years since we were solemnly united in       wedlock. Three years of this time we have been cruelly separated.       I have patiently as I could, endured it, with the belief that you       were serving your country....\"         \"May 18, 1778.... Beneath my humble roof, blessed with the       society and tenderest affection of my dear partner, I have       enjoyed as much felicity and as exquisite happiness, as falls to       the share of mortals....\"[76]    And read these snatches from the correspondence of James and Mercy  Warren. Writing to Mercy, in 1775, the husband says: \"I long to see you.  I long to sit with you under our Vines & have none to make us afraid....  I intend to fly Home I mean as soon as Prudence, Duty & Honor will  permitt.\" Again, in 1780, he writes: \"MY DEAR MERCY: ... When shall I  hear from you? My affection is strong, my anxieties are many about you.  You are alone.... If you are not well & happy, how can I be so?\"[77] Her  loving solicitude for his welfare is equally evident in her reply of  December 30 1777: \"Oh! these painful absences. Ten thousand anxieties  invade my Bosom on your account & some times hold my lids waking many  hours of the Cold & Lonely Night.\"[78]    Those heroic days tried the soul of many a wife who held the home  together amidst privation and anguish, while the husband battled for the  homeland. From the trenches as well as from the congressional hall came  many a letter fully as tender, if not so stately, as that written by  George Washington after accepting the appointment as Commander-in-Chief  of the Continental Army:    \"MY DEAREST:--...You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure you,  in the most solemn manner, that, so far from seeking this appointment, I  have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it, not only from my  unwillingness to part with you and the family, but from a consciousness  of its being a trust too great for my capacity, and that I should enjoy  more real happiness in one month with you at home than I have the most  distant prospect of finding abroad, if my stay were to be seven times  seven years.... My unhappiness will flow from the uneasiness you will  feel from being left alone.\"[79]    Even the calm and matter-of-fact Franklin does not fail to express his  affection for wife and home; for, writing to his close friend, Miss Ray,  on March 4, 1755, he describes his longing in these words: \"I began to  think of and wish for home, and, as I drew nearer, I found the  attraction stronger and stronger. My diligence and speed increased with  my impatience. I drove on violently, and made such long stretches that a  very few days brought me to my own house, and to the arms of my good old  wife and children, where I remain, thanks to God, at present well and  happy.\"[80]    And sprightly Eliza Pinckney expresses her admiration for her husband  with her characteristic frankness, when she writes: \"I am married, and  the gentleman I have made choice of comes up to my plan in every title.\"  Years later, after his death, she writes with the same frankness to her  mother: \"I was for more than 14 years the happiest mortal upon Earth!  Heaven had blessed me beyond the lott of Mortals & left me nothing to  wish for.... I had not a desire beyond him.\"[81]    If the letters and other writings describing home life in those old days  may be accepted as true, it is not to be wondered at that husbands  longed so intensely to rejoin the domestic circle. The atmosphere of the  colonial household will be more minutely described when we come to  consider the social life of the women of the times; but at this point we  may well hear a few descriptions of the quaint and thoroughly lovable  homes of our forefathers. William Byrd, the Virginia scholar, statesman,  and wit, tells in some detail of the home of Colonel Spotswood, which he  visited in 1732:        \"In the Evening the noble Colo. came home from his Mines, who       saluted me very civily, and Mrs. Spotswood's Sister, Miss Theky,       who had been to meet him en Cavalier, was so kind too as to bid       me welcome. We talkt over a legend of old Storys, supp'd about 9       and then prattl'd with the Ladys, til twas time for a Travellour       to retire. In the meantime I observ'd my old Friend to be very       Uxorious, and exceedingly fond of his Children. This was so       opposite to the Maxims he us'd to preach up before he was       marry'd, that I you'd not forbear rubbing up the Memory of them.       But he gave a very good-natur'd turn to his Change of Sentiments,       by alleging that who ever brings a poor Gentlewoman into so       solitary a place, from all her Friends and acquaintance, wou'd be       ungrateful not to use her and all that belongs to her with all       possible Tenderness.\"         \"...At Nine we met over a Pot of Coffee, which was not quite       strong enough to give us the Palsy. After Breakfast the Colo. and       I left the Ladys to their Domestick Affairs.... Dinner was both       elegant and plentifull. The afternoon was devoted to the Ladys,       who shew'd me one of their most beautiful Walks. They conducted       me thro' a Shady Lane to the Landing, and by the way made me       drink some very fine Water that issued from a Marble Fountain,       and ran incessantly. Just behind it was a cover'd Bench, where       Miss Theky often sat and bewail'd her fate as an unmarried woman.\"         \"...In the afternoon the Ladys walkt me about amongst all their       little Animals, with which they amuse themselves, and furnish the       Table.... Our Ladys overslept themselves this Morning, so that       we did not break our Fast till Ten.\"[82]    We are so accustomed to look upon George Washington as a godlike man of  austere grandeur, that we seldom or never think of him as lover or  husband. But see how home-like the life at Mount Vernon was, as  described by a young Fredericksburg woman who visited the Washingtons  one Christmas week: \"I must tell you what a charming day I spent at  Mount Vernon with mama and Sally. The Gen'l and Madame came home on  Christmas Eve, and such a racket the Servants made, for they were glad  of their coming! Three handsome young officers came with them. All  Christmas afternoon people came to pay their respects and duty. Among  them were stately dames and gay young women. The Gen'l seemed very  happy, and Mistress Washington was from Daybreake making everything as  agreeable as possible for everybody.\"[83]    Alexander Hamilton found life in his domestic circle so pleasant that he  declared he resigned his seat in Washington's cabinet to enjoy more  freely such happiness. Brooks in her _Dames and Daughters of Colonial  Days_,[84] gives us a pleasing picture of Mrs. Hamilton, \"seated at the  table cutting slices of bread and spreading them with butter for the  younger boys, who, standing by her side, read in turn a chapter in the  Bible or a portion of Goldsmith's _Rome_. When the lessons were finished  the father and the elder children were called to breakfast, after which  the boys were packed off to school.\" \"You cannot imagine how domestic I  am becoming,\" Hamilton writes. \"I sigh for nothing but the society of my  wife and baby.\"      _III. Domestic Toil and Strain_    Despite the charm of colonial home life, however, the strain of that  life upon womankind was far greater than is the strain of modern  domestic duties. In New England this was probably more true than in the  South; for servants were far less plentiful in the North than in  Virginia and the Carolinas. But, on the other hand, the very number of  the domestics in the slave colonies added to the duties and anxieties of  the Southern woman; for genuine executive ability was required in  maintaining order and in feeding, clothing, and caring for the childish,  shiftless, unthinking negroes of the plantation. In the South the slaves  relieved the women of the middle and upper classes of almost manual  labor, and in spite of the constant watchfulness and tact required of  the Southern colonial dame, she possibly found domestic life somewhat  easier than did her sister to the North. The dreary drudgery, the  intense physical labor required of the colonial housewife was of such a  nature that the woman of to-day can scarcely comprehend it. Aside from  the astonishing number of child-births and child-deaths, aside too from  the natural privations, dangers, ravages of war, accidents and diseases,  incident to the settlement of a new country, there was the constant  drain upon the woman's physical strength through lack of those household  conveniences which every home maker now considers mere necessities. It  was a day of polished and sanded floors, and the proverbial neatness of  the colonial woman demanded that these be kept as bright as a mirror.  Many a hundred miles over those floors did the colonial dame travel--on  her knees. Then too every reputable household possessed its abundance of  pewter or silver, and such ware had to be polished with painstaking  regularity. Indeed the wealth of many a dame of those old days consisted  mainly of silver, pewter, and linen, and her pride in these possessions  was almost as vast as the labor she expended in caring for them. What a  collection was in those old-time linen chests! Humphreys, in her  _Catherine Schuyler_, copies the inventory of articles in one: \"35  homespun Sheets, 9 Fine sheets, 12 Tow Sheets, 13 bolster-cases, 6  pillow-biers, 9 diaper brakefast cloathes, 17 Table cloathes, 12 damask  Napkins, 27 homespun"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#19)"],[1,"stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one of  pure, sexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpracticed dream  interpreter. But this symbolic gratification, which would have insured  undisturbed sleep, was not sufficient for the powerful libidinous  excitement. The excitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the whole  stairway symbolism is unmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud lays  stress on the rhythmical character of both actions as one of the reasons  for the sexual utilization of the stairway symbolism, and this dream  especially seems to corroborate this, for, according to the express  assertion of the dreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the most  pronounced feature in the whole dream.    Still another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside from  their real significance, also have the value of \"Weibsbilder\" (literally  _woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown by  the fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just as  the dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. That  cheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitution  complex, just as the dreamer's surname on the little picture and the  thought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parent  complex (to be born on the stairway--to be conceived in coitus).    The indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on the  staircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back into  childhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has its  prototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.      6. A modified stair-dream.    To one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancy  was fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairs  accompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbation  would be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influence  provoked the following dream:    \"His piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, and  for not practicing the _Etudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi's _Gradus ad  Parnassum_.\" In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only a  stairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has a  scale.    It is correct to say that there is no series of associations which  cannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude with  the dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up his  habit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women.    _Preliminary statement._--On the day before the dream he had given a  student instruction concerning Grignard's reaction, in which magnesium  is to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic  influence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in the  course of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned his  hand.    Dream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesium-bromid; he sees the apparatus  with particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for the  magnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeating  to himself, \"This is the right thing, it is working, my feet are  beginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\" Then he reaches  down and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) he  takes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,  \"That cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\"  Then he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because he  wants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of the  dream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeats  continually, \"Phenyl, phenyl.\"_    II. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He is  to be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but he  does not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \"It is too  late now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\" The next  instant he sees the whole family gathered about the table--his mother  and the servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness.  Then he says to himself, \"Well, if we are eating already, I certainly  can't get away.\"_    Analysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a reference  to the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamed  during the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom he  gave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said to  the chemist: \"That isn't right,\" because the magnesium was still  unaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anything  about it: \"It certainly isn't right.\" He himself must be this student;  he is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards his  synthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes the  operation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with his  indifference towards the success achieved!    Moreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) is  made. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs in  the dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady at  a dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him so  closely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing against  her legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighs  as far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. In  this situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which is  at last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towards  the woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.  Feeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refers  to masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....  The rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish to  oversleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, with  masturbation) corresponds with his resistance.    [1] It is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of  fancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They contain  the explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people of being  buried alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious reason for the  belief in a life after death which represents nothing but a projection  into the future of this mysterious life before birth. _The act of birth,  moreover, is the first experience with fear, and is thus the source and  model of the emotion of fear._    [2] Cf. _Zentralblatt fuer psychoanalyse_, I.    [3] Or chapel--vagina.    [4] Symbol of coitus.    [5] Mons veneris.    [6] Crines pubis.

[9] See _Zentralblatt fuer Psychoanalyse_, vol. i., p. 2.          VI    THE WISH IN DREAMS      That the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfillment surely seemed  strange to us all--and that not alone because of the contradictions  offered by the anxiety dream.    After learning from the first analytical explanations that the dream  conceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple a  determination of this sense. According to the correct but concise  definition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking in  sleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day our  thoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts--judgments,  conclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.--why should  our sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the production  of wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present a  different psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is not  the very transparent father's dream mentioned above of just such a  nature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep the  father draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset and  may have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into a  dream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the present  tense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfillment, and  which are we to suspect--the predominance of the thought continued from,  the waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensory  impression?    All these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply  into the part played by the wish-fulfillment in the dream, and into the  significance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.    It is in fact the wish-fulfillment that has already induced us to  separate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that were  plainly wish-fulfillments; and others in which wish-fulfillment could  not be recognized, and was frequently concealed by every available  means. In this latter class of dreams we recognized the influence of the  dream censor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found in  children, yet fleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposely  emphasize this word) to occur also in adults.    We may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But to  what opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \"whence\"? I think  it is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychic  activity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeable  during the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin of  a wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing to  external circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus left  for the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it may  come to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving an  unfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation to  daily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the night  from the suppression. If we now"]]]
