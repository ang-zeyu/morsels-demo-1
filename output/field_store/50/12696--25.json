[l] The 20th Amendment was proposed by Congress on March 2, 1932, when  it passed the Senate [Cong. Rec. (72d Cong., 1st sess.) 5086], having  previously passed the House on March 1 [_Id._, 5027]. It appears  officially in 47 Stat. 745. Ratification was completed on January 23,  1933, when the thirty-sixth State approved the amendment, there being  then 48 States in the Union. On February 6, 1933, Secretary of State  Stimson certified that it had become a part of the Constitution [47  Stat. 2569].

A proposed amendment which would authorize Congress to limit, regulate,  and prohibit the labor of persons under 18 years of age was passed by  Congress on June 2, 1924. This proposal at the time it was submitted to  the States was referred to as \"the proposed 20th Amendment.\" It appears  officially in 43 Stat. 670.    The status of this proposed amendment is a matter of conflicting  opinion. The Kentucky Court of Appeals in Wise _v._ Chandler (270 Ky. 1  [1937]) has held that it is no longer open to ratification because: (1)  Rejected by more than one-fourth of the States; (2) a State may not  reject and then subsequently ratify, at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1864"],[0,"Hero Tales from American History (#19)"],[1,"and long-range firing, together with the New  York and Vermont regiments which were its immediate neighbors in the  line. The fighting was very heavy. In one of the charges, the Maine men  passed over what had been a Confederate regiment. The gray-clad soldiers  were lying, both ranks, privates and officers, as they fell, for so many  had been killed or disabled that it seemed as if the whole regiment was  prone in death.    Much of the time the Maine men lay on the battle-field, hugging the  ground, under a heavy artillery fire, but beyond the reach of ordinary  musketry. One of the privates, named Knox, was a wonderful shot, and had  received permission to use his own special rifle, a weapon accurately  sighted for very long range. While the regiment thus lay under the storm  of shot and shell, he asked leave to go to the front; and for an hour  afterward his companions heard his rifle crack every few minutes. Major  Hyde finally, from curiosity, crept forward to see what he was doing,  and found that he had driven every man away from one section of a  Confederate battery, tumbling over gunner after gunner as they came  forward to fire. One of his victims was a general officer, whose horse  he killed. At the end of an hour or so, a piece of shell took off the  breech of his pet rifle, and he returned disconsolate; but after a few  minutes he gathered three rifles that were left by wounded men, and went  back again to his work.    At five o'clock in the afternoon the regiment was suddenly called upon  to undertake a hopeless charge, owing to the blunder of the brigade  commander, who was a gallant veteran of the Mexican war, but who was  also given to drink. Opposite the Union lines at this point were some  haystacks, near a group of farm buildings. They were right in the center  of the Confederate position, and sharpshooters stationed among them were  picking off the Union gunners. The brigadier, thinking that they were  held by but a few skirmishers, rode to where the 7th Maine was lying  on the ground, and said: \"Major Hyde, take your regiment and drive the  enemy from those trees and buildings.\" Hyde saluted, and said that he  had seen a large force of rebels go in among the buildings, probably two  brigades in all. The brigadier answered, \"Are you afraid to go, sir?\"  and repeated the order emphatically. \"Give the order, so the regiment  can hear it, and we are ready, sir,\" said Hyde. This was done, and  \"Attention\" brought every man to his feet. With the regiment were two  young boys who carried the marking guidons, and Hyde ordered these to  the rear. They pretended to go, but as soon as the regiment charged came  along with it. One of them lost his arm, and the other was killed on the  field. The colors were carried by the color corporal, Harry Campbell.    Hyde gave the orders to left face and forward and the Maine men marched  out in front of a Vermont regiment which lay beside them; then, facing  to the front, they crossed a sunken road, which was so filled with dead  and wounded Confederates that Hyde's horse had to step on them to get  over.    Once across, they stopped for a moment in the trampled corn to  straighten the line, and then charged toward the right of the barns.  On they went at the double-quick, fifteen skirmishers ahead under  Lieutenant Butler, Major Hyde on the right on his Virginia thoroughbred,  and Adjutant Haskell to the left on a big white horse. The latter was  shot down at once, as was his horse, and Hyde rode round in front of the  regiment just in time to see a long line of men in gray rise from behind  the stone wall of the Hagerstown pike, which was to their right, and  pour in a volley; but it mostly went too high. He then ordered his men  to left oblique.    Just as they were abreast a hill to the right of the barns, Hyde, being  some twenty feet ahead, looked over its top and saw several regiments of  Confederates, jammed close together and waiting at the ready; so he gave  the order left flank, and, still at the double quick, took his column  past the barns and buildings toward an orchard on the hither side,  hoping that he could get them back before they were cut off, for they  were faced by ten times their number. By going through the orchard he  expected to be able to take advantage of a hollow, and partially escape  the destructive flank fire on his return.    To hope to keep the barns from which they had driven the sharpshooters  was vain, for the single Maine regiment found itself opposed to portions  of no less than four Confederate brigades, at least a dozen regiments  all told. When the men got to the orchard fence, Sergeant Benson  wrenched apart the tall pickets to let through Hyde's horse. While he  was doing this, a shot struck his haversack, and the men all laughed at  the sight of the flying hardtack.    Going into the orchard there was a rise of ground, and the Confederates  fired several volleys at the Maine men, and then charged them. Hyde's  horse was twice wounded, but was still able to go on.    No sooner were the men in blue beyond the fence than they got into  line and met the Confederates, as they came crowding behind, with  a slaughtering fire, and then charged, driving them back. The color  corporal was still carrying the colors, though one of his arms had been  broken; but when half way through the orchard, Hyde heard him call out  as he fell, and turned back to save the colors, if possible.    The apple-trees were short and thick, and he could not see much, and the  Confederates speedily got between him and his men. Immediately, with the  cry of \"Rally, boys, to save the Major,\" back surged the regiment, and  a volley at arm's length again destroyed all the foremost of their  pursuers; so they rescued both their commander and the flag, which was  carried off by Corporal Ring.    Hyde then formed the regiment on the colors, sixty-eight men all told,  out of two hundred and forty who had begun the charge, and they slowly  marched back toward their place in the Union line, while the New Yorkers  and Vermonters rose from the ground cheering and waving their hats.  Next day, when the Confederates had retired a little from the field,  the color corporal, Campbell, was found in the orchard, dead, propped up  against a tree, with his half-smoked pipe beside him.          THE DEATH OF STONEWALL JACKSON         Like a servant of the Lord, with his bible and his sword,         Our general rode along us, to form us for the fight.                                         --Macaulay.      The Civil War has left, as all wars of brother against brother must  leave, terrible and heartrending memories; but there remains as an  offset the glory which has accrued to the nation by the countless deeds  of heroism performed by both sides in the struggle. The captains and the  armies that, after long years of dreary campaigning and bloody, stubborn  fighting, brought the war to a close, have left us more than a reunited  realm. North and South, all Americans, now have a common fund of  glorious memories. We are the richer for each grim campaign, for each  hard-fought battle. We are the richer for valor displayed alike by  those who fought so valiantly for the right, and by those who, no less  valiantly, fought for what they deemed the right. We have in us nobler  capacities for what is great and good because of the infinite woe and  suffering, and because of the splendid ultimate triumph. We hold that it  was vital to the welfare, not only of our people on this continent, but  of the whole human race, that the Union should be preserved and slavery  abolished; that one flag should fly from the Great Lakes to the Rio  Grande; that we should all be free in fact as well as in name, and that  the United States should stand as one nation--the greatest nation on the  earth. But we recognize gladly that, South as well as North, when the  fight was once on, the leaders of the armies, and the soldiers whom they  led, displayed the same qualities of daring and steadfast courage, of  disinterested loyalty and enthusiasm, and of high devotion to an ideal.    The greatest general of the South was Lee, and his greatest lieutenant  was Jackson. Both were Virginians, and both were strongly opposed to  disunion. Lee went so far as to deny the right of secession, while  Jackson insisted that the South ought to try to get its rights inside  the Union, and not outside. But when Virginia joined the Southern  Confederacy, and the war had actually begun, both men cast their lot  with the South.    It is often said that the Civil War was in one sense a repetition of  the old struggle between the Puritan and the Cavalier; but Puritan and  Cavalier types were common to the two armies. In dash and light-hearted  daring, Custer and Kearney stood as conspicuous as Stuart and Morgan;  and, on the other hand, no Northern general approached the Roundhead  type--the type of the stern, religious warriors who fought under  Cromwell--so closely as Stonewall Jackson. He was a man of intense  religious conviction, who carried into every thought and deed of his  daily life the precepts of the faith he cherished. He was a tender and  loving husband and father, kindhearted and gentle to all with whom he  was brought in contact; yet in the times that tried men's souls, he  proved not only a commander of genius, but a fighter of iron will and  temper, who joyed in the battle, and always showed at his best when  the danger was greatest. The vein of fanaticism that ran through his  character helped to render him a terrible opponent. He knew no such word  as falter, and when he had once put his hand to a piece of work, he did  it thoroughly and with all his heart. It was quite in keeping with his  character that this gentle, high-minded, and religious man should, early  in the contest, have proposed to hoist the black flag, neither take nor  give quarter, and make the war one of extermination.
