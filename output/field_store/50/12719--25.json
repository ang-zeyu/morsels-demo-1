[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#19)"],[1," also seemes to assent unto this, but hee thinkes moreover,  that there are two places of happinesse answerable to those two parts  which hee fancies to remaine of a man when hee is dead, the soule and  the understanding; the soule he thinkes is made of the Moone, and as our  bodies doe so proceede from the dust of this earth, that they shall  returne to it hereafter, so our soules were generated out of that  Planet, and shall bee resolved into it againe, whereas the understanding  shall ascend unto the Sunne, out of which it was made where it shall  possesse an eternity of well being, and farre greater happinesse than  that which is enjoyed in the Moone. So that when a man dies, if his  soule bee much polluted, then must it wander up and downe in the middle  regions of the aire where hell is, and there suffer unspeakable torments  for those sinnes whereof it is guilty. Whereas the soules of better men,  when they have in some space of time beene purged from that impurity  which they did derive from the body, then doe they returne into the  Moone, where they are possest with such a joy, as those men feele who  professe holy misteries, from which place (saith he) some are sent downe  to have the superintendance of Oracles, being diligent either in the  preservation of the good, either from or in all perils, and the  prevention or punishment of all wicked actions, but if in these  imployments they mis-behave themselves, then are they againe to be  imprisoned in a body, otherwise they remaine in the Moone till their  body be resolved into it, & the understanding being cleared from all  impediments, ascends to the Sunne which is its proper place. But this  requires a diverse space of time according to the diverse affections of  the soule. As for those who have beene retired and honest, addicting  themselves to a studious and quiet life, these are quickly preferred to  a higher happinesse. But as for such who have busied themselves in many  broyles, or have beene vehement in the prosecution of any lust, as the  ambitious, the amorous, the wrathfull man, these still retaine the  glimpses and dreames of such things as they have performed in their  bodies, which makes them either altogether unfit to remaine there where  they are, or else keepes them long ere they can put off their soules.  Thus you see _Plutarchs_ opinion concerning the inhabitants and  neighbours of the Moone, which (according to the manner of the  Academickes) hee delivers in a third person; you see he makes that  Planet an inferiour kind of heaven, and though hee differ in many  circumstances, yet doth hee describe it to be some such place, as wee  suppose Paradise to be. You see likewise his opinion concerning the  place of damned spirits, that it is in the middle region of the aire,  and in neither of these is hee singular, but some more late and Orthodox  Writers have agreed with him. As for the place of hell, many thinke it  may be in the aire as well as any where else.    True indeed, Saint _Austin_ affirmes that this place cannot bee  discovered;[1] But others there are who can shew the situation of it out  of Scripture; Some holding it to bee in some other world without this,  because our Saviour calls it +skotos exoteron+, outward darkenesse.[2]  But the most will have it placed towards the Center of our earth,  because 'tis said,[3] Christ descended into the lower parts of the  earth, and some of these are so confident, that this is its situation,  that they can describe you its bignes also, and of what capacity it is.  _Francis Ribera_ in his Comment on the _Revelations_, speaking of those  words, where 'tis said,[4] that the blood went out of the Wine-presse,  even unto the horses bridles by the space of one thousand and sixe  hundred furlongs, interprets them to bee meant of Hell, and that that  number expresses the diameter of its concavity, which is 200 _Italian_  miles; but _Lessius_ thinkes that this opinion gives them too much roome  in hell,[5] and therefore hee guesses that 'tis not so wide; for (saith  hee) the diameter of one league being cubically multiplied, will make a  spheare capable of 800000 millions of damned bodies, allowing to each  sixe foote in the square, whereas (saies hee) 'tis certaine that there  shall not be one hundred thousand millions in all that shall bee damned.  You see the bold _Iesuit_ was carefull that every one should have but  roome enough in hell, and by the strangenesse of the conjecture, you may  guesse that he had rather bee absurd, than seeme either uncharitable or  ignorant. I remember there is a relation in _Pliny_, how that  _Dionisiodorus_ a Mathematician, being dead, did send a letter from his  place to some of his friends upon earth, to certifie them what distance  there was betwixt the center and superficies: hee might have done well  to have prevented this controversie, and enformed them the utmost  capacity of that place. However, certaine it is, that that number cannot  bee knowne, and probable it is, that the place is not yet determined,  but that hell is there where there is any tormented soule, which may bee  in the regions of the aire as well as in the center; but of this onely  occasionally, and by reason of _Plutarchs_ opinion concerning those that  are round about the Moone; as for the Moone it selfe, hee esteemes it to  bee a lower kinde of Heaven, and therefore in another place hee cals it  a terrestriall starre,[6] and an Olympian or celestiall earth  answerable, as I conceive, to the paradise of the Schoolemen, and that  Paradise was either in or neere the Moone, is the opinion of some later  Writers, who derived it (in all likelihood) from the assertion of  _Plato_, and perhaps, this of _Plutarch_. _Tostatus_[7] laies this  opinion upon _Isioder. Hispalensis_, and the venerable _Bede_; and  _Pererius_[8] fathers it upon _Strabus_ and _Rabanus_ his Master. Some  would have it to bee situated in such a place as could not be  discovered, which causes the penman of _Esdras_ to make it a harder  matter to know the outgoings of Paradise, then to weigh the weight of  the fire, or measure the blasts of wind, or call againe a day that is  past.[9] But notwithstanding this, there bee some others who thinke that  it is on the top of some high mountaine under the line, and these  interpreted the torrid Zone to be the flaming Sword whereby Paradise was  guarded. 'Tis the consent of divers others, who agree in this, that  Paradise is situated in some high and eminent place.[10] So _Tostatus_:      _Est etiam Paradisus situ altissima, supra omnem terrae altitudinem_,      \"Paradise is situated in some high place above the earth\":    and therefore in his Coment upon the 49. of _Genesis_, hee understands  the blessing of _Iacob_ concerning the everlasting hills to bee meant of  Paradise, and the blessing it selfe to bee nothing else but a promise of  Christs comming, by whose passion the gates of Paradise should bee  opened. Unto him assented _Rupertus_, _Scotus_, and most of the other  Schoolemen, as I find them cited by _Pererius_,[11] and out of him in  Sr. _W. Rawleigh_. Their reason was this: because in probability this  place was not overflowed by the flood, since there were no sinners there  which might draw that curse upon it. Nay _Tostatus_ thinkes that the  body of _Enoch_ was kept there, and some of the Fathers, as _Tertullian_  and _Austin_ have affirmed, that the blessed soules were reserved in  that place till the day of judgement, and therefore 'tis likely that it  was not overflowed by the flood; and besides, since all men should have  went naked if _Adam_ had not fell, 'tis requisite therefore that it  should be situated in some such place where it might bee priviledged  from the extremities of heat and cold. But now this could not bee (they  thought) so conveniently in any lower, as it might in some higher aire.  For these and such like considerations have so many affirmed that  Paradise was in a high elevated place, which some have conceived could  bee no where but in the Moone: For it could not be in the top of any  mountaine, nor can we thinke of any other body separated from this earth  which can bee a more convenient place for habitation than this Planet,  therefore they concluded that it was there.

Dei. lib. 22. ca. 16._]      [Sidenote 2: Mat. 25. 30]      [Sidenote 3: Eph. 4. 9.]      [Sidenote 4: Rev. 14. 20.]      [Sidenote 5: _De Morib. div. l. 13. c. 24._]      [Sidenote 6: _Cur silent oracula._]      [Sidenote 7: _S.

Because it must bee of a greater extension, and not some small patch  of ground, since 'tis likely all men should have lived there, if _Adam_  had not fell. But for a satisfaction of these arguments, together with a  farther discourse of Paradise, I shall referre you to those who have  written purposely upon this subject. Being content for my owne part to  have spoken so much of it, as may conduce to shew the opinion of others  concerning the inhabitants of the Moone, I dare not my selfe affirme any  thing of these Selenites, because I know not any ground whereon to build  any probable opinion. But I thinke that future ages will discover more;  and our posterity, perhaps, may invent some meanes for our better  acquaintance with these inhabitants. 'Tis the method of providence not  presently to shew us all, but to lead us along from the knowledge of one  thing to another.

A naive understanding is often most strongly exhibited by the  uncultivated--that is, the unspoiled--public, and often is worth more  than any cultivation. The cultivated public should be willing to  accept only the best; it should ruthlessly condemn the bad and the  mediocre.    It is the artist's task, through offering his best and most carefully  prepared achievements, to educate the public, to ennoble it; and he  should carry out his mission without being influenced by bad standards  of taste.    The public, on the other hand, should consider art, not as a matter of  fashion, or as an opportunity to display its clothes, but should feel  it as a true and profound enjoyment, and do everything to second the  artist's efforts.    Arriving late at the opera or in the concert hall is a kind of bad  manners which cannot be sufficiently censured. In the same way, going  out before the end, at unfitting times, and the use of fans in such a  way as to disturb artists and those sitting near, should be avoided by  cultivated people. Artists who are concentrating their whole nature  upon realizing an ideal, which they wish to interpret with the most  perfect expression, should not be disturbed or disquieted.    On the other hand, operatic performances, and concerts especially,  should be limited in duration and in the number of pieces presented.  It is better to offer the public a single symphony or a short list of  songs or pianoforte pieces, which it can listen to with attention and  really absorb, than to provide two or three hours of difficult music  that neither the public can listen to with sufficient attention nor  the artist perform with sufficient concentration.          SECTION XXXVIII    INTERPRETATION      Let us return to the subject of Expression, and examine a song; for  example,    _\"Der Nussbaum\" by Schumann._    The prevailing mood through it is one of quiet gayety, consequently  one demanding a pleasant expression of countenance. The song picture  must rustle by us like a fairy story. The picture shows us the  fragrant nut tree putting forth its leaves in the spring; under it a  maiden lost in reverie, who finally falls asleep, happy in her  thoughts. All is youth and fragrance, a charming little picture, whose  colors must harmonize. None of them should stand out from the frame.  Only one single word rises above the rustling of the tree, and this  must be brought plainly to the hearing of the listening maiden--and  hence, also, of the public--the second \"_next_\" year. The whole song  finds its point in that one word. The nut tree before the house puts  forth its green leaves and sheds its fragrance; its blossoms are  lovingly embraced by the soft breezes, whispering to each other two by  two, and offer their heads to be kissed, nodding and bowing; the song  must be sung with an equal fragrance, each musical phrase in one  breath: that is, with six inaudible breathings, without ritenuto.    They whisper of a maiden who night and day is thinking, she knows not  of what herself. Between \"selber\" and \"nicht was\" a slight separation  of the words can be made, by breaking off the _r_ in \"selber\" nasally;  and holding the tone nasally, without taking a fresh breath, attacking  the \"nicht\" anew. In this way an expression of uncertainty is lent to  the words \"nicht was.\"    But now all becomes quite mysterious. \"They whisper, they  whisper\"--one must bend one's thoughts to hear it; who can understand  so soft a song? But now I hear plainly, even though it be very  soft--the whisper about the bridegroom and the next year, and again  quite significantly, the _next_ year. That is so full of promise, one  can scarcely tear one's self away from the thoughts, from the word in  which love is imparted, and yet that, too, comes to an end!    Now I am the maiden herself who listens, smiling in happiness, to the  rustling of the tree, leaning her head against its trunk, full of  longing fancies as she sinks to sleep and to dream, from which she  would wish never to awaken.    _\"Feldeinsamkeit\" by Brahms._    This song interprets the exalted mood of the soul of the man who,  lying at rest in the long grass, watches the clouds float by, and  whose being is made one with nature as he does so. A whole world of  insects buzzes about him, the air shimmers in the bright sunlight,  flowers shed their perfume; everything about him lives a murmuring  life in tones that seem to enhance the peace of nature, far from the  haunts of men.    As tranquil as are the clouds that pass by, as peaceful as is the mood  of nature, as luxurious as are the flowers that spread their  fragrance, so tranquil and calm must be the breathing of the singer,  which draws the long phrases of the song over the chords of the  accompaniment, and brings before us in words and tones the picture of  the warm peace of summer in nature, and the radiant being of a man  dissolved within it.    I mark the breathing places with _V_. \"Ich liege still im Nohen gruenen  Gras _V_ und sende lange meinen Blick _V_ nach oben _V_ [and again  comfortably, calmly] nach oben.    \"Von Grillen rings umschwaermt _V_ ohn' Unterlass _V_ von Himmelsblaeue  wundersam umwoben _V_ von Himmelsblaeue _V_ _wundersam umwoben_.\"    Each tone, each letter, is connected closely with the preceding and  following; the expression of the eyes and of the soul should be  appropriate to that of the glorified peace of nature and of the soul's  happiness. The last phrase should soar tenderly, saturated with a warm  and soulful coloring.    \"Die schoenen weissen Wolken zieh'n dahin _V_ durch's _tiefe_ Blau _V_,  [I gaze at it for a moment] wie schoene, stille Traeume _V_ [losing  one's self] wie schoene stille Traeume. _V_ [A feeling of dissolution  takes away every thought of living and being.] Mir ist _V_ als ob _V_  ich laengst _V_ gestorben bin! [The whole being is dissolved in the  ether; the end comes with outstretched wings soaring above the earth.]  und ziehe selig mit _V_ durch ew'ge Raeume _V_ und ziehe selig mit _V_  durch ew'ge Raeume. [Dissolution of the soul in the universe must sound  forth from the singer's tone.]    _\"The Erlking,\" by Schubert._    For him who is familiar with our native legends and tales, the willows  and alders in the fields and by the brooks are peopled with hidden  beings, fairies, and witches. They stretch out ghostly arms, as their  veils wave over their loose hair, they bow, cower, raise themselves,  become as big as giants or as little as dwarfs. They seem to lie in  wait for the weak, to fill them with fright.    The father, however, who rides with his child through the night and  the wind, is a man, no ghost; and his faithful steed, that carries  both, no phantom. The picture is presented to us vividly; we can  follow the group for long. The feeling is of haste, but not of  ghostliness. The prelude should consequently sound simply fast, but  not overdrawn. The first phrases of the singer should be connected  with it as a plain narrative.    Suddenly the child hugs the father more closely and buries his face in  terror in his bosom. Lovingly the father bends over him; _quietly_ he  asks him the cause of his fear.    Frightened, the child looks to one side, and asks, in disconnected  phrases, whether his father does not see the Erlking, the Erlking  with his crown and train. They had just ridden by a clump of willows.  Still quietly, the father explains _smilingly_ to his son that what he  saw was a bank of fog hanging over the meadow.    But in the boy's brain the Erlking has already raised his enticing  whisper.[3] The still, small voice, as though coming from another  world, promises the child golden raiment, flowers, and games.    [Footnote 3: The voice of the Erlking is a continuous, soft,  uninterrupted stream of tone, upon which the whispered words are hung.  The Erlking excites the thoughts of the fever-sick boy. The three  enticements must be sung very rapidly, without any interruption of the  breath. The first I sing as far as possible in one breath (if I am not  hampered by the accompanist), or at most in two; the second in two,  the third in three; and here for the first time the words \"reizt\" and  \"branch ich Gewalt\" emerge from the whispered pianissimo.]    Fearfully he asks his father if he does not hear the Erlking's  whispered promises.    \"It is only the dry leaves rustling in the wind.\" The father quiets  him, and his voice is full of firm and loving reassurance, but he  feels that his child is sick.    For but a few seconds all is still; then the voice comes back again.  In a low whisper sounds and words are distinguished. Erlking invites  the boy to play with his daughters, who shall dance with him and rock  him and sing to him.    In the heat of fever the boy implores his father to look for the  Erlking's daughters. The father sees only an old gray willow; but his  voice is no longer calm. Anxiety for his sick child makes his manly  tones break; the comforting words contain already a longing for the  journey's end--quickly, quickly, must he reach it.    Erlking has now completely filled the feverish fancy of the child.  With ruthless power he possesses himself of the boy--all opposition is  vain--the silver cord is loosened. Once more he cries out in fear to  his father, then his eyes are closed. The man, beside himself, strains  every nerve--his own and his horse's; his haste is like a wild  flight. The journey's end is reached; breathless they stop--but the  race was in vain.    A cold shudder runs through even the narrator; his whole being is  strained and tense, he must force his mouth to utter the last words.          SECTION XXXIX    IN CONCLUSION      The class of voice is dependent upon the inborn characteristics of the  vocal organs. But the development of the voice and all else that  appertains to the art of song, can, providing talent is not lacking,  be learned through industry and energy.    If every singer cannot"]]]
