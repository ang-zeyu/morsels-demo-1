THE TRIAL OF ANNIUS FAUSTUS    In a country so divided and tossed by frequent change of rulers         10  between liberty and licence even small events caused serious  disturbance. It happened that Vibius Crispus,[224] a man whose wealth,  influence, and ability had won him a reputation that was great rather  than good, had impeached before the senate a man of equestrian rank,  called Annius Faustus, who had been a professional informer under  Nero. The senate had recently in Galba's principate passed a  resolution authorizing the prosecution of informers. This resolution  had been variously applied from time to time, and interpreted  rigorously or leniently according as the defendant was helpless or  influential. But it still retained some terrors. Crispus, moreover,  had exerted all his powers to secure the conviction of the man who had  informed against his brother.[225] He had, in fact, induced a large  proportion of the senate to demand that Faustus should be sent to  execution undefended and unheard. However, with others, the defendant  gained a great advantage from his prosecutor's undue influence. 'We  must give him time,' they argued, 'the charges must be published:  however hateful the criminal his case must be properly heard.' At  first this advice prevailed. The trial was postponed for a few days.  At length came the conviction of Faustus, which aroused in the country  less satisfaction than his vile character warranted. People recalled  the fact that Crispus himself had turned informer with pecuniary  profit. It was not the penalty but the prosecutor that was unpopular.    FOOTNOTES:        [224] A close friend of Vespasian, who was supposed to ply the            trade of informer (cp. iv. 41 and 43).

At his order the        11  armies of Dalmatia and Pannonia started from their base. They  comprised four legions,[226] each of which had sent forward  detachments two thousand strong. The rest followed at a short  interval: the Seventh legion raised by Galba,[227] the Eleventh and  Thirteenth, both composed of veteran troops, and the Fourteenth, which  had won great distinction by crushing the rebellion in Britain.[228]  Nero had further increased their glory by choosing them for special  service,[229] which accounts for their lasting loyalty to Nero and  their keen support of Otho. But the stronger their numbers the greater  their self-confidence and the slower their march. The cavalry and  auxiliaries preceded the main body of the legions. From Rome itself  came no mean force, five regiments of Guards with some detachments of  cavalry and the First legion.[230] To these were added an irregular  force of 2,000 gladiators,[231] a shameful assistance of which during  the civil wars even strict generals availed themselves. Annius Gallus  was placed in command of these forces with Vestricius Spurinna,[232]  and they were sent forward to hold the line of the Po. Their first  plans had failed, Caecina, whom Otho had hoped to hold within the  Gallic provinces, having already crossed the Alps.[233] Under Otho's  personal command marched picked detachments of his Body Guard and the  rest of the Household troops, together with reservists of the Guard  and a large force of marines.[234] He let no luxury either delay or  disgrace his march. In an iron breast-plate he marched on foot at the  head of his troops, looking rough and dishevelled, quite unlike his  reputation.    Fortune smiled on his first efforts. By sea his fleet held most of      12  the Italian coast right up to the foot of the Maritime Alps. To secure  these mountains and attack the province of Narbonese Gaul he had  placed in command Suedius Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and Aemilius  Pacensis.[235] Pacensis, however, was made a prisoner by his mutinous  troops: Novellus had no authority: Clemens' command rested on  popularity, and he was as greedy of battle as he was criminally blind  to insubordination. No one could have imagined they were in Italy, on  the soil of their native land. As though on foreign shores and among  an enemy's towns, they burnt, ravaged, plundered, with results all the  more horrible since no precautions had been taken against danger. The  fields were full, the houses open. The inhabitants came to meet them  with their wives and children, and were lured by the security of  peace into all the horrors of war. The Governor of the Maritime  Alps[236] at that time was Marius Maturus. He summoned the  inhabitants, whose fighting strength was ample, and proposed to resist  at the frontier the Othonians' invasion of the province. But at the  first engagement the mountaineers were cut down and dispersed. They  had assembled in random haste; they knew nothing of military service  or discipline, nothing of the glory of victory or the disgrace of  flight.    Enraged by this engagement, Otho's troops visited their                 13  indignation on the town of Albintimilium.[237] The battle had brought  them no booty, for the peasants were poor and their armour worthless,  and being swift of foot, with a good knowledge of the country, they  had escaped capture. However, the soldiers sated their greed at the  expense of the innocent town. A Ligurian woman afforded a fine example  of courage which made their conduct the more odious. She had concealed  her son, and when the soldiers, who believed that she had hidden some  money as well, demanded from her under torture where she was keeping  him concealed, she pointed to her belly and replied, 'He is in  hiding.' No subsequent tortures nor even death itself could bring her  to change that brave and noble answer.    Panic-stricken couriers brought to Fabius Valens the news that          14  Otho's fleet was threatening the province of Narbonese Gaul, which had  sworn allegiance to Vitellius. Representatives from the Roman colonies  also arrived beseeching his aid. He dispatched two cohorts of the  Tungri[238] and four troops of horse, together with the entire cavalry  regiment of the Treviri.[239] This force was put under the command of  Julius Classicus,[240] and part of it was detained in the colony of  Forum Julii,[241] since if the whole force marched inland and the  sea-board were left unprotected Otho's fleet would swoop down at once.  Twelve troops of cavalry and a picked body of auxiliaries marched  against the enemy: these were reinforced by a Ligurian cohort which  had long garrisoned this district, and a draft of five hundred  Pannonian recruits who had not yet joined their legion.[242] The  engagement began promptly. Their line was so arranged that some of the  marines, reinforced by the peasants, held the rising ground by the  sea, while the Guards filled the level space between the hills and the  shore. The fleet, acting in conjunction with the land force, was ready  to play its part in the battle, and extended a threatening front  facing the coast. The Vitellians, weaker in infantry, put their trust  in their horse. The mountaineers[243] were posted on the neighbouring  heights, and the auxiliaries massed in close order behind the cavalry.  The Treviran cavalry rashly charged the enemy, and meeting Otho's  guards in front were simultaneously assailed in the flank by the  peasants, flinging stones. This they could do well enough; and,  drafted among the regulars, they all, bold and timid alike, showed the  same courage in the hour of victory. Panic struck the defeated  Vitellians when the fleet began to harass their rear. They were now  surrounded, and would have been entirely destroyed had not darkness  arrested the victors and sheltered their flight. But though beaten      15  the Vitellians were not cowed. Calling up reinforcements, they  suddenly attacked while the unsuspecting enemy were taking their ease  after the victory. They killed the pickets, broke into the camp and  terrified the sailors. In time the panic subsided. The Othonians  seized a hill, defended their position, and eventually assumed the  offensive. The slaughter was frightful. The officers commanding the  Tungri, after a long defence of their position, fell beneath a shower  of weapons. The victory also cost the Othonians heavy loss, for the  enemy's cavalry rallied and cut off all who rashly ventured too far in  pursuit. So they agreed to a sort of armistice. As a safeguard against  sudden raids either by the fleet on the one side or the cavalry on the  other, the Vitellians retired to Antipolis,[244] a town of the  Narbonese province, and the Othonians to Albingaunum[245] in the  interior of Liguria.    The fame of this naval victory kept Corsica and Sardinia and the   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#19)"],[1,"fat lights which smelled and gave off smoke.  Most people washed their bodies. Few babies survived childhood.  If a man reached 30, he could expect to live until age 50. The  sellers of merchandise and hirers of labor were distributed  every morning into their several localities according to their  trade. Outside one of the gates, a horse market was held every  week. They wore horseshoes made of iron or of a crude steel. In  other fields, countryfolk sold pigs, cows, oxen and sheep. London  Bridge was built of stone for the first time. It was supported by  a series of stone arches standing on small man-made islands. It  had such a width that a row of wood houses and a chapel was  built on top of it. In the spring it was impassable by ships  because the flow of water under it varied in height on either  side of the bridge by several feet at half tide.    Men began weaving cloth, which formerly had been done by women.  Some of the cloth was exported.    The weavers guild of London received a charter by the King in  1155, the first granted to any London craft: \"Know that I have  conceded to the Weavers of London to hold their guild in London  with all the liberties and customs which they had in the time of  King Henry [I], my grandfather; and that none may intermeddle  with the craft within the city, nor in Southwark, nor in other  places pertaining to London except through them and except he be  in their guild, otherwise than was accustomed to be done in the  time of King Henry, my grandfather ...So that each year they  render thence to me two marks [26s.8d.] of gold at the feast of  St. Michael. And I forbid that any shall do injury or contumely  to them on this account under penalty of 10 pounds [200s.].  Witness T[homas], Chancellor, and Warinus, son of Gerard,  Chamberlain, at Winchester.\" The liberties obtained were: 1) The  weavers may elect bailiffs to supervise the work of the craft, to  punish defaulters, and to collect the ferm [amount owed to the  King]. The bailiffs were chosen from year to year and swore  before the mayor of London to do and keep their office well and  truly. 2) The bailiffs may hold court from week to week on pleas  of debt, agreements, covenants, and minor trespasses. 3) If any  of the guild members are sued in any other court on any of the  above pleas, the guild may challenge that plea to bring it to  the guild court. 4) If any member is behind in his share of the  payment to the King, the bailiffs may distrain his loom until he  has paid this.    Paying an annual payment freed the weavers from liability to  inconsequent royal fines. Failure to make this payment promptly  might have led to loss of the right, hence the rigorous penalty  of distraint upon the looms of individual weavers who fell into  arrears.    The weavers' guild punished members who used bad thread in their  weaving or did defective weaving by showing the default to the  mayor, with opportunity for the workman to make entreaty, and  the mayor and twelve members of the guild then made a verdict of  amercement of 1/2 mark [6s. 8d.] and the workman of the cloth  was also punished by the guild bailiffs according to guild  custom.    The weavers' guild tradition of brotherliness among members meant  that injury to a fellow weaver incurred a severe penalty. If a  weaver stole or eloigned [removed them to a distance where they  were unreachable] any other weaver's goods falsely and  maliciously, then he was dismissed from the guild and his loom  was taken by the guild to fulfill his portion of the annual  payment to the King. The weavers were allowed to buy and to sell  in London freely and quietly. They had all the rights of other  freemen of the city.    Thus from the middle of the 1100s A.D., the weavers enjoyed the  monopoly of their craft, rights of supervision which ensured a  high standard of workmanship, power to punish infractions of  their privileges, and full control of their members. In this  they stand as the prototype of English medieval guilds. These  rights represented the standard which all bodies of craftsmen  desired to attain. The right of independent jurisdiction was  exceptional.    On the north side of the city was a great forest with fields and  wells where students and other young men from the city took  walks in the fresh evening air. Vendors on the river bank sold  cooked fish caught from the river and wine from ships and wine  cellars.    London's chief magistrate was the port-reeve, who was appointed  by the King, until 1191. Then the port-reeve was replaced by a  mayor, who was elected yearly by the city wards. Each ward was  headed by an alderman and there were city sheriffs and  councilors. The mayors were typically rich merchant princes.  There were three ways to become a citizen of London: being the  son of a citizen, apprenticeship in a craft for seven years, and  purchase of citizenship. London growth led to its replacing  Winchester as the capital. Over its history, it generally chose  or elected its own mayor every year. (This was not a popular  election.) But there were many periods when royal authority was  asserted over it.    St. Barthomew hospital was established in London for the care of  sick pilgrims traveling to the shrine of Becket in Canterbury.    Trading was facilitated by the stabilization of the amount of  silver metallic content of the English coinage, which was called  \"sterling\" [strong] silver. The compass assisted the navigation  of ships and London became a major trading center for foreign  goods from many lands.    About 5% of the knights were literate. Wealthy men sent their  sons to school in monasteries to prepare them for a livelihood  in a profession or in trade or to the town of Oxford, whose  individual teachers had attracted disciples for a long time.  These schools grew up around St. Mary's Church, but had not been  started by the church as there was no cathedral school in  Oxford. Oxford had started as a burh and had a royal residence  and many tradesmen. It was given its basic charter in 1155 by  the King. This confirmed to it all the customs, laws and  liberties [rights] as those enjoyed by London. If became a model  charter for other towns.    Bachelors at Oxford studied the arts of grammar, rhetoric, and  logic, and then music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy,  until they mastered their discipline and therefore were  authorized to teach it. Teaching would then provide an income  sufficient to support a wife. The master of arts was analogous to  the master craftsman of a guild. From 1190, the civil law was  studied, and shortly thereafter, canon law. Later came the study  of medicine. The use of paper supplemented the use of parchment  for writing. Irregular edged paper was made from linen, cotton,  straw, and/or wood beaten to a pulp and then spread out over a  wire mesh to dry.    In this era, the English national race and character was formed.  Stories of good King Arthur were popular and set ideals for  behavior and justice in an otherwise barbaric age where force  was supreme. His last battle in which he lay wounded and told a  kinsman to rule in his place and uphold his laws was written in  poem (\"Layamon's Brut\"). Romantic stories were written and read  in English.    The only people distinguishable as Anglo-Saxon by their look and  speech were manor villeins who worked the farm land, who  composed over half the population. Intermarriage had destroyed  any distinction of Normans by look or speech alone. Although the  villeins could not buy their freedom or be freed by their lord,  they became less numerous because of the preference of  landholders for tenants motivated to perform work by potential  loss of tenure. Also, the Crown's protection of all its subjects  in criminal matters blurred the distinction between free and  unfree men.    The boroughs were dominated by lords of local manors, who usually  had a house in the borough. Similarly, burgesses usually had  farmland outside the borough. Many boroughs were granted the  right to have a common seal for the common business of the town.  Each borough was represented by twelve reputable burgesses. Each  vill was represented by a reeve and four reputable men. Certain  towns sponsored great seasonal fairs for special goods, such as  cloth. Less than 5% of the population lived in towns. Some  windmills were used.    London guilds of craftsmen such as weavers, fullers, bakers,  loriners (makers of bit, spurs, and metal mountings of bridles  and saddles), cordwainers (makers of leather goods such as  shoes), pepperers, and goldsmiths were licensed by the King, for  which they paid him a yearly fee. There were also five Bridge  Guilds (probably raising money for the future construction of  London Bridge in stone) and St. Lazarus' Guild. The wealthy  guilds, which included the goldsmiths, the pepperers, and three  bridge guilds had landholding members who had been thegnes or  knights and now became a class of royal officials: the King's  minters, his chamberlain, his takers of wines, his collectors of  taxes.    Sandwich was confirmed in its port rights by this charter:  \"Henry II to his sheriff and bailiffs of Kent, greeting. I will  and order that the monks of the Holy Trinity of Canterbury shall  have fully all those liberties and customs in Sandwich which  they had in the time of King Henry my grandfather, as it was  adjudged in pursuance of his command by the oath of twelve men of  Dover and twelve men of Sandwich, to wit, that the aforesaid  monks ought to have the port and the toll and all maritime  customs in the same port, on either side of the water from  Eadburge-gate as far as markesfliete and a ferry-boat for  passage. And no man has there any right except they and their  ministers. Wherefore I will and firmly command you and the men  of Sandwich that ye cause the aforesaid monks to have all their  customs both in the port and in the town of Sandwich, and I  forbid any"]]]
