In the course of the evening we rejoined  our party on the Moore River. Next day we halted at Kadjelup; and on the  19th we separated at Neergabby once more, Mr. Spofforth to conduct the  remainder of the party home with as much celerity as they could travel,  whilst I proceeded with Kinchela and Warrup to examine the coast from the  mouth of the Moore River for any traces of Mr. Walker, of whose fate we  were in total ignorance. By noon of the 22nd we had arrived within 12  miles of Perth without remarking the least trace of the supposed  absentee, when we were met by Mr. Hunt the constable with the pleasing  intelligence that Mr. Walker had reached Perth on the 9th instant. In the  evening we arrived at the same place, and found that Mr. Spofforth had  brought in his charge the day before.    ...    CONCLUSION OF THE EXPEDITION.    If Mr. Roe's party had been delayed only a few hours there is every  probability that from the debilitated state in which the men were found  they would all have perished.    I deeply regretted the death of poor Frederic Smith, who had come out  from England expressly for the purpose of joining me, led solely by the  spirit of enterprise, and not with any view of settling. He was the most  youthful of the party, being only 18 years of age, and thence was less  capable than the others of bearing up against long-continued want and  fatigue, and the excessive heat of the climate, under which he gradually  wasted away until death terminated his sufferings. When aroused by danger  or stimulated by a sense of duty he was as bold as a lion, whilst his  manner to me was ever gentleness itself, as indeed it was to all.*    (*Footnote. He was the eldest son of Octavius Smith, Esquire, of Thames  Bank, and grandson of the late William Smith, Esquire, long known in  political life as Member for Norwich.)    Upon the final return of the expedition a desire was expressed by some  gentlemen of the colony of Western Australia to remove Mr. Smith's  remains to Perth; but upon mature reflection I declined their friendly  proposal, preferring rather to let him rest close by the spot where he  died, having given the name of my ill-fated friend to a river which hides  itself in the sandy plains near where he fell so early a sacrifice to his  gallant and enterprising spirit.      CHAPTER 6. SUMMARY OF DISCOVERIES.    RIVERS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES DISCOVERED.    Having now brought the narrative of my expedition along the western  shores of Australia to a close I shall here retrace in a brief summary  the principal geographical discoveries to which it led.    The country examined during this expedition lies between Cape Cuvier and  Swan River, having for its longitudinal limits the parallel of 24 degrees  and that of 32 degrees south latitude, and the expedition combined two  objects: the examination and nautical survey of such parts of the coast  lying between these limits as were imperfectly known, and the exploration  of such parts of the continent as might on examination appear worthy of  particular notice.    RIVERS DISCOVERED.    In the course of my explorations ten rivers, which are, when considered  with reference to the other known ones of Western Australia, of  considerable importance, were discovered, some of them being larger than  any yet found in the south-west of this continent; many smaller streams  were also found.    The larger rivers I have named:    The Gascoyne,  The Murchison,  The Hutt,  The Bowes,  The Buller,  The Chapman,  The Greenough,  The Irwin,  The Arrowsmith,  The Smith.    Two mountain ranges were discovered; one at the northern extremity of the  Darling Range and about thirty miles to the eastward of it, lofty and  altogether differing in character from the Darling, which at this point,  where its direction is nearly north and south, is called Moresby's  Flat-topped Range.    I have taken the liberty of naming this northern range, after her most  gracious Majesty, The Victoria Range; and the extensive district of  fertile country extending from its base to the sea, and having a length  of more than fifty miles in a north and south direction, I have also  named the Province of Victoria, trusting that her Majesty will not object  to bestow her name upon one of the finest provinces in this her new,  vast, and almost unknown empire; and which, protected in its very birth  and infancy by her fostering hand, will doubtless ere long attain to no  mean destiny among the nations of the earth.    The other range is thrown off in a westerly direction from the Darling  Range; it is about forty miles in length from north to south, of a bare,  sterile, and barren nature, and terminates seaward in Mount Perron and  Mount Lesueur; to this range I have given the name of Gairdner's Range:  it forms a very important feature in the geography of this part of  Australia.    DISTRICTS OF BABBAGE AND VICTORIA.    Three extensive districts of good country were also found in the course  of this expedition, the Province of Victoria, before alluded to, the  district of Babbage, and another adjacent to Perth, to which I have not  affixed a name.    The district of Babbage is situated on and near the river Gascoyne, which  stream discharges itself in the central part of the main that fronts  Shark Bay, and may indeed almost be recorded as the central point of the  western coast of Australia; thus at once occupying the most commanding  position in Shark Bay and one of the most interesting points on that  coast; it is moreover the key to a very fine district which is the only  one in that vast inlet that appears well adapted to the purposes of  colonization.    COAST OF SHARK BAY.    Immediately to the south of the southern mouth of this river commences a  line of shoals which at low-water are nearly dry, extending to a distance  of from two to four miles from the coast and running with scarcely any  intermission round the bay: except at high-water it is therefore  impossible to approach the greater part of the coast, even in the  smallest boat, unless by tracking it over those flats, which proceeding  is not unattended with danger, for, if it comes on to blow at all hard,  owing to the shoalness of the water, the whole of them becomes a mass of  broken billows. I feel convinced it was owing to this circumstance that  the navigators who had previously visited this bay left so large a  portion of its coast unexplored.    The shoals in the vicinity of the mouth of this river, as well as those  in the river itself, have many snags upon them; and on the coast of  Bernier Island, opposite to the main, we found the remains of large trees  which had been washed down the river and had then been drifted across the  bay. It was that circumstance which first convinced me that a large river  existed hereabouts, and induced me so minutely to examine the coast.    This occurrence of driftwood in the neighbourhood of large rivers is a  circumstance unknown upon the south-western shores of this continent. I  however observed it in Prince Regent's River and other rivers to the  north, as well as in the Arrowsmith. This latter however is the most  southern river in which I have remarked it, and it certainly is an  evidence of the existence of timber of a much lighter description than  has hitherto been known in this part of the continent.    MOUTHS OF THE GASCOYNE.    The southern mouth of the Gascoyne is however completely free from  shoals, and has seven feet water on the bar at low tide. There is also a  channel in it which has never less than this depth of water for about  four miles from its mouth, after which it is only navigable for small  boats in the dry season, and that merely for a short distance.    The greatest difficulty which presents itself in entering the southern  mouth arises from what in America are termed snags, that is, large trees,  the roots of which are firmly planted in the bed of the river, whilst the  branches project up the stream, and are likely to pierce any boat in its  passage down. These snags are however more to be feared at the time of  high-water than at any other period, for they have generally become fixed  upon shoals as they originally descended the river, and at low water can  easily be seen.    The northern mouth of the Gascoyne is more difficult of entrance than its  southern one, being narrower and more shoal. I still however think that  at high water it could be entered by small craft; but as my examination  of it was hurried and imperfect from our being pressed for provisions at  the time I was there, the opinion I have given above must be received  with caution.    Our visit to this river took place at the close of a season which had  been preceded by the driest one known since the occupation of the western  coasts by Europeans. There was consequently but little fresh water in the  bed of the river, and this only in small pools; but the breadth of its  main channel (for it sometimes had several) was where I measured it  upwards of three hundred yards, and this measurement was made in a part  which was by no means the widest.    THE COUNTRY ADJACENT.    The bed of the river was composed of fine white sand. The country had a  gentle slope from the interior, and no land of any great elevation was  visible from the farthest point I attained, distant about fifteen miles  from the coast.    Plains of a rich reddish loam bordered the river on each side. These were  occasionally broken by low, gently-rounded hills, composed of the same  soil. Freshwater lagoons, frequented by wild-fowl, were found in several  places; and during the course of my walks, which extended for several  miles in various directions, I saw no termination to this good land  except on approaching the sea, where the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#19)"],[1,"supplies. Wenamon states in his report that Dor was at  this time a city of the Thekel or Sicilians, some wandering band of  sea-rovers having left their native Sicily to settle here, at first  under the protection of the Egyptians, but now independent of them. The  King of Dor, by name Bedel, hearing that an envoy of the High Priest of  Amon-Ra had arrived in his harbour, very politely sent down to him a  joint of beef, some loaves of bread, and a jar of wine, upon which  Wenamon must have set to with an appetite, after subsisting upon the  scanty rations of the sea for so long a time.    It may be that the wine was more potent than that to which the Egyptian  was accustomed; or perhaps the white buildings of the city, glistening  in the sunlight, and the busy quays, engrossed his attention too  completely: anyhow, the second of his misfortunes now befel him. One of  the Syrian sailors seized the opportunity to slip into his cabin and to  steal the money which was hidden there. Before Wenamon had detected the  robbery the sailor had disappeared for ever amidst the houses of Dor.  That evening the distracted envoy, seated upon the floor of his cabin,  was obliged to chronicle the list of stolen money, which list was  afterwards incorporated in his report in the following manner:--    One vessel containing gold amounting to            5 debens,  Four vessels containing silver amounting to       20   \"  One wallet containing silver amounting to         11   \"                                                    ---------  Total of what was stolen: gold, 5 debens; silver, 31 debens.    A deben weighed about 100 grammes, and thus the robber was richer by  500 grammes of gold, which in those days would have the purchasing value  of about L600 in our money, and 3100 grammes of silver, equal to about  L2200.[1]        [Footnote 1: See Weigall: Catalogue of Weights and Balances in                   the Cairo Museum, p. xvi.]      [Illustration: PL. XII. A reed box for holding clothing, discovered in                          the tomb of Yuaa and Tuau.                          --CAIRO MUSEUM.]                            [_Photo by E. Brugsch Pasha._    Wenamon must have slept little that night, and early on the following  morning he hastened to the palace of King Bedel to lay his case before  him. Fortunately Bedel did not ask him for his credentials, but with the  utmost politeness he gave his consideration to the affair. Wenamon's  words, however, were by no means polite, and one finds in them a  blustering assurance which suggests that he considered himself a  personage of extreme consequence, and regarded a King of Dor as nothing  in comparison with an envoy of Amon-Ra.    \"I have been robbed in your harbour,\" he cried, so he tells us in the  report, \"and, since you are the king of this land, you must be regarded  as a party to the crime. You must search for my money. The money belongs  to Nesubanebded, and it belongs to Herhor, my lord\" (no mention,  observe, of the wretched Rameses XII.), \"and to the other nobles of  Egypt. It belongs also to Weret, and to Mekmel, and to Zakar-Baal the  Prince of Byblos.\"[2] These latter were the persons to whom it was to be  paid.        [Footnote 2: The translation is based on that of Prof. Breasted.]    The King of Dor listened to this outburst with Sicilian politeness, and  replied in the following very correct terms: \"With all due respect to  your honour and excellency,\" he said, \"I know nothing of this complaint  which you have lodged with me. If the thief belonged to my land and went  on board your ship in order to steal your money, I would advance you the  sum from my treasury while they were finding the culprit. But the thief  who robbed you belonged to your ship. Tarry, however, a few days here  with me and I will seek him.\"    Wenamon, therefore, strode back to the vessel, and there remained,  fuming and fretting, for nine long days. The skipper Mengebet, however,  had no reason to remain at Dor, and seems to have told Wenamon that he  could wait no longer. On the tenth day, therefore, Wenamon retraced his  steps to the palace, and addressed himself once more to Bedel. \"Look,\"  he said to the king, when he was ushered into the royal presence, \"you  have not found my money, and therefore you had better let me go with my  ship's captain and with those....\" The rest of the interview is lost in  a lacuna, and practically the only words which the damaged condition of  the papyrus permits one now to read are, \"He said, 'Be silent!'\" which  indicates that even the patience of a King of Dor could be exhausted.    When the narrative is able to be resumed one finds that Wenamon has set  sail from the city, and has travelled along the coast to the proud city  of Tyre, where he arrived one afternoon penniless and letterless,  having now nothing left but the little Amon-of-the-Road and his own  audacity. The charms of Tyre, then one of the great ports of the  civilised world, were of no consequence to the destitute Egyptian, nor  do they seem to have attracted the skipper of his ship, who, after his  long delay at Dor, was in no mood to linger. At dawn the next morning,  therefore, the journey was continued, and once more an unfortunate  lacuna interrupts the passage of the report. From the tattered fragments  of the writing, however, it seems that at the next port of call--perhaps  the city of Sidon--a party of inoffensive Sicilian merchants was  encountered, and immediately the desperate Wenamon hatched a daring  plot. By this time he had come to place some trust in Mengebet, the  skipper, who, for the sake of his own good standing in Egypt, had shown  himself willing to help the envoy of Amon-Ra in his troubles, although  he would not go so far as to delay his journey for him; and Wenamon  therefore admitted him to his councils. On some pretext or other a party  led by the Egyptian paid a visit to these merchants and entered into  conversation with them. Then, suddenly overpowering them, a rush was  made for their cash-box, which Wenamon at once burst open. To his  disappointment he found it to contain only thirty-one debens of silver,  which happened to be precisely the amount of silver, though not of gold,  which he had lost. This sum he pocketed, saying to the struggling  merchants as he did so, \"I will take this money of yours, and will keep  it until you find my money. Was it not a Sicilian who stole it, and no  thief of ours? I will take it.\"    With these words the party raced back to the ship, scrambled on board,  and in a few moments had hoisted sail and were scudding northwards  towards Byblos, where Wenamon proposed to throw himself on the mercy of  Zakar-Baal, the prince of that city. Wenamon, it will be remembered, had  always considered that he had been robbed by a Sicilian of Dor,  notwithstanding the fact that only a sailor of his own ship could have  known of the existence of the money, as King Bedel seems to have pointed  out to him. The Egyptian, therefore, did not regard this forcible  seizure of silver from these other Sicilians as a crime. It was a  perfectly just appropriation of a portion of the funds which belonged to  him by rights. Let us imagine ourselves robbed at our hotel by Hans the  German waiter: it would surely give us the most profound satisfaction to  take Herr Schnupfendorff, the piano-tuner, by the throat when next he  visited us, and go through his pockets. He and Hans, being of the same  nationality, must suffer for one another's sins, and if the magistrate  thinks otherwise he must be regarded as prejudiced by too much study of  the law.    Byblos stood at the foot of the hills of Lebanon, in the very shadow of  the great cedars, and it was therefore Wenamon's destination. Now,  however, as the ship dropped anchor in the harbour, the Egyptian  realised that his mission would probably be fruitless, and that he  himself would perhaps be flung into prison for illegally having in his  possession the famous image of the god to which he could show no written  right. Moreover, the news of the robbery of the merchants might well  have reached Byblos overland. His first action, therefore, was to  conceal the idol and the money; and this having been accomplished he sat  himself down in his cabin to await events.    The Prince of Byblos certainly had been advised of the robbery; and as  soon as the news of the ship's arrival was reported to him he sent a  curt message to the captain saying simply, \"Get out of my harbour.\" At  this Wenamon gave up all hope, and, hearing that there was then in port  a vessel which was about to sail for Egypt, he sent a pathetic message  to the prince asking whether he might be allowed to travel by it back to  his own country.    No satisfactory answer was received, and for the best part of a month  Wenamon's ship rode at anchor, while the distracted envoy paced the  deck, vainly pondering upon a fitting course of action. Each morning the  same brief order, \"Get out of my harbour,\" was delivered to him by the  harbour-master; but the indecision of the authorities as to how to treat  this Egyptian official prevented the order being backed by force.  Meanwhile Wenamon and Mengebet judiciously spread through the city the  report of the power of Amon-of-the-Road, and hinted darkly at the wrath  which would ultimately fall upon the heads of those who suffered the  image and its keeper to be turned away from the quays of Byblos. No  doubt, also, a portion of the stolen debens of silver was expended in  bribes to the priests of the city, for, as we shall presently see, one  of them took up Wenamon's cause with the most unnatural vigour.    All, however, seemed to be of no avail, and Wenamon decided to get away  as best he could. His worldly goods were quietly transferred to the ship  which was bound for the Nile; and, when night had fallen, with  Amon-of-the-Road tucked under his arm, he hurried along the deserted  quay. "]]]
