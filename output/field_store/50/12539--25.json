He will hardly be able to go home to-day, Arthur?\"    \"No, sir; leave him here in my care. To-morrow he will probably be quite  recovered, and I will drive him over in my gig.\"    \"Would you like me to stay with you, Max?\" Violet asked, laying her cool  hand on his forehead.    \"Or me?\" asked her mother.    \"No, thank you, Grandma Elsie and Mamma Vi,\" he said. \"You are both very  kind, but Walter and Gracie wouldn't know what to do without you; and I  shall do very well.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ralph, \"I'll help Art take care of him. I ought to, as I gave  him the cigar that sickened him so.\"    Mr. Dinsmore and the ladies then bade good-by and went down-stairs, the  doctor accompanying them, leaving the two boys alone together.    \"Do you begin to get over it, old fellow?\" asked Ralph.    \"No; I'm wretchedly sick,\" said Max. \"I think I've had enough tobacco to  last me all my days.\"    \"O pshaw! it won't be half so bad next time, and pretty soon won't sicken  you at all.\"    \"But what should I gain to pay me for all the suffering?\"    \"Well, it seems sort o' babyish not to smoke.\"    \"Does it? I've never seen Grandpa Dinsmore smoke, and I don't believe he  ever does, nor Uncle Edward, nor Uncle Horace either.\"    \"No, they don't, and Art doesn't, but they're all sort o' pious old  fogies,\" Ralph said, with a coarse laugh.    \"I wouldn't talk so about my own relations, if I were you,\" returned Max,  in a tone of disgust.    \"Of course I shouldn't let anybody else say a word against them,\" said  Ralph.    Arthur's entrance put an end to the conversation. He inquired of Max if  the sickness were abating; then sitting down beside him, \"Boys,\" he said,  \"I want to talk to you a little about this silly business of smoking and  chewing.\"    \"I've never chewed,\" said Max.    \"I'm glad to hear it, and I hope you never will, or smoke again either.  How would you like, Max, to have a cancer on your lip?\"    \"Cancer, sir? I wouldn't choose to have one for anything in the world.\"    \"Then don't smoke, especially a short pipe, for it often causes cancer of  the lip. I cut one out of a man's lip the other day; and not long ago saw  a man die from one after months of agonizing pain. Tobacco contains a  great deal of virulent poison, and though some persons use it for many  years without much apparent injury, it costs many others loss of health  and even of life. It weakens the nerves and the action of the heart, and  is a fruitful source of dyspepsia.\"    \"Pooh! I don't believe it will ever hurt me,\" said Ralph.    \"I think it will,\" said Arthur; \"you have not yet attained your growth,  and therefore are the more certain to be injured by its use.    \"Max, my boy, I admire your father greatly, particularly his magnificent  physique.\"    Max flushed with pleasure.    \"Do you not wish to be like him in that? as tall and finely developed?\"    \"Yes, sir; yes, indeed! I want to be like papa in everything!\"    \"Then eschew tobacco, for it will stunt your growth!\"    \"But papa smokes,\" repeated Max.    \"Now, but probably he did not until grown,\" said Arthur. \"And very likely  he sometimes wishes he had never contracted the habit. Now I must leave  you for a time, as I have some other patients to visit.\"    \"I told you he was an old fogy,\" said Ralph, as the door closed on his  brother, adding with an oath, \"I believe he wouldn't allow a fellow a bit  of pleasure if he could help it.\"    Max started, and looked at Ralph with troubled eyes. \"I didn't think you  would swear,\" he said. \"If you do, I--I can't be intimate with you,  because my father won't allow it.\"    \"I don't often,\" said Ralph, looking ashamed, \"I won't again in your  company.\"          CHAPTER XIV.        \"Be sure your sin will find you out.\"                       --_Num._ 32:33.      Gracie and Walter were in the play-room. They had been building  block-houses for an hour or more, when Gracie, saying, \"I'm tired, Walter,  I'm going in yonder to see the things Max and Lulu are making,\" rose and  sauntered into the work-room.    She watched the busy carvers for some minutes, then went down to Violet's  apartments in search of her.    She found no one there but Agnes busied in putting away some clean  clothes, fresh from the iron.    \"Where's mamma?\" asked the little girl.    \"In de drawin'-room, Miss Gracie. Comp'ny dar.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" sighed Gracie, \"I just wanted her to talk to me.\"    \"'Spect you hab to wait till de comp'ny am gone,\" returned Agnes, picking  up her empty clothes-basket and leaving the room.    Gracie wandered disconsolately about the rooms, wishing that the callers  would go and mamma come up. Presently she paused before the bureau in  Violet's dressing-room, and began fingering the pretty things on it.    She was not usually a meddlesome child, but just now was tempted to  mischief from the lack of something else to interest and employ her.    She handled the articles carefully, however, and did them no damage till  she came to a beautiful cut-glass bottle filled with a costly perfume of  which she was extravagantly fond.    Violet had frequently given her a few drops on her handkerchief without  being asked, and never refused a request for it.    Gracie, seized with a desire for it, took a clean handkerchief from a  drawer and helped herself, saying half aloud, by way of quieting her  conscience, \"Mamma would give it to me if she was here, she always does,  and I'll be careful not to break the bottle.\"    She was pouring from it as she spoke. Just at that instant she heard a  step in the hall without, and a sound as if a hand was laid on the  door-knob.    It so startled her that the bottle slipped from her fingers, and striking  the bureau as it fell, lay in fragments at her feet; its contents were  spilled upon the carpet, and the air of the room was redolent of the  delicious perfume.    Gracie, naturally a timid child, shrinking from everything like reproof or  punishment, stood aghast at the mischief she had wrought.    \"What will mamma say?\" was her first thought. \"Oh, I'm afraid she will be  so vexed with me that she'll never love me any more!\" And the tears came  thick and fast, for mamma's love was very sweet to the little feeble  child, who had been so long without a mother's care and tenderness.    Then arose the wish to hide her fault. Oh, if she could only replace the  bottle! but that was quite impossible. Perhaps, though, there might be a  way found to conceal the fact that she was the author of the mishap; she  did not want to have any one else blamed for her fault, but she would like  not to be suspected of it herself.    A bright thought struck her. She had seen the cat jump on that bureau a  few days before and walk back and forth over it. If she (pussy) had been  left in the room alone there that afternoon she might have done the same  thing again, and knocked the bottle off upon the floor.    It would be no great harm, the little girl reasoned, trying to stifle the  warnings and reproaches of conscience, if she should let pussy take the  blame.    Mamma was kind, and wouldn't have pussy beaten, and pussy's feelings  wouldn't be hurt, either, by the suspicion.    She hurried out in search of the cat, found her in the hall, pounced on  her, carried her into the dressing-room, and left her there with all the  doors shut, so that she could not escape, till some one going in would  find the bottle broken, and think the cat had done it.    This accomplished, Gracie went back to the play-room and tried to forget  her wrong-doing in the interesting employment of dressing her dolls.    Lulu presently left her carving and joined her. Max had gone for a ride.    While chasing the cat Gracie had not perceived a little woolly head thrust  out of a door at the farther end of the hall, its keen black eyes closely  watching her movements.    \"He, he, he!\" giggled the owner of the head, as Gracie secured pussy and  hurried into the dressing-room with her, \"wondah what she done dat fer!\"    \"What you talkin' 'bout, you sassy niggah?\" asked Agnes, coming up behind  her on her way to Mrs. Raymond's apartments with another basket of clean  clothes, just as Gracie reappeared and hurried up the stairs to the story  above.\"    \"Why, Miss Gracie done come pounce on ole Tab while she paradin' down de  hall, and ketch her up an' tote her off into Miss Wilet's dressin'-room,  an's lef her dar wid de do' shut on her. What for you s'pose she done do  dat?\"    \"Oh, go 'long! I don' b'lieve Miss Gracie didn't do no sich ting!\"  returned Agnes.    \"She did den, I seed her,\" asserted the little maid positively. \"Mebbe she  heerd de mices runnin' 'round an want ole Tab for to ketch 'em.\"    \"You go 'long and 'tend to yo' wuk. Bet, you lazy niggah,\" responded  Agnes, pushing past her. \"Miss Wilet an Miss Gracie dey'll min' dere own  consarns widout none o' yo' help.\"    The child made no reply, but stole on tiptoe after Agnes.    Violet was coming up the front stairway, and reached the door of her  dressing-room, just in advance of the girl. Opening it she exclaimed at  the powerful perfume which greeted her nostrils, then catching sight of  the bottle lying in fragments on the floor.    \"Who can have done this?\" she asked in a tone of surprise not wholly free  from displeasure.    \"De cat, mos' likely, Miss Wilet,\" said Agnes, setting down her basket and  glancing at puss who was stretched comfortably on the rug before the fire.  \"I s'pect she's been running ober de bureau, like I see her do, mor'n  once 'fo' dis.\"    \"She looks very quiet now,\" remarked Violet, \"and if she did the mischief  it was certainly not intentional. But don't leave her shut up here again,  Agnes.\"    \"She didn't do it, Agnes didn't,\" volunteered Betty, who had stolen in  after them; \"it was Miss Gracie, Miss Wilet, I seed her ketch ole Tab out  in de hall dere, and put her in hyar, an' shut de do "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#19)"],[1,"had invited the holy Fatima  to stay with her, and that she was now in the palace; and at the request  of the prince, ordered her to be summoned to her at once.    When the pretended Fatima came, Aladdin said, \"Come hither, good mother;  I am glad to see you here at so fortunate a time. I am tormented with a  violent pain in my head, and request your assistance, and hope you will  not refuse me that cure which you impart to afflicted persons.\" So  saying, he arose, but held down his head. The counterfeit Fatima  advanced toward him, with his hand all the time on a dagger concealed in  his girdle under his gown; which Aladdin, observing, he snatched the  weapon from his hand, pierced him to the heart with his own dagger, and  then pushed him down on the floor.    \"My dear prince, what have you done?\" cried the princess, in surprise.  \"You have killed the holy woman!\" \"No, my princess,\" answered Aladdin  with emotion, \"I have not killed Fatima, but a villain, who would have  assassinated me, if I had not prevented him. This wicked man,\" added he,  uncovering his face, \"is the brother of the magician who attempted our  ruin. He has strangled the true Fatima, and disguised himself in her  clothes with intent to murder me.\" Aladdin then informed her how the  genie had told him these facts, and how narrowly she and the palace had  escaped destruction through his treacherous suggestion which had led to  her request.    Thus was Aladdin delivered from the persecution of the two brothers, who  were magicians. Within a few years afterward, the sultan died in a good  old age, and as he left no male children, the Princess Buddir al Buddoor  succeeded him, and she and Aladdin reigned together many years, and left  a numerous and illustrious posterity.          CHAPTER VI    THE HISTORY OF ALI BABA, AND OF THE FORTY ROBBERS KILLED BY ONE SLAVE      There once lived in a town of Persia two brothers, one named Cassim and  the other Ali Baba. Their father divided a small inheritance equally  between them. Cassim married a very rich wife, and became a wealthy  merchant. Ali Baba married a woman as poor as himself, and lived by  cutting wood, and bringing it upon three asses into the town, to sell.    One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, and had just cut wood enough  to load his asses, he saw at a distance a great cloud of dust, which  seemed to approach him. He observed it with attention, and distinguished  soon after a body of horsemen, who he suspected might be robbers. He  determined to leave his asses to save himself. He climbed up a large  tree, planted on a high rock, whose branches were thick enough to  conceal him, and yet enabled him to see all that passed without being  discovered.    The troop, who were to the number of forty, all well mounted and armed,  came to the foot of the rock on which the tree stood, and there  dismounted Every man unbridled his horse, tied him to some shrub, and  hung about his neck a bag of corn which they brought behind them. Then  each of them took off his saddle-bag, which seemed to Ali Baba to be  full of gold and silver from its weight. One, whom he took to be their  captain, came under the tree in which Ali Baba was concealed; and making  his way through some shrubs, pronounced these words: \"Open, Sesame!\"  [Footnote: \"Sesame\" is a small grain.] As soon as the captain of the  robbers had thus spoken, a door opened in the rock; and after he had  made all his troop enter before him, he followed them, when the door  shut again of itself.    The robbers stayed some time within the rock, during which Ali Baba,  fearful of being caught, remained in the tree.    At last the door opened again, and as the captain went in last, so he  came out first, and stood to see them all pass by him; when Ali Baba  heard him make the door close by pronouncing these words, \"Shut,  Sesame!\" Every man at once went and bridled his horse, fastened his  wallet, and mounted again. When the captain saw them all ready, he put  himself at their head, and they returned the way they had come.    Ali Baba followed them with his eyes as far as he could see them; and  afterward stayed a considerable time before he descended. Remembering  the words the captain of the robbers used to cause the door to open and  shut, he had the curiosity to try if his pronouncing them would have the  same effect. Accordingly, he went among the shrubs, and perceiving the  door concealed behind them, stood before it, and said, \"Open, Sesame!\"  The door instantly flew wide open.    Ali Baba, who expected a dark, dismal cavern, was surprised to see a  well-lighted and spacious chamber, which received the light from an  opening at the top of the rock, and in which were all sorts of  provisions, rich bales of silk, stuff, brocade, and valuable carpeting,  piled upon one another; gold and silver ingots in great heaps, and money  in bags. The sight of all these riches made him suppose that this cave  must have been occupied for ages by robbers, who had succeeded one  another.    Ali Baba went boldly into the cave, and collected as much of the gold  coin, which was in bags, as he thought his three asses could carry. When  he had loaded them with the bags, he laid wood over them in such a  manner that they could not be seen. When he had passed in and out as  often as he wished, he stood before the door, and pronouncing the words,  \"Shut, Sesame!\" the door closed of itself. He then made the best of his  way to town.    When Ali Baba got home, he drove his asses into a little yard, shut the  gates very carefully, threw off the wood that covered the panniers,  carried the bags into his house, and ranged them in order before his  wife. He then emptied the bags, which raised such a great heap of gold  as dazzled his wife's eyes, and then he told her the whole adventure  from beginning to end, and, above all, recommended her to keep it  secret.    The wife rejoiced greatly in their good fortune, and would count all the  gold piece by piece. \"Wife,\" replied Ali Baba, \"you do not know what you  undertake, when you pretend to count the money; you will never have  done. I will dig a hole, and bury it. There is no time to be lost.\" \"You  are in the right, husband,\" replied she, \"but let us know, as nigh as  possible, how much we have. I will borrow a small measure, and measure  it, while you dig the hole.\"    Away the wife ran to her brother-in-law Cassim, who lived just by, and  addressing herself to his wife, desired her to lend her a measure for a  little while. Her sister-in-law asked her whether she would have a great  or a small one. The other asked for a small one. She bade her stay a  little, and she would readily fetch one,    The sister-in-law did so, but as she knew Ali Baba's poverty, she was  curious to know what sort of grain his wife wanted to measure, and  artfully putting some suet at the bottom of the measure, brought it to  her, with an excuse that she was sorry that she had made her stay so  long, but that she could not find it sooner.    Ali Baba's wife went home, set the measure upon the heap of gold, filled  it, and emptied it often upon the sofa, till she had done, when she was  very well satisfied to find the number of measures amounted to so many  as they did, and went to tell her husband, who had almost finished  digging the hole. While Ali Baba was burying the gold, his wife, to show  her exactness and diligence to her sister-in-law, carried the measure  back again, but without taking notice that a piece of gold had stuck to  the bottom. \"Sister,\" said she, giving it to her again, \"you see that I  have not kept your measure long. I am obliged to you for it, and return  it with thanks.\"    As soon as Ali Baba's wife was gone, Cassim's looked at the bottom of  the measure, and was in inexpressible surprise to find a piece of gold  sticking to it. Envy immediately possessed her breast. \"What!\" said she,  \"has Ali Baba gold so plentiful as to measure it? Whence has he all this  wealth?\"    Cassim, her husband, was at his counting-house. When he came home, his  wife said to him, \"Cassim, I know you think yourself rich, but Ali Baba  is infinitely richer than you. He does not count his money, but measures  it.\" Cassim desired her to explain the riddle, which she did, by telling  him the stratagem she had used to make the discovery, and showed him the  piece of money, which was so old that they could not tell in what  prince's reign it was coined.    Cassim, after he had married the rich widow, had never treated Ali Baba  as a brother, but neglected him; and now, instead of being pleased, he  conceived a base envy at his brother's prosperity. He could not sleep  all that night, and went to him in the morning before sunrise. \"Ali  Baba,\" said he, \"I am surprised at you; you pretend to be miserably  poor, and yet you measure gold. My wife found this at the bottom of the  measure you borrowed yesterday.\"    By this discourse, Ali Baba perceived that Cassim and his wife, through  his own wife's folly, knew what they had so much reason to conceal; but  what was done, could not be undone. Therefore, without showing the least  surprise or trouble, he confessed all, and offered his brother part of  his treasure to keep the secret.    \"I expect as much,\" replied Cassim haughtily; \"but I must know exactly  where this treasure is, and how I may visit it myself when I choose;  otherwise, I will go and inform against you, and then you will not only  get no more, but will lose all you have, and I shall have a share for my  information.\"    Ali Baba told him all he desired, even to the very words he was to use  to gain admission into the cave.    Cassim rose the next morning long before the sun, and set out for the  forest with ten mules bearing great chests, which he designed to fill,  and followed the road which Ali Baba had pointed out to him. He was not  long before he reached the rock, and found out the place, by the tree  and other marks "]]]
