The announcement had been made rather late, so most of the form already  had engagements for the holiday. Only six hands were raised, belonging  respectively to Ingred Saxon, Avie Irving, Avis Marlowe, Francie Hall,  Bess Haselford, and Beatrice Jackson herself.    \"A poor muster for Va!\" remarked Kitty. \"As Ingred's our  warden, I should think she'd better write the report.\"    \"The Finbury ground is a horribly awkward place to get to,\" put in  Beatrice. \"I suppose you'll motor there, Ingred.\"    \"We have no car now,\" confessed Ingred, turning very red, for she was  sure that Beatrice knew that fact only too well, and had brought it into  prominence on purpose to humiliate her.    \"Oh! I suppose you'll be motoring, Bess? Couldn't you give some of us a  lift?\"    \"I believe I could take you all,\" replied Bess pleasantly. \"Of course I  shall have to ask Dad first if I may have the car out on Saturday, but I  don't expect he'll say no.\"    \"Oh, what sport! We'll come, you bet. Look here, I beg to propose that  Bess Haselford writes the report of the match.\"    \"And I second it,\" declared Francie. \"Hands up, girls! Bess shall be  'boss' for this show.\"    Half the girls in the room had not heard Kitty's proposal that Ingred  should be chosen, and some of the others, listening imperfectly, had  gathered that she was not able to go to the match, so without giving her  a further thought they raised hands in favor of Bess, and the matter was  carried.    \"But indeed I'm no good at writing or describing things!\" protested  Bess.    \"Yes, you are! You've got to try, so there!\" cried her friends  triumphantly. \"You'll do it just as well as anybody else would.\"    Ingred turned away with a red-hot spot raging under her blouse. That  she, the warden of the form, should have been passed over in favor of a  girl whose sole qualification seemed to be that she could offer some of  the others a lift in her car, was a very nasty knock. Was Bess to  supplant her in everything?    \"Perhaps you'd like to make her warden instead of me!\" she remarked  bitterly to Belle Charlton, who stood near. \"I'm perfectly willing to  resign if you're tired of me!\"    Belle only giggled and poked Joanna Powers, who said:    \"Don't be nasty, Ingred! Bess is a sport, and we most of us like her.\"    \"I can't see the attraction myself!\" snapped Ingred.    She did not want to go to the hockey match now, and made up her mind  obstinately that nothing in this wide world should decoy her to it. Bess  came to school next morning armed with full permission to use her  father's car and to invite as many of her schoolfellows as it would  accommodate. She cordially pressed Ingred to join the party.    \"I'm not going to the match, thanks,\" replied the latter frigidly.    \"But there's heaps of room--there is indeed, without a frightful  squash.\"    \"There's something I want to do at home on Saturday.\"    \"Couldn't you do it in the morning? The form will be disappointed if you  don't go--and, I say----\" (shyly) \"I wish you'd write that wretched  report instead of me. I hate the idea of doing it!\"    \"The form won't care twopence whether I go or stay away, and as they've  chosen you to write the report you'll have to write it or it'll be left  undone,\" retorted Ingred perversely.    Bess, looking decidedly hurt, turned away. Her little efforts at  friendship with Ingred were invariably met in this most ungracious  fashion. She could not understand why her kindly-meant advances should  always be so systematically repulsed. Ingred, on her part, stalked off  with the mean feeling of one who at bottom knows she is in the wrong,  but won't acknowledge it even to herself. Under the sub-current of  indignation she realized that she would have liked Bess immensely if  only the latter had not taken up her residence at Rotherwood. That,  however, was an offense which she deemed it quite impossible ever to  forgive.    Ingred went about her work that morning in a very scratchy mood, so much  so as to attract the attention of Miss Strong, who possibly felt a  little prickly herself, since even teachers have their phases of temper.  It was at that time a fashion in the form for the girls to keep all  sorts of absurd mascots inside their desks, the collecting and  comparison of which afforded them huge satisfaction. Now Miss Strong  happened to be lecturing on \"The Age of Elizabeth,\" a subject so  congenial to her that she was generally most interesting. But to-day she  had reached a rather dry and arid portion of that famous reign, and even  her powers of description failed for once and the lesson became a mere  catalogue of events and dates. Ingred, bored stiff with listening,  secretly opened her desk, and, taking a selection of treasures from it,  began to fondle them surreptitiously upon her lap. It was, of course, a  quite illegal thing to do. She glanced at them occasionally, but for the  most part kept her eyes upon her teacher. Beatrice, however, who sat  near and had an excellent view of Ingred's lap, gazed at it with such  persistent and marked attention that she attracted the notice of Miss  Strong, who followed the direction of her looks and pounced upon the  offender.    \"Ingred Saxon, what have you there? Bring those things to me immediately  and put them on my desk!\"    With a crimson face Ingred obeyed, and handed over into the teacher's  custody:        1. A black velvet cat.        2. A small golliwog.        3. A piece of four-leaved clover.        4. A stone with a hole in it.        5. An ivory pig.    Miss Strong smiled cynically.    \"At fifteen years of age,\" she remarked, \"I should have thought a girl  would have advanced a little further than playthings of this  description. The Kindergarten would evidently be a more fit form for you  than Va! You lose five order marks.\"    Five order marks! Ingred gasped with amazed indignation. One at a time  was the usual forfeit, but to lose five \"at one fell swoop\" seemed  excessive, and would make a considerable difference to her weekly  record. She blazed against the injustice. No girl in the form had ever  had so severe punishment.    \"Oh, Miss Strong!\" she protested hotly. \"_Five!_ I haven't really done  anything more than heaps of the others. It's not fair!\"    Now if Ingred had really hoped to get her sentence remitted she could  not have done a more absolutely suicidal thing. A mistress may overlook  some faults, but she will not stand \"cheek.\" The discipline of the form  was at stake, and Miss Strong was not a mistress to be trifled with. Her  little figure absolutely quivered with dignity, and though physically  she was shorter than her pupil, morally she seemed to tower yards. She  fixed her clear dark eyes in a kind of hypnotic stare on Ingred and  remarked witheringly:    \"That will do! I don't allow _any_ girl to speak to me in this fashion!  You'll take a cross for conduct as well as losing the five order marks.  You may go to your seat now.\"    Ingred walked back to her desk covered with humiliation. To be publicly  rebuked before the whole form was an unpleasant experience, particularly  for a warden. Beatrice, Francie, and several others were holding up  self-righteous noses, though their desks contained an equal assortment  of mascots. Ingred, still seething, made little attempt to listen to the  rest of the lecture, and was obliged to pass the questions which came to  her afterwards on the subject-matter. She was heartily thankful when  eleven o'clock brought the brief ten minutes \"break.\"    \"Well, you _have_ been a lunatic this morning!\" said Beatrice, passing  her, biscuits in hand, in the cloak-room. \"What possessed you to go and  lose the tennis-court for the form?\"    \"If you hadn't stared so hard at me Miss Strong would never have  noticed.\"    \"Oh, of course! Throw the blame on somebody else! You're always the  'little white hen that never lays astray.'\"    \"Kitty and Evie and Belle and I had arranged a set!\" grumbled Cicely  Denham. \"It's most unfair, this rule of punishing the whole form for  what one girl does!\"    \"Go and tell Miss Burd so then!\" flared Ingred. \"It hasn't been very  successful so far to tell teachers they're not fair, but you may have  better luck than I had. She'll probably say: 'Oh, yes, Cicely dear, I'll  rearrange the rules at once!' So like her, isn't it?\"    \"Now you're sark! Almost as sarky as the Snark herself!\" commented  Cicely, as Ingred, choking over a last biscuit, stumped away.    There is much written nowadays about the unconscious power of thought  waves, and certainly one grumbler can often spread dissatisfaction  through an entire community. Perhaps the black looks which Ingred  encountered from the disappointed tennis-players in her form turned into  naughty sprites who whispered treason in the ears of the juniors, or  perhaps it was a mere coincidence that mutiny suddenly broke out in the  Lower School. It began with a company of ten-year-olds who, with pencil  boxes and drawing books, were being escorted by Althea Riley, one of the  prefects, along the corridor to the studio. Hitherto, by dint of  judicious curbing, they had always walked two and two in decent line and  had refrained from prohibited conversation. To-day they surged upstairs  in an unseemly rabble, chattering and talking like a flock of rooks or  jackdaws at sunset. It was in vain that Althea tried to restore order,  her efforts at discipline were simply scouted by the unruly mob, who  rushed into the studio helter-skelter, took their places anyhow, and  only controlled themselves at the entrance of Miss Godwin, the art  mistress.    Althea, flushed, indignant, and most upset, sought her fellow-prefects.    \"Shall I go and complain to Miss Burd?\" she asked.    \"Um--I don't think I should yet,\" said Lispeth a little doubtfully. \"You  see, Miss Burd has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#19)"],[1,"ods, but in the meantime this chapter will help you  to know some of them. _The italicized names are of the things I know to  be edible from personal experience._ You are probably well acquainted  with the common wild fruits such as the raspberry, strawberry,  blackberry, blueberry, and huckleberry, but there are varieties of these  and all will bear description.      =Red Raspberry=    The wild berry often has a more delicious flavor and perfume than the  cultivated one of the same species. Nothing can approach the wonderful  and delicate flavor of the little wild strawberry, unless it is the wild  red raspberry; and the fully ripe wild blackberry holds a spicy  sweetness that makes the garden blackberry taste tame and flat in  comparison.    The _wild red raspberry_ is found in open fields and growing along  fences and the sides of the road. The flowers are white and grow in  loose clusters, while the berry, when fully ripe, is a deep, translucent  red. The bush is shrubby, is generally about waist-high, and the stems  bear small, hooked prickles. The leaves are what is called compound,  being composed of three or five leaflets, usually three, which branch  out from the main stem like the leaves of the rose-bush. The edges of  the leaves are irregularly toothed.    The berry is cup-shaped and fits over a core which is called the  receptacle, and from which it loosens when ripe to drop easily into your  hand, leaving the receptacle and calyx on the stem. The sweet,  far-carrying perfume of the gathered wild red raspberry will always  identify it. The season for fruit is July and August.      =Black Raspberry=    The growth and leaves of the _wild black raspberry_ are like those of  the red raspberry, and it is found in the same localities. The fruit,  like the other, is cup or thimble shaped and grows on a receptacle from  which it loosens when fully ripe. Blackcaps, these berries are often  called. They ripen in July. The berry is sometimes a little dry, but the  flavor is sweet and fine.      =Purple-Flowering Raspberry=    The purple-flowering raspberry is acid and insipid; it can hardly be  called edible, though it is not poisonous. You will find it clambering  among the rocks on the mountainside and in rocky soil. The leaves are  large and resemble grape leaves, while the flower is large, purplish-red  in color, and grows in loose clusters.      =Mountain Raspberry, Cloudberry=    The usual home of the mountain raspberry, or cloudberry, is on the  mountain-tops among the clouds. You will find it in the White Mountains  and on the coast of Maine, and it has recently been discovered at  Montauk Point, L. I. The fruit has a pleasant flavor of a honey-like  sweetness. The receptacle of the berry is broad and flat, the color is  yellow touched with red where exposed to the sun. It does not grow in  clusters like the other raspberries, but is solitary. The leaves are  roundish with from five to nine lobes, something like the leaves of the  geranium. The plant grows low, is without prickles, and the solitary  flowers are white. In the far north, where it is found in great  profusion, the cloudberry is made into delicious jam.      =Wild Strawberry=    When crossing sandy knolls or open, uncultivated fields and pastures,  the alluring perfume of the _wild strawberry_ will sometimes lead you to  the patch which shows the bright-red little berry on its low-growing  plant. It is common everywhere, though it bears the name of wild  Virginia strawberry. In Latin it is most appropriately called  _Fragaria_, meaning fragrant. The leaves are compound with three  coarsely toothed, hairy leaflets. The small white flowers grow in sparse  clusters on rather long, hairy stems. They have many deep yellow stamens  which are surrounded by the fine white petals. In fruiting time the  leaves are often bright-red.      =Low Running Blackberry=    Among the mountains and hills, down in the valleys, and on the plains;  straggling along roadsides, clinging to fence rails, and sprawling over  rocks, you will find the wild blackberry. There are several varieties,  and blackberries of some kind are common throughout the United States.    The _low running blackberry_ belongs to the dewberry type and bears the  largest and juiciest berries. It is a trailing vine with compound leaves  of from four to seven leaflets which are double-toothed. The berries are  black and glossy and grow in small clusters. They are sweet and pulpy  when thoroughly ripe and the best ones are those which ripen slowly  under the shelter of the leaves.    Blackberries grow on a receptacle or core, but unlike the raspberry,  they do not separate from it. When ripe they drop easily from the calyx  carrying the receptacle with them. The flowers are small and white, and  grow in clusters.      =Running Swamp Blackberry=    Perhaps you have seen the blackberry with fruit so small it seems only  partially developed and, like myself, have hesitated to taste it, not  being sure that it was a true blackberry and edible. It takes a good  many of these little berries to make a mouthful, but they are harmless.  They are called the _running swamp blackberry_. They ripen in August and  grow in sandy places as well as in the swamps. There are three leaflets,  seldom more, to the stem, which are blunt at the tip, smooth, shining,  and coarsely toothed. The flowers are small and white, and the stems  prickly.      =High-Bush Blackberry=    Throughout the northern states as far west as Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri  and down to North Carolina, you may find the _high-bush blackberry_. Its  stems are sometimes ten feet high; they are furrowed and thorny and the  bush grows along country roads, by fences, and in the woods. The berries  are sweet, but quite seedy. They grow in long, loose clusters and ripen  in July.      =Mountain Blackberry=    There is another variety called the _mountain blackberry_. It has a  spicy flavor, but the fruit is small and dry. The leaves are more  elongated toward the tip than those of the others and they are finely  toothed. The branches are reddish in color.      =Thornless Blackberry=    The sweetest of all varieties is said to be the thornless blackberry. It  ripens later than the others and has no thorns. The leaves are long and  narrow.      =Eastern Wild Gooseberry=    Among the mountains from Massachusetts to North Carolina, the eastern  wild gooseberry grows. It is said that its flavor is delicious. The  fruit is purplish in color and is free from all prickles. It grows on  slender stems and, like the cultivated gooseberry, is tipped with the  dry calyx. The leaves are small, rather round, and have three or five  lobes. The flowers are greenish and insignificant. The plant is three or  four feet high, with spreading branches and smooth stems.    [Illustration: WALNUT    HIGH-BUSH BLUEBERRY    WINTERGREEN    Good food on the trail.]      =Dwarf Blueberry=    Perhaps the most satisfactory of all berries when one is really hungry  is the blueberry, of which there are several varieties. The _dwarf  blueberry_ is probably the most common. It is the earliest of the  blueberries to ripen and grows in the thin, sandy, and rocky soil which  is spurned by most other plants. You will find it upon barren hillsides,  in rocky fields, and in dry pine woods. The berries are round, blue,  about the size of peas, and are covered with bloom like the grape. They  grow in thick clusters at the end of the branch and are tipped with fine  calyx teeth. The seeds are so small as to be almost unnoticed and the  soft ripe berry will bruise easily.    The flavor of all blueberries has a nutty quality which seems to give  the berry more substance as a food. The leaf is rather narrow and  pointed at each end; the under side is a lighter green than the upper  and both are glossy. In the fall the leaves turn red and drop easily.  The bush is low and the branches usually covered with small, white dots.      =Low Blueberry=    Another variety is called the _low blueberry_. It is very much like the  dwarf blueberry, but the bush grows sometimes as high as four feet. It  is stiff and upstanding and prefers the edge of the woods and sheltered  roadsides to the dry open fields. The berries are blue with a grape-like  bloom and, like the first variety, grow in thick clusters at the end of  the branch. You can grab a good handful in passing, so many are there in  a bunch.      =High-Bush Blueberry=    On the _high-bush blueberry_ the color of the berries varies. Some  bushes bear a black, shiny berry, others a smooth, blue, and still  others blue with a bloom. The sizes differ also. The berries grow in  clusters, at times on branches almost bare of leaves; some are sweet,  others sour. The leaves are a pointed oval with the under side lighter  in color than the upper; in some cases the under side is hairy. The  flowers are pinkish and shaped somewhat like a cylinder. The bush grows  occasionally to the height of ten feet, and you will generally find it  in marshy places. I know that it grows by the edge of Teedyuskung Lake  in Pike County, Pa., where our summer camp is located, but it is found  also in pasturelands.      =Dangleberry=    Another variety is called the dangleberry. The berries grow on stems in  loose clusters; they are rather large, of a dark-blue color with a  bloom; they ripen late and are not very plentiful. The pale-green leaves  are large, white, and resinous underneath, and are oval in shape. The  flowers are greenish-pink and hang like bells on slender stems.      =Wintergreen. Checkerberry=    Almost every one knows the little cherry-red _wintergreen berry_ or  _checkerberry_, and almost every one likes its sweet aromatic flavor but  few would care to make a meal of it. The fruit is too dry for hearty  eating and the flavor too decided. The evergreen leaves are leathery in  texture and their flavor is stronger than that of the berry; they are  whitish underneath "]]]
