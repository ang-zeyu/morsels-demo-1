Among all the events of the Old French War, Grandfather thought that there  was none more interesting than the removal of the inhabitants of Acadia.  From the first settlement of this ancient province of the French, in 1604,  until the present time, its people could scarcely ever know what kingdom  held dominion over them. They were a peaceful race, taking no delight in  warfare, and caring nothing for military renown. And yet, in every war,  their region was infested with iron-hearted soldiers, both French and  English, who fought one another for the privilege of ill treating these  poor harmless Acadians. Sometimes the treaty of peace made them subjects  of one king, sometimes of another.    At the peace of 1748, Acadia had been ceded to England. But the French  still claimed a large portion of it, and built forts for its defence. In  1755, these forts were taken, and the whole of Acadia was conquered, by  three thousand men from Massachusetts, under the command of General  Winslow. The inhabitants were accused of supplying the French with  provisions, and of doing other things that violated their neutrality.    \"These accusations were probably true,\" observed Grandfather; \"for the  Acadians were descended from the French, and had the same friendly  feelings towards them, that the people of Massachusetts had for the  English. But their punishment was severe. The English determined to tear  these poor people from their native homes and scatter them abroad.\"    The Acadians were about seven thousand in number. A considerable part of  them were made prisoners, and transported to the English colonies. All  their dwellings and churches were burnt, their cattle were killed, and the  whole country was laid waste, so that none of them might find shelter or  food in their old homes, after the departure of the English. One thousand  of the prisoners were sent to Massachusetts; and Grandfather allowed his  fancy to follow them thither, and tried to give his auditors an idea of  their situation.    We shall call this passage the story of        THE ACADIAN EXILES      A sad day it was for the poor Acadians, when the armed soldiers drove  them, at the point of the bayonet, down to the sea-shore. Very sad were  they, likewise, while tossing upon the ocean, in the crowded transport  vessels. But, methinks, it must have been sadder still, when they were  landed on the Long Wharf, in Boston, and left to themselves, on a foreign  strand.    Then, probably, they huddled together, and looked into one another's faces  for the comfort which was not there. Hitherto, they had been confined on  board of separate vessels, so that they could not tell whether their  relatives and friends were prisoners along with them. But, now, at least,  they could tell that many had been left behind, or transported to other  regions.    Now, a desolate wife might be heard calling for her husband. He, alas! had  gone, she knew not whither, or perhaps had fled into the woods of Acadia,  and had now returned to weep over the ashes of their dwelling. An aged  widow was crying out, in a querulous, lamentable tone, for her son, whose  affectionate toil had supported her for many a year. He was not in the  crowd of exiles; and what could this aged widow do but sink down and die?  Young men and maidens, whose hearts had been torn asunder by separation,  had hoped, during the voyage, to meet their beloved ones at its close.  Now, they began to feel that they were separated forever. And, perhaps, a  lonesome little girl, a golden-haired child of five years old, the very  picture of our little Alice, was weeping and wailing for her mother, and  found not a soul to give her a kind word.    Oh, how many broken bonds of affection were here! Country lost!--friends  lost!--their rural wealth of cottage, field, and herds, all lost together!  Every tie between these poor exiles and the world seemed to be cut off at  once. They must have regretted that they had not died before their exile;  for even the English would not have been so pitiless as to deny them  graves in their native soil. The dead were happy; for they were not  exiles!    While they thus stood upon the wharf, the curiosity and inquisitiveness of  the New England people would naturally lead them into the midst of the  poor Acadians. Prying busy-bodies thrust their heads into the circle,  wherever two or three of the exiles were conversing together. How puzzled  did they look, at the outlandish sound of the French tongue! There were  seen the New England women, too. They had just come out of their warm,  safe homes, where every thing was regular and comfortable, and where their  husbands and children would be with them at night-fall. Surely, they could  pity the wretched wives and mothers of Acadia! Or, did the sign of the  cross, which the Acadians continually made upon their breasts, and which  was abhorred by the descendants of the Puritans--did that sign exclude all  pity?    Among the spectators, too, was the noisy brood of Boston school-boys, who  came running, with laughter and shouts, to gaze at this crowd of oddly  dressed foreigners. At first they danced and capered around them, full of  merriment and mischief. But the despair of the Acadians soon had its  effect upon these thoughtless lads, and melted them into tearful sympathy.    At a little distance from the throng, might be seen the wealthy and  pompous merchants, whose warehouses stood on Long Wharf. It was difficult  to touch these rich men's hearts; for they had all the comforts of the  world at their command; and when they walked abroad, their feelings were  seldom moved, except by the roughness of the pavement, irritating their  gouty toes. Leaning upon their gold-headed canes, they watched the scene  with an aspect of composure. But, let us hope, they distributed some of  their superfluous coin among these hapless exiles, to purchase food and a  night's lodging.    After standing a long time at the end of the wharf, gazing seaward, as if  to catch a glimpse of their lost Acadia, the strangers began to stray into  the town.    They went, we will suppose, in parties and groups, here a hundred, there a  score, there ten, there three or four, who possessed some bond of unity  among themselves. Here and there was one, who, utterly desolate, stole  away by himself, seeking no companionship.    Whither did they go? I imagine them wandering about the streets, telling  the town's-people, in outlandish, unintelligible words, that no earthly  affliction ever equalled what had befallen them. Man's brotherhood with  man was sufficient to make the New Englanders understand this language.  The strangers wanted food. Some of them sought hospitality at the doors of  the stately mansions, which then stood in the vicinity of Hanover Street  and the North Square. Others were applicants at the humble wooden  tenements, where dwelt the petty shop-keepers and mechanics. Pray Heaven,  that no family in Boston turned one of these poor exiles from their door!  It would be a reproach upon New England--a crime worthy of heavy  retribution--if the aged women and children, or even the strong men, were  allowed to feel the pinch of hunger.    Perhaps some of the Acadians, in their aimless wanderings through the  town, found themselves near a large brick edifice, which was fenced in  from the street by an iron railing, wrought with fantastic figures. They  saw a flight of red freestone steps, ascending to a portal, above which  was a balcony and balustrade. Misery and desolation give men the right of  free passage everywhere. Let us suppose, then, that they mounted the  flight of steps, and passed into the Province House. Making their way into  one of the apartments, they beheld a richly clad gentleman, seated in a  stately chair, with gilding upon the carved work of its back, and a gilded  lion's head at the summit. This was Governor Shirley, meditating upon  matters of war and state, in Grandfather's chair!    If such an incident did happen, Shirley, reflecting what a ruin of  peaceful and humble hopes had been wrought by the cold policy of the  statesman, and the iron hand of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral  from it. It should have taught him that the poor man's hearth is sacred,  and that armies and nations have no right to violate it. It should have  made him feel, that England's triumph, and increased dominion, could not  compensate to mankind, nor atone to Heaven, for the ashes of a single  Acadian cottage. But it is not thus that statesmen and warriors moralize.    \"Grandfather,\" cried Laurence, with emotion trembling in his voice, \"did  iron-hearted War itself ever do so hard and cruel a thing as this before?\"    \"You have rend in history, Laurence, of whole regions wantonly laid  waste,\" said Grandfather. \"In the removal of the Acadians, the troops were  guilty of no cruelty or outrage, except what was inseparable from the  measure.\"    Little Alice, whose eyes had, all along, been brimming full of tears, now  burst forth a-sobbing; for Grandfather had touched her sympathies more  than he intended.    \"To think of a whole people, homeless in the world!\" said Clara, with  moistened eyes. \"There never was any thing so sad!\"    \"It was their own fault,\" cried Charley, energetically. \"Why did not they  fight for the country where they were born? Then, if the worst had  happened to them they could only have been killed and buried there. They  would not have been exiles then!\"    \"Certainly, their lot was as hard as death,\" said Grandfather. \"All that  could be done for them, in the English provinces, was to send them to the  alms-houses, or bind them out to task-masters."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#19)"],[1,",  his egotism and impatience, his lack of power to adapt himself even  temporarily to unaccustomed conditions, it will be remembered that these  defects were inherent and that his marvellous success in life had  accentuated them. The acts of a public man are so variously regarded by  his opponents and his admirers, are seen by them in such different  lights, that there can rarely be any general agreement on the question  of the ratio between his merits and his failings; but the chief phases  of his life afford the raw material out of which each man for himself  can form an estimate of his character.    Like many men who have afterwards become famous in the secular world,  Cecil Rhodes was intended for the Church. His health suffered from the  rigours of the East Anglian climate and he was sent out to South Africa.  His brother's farm in Natal, to which he was consigned, he found  derelict on his arrival, but he was soon growing cotton on it, against  the advice of the local experts, but with eventual success. At the age  of 18 he was prospecting for diamonds at Kimberley, and forming the  opinion during a visit to the Transvaal that an insufficient proportion  of the South African Continent belonged to the British Empire. In 1872,  being then 19 years of age, he went to Oxford, but in a few months his  health broke down and another voyage to the Cape became necessary. In  1876 he returned to the University and remained there for two years when  South Africa recalled him. As soon as he could be spared he went back to  his college and, eight years after matriculation, completed his  undergraduate course. It was a high compliment to the value of a Pass  Degree at Oxford, where, however, he formed the opinion, which was not  publicly divulged until his will was opened twenty-one years later, that  Oxford Dons were \"children in finance.\"    His election to the Cape Parliament in 1881 as Member for Kimberley  placed him in a favourable position to advance his schemes for the  northward extension of the British Empire. When the trespasses and  encroachments of the Transvaal Boers beyond the limits assigned to them  under the Convention of 1884 made it advisable to incorporate  Bechuanaland he was unable to persuade the Cape Government to undertake  that responsibility, but with the assistance of Sir Hercules Robinson  and the support of Mr. Chamberlain he induced the Imperial Government to  take action. President Kruger had connived at the establishment on  native territory under British protection of two little republics of  raiders, to which the names of Goshen and Stellaland were assigned; and  a costly expedition under Sir C. Warren was needed to bring him to his  senses. In 1885 Bechuanaland became an integral part of the British  Empire.    In 1888 he again opened the flood gates of Imperialism, and secured by  means of a treaty with Lobengula the reversion of the native territory  north of the Transvaal, at which two European nations were nibbling, and  which in his honour received the name of Rhodesia.    He became Premier of the Cape Colony in 1890 by the help of the Dutch  vote and from that time gradually sank from the zenith of his success.  His good fortune left him when he attained his ambition. The Jameson  Raid, for which he was not personally, though he confessed himself  morally, responsible, ended his political career. His last good service  to the Empire was given during the Matabele rising. He accompanied the  troops sent to suppress the rebellion; and when the operations seemed  likely to be indefinitely prolonged, he brought it to an end by going  fearlessly and almost unattended among the natives, whose confidence he  won by meeting them trustfully in council and listening to their  grievances.    His physical vitality, always inadequate, was seriously impaired by the  strain of the siege. He never fully recovered his strength and he died  on March 26, 1902, two months before the Second Boer war was brought to  a close by the Vereeniging Treaty.    He was a rich but honest man, and the great wealth which he amassed  never led him to attach undue importance to the possession of it. He  valued it not for his own advantage, but for its help in advancing his  political and imperial schemes. He employed it creditably and without  ostentation, and spent none of it in social display in London. By his  will he left the greater portion of it to the University of Oxford for  the establishment of an amiable if somewhat quixotic system of bringing  the various branches of the Anglo-Saxon race into association at a  centre of learning and athletics, where they were to be leavened by a  Teutonic admixture.    The vision of posthumous reputation allured him, and he delighted in the  hope that the name of his own Rhodesia, like the cities which still bear  the name of Alexander, would be on the lips of men of generations as far  distant from his own as his own was from the days of the Great  Macedonian.    He presented a pair of sculptured lions to President Kruger. Almost on  the eve of the war he asserted confidently that Kruger would not fight.  It is probable that this was not his belief, but that it was said in  order to provoke the President into rejecting the overtures of the  British Government, and to make inevitable the war which he foresaw was  the only way of settling the South African question.    Not a few incidents in his life are difficult to explain. The donation  of £10,000 to the funds of the Parnellite Party by an ardent English  Imperialist who had never expressed any particular enthusiasm for Home  Rule may have been a _douceur_ to prevent the Irish members from  attacking him in the British Parliament. He had not forgotten that  Parnell inaugurated the policy of obstruction carried to the length of  all-night sittings upon the occasion of the discussion of a Cape  Colonial question in the House of Commons. Possibly Rhodes was a Home  Ruler not in spite of his Imperialism but because of it. Home rule was  necessary to it. The function of the Imperial Parliament was the general  control of the affairs of the Empire, leaving local politics to be dealt  with by local legislatures.    The strong and dominant personality of Cecil Rhodes came to the front at  a time when the British Empire was beginning to show signs of lassitude  and appeared to be growing tired of itself. Patriotism was being slowly  transmuted into a limp and sickly cosmopolitan altruism. He checked this  decadence, at least for the time being, but passed away before he was  able to subdue it.          CHAPTER V    A Tragedy of Errors      The lassitude induced by the battle of Colenso affected each combatant  on the Tugela. The Boers put the finishing touches to their works on the  left bank, and at their leisure continued the position across the river  eastwards from Hlangwhane. They did not seem to have been withdrawn in  force[26] to assist the besiegers of Ladysmith in the great assault on  Wagon Hill and Caesar's Camp on January 6, for a demonstration ordered  by Buller at White's request during the crisis showed that the Tugela  front was as strongly held as ever.    On January 8, Buller, whose Head Quarters were at Frere, was reinforced  by the Vth Division under Warren, and he now resumed his original plan,  out of which he had been scared by Magersfontein, of advancing on  Ladysmith by way of Potgieter's Drift, rejecting an alternative plan  proposed by Warren, which differed little from that by which the relief  of Ladysmith was effected six weeks later, of a direct advance by way of  Hlangwhane and Pieter's Hill. Between Buller's army and Ladysmith lay  not only the tortuous and difficult Tugela, but also a barrier of  heights and ridges through which there were but four or five possible  ways of access, one of which had already been tried without success, to  the beleaguered city lying on a plain considerably above the level of  the open ground on the right bank of the Tugela.    Buller, having selected the route which seemed at the time to be the  line of least resistance, began on January 9 to transfer the bulk of his  force from Frere to Springfield, a distance of sixteen miles, but owing  to difficulties of transport and the necessity of accumulating a large  stock of supplies at the new base, it was six days before the  concentration was effected. One brigade was left at Chieveley to watch  the Boer front at Colenso.    In Orders issued at Frere on January 9, Buller announced that he  \"proposed to effect the passage of the Tugela in the neighbourhood of  Potgieter's Drift, with a view to the relief of Ladysmith.\" His scheme  was based upon imperfect information and misleading maps, and was in  fact not so much a surprise flank attack, as all his movements had to be  made in full view of the enemy, as an attack from a position higher up  the river that must be frontal, because the enemy would have ample time  to make it so: and herein lay its weakness. When, however, he personally  surveyed the situation from Mount Alice, which overlooks Potgieter's  Drift, the aspect of the curving amphitheatre showed the danger of  attempting to force the river at that point. On the N.E. was Vaalkrantz  and Doornkop, and the high ridge of Brakfontein, which the enemy had  already begun to entrench, and over which passed the road by which he  proposed to reach Ladysmith, everywhere commanded by the heights, filled  the quadrant towards Spion Kop on the N.W.    On January 13, Buller reported to the War Office that, having found the  Potgieter's Drift scheme impracticable, he proposed as \"the only  possible chance for Ladysmith\" to send Warren across at Trickhardt's  Drift, five miles higher up the river. The new scheme was based upon a  theory which had been evolved out of the experiences of autumn manoeuvre  battles collated on the office desks of Pall Mall, that the easiest  method of defeating the enemy with a small"]]]
