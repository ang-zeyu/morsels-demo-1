What Germany really desired  was not freedom of the seas in peace time because the seas had been  free before the war.  What Germany wanted was free seas in war  time,--freedom for her own merchant ships to go from Germany to any  part of the world and return with everything except absolute  contraband.  Germany's object was to keep from building a navy great  enough to protect her merchant fleet in order that she might devote all  her energies to army organisation.  But the freedom of the seas was a  popular phrase.  Furthermore it explained to the German people why  their submarine warfare was not inhuman because it was really fighting  for the freedom of all nations on the high seas!    [Illustration: This is the photograph of von Hindenburg which very  German has in his home.]    While these public discussions were going on, the fight on the  Chancellor began to grow.  It was evident that when the Reichstag met  again in September that there would be bitter and perhaps a decisive  fight on von Bethmann-Hollweg.  The division in Germany became so  pronounced that people forgot for a time the old party lines and the  newspapers and party leaders spoke of the \"Bethmann parties\" and the  \"von Tirpitz party.\"  Whether the submarine should be used ruthlessly  against all shipping was the issue which divided public sentiment.  The  same democratic forces which had been supporting the Chancellor in  other fights again lined up with the Foreign Office.  The reactionaries  supported Major Bassermann, who really led the fight against the  Chancellor.  During this period the Chancellor and the Foreign Office  saw that the longer the war lasted the stronger the von Tirpitz party  would become because the people were growing more desperate and were  enthused by the propaganda cry of the Navy, \"Down with England.\"  The  Chancellor and the Foreign Office tried once more to get the world to  talk about peace.  After the presidential nominations in America the  press began to discuss the possibilities of American peace  intervention.  Every one believed that the campaign and elections in  America would have an important effect on the prospects of peace.  Theodore Wolff, editor of the Berlin _Tageblatt_, who was the  Chancellor's chief supporter in newspaper circles, began the  publication of a series of articles to explain that in the event of the  election of Charles E. Hughes, Germany would be able to count upon more  assistance from America and upon peace.  At the time the Allies were  pounding away at the Somme and every effort was being made to bring  about some kind of peace discussions when these battles were over.    On September 20th a convention of Socialists was held in Berlin for the  purpose of uniting the Socialist party in support of the Chancellor.  The whole country was watching the Socialist discussions because every  one felt that the Socialist party represented the real opinion of the  people.  After several days of discussion all factional differences  were patched up and the Socialists were ready to present a solid front  when the fight came in the Reichstag on September 28th.  On the 27th,  Berlin hotels began to buzz with excitement over the possibilities of  overthrowing the Chancellor.  The fight was led by the National  Liberals and Centre Party groups.  It was proposed by Dr. Coerting, an  industrial leader from Hannover, to move a vote of lack of confidence  in the Chancellor.  Coerting was supported by the big ammunition  interests and by the von Tirpitz crowd.  Before the Reichstag convened  the Chancellor went to Great Headquarters for a final conference with  the Kaiser and Field Marshal von Hindenburg.  Before he left it looked  as if the Chancellor would be overthrown.  But when he returned he  summoned the Reichstag leaders who were supporting him and several  editors of Liberal newspapers.  The Chancellor told them that von  Hindenburg would support him.  The next day editorials appeared in a  number of newspapers, saying that von Hindenburg and the Chancellor  were united in their ideas.  This was the most successful strategic  move the Chancellor had made, for the public had such great confidence  in von Hindenburg that when it was learned that he was opposed to von  Tirpitz the backbone of opposition to the Chancellor was broken.  On  the 28th as von Bethmann-Hollweg appeared in the Reichstag, instead of  facing a hostile and belligerent assembly, he faced members who were  ready to support him in anything he did.  The Chancellor, however,  realised that he could take some of the thunder out of the opposition  by making a strong statement against England.  \"Down with England,\" the  popular cry, was the keynote of the Chancellor's remarks.  In this one  speech he succeeded in uniting for a time at least public sentiment and  the political parties in support of the Government.    A few days afterward I saw Major Bassermann at his office in the  Reichstag and asked him whether the campaign for an unlimited submarine  warfare would be resumed after the action of the Reichstag in  expressing confidence in the Chancellor.  He said:    \"That must be decided by the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Marine and  the General Staff.  England is our chief enemy and we must recognise  this and defeat her.\"    With his hands in his pocket, his face looking down, he paced his  office and began a bitter denunciation of the neutrality of the United  States.  I asked him whether he favoured the submarine warfare even if  it brought about a break with the United States.    \"We wish to live in peace and friendship with America,\" he began, \"but  undoubtedly there is bitter feeling here because American supplies and  ammunition enable our enemies to continue the war.  If America should  succeed in forcing England to obey international law, restore freedom  of the seas and proceed with American energy against England's  brutalisation of neutrals, it would have a decisive influence on the  political situation between the two countries.  If America does not do  this then we must do it with our submarines.\"    In October I was invited by the Foreign Office to go with a group of  correspondents to Essen, Cologne and the Rhine Valley Industrial  centres.  In Essen I met Baron von Bodenhausen and other directors of  Krupps.  In Dusseldorf at the Industrie Klub I dined with the steel  magnates of Germany and at Homburg-on-the-Rhine I saw August Thyssen,  one of the richest men in Germany and the man who owns one-tenth of  Germany's coal and iron fields.  The most impressive thing about this  journey was what these men said about the necessity for unlimited  warfare.  Every man I met was opposed to the Chancellor.  They hated  him because he delayed mobilisation at the beginning of the war.  They  stated that they had urged the invasion of Belgium because if Belgium  had not been invaded immediately France could have seized the Rhine  Valley and made it impossible for Germany to manufacture war munitions  and thereby to fight a war.  They said they were in favour of an  unlimited, ruthless submarine warfare against England and all ships  going to the British Isles.  Their opinions were best represented in an  inspired editorial appearing in the _Rhieinische Westfaelische Zeitung_,  in which it was stated:      \"The war must be fought to a finish.  Either Germany or England must  win and the interests here on the Rhine are ready to fight until  Germany wins.\"      \"Do you think Germany wants war with America?\" I asked Thyssen.    \"Never!\" was his emphatic response.  \"First, because we have enemies  enough, and, secondly, because in peace times, our relations with  America are always most friendly.  We want them to continue so after  the war.\"    Thyssen's remarks could be taken on their face value were it not for  the fact that the week before we arrived in these cities General  Ludendorf, von Hindenhurg's chief assistant and co-worker, was there to  get the industrial leaders to manufacture more ammunition.  Von  Falkenhayn had made many enemies in this section because he cut down  the ammunition manufacturing until these men were losing money.  So the  first thing von Hindenburg did was to double all orders for ammunition  and war supplies and to send Ludendorf to the industrial centres to  make peace with the men who were opposed to the Government.    Thus from May to November German politics went through a period of  transformation.  No one knew exactly what would happen,--there were so  many conflicting opinions.  Political parties, industrial leaders and  the press were so divided it was evident that something would have to  be done or the German political organisation would strike a rock and go  to pieces.  The Socialists were still demanding election reforms during  the war.  The National Liberals were intriguing for a Reichstag  Committee to have equal authority with the Foreign Office in dealing  with all matters of international affairs.  The landowners, who were  losing money because the Government was confiscating so much food, were  not only criticising von Bethmann-Hollweg but holding back as much food  as they could for higher prices.  The industrial leaders, who had been  losing money because von Falkenhayn had decreased ammunition orders,  were only partially satisfied by von Hindenburg's step because they  realised that unless the war was intensified the Government would not  need such supplies indefinitely.  They saw, too, that the attitude of  President Wilson had so injured what little standing they still had in  the neutral world that unless Germany won the war in a decisive way,  their world connections would disappear forever and they would be  forced to begin all over after the war.  Faced by this predicament,  they demanded a ruthless submarine warfare against all shipping in  order that not only England but every other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"party of the officers went over to the north side of the bay,  having with them the small cutter to convey them from place to place.    Next morning, accompanied by Mr Forster, I went in the pinnace to survey  the isles and rocks which lie in the mouth of the bay. I began first with  those which lie on the S.E. side of Anchor Isle. I found here a very snug  cove sheltered from all winds, which we called Luncheon Cove, because here  we dined on cray fish, on the side of a pleasant brook, shaded by the trees  from both wind and sun. After dinner we proceeded, by rowing, out to the  outermost isles, where we saw many seals, fourteen of which we killed and  brought away with us; and might have got many more, if the surf had  permitted us to land with safety on all the rocks. The next morning, I went  out again to continue the survey, accompanied by Mr Forster. I intended to  have landed again on the Seal Isles; but there ran such a high sea that I  could not come near them. With some difficulty we rowed out to sea, and  round the S.W. point of Anchor Isle. It happened very fortunately that  chance directed me to take this course, in which we found the sportsmen's  boat adrift, and laid hold of her the very moment she would have been  dashed against the rocks. I was not long at a loss to guess how she came  there, nor was I under any apprehensions for the gentlemen that had been in  her; and after refreshing ourselves with such as we had to eat and drink,  and securing the boat in a small creek, we proceeded to the place where we  supposed them to be. This we reached about seven or eight o'clock in the  evening, and found them upon a small isle in Goose Cove, where, as it was  low water, we could not come with our boat until the return of the tide. As  this did not happen till three o'clock in the morning, we landed on a naked  beach, not knowing where to find a better place, and, after some time,  having got a fire and broiled some fish, we made a hearty supper, having  for sauce a good appetite. This done, we lay down to sleep, having a stony  beach for a bed, and the canopy of heaven for a covering. At length the  tide permitted us to take off the sportsmen; and with them we embarked, and  proceeded for the place where we had left their boat, which, we soon  reached, having a fresh breeze of wind in our favour, attended with rain.  When we came to the creek which was on the N.W. side of Anchor Isle, we  found there an immense number of blue peterels, some on the wing, others in  the woods in holes in the ground, under the roots of trees and in the  crevices of rocks, where there was no getting them, and where we supposed  their young were deposited. As not one was to be seen in the day, the old  ones were probably, at that time, out at sea searching for food, which in  the evening they bring to their young. The noise they made was like the  croaking of many frogs. They were, I believe, of the broad-bill kind,  which, are not so commonly seen at sea as the others. Here, however, they  are in great numbers, and flying much about in the night, some of our  gentlemen at first took them for bats. After restoring the sportsmen to  their boat, we all proceeded for the ship, which we reached by seven  o'clock in the morning, not a little fatigued with our expedition. I now  learned that our friends the natives returned to their habitation at night;  probably foreseeing that rain was at hand; which sort of weather continued  the whole of this day.    On the morning of the 15th, the weather having cleared up and become fair,  I set out with two boats to continue the survey of the N.W. side of the  bay, accompanied by the two Mr Forsters and several of the officers, whom I  detached in one boat to Goose Cove, where we intended to lodge the night,  while I proceeded in the other, examining the harbours and isles which lay  in my way. In the doing of this, I picked up about a score of wild fowl,  and caught fish sufficient to serve the whole party; and reaching the place  of rendezvous a little before dark, I found all the gentlemen out duck-  shooting. They however soon returned, not overloaded with game. By this  time, the cooks had done their parts, in which little art was required; and  after a hearty repast, on what the day had produced, we lay down to rest;  but took care to rise early the next morning, in order to have the other  bout among the ducks, before we left the cove.    Accordingly, at day-light, we prepared for the attack. Those who had  reconnoitred the place before, chose their stations accordingly; whilst  myself and another remained in the boat, and rowed to the head of the cove  to start the game, which we did so effectually, that, out of some scores of  ducks, we only detained one to ourselves, sending all the rest down to  those stationed below. After this I landed at the head of the cove, and  walked across the narrow isthmus that disjoins it from the sea, or rather  from another cove which runs in from the sea about one mile, and lies open  to the north winds. It, however, had all the appearance of a good harbour  and safe anchorage. At the head is a fine sandy beach, where I found an  immense number of wood hens, and brought away ten couple of them, which  recompensed me for the trouble of crossing the isthmus, through the wet  woods, up to the middle in water. About nine o'clock we all got collected  together, when the success of everyone was known, which was by no means  answerable to our expectations. The morning, indeed, was very unfavourable  for shooting, being rainy the most of the time we were out. After breakfast  we set out on our return to the ship, which we reached by seven o'clock in  the evening, with about seven dozen of wild fowl, and two seals; the most  of them shot while I was rowing about, exploring the harbours and coves  which I found in my way; every place affording something, especially to us,  to whom nothing came amiss.    It rained all the 17th, but the 18th bringing fair and clear weather, in  the evening our friends, the natives before-mentioned, paid us another  visit; and, the next morning, the chief and his daughter were induced to  come on board, while the others went out in the canoe fishing. Before they  came on board I shewed them our goats and sheep that were on shore, which  they viewed for a moment with a kind of stupid insensibility. After this I  conducted them to the brow; but before the chief set his foot upon it to  come into the ship, he took a small green branch in his hand, with which he  struck the ship's side several times, repeating a speech or prayer. When  this was over, he threw the branch into the main chains, and came on board.  This custom and manner of making peace, as it were, is practised by all the  nations in the South Seas that I have seen.    I took them both down into the cabin, where we were to breakfast. They sat  at table with us, but would not taste any of our victuals. The chief wanted  to know where we slept, and indeed to pry into every corner of the cabin,  every part of which he viewed with some surprise. But it was not possible  to fix his attention to any one thing a single moment. The works of art  appeared to him in the same light as those of nature, and were as far  removed beyond his comprehension. What seemed to strike them most was the  number and strength of our decks, and other parts of the ship. The chief,  before he came aboard, presented me with a piece of cloth and a green talc  hatchet; to Mr Forster he also gave a piece or cloth; and the girl gave  another to Mr Hodges. This custom of making presents before they receive  any, is common with the natives of the South Sea isles; but I never saw it  practised in New Zealand before. Of all the various articles I gave my  guest, hatchets and spike-nails were the most valuable in his eyes.    These he never would suffer to go out of his hands after he once laid hold  of them; whereas many other articles he would lay carelessly down any  where, and at last leave them behind him.    As soon as I could get quit of them, they were conducted into the gun-room,  where I left them, and set out with two boats to examine the head of the  bay; myself in one, accompanied by Mr Forster and Mr Hodges, and Lieutenant  Cooper in the other. We proceeded up the south side, and without meeting  with any thing remarkable, got to the head of the bay by sun-set; where we  took up our lodging for the night, at the first place we could land upon;  for the flats hindered us from getting quite to the head.    At day-light in the morning, I took two men in the small boat, and with Mr  Forster went to take a view of the flat land at the head of the bay, near  to where we spent the night. We landed on one side, and ordered the boat to  meet us on the other side; but had not been long on shore before we saw  some ducks, which, by their creeping through the bushes, we got a shot at,  and killed one. The moment we had fired, the natives, whom we had not  discovered before, set up a most hideous noise in two or three places close  by us. We hallooed in our turn; and, at the same time, retired to our boat,  which was full half a mile off. The natives kept up their clamouring noise,  but did not follow us. Indeed we found afterwards that they could not,  because of a branch of the river between us and them, nor did we find their  numbers answerable to the noise they made. As soon as we got to our boat,  and found that there was a river that would admit us, I rowed in, and was  soon after joined by Mr Cooper in the other boat. With this reinforcement I  proceeded up the river, shooting wild ducks, of which there were great  numbers; as we went along, now and then hearing the natives in the woods.  At length two appeared on the banks of the river, a man and a woman; and  the latter kept waving something white in her hand, as a sign of  friendship. Mr Cooper being near them, I called to him to"]]]
