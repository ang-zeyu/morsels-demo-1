Some of the villages have plantations and all the inhabitants seem  desirous to trade, salt being the substance usually demanded in return  for lances, knives or curios. Indeed, even our own people wish to do a  little business, and after buying articles from the villagers, try to  sell them to us at no doubt a greatly enhanced price. The higher one  travels up the river, the more numerous and densely populated are the  villages until they extend almost without a break for many miles along  the banks. Each one supplies us with a _bras_ of wood which is paid for  with beads. The scenery here in the very centre of Africa is beautiful,  range after range of hills, not however very high, extending as far as  the eye can see. These are covered with grass, which near the villages  is often burnt off, leaving black patches. On these the manioc will be  planted for two years and then new areas will be cleared in the same  manner. It is very hot in the day time and very humid, so that it is  extremely difficult to preserve anything. Stitches rot in leather and  the soles of boots fall off, guns and rifles have to be oiled carefully  every day and cigars are completely spoilt in a few hours unless kept in  tin boxes. Can one wonder therefore that the human system soon breaks  down in this vapour bath and that sickness is very common in this part.  There is not much game to be seen from the river but occasionally a  covey of partridges rises from the grass and comes within gun shot of  the launch.    The day before we reached Banzyville we found the steamer of the French  Company and paid a visit to the Director, where we drank to the  Anglo-French agreement, news of which had just arrived. Every Frenchman  in Africa is delighted with the gift of territory as every Englishman  should be with the settlement of so many prickly questions.    [Illustration: SANGO NATIVES OF THE UBANGI.]    [Illustration: THE UPPER UBANGI]          CHAPTER VI.    The Upper Ubangi.--Banzyville to Yakoma.      Banzyville has been built on a beautiful site at a double bend of the  river. Opposite is the French Post of Mobaie and between them roars a  rapid. The country on each side is hilly, while the soil is rocky, great  boulders of granite and quartz lying about in isolated grandeur. We  reach the Post on the morning of September 26th and are met by Captain  Auita, an Italian, who is the Zone Chief here. The buildings are  arranged on two sides of a square, the other two being formed by the  river as it turns to the left, and the open space is covered with gravel  which makes a welcome change from sand and clay while the house placed  at our disposal looks particularly inviting after a week of tents and  the small launch. Everything is wet through and has to be spread out on  the gravel to dry under nature's great fire. Unfortunately some of the  skins, which perforce have been left in cases for a week, under water  one minute and baked in the sun the next, have hopelessly rotted and  have to be thrown away. Next morning we interviewed numbers of native  Chiefs who were all very anxious to exchange lances and other  curiosities for European clothes. All were content with _Bulamatadi_,  although some grumbled at the necessity to find porters and paddlers.    This is evidently one of the most populous districts in the whole Congo,  for on all sides, both at the river edge and on the hill tops, are large  villages consisting of tent-shaped huts and _shimbeks_, or square open  sheds, under which the natives sit and sleep most of the day. Besides  rubber, great quantities of rice are grown here, the plantations  extending parallel to the river for more than two miles. Here men,  women, and children are at work and those near the road come forward,  give a military salute and shake hands, a custom peculiar to this part,  for hitherto the women have not saluted and only the chiefs offered the  hand. Many of the people have thin lips and Semitic noses and most are  well made. As usual, if one meets a husband and wife, the former strolls  ahead with a spear or stick, while the latter follows carrying a baby  riding on one of her hips, tied on by her wrap of cloth, and with a  heavy load of wood or food-stuff on her head. We cross the river in the  evening and dine with Captain Meilleur at Mobaie. The French villages  are identical with those on the State side, but the natives are, if  possible, still more idle.    Next morning much rubber is brought into Banzyville. Strings of natives,  each with a little basket-full of this substance, march into the square  and sit down in lines on the gravel. The baskets are then weighed on a  yard arm and the weights entered in a book by Captain Auita until a  record of the whole has been made when the chattering throng departs to  a shed near by where five cooks have been hard at work preparing dinner  for them. The natives here are paid in cloth at the rate of 50 or 60  centimes a kilogramme according to the quality of the rubber and  although each man is supposed to supply only one kilogramme a month some  of the villages here send in more than a ton in that time.    Mr. Fernaka, the second in command, arrived on the 28th after marching  for thirty days in the interior over unexplored ground. He said it was  mostly marsh land containing a few villages from which the inhabitants,  seeing the white man approach with his soldiers, fled into the bush. At  first indeed the natives are always fearful of the whites, but in a  short time are willing to trade and soon become very friendly. The  native, in fact, quickly acquires absolute confidence in Europeans and  his fear at first is, obviously, only the fear of the unknown. It is  rather amusing to see the children in villages where few white men have  penetrated, run shrieking with terror to their mothers when a strange  looking person, with a white face and clothes appears. At the sound of  the launch whistle also many children run away. One of the soldiers, a  sergeant of some years' standing who accompanied Mr. Fernaka on his  arduous march, unfortunately contracted dysentery and arrived at  Banzyville only to die. We attend the funeral, the absolute simplicity  of the ceremony being very impressive. All the troops here, perhaps  seventy or eighty marched with reversed arms to the cemetery after the  buglers sounding the Last Post and lined up opposite the grave. The  order was given to present arms, the coffin was lowered, each person  present threw a handful of earth into the grave and all was over. Far  into the night, however, one could hear the mournful dirge the soldiers  were chanting for their dead comrade. Hunting here is difficult although  game abounds, the grass being high enough to conceal antelopes and  everything else except elephants. After a walk through rough country and  water for six hours without success, I was glad to get into my hammock  and was jogged back home by perspiring natives, who took turns to carry  their burden and changed about every ten minutes. Altogether the hammock  is not comfortable, and it is obviously useless hunting here until the  grass is burnt. Next day, being very tired and stiff, I pass the time  looking through _Civilisation in Congoland_ again. Having now visited  many of the places mentioned in that book, the difficulties which beset  a writer who publishes a work on a country he has never seen, become  very apparent. In fact, it gives no more idea of the condition of the  Congo than a file of the Police News would convey an impression of  English civilisation. When one has visited some hundreds of villages and  seen perhaps a million of natives, most of whom seem cheerful and  contented, one marvels indeed how such absolutely false reports of the  condition of the country can have originated. On the other hand, it is  impossible to travel several thousands of miles in the Congo--especially  in the unfrequented parts--without constantly wondering what is the  extraordinary power which enables a few hundred white men, not only to  govern as many million blacks, but to open up and develop a country as  large as the continent of Europe, which a few years ago was absolutely  unknown.    We can dismiss at once the idea that the native is suppressed by  military despotism, for the Posts are isolated and the number of troops  in them merely sufficient to guard property and stores, that is to say,  to fulfil the duties of policemen in England. At any moment the  thousands of natives who live in or near the Posts, could overwhelm  these small forces long before help could arrive from the next  Government Station, in many cases a week's journey distant. The fact  that they do not do so, is at least negative evidence that the white men  do not ill treat the people. There is however, much positive evidence  that the native has, not only a great respect, but also an affection for  his new rulers, and it is not difficult to understand the reason, when  we compare his fate before the advent of the Europeans with his  condition at present.    In each village was a Chief or Chiefs, freemen and slaves who passed  their lives hunting and fighting other tribes. The sole property of the  Chiefs and freemen were their huts, canoes, and slaves, and the rude  instruments they used in war and hunting. The unfortunate slaves were  bought and sold, captured in war and were often killed and eaten. One  slave was worth so many goats, lances, or knives, and one large canoe  would buy several women. Legislation rested with the Chiefs and trial by  ordeal was common, but always so arranged that the result could be  controlled by the judge. This is not the place however, to describe  these interesting, if horrible practices.    Now at present the people are rich beyond the wildest dreams of their  ancestors for the value of the property of the great Chiefs has greatly  increased, since"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#19)"],[1,"ing-apartment with his fellow-captives, he preserved the ladies'  reputation and his own trustworthiness by standing all night at the  door of the room with a lighted lantern in his hand.    Into details of the various exploits of the three Brothers of the  Peach-orchard we need not enter here. They are written in full in the  book of the _Story of the Three Kingdoms_, a romance in which every  Chinese who can read takes keen delight. Kuan Yue remained faithful to  his oath, even though tempted with a marquisate by the great Ts'ao  Ts'ao, but he was at length captured by Sun Ch'uean and put to death  (A.D. 219). Long celebrated as the most renowned of China's military  heroes, he was ennobled in A.D. 1120 as Faithful and Loyal Duke. Eight  years later he had conferred on him by letters patent the still more  glorious title of Magnificent Prince and Pacificator. The Emperor Wen  (A.D. 1330-3) of the Yuean dynasty added the appellation Warrior Prince  and Civilizer, and, finally, the Emperor Wan Li of the Ming dynasty,  in 1594, conferred on him the title of Faithful and Loyal Great _Ti_,  Supporter of Heaven and Protector of the Kingdom. He thus became a god,  a _ti_, and has ever since received worship as Kuan Ti or Wu Ti, the  God of War. Temples (1600 State temples and thousands of smaller ones)  erected in his honour are to be seen in all parts of the country. He  is one of the most popular gods of China. During the last half-century  of the Manchu Period his fame greatly increased. In 1856 he is said  to have appeared in the heavens and successfully turned the tide of  battle in favour of the Imperialists. His portrait hangs in every tent,  but his worship is not confined to the officials and the army, for  many trades and professions have elected him as a patron saint. The  sword of the public executioner used to be kept within the precincts  of his temple, and after an execution the presiding magistrate would  stop there to worship for fear the ghost of the criminal might follow  him home. He knew that the spirit would not dare to enter Kuan Ti's  presence.    Thus the Chinese have no fewer than three gods of literature--perhaps  not too many for so literary a people. A fourth, a Taoist god, will  be mentioned later.      Buddhism in China    Buddhism and its mythology have formed an important part of Chinese  thought for nearly two thousand years. The religion was brought  to China about A.D. 65, ready-made in its Mahayanistic form, in  consequence of a dream of the Emperor Ming Ti (A.D. 58-76) of the  Eastern Han dynasty in or about the year 63; though some knowledge  of Buddha and his doctrines existed as early as 217 B.C. As Buddha,  the chief deity of Buddhism, was a man and became a god, the religion  originated, like the others, in ancestor-worship. When a man dies, says  this religion, his other self reappears in one form or another, \"from a  clod to a divinity.\" The way for Buddhism in China was paved by Taoism,  and Buddhism reciprocally affected Taoism by helpful development of  its doctrines of sanctity and immortalization. Buddhism also, as it has  been well put by Dr De Groot, [17] \"contributed much to the ceremonial  adornment of ancestor-worship. Its salvation work on behalf of the  dead saved its place in Confucian China; for of Confucianism itself,  piety and devotion towards parents and ancestors, and the promotion of  their happiness, were the core, and, consequently, their worship with  sacrifices and ceremonies was always a sacred duty.\" It was thus that  it was possible for the gods of Buddhism to be introduced into China  and to maintain their special characters and fulfil their special  functions without being absorbed into or submerged by the existing  native religions. The result was, as we have seen, in the end a  partnership rather than a relation of master and servant; and I say  'in the end' because, contrary to popular belief, the Chinese have  not been tolerant of foreign religious faiths, and at various times  have persecuted Buddhism as relentlessly as they have other rivals  to orthodox Confucianism.      Buddha, the Law, and the Priesthood    At the head of the Buddhist gods in China we find the triad  known as Buddha, the Law, and the Church, or Priesthood, which are  personified as Shih-chia Fo (Shakya), O-mi-t'o Fo (Amita), and Ju-lai  Fo (Tathagata); otherwise Fo Pao, Fa Pao, and Seng Pao (the _San Pao_,  'Three Precious Ones')--that is, Buddha, the prophet who came into the  world to teach the Law, Dharma, the Law Everlasting, and Samgha, its  mystical body, Priesthood, or Church. Dharma is an entity underived,  containing the spiritual elements and material constituents of the  universe. From it the other two evolve: Buddha (Shakyamuni), the  creative energy, Samgha, the totality of existence and of life. To the  people these are three personal Buddhas, whom they worship without  concerning themselves about their origin. To the priests they are  simply the Buddha, past, present, or future. There are also several  other of these groups or triads, ten or more, composed of different  deities, or sometimes containing one or two of the triad already  named. Shakyamuni heads the list, having a place in at least six.    The legend of the Buddha belongs rather to Indian than to Chinese  mythology, and is too long to be reproduced here. [18]    The principal gods of Buddhism are Jan-teng Fo, the Light-lamp  Buddha, Mi-lo Fo (Maitreya), the expected Messiah of the Buddhists,  O-mi-t'o Fo (Amitabha or Amita), the guide who conducts his devotees  to the Western Paradise, Yueeh-shih Fo, the Master-physician Buddha,  Ta-shih-chih P'u-sa (Mahastama), companion of Amitabha, P'i-lu Fo  (Vairotchana), the highest of the Threefold Embodiments, Kuan Yin,  the Goddess of Mercy, Ti-tsang Wang, the God of Hades, Wei-t'o  (Viharapala), the Deva protector of the Law of Buddha and Buddhist  temples, the Four Diamond Kings of Heaven, and Bodhidharma, the first  of the six Patriarchs of Eastern or Chinese Buddhism.      Diamond Kings of Heaven    On the right and left sides of the entrance hall of Buddhist temples,  two on each side, are the gigantic figures of the four great _Ssu Ta  Chin-kang_ or _T'ien-wang_, the Diamond Kings of Heaven, protectors  or governors of the continents lying in the direction of the four  cardinal points from Mount Sumeru, the centre of the world. They are  four brothers named respectively Mo-li Ch'ing (Pure), or Tseng Chang,  Mo-li Hung (Vast), or Kuang Mu, Mo-li Hai (Sea), or To Wen, and Mo-li  Shou (Age), or Ch'ih Kuo. The _Chin kuang ming_ states that they bestow  all kinds of happiness on those who honour the Three Treasures, Buddha,  the Law, and the Priesthood. Kings and nations who neglect the Law  lose their protection. They are described and represented as follows:    Mo-li Ch'ing, the eldest, is twenty-four feet in height, with a beard  the hairs of which are like copper wire. He carries a magnificent  jade ring and a spear, and always fights on foot. He has also a magic  sword, 'Blue Cloud,' on the blade of which are engraved the characters  _Ti, Shui, Huo, Feng_ (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind). When brandished,  it causes a black wind, which produces tens of thousands of spears,  which pierce the bodies of men and turn them to dust. The wind is  followed by a fire, which fills the air with tens of thousands of  golden fiery serpents. A thick smoke also rises out of the ground,  which blinds and burns men, none being able to escape.    Mo-li Hung carries in his hand an umbrella, called the Umbrella of  Chaos, formed of pearls possessed of spiritual properties. Opening  this marvellous implement causes the heavens and earth to be covered  with thick darkness, and turning it upside down produces violent  storms of wind and thunder and universal earthquakes.    Mo-li Hai holds a four-stringed guitar, the twanging of which  supernaturally affects the earth, water, fire, or wind. When it is  played all the world listens, and the camps of the enemy take fire.    Mo-li Shou has two whips and a panther-skin bag, the home of a creature  resembling a white rat, known as Hua-hu Tiao. When at large this  creature assumes the form of a white winged elephant, which devours  men. He sometimes has also a snake or other man-eating creature,  always ready to obey his behests.        Legend of the Diamond Kings    The legend of the Four Diamond Kings given in the _Feng shen yen i_  is as follows: At the time of the consolidation of the Chou dynasty  in the twelfth and eleventh centuries B.C., Chiang Tzu-ya, chief  counsellor to Wen Wang, and General Huang Fei-hu were defending  the town and mountain of Hsi-ch'i. The supporters of the house of  Shang appealed to the four genii Mo, who lived at Chia-meng Kuan,  praying them to come to their aid. They agreed, raised an army  of 100,000 celestial soldiers, and traversing towns, fields, and  mountains arrived in less than a day at the north gate of Hsi-ch'i,  where Mo-li Ch'ing pitched his camp and entrenched his soldiers.    Hearing of this, Huang Fei-hu hastened to warn Chiang Tzu-ya of the  danger which threatened him. \"The four great generals who have just  arrived at the north gate,\" he said, \"are marvellously powerful genii,  experts in all the mysteries of magic and use of wonderful charms. It  is much to be feared that we shall not be able to resist them.\"    Many fierce battles ensued. At first these went in favour of the  _Chin-kang_, thanks to their magical weapons and especially to Mo-li  Shou's Hua-hu Tiao, who terrorized the enemy by devouring their  bravest warriors.      Hua-hu Tiao devours Yang Chien    Unfortunately for the _Chin-kang_, the brute attacked and swallowed  Yang Chien, the nephew of Yue Huang. This genie, on entering the body  of the monster, rent his heart asunder and cut him in two. As he could  transform himself at will, he assumed the shape of Hua-hu Tiao, and  went off to Mo-li Shou, who"]]]
