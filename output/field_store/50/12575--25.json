[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#19)"],[1," of filing office records, as  explained apparently by the man who devised it, is well set forth in the  following combination of the personal experience and the  \"how-to-do-something\" types of articles. It appeared in _System_ with a  half-tone reproduction of a photograph showing a man looking over  records in a drawer of the desk at which he is seated.        WHO'LL DO JOHN'S WORK?        BY M. C. HOBART        \"It's a quarter after 8 and Schuyler hasn't showed up,\" telephoned      Beggs, one of our foremen, last Tuesday morning. \"I've put Fanning      on his machine, but that won't help much unless I can get somebody      to work at Fanning's bench. Got anybody you can let me have for      to-day?\"        I didn't know offhand. But I told Beggs I'd call him back.        Ten minutes later a young lathe operator reported to Beggs. He was      able to run Fanning's machine while the latter temporarily filled      the shoes of the absent Schuyler.        Scarcely a week passes that does not bring a similar call to our      employment office. While our plant, as plants go, is not large, we      always have a number of men working with us who are fitted by      experience and adaptability to do other work than that which they      are hired to do. Such men are invaluable to know about, especially      when an operator stays away for a day or perhaps a week and the shop      is full of orders. Once it was a problem to find the right man      immediately. A few additions to our employment records made it      possible to keep track of each man's complete qualifications.        The employment records I keep in my desk in the deep drawer. They      are filed alphabetically by name. When we hire a man we write his      name and the job he is to fill on the outside of a 9 by 12 manila      envelope. Into this envelope we put his application, his references,      and other papers. His application tells us what kinds of work he can      do and has done in other shops.        There are 29 different kinds of work to be done in our shops, from      gear cutting to running errands. I have listed these operations,      alphabetically, on a cardboard the exact length of the employment      record envelope, 12 inches. When a man tells me in his application      that he not only can operate a drill press, for which he is hired,      but has also worked at grinding, I fit my cardboard list to the top      of the employment record envelope and punch two notches along the      top directly opposite the words \"drill press\" and \"grinding\" on my      list. Then I file away the envelope.        I rest secure now in my knowledge that I have not buried a potential      grinder in a drill press operator, or that I do not have to carry      his double qualifications in my mind. I know that if Beggs should      suddenly telephone me some morning that his grinder is absent--sick,      or fishing, perhaps--I need only take my cardboard list and,      starting at A, run it down my file until I come to the envelope of      the drill press operator. I am stopped there automatically by the      second notch on the envelope which corresponds in position to the      word \"grinder\" on my list.        And there is every likelihood that, with the necessary explanation      to the man's own foreman, Beggs will get his grinder for the day.    From the following article, printed in _Farm and Fireside_ city and  country readers alike may glean much practical information concerning  ways and means of making a comfortable living from a small farm. It was  illustrated by four half-tone reproductions of photographs showing (1)  the house, (2) the woman at her desk with a typewriter before her, (3)  the woman in her dining-room about to serve a meal from a labor-saving  service wagon, and (4) the woman in the poultry yard with a basket of  eggs.        TEN ACRES AND A LIVING        SHE WAS YOUNG, POPULAR, AND HAD BEEN REARED IN THE CITY. EVERYBODY      LAUGHED WHEN SHE DECIDED TO FARM--BUT THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO        BY ALICE MARY KIMBALL        When she decided to be a farmer everybody laughed. She was young,      popular, unusually fond of frocks and fun. She had been reared in      the city. She didn't know a Jersey from a Hereford, or a Wyandotte      from a Plymouth Rock.        \"You'll be back in six months,\" her friends said.        Four years have passed. Mrs. Charles S. Tupper still is \"buried\" in      the country. Moreover, she is supplying eggs, chickens, honey, and      home-canned goods to those of her former associates who are willing      to pay for quality.        \"Farming,\" said Mrs. Tupper, \"is the ideal vocation for the woman      who feels the modern desire for a job and the need of marriage and a      home.        \"I never wanted a job so keenly as when I found myself in a small      city apartment without enough to do to keep me busy. After I'd swept      and dusted and prepared meals for two, I had hours of time on my      hands. The corner bakeshop, the laundry, and modern conveniences had      thrust upon me more leisure than I could use. Mr. Tupper is a young      engineer whose work takes him to various parts of the Southwest. In      his absence I felt strongly the need of filling up my idle hours in      some interesting, useful way.        \"I didn't quite like the idea of spending all my spare time on      cards, calling, women's clubs, and social pleasures. I longed to be      a real partner to my husband and to share in making the family      income as well as spending it.        \"We had a few thousand saved for a home, and were trying to decide      where to build. One day it flashed upon me: 'Why invest in city      property? Why not a little farm? Then we'll have a home; I'll have a      job, and can make our living.'\"        The idea materialized into a modern bungalow on a 10-acre farm in      Westdale, Missouri, an hour's drive from Kansas City. Mr. Tupper's      salary furnished working capital for the enterprise and Mrs. Tupper      has found congenial work as farmer-in-chief.        Poultry, bees, and a vegetable garden are Mrs. Tupper's      specialities. Her side lines are a pig and a registered Jersey cow.      She looks after the poultry, works in garden and apiary, and milks      the cow herself. She employs very little help.        \"It wasn't difficult to get a start in learning to farm,\" Mrs.      Tupper explained. \"I visited farms and studied the methods of      farmers and their wives. I asked lots of questions.        \"I didn't have any old fogyisms to unlearn, and I didn't acquire      any. I went straight to the agricultural college and the state      poultry experiment station for instructions. While I was living in      the country supervising the building of the bungalow, I read and      digested every bulletin I could get. I'm still studying bulletins. I      subscribe for several farm papers and a bee journal.        \"Of course, I learned a great deal from the practical experience of      the people about me, but I checked up everything to the rules and      directions of government and state agricultural experts, which may      be had for the price of a postage stamp. I tried to take orders      intelligently. I ignored old rules for poultry and bee-keeping.\"        Mrs. Tupper's chickens are hatched in incubators, hovered in a      coal-heated brooder house, fed according to experiment-station      directions, and reared in poultry houses built from      experiment-station designs. From the first they have been      practically free from lice and disease. She gets winter eggs. Even      in zero weather and at times when feed is most costly, her spring      pullets more than pay their way.        \"Bees responded as readily to proper treatment,\" she said. \"My      second season I harvested $265 worth of comb honey from twenty      working swarms. And I was stung not a half-dozen times at that.\"        Some of Mrs. Tupper's neighbors were inclined to joke at first at      her appetite for bulletins, her belief in experts, and her rigid      insistence on pure-bred stock and poultry. They admit now that her      faith has been justified.        If Mrs. Tupper had trod in the well-worn neighborhood ruts, she      would have marketed her produce by the      country-store-commission-man-retailer-consumer route; but again she      did not. From the first she planned to plug the leakage of farm      profits in middlemen's commissions. When she had anything to sell,      she put on a good-looking tailored suit, a becoming hat, smart shoes      and gloves, and went to the city to talk to ultimate consumers.        The consciousness of being dressed appropriately--not expensively or      ornately--is a valuable aid to the farm saleswoman, Mrs. Tupper      thinks.        \"If a salesman comes to me shabbily dressed or flashily dressed, I      can't give him a fair hearing,\" she said. \"I may let him talk on,      but I decide against him the instant I look at him. So I reasoned      that a trim, pleasing appearance would be as valuable an asset to me      as to the men who sell pickles, insurance, or gilt-edged bonds. It      would mean a favorable first impression and open the way to show      samples and make a sales talk.        \"If I tried to interview a prospective customer handicapped by the      consciousness that my skirt hung badly or that my shoes were shabby,      not only would I be timid and ill at ease, but my appearance would      suggest to the city buyer the very slipshodness and lack of      reliability he fears in buying direct from the farm.        \"I go strong on attractive samples. It would be useless to try for      fancy prices if I brought honey to town in mean-looking cases or      rusty cans. A slight drip down the side of a package might not be      proof positive of poor quality, but it would frighten away a careful      buyer.

He picked up the full-length mirror as  though it had been a small picture, and stood for an instant grinning  cheerfully, looking round the room in which his mistress had so often  kicked and threatened him.    Then he gave a little click at the back of his throat, placed the  mirror on the floor and stole across the Persian carpet of an unknown  antiquity and value to a painted deal writing desk which had once  reposed in a shop window in Westbourne Grove; and which, on account of  its little drawers and little cupboards with painted doors, had given  intense joy to the woman whose wealth in hard cash in the bank and  jewels in the safe was almost incredible.  He lifted the slanting lid,  moved a bundle of papers fastened by an elastic band, and pulled out a  drawer out of which be took a cheque-book.    He had no idea of the real use of the book with the buff cover and pale  pink leaves, but he knew that you had only to make certain black marks  on one of the pink leaves and take it to the big house in the Sharia  Clot Bey with its fierce man standing in front of the door and money  would be given in exchange.    On account of his cunning, his stolidity, his mighty muscle and  ferocious appearance Qatim had been made bank-messenger in chief to the  House of Zulannah, and had often stood at his mistress's side when she  had taken the cheque-book from the drawer and made strange black marks  on one of the pink leaves.  True, he had rolled his eyes and shown his  teeth fiercely many a time at the interpreter who had had to be called  to explain that, although he had handed a pink leaf through the bars,  there was no money forthcoming; but as his mistress had not struck him  for returning empty-handed he had resigned himself at last to the  strangeness of the proceedings.  The book meant money, that was all he  knew; so he slipped it into his loin-cloth as had been his rather  distressing habit when handed a bundle of notes by the bank-clerk who,  with his co-workers, had never tired of gazing at the gigantic creature  in white shorts, crimson tunic, huge turban and rattling scimitar.    He gave no thought to the dead body on the filthy straw; that he knew  he could carry under his arm and drop into the Nile when the bazaar  slept; but he pulled hard at his curly hair as a plan germinated in the  sluggish convolutions of his brain.    It was a very vague and a very childlike plan, but too much could not  be expected from one who had been conceived, born and bred on the  animal plane.    After an hour's pondering it, however, took a fairly definite outline.    When the sun had warmed the cool wind of night he would hide the body  under the straw and visit his eunuch twin, who had really been the  cause of the disaster.  His silence would have to be bought.  Of course  it would have been better to have broken his neck at once, but it was  too late now, so there was no use in worrying!  Then he would go  terrorise the servants, giving them to understand that he had been left  in charge in his mistress's absence; he would remain in charge until he  had acquired enough money to buy the coal-black little Venus who worked  in the Shoemakers Bazaar; after that he would creep away with her and  return to his own village further down the Nile.    And because, perhaps, of the childishness of the plan it succeeded up  to a certain point.    He found his eunuch brother, who was the only one besides his master  and himself to know that the dancer had been Zulannah, in the grip of  such terror and physical pain as to be almost imbecile, though a look  of cunning had shone for a moment in his bloodshot eyes when Qatim had  inadvertently let drop a hint as to the accumulated riches in his hovel.    Anyway, they came to an understanding which ensured the eunuch's  silence at the price of so much good money, paid in instalments.    Qatim had no intention of holding to his side of the agreement, nor his  brother to his--as is the way of such breed of Oriental.    Then, just as he was, clad only in loin-cloth and with whip in hand,  the gigantic brute strode to the House of Zulannah.  Ensued a turbulent  hour, at the end of which he remained acknowledged master of the house  and inmates until the return of the mistress, whilst those who had  mocked him went in search of cool leaves to place upon the bruised  portion of their backs and those two whose heads he had cracked  together for having resisted him lay quite still.    Returned to the hovel as the sun was sinking, and in high fettle, he  donned red tunic, huge turban and rattling scimitar and strutted with  all the negro's delight in fine feathers in front of the mirror which  rested against the crumbling plaster walls.    And then he suddenly stopped and stared into the glass.    The filthy straw in the corner of the room had moved.  His face went  grey; great beads of sweat showed upon his chest, his knees shook, then  he fell on his face and covered his head with a corner of the  green-yellow Kidderminster carpet, when a voice feebly craved for water  and a small blood-stained hand weakly pulled at the straw.    Zulannah was not dead.    He lay terror-stricken for some long time, then slowly got to his  knees, tore off the fine feathers and flung the scimitar into a far  corner; then, naked save for the loin-cloth, sat down with his back to  the straw and pulled at his curly oiled hair, a sure sign in him of  deep thought.    Then he grinned and, rising, walked across the floor, and, sitting down  again, pulled the woman from under the straw.    No!  Zulannah was not dead, nor even fatally hurt, but she was horrible  to look upon when the Ethiopian had washed her clean by means of a  handful of straw dipped in a broken pitcher of water.    The dog's great fangs had driven behind the ear, severing the mastoid  nerve so that the mouth was pulled right up the left side of the face;  it had also injured the muscle controlling the eyelid, causing it to  droop and giving a diabolical leer to the once beautiful doe-like eye;  it had also injured the muscle of the neck so that the head was  slightly twisted; but, worst of all, the other dog had driven its  terrible fangs into the muscle above the knees, injuring it so that she  would never walk straight again.    And Qatim sat back on his haunches, and laughed, clapping his enormous  hands.    She was not dead, and her hands were not injured, but she was too  hideous to show herself unveiled and too twisted to be recognised in  the street.    So all that was left to him to do was to cure her injuries--which he  did, and quickly, under the advice of an old herbalist in the Silk  Market,--and then sit down for the rest of his life whilst she drew  strange little marks on those pale pink leaves.          CHAPTER XVI      \"_My faint spirit was sitting in the light    Of thy looks, my love;    It panted for thee like the hind at noon    For the brooks, my love_.\"              SHELLEY.      For some inexplicable reason, the little old lady's trust in Jill's son  was unshakable.  Why, she could not have well explained.  It might have  been because of his ability to hide his hurt or the memory of his words  spoken as the fortune-teller on the night of the ball, or perhaps  through his self-denial in refraining from using his mother's erstwhile  friendship with the old aristocrat, as a key to the door which was  locked fast between himself and the girl he loved.    After all, such marriages _had_ taken place, thousands of them, so why  should not his with the beautiful girl be added to the list, the  outcome thereof proving the proverbial exception to the inevitable  disastrous ending of all such unions?    Why did he deny himself?    Just because he loved the girl with the same all-sacrificing love his  white mother had given his Arabian father.    If it had been otherwise, with never a second thought he would have  lifted the girl, as doubtlessly his ancestors had oft-times lifted  women in their _gazus_ or raids, and left the consequences in the hands  of that old beldame Fate.    So it had been decided to start the day after the morrow by private and  swiftest steam-boat to Luxor, where Damaris, shepherded by Jane Coop  and under the social wing of Lady Thistleton, would sojourn at the  Winter Palace Hotel until such time as her godmother should see fit to  return from her errand of mercy to the House 'an Mahabbha in the Oasis  of Khargegh.    Thus, whilst Jane Coop slept placidly and Maria Hobson wrestled under  the bed-covering in the last throes of a nightmare in which, as a  camel, she packed parcels of sand wrapped in tissue-paper, in trunks  which stretched across an endless desert, Damaris drove out to the  Obelisk for her last ride on the stallion Sooltan.    She rode out into the shadows, the dawn having barely lifted the hem of  night's purple raiment from the edge of the world; out into the desert  stretching silver-grey, soundless, half-waking; just stirred by the  light touch of the breeze, which, heralding the dawn, sends little  spirals of sand dancing away to the east and away to the west and blows  out the stars one by one.    And she rode listlessly, knowing that no desert would ever be as this  desert, or dawn as this passing of the night, or liberty as this hour  of freedom in the wastes of sand.    And then, when perhaps ten, perhaps more or less, miles out, she pulled  the stallion sharply and sat forward, staring, whilst her heart  thrilled in a most unwarrantable manner beneath her coat.    Upon a hummock of sand, with tattered robes of saffron, purple and of  gold about his feet, there sat a youth.    Sideways he sat, with tips of slender feet to ground as though  preparatory to flight.  One fine brown hand pushed back a misty veil  before the face, which shone wanly in the half-light.  "]]]
