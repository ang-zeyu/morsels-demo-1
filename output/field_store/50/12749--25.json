The imaginary sharp-shooter was an expert, and he was trying  to hit the same spot with each shot. The deviation from the center is  bound to be the same on all sides.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--The \"Chance\" or \"Probability\" Form of  Distribution.]    Now suppose a series of measurements of a thousand children be taken in,  let us say, the ability to do 18 problems in subtraction in 10 minutes.  A few of them finish only one problem in that time; a few more do two,  more still are able to complete three, and so on up. The great bulk of  the children get through from 8 to 12 problems in the allotted time; a  few finish the whole task. Now if we make a column for all those who did  one problem, another column beside it for all those who did two, and so  on up for those who did three, four and on to eighteen, a line drawn  over the tops of the columns make a curve like the above from  Thorndike.    Comparing this curve with the one formed by the marksman's spent  bullets, one can not help being struck by the similarity. If the first  represented a distribution governed purely by chance, it is evident that  the children's ability seems to be distributed in accordance with a  similar law.    With the limited number of categories used in this example, it would not  be possible to get a smooth curve, but only a kind of step pyramid. With  an increase in the number of categories, the steps become smaller. With  a hundred problems to work out, instead of 18, the curve would be  something like this:    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Probability curve with increased  number of steps.]    And with an infinite number, the steps would disappear altogether,  leaving a perfectly smooth, flowing line, unmarred by a single step or  break. It would be an absolutely _continuous_ distribution.    If then, the results of all the tests that have been made on all mental  traits be studied, it will be found that human mental ability as shown  in at least 95% of all the traits that have been measured, is  distributed throughout the race in various degrees, in accordance with  the law of chance, and that if one could measure all the members of the  species and plot a curve for these measurements, in any trait, he would  get this smooth, continuous curve. In other words, human beings are not  sharply divided into classes, but the differences between them shade off  into each other, although between the best and the worst, in any  respect, there is a great gulf.    If this statement applies to simple traits, such as memory for numbers,  it must also apply to combinations of simple traits in complex mental  processes. For practical purposes, we are therefore justified in saying  that in respect of any mental quality,--ability, industry, efficiency,  persistence, attentiveness, neatness, honesty, anything you like,--in  any large group of people, such as the white inhabitants of the United  States, some individuals will be found who show the character in  question in a very low degree, some who show it in a very high degree;  and there will be found every possible degree in between.    [Illustration: NORMAL VARIABILITY CURVE FOLLOWING LAW OF CHANCE    FIG. 13.--The above photograph (from A. F. Blakeslee), shows  beans rolling down an inclined plane and accumulating in compartments at  the base which are closed in front by glass. The exposure was long  enough to cause the moving beans to appear as caterpillar-like objects  hopping along the board. Assuming that the irregularity of shape of the  beans is such that each may make jumps toward the right or toward the  left, in rolling down the board, the laws of chance lead to the  expectation that in very few cases will these jumps all be in the same  direction, as is demonstrated by the few beans collected in the  compartments at the extreme right and left. Rather the beans will tend  to jump in both right and left directions, the most probable condition  being that in which the beans make an equal number of jumps to the right  and left, as is shown by the large number accumulated in the central  compartment. If the board be tilted to one side, the curve of beans  would be altered by this one-sided influence. In like fashion a series  of factors--either of environment or of heredity--if acting equally in  both favorable and unfavorable directions, will cause a group of men to  form a similar variability curve, when classified according to their  relative height.]    The consequences of this for race progress are significant. Is it  desired to eliminate feeble-mindedness? Then it must be borne in mind  that there is no sharp distinction between feeble-mindedness and the  normal mind. One can not divide sheep from goats, saying \"A is  feeble-minded. B is normal. C is feeble-minded. D is normal,\" and so on.  If one took a scale of a hundred numbers, letting 1 stand for an idiot  and 100 for a genius, one would find individuals corresponding to every  single number on the scale. The only course possible would be a somewhat  arbitrary one; say to consider every individual corresponding to a grade  under seven as feeble-minded. It would have to be recognized that those  graded eight were not much better than those graded seven, but the  drawing of the line at seven would be justified on the ground that it  had to be drawn somewhere, and seven seemed to be the most satisfactory  point.    In practice of course, students of retardation test children by  standardized scales. Testing a hundred 10-year-old children, the  examiner might find a number who were able to do only those tests which  are passed by a normal six-year-old child. He might properly decide to  put all who thus showed four years of retardation, in the class of  feeble-minded; and he might justifiably decide that those who tested  seven years (i.e., three years mental retardation) or less would, for  the present, be given the benefit of the doubt, and classed among the  possibly normal. Such a procedure, in dealing with intelligence, is  necessary and justifiable, but its adoption must not blind students, as  it often does, to the fact that the distinction made is an arbitrary  one, and that there is no more a hard and fast line of demarcation  between imbeciles and normals than there is between \"rich men\" and \"poor  men.\"    [Illustration: CADETS ARRANGED TO SHOW NORMAL CURVE OF VARIABILITY    FIG. 14.--The above company of students at Connecticut  Agricultural College was grouped according to height and photographed by  A. F. Blakeslee. The height of each rank, and the number of men of that  height, is shown by the figures underneath the photograph. The company  constitutes what is technically known as a \"population\" grouped in  \"arrays of variates\"; the middle rank gives the median height of the  population; the tallest array (5 ft., 8 in.) is the mode. If a line be  drawn connecting the upper ends of the rows, the resulting geometric  figure will be a \"scheme of distribution of variates\" or more briefly a  \"variability curve,\" such as was shown in several preceding figures. The  arrangement of homogeneous objects of any kind in such form as this is  the first step in the study of variation by modern statistical methods,  and on such study much of the progress of genetics depends.]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Height is one of the stock examples of  a continuous character--one of which all grades can be found. As will be  seen from the above diagram, every height from considerably under five  feet to considerably over six feet can be found in the army, but extreme  deviations are relatively rare in proportion to the amount of deviation.  The vertical columns represent the total number of individuals of a  given height in inches. From Davenport.]    If a group of soldiers be measured as the children were measured for  arithmetical ability, their height will be distributed in this same  curve of probability. Fig. 14 shows the cadets of Connecticut  Agricultural College; it is obvious that a line drawn along the tops  of the files would again make the step-pyramid shown in Figures 10, 11  and 13. If a larger number were taken, the steps would disappear and  give place to a smooth curve; the fact is well shown in a graph for the  heights of recruits to the American Army (Fig. 15).    The investigation in this direction need not be pursued any farther. For  the purpose of eugenics, it is sufficient to recognize that great  differences exist between men, and women, not only in respect of  physical traits, but equally in respect of mental ability.    This conclusion might easily have been reached from a study of the facts  in Chapter I, but it seemed worth while to take time to present the fact  in a more concrete form as the result of actual measurements. The  evidence allows no doubt about the existence of considerable mental and  physical differences between men.    The question naturally arises, \"What is the cause of these differences?\"    The study of twins showed that the differences could not be due to  differences in training or home surroundings. If the reader will think  back over the facts set forth in the first chapter, he will see clearly  that the fundamental differences in men can not be due to anything that  happens after they are born; and the facts presented in the second  chapter showed that these differences can not be due in an important  degree to any influences acting on the child prior to birth.          CHAPTER IV    THE INHERITANCE OF MENTAL CAPACITIES      We have come to the climax of the eugenist's preliminary argument; if  the main differences between human beings are not due to anything in the  environment or training, either of this or previous generations, there  can be but one explanation for them.    They must be due to the ancestry of the individual--that is, they must  be matters of heredity in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#19)"],[1,"it;  profound darkness covered the beautiful world, and dreadful shrieks and  groans resounded through the air. But from the midst of the black clouds  a bright, dazzling star burst like a rocket, and set fire to every  thing, until all countries were in ruins, and all cities burned down.  And as I saw that, I cried in my anguish, \"Fire! fire!\" Fortunately, you  came and awakened me.' That, sire,\" said the castellan, drawing a deep  breath, \"that was the dream. The king went on to say: 'The dream, I am  sure, is a portentous one, and some remarkable event will doubtless  happen in the course of this night. Write down every thing I told you,  and remember the date and year!' I did as his majesty ordered me; I  wrote down the date, the year, and even the hour in which the dream  occurred.\"    \"Was the dream really a portentous one? Did any remarkable event occur  in that night?\"    \"Yes, sire, a very remarkable event occurred in that night, but his  majesty did not hear of it; he died too early.\"    \"When did he have that dream?\" asked Napoleon, fixing his eyes on the  old man, who composedly bore the searching gaze.    A pause ensued. The castellan replied: \"Sire, Frederick the Great had  that dream on the 15th of August, 1769.\"    \"On my birthday!\" ejaculated Napoleon.    \"On the 15th of August, 1769,\" repeated the old man, \"at three o'clock  in the morning.\"    \"The hour of my birth,\" muttered the emperor to himself. After a short  pause he turned again toward the castellan, and a strange, sarcastic  smile played on his lips.    \"The star fell from the sky, and set fire to all the palaces and  countries?\" he asked.    The castellan nodded.    \"And you believed that the dream referred to me, and that I am the  fallen star?\"    \"Sire, I only related what the king had dreamed, and in what night and  in what hour he had the remarkable dream. His majesty spoke frequently  about it, and all his friends heard of it. But nobody was able to  interpret it. He died without obtaining the solution.\"    \"But you have solved it,\" said Napoleon, sneeringly. \"I am the fallen  star, and you think I have come to fulfil that dream?\"    \"Sire, I--\"    \"I shall burn down your palaces and scourge your country,\" added he,  harshly. \"Why did you irritate me? I did not commence the war; since you  desired it, I gave it to you. But tell your friends and the good  citizens of Potsdam that the dream of their king will not be entirely  fulfilled. It may be that I shall be compelled to destroy royal palaces,  but the house of the citizen and the cabin of the peasant will not feel  my wrath, nor will I lay waste your fields. Tell the good denizens of  this city--tell them not to be afraid of me; for never shall I assail  their rights and privileges, nor interfere with their interests. And  now, gentlemen, let us proceed!\" He quickly crossed the room, and  entered the adjoining apartment.    \"Sire, this is the reception-room of Frederick the Great,\" said the  castellan, who had followed. \"On that table lies the full suit in which  his majesty gave his last audience--his uniform, his order of the Black  Eagle, his hat and sword.\"    Napoleon hastened to the table, and seized the sword. \"Ah, the sword of  Frederick II.,\" he exclaimed, with sparkling eyes. \"He often wielded it  with a victorious hand, and that hat covered a head adorned with the  laurel-wreath of the poet and the great general! These are trophies that  I prefer to all the treasures of Prussia. What a capital present for the  Invalides, especially for those who formed part of the army of Hanover!  They will be delighted, no doubt, when they see in our possession the  sword of him who beat them at Rossbach! And as my dear brother,  Frederick William III., has conferred the order of the Black Eagle on  me, I suppose he will permit me to take this decoration as a souvenir of  the greatest king of the house of Hohenzollern. What about the bell that  is placed beside the hat?\"    \"Sire,\" said the castellan, mournfully and hesitatingly, \"it is the bell  which the king used during his whole reign to call the gentlemen waiting  in the anteroom, and the footmen at night.\"    \"That bell shall stand henceforward in my cabinet and on my desk,\" said  Napoleon. \"Grand marshal, order all these things to be packed up and to  be sent immediately to Paris, and add to them also the clock in the  other room--the clock that was so faithful to the great king as to stop  at his death, and to refuse to mark the time for any one else. I will  wind it up, and the clock of Frederick the Great must strike again for  me. Conduct us to the other rooms, castellan.\"    The old man cast a long and melancholy look on the precious relics that  were about to be taken from him, and took leave of them with a profound  sigh. He then conducted the party to the other rooms. He showed them the  library, where Frederick, during the last years of his life, had spent  every hour when not occupied with government affairs, longing for no  other society than that of his books. He then took them to the rooms in  which Voltaire had lived, and showed the emperor a paper on which the  king had written verses that Voltaire had corrected and revised.  Napoleon contemplated every thing with the greatest attention, and then  caused himself to be conducted to the fine long hall, in which  Frederick, accompanied by his dog, used to take his daily walk when the  weather was too bad for him to do so in the open air. The walls of this  hall were adorned with many paintings and engravings--all, however, did  not apparently belong to the period of Frederick; for there were among  them paintings and engravings representing his last hours, and his  lonely nocturnal funeral.--Others again depicted the scene of young  Frederick William II. standing by the corpse of his great uncle, and  swearing with tearful eyes, his hand placed on the head of Frederick,  that he would be a just and good ruler to his people.    \"And what does this picture represent?\" asked Napoleon, pointing to an  engraving by the side of the above-mentioned painting.    \"Sire,\" said the castellan, in confusion, \"it is a copper-plate,  representing the king's tomb. It does not properly belong here, but has  been placed here temporarily. The artist sent it hither with the request  to place it somewhere in Sans-souci, and I hung it up in this place  until my master disposes of it in some other way.\"    \"But what about this one?\" asked the emperor, whose piercing eyes were  fixed on another engraving. \"There is the tomb of Frederick; two men, in  full uniform, are standing by its side; a beautiful lady is with them,  and all three are raising their hands in an odd manner. Ah, ah, now I  comprehend: that is last year's scene, when the Emperor Alexander took  leave of the king and queen at the grave of Frederick the Great, and  swore eternal friendship to them as well as eternal enmity to France?  That is what this engraving represents, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, sire, it is,\" said the castellan, timidly.    Napoleon, with a flashing glance, called his marshals to his side.  \"Behold there, gentlemen, one of those theatrical scenes with which  people here in Prussia were declaiming against me, while I was silent,  but arming against them,\" said he with a sneer. \"If the King of Prussia  does not fulfil the other oaths he has taken more faithfully than this  one, I pity his people; but he has incurred the retribution of the gods,  who insist on it that men shall fulfil their promises or they will be  crushed. We have seen enough of the place where Frederick the Great  passed his life; let us pay a last visit to him in his tomb. Where is  it?\"    \"In Potsdam, sire, in the church close to the palace.\"    \"Very well. Come, gentlemen. And you, castellan, do not forget that the  dream has not been altogether fulfilled. The 'fallen star' is only a  devouring fire to the kings who bid him defiance, but not to the people  who obediently submit.\" He nodded, stepped from the hall into the  anteroom, and then into the vestibule, where the horses were ready for  him and his suite.    The old man gazed mournfully after the brilliant cavalcade. \"He looks  like a marble statue,\" he muttered, \"and I believe that he has no heart  in his breast. Every thing in him is made of stone. If he had a heart,  he would not dare to come hither and appropriate with a rapacious hand  the sacred relics of our great king. I must really go and see whether  his commands to that effect will be carried out or not.\" And he left the  hall with youthful alacrity, hastening through the apartments back to  the reception-room.    Yes, the commands had been obeyed! The hat and sword, the order of the  Black Eagle, and the bell, had disappeared. The old castellan uttered a  groan, and proceeded to the sitting-room. His anxious eyes glanced at  the spot where the clock had stood. That was also gone. But he heard men  talking and laughing in the anteroom, and when he hastened hither, he  saw some of the emperor's servants, who, in compliance with the orders  of the grand marshal, were engaged in packing up the relics in a basket,  and jesting at what they called the strange and insignificant spoils  which the emperor had obtained here. The white-haired servants of  Frederick the Great were standing close by, and witnessing with tearful  eyes the removal of treasures so sacred on account of the reminiscences  connected with them. The men were just engaged in placing the clock on  the other articles in a basket. The castellan approached hurriedly and  placing his hand on the dial, said in a low voice, \"Farewell! The eyes  of Frederick the Great have often gazed at you. His eyes were also  stars, but not fallen stars, and they did not scorch and burn, but  rendered the people happy. Farewell, faithful clock, that stopped with  grief in the last hour of my king! When _his_ last hour comes, announce  it loudly and joyously, and"]]]
