He made one spring up the bank and caught Peter by the leg, dragged him  down--set him on his feet with a shake--took him by the ear--and said  sternly:--    \"Now, then, what do you mean by it? Don't you know these 'ere waters is  preserved? You ain't no right catching fish 'ere--not to say nothing of  your precious cheek.\"    Peter was always proud afterwards when he remembered that, with the  Bargee's furious fingers tightening on his ear, the Bargee's crimson  countenance close to his own, the Bargee's hot breath on his neck, he  had the courage to speak the truth.    \"I WASN'T catching fish,\" said Peter.    \"That's not YOUR fault, I'll be bound,\" said the man, giving Peter's ear  a twist--not a hard one--but still a twist.    Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis had been holding  on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety. Now suddenly Bobbie  slipped through the railings and rushed down the bank towards Peter, so  impetuously that Phyllis, following more temperately, felt certain that  her sister's descent would end in the waters of the canal. And so it  would have done if the Bargee hadn't let go of Peter's ear--and caught  her in his jerseyed arm.    \"Who are you a-shoving of?\" he said, setting her on her feet.    \"Oh,\" said Bobbie, breathless, \"I'm not shoving anybody. At least, not  on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of course, if it's your  canal, we're sorry and we won't any more. But we didn't know it was  yours.\"    \"Go along with you,\" said the Bargee.    \"Yes, we will; indeed we will,\" said Bobbie, earnestly; \"but we do beg  your pardon--and really we haven't caught a single fish. I'd tell you  directly if we had, honour bright I would.\"    She held out her hands and Phyllis turned out her little empty pocket to  show that really they hadn't any fish concealed about them.    \"Well,\" said the Bargee, more gently, \"cut along, then, and don't you do  it again, that's all.\"    The children hurried up the bank.    \"Chuck us a coat, M'ria,\" shouted the man. And a red-haired woman in a  green plaid shawl came out from the cabin door with a baby in her arms  and threw a coat to him. He put it on, climbed the bank, and slouched  along across the bridge towards the village.    \"You'll find me up at the 'Rose and Crown' when you've got the kid to  sleep,\" he called to her from the bridge.    When he was out of sight the children slowly returned. Peter insisted on  this.    \"The canal may belong to him,\" he said, \"though I don't believe it  does. But the bridge is everybody's. Doctor Forrest told me it's public  property. I'm not going to be bounced off the bridge by him or anyone  else, so I tell you.\"    Peter's ear was still sore and so were his feelings.    The girls followed him as gallant soldiers might follow the leader of a  forlorn hope.    \"I do wish you wouldn't,\" was all they said.    \"Go home if you're afraid,\" said Peter; \"leave me alone. I'M not  afraid.\"    The sound of the man's footsteps died away along the quiet road. The  peace of the evening was not broken by the notes of the sedge-warblers  or by the voice of the woman in the barge, singing her baby to sleep. It  was a sad song she sang. Something about Bill Bailey and how she wanted  him to come home.    The children stood leaning their arms on the parapet of the bridge; they  were glad to be quiet for a few minutes because all three hearts were  beating much more quickly.    \"I'm not going to be driven away by any old bargeman, I'm not,\" said  Peter, thickly.    \"Of course not,\" Phyllis said soothingly; \"you didn't give in to him! So  now we might go home, don't you think?\"    \"NO,\" said Peter.    Nothing more was said till the woman got off the barge, climbed the  bank, and came across the bridge.    She hesitated, looking at the three backs of the children, then she  said, \"Ahem.\"    Peter stayed as he was, but the girls looked round.    \"You mustn't take no notice of my Bill,\" said the woman; \"'is bark's  worse'n 'is bite. Some of the kids down Farley way is fair terrors. It  was them put 'is back up calling out about who ate the puppy-pie under  Marlow bridge.\"    \"Who DID?\" asked Phyllis.    \"_I_ dunno,\" said the woman. \"Nobody don't know! But somehow, and I  don't know the why nor the wherefore of it, them words is p'ison to a  barge-master. Don't you take no notice. 'E won't be back for two hours  good. You might catch a power o' fish afore that. The light's good an'  all,\" she added.    \"Thank you,\" said Bobbie. \"You're very kind. Where's your baby?\"    \"Asleep in the cabin,\" said the woman. \"'E's all right. Never wakes  afore twelve. Reg'lar as a church clock, 'e is.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said Bobbie; \"I would have liked to see him, close to.\"    \"And a finer you never did see, Miss, though I says it.\" The woman's  face brightened as she spoke.    \"Aren't you afraid to leave it?\" said Peter.    \"Lor' love you, no,\" said the woman; \"who'd hurt a little thing like  'im? Besides, Spot's there. So long!\"    The woman went away.    \"Shall we go home?\" said Phyllis.    \"You can. I'm going to fish,\" said Peter briefly.    \"I thought we came up here to talk about Perks's birthday,\" said  Phyllis.    \"Perks's birthday'll keep.\"    So they got down on the towing-path again and Peter fished. He did not  catch anything.    It was almost quite dark, the girls were getting tired, and as Bobbie  said, it was past bedtime, when suddenly Phyllis cried, \"What's that?\"    And she pointed to the canal boat. Smoke was coming from the chimney of  the cabin, had indeed been curling softly into the soft evening air all  the time--but now other wreaths of smoke were rising, and these were  from the cabin door.    \"It's on fire--that's all,\" said Peter, calmly. \"Serve him right.\"    \"Oh--how CAN you?\" cried Phyllis. \"Think of the poor dear dog.\"    \"The BABY!\" screamed Bobbie.    In an instant all three made for the barge.    Her mooring ropes were slack, and the little breeze, hardly strong  enough to be felt, had yet been strong enough to drift her stern against  the bank. Bobbie was first--then came Peter, and it was Peter who  slipped and fell. He went into the canal up to his neck, and his feet  could not feel the bottom, but his arm was on the edge of the barge.  Phyllis caught at his hair. It hurt, but it helped him to get out. Next  minute he had leaped on to the barge, Phyllis following.    \"Not you!\" he shouted to Bobbie; \"ME, because I'm wet.\"    He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door, and flung her aside very  roughly indeed; if they had been playing, such roughness would have made  Bobbie weep with tears of rage and pain. Now, though he flung her on  to the edge of the hold, so that her knee and her elbow were grazed and  bruised, she only cried:--    \"No--not you--ME,\" and struggled up again. But not quickly enough.    Peter had already gone down two of the cabin steps into the cloud of  thick smoke. He stopped, remembered all he had ever heard of fires,  pulled his soaked handkerchief out of his breast pocket and tied it over  his mouth. As he pulled it out he said:--    \"It's all right, hardly any fire at all.\"    And this, though he thought it was a lie, was rather good of Peter. It  was meant to keep Bobbie from rushing after him into danger. Of course  it didn't.    The cabin glowed red. A paraffin lamp was burning calmly in an orange  mist.    \"Hi,\" said Peter, lifting the handkerchief from his mouth for a moment.  \"Hi, Baby--where are you?\" He choked.    \"Oh, let ME go,\" cried Bobbie, close behind him. Peter pushed her back  more roughly than before, and went on.    Now what would have happened if the baby hadn't cried I don't know--but  just at that moment it DID cry. Peter felt his way through the dark  smoke, found something small and soft and warm and alive, picked it up  and backed out, nearly tumbling over Bobbie who was close behind. A dog  snapped at his leg--tried to bark, choked.    \"I've got the kid,\" said Peter, tearing off the handkerchief and  staggering on to the deck.    Bobbie caught at the place where the bark came from, and her hands met  on the fat back of a smooth-haired dog. It turned and fastened its teeth  on her hand, but very gently, as much as to say:--    \"I'm bound to bark and bite if strangers come into my master's cabin,  but I know you mean well, so I won't REALLY bite.\"    Bobbie dropped the dog.    \"All right, old man. Good dog,\" said she. \"Here--give me the baby,  Peter; you're so wet you'll give it cold.\"    Peter was only too glad to hand over the strange little bundle that  squirmed and whimpered in his arms.    \"Now,\" said Bobbie, quickly, \"you run straight to the 'Rose and Crown'  and tell them. Phil and I will stay here with the precious. Hush, then,  a dear, a duck, a darling! Go NOW, Peter! Run!\"    \"I can't run in these things,\" said Peter, firmly; \"they're as heavy as  lead. I'll walk.\"    \"Then I'LL run,\" said Bobbie. \"Get on the bank, Phil, and I'll hand you  the dear.\"    The baby was carefully handed. Phyllis sat down on the bank and tried to  hush the baby. Peter wrung the water from his sleeves and knickerbocker  legs as well as he could, and it was Bobbie who ran like the wind across  the bridge and up the long white quiet twilight road towards the 'Rose  and Crown.'    There is a nice old-fashioned room at the 'Rose and Crown; where Bargees  and their wives sit of an evening drinking their supper beer, and  toasting their supper cheese at a glowing basketful of coals that  sticks out into the room under a great hooded chimney and is warmer and  prettier and more comforting than any other fireplace _I_ ever saw.    There was a pleasant party of barge people round the fire. You might  not have thought it pleasant, but they did; for they were all friends  or acquaintances, and they liked the same sort of things, and talked  the same sort of talk. This is the real secret of pleasant society. The  Bargee Bill, whom the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines.

A solution is  made by dissolving 20 grams in 10 c.c. of hydrochloric acid and diluting  to 1 litre. The solution is not permanent. It is a strong reducing  agent, and is chiefly used in solution for this purpose.    ~Tin~, Sn.--Grain tin should be purchased. It is not pure, but contains  99.5 per cent. of the metal. The chief impurity is copper. It can be  used as a standard. When acted on with hot hydrochloric acid it slowly  dissolves (more rapidly in contact with platinum) and forms stannous  chloride.    ~Uranium Acetate~, UO_{2}(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}.H_{2}O.--It is best  purchased in crystals. The solution is used for the determination of  phosphates and arsenates. A solution of 3 per cent. strength is  occasionally used as an indicator.    ~Uranium Nitrate~, UO_{2}(NO_{3})_{2}.6H_{2}O.--This salt is very  soluble in water and is sometimes used instead of the acetate, which is  somewhat difficult to dissolve.    \"~Water~,\" H_{2}O.--Spring or well water is sufficiently pure for most  purposes, 100 c.c. will leave a residue of from 10 to 30 milligrams, so  that where a salt has to be dissolved out, evaporated, and weighed it  should be replaced by distilled water. Rain water, melted snow, &c.,  always leave less residue than spring water; but in other respects they  are often dirtier. Distilled water is best prepared in the office, a  glass or tin condenser being used.    ~Zinc~, Zn.--It is sold in a granulated form or in sticks. It generally  contains over 1 per cent. of lead, with a little iron and arsenic. It is  used for separating metals from their solutions, and generally as a  reducing agent. For the preparation of hydrogen, and in most other  cases, scrap sheet zinc may be used.    ~Zinc Oxide~, ZnO.--The commercial oxide sometimes contains carbonate.    ~Zinc Sulphate~, ZnSO_{4}.7H_{2}O.--It is occasionally used as a  standard, and can be purchased nearly pure.

Formulæ and equations are a kind of short hand for expressing briefly  and in the language of the atomic theory the facts of chemical  composition and reaction. The convenience of this method of expressing  the facts justifies a short description of it here.    On comparing the percentage composition of a series of compounds the  proportions in which the elements combine appears to be regulated by no  simple law. For example:                 Realgar.     Orpiment.     Mispickel.     Pyrites.    Arsenic     71.4          60.9          46.0            --    Sulphur     28.6          39.1          19.6           53.3    Iron         --            --           34.4           46.7               ------        ------        ------         ------               100.0         100.0         100.0          100.0    But if in these examples the composition is calculated, not on 100  parts, but on 107, 246, 163, and 120 parts respectively, evidence of a  simple law becomes apparent.                 Realgar.     Orpiment.     Mispickel.     Pyrites.    Arsenic     75.0          150.0         75.0           --    Sulphur     32.0           96.0         32.0          64.0    Iron         --             --          56.0          56.0               ------         ------       ------        ------               107.0          246.0        163.0         120.0    It will be seen that the proportion of arsenic is 75 or twice 75, that  of iron is 56, and that of sulphur 32 or some simple multiple of 32. The  series of examples might be extended indefinitely, and it would still be  found that the \"combining proportions\" held good. The number 75 is  spoken of as the \"combining weight,\" or, more frequently, as the \"atomic  weight\" of arsenic. Similarly 56 is the atomic weight of iron, and 32  the atomic weight of sulphur. The importance of this law of chemical  combination is altogether independent of the atomic theory; but this  theory furnishes the simplest explanation of the facts. According to it  a chemical compound is made up of exactly similar groups of particles.  The particles of each elementary substance are all alike, but differ  from those of other elements in weight. Ultimate particles are called  _atoms_, and the groups of atoms are called _molecules_. The atomic  weight of any particular element is the weight of its atom compared with  the weight of an atom of hydrogen. The atom of sulphur, for instance, is  32 times as heavy as the atom of hydrogen, and the atomic weight of  sulphur is 32. The _molecular weight_ is the sum of the atomic weights  of the group. The molecule of pyrites contains two atoms of sulphur and  one of iron: on referring to the table of atomic weights it will be seen  that the atomic weights are--sulphur 32, and iron 56. The molecular  weight, therefore, is 32+32+56--that is, 120. The meaning of this  is, 120 parts by weight of iron pyrites contain 64 parts of sulphur and  56 parts of iron; and this is true whether the \"parts by weight\" be  grains or tons.    _The symbol or formula of an atom_ is generally the initial letter or  letters of the Latin or English name of the substance. The atom of  hydrogen is written H, that of oxygen O, of sulphur S, of iron (ferrum)  Fe, and so on. A list of these symbols is given in the table of atomic  weights.    _The formula of a molecule_ is obtained by placing together the symbols  of the contained atoms. Thus, Fe represents an atom of iron, S an atom  of sulphur, while FeS represents the molecule of sulphide of iron as  containing one atom of each element.    When more than one atom of an element is present this is shown by  writing a figure under and after the symbol; thus, FeS_{2} represents a  molecule with one atom of iron and two atoms of sulphur, Fe_{2}S_{3}  similarly shows one with two atoms of iron and three of sulphur. When a  group of atoms is enclosed in brackets, a figure after and under the  bracket multiplies all within it; for example, Pb(NO_{3})_{2} is another  way of writing PbN_{2}O_{6}. Sometimes it is convenient to represent the  atoms of a molecule as divided into two or more groups; this may be done  by writing the formulæ of the groups, and separating each simple formula  by a full stop. Slaked lime, for instance, has the formula CaH_{2}O_{2};  or, as already explained, we may write it Ca(HO)_{2}; or, if for  purposes of explanation we wished to look on it as lime (CaO) and water  (H_{2}O), we could write it CaO.H_{2}O. A plus sign (+) has a different  meaning; CaO + H_{2}O indicates quantities of two substances, water and  lime, which are separate from each other. The sign of equality (=) is  generally used to separate a statement of the reagents used from another  statement of the products of the reaction; it may be translated into the  word \"yields\" or \"becomes.\" The two statements form an equation.    Ignoring the quantitative relation, the meaning of the equation CaO +  H_{2}O = CaO.H_{2}O is: \"lime and water yield slaked lime.\" By referring  to a table of atomic weights we can elicit the quantitative relations  thus:--        CaO    +    H_{2}O       =     CaH_{2}O_{2}       |             |                   |       V             V                   V    Ca = 40    H_{2} =  2 = 1×2      Ca  = 40    O  = 16       O  = 16          H_{2} =  2 = 1×2         --            --          O_{2} = 32 = 16×2         56            18                  --                                           74    Or, putting it in words, 56 parts of lime combine with 18 parts of water  to form 74 parts of slaked lime. This equation enables one to answer  such a question as this:--How much lime must be used to produce 1 cwt.  of slaked lime? for, if 74 lbs. of slaked lime require 56 lbs. of lime,  112 lbs. will require (56×112)/74, or about 84-3/4 lbs.    As another example having a closer bearing on assaying take the  following question:--\"In order to assay 5 grams of 'black tin' (SnO_{2})  by the cyanide process, how much potassic cyanide (KCN) will be  required?\" The reaction is          SnO_{2}   +   2KCN    =    Sn + 2KCNO          |             |          V             V       Sn = 118        K = 39    O_{2} =  32        C = 12            ---        N = 14            150            --                           65×2 = 130    What is sought for here is the relation between the quantities of  SnO_{2} and KCN. Note that a figure before a formula multiplies all that  follows up to the next stop or plus or equality sign. The question is  now resolved to this: if 150 grams of oxide of tin require 130 grams of  cyanide, how much will 5 grams require?            150 : 130 :: 5 : _x_                           _x_ = 4.33 grams.    A problem of frequent occurrence is to find the percentage composition  of a substance when its formula has been given. For example: \"What  percentage of iron is contained in a mineral having the formula  2Fe_{2}O_{3}.3H_{2}O?\" Bringing this formula together we have  Fe_{4}H_{6}O_{9}. Find the molecular weight.      Fe_{4}  =   224 = 56×4    H_{6}   =     6 = 1×6    O_{9}   =   144 = 16×9                ---                374    Then we get: 374 parts of the mineral contain 224 of iron. How much will  100 contain?            374 : 224 :: 100 : _x_                             _x_ = 59.89.    And the answer to the question is 59.89 per cent.    Again, suppose the question is of this kind:--\"How much crystallised  copper sulphate (CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O) will be required to make 2 litres of  a solution, 1 c.c. of which shall contain 0.0010 gram of copper?\"    A litre is 1000 c.c., so, therefore, 2 litres of the solution must  contain 0.001 gram × 2000, or 2 grams. How much crystallised copper  sulphate will contain this amount of metal?     "]]]
