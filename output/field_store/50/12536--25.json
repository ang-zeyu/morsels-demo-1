[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#19)"],[1,"half a century has passed since the  tetralogy was written; and in that time the purposes of many half  instinctive acts of genius have become clearer to the common man than  they were to the doers. Some years ago, in the course of an explanation  of Ibsen's plays, I pointed out that it was by no means certain or even  likely that Ibsen was as definitely conscious of his thesis as I. All  the stupid people, and some critics who, though not stupid, had not  themselves written what the Germans call \"tendency\" works, saw nothing  in this but a fantastic affectation of the extravagant self-conceit  of knowing more about Ibsen than Ibsen himself. Fortunately, in taking  exactly the same position now with regard to Wagner, I can claim his own  authority to support me. \"How,\" he wrote to Roeckel on the 23rd. August  1856, \"can an artist expect that what he has felt intuitively should  be perfectly realized by others, seeing that he himself feels in the  presence of his work, if it is true Art, that he is confronted by a  riddle, about which he, too, might have illusions, just as another  might?\"    The truth is, we are apt to deify men of genius, exactly as we deify the  creative force of the universe, by attributing to logical design what  is the result of blind instinct. What Wagner meant by \"true Art\" is the  operation of the artist's instinct, which is just as blind as any other  instinct. Mozart, asked for an explanation of his works, said frankly  \"How do I know?\" Wagner, being a philosopher and critic as well as  a composer, was always looking for moral explanations of what he had  created and he hit on several very striking ones, all different. In the  same way one can conceive Henry the Eighth speculating very brilliantly  about the circulation of his own blood without getting as near the truth  as Harvey did long after his death.    None the less, Wagner's own explanations are of exceptional interest. To  begin with, there is a considerable portion of The Ring, especially the  portraiture of our capitalistic industrial system from the socialist's  point of view in the slavery of the Niblungs and the tyranny of Alberic,  which is unmistakable, as it dramatizes that portion of human activity  which lies well within the territory covered by our intellectual  consciousness. All this is concrete Home Office business, so to speak:  its meaning was as clear to Wagner as it is to us. Not so that part  of the work which deals with the destiny of Wotan. And here, as it  happened, Wagner's recollection of what he had been driving at was  completely upset by his discovery, soon after the completion of The  Ring poem, of Schopenhaur's famous treatise \"The World as Will and  Representation.\" So obsessed did he become with this masterpiece of  philosophic art that he declared that it contained the intellectual  demonstration of the conflict of human forces which he himself had  demonstrated artistically in his great poem. \"I must confess,\" he writes  to Roeckel, \"to having arrived at a clear understanding of my own  works of art through the help of another, who has provided me with the  reasoned conceptions corresponding to my intuitive principles.\"    Schopenhaur, however, had done nothing of the sort. Wagner's  determination to prove that he had been a Schopenhaurite all along  without knowing it only shows how completely the fascination of the  great treatise on The Will had run away with his memory. It is easy to  see how this happened. Wagner says of himself that \"seldom has there  taken place in the soul of one and the same man so profound a division  and estrangement between the intuitive or impulsive part of his nature  and his consciously or reasonably formed ideas.\" And since Schopenhaur's  great contribution to modern thought was to educate us into clear  consciousness of this distinction--a distinction familiar, in a fanciful  way, to the Ages of Faith and Art before the Renascence, but afterwards  swamped in the Rationalism of that movement--it was inevitable that  Wagner should jump at Schopenhaur's metaphysiology (I use a word less  likely to be mistaken than metaphysics) as the very thing for him. But  metaphysiology is one thing, political philosophy another. The political  philosophy of Siegfried is exactly contrary to the political philosophy  of Schopenhaur, although the same clear metaphysiological distinction  between the instinctive part of man (his Will) and his reasoning faculty  (dramatized in The Ring as Loki) is insisted on in both. The difference  is that to Schopenhaur the Will is the universal tormentor of man, the  author of that great evil, Life; whilst reason is the divine gift that  is finally to overcome this life-creating will and lead, through its  abnegation, to cessation and peace, annihilation and Nirvana. This is  the doctrine of Pessimism. Now Wagner was, when he wrote The Ring, a  most sanguine revolutionary Meliorist, contemptuous of the reasoning  faculty, which he typified in the shifty, unreal, delusive Loki, and  full of faith in the life-giving Will, which he typified in the glorious  Siegfried. Not until he read Schopenhaur did he become bent on proving  that he had always been a Pessimist at heart, and that Loki was the most  sensible and worthy adviser of Wotan in The Rhine Gold.    Sometimes he faces the change in his opinions frankly enough. \"My  Niblung drama,\" he writes to Roeckel, \"had taken form at a time when I  had built up with my reason an optimistic world on Hellenic principles,  believing that nothing was necessary for the realization of such a world  but that men should wish it. I ingeniously set aside-the problem why  they did not wish it. I remember that it was with this definite  creative purpose that I conceived the personality of Siegfried, with the  intention of representing an existence free from pain.\" But he appeals  to his earlier works to show that behind all these artificial optimistic  ideas there was always with him an intuition of \"the sublime tragedy of  renunciation, the negation of the will.\" In trying to explain this, he  is full of ideas philosophically, and full of the most amusing  contradictions personally. Optimism, as an accidental excursion into the  barren paths of reason on his own part, he calls \"Hellenic.\" In others  he denounces it as rank Judaism, the Jew having at that time become for  him the whipping boy for all modern humanity. In a letter from London  he expounds Schopenhaur to Roeckel with enthusiasm, preaching the  renunciation of the Will to Live as the redemption from all error and  vain pursuits: in the next letter he resumes the subject with unabated  interest, and finishes by mentioning that on leaving London he went to  Geneva and underwent \"a most beneficial course of hydropathy.\" Seven  months before this he had written as follows: \"Believe me, I too was  once possessed by the idea of a country life. In order to become a  radically healthy human being, I went two years ago to a Hydropathic  Establishment, prepared to give up Art and everything if I could once  more become a child of Nature. But, my good friend, I was obliged to  laugh at my own naivete when I found myself almost going mad. None of  us will reach the promised land: we shall all die in the wilderness.  Intellect is, as some one has said, a sort of disease: it is incurable.\"    Roeckel knew his man of old, and evidently pressed him for explanations  of the inconsistencies of The Ring with Night Falls On The Gods. Wagner  defended himself with unfailing cleverness and occasional petulances,  ranging from such pleas as \"I believe a true instinct has kept me from a  too great definiteness; for it has been borne in on me that an absolute  disclosure of the intention disturbs true insight,\" to a volley of  explanations and commentaries on the explanations. He gets excited and  annoyed because Roeckel will not admire the Brynhild of Night Falls On  The Gods; re-invents the Tarnhelm scene; and finally, the case being  desperate, exclaims, \"It is wrong of you to challenge me to explain it  in words: you must feel that something is being enacted that is not to  be expressed in mere words.\"          THE PESSIMIST AS AMORIST    Sometimes he gets very far away from Pessimism indeed, and recommends  Roeckel to solace his captivity, not by conquering the will to live at  liberty, but by \"the inspiring influences of the Beautiful.\" The next  moment he throws over even Art for Life. \"Where life ends,\" he says,  very wittily, \"Art begins. In youth we turn to Art, we know not why; and  only when we have gone through with Art and come out on the other side,  we learn to our cost that we have missed Life itself.\" His only comfort  is that he is beloved. And on the subject of love he lets himself loose  in a manner that would have roused the bitterest scorn in Schopenhaur,  though, as we have seen (Love Panacea), it is highly characteristic of  Wagner. \"Love in its most perfect reality,\" he says, \"is only possible  between the sexes: it is only as man and woman that human beings can  truly love. Every other manifestation of love can be traced back to that  one absorbingly real feeling, of which all other affections are but an  emanation, a connection, or an imitation. It is an error to look on this  as only one of the forms in which love is revealed, as if there were  other forms coequal with it, or even superior to it. He who after the  manner of metaphysicians prefers UNREALITY to REALITY, and derives the  concrete from the abstract--in short, puts the word before the fact--may  be right in esteeming the idea of love as higher than the expression  of love, and may affirm that actual love made manifest in feeling  is nothing but the outward and visible sign of a pre-existent,  non-sensuous, abstract love; and he will do well to despise that  sensuous function in general. In any case it were safe to bet that such  a man had never loved or been loved as human"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#19)"],[1,"after,\" whispered the happy groom in the ear of his  bride.    A loving, trustful look was her only answer.    A continued rolling of wheels without, and buzz of voices coming from  veranda, hall, and reception rooms, could now be heard.    \"The house must be filling fast,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, \"and as host I should  be present to receive and welcome my guests, Travilla,\" and his voice  trembled slightly, as he took Elsie's right hand and held it for a moment  closely clasped in his; \"I do not fear to trust you with what to me is a  greater treasure than all the gold of California. Cherish my darling as  the apple of your eye; I know you will.\"    He bent down for another silent caress, laid the hand in that of his  friend, and left the room.    \"And you do not fear to trust me, my little friend?\" Travilla's tones,  too, were tremulous with deep feeling.    \"I have not the shadow of a fear,\" she answered, her eyes meeting his with  an earnest, childlike confidence.    \"Bless you for those words, dearest,\" he said; \"God helping me you never  shall have cause to regret them.\"    A door opened, and a handsome, dark eyed boy, a miniature likeness of his  father, came hurrying in. \"Elsie! Papa said I might come and see how  beautiful you are!\" he cried, as if resolutely mastering some strong  emotion, \"but I'm not to say anything to make you cry. I'm not to hug you  hard and spoil your dress. Oh, but you do look like an angel, only  without the wings. Mr. Travilla, you'll be good, _good_ to her, won't  you?\" and the voice almost broke down.    \"I will, indeed, Horace; you may be sure of that. And you needn't feel as  if you are losing her, she'll be back again in a few weeks, please God.\"    \"But not to live at home any more!\" he cried impetuously. \"No, no, I  wasn't to say that, I----\"    \"Come here and kiss me, my dear little brother,\" Elsie said tenderly; \"and  you shall hug me, too, as hard as you like, before I go.\"    He was not slow to accept the invitation, and evidently had a hard  struggle with himself, to refrain from giving the forbidden hug.    \"You may hug me instead, Horace, if you like,\" said Mr. Travilla; \"you  know we're very fond of each other, and are going to be brothers now.\"    \"Yes, that I will, for I do like you ever so much,\" cried the boy,  springing into the arms held out to him, and receiving and returning a  warm embrace, while the sister looked on with eyes glistening with  pleasure.    \"Now, in a few minutes I'll become your brother Edward; and that's what I  want you to call me in future. Will you do it?\"    \"Yes, sir; if papa doesn't forbid me.\"    A light tap at the door leading into the boudoir, and Walter put in his  head. \"The company, the clergy-man, and the hour have come. Are the bride  and groom ready?\"    \"Yes.\"    Releasing the child, Mr. Travilla drew Elsie's hand within his arm. For  an instant he bent his eyes with earnest, questioning gaze upon her face.  It wore an expression that touched him to the heart, so perfectly  trustful, so calmly, peacefully happy, yet with a deep tender solemnity  mingling with and subduing her joy. The soft eyes were misty with unshed  tears as she lifted them to his.    \"It is for life,\" she whispered; \"and I am but young and foolish; shall  you never regret?\"    \"Never, _never_; unless you grow weary of your choice.\"    The answering smile was very sweet and confiding. \"I have not chosen  lightly, and do not fear because it is for life,\" was its unspoken  language.    And truly it was no hasty, ill-considered step she was taking, but one  that had been calmly, thoughtfully pondered in many an hour of solitude  and communion with that unseen Friend whom from earliest youth she had  acknowledged in all her ways, and who had, according to His promise,  directed her paths. There was no excitement, no nervous tremor, about her  then or during the short ceremony that made them no more twain but one  flesh. So absorbed was she in the importance and solemnity of the act she  was performing, that little room was left for thought of anything  else--her personal appearance, or the hundreds of pairs of eyes fixed upon  her; even her father's presence, and the emotions swelling in his breast  were for the time forgotten. Many marked the rapt expression of her face,  and the clear and distinct though low tones of the sweet voice as she  pledged herself to \"love, honor, and obey.\" Mr. Travilla's promise \"to  love, honor, and cherish to life's end,\" was given no less earnestly and  emphatically.    The deed was done; and relatives and friends gathered about them with  kindly salutations and good wishes.    Mr. Dinsmore was the first to salute the bride. \"God bless and keep you,  my daughter,\" were his tenderly whispered words.    \"Dear, dear papa,\" was all she said in response, but her eyes spoke  volumes. \"I am yours still, your very own, and glad it is so,\" they said.    Then came Rose with her tender, silent caress, half-sorrowful,  half-joyful, and Mrs. Travilla with her altogether joyous salutation, \"My  dear daughter, may your cup of happiness be ever filled to overflowing;\"  while Mr. Dinsmore to hide his emotion turned jocosely to Travilla with a  hearty shake of the hand, and \"I wish you joy, my son.\"    \"Thank you, father,\" returned the groom gravely, but with a twinkle of  merriment in his eye.    Aunt Wealthy, standing close by awaiting her turn to greet the bride,  shook her head at her nephew. \"Ah, you are quite too old for that, Horace.  Mr. Vanilla, I wish you joy; but what am I to call you now?\"    \"Edward, if you please, Aunt Wealthy.\"    \"Ah, yes, that will do nicely; it's a good name--so easily forgotten.  Elsie, dearie, you went through it brave as a lion. May you never wish  you'd lived your lane like your auld auntie.\"    \"As if single blessedness could ever be real blessedness!\" sneered Enna,  coming up just in time to catch the last words.    \"Our feelings change as we grow older,\" returned Miss Stanhope, in her  gentle, refined tones, \"and we come to look upon quiet and freedom from  care as very desirable things.\"    \"And I venture to say that old age is not likely to find Mrs. Percival so  happy and contented as is my dear old maiden aunt,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore.    \"Yet we will hope it may, papa,\" said Elsie, receiving Enna's salutation  with kindly warmth.    But the list of relatives, near connections, and intimate friends, is too  long for particular mention of each. All the Dinsmores were there, both  married and single; also most of the Allisons. Harold had not come with  the others, nor had he either accepted or rejected the invitation.    On first raising her eyes upon the conclusion of the ceremony, had Elsie  really seen, far back in the shadow of the doorway, a face white, rigid,  hopeless with misery as his when last they met and parted? She could not  tell; for if really there, it vanished instantly.    \"Did Harold come?\" she asked of Richard when he came to salute the bride  and groom.    \"I think not; I haven't seen him, I can't think what's come over the lad  to be so neglectful of his privileges.\"    Harry Duncan was there, too, hanging upon the smiles of merry, saucy,  blue-eyed May Allison; while her brother Richard seemed equally enamored  with the brunette beauty and sprightliness of Lottie King.    Stiffness and constraint found no place among the guests, after the event  of the evening was over.    In the great dining-room a sumptuous banquet was laid; and thither, after  a time, guests and entertainers repaired.    The table sparkled with cut-glass, rare and costly china, and solid silver  and gold plate. Every delicacy from far and near was to be found upon it;  nothing wanting that the most fastidious could desire, or the most lavish  expenditure furnish. Lovely, fragrant flowers were there also in the  utmost profusion, decorating the board, festooning the windows and  doorways, in bouquets upon the mantels and antique stands, scattered here  and there through the apartment, filling the air with their perfume; while  a distant and unseen band discoursed sweetest music in soft, delicious  strains.    The weather was warmer far than at that season in our northern clime, the  outside air balmy and delightful, and through the wide-open doors and  windows glimpses might be caught of the beautiful grounds, lighted here  and there by a star-like lamp shining out among the foliage. Silent and  deserted they had been all the earlier part of the evening, but now group  after group, as they left the bountiful board, wandered into their green  alleys and gay parterres; low, musical tones, light laughter, and merry  jests floating out upon the quiet night air and waking the echoes of the  hills.    But the bride retired to her own apartments, where white satin, veil, and  orange blossoms, were quickly exchanged for an elegant traveling dress,  scarcely less becoming to her rare beauty.    She reappeared in the library, which had not been thrown open to the  guests, but where the relations and bridesmaids were gathered for the  final good-bye.    Mr. Dinsmore's family carriage, roomy, easy-rolling, and softly cushioned,  stood at the door upon the drive, its spirited gray horses pawing the  ground with impatience to be gone. It would carry the bride and groom--and  a less pretentious vehicle their servants--in two hours to the seaport  where they were to take the steamer for New Orleans; for their honeymoon  was to be spent at Viamede, Elsie still adhering to the plan of a year  ago.    Her adieus were gayly given to one and another, beginning with those least  dear; very very affectionately to Mrs. Travilla, Aunt Wealthy, Rose, and  the little Horace (the sleeping Rosebud had already been softly kissed in  her crib).    Her idolized father only remained; and now all her gayety forsook her, all  her calmness gave way, and clinging about his neck, \"Papa, papa, oh papa!\"  she cried, with a burst of tears and"]]]
