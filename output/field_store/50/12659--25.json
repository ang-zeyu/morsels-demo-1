And what danger is it, M. de Chagny?\"    \"An impostor is abusing her good faith.\"    \"Is the Angel of Music an impostor?\"    \"She told you herself that there is no Angel of Music.\"    \"But then what is it, in Heaven's name?  You will be the death of me!\"    \"There is a terrible mystery around us, madame, around you, around  Christine, a mystery much more to be feared than any number of ghosts  or genii!\"    Mamma Valerius turned a terrified face to Christine, who had already  run to her adopted mother and was holding her in her arms.    \"Don't believe him, mummy, don't believe him,\" she repeated.    \"Then tell me that you will never leave me again,\" implored the widow.    Christine was silent and Raoul resumed.    \"That is what you must promise, Christine.  It is the only thing that  can reassure your mother and me.  We will undertake not to ask you a  single question about the past, if you promise us to remain under our  protection in future.\"    \"That is an undertaking which I have not asked of you and a promise  which I refuse to make you!\" said the young girl haughtily.  \"I am  mistress of my own actions, M. de Chagny: you have no right to control  them, and I will beg you to desist henceforth.  As to what I have done  during the last fortnight, there is only one man in the world who has  the right to demand an account of me: my husband!  Well, I have no  husband and I never mean to marry!\"    She threw out her hands to emphasize her words and Raoul turned pale,  not only because of the words which he had heard, but because he had  caught sight of a plain gold ring on Christine's finger.    \"You have no husband and yet you wear a wedding-ring.\"    He tried to seize her hand, but she swiftly drew it back.    \"That's a present!\" she said, blushing once more and vainly striving to  hide her embarrassment.    \"Christine!  As you have no husband, that ring can only have been given  by one who hopes to make you his wife!  Why deceive us further?  Why  torture me still more?  That ring is a promise; and that promise has  been accepted!\"    \"That's what I said!\" exclaimed the old lady.    \"And what did she answer, madame?\"    \"What I chose,\" said Christine, driven to exasperation.  \"Don't you  think, monsieur, that this cross-examination has lasted long enough?  As far as I am concerned ...\"    Raoul was afraid to let her finish her speech.  He interrupted her:    \"I beg your pardon for speaking as I did, mademoiselle.  You know the  good intentions that make me meddle, just now, in matters which, you no  doubt think, have nothing to do with me.  But allow me to tell you what  I have seen--and I have seen more than you suspect, Christine--or what  I thought I saw, for, to tell you the truth, I have sometimes been  inclined to doubt the evidence of my eyes.\"    \"Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?\"    \"I saw your ecstasy AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICE, Christine:  the voice  that came from the wall or the next room to yours ... yes, YOUR  ECSTASY!  And that is what makes me alarmed on your behalf.  You are  under a very dangerous spell.  And yet it seems that you are aware of  the imposture, because you say to-day THAT THERE IS NO ANGEL OF MUSIC!  In that case, Christine, why did you follow him that time?  Why did you  stand up, with radiant features, as though you were really hearing  angels? ... Ah, it is a very dangerous voice, Christine, for I myself,  when I heard it, was so much fascinated by it that you vanished before  my eyes without my seeing which way you passed!  Christine, Christine,  in the name of Heaven, in the name of your father who is in Heaven now  and who loved you so dearly and who loved me too, Christine, tell us,  tell your benefactress and me, to whom does that voice belong?  If you  do, we will save you in spite of yourself.  Come, Christine, the name  of the man!  The name of the man who had the audacity to put a ring on  your finger!\"    \"M. de Chagny,\" the girl declared coldly, \"you shall never know!\"    Thereupon, seeing the hostility with which her ward had addressed the  viscount, Mamma Valerius suddenly took Christine's part.    \"And, if she does love that man, Monsieur le Vicomte, even then it is  no business of yours!\"    \"Alas, madame,\" Raoul humbly replied, unable to restrain his tears,  \"alas, I believe that Christine really does love him! ... But it is not  only that which drives me to despair; for what I am not certain of,  madame, is that the man whom Christine loves is worthy of her love!\"    \"It is for me to be the judge of that, monsieur!\" said Christine,  looking Raoul angrily in the face.    \"When a man,\" continued Raoul, \"adopts such romantic methods to entice  a young girl's affections. ..\"    \"The man must be either a villain, or the girl a fool:  is that it?\"    \"Christine!\"    \"Raoul, why do you condemn a man whom you have never seen, whom no one  knows and about whom you yourself know nothing?\"    \"Yes, Christine ...  Yes ...  I at least know the name that you thought  to keep from me for ever ...  The name of your Angel of Music,  mademoiselle, is Erik!\"    Christine at once betrayed herself.  She turned as white as a sheet and  stammered:  \"Who told you?\"    \"You yourself!\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"By pitying him the other night, the night of the masked ball.  When  you went to your dressing-room, did you not say, 'Poor Erik?' Well,  Christine, there was a poor Raoul who overheard you.\"    \"This is the second time that you have listened behind the door, M. de  Chagny!\"    \"I was not behind the door ... I was in the dressing-room, in the inner  room, mademoiselle.\"    \"Oh, unhappy man!\" moaned the girl, showing every sign of unspeakable  terror.  \"Unhappy man!  Do you want to be killed?\"    \"Perhaps.\"    Raoul uttered this \"perhaps\" with so much love and despair in his voice  that Christine could not keep back a sob.  She took his hands and  looked at him with all the pure affection of which she was capable:    \"Raoul,\" she said, \"forget THE MAN'S VOICE and do not even remember its  name... You must never try to fathom the mystery of THE MAN'S VOICE.\"    \"Is the mystery so very terrible?\"    \"There is no more awful mystery on this earth.  Swear to me that you  will make no attempt to find out,\" she insisted.  \"Swear to me that you  will never come to my dressing-room, unless I send for you.\"    \"Then you promise to send for me sometimes, Christine?\"    \"I promise.\"    \"When?\"    \"To-morrow.\"    \"Then I swear to do as you ask.\"    He kissed her hands and went away, cursing Erik and resolving to be  patient.        Chapter XI  Above the Trap-Doors      The next day, he saw her at the Opera.  She was still wearing the plain  gold ring.  She was gentle and kind to him.  She talked to him of the  plans which he was forming, of his future, of his career.    He told her that the date of the Polar expedition had been put forward  and that he would leave France in three weeks, or a month at latest.  She suggested, almost gaily, that he must look upon the voyage with  delight, as a stage toward his coming fame.  And when he replied that  fame without love was no attraction in his eyes, she treated him as a  child whose sorrows were only short-lived.    \"How can you speak so lightly of such serious things?\" he asked.  \"Perhaps we shall never see each other again!  I may die during that  expedition.\"    \"Or I,\" she said simply.    She no longer smiled or jested.  She seemed to be thinking of some new  thing that had entered her mind for the first time.  Her eyes were all  aglow with it.    \"What are you thinking of, Christine?\"    \"I am thinking that we shall not see each other again ...\"    \"And does that make you so radiant?\"    \"And that, in a month, we shall have to say good-by for ever!\"    \"Unless, Christine, we pledge our faith and wait for each other for  ever.\"    She put her hand on his mouth.    \"Hush, Raoul! ... You know there is no question of that ...  And we  shall never be married:  that is understood!\"    She seemed suddenly almost unable to contain an overpowering gaiety.  She clapped her hands with childish glee.  Raoul stared at her in  amazement.    \"But ... but,\" she continued, holding out her two hands to Raoul, or  rather giving them to him, as though she had suddenly resolved to make  him a present of them, \"but if we can not be married, we can ... we can  be engaged!  Nobody will know but ourselves, Raoul.  There have been  plenty of secret marriages:  why not a secret engagement? ... We are  engaged, dear, for a month!  In a month, you will go away, and I can be  happy at the thought of that month all my life long!\"    She was enchanted with her inspiration.  Then she became serious again.    \"This,\" she said, \"IS A HAPPINESS THAT WILL HARM NO ONE.\"    Raoul jumped at the idea.  He bowed to Christine and said:    \"Mademoiselle, I have the honor to ask for your hand.\"    \"Why, you have both of them already, my dear betrothed! ...  Oh, Raoul,  how happy we shall be! ... We must play at being engaged all day long.\"    It was the prettiest game in the world and they enjoyed it like the  children that they were.  Oh, the wonderful speeches they made to each  other and the eternal vows they exchanged!  They played at hearts as  other children might play at ball; only, as it was really their two  hearts that they flung to and fro, they had to be very, very handy to  catch them, each time, without hurting them.    One day, about a week after the game began, Raoul's heart was badly  hurt and he stopped playing and uttered these wild words:    \"I shan't go to the North Pole!\"    Christine, who, in her innocence, had not dreamed of such a  possibility, suddenly discovered the danger of the game and reproached  herself bitterly.  She did not say a word in reply to Raoul's remark  and went straight home.    This happened in the afternoon, in the singer's dressing-room,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#19)"],[1,"her own window. Opening it, she jumped  in. Turning to pull it down she saw the old lady disappear from the  doorway of the moon, saw the door close upon her, saw the Wake of  Gold melt and fall into the sea where it lay in a million gleaming  spangles, saw the moon float up into the sky, growing smaller and  smaller and paler and paler until it was no larger than a silver  plate. And now it was the moon no longer--it was the sun. Its rays  were shining hot on her face. She was back in her little bed. Her  mother's arms were about her and Klara was saying, 'I'm SORRY. I  WILL NEVER DO SO AGAIN.'\"                            ----------------------    For a long time after Billy finished the room was very quiet. Then  suddenly Rosie jumped to her feet. \"That was a lovely story, Billy,\"  she said. \"But I guess I don't want to hear any more now. I think  I'll go home.\"                                       CHAPTER IX: WORK      It was still raining when Maida got up the next day. It rained all  the morning. She listened carefully at a quarter to twelve for the  one-session bell but it did not ring. Just before school began in  the afternoon Rosie came into the shop. Maida saw at once that  something had happened to her. Rosie's face looked strange and she  dragged across the room instead of pattering with her usual quick,  light step.    \"What do you think's happened, Maida?\" Rosie asked.    \"I don't know. Oh, what?\" Maida asked affrighted.    \"When I came home from school this noon mother wasn't there. But  Aunt Theresa was there--she'd cooked the dinner. She said that mother  had gone away for a visit and that she wouldn't be back for some  time. She said she was going to keep house for father and me while  mother was gone. I feel dreadfully homesick and lonesome without  mother.\"    \"Oh Rosie, I am sorry,\" Maida said. \"But perhaps your mother won't  stay long. Do you like your Aunt Theresa?\"    \"Oh, yes, I like her. But of course she isn't mother.\"    \"No, of course. Nobody is like your mother.\"    \"Oh, yes; there's something else I had to tell you. The W.M.N.T.'s  are going to meet at Dicky's after school this afternoon. Be sure to  come, Maida.\"    \"Of course I'll come.\" Maida's whole face sparkled. \"That is, if  Granny doesn't think it's too wet.\"    Rosie lingered for a few moments but she did not seem like her usual  happy-go-lucky self. And when she left, Maida noticed that instead  of running across the street she actually walked.    All the morning long Maida talked of nothing to Granny but the  prospective meeting of the W.M.N.T.'s. \"Just think, Granny, I never  belonged to a club before,\" she said again and again.    Very early she had put out on her bed the clothes that she intended  to wear--a tanbrown serge of which she was particularly fond, and her  favorite \"tire\" of a delicate, soft lawn. She kept rushing to the  window to study the sky. It continued to look like the inside of a  dull tin cup. She would not have eaten any lunch at all if Granny  had not told her that she must. And her heart sank steadily all the  afternoon for the rain continued to come down.    \"I don't suppose I can go, Granny,\" she faltered when the clock  struck four.    \"Sure an you _can_,\" Granny responded briskly.    But she wrapped Maida up, as Maida herself said: \"As if I was one of  papa's carved crystals come all the way from China.\"    First Granny put on a sweater, then a coat, then over all a  raincoat. She put a hood on her head and a veil over that. She made  her wear rubber boots and take an umbrella. Maida got into a gale of  laughter during the dressing.    \"I ought to be wrapped in excelsior now,\" she said. \"If I fall down  in the puddle in the court, Granny,\" she threatened merrily, \"I  never can pick myself up. I'll either have to roll and roll and roll  until I get on to dry land or I'll have to wait until somebody comes  and shovels me out.\"    But she did not fall into the puddle. She walked carefully along the  edge and then ran as swiftly as her clothes and lameness would  permit. She arrived in Dicky's garret, red-cheeked and breathless.    Arthur and Rosie had already come. Rosie was playing on the floor  with Delia and the puppy that she had rescued from the tin-can  persecution. Rosie was growling, the dog was yelping and Delia was  squealing--but all three with delight.    Arthur and Dicky sat opposite each other, working at the round  table.    \"What do you think of that dog now, Maida?\" Rosie asked proudly.  \"His name is 'Tag.' You wouldn't know him for the same dog, would  you? Isn't he a nice-looking little puppy?\"    Tag did look like another dog. He wore a collar and his yellowy coat  shone like satin. His whole manner had changed. He came running over  to Maida and stood looking at her with the most spirited air in the  world, his head on one side, one paw up and one ear cocked  inquisitively. His tail wriggled so fast that Delia thinking it some  wonderful new toy, kept trying to catch it and hold it in her little  fingers.    \"He's a lovely doggie,\" Maida said. \"I wish I'd brought Fluff.\"    \"And did you ever see such a dear baby,\" Rosie went on, hugging  Delia. \"Oh, if I only had a baby brother or sister!\"    \"She's a darling,\" Maida agreed heartily. \"Babies are so much more  fun than dolls, don't you think so, Rosie?\"    \"Dolls!\" No words can express the contempt that was in Miss Brine's  accent.    \"What are you doing, Dicky?\" Maida asked, limping over to the table.    \"Making things,\" Dicky said cheerfully.    On the table were piles of mysterious-looking objects made entirely  of paper. Some were of white paper and others of brown, but they  were all decorated with trimmings of colored tissue.    \"What are they?\" Maida asked. \"Aren't they lovely? I never saw  anything like them in my life.\"    Dicky blushed all over his face at this compliment but it was  evident that he was delighted. \"Well, those are paper-boxes,\" he  said, pointing to the different piles of things, \"and those are  steamships. Those are the old-fashioned kind with double  smokestacks. Those are double-boats, jackets, pants, badges,  nose-pinchers, lamp-lighters, firemen's caps and soldier caps.\"    \"Oh, that's why you buy all that colored paper,\" Maida said in a  tone of great satisfaction. \"I've often wondered.\" She examined  Dicky's work carefully. She could see that it was done with  remarkable precision and skill. \"Oh, what fun to do things like  that. I do wish you'd show me how to make them, Dicky. I'm such a  useless girl. I can't make a single thing.\"    \"I'll show you, sure,\" Dicky offered generously.    \"What are you making so many for?\" Maida queried.    \"Well, you see it's this way,\" Dicky began in a business-like air.  \"Arthur and Rosie and I are going to have a fair. We've had a fair  every spring and every fall for the last three years. That's how we  get our money for Christmas and the Fourth of July. Arthur whittles  things out of wood--he'll show you what he can do in a minute--he's a  crackajack. Rosie makes candy. And I make these paper things.\"    \"And do you make much money?\" Maida asked, deeply interested.    \"Don't make any money at all,\" Dicky said. \"The children pay us in  nails. I charge them ten nails a-piece for the easy things and twenty  nails for the hardest. Arthur can get more for his stuff because  it's harder to do.\"    \"But what do you want nails for?\" Maida asked in bewilderment.    \"Why, nails are junk.\"    \"And what's junk?\"    The three children stared at her. \"Don't you know what _junk_ is,  Maida?\" Rosie asked in despair.    \"No.\"    \"Junk's old iron,\" Dicky explained. \"And you sell it to the junkman.  Once we made forty cents out of one of these fairs. One reason we're  beginning so early this year, I've got something very particular I  want to buy my mother for a Christmas present. Can you keep a  secret, Maida?\"    Maida nodded.    \"Well, it's a fur collar for her neck. They have them down in a  store on Main street every winter--two dollars and ninetyeight cents.  It seems an awful lot but I've got over a dollar saved up. And I  guess I can do it if I work hard.\"    \"How much have you made ordinarily?\" Maida asked thoughtfully.    \"Once we made forty cents a-piece but that's the most.\"    \"I tell you what you do,\" Maida burst out impetuously after a moment  of silence in which she considered this statement. \"When the time  comes for you to hold your fair, I'll lend you my shop for a day.  I'll take all the things out of the window and I'll clean all the  shelves off and you boys can put your things there. I'll clear out  the showcases for Rosie's candy. Won't that be lovely?\" She smiled  happily.    \"It would be grand business for us,\" Dicky said soberly, \"but  somehow it doesn't seem quite fair to you.\"    \"Oh, please don't think of that,\" Maida said. \"I'd just love to do  it. And you must teach me how to make things so that I can help you.  You will take the shop, Dicky?\" she pleaded. \"And you, Rosie? And  Arthur?\" She looked from one to the other with all her heart in her  eyes.    But nobody spoke for a moment. \"It seems somehow as if we oughtn't  to,\" Dicky said awkwardly at last.    Maida's lip trembled. At first she could not understand. Here she  was aching to do a kindness to these three friends of hers. And  they, for some unknown reason, would not permit it. It was not that  they disliked her, she knew. What was it? She tried to put herself  in their place. Suddenly it came to her what the difficulty was.  They did not want to be so much in her debt. How could she prevent  that? She must let them do something for her that would lessen that  debt. But what? She thought very hard. In a flash it came to her--a  plan by which she could make it all right.    \"You see,\" she began eagerly, \"I wanted to ask you three to help me  in something, but I can't do it unless you let me help you.  Listen--the next holiday is Halloween. I want to decorate my shop  with "]]]
