To what depths of infamy and cruelty would not this same enemy  be willing to descend now that an act so treasonable, so audacious had  been committed? What accusations would it not be prompted to level at, and  what treatment would it not mete out to, those who, however unjustifiably,  could be associated with so heinous a crime against one who, in his  person, combined the chief magistracy of the realm and the trusteeship of  the Hidden Imam?    The reign of terror which ensued was revolting beyond description. The  spirit of revenge that animated those who had unleashed its horrors seemed  insatiable. Its repercussions echoed as far as the press of Europe,  branding with infamy its bloodthirsty participants. The Grand Vizir,  wishing to reduce the chances of blood revenge, divided the work of  executing those condemned to death among the princes and nobles, his  principal fellow-ministers, the generals and officers of the Court, the  representatives of the sacerdotal and merchant classes, the artillery and  the infantry. Even the _Sh_ah himself had his allotted victim, though, to  save the dignity of the crown, he delegated the steward of his household  to fire the fatal shot on his behalf. Ardi_sh_ir Mirza, on his part,  picketed the gates of the capital, and ordered the guards to scrutinize  the faces of all those who sought to leave it. Summoning to his presence  the kalantar, the daru_gh_ih and the kad_kh_udas he bade them search out  and arrest every one suspected of being a Babi. A youth named Abbas, a  former servant of a well-known adherent of the Faith, was, on threat of  inhuman torture, induced to walk the streets of Tihran, and point out  every one he recognized as being a Babi. He was even coerced into  denouncing any individual whom he thought would be willing and able to pay  a heavy bribe to secure his freedom.    The first to suffer on that calamitous day was the ill-fated Sadiq, who  was instantly slain on the scene of his attempted crime. His body was tied  to the tail of a mule and dragged all the way to Tihran, where it was hewn  into two halves, each of which was suspended and exposed to the public  view, while the Tihranis were invited by the city authorities to mount the  ramparts and gaze upon the mutilated corpse. Molten lead was poured down  the throat of his accomplice, after having subjected him to the torture of  red-hot pincers and limb-rending screws. A comrade of his, Haji Qasim, was  stripped of his clothes, lighted candles were thrust into holes made in  his flesh, and was paraded before the multitude who shouted and cursed  him. Others had their eyes gouged out, were sawn asunder, strangled, blown  from the mouths of cannons, chopped in pieces, hewn apart with hatchets  and maces, shod with horse shoes, bayoneted and stoned. Torture-mongers  vied with each other in running the gamut of brutality, while the  populace, into whose hands the bodies of the hapless victims were  delivered, would close in upon their prey, and would so mutilate them as  to leave no trace of their original form. The executioners, though  accustomed to their own gruesome task, would themselves be amazed at the  fiendish cruelty of the populace. Women and children could be seen led  down the streets by their executioners, their flesh in ribbons, with  candles burning in their wounds, singing with ringing voices before the  silent spectators: \"Verily from God we come, and unto Him we return!\" As  some of the children expired on the way their tormentors would fling their  bodies under the feet of their fathers and sisters who, proudly treading  upon them, would not deign to give them a second glance. A father,  according to the testimony of a distinguished French writer, rather than  abjure his faith, preferred to have the throats of his two young sons,  both already covered with blood, slit upon his breast, as he lay on the  ground, whilst the elder of the two, a lad of fourteen, vigorously  pressing his right of seniority, demanded to be the first to lay down his  life.    An Austrian officer, Captain Von Goumoens, in the employ of the _Sh_ah at  that time, was, it is reliably stated, so horrified at the cruelties he  was compelled to witness that he tendered his resignation. \"Follow me, my  friend,\" is the Captain's own testimony in a letter he wrote two weeks  after the attempt in question, which was published in the  \"Soldatenfreund,\" \"you who lay claim to a heart and European ethics,  follow me to the unhappy ones who, with gouged-out eyes, must eat, on the  scene of the deed, without any sauce, their own amputated ears; or whose  teeth are torn out with inhuman violence by the hand of the executioner;  or whose bare skulls are simply crushed by blows from a hammer; or where  the bazaar is illuminated with unhappy victims, because on right and left  the people dig deep holes in their breasts and shoulders, and insert  burning wicks in the wounds. I saw some dragged in chains through the  bazaar, preceded by a military band, in whom these wicks had burned so  deep that now the fat flickered convulsively in the wound like a newly  extinguished lamp. Not seldom it happens that the unwearying ingenuity of  the Oriental leads to fresh tortures. They will skin the soles of the  Babi's feet, soak the wounds in boiling oil, shoe the foot like the hoof  of a horse, and compel the victim to run. No cry escaped from the victim's  breast; the torment is endured in dark silence by the numbed sensation of  the fanatic; now he must run; the body cannot endure what the soul has  endured; he falls. Give him the coup de grace! Put him out of his pain!  No! The executioner swings the whip, and--I myself have had to witness  it--the unhappy victim of hundredfold tortures runs! This is the beginning  of the end. As for the end itself, they hang the scorched and perforated  bodies by their hands and feet to a tree head downwards, and now every  Persian may try his marksmanship to his heart's content from a fixed but  not too proximate distance on the noble quarry placed at his disposal. I  saw corpses torn by nearly one hundred and fifty bullets.\" \"When I read  over again,\" he continues, \"what I have written, I am overcome by the  thought that those who are with you in our dearly beloved Austria may  doubt the full truth of the picture, and accuse me of exaggeration. Would  to God that I had not lived to see it! But by the duties of my profession  I was unhappily often, only too often, a witness of these abominations. At  present I never leave my house, in order not to meet with fresh scenes of  horror... Since my whole soul revolts against such infamy ... I will no  longer maintain my connection with the scene of such crimes.\" Little  wonder that a man as far-famed as Renan should, in his \"Les Apotres\" have  characterized the hideous butchery perpetrated in a single day, during the  great massacre of Tihran, as \"a day perhaps unparalleled in the history of  the world!\"    The hand that was stretched to deal so grievous a blow to the adherents of  a sorely-tried Faith did not confine itself to the rank and file of the  Bab's persecuted followers. It was raised with equal fury and  determination against, and struck down with equal force, the few remaining  leaders who had survived the winnowing winds of adversity that had already  laid low so vast a number of the supporters of the Faith. Tahirih, that  immortal heroine who had already shed imperishable luster alike on her sex  and on the Cause she had espoused, was swept into, and ultimately engulfed  by, the raging storm. Siyyid Husayn, the amanuensis of the Bab, the  companion of His exile, the trusted repository of His last wishes, and the  witness of the prodigies attendant upon His martyrdom, fell likewise a  victim of its fury. That hand had even the temerity to lift itself against  the towering figure of Baha'u'llah. But though it laid hold of Him it  failed to strike Him down. It imperilled His life, it imprinted on His  body indelible marks of a pitiless cruelty, but was impotent to cut short  a career that was destined not only to keep alive the fire which the  Spirit of the Bab had kindled, but to produce a conflagration that would  at once consummate and outshine the glories of His Revelation.    During those somber and agonizing days when the Bab was no more, when the  luminaries that had shone in the firmament of His Faith had been  successively extinguished, when His nominee, a \"bewildered fugitive, in  the guise of a dervish, with ka_sh_kul (alms-basket) in hand\" roamed the  mountains and plains in the neighborhood of Ra_sh_t, Baha'u'llah, by  reason of the acts He had performed, appeared in the eyes of a vigilant  enemy as its most redoubtable adversary and as the sole hope of an as yet  unextirpated heresy. His seizure and death had now become imperative. He  it was Who, scarce three months after the Faith was born, received,  through the envoy of the Bab, Mulla Husayn, the scroll which bore to Him  the first tidings of a newly announced Revelation, Who instantly acclaimed  its truth, and arose to champion its cause. It was to His native city and  dwelling place that the steps of that envoy were first directed, as the  place which enshrined \"a Mystery of such transcendent holiness as neither  Hijaz nor _Sh_iraz can hope to rival.\" It was Mulla Husayn's report of the  contact thus established which had been received with such exultant joy by  the Bab, and had brought such reassurance to His heart as to finally  decide Him to undertake His contemplated pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.  Baha'u'llah alone was the object and the center of the cryptic allusions,  the glowing eulogies, the fervid prayers, the joyful announcements and the  dire"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#19)"],[1,", Baha'u'llah said, \"Do not speak of this, ever  again. Do not so much as utter a word about those estates.\" Meanwhile the  exile from Adrianople to Akka took place. Mirza Muhammad went to the  Government authorities and said to them: \"I am the deputy (vakil) of  Baha'u'llah. These properties do not belong to Mirza Musa. How is it that  you have taken them over?\" But he had no documents to support him, for the  title deeds were in Akka, and on this account the Government rejected his  claim. However, in the process, he became known to all as Mirza Muhammad  the Deputy. This is how he received the title.    When we were in Adrianople, Mirza Musa sent on the ruby ring, through  Siyyid 'Ali-Akbar, and the Blessed Beauty directed us to accept it. After  we reached Akka the believers fell ill, and lay suffering in their beds. I  sent the ring to India, to one of the friends, asking him to sell it with  all possible speed and forward the proceeds to us in Akka to be expended  on the sick. That blessed individual never sent us a penny. Two years  later he wrote to say that he had sold the ring for twenty-five pounds and  had spent that sum on the pilgrims. This, when the ring was of such great  value. I made no complaint. Rather, I praised God, thanking Him that out  of all that wealth not a fleck of dust had settled on my robe.    Mirza Muhammad was taken prisoner and sent away from Ba_gh_dad to Mosul,  where he fell a prey to fearful ills. He had been rich; in God's path he  was now poor. He had enjoyed his ease and comfort; now, for the love of  God, he suffered pain and toil. He lived on for a time in Mosul,  suppliant, resigned, and lowly. And then, severed from all save God,  irresistibly drawn by the gentle gales of the Lord, he rose out of this  dark world to the land of light. Unto him be salutations and praise. May  God shed down upon him the waters of forgiveness, and open before his  grave the gates of Heaven.            HAJI MUHAMMAD-RIDAY-I-SHIRAZI      Haji Muhammad-Rida came from _Sh_iraz. He was a man spiritually minded,  lowly, contrite, the embodiment of serenity and faith. When the call of  God was lifted up, that needy soul hurried into the shelter of heavenly  grace. As soon as he heard the summons, \"Am I not your Lord?\" he cried  out: \"Yea, verily!\"(68) and became as a lamp to the people's feet.    For a long time he served the Afnan, Haji Mirza Muhammad-'Ali, and was his  loyal and close companion, trusted in all things. Later, following a  journey to distant countries, he went to the Holy Land, and there in utter  submission and lowliness bowed his head before the Sacred Threshold and  was honored with entering the presence of Baha'u'llah, where he drank in  endless bounties from cupped hands. For quite a time he remained there,  attending upon Baha'u'llah almost every day, encompassed by holy favor and  grace. He was outstanding as to character, and lived after the  commandments of God: tranquil and long-suffering, in his surrender to  God's will he was selflessness itself. He had no personal aims whatever,  no feeling of attachment to this fleeting world. His one desire was to  please his Lord, his one hope, to walk the holy path.    He went on, then, to Beirut, serving the honored Afnan in that city. He  spent a long time in this wise, returning again and again to enter the  presence of Baha'u'llah and gaze upon that Most Great Beauty. Later, in  Sidon, he fell ill. Unable to make the journey to Akka, in perfect  acquiescence and contentment he ascended to the Abha Kingdom, and was  plunged in the ocean of lights. By the Supreme Pen, endless bounty was  bestowed upon his memory. He was indeed one of the loyal, the steadfast, a  solid pillar of servitude to Baha'u'llah. Many and many a time, from the  lips of the Blessed Beauty, we heard his praise.    Unto him be greetings and praise, and the glory of the All-Glorious. Upon  him be compassion and most great mercy from the Lord of the High Heavens.  His shining grave is in Sidon, near the place called the Station of John  the Holy.            HUSAYN EFFENDI TABRIZI      This youth was from Tabriz, and he was filled with the love of God like a  cup flowing and brimming over with red wine. In the flower of his youth he  left Persia and traveled to Greece, making his living as a merchant there;  till a day came when, guided by Divine bounty, he went from Greece to  Smyrna, and there he was given the glad tidings of a new Manifestation on  earth. He shouted aloud, was frenzied, was drunk with the music of the new  message. He escaped from his debits and credits, set out to meet the Lord  of his heart, and entered the presence of Baha'u'llah. For some time, a  trusted attendant and companion, he served the Blessed Beauty. He was then  directed to seek a lodging in the city of Haifa.    Here he faithfully waited upon the believers, and his home was a way  station for Baha'i travelers. He had an excellent disposition, a wonderful  character, and high, spiritual aims. He was friendly with friend and  stranger alike; he was kind to people of every nation and wished them  well.    When the Most Great Light ascended to the Concourse above, Husayn Effendi  remained faithful to Him, steadfast and firm; and as before, he continued  to be a close friend to the friends. Thus he lived for a considerable  period, and felt himself better off than the kings of the earth. He became  the son-in-law of Mirza Muhammad-Quli, brother of the Blessed Beauty, and  remained for a time peaceful and serene. He carefully avoided any occasion  of being seduced into error, for he dreaded that the tempest of  afflictions might mount in fury, surge ever higher, and sweep many a soul  into the fathomless gulf.(69) He would sigh and mourn, for this fear was  with him at all times. At last he could bear the world no longer, and with  his own hands stripped off the garment of life.    Praise be unto him, and salutations, and the mercy of God, and Divine  acceptance. May God pardon him and make him to enter the highest Heaven,  the Paradise that towers above all the rest. His sweet-scented grave is in  Haifa.            JAMSHID-I-GURJI      Yet another of the emigrants and settlers was the valiant  Jam_sh_id-i-Gurji, who came from Georgia, but grew up in the city of  Ka_sh_an. He was a fine youth, faithful, trustworthy, with a high sense of  honor. When he heard of a new Faith dawning, and awoke to the tidings that  on Persia's horizons the Sun of Truth had risen, he was filled with holy  ecstasy, and he longed and loved. The new fire burned away those veils of  uncertainty and doubt that had closed him round; the light of Truth shed  down its rays, the lamp of guidance burned before him.    He remained in Persia for a time, then left for Rumelia, which was Ottoman  territory, and in the Land of Mystery, Adrianople, won the honor of  entering the presence of Baha'u'llah; it was there that his meeting took  place. His joy and fervor were boundless. Later, at Baha'u'llah's command  he made a journey to Constantinople, with Aqa Muhammad-Baqir and Aqa  'Abdu'l-_Gh_affar. In that city, the tyrannous imprisoned him and put him  in chains.    The Persian ambassador informed against Jam_sh_id and Ustad  Muhammad-'Ali-i-Dallak as enemy leaders and fighters. Jam_sh_id he  described as a latter-day Rustam(70) while Muhammad-'Ali, according to the  envoy, was a ravening lion. These two respected men were first imprisoned  and caged; then they were sent out of Turkish territory, under guard to  the Persian frontier. They were to be delivered over to the Persian  Government and crucified, and the guards were threatened with terrible  punishments should they once relax their vigilance and let the prisoners  escape. For this reason, at every stopping place the victims were kept in  some almost inaccessible spot. Once they were thrown into a pit, a kind of  well, and suffered agonies all through the night. The next morning  Jam_sh_id cried out: \"O you who oppress us! Are we Joseph the Prophet that  you have thrown us in this well? Remember how He rose out of the well as  high as the full moon? We too walk the pathway of God, we too are down  here for His sake, and we know that these depths are the heights of the  Lord.\"    Once arrived at the Persian frontier, Jam_sh_id and Muhammad-'Ali were  handed over to Kurdish chiefs to be sent on to Tihran. The Kurdish chiefs  could see that the prisoners were innocent men, kindly and well-disposed,  who had fallen a prey to their enemies. Instead of dispatching them to the  capital, they set them free. Joyfully, the two hastened away on foot, went  back to Baha'u'llah and found a home close by Him in the Most Great  Prison.    Jam_sh_id spent some time in utter bliss, receiving the grace and favor of  Baha'u'llah and ever and again being admitted to His presence. He was  tranquil and at peace. The believers were well-pleased with him, and he  was well-pleased with God. It was in this condition that he hearkened to  the celestial bidding: \"O thou soul who art well-assured, return unto thy  Lord, well-pleased with Him, and well-pleasing unto Him.\"(71) And to God's  cry: \"Return!\" he replied, \"Yea, verily!\" He rose out of the Most Great  Prison to the highest Heaven; he soared away to a pure and gleaming  Kingdom, out of this world of dust. May God succor him in the celestial  company,(72) bring him into the Paradise of Splendors, and safe in the  Divine gardens, make him to live forevermore.    Salutations be unto him, and praise. His grave, sweet as musk, is in Akka.            HAJI JA'FAR-I-TABRIZI AND HIS BROTHERS      There were three brothers, all from Tabriz: Haji Hasan, Haji Ja'far, and  Haji Taqi. These three were like eagles soaring; they were three stars of  the Faith, pulsing with the light of the love of God.    Haji Hasan was of the earlier day; he had believed from the new Luminary's  first dawning. He was full of ardor, keen of mind. After"]]]
