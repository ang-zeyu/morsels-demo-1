Yet I  trust far more to your judgment than to my own. You approve of him, do you  not?\"    \"Entirely; yet, like yourself, am so loath to part with Violet that I  shall heartily rejoice if she declares herself indifferent to him.\"    \"I long to end my suspense in regard to that,\" Elsie said, \"but have  decided to endure it until the captain has spoken; because it seems better  and kinder not to embarrass her by any hint of the state of his feelings.\"    Her father expressed approval of her resolve, then as her children came  trooping in for their loved morning half hour with \"mamma,\" with their  bright faces and cheery greetings to her and grandpa, he left her and  went down to the parlor, where he found Capt. Raymond, and rejoiced his  heart with the favorable response to his request.    There was something so peculiar in the mother's gaze into Violet's face as  they exchanged their morning greetings, it was so unwontedly keen and  searching, half sad and anxious too, that the young girl asked in  surprise, \"What is it, mamma?\"    \"My darling, you are very sweet, very precious to your mother's heart!\"  Elsie said with an earnest, tender kiss; then turned quickly away to hide  the tell-tale moisture in her eyes.    Capt. Raymond was not long in finding or making his opportunity.    It was the day before Christmas, and Rosie and Walter made frequent  allusion to the exchange of gifts in which they expected to share that  evening. They were chatting with the captain about it, in the parlor, soon  after breakfast; talking of his children also; asking if he thought they  had received his presents by this time, and that they would have a tree.    Violet was sitting near, helping Rosie to dress some dolls for the little  cousins at the Laurels. Presently, one being quite ready, Rosie must run  and show it to mamma, and Walter went with her.    The door had scarcely closed on them, leaving Violet and the captain sole  occupants of the room, when he rose from his chair and, moving with some  care and difficulty, took another close at her side.    \"Are you not disobeying orders, sir, and in some danger of suffering for  it?\" she asked, looking at him with a mischievous smile.    \"No; I have the doctor's permission to try the ankle a little to-day,\" he  answered. Then, with a slightly embarrassed air, \"Miss Travilla,\" he said,  \"I should like to--would you accept a Christmas gift from me?\"    \"You are very kind, sir,\" she said, blushing vividly, \"but I think I must  decline. Mamma highly disapproves of young girls accepting presents from  their gentlemen friends.\"    \"But I have consulted her and your grandfather in regard to this, and  obtained their permission to offer it and ask for a return in kind. Will  you accept my hand (the heart you have already won) and give me yours in  exchange? Ah, I fear that you must think my presumption very great! I know  I am asking what a king might covet. I know that you, in your peerless  beauty--so fair, so sweet, so good, so talented, so admired and sought  after--are worthy of a throne, and I have not even wealth to offer  you--nothing, in fact, but the love of a man whose honor is unstained, and  who would cherish you as the apple of his eye. Ah, dearest girl, I have  no words to express the strength and power of the passionate affection  with which you have inspired me!\"    All this and much more in the same strain was poured out so rapidly and  ardently that Violet seemed overwhelmed by the torrent of words that had  come rushing upon her so unexpectedly and without any warning.    A deep blush overspread the fair face and neck, while her work fell from  her hand and her eyes sought the floor.    When at length he paused for a reply, she started up, saying confusedly,  in low, tremulous tones, \"I--I am far from meriting the praises you have  heaped upon me, and I am very young and foolish--not fit for--for so noble  and good a man--so worthy to be highly honored. And I--oh, how could I  leave my dear, widowed mother!\" Then, as approaching footsteps were heard  in the hall without, she turned and fled from the room.    \"Ah, grandpa's little cricket, what is it? what has disturbed you so?\"  asked a well-known voice, in tones that spoke more pleasure than alarm,  and Vi, as she hurried through the hall, half blinded by the tears in her  eyes, felt herself closely clasped by two strong arms that held her fast.    \"Oh, grandpa! I--I wish he hadn't!\" she stammered, dropping her face upon  his breast and bursting into tears.    \"Who, my pet? who has dared to ill use you?\" he asked, caressing her.    Vi lifted her head and looked up at him in surprise, for certainly his  tone was rather amused than angry or stern. Then at a sudden remembrance  of the captain's assertion that he had sought and obtained her  grandfather's permission to offer her his hand, \"Oh, grandpa, why did you  let him?\" she said, again hiding her blushing face on his breast; \"you  know I could never, never leave mamma! dear, dear mamma!\"    \"I am glad to hear it!\" he returned with satisfaction, repeating his  caresses, \"for I don't know what either she or I could do without you. And  that was your answer to Capt. Raymond?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Very well, go and tell mamma about it--she will be as glad as I am to  hear that we are not to lose our darling little Vi--while I see what I can  say to comfort the captain.\"    He released her as he spoke, and she flew to do his bidding.    Rosie and Walter were still with their mother in her boudoir, but as  Violet came in with her flushed, agitated face, they were gently bidden to  run away for a little while.    As the door closed on them, Violet dropped on her knees by her mother's  chair and laid her head in her lap, hiding her face.    \"My dear child! my dear, precious little daughter!\" Elsie said, softly  smoothing the golden tresses.    \"Mamma, you know?\"    \"Yes, dearest.\"    \"O mamma, I can't leave you! how could I?\"    \"Dear child! it would be a sore trial to have to part with you; and I  cannot be sorry that you are not ready or willing to go. You are one of  the very great blessings and comforts of your mother's life!\"    \"Dearest mother, thank you! They are very sweet words to hear from your  lips,\" Violet said, lifting her face to look up into her mother's with a  beautiful smile.    \"And so you have said your suitor nay?\" Elsie asked, with playful look and  tone.    \"I hardly know what I said, mamma, except that I was too young and foolish  and couldn't leave you!\"    \"You do not care for him at all?\"    \"I--I don't know, mamma!\" and the sweet, innocent face was suffused with  blushes; \"I had never thought of his fancying me--hardly more than a  child--while he--mamma, is he not very noble and good and wise? and so  brave and unselfish!--you know how he risked his life to save a poor old  negress; and how much he has suffered in consequence, and how patiently he  has borne it all!\"    \"And how handsome he is?\"    \"Yes, mamma, one reads the nobility of his nature in his face, and his  bearing is soldierly.\"    \"Ah, my little girl! my heart misgives me that I hold you by a very frail  tenure!\" Elsie sighed between a smile and a tear, as she bent her head to  look searchingly into the depths of the azure eyes.    Violet's face crimsoned, and her head went down again into her mother's  lap.    \"Mamma, you need not fear,\" she said, very low and tremulously, \"I have  rejected his offer, and I cannot leave you.\"    \"I am much mistaken if he is so easily repulsed,\" Elsie said. \"He is a  brave soldier, and will renew the assault nor raise the siege of my  daughter's heart until he has brought it to a full if not unconditional  surrender.\"    \"Mamma, I wish I could run away.\"    \"Come, then, to the Laurels with me, and you need not return until bedtime  to-night, unless you choose.\"    Vi's face brightened, then clouded again. \"Thank you, mamma, I will go,  yet it will be putting off the evil day for but a very little while.\"    \"It will give you time to think and analyze your own feelings, so that you  will be the better prepared for the next assault,\" was the playful  rejoinder. \"Go now, dear child, and make yourself ready. The carriage  will be at the door almost immediately--Arthur has consented to my taking  the children in a close carriage. They must return before sundown, but you  need not be in such haste.\"    Mr. Dinsmore did not find Capt. Raymond looking so completely cast down as  he had expected. His face was slightly flushed, his expression somewhat  perplexed and disappointed, but by no means despairing.    \"I fear I have been too precipitate,\" he said, in answer to his host's  inquiring look. \"'The more haste the less speed,' as the old proverb has  it. I fear I frightened the dear girl by too sudden and vehement an avowal  of my passion. Yet I trust it may not be too late to retrieve my error.\"    \"She rejected your suit?\" Mr. Dinsmore said interrogatively.    \"Yes, she seemed to do so!\" sighed the lover, \"yet the objections she  urged are not insurmountable. She calls herself too young and foolish, but  I hope to convince her that that is a mistake. Young she is indeed, but  very far from foolish. She cannot leave her mother is another objection,  but that I should not ask her to do--as a landlubber might,\" he added  sportively, \"would in all probability. As much of my life must be spent at  sea, it would not be worth while to set up a home of my own on land, if I  had a wife who preferred to live with her mother.\"    \"Well, sir, that is certainly much in your favor,\" said Mr. Dinsmore; \"our  greatest, almost our only objection to your suit being the thought of  parting with the child of our love.\"    When Violet came home that evening she did not rejoin the family in the  parlor, but went directly to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#19)"],[1,"around him, he remembered  that he was back home once more with his mother, Rollo, Bruno, and the  rest of the Hospice dogs, and that now he would have a chance to do the  work of his forefathers.    The soft, deep tones of the Hospice bell called them all to waken for a  new day and its work. The voices of the monks singing in the chapel  ceased, and at once all the dogs turned expectant eyes toward the  corridor, where Brother Antoine appeared with food for their breakfast.    They leaped around the monk, or mauled each other in play, while the hot  food was poured into a small trough, and soon Prince Jan was eating his  share with the rest of them. They all made way for him, and there was no  crowding, growling, or fighting over their morning meal.    When it was over the door leading into the yard was opened and the dogs  tumbled out, barking, jumping, knocking each other over, or scampering  full tilt in merry play. Rollo and his brother forgot they were grown-up  and frisked together as they had done in the days before Prince Jan had  been taken to the Land of No Snow.    Once more Brother Antoine stood on the steps watching them, and at last  he called Jan, who trotted obediently to him, and followed through the  arched corridors and the long hallway until they reached the three doors  that opened, one after the other, to the outside steps.    Jan saw the doctor and the captain already there. The old man was  mounted on the mule, Ketty, while Pierrot, the driver, waited beside it.  The doctor held a long, stout stick.    With a bark of welcome, the dog hurried to them and stood up on his hind  legs so he could lick the hand of the captain and feel its gentle touch  on his head.    Brother Antoine paused at the top step and watched, but he did not speak  as Pierrot called aloud and the mule started briskly down the trail  leading to Martigny. The doctor walked beside the mule, and then Jan  understood that they were leaving the Hospice.    He stopped and gazed back wistfully. The monk on the step gave no sign,  uttered no word to call him back. Sadly Jan turned and moved along the  trail behind the mule. The doctor and the captain, and even Pierrot,  looked at the dog, but none of them spoke to him.    For some little distance Jan trudged heavily, then he stopped suddenly  and twisted for a last look at his home. He saw the high-peaked roof and  the snow-clad mountains looming above it, then he turned again to follow  the travellers. They were now some distance ahead of him and a jagged  cliff hid them from his eyes. Jan did not move.    Through a gap he saw the captain, the doctor, and the guide. They halted  this time. They were waiting there for him.    The dog started quickly toward them, but something made him look again  where Brother Antoine stood on the steps. Jan hesitated, then he sat  down facing the trail toward Martigny. In a few minutes he saw the  little procession start on its way. He knew he could catch up with them  easily if he ran fast, but still he sat without moving, his eyes  fastened on that gap between the mountains.    He lifted his head and sent out the cry of his forefathers, so that the  echoes rang again and again. The answering voices died away, there was  no sound save the swish of melting snow that slipped down the steep  places, and then Prince Jan, St. Bernard, turned and trotted up the  trail to the home of his ancestors.    Brother Antoine waited on the top step. As the dog reached him, the monk  stooped and patted him, whispering softly, \"It is not easy, Prince Jan,  when the paths that Love and Duty travel lie far apart.\"    And so Prince Jan came back to the work of his ancestors, and as the  months passed by he saved many lives and was very happy. The young dogs  listened in respectful wonder when he told of the strange places and  things that he had found in the Land of No Snow. They learned from him  the lessons of obedience, loyalty, and kindliness.    \"If you do the very best you know how, it will always work out right in  the end,\" Jan ended each talk.    But sometimes at night as he slept among the other dogs, he saw the  captain walking about a room. Cheepsie was perched on the old man's  shoulder, while Hippity-Hop skipped beside them, and the dog-knew that  they were thinking of him.    Then Jan's ears cocked up, his tail swished gently on the stone floor of  the Hospice, for in his dreams he heard the faint sound of a quavering  voice singing:        \"Old dog Tray is ever faithful,      Grief cannot drive him away.        He's gentle and he's kind        And you'll never, never find      A better friend than old dog Tray.\"          Chapter XVII    JAN'S REWARD      Two years went past and Jan's work at the Hospice brought him great  happiness, for he knew that he was doing the work of his ancestors and  living a useful life.    Often as he travelled the snow trails, he remembered the Land of No  Snow, the warm sunshine, the fragrant flowers and the beautiful trees  laden with golden fruit. But the one thing for which his loyal heart  yearned most was the touch of a wrinkled hand on his head and the sound  of the old poundmaster's voice. No one knew Jan's thoughts, for he was  always eager to do his work the best he knew how, and to teach the  puppies to be proud of the privilege of helping people.    Brother Antoine had left the Hospice and gone down into the warmer  climate of the Valley of the Rhone. His work had been done bravely and  unselfishly, and the monks had asked that he be sent to a place where  sunshine and milder air would give him a chance to recover his strength  and prolong his life. Jan greatly missed this dear friend.    There were cold mornings when Prince Jan rose stiffly, for he had not  been hardened to the trail work from puppy days as Rollo and the other  dogs had been. Five years of warm sunshine in the Land of No Snow had  made Jan's muscles soft and flabby and he felt the cold weather more  than any of the other St. Bernards. Then, too, his long hair made the  work of the trails harder for him because the snow clung to his fur and  when it melted and soaked to his skin, the monks watched carefully to  keep him from becoming chilled. Once or twice he had limped badly after  coming in from his work, and then he had been rubbed and taken into the  Big Room and allowed to stretch before the fireplace, and for a while he  was not sent out with the other dogs.    One day during summer many of the dogs were given a chance to exercise  outdoors. Jan sat watching the youngsters tumble each other about, while  he recalled the times when he and Rollo had played that way and old  Bruno had sat watching them. Then one of the pups began barking, and  soon the others added their calls of welcome as a little party of  travellers appeared in the opening of the mountain pass toward Martigny.  Jan, mindful of his responsibility, joined in the calls. His deep,  mellow tones sounded distinctly above the others, but he did not know  that those on the trail had stopped while an old man, mounted on a mule,  cried out, \"Listen! That is Jan! I know his voice!\"    A younger man and a young woman who were also mounted on mules, laughed  happily, though the woman's eyes were filled with tears as she looked at  the old man. Then they hurried on and soon were in plain sight of the  steps that led into the Hospice. In a few more minutes the mules stopped  and the dogs crowded about to show how glad they were to have visitors.    The old man climbed down from his mule and turned to face the dogs. He  looked quickly from one to the other, until he found the one he sought.  Prince Jan started, his eyes lighted up suddenly, his head was lifted  high, then with a yelp of joy the big dog leaped forward.    \"Jan! Jan! You haven't forgotten me, have you?\" cried the old  poundmaster, kneeling down and putting his arms about the shaggy neck,  while the dog's rough tongue licked the wrinkled hand, and little  whimpers of delight told of Jan's happiness.    The other dogs crowded around in excitement, wondering what it all  meant, and the guide, with the lady and gentleman, now beside the old  man, kept talking together and patting Jan's head. But he did not think  of them as they moved to the door, for Jan's only thought was to keep  closely beside his dear old master whose hand rested on the furry head,  and whose kindly, faded blue eyes were filled with tears of joy. Jan's  eyes spoke his own happiness and love.    In the Big Room the monks received the old captain, whom they had not  forgotten, and after the first greetings were over, they listened to the  story of the poundmaster's homesickness for Jan. The lady, who was the  captain's daughter, explained that the mines in far-away Alaska had been  sold for enough money to build a home in Southern California, where the  captain lived with them. But it had not taken her very long to learn how  much her father wished to see Prince Jan once more. So the little  family had travelled back to Jan's home in the Alps.    That evening Jan was very happy as he stretched before the fireplace at  the captain's feet. He did not sleep, for his eyes were fixed on the old  man's face, and when the poundmaster reached down to touch Jan's head,  the dog's tail swished and thumped. Then Jan rose to his feet and laid  his head on the captain's knee, just as he used to do in the other days.    The monks talked very earnestly with the captain's daughter and her  husband, and at last they all sat down together, smiling at Jan. He did  not understand what they were saying but he knew they were very happy,  and he was happy with them.    What they had talked about was their plan for the dog. He was now past  eight years old and in a short time would not be able to go out on the  trail. Prince Jan had done his part in the work of the St. Bernards with  honor to himself and to them, and now that he was growing old, the monks  felt "]]]
