En-Noor asked to-day if, on entering Constantinople, we English made  presents. I told him very positively, \"No;\" but, on the contrary,  everything which the English demanded of the Sultan of the Turks he did  for us; and because the Sultan was weak, England was obliged to protect  him against the encroachments of the other Christian nations.    I was much surprised to hear to-day that En-Noor begged a black burnouse  from Barth. The old Sheikh is a Tuarick every inch of him. Nevertheless,  it is too bad to beg the things which we wear to protect us from the  cold and the heat. Barth, I believe, has not yet made the Sheikh a  present, and he is coming Hateetah over my worthy friend. Overweg has  given the Sheikh a cloth jacket, which he could ill spare. I feel most  determinedly disposed to give nothing more; but in justice I have to  add, that his highness sends regularly the milk in the morning, that he  gave me a piece of gour-nut on the road, and that he sent me a few dates  at my request! These are great things for Tuaricks; so, \"patience.\"    _16th._--I rose at daylight; the cold was moderate, morning foggy as  yesterday. People say we shall be only nine days from this going to  Damerghou, but I will give them twelve. All the old men in this country  apply to the Taleb for medicine to restore their powers. They very  unwillingly relinquish the exercise of the functions which give them  most delight; but nature is stronger than all things, and they must  submit to its inevitable course. In a country like Africa, where woman  is only thought of for one purpose, it chagrins these old fellows to see  all their nice plump slave-girls about them, and to find themselves past  and gone, so far as this state of existence is concerned. En-Noor and  Hateetah both made this kind of application to the Taleb. When I was  alone in my former journey in the desert, I had also the same kind of  experience.    We came two hours to-day to the well of Anfesas, before the mountain of  Baghzem. Our course was through valleys and rocks, as yesterday, and,  indeed, always in this country; for there is very little variation in  the landscape. Baghzem, instead of being the high mountain pictured to  me by the Ghadamsee merchants, is, at this view of it, only a low range.  Two little things observed to-day were, first, a \"traveller's sharpening  stone,\" on which every person passing by sharpened his dagger or his  sword: next, were heaps of sand scraped together, and sticks or stalks  of herbage stuck on the top, as frail marks of the route, corresponding  to the heaps of stone which mark in line the routes of the Sahara. There  was also a mosque formed of boughs of trees; that is, a low wall of the  groundplan of a mosque made of boughs of trees, like the walls of stone  in other places. The trees were as before, always those full of thorns,  like the tholukh; many of the species bearing what is called the date of  this country. No animals of game were seen, except a solitary hare; but  there were marks of the foot of the mohur, or large gazelle.    The lading of the camels in the morning takes always an hour and a-half:  we have few people, compared with the number of beasts of burden.    However, under the leadership of En-Noor, who has now decked himself in  a fine yellow burnouse, a sort of ensign of authority, the caravan  marches in great order and tranquillity.    The inhabitants of Damerghou are said to be a mixture of Kohlans and  Tuaricks; the latter, however, receding into the interior. But if the  Tuaricks have dispossessed the Kohlans, they have almost become Kohlans  themselves, forgetting their own language and their own customs and  manners. This would naturally result from their habit of taking female  slaves from Soudan. Women, of course, always teach their children their  own language. In this way the population becomes in a few years  amalgamated, the blacks with Tuaricks.    _17th._--We stopped here all day, occupied with Bornouese. The place is  pleasant enough, there being a good well of water. A little temporary  village stands near, composed of the women and children belonging to the  salt-caravan.    _18th._--We halted again another day. After this rest of three days for  the camels, we are to go on quicker. Overweg paid a visit to the  temporary village, principally to see the women, taking with him the  Malem Ibrahim. He was pleasantly received, and notes the fact as the  first specimen of Soudan hospitality. I also made an excursion of an  hour to a neighbouring eminence, where I had a view from the top of a  quartz rock of the surrounding landscape of stony hills and valleys. On  the east and west were ranges and groups of mountains; on the north-east  and towards Bilma, and on the south-west round the mountain of Baghzem,  the country appeared open. North and south were rocks. In the direction  of our route (south-east) the rocks seem scattered and at wide  distances, so I expect we shall soon bid farewell to the mountains of  Aheer. The celebrated mount of Baghzem is a mighty mass of rock, not  high, but apparently of immense breadth. The town of Baghzem is on the  western side, and out of our route.    I had a little clandestine transaction with Madame En-Noor to-day. She  sent me cheese and milk, and I sent her a ring. The slaves brought the  cheese stealthily: so, I suppose, the Sultan was not to know of it. But  they say that all the goats belong to the women, and, consequently, the  milk and cheese; but the camels to the men; some women, however, have  camels. There is a sort of division of male and female property in this  country.          CHAPTER VIII.

Our course  still towards that immense block of mountain, the celebrated Baghzem. We  are now encamped along its side. We crossed a large wady with  ancient-looking trees, having antiquity, in fact, stamped on their  trunks, all of the tholukh species. The sand of this desert is covered  with the footsteps or marks of the gazelle and hare; but we saw only one  gazelle and one hare. The gazelle was followed by a stupid mongrel-bred  dog; it jumped high in the air, and was soon out of sight. The Kailouees  are no huntsmen. I question whether they have ever caught a gazelle or  any full-grown animal in their lives; they are a stupid set, and their  dogs worse still in field-sport, though always living in the desert.  There are huntsmen amongst the Haghars. The Kailouees prefer running  down men, or rather women. All they think of is riding or straying from  place to place after the women--this is their sport.    This may be called a country of dry wadys. The name is appropriate all  the year round, except on the few days when the floods are seen pouring  down these seeming beds of rivers. Hereabouts are the largest tholukh  and other trees found in Aheer. Those that grow on high ground are  small, but from their trunks are picked off, by the slaves, pieces of  gum. To-day, however, I could not succeed in getting a piece. What was  found was carried to En-Noor. I shall soon get a taste of it. We  continue with our same number of camels; no other detachments of the  large salt-caravan have yet joined us. En-Noor is still very active,  riding before and behind, seeing that all is right. He is followed by  his shadow. He wears his yellow burnouse. I have heard of no town on  this side of Baghzem.    An immense quantity of stone is scattered over the route hereabouts.  Overweg believes it to be basalt, or a species of volcanic stone of  similar character.    I am preparing myself for my Soudan journeys, and, _en route_, take as  much rest as possible. Cold winds prevail night and morning, but the sun  burns a few hours in the day. Certainly now is the best season for  travelling in this country. What it is in Soudan it is impossible to  tell.    _20th._--We rested to-day. There is a well a short distance off, called  Tilya. This morning early filed by a large division of the salt-caravan,  about three hundred camels. We passed them yesterday. They had also a  little merchandise besides salt. Some of the people inquired of me if I  had found my camels. I told them two were still missing. They were all  strangers, but were, nevertheless, civil. I made a short excursion in  search of gum amongst the tholukh-trees. I was fortunate enough to find  one piece, or, rather, a small bunch of pellucid drops, of a bright  amber-colour. The bunch was scarcely exuding from the tree on which it  was found, and was ready to drop when touched, hanging by the slenderest  connexion. It was even somewhat disposed to become liquid. This gum is  found only on the small young trees. The taste was very pleasant. It is  astonishing how little gum has been picked off these trees by our  people, although we have passed tens of thousands of them _en route_.    The slaves of the caravan were having a game amongst themselves this  morning. They brought into my tent a man bound as dead, and I was  obliged to pay a handkerchief to relieve myself of the bad omen. Such a  thing is considered a horrible thing if you do not buy away the ill  effects of it. This is certainly an easy way of collecting money and  goods. It was, however,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#19)"],[1,"elssohn, written three weeks later, he  recants: \"I must take back much of what I wrote regarding  'Tannhaeuser,' after reading the score; on the stage the effect is  quite different. I was deeply moved by many parts.\" And to Heinrich  Dorn he writes, a few weeks after this: \"I wish you could see Wagner's  'Tannhaeuser.' It contains profound and original ideas, and is a  hundred times better than his previous operas, though some of the  music is trivial. In a word, he may become of great importance to the  stage, and, so far as I know him, he has the requisite courage. The  technical part, the instrumentation, I find excellent, incomparably  more masterly than formerly.\"    Nevertheless, seven years later still, he once more returns to the  attack, and declares that Wagner's music, \"apart from the performance,  is simply amateurish, void of contents, and disagreeable; and it is a  sad proof of corrupt taste that, in the face of the many dramatic  master-works which Germany has produced, some persons have the  presumption to belittle these in favor of Wagner's. Yet enough of  this. The future will pronounce judgment in this matter, too.\" Poor  Schumann! His own opera, \"Genoveva,\" was a failure, while \"Tannhaeuser\"  and \"Lohengrin\" were everywhere received with enthusiasm. This was a  quarter of a century ago; and the future _has_ judged, \"Tannhaeuser\"  and \"Lohengrin\" being now the most popular of all works in the  operatic repertory.    What caused the failure of Schumann's only opera was not a lack of  dramatic genius, but of theatrical instinct. He believed that in  \"Genoveva\" \"every bar is thoroughly dramatic;\" and so it is, as might  have been expected of the composer of such an intensely emotional and  passionate song as \"Ich grolle nicht\" and many others. But Schubert,  too, could write such thrilling five-minute dramas as the \"Erlking\"  and the \"Doppelgaenger,\" without being able to compose a successful  opera. Like Schumann, he could not paint _al fresco_, could not  command that bolder and broader sweep which is required of an operatic  composer. It is characteristic of Schumann that he did not write an  opera till late in life, whereas born operatic composers have commonly  begun their career with their specialty. Indeed, it was only ten years  before he composed his opera that Schumann wrote to a friend: \"You  ought to write more for the voice. Or are you, perhaps, like myself,  who have all my life placed vocal music below instrumental, and never  considered it a great art? But don't speak to anyone about this.\"  Oddly enough, less than a year after this he writes to another friend:  \"At present I write only vocal pieces.... I can hardly tell you what a  delight it is to write for the voice as compared with instruments, and  how it throbs and rages within me when I am at work. Entirely new  things have been revealed to me, and I am thinking of writing an  opera, which, however, will not be possible until I have entirely  freed myself from editorial work.\"    Like other vocal composers, Schumann suffered much from the lack of  suitable texts. In one letter he suggests that Lenau might perhaps be  induced to write a few poems for composers, to be printed in \"The  Zeitschrift:\" \"the composers are thirsting for texts.\" In several  other letters we become familiar with some of his plans which were  never executed, owing, apparently, to the shortcomings of the  librettists. One of these was R. Pohl, who in all earnestness sent  Schumann a serious text in which the moon was introduced as one of the  vocalists! Schumann mildly remonstrated that \"to conceive of the moon  as a person, especially as singing, would be too risky.\" So the  project of \"Ritter Mond\" was abandoned, and it is to be regretted that  Schumann did not reject his \"Genoveva\" libretto, which was largely  responsible for the failure of the opera.    One project of Schumann's is mentioned which it is to be very much  regretted he never carried out. \"I am at present [1840] preparing an  essay on Shakspere's relations to music, his utterances and views, the  manner in which he introduces music in his dramas, etc., etc.--an  exceedingly fertile and attractive theme, the execution of which  would, it is true, require some time, as I should have to read the  whole of Shakspere's works for this purpose.\" His object was to send  this to Jena as a dissertation for a Doctor's degree, with which he  hoped to soften the heart of the obdurate Wieck, who opposed his  marriage with Clara, and at the same time to make an impression on the  public. Schumann had had painful experience of the fact that for  genius itself there is little recognition in Germany unless it has a  handle to its name--a \"von\" or a \"Herr Doctor.\" Clara, however, loved  him for his genius, and for the impassioned pieces and songs he wrote  to express his admiration of her and of woman in general; and, like  other German men of genius, he had his reward--after death. \"No tone  poet,\" says Naumann, \"has been more enthusiastic in the praise of  woman than Robert Schumann; he was a second Frauenlob. This was  acknowledged by the maidens of Bonn, who, at his interment, filled the  cemetery, and crowned his tomb with innumerable garlands.\"          IV    MUSIC AND MORALS      Although music in the complex harmonic form known to us is only a few  centuries old, simple rhythmic melodies were sung, or played on  various instruments, by all the ancient civilized nations, and are  sung or played to-day by African and Australian savages who have never  come into contact with civilization. And what is more, the remarkable  influence which music has in arousing human emotions has been  appreciated at all times.    Tourists relate that in some of the inland countries of Africa,  scarcely any work is done by the natives except to the sound of music;  and Cruikshank, speaking of the coast negroes, says it is laughable to  observe the effect of their rude music on all classes, old and young,  men, women, and children. \"However employed, whether passing quietly  through the street, carrying water from the pond, or assisting in some  grave procession, no sooner do they hear the rapid beats of a distant  drum, than they begin to caper and dance spontaneously. The bricklayer  will throw down his trowel for a minute, the carpenter leave his  bench, the corn grinder her milling stone, and the porter his load, to  keep time to the inspiriting sound.\"    Dr. Tschudi, in his fascinating work on Peru, describes two of the  musical instruments used by the Indians, and their emotional function.  One is the Pututo, \"a large conch on which they perform mournful  music, as the accompaniment of their funeral dances.\" The other is  called Jaina, and is a rude kind of clarionet made from a reed. \"Its  tone,\" says Tschudi, \"is indescribable in its melancholy, and it  produces an extraordinary impression on the natives. If a group of  Indians are rioting and drinking, or engaged in furious conflicts with  each other, and the sound of the Jaina is suddenly heard, the tumult  ceases, as if by a stroke of magic. A dead stillness prevails, and all  listen devoutly to the magic tones of the simple reed; tones which  frequently draw tears from the eyes of the apathetic Indians.\"    If the untutored primitive man can be thus overpowered by the charm of  such simple music, we can hardly wonder at the extravagant power  ascribed to this art by the ancient civilized nations. The fairy tale  of Orpheus, who tamed wild animals and moved rocks and trees with his  singing and playing, and the story of the dolphin that was attracted  by Arion's song and carried him safely across the sea, are quite as  significant as if they were true stories, for they show that the  Greeks were so deeply moved by music that they could readily imagine  it to have a similar effect on animals, and even on inanimate objects.  Almost three thousand years ago, Homer represented Achilles as  \"comforting his heart with the sound of the lyre,\" after losing his  sweet Briseis; \"stimulating his courage and singing the deeds of the  heroes.\" And, as Emil Naumann fancies, there is a moral underlying the  myth of the siren; \"for, as Homer elsewhere suggests, noble and manly  music invigorates the spirit, strengthens wavering man, and incites  him to great and worthy deeds, whereas false and sensuous music  excites and confuses, robs man of his self-control, till his passions  overcome him as the waves overwhelmed the bewitched sailor who  listened to the voice of the charmer.\"    At a later period in Greek history, the philosophers, including Plato  and Aristotle, continued to attribute to music power so great, that we  can only understand them if we bear in mind that with the Greeks the  word music was a comprehensive term for all the arts presided over by  the Muses, and that, even when music in our sense is alluded to by  them, the reference is at the same time to the poetry which was almost  always associated with music, and made its meaning and expression more  definite. Thus, we can realize how Terpander could, by the power of  his song, reconcile the political factions in Sparta, and how Plato  could write, in the \"Republic,\" that \"any musical innovation is full  of danger to the state and ought to be prevented.\" He looked upon  music as a tonic which does for the mind what gymnastics do for the  body; and taught that only such music ought to be tolerated by the  state as had a moral purpose, while enervating forms should be  suppressed by the law makers.    Yet, after making due allowance for the fact that the word music was  used in this comprehensive sense, enough remains to show that the  power of music proper, the power of rhythmic melody, was profoundly  appreciated by the Greeks. If they had not felt how greatly music  intensifies and quickens the emotions, they would not have wedded all  their poetry to it, nor have resorted to it on all solemn and"]]]
