It may be asked how I know it was the guano, and not the chemical  manure. In answer to this inquiry, if made, I may observe, that I  supplied two of my neighbours with the chemical manure, and they  applied it without guano on very poor land, and they both assert  they had never such good crops of wheat before; but everywhere in  this neighbourhood, the only good samples of wheat that I saw or  heard of were grown on exhausted soil. This appears to me to be a  strong proof that chemistry has a great deal to learn before it  can adapt its measures to all varieties of seasons, particularly  as it cannot know beforehand how the season may turn out. If  further proof be required of the injurious effect upon grain crops  of ammoniacal manures in general, and of guano in particular, I  may mention that in another field of wheat, sowed on the 21st  December, and which did not come up until the frost broke, in  March (the previous crop having been Swedes), the blade was so  yellow and the plant altogether so small and sickly in appearance,  that I had it manured with a water-cart from a cesspool in April.  This appeared to produce a wonderful improvement immediately, as  the plant assumed a deep green and grew very fast, but when it  ought to have shot, the heads seemed to stick in the sockets, the  blade and straw became mildewed and made no progress in ripening.  It was not fit to cut for three weeks after the experimental  field, although it was an early white wheat, and the result was a  miserable crop--far worse than the experimental field. The  instance of injury from the use of guano, I had from a neighbour,  who told me he had sowed a patch of oats with it, and that they  never ripened at all, and that he was compelled to cut them green  as fodder for his cattle. I had a striking proof this season of  the much lower temperature required by oats than wheat, when  strongly stimulated by manuring. I had gathered an ear of wheat  and a panicle of oats the previous season, which seemed to me to  be superior varieties; and that they might have every chance, I  dibbled them alongside each other in my garden, and determined to  manure them with every kind of manure I could procure, as I had an  idea that it was not easy to over-manure grain crops, if all the  elements entering into the composition of the plant were applied  in due proportion to each other, and I also wished to ascertain  whether wheat and oats would thrive equally well with the same  sort of manuring. I accordingly limed the land soon after the  wheat came up, and in March I applied silicate of soda, sulphate  of magnesia, gypsum, common salt, and nitrate of soda. A fortnight  after this I applied guano, then bones dissolved in sulphuric  acid, then woollen rags dissolved in potash (the two latter in  weak solution); and the consequence was, that I don't think there  was a single grain in the whole parcel--at least I could not find  one--the straw was no great length, and the blade much discolored  with mildew, whilst the oats were seven feet high, and with straws  through which I could blow a  pea, and large panicles, although  the oat was not particularly well-fed. The inference I have drawn  from these experiments is, that as far as is practicable the  manuring should be adapted to the temperature, but as this is  obviously impossible in a climate like ours, the only way is to  rather under than over manure, and to apply no ammoniacal manure  to the wheat crop, or at all events very little; for although  guano was beneficial to wheat when used in conjunction with  silicates, &c. &c. in 1844, yet the injury it did in 1845 may very  fairly be set against that benefit. I should feel obliged if any  of your readers who may have tried the experiment of manuring  grain crops with guano, the last season (1845) would publish the  result as compared with a similar crop without such manuring. I  feel convinced that such result would be against the use of guano  for wheat in 1845. I am the more confirmed in the opinion that  ammoniacal manures are unfavourable for wheat, by a series of  articles in the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" on the \"Geo-Agriculture of  Middlesex,\" in which the writer states that land in that county  which in Queen Elizabeth's time produced such good wheat that it  was reserved for her especial use, will now scarcely grow wheat at  all, and when that grain is sowed upon it, the straw is always  mildewed, and the sample very poor; and this is attributed--and no  doubt justly so--to the extensive use of London manure. My crop  was only 32 bushels to the acre of 60 lbs. to the bushel; last  year the crop, as I have said before, was 50 bushels of the same  weight.    * * * * *    _To the same._    CLITHEROE, _7th March_, 1848.    On continuing my attempts to grow wheat on the same land year  after year, I observed that the crop of 1845 was very seriously  injured by the deficient drainage--the old drains having been  destroyed by the subsoil plough. It was therefore necessary to  replace them: they were accordingly put in four feet deep. This  occupied so much time that the season for sowing wheat had gone  by, and the ground was cropped with potatoes, which were got up in  September, and the wheat might have been got in early in October.  But seeing in your paper that sowing too early was not advisable,  and also being carried away by the arguments of the thin-seeders,  I deferred sowing until the middle of November, and then put in  little seed; and the winter proving very unfavourable, when the  wheat was coming up, there was not half plant enough in the  spring, and I hesitated whether to plough up the ground or drill  in barley. I determined to do the latter, which was done on the  18th April, and wheat and barley grew up together, and when cut  and threshed, proved to be equal to 48 bushels to the acre.    * * * * *    LOW MOOR, _31st December_, 1844.    HENRY BRIGGS, ESQ.    I duly received your obliging letter in reply to my pamphlet on  the growth of wheat year after year on the same land, and now  offer my rejoinder to your remarks. You seem to consider the  expense is too great under the system pursued by me; and that it  was more than was required by the crop, is proved in my opinion by  the fact that the fertility of the land is very much augmented  since the commencement of the experiment in 1841: as my first crop  with guano alone produced only 27 bushels per acre, whilst this  year from guano alone the produce was 42 bushels. But still I  think that your allowance of manure is far too little, and not  exactly what I should apply, and I shall frankly state my  objections and opinions, in the hope that they may elicit a reply  from you, as it will be from discussion and the experiments  instituted to test the various theories propounded, that  agriculture will be most materially benefited. You state that  Liebig's present theory is, that plants obtain the necessary  oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen from the rain and  atmosphere, and that the plants merely require the supply of  inorganic constituents, and that you are inclined to agree with  him. My copy of his work on the Chemistry of Agriculture is his  first edition; and I don't know how far he has since modified or  altered the opinions therein expressed, which are in some degree  at variance with each other. He states that it may be received as  an axiom in agricultural chemistry that the nitrogen of the  atmosphere is never assimilated by plants, except in the form of  ammonia or nitric acid. He certainly states that plants and  animals derive their nitrogen from the atmosphere; but why, if  this be true, does he attach so much importance to the excrements  (particularly urine), of men and animals being husbanded with so  much care? and he states that for every pound of urine wasted, a  pound of wheat is thrown away. But even if he said it was utterly  worthless, every practical farmer who has tried it knows how  exceedingly valuable it is. It may be said there are other  ingredients in urine besides ammonia, and these are what make it  valuable; and in reply to this I would ask what is it that makes  the ammoniacal liquor from gasworks so valuable? There are no  phosphates or alkalies there, and yet what a powerful stimulant it  is. Again, Liebig states that the carbon is derived from the  atmosphere; but to say nothing of the argument which might be  deduced from the advantage which is derived by plants from having  their soil loosened about their roots, the experiments of Dumas  and Boussingault prove that a tree which was cut off below the  branches expired a large quantity of carbonic acid. It may be  asked how I know this was not precipitated by the rain. I don't  know; but if the plant would assimilate this, why should it not  assimilate that which arises from the decomposition of the  carbonaceous matter in the soil? My idea is that it does both, and  that carbon in the soil does good if it offers an abundant supply  of carbonic acid to the plant when it is in a condition to  appropriate it. Your allowance of lime appears to  me to be far  too small, for if any reliance can be placed on my experiments,  lime can be profitably used to far  greater extent than you seem  to imagine. And, again, you seem to think that where there is  plenty of silex in the soil, the plant will be able to obtain as  much as it requires. I think that it is quite necessary that the  silex should be  in a soluble state, as I think that it is not  only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#19)"],[1,"adjured, silently, involuntarily, I passed from the Veiled  Woman's side, over the sear lines on the turf which had been traced  by the triangles of light long since extinguished, and toward the  verge of the circle.  As I advanced, overhead rushed a dark cloud  of wings--birds dislodged from the forest on fire, and screaming,  in dissonant terror, as they flew toward the farthermost mountains;  close by my feet hissed and glided the snakes, driven forth from  their blazing coverts, and glancing through the ring, unscared by  its waning lamps; all undulating by me, bright-eyed, and hissing,  all made innocuous by fear--even the terrible Death-adder, which I  trampled on as I halted at the verge of the circle, did not turn to  bite, but crept harmless away.  I halted at the gap between the two  dead lamps, and bowed my head to look again into the crystal  vessel.  Were there, indeed, no lingering drops yet left, if but to  recruit the lamps for some priceless minutes more?  As I thus  stood, right into the gap between the two dead lamps strode a  gigantic Foot.  All the rest of the form was unseen; only, as  volume after volume of smoke poured on from the burning land  behind, it seemed as if one great column of vapor, eddying round,  settled itself aloft from the circle, and that out from that column  strode the giant Foot.  And, as strode the Foot, so with it came,  like the sound of its tread, a roll of muttered thunder.    I recoiled, with a cry that rang loud through the lurid air.    \"Courage!\" said the voice of Ayesha.  \"Trembling soul, yield not an  inch to the demon!\"    At the charm, the wonderful charm, in the tone of the Veiled  Woman's voice, my will seemed to take a force more sublime than its  own.  I folded my arms on my breast, and stood as if rooted to the  spot, confronting the column of smoke and the stride of the giant  Foot.  And the Foot halted, mute.    Again, in the momentary hush of that suspense, I heard a voice--it  was Margrave's.    \"The last hour expires--the work is accomplished!  Come! come!  Aid  me to take the caldron from the fire; and, quick!--or a drop may be  wasted in vapor--the Elixir of Life from the caldron!\"    At that cry I receded, and the Foot advanced.    And at that moment, suddenly, unawares, from behind, I was stricken  down.  Over me, as I lay, swept a whirlwind of trampling hoofs and  glancing horns.  The herds, in their flight from the burning  pastures, had rushed over the bed of the water course, scaled the  slopes of the banks.  Snorting and bellowing, they plunged their  blind way to the mountains.  One cry alone, more wild than their  own savage blare, pierced the reek through which the Brute  Hurricane swept.  At that cry of wrath and despair I struggled to  rise, again dashed to earth by the hoofs and the horns.  But was it  the dreamlike deceit of my reeling senses, or did I see that giant  Foot stride past through the close-serried ranks of the maddening  herds?  Did I hear, distinct through all the huge uproar of animal  terror, the roll of low thunder which followed the stride of that  Foot?      X      When my sense had recovered its shock, and my eyes looked dizzily  round, the charge of the beasts had swept by; and of all the wild  tribes which had invaded the magical circle, the only lingerer was  the brown Death-adder, coiled close by the spot where my head had  rested.  Beside the extinguished lamps which the hoofs had  confusedly scattered, the fire, arrested by the water course, had  consumed the grasses that fed it, and there the plains stretched  black and desert as the Phlegraean Field of the Poet's Hell.  But  the fire still raged in the forest beyond--white flames, soaring up  from the trunks of the tallest trees, and forming, through the  sullen dark of the smoke reck, innumerable pillars of fire, like  the halls in the city of fiends.    Gathering myself up, I turned my eyes from the terrible pomp of the  lurid forest, and looked fearfully down on the hoof-trampled sward  for my two companions.    I saw the dark image of Ayesha still seated, still bending, as I  had seen it last.  I saw a pale hand feebly grasping the rim of the  magical caldron, which lay, hurled down from its tripod by the rush  of the beasts, yards away from the dim, fading embers of the  scattered wood pyre.  I saw the faint writhings of a frail, wasted  frame, over which the Veiled Woman was bending.  I saw, as I moved  with bruised limbs to the place, close by the lips of the dying  magician, the flash of the rubylike essence spilled on the sward,  and, meteor-like, sparkling up from the torn tufts of herbage.    I now reached Margrave's side.  Bending over him as the Veiled  Woman bent, and as I sought gently to raise him, he turned his  face, fiercely faltering out, \"Touch me not, rob me not!  YOU share  with me!  Never, never!  These glorious drops are all mine!  Die  all else!  I will live, I will live!\"  Writhing himself from my  pitying arms, he plunged his face amidst the beautiful, playful  flame of the essence, as if to lap the elixir with lips scorched  away from its intolerable burning.  Suddenly, with a low shriek, he  fell back, his face upturned to mine, and on that face unmistakably  reigned Death.    Then Ayesha tenderly, silently, drew the young head to her lap, and  it vanished from my sight behind her black veil.    I knelt beside her, murmuring some trite words of comfort; but she  heeded me not, rocking herself to and fro as the mother who cradles  a child to sleep.  Soon the fast-flickering sparkles of the lost  elixir died out on the grass; and with their last sportive diamond-  like tremble of light, up, in all the suddenness of Australian day,  rose the sun, lifting himself royally above the mountain tops, and  fronting the meaner blaze of the forest as a young king fronts his  rebels.  And as there, where the bush fires had ravaged, all was a  desert, so there, where their fury had not spread, all was a  garden.  Afar, at the foot of the mountains, the fugitive herds  were grazing; the cranes, flocking back to the pools, renewed the  strange grace of their gambols; and the great kingfisher, whose  laugh, half in mirth, half in mockery, leads the choir that welcome  the morn--which in Europe is night--alighted bold on the roof of  the cavern, whose floors were still white with the bones of races,  extinct before--so helpless through instincts, so royal through  Soul--rose MAN!    But there, on the ground where the dazzling elixir had wasted its  virtues--there the herbage already had a freshness of verdure  which, amid the duller sward round it, was like an oasis of green  in a desert.  And, there, wild flowers, whose chill hues the eye  would have scarcely distinguished the day before, now glittered  forth in blooms of unfamiliar beauty.  Toward that spot were  attracted myriads of happy insects, whose hum of intense joy was  musically loud.  But the form of the life-seeking sorcerer lay  rigid and stark; blind to the bloom of the wild flowers, deaf to  the glee of the insects--one hand still resting heavily on the rim  of the emptied caldron, and the face still hid behind the Black  Veil.  What! the wondrous elixir, sought with such hope and well-  nigh achieved through such dread, fleeting back to the earth from  which its material was drawn to give bloom, indeed--but to herbs;  joy indeed--but to insects!    And now, in the flash of the sun, slowly wound up the slopes that  led to the circle, the same barbaric procession which had sunk into  the valley under the ray of the moon.  The armed men came first,  stalwart and tall, their vests brave with crimson and golden lace,  their weapons gayly gleaming with holiday silver.  After them, the  Black Litter.  As they came to the place, Ayesha, not raising her  head, spoke to them in her own Eastern tongue.  A wail was her  answer.  The armed men bounded forward, and the bearers left the  litter.    All gathered round the dead form with the face concealed under the  Black Veil; all knelt, and all wept.  Far in the distance, at the  foot of the blue mountains, a crowd of the savage natives had risen  up as if from the earth; they stood motionless leaning on their  clubs and spears, and looking toward the spot on which we were--  strangely thus brought into the landscape, as if they too, the wild  dwellers on the verge which Humanity guards from the Brute, were  among the mourners for the mysterious Child of mysterious Nature!  And still, in the herbage, hummed the small insects, and still,  from the cavern, laughed the great kingfisher.  I said to Ayesha,  \"Farewell! your love mourns the dead, mine calls me to the living.  You are now with your own people, they may console you--say if I  can assist.\"    \"There is no consolation for me!  What mourner can be consoled if  the dead die forever?  Nothing for him is left but a grave; that  grave shall be in the land where the song of Ayesha first lulled  him to sleep.  Thou assist ME--thou, the wise man of Europe!  From  me ask assistance.  What road wilt thou take to thy home?\"    \"There is but one road known to me through the maze of the  solitude--that which we took to this upland.\"    \"On that road Death lurks, and awaits thee!  Blind dupe, couldst  thou think that if the grand secret of life had been won, he whose  head rests on my lap would have yielded thee one petty drop of the  essence which had filched from his store of life but a moment?  Me,  who so loved and so cherished him--me he would have doomed to the  pitiless cord of my servant, the Strangler, if my death could have  lengthened a hairbreadth the span of his being.  But what matters  to me his crime or his madness?  I loved him, I loved him!\"    She bowed her veiled head lower and lower; perhaps under the veil  her lips kissed the lips of the dead.  Then she said whisperingly:    \"Juma the Strangler, whose word never failed to his master, whose  prey never slipped from"]]]
