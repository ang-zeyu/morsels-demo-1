On this occasion I was witness to one of the finest gun shots which  ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill.  A large bird of great breadth  of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us.  Captain Nemo's  companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards  above the waves.  The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall  brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter's grasp.  It was an  albatross of the finest kind.    Our march had not been interrupted by this incident.  For two hours we  followed these sandy plains, then fields of algae very disagreeable to  cross.  Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a glimmer of light,  which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters.  It was the  lantern of the Nautilus.  Before twenty minutes were over we should be  on board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that  my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen.  But I did not  reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time.    I had remained some steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemo  coming hurriedly towards me.  With his strong hand he bent me to the  ground, his companion doing the same to Conseil.  At first I knew not  what to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeing  the Captain lie down beside me, and remain immovable.    I was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush of  algae, when, raising my head, I saw some enormous mass, casting  phosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by.    My blood froze in my veins as I recognised two formidable sharks which  threatened us.  It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with  enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter  ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle.  Monstrous brutes! which  would crush a whole man in their iron jaws.  I did not know whether  Conseil stopped to classify them; for my part, I noticed their silver  bellies, and their huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a very  unscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as a  naturalist.    Happily the voracious creatures do not see well.  They passed without  seeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we escaped by a  miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face  in the forest.  Half an hour after, guided by the electric light we  reached the Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain  Nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell.  He then  pressed a knob.  I heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel,  I felt the water sinking from around me, and in a few moments the cell  was entirely empty.  The inside door then opened, and we entered the  vestry.    There our diving-dress was taken off, not without some trouble, and,  fairly worn out from want of food and sleep, I returned to my room, in  great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea.        CHAPTER XVII    FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC    The next morning, the 18th of November, I had quite recovered from my  fatigues of the day before, and I went up on to the platform, just as  the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase.    I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo  appeared.  He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a  series of astronomical observations.  Then, when he had finished, he  went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly  on the ocean.  In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the  Nautilus, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.  They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night.  These  sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type  was visible in all of them.  I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen,  Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote.  They were civil,  and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I  could not guess, neither could I question them.    The nets were hauled in.  They were a large kind of \"chaluts,\" like  those on the Normandy coasts, great pockets that the waves and a chain  fixed in the smaller meshes kept open.  These pockets, drawn by iron  poles, swept through the water, and gathered in everything in their  way.  That day they brought up curious specimens from those productive  coasts.    I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of  fish.  It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at.  Indeed, the nets  are let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinite  variety.  We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the  Nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew  our supply.  These several productions of the sea were immediately  lowered through the panel to the steward's room, some to be eaten  fresh, and others pickled.    The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, I thought that the  Nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion, and was  preparing to return to my room, when, without further preamble, the  Captain turned to me, saying:    \"Professor, is not this ocean gifted with real life?  It has its  tempers and its gentle moods.  Yesterday it slept as we did, and now it  has woke after a quiet night.  Look!\" he continued, \"it wakes under the  caresses of the sun.  It is going to renew its diurnal existence.  It  is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation.  It has  a pulse, arteries, spasms; and I agree with the learned Maury, who  discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in  animals.    \"Yes, the ocean has indeed circulation, and to promote it, the Creator  has caused things to multiply in it--caloric, salt, and animalculae.\"    When Captain Nemo spoke thus, he seemed altogether changed, and aroused  an extraordinary emotion in me.    \"Also,\" he added, \"true existence is there; and I can imagine the  foundations of nautical towns, clusters of submarine houses, which,  like the Nautilus, would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface  of the water, free towns, independent cities.  Yet who knows whether  some despot----\"    Captain Nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture.  Then,  addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought:    \"M. Aronnax,\" he asked, \"do you know the depth of the ocean?\"    \"I only know, Captain, what the principal soundings have taught us.\"    \"Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?\"    \"These are some,\" I replied, \"that I remember.  If I am not mistaken, a  depth of 8,000 yards has been found in the North Atlantic, and 2,500  yards in the Mediterranean.  The most remarkable soundings have been  made in the South Atlantic, near the thirty-fifth parallel, and they  gave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, and 15,000 yards.  To sum up all, it  is reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled, its mean depth  would be about one and three-quarter leagues.\"    \"Well, Professor,\" replied the Captain, \"we shall show you better than  that I hope.  As to the mean depth of this part of the Pacific, I tell  you it is only 4,000 yards.\"    Having said this, Captain Nemo went towards the panel, and disappeared  down the ladder.  I followed him, and went into the large drawing-room.  The screw was immediately put in motion, and the log gave twenty miles  an hour.    During the days and weeks that passed, Captain Nemo was very sparing of  his visits.  I seldom saw him.  The lieutenant pricked the ship's  course regularly on the chart, so I could always tell exactly the route  of the Nautilus.    Nearly every day, for some time, the panels of the drawing-room were  opened, and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the  submarine world.    The general direction of the Nautilus was south-east, and it kept  between 100 and 150 yards of depth.  One day, however, I do not know  why, being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes, it touched  the bed of the sea.  The thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25  (cent.): a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all  latitudes.    At three o'clock in the morning of the 26th of November the Nautilus  crossed the tropic of Cancer at 172 deg. long.  On 27th instant it  sighted the Sandwich Islands, where Cook died, February 14, 1779.  We  had then gone 4,860 leagues from our starting-point. In the morning,  when I went on the platform, I saw two miles to windward, Hawaii, the  largest of the seven islands that form the group.  I saw clearly the  cultivated ranges, and the several mountain-chains that run parallel  with the side, and the volcanoes that overtop Mouna-Rea, which rise  5,000 yards above the level of the sea.  Besides other things the nets  brought up, were several flabellariae and graceful polypi, that are  peculiar to that part of the ocean.  The direction of the Nautilus was  still to the south-east. It crossed the equator December 1, in 142 deg.  long.; and on the 4th of the same month, after crossing rapidly and  without anything in particular occurring, we sighted the Marquesas  group.  I saw, three miles off, Martin's peak in Nouka-Hiva, the  largest of the group that belongs to France.  I only saw the woody  mountains against the horizon, because Captain Nemo did not wish to  bring the ship to the wind.  There the nets brought up beautiful  specimens of fish:  some with azure fins and tails like gold, the flesh  of which is unrivalled; some nearly destitute of scales, but of  exquisite flavour; others, with bony jaws, and yellow-tinged gills, as  good as bonitos; all fish that would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#19)"],[1,"  The Individual in the Animal Kingdom.
