Polly, his head was under water  all the time, unless some of the boys tugged him along every day. We  hardly got him home at all.\"    \"No such thing,\" contradicted Percy flatly, his face growing red.  \"Polly, he tells perfectly awful yarns. You mustn't believe him, Polly,  You won't, will you?\" He leaned over appealingly toward her.    \"Oh! don't, don't,\" cried Polly, quite dismayed, \"talk so to each  other.\"    \"Well, he's so hateful,\" cried Van, \"and the airs he gives himself! I  can't stand them, Polly, you know\"--    \"And he's just as mean,\" cried Percy vindictively. \"Oh! you can't  think, Polly. Here we are,\" as Thomas gave a grand flourish through the  stone gateway, and up to the steps.    \"I'll help you out,\" and he sprang out first.    \"No, I will,\" declared Van, opening the door on the other side, jumping  out and running around the carriage. \"Here, Polly, take my hand, do.\"    \"No, I got here first,\" said Percy eagerly, his brown glove extended  quite beyond Van's hand.    \"I don't want any one to help me, who speaks so to his brother,\" said  Polly in a low voice, and with her most superb air stepping down alone,  she ran up the steps to leave them staring in each other's faces.    Here everybody came hurrying out to the porch, and they were soon drawn  into the warm loving welcome awaiting them.    \"Oh, Felicie! I don't want that dress,\" said Polly as she ran into her  room after dinner, to Mrs. Whitney's French maid, \"I'm going to wear my  brown cashmere.\"    \"Oh, Mademoiselle!\" remonstrated Felicie, adjusting the ruffle in the  neck of the white nun's veiling over her arm.    \"Oh, no, Polly! I wouldn't,\" began Mrs. Pepper, coming in, \"the white  one is better for to-night.\"    \"Mamsie!\" cried Polly, breaking away from the mirror where she was  pulling into place the bright brown waves over her forehead, \"how  lovely! you've put on your black silk; and your hair is just beautiful!\"    \"Madame has ze fine hair,\" said Felicie, \"only I wish zee would gif it  to me to prepaire.\"    \"Yes, I have good hair,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"and I'm thankful for it. No  one looks dressed up, in my opinion, with a ragged head. The finer the  gown, the worse it makes careless hair look. No, Polly, I wouldn't wear  the brown dress to-night.\"    \"Why, Mamsie!\" exclaimed Polly in surprise, \"I thought you'd say it was  just the thing when only the girls and Jappy's friends are coming to  the play. Besides, I don't want to look too dressed up; the Princess  ought to be the only one in a white gown.\"    \"You won't be too conspicuous,\" said her mother; adding slowly, \"you  might wear the nun's veiling well enough as you haven't any part in the  play, Polly,\" and she scanned the rosy face keenly.    \"I don't want any part,\" cried Polly; \"they all play better than I do.  Somebody must see that everything goes off well behind the scenes;  that's my place, Mamsie. Besides, you forget I am to play my sonata.\"    \"I don't forget,\" said her mother; \"all the more reason you should wear  the white gown, then.\"    \"All right,\" cried Polly, merrily dashing across the room to Felicie,  \"put it over my head, do. Well, I'm glad you think it is right to wear  it, Mamsie,\" as the soft folds fell around her. \"I just love this  dress. Oh, Auntie! how perfectly exquisite!\"    Mrs. Whitney came in smilingly and put a kiss on the tall girl's cheek.  \"Do I look nicely?\" she asked naively, turning around under the  chandelier.    \"Nicely?\" exclaimed Polly, lifting her hands, \"why you are fresh from  fairyland. You are so good to put on that lovely blue moire and your  diamond cross, just for the boys and girls.\"    \"I am glad you like it,\" said Mrs. Whitney hastily. \"Now, Polly, don't  you worry about anything; I'll see that the last things are done.\"    \"Well, I am worrying,\" confessed Polly, quite in a tremble; \"I must see  to one corner of the private box for the boys. You know the last India  shawl you lent me wasn't pinned up straight and I couldn't fix it, for  Van wanted me just then, and I couldn't get away without his suspecting  something. Oh, Auntie! if you would see to that.\"    \"I will,\" said Mrs. Whitney, not daring to look at Mrs. Pepper, \"and to  all the other things; don't give a thought to them, Polly.\"    \"How good you are,\" cried Polly with a sigh of relief. \"Oh, Auntie! we  couldn't do anything without you.\"    \"And you don't need to go into the drawing-room at all,\" said Mrs.  Whitney, going to the door. \"Just keep behind the scenes, and get your  actors and Phronsie ready, and your mother and I will receive your  friends. Come, Mrs. Pepper.\"    \"That is splendid,\" cried Polly, left behind with the maid, \"now I can  get ready without flying into a flurry, Felicie; and then for Phronsie  and the rest!\"    \"There is a dreadful commotion in there among the audience,\" said  Jasper, out in the green room; \"I imagine every one who had an  'invite,' has come. But I don't see how they can make such a noise.\"    \"Oh! a few girls and boys make just about as much confusion as a good  many,\" observed Polly. \"Jasper, wouldn't you like to see Joel's eyes  when Aunt Whitney leads him into the private box?\" she allowed herself  time to exclaim. \"Yes,\" laughed Jasper, pulling out his watch from  beneath his dragon-skin; \"well, we have only five minutes more, Polly.  We must have the curtain up sharp.\"    \"O dear, dear!\" cried Polly, flying here and there to bestow last  touches on the different members of her cast. \"Now, Clare, you must  remember not to give such a shriek when you go on, mustn't he, Jappy?  Just a dull, sullen roar, your part is.\"    \"Well, I'm nearly dead under here,\" cried Clare, glaring beneath his  dragon face. \"I'll shriek, or roar, just as I like, so!\"    \"Very well,\" said Polly, \"I don't know but it's as well, after all,  that you are cross; you'll be more effective,\" she added coolly. \"Let  me see--oh! the door of the cave wants a bit more of gray moss; it  looks thin where it hangs over. You get it, will you, Hannah?\" to one  of the maids who was helping.    \"And just one thing more,\" scanning hastily the stage setting, \"another  Chinese lantern is needed right here,\" going toward the front of the  stage, \"and that green bush is tumbling over; do set it straight,  somebody; there now, I believe everything is all ready. Now let us peep  out of the curtain, and get one good look at the audience. Come,  Phronsie, here's a fine place; come, boys!\"    The different members of the cast now applied their eyes to as many  cracks in the curtain as could be hastily managed.    There was a breathing space.    \"What, what?\" cried Polly, gazing into the sea of faces, and the  dragons nearly knocked the Princess over as Mr. King gave the signal  for the band stationed in the wide hall, to send out their merriest  strains.          V    AFTER THE PLAY      It was all over. Phronsie had been swept off, a vision of loveliness,  to the cave; the dragons had roared their loudest, and the gallant  knight had covered himself with glory in the brilliant rescue of the  Princess; the little page had won the hearts of all the ladies; Mr.  King had applauded himself hoarse, especially during the delivery of  the prologue, when \"I cry you mercy, sirs, and ladies fair,\" rang out;  the musical efforts of Polly and Jasper in the \"Wait\" between the two  acts were over, and the crowded house, in every way possible, had  expressed itself delighted with all things from beginning to end.    \"Phronsie, Phronsie, they're calling you,\" whispered Polly excitedly,  out in the green room.    \"Come, Princess.\" The head dragon held out his hand. \"Hurry dear! See  the flowers!\"    \"They can't be for me,\" said Phronsie, standing quite still; \"Polly has  done all the work; they're hers.\"    \"Nonsense, child!\" cried Polly, giving her a gentle push forward. \"Go  on, and take them.\"    \"Polly, you come too,\" begged Phronsie, refusing to stir, and holding  her by the gown.    \"I can't, Phronsie,\" cried Polly in distress; \"don't you see they  haven't called me. Go on, child, if you love me,\" she implored.    Phronsie, not being able to resist this, dropped Polly's gown and  floated before the footlights.    \"Thank you,\" she said, bowing gravely to the sea of faces, as her hands  were filled with roses, \"but I shall give these to Polly, because we  couldn't any of us have done it without her.\" And so she brought them  back to put into dismayed Polly's lap.    \"The authors--the authors of the play!\" cried a strong voice, privately  urged on by Mr. King.    \"There, now's your turn,\" cried Clare to Polly. \"And go ahead, old  dragon,\" to Jasper, \"make your prettiest bow.\"    So the chief dragon led up blushing Polly to the front of the stage, to  hear a neat little speech from Mr. Alstyne, thanking them for the  pleasure of the evening and congratulating them on its success; and the  band played again, the camp chairs were folded up and removed, the  green-room and stage were deserted, and actors and audience mingled in  a gay, confusing throng.    Phronsie, in her little silver and white gown and gleaming cap, began  to wander among the guests, unconscious that she had not on the red  cashmere dress she had worn all day. Groups stopped their conversation  to take her into their midst, passing her on at last as one might hand  over a precious parcel to the next waiting hands.

I do not rashly take them about the necke,  I doe but touch them, nor doe I go so far as by my bargaine I would  seeme to doe; could I but keepe even with them, I should then be an  honest man; for I seeke not to venture on them, but where they are  strongest. To doe as I have seen some, that is, to shroud themselves  under other armes, not daring so much as to show their fingers ends  unarmed, and to botch up all their works (as it is an easie matter  in a common subject, namely for the wiser sort) with ancient  inventions, here and there hudled up together. And in those who  endeavoured to hide what they have filched from others, and make it  their owne, it is first a manifest note of injustice, then a plaine  argument of cowardlinesse; who having nothing of any worth in  themselves to make show of, will yet under the countenance of others  sufficiencie goe about to make a faire offer: Moreover (oh great  foolishnesse) to seek by such cosening [Footnote: Cheating.] tricks  to forestall the ignorant approbation of the common sort, nothing  fearing to discover their ignorance to men of understanding (whose  praise only is of value) who will soone trace out such borrowed  ware. As for me, there is nothing I will doe lesse. I never speake  of others, but that I may the more speake of my selfe. This  concerneth not those mingle-mangles of many kinds of stuffe, or as  the Grecians call them Rapsodies, that for such are published, of  which kind I have (since I came to yeares of discretion) seen divers  most ingenious and wittie; amongst others, one under the name of  Capilupus; besides many of the ancient stampe. These are wits of  such excellence, as both here and elsewhere they will soone be  perceived, as our late famous writer Lipsius, in his learned and  laborious work of the Politikes: yet whatsoever come of it, for so  much as they are but follies, my intent is not to smother them, no  more than a bald and hoarie picture of mine, where a Painter hath  drawne not a perfect visage, but mine owne. For, howsoever, these  are but my humors and opinions, and I deliver them but to show what  my conceit [Footnote: notion] is, and not what ought to be beleeved.  Wherein I ayme at nothing but to display my selfe, who peradventure  (if a new prentiship change me) shall be another to morrow. I have  no authoritie to purchase beliefe, neither do I desire it; knowing  well that I am not sufficiently taught to instruct others. Some  having read my precedent Chapter [Footnote: \"Of Pedantism\"], told me  not long since in mine owne house, I should somewhat more have  extended my selfe in the discourse concerning the institution of  children. Now (Madam) if there were any sufficiencie in me touching  that subject, I could not better employ the same than to bestow it  as a present upon that little lad, which ere long threatneth to make  a happie issue from out your honorable woombe; for (Madame) you are  too generous to begin with other than a man childe. And having had  so great a part in the conduct of your successeful marriage, I may  challenge some right and interest in the greatnesse and prosperitie  of all that shall proceed from it: moreover, the ancient and  rightfull possession, which you from time to time have ever had, and  still have over my service, urgeth me with more than ordinarie  respects, to wish all honour, well-fare and advantage to whatsoever  may in any sort concerne you and yours. And truly, my meaning is but  to show that the greatest difficultie, and importing all humane  knowledge, seemeth to be in this point, where the nurture and  institution of young children is in question. For, as in matters of  husbandrie, the labor that must be used before sowing, setting, and  planting, yea in planting itselfe, is most certaine and easie. But  when that which was sowen, set and planted, commeth to take life;  before it come to ripenesse, much adoe, and great varietie of  proceeding belongeth to it. So in men, it is no great matter to get  them, but being borne, what continuall cares, what diligent  attendance, what doubts and feares, doe daily wait to their parents  and tutors, before they can be nurtured and brought to any good? The  fore-shew of their inclination whilest they are young is so  uncertaine, their humours so variable, their promises so changing,  their hopes so false, and their proceedings so doubtful, that it is  very hard (yea for the wisest) to ground any certaine judgment, or  assured successe upon them. Behold Cymon, view Themistocles, and a  thousand others, how they have differed, and fallen to better from  themselves, and deceive the expectation of such as knowe them. The  young whelps both of Dogges and Beares at first sight shew their  naturall disposition, but men headlong embracing this custome or  fashion, following that humor or opinion, admitting this or that  passion, allowing of that or this law, are easily changed, and soone  disguised; yet it is hard to force the naturall propension or  readinesse of the mind, whereby it followeth, that for want of  heedie fore-sight in those that could not guide their course well,  they often employ much time in vaine, to addresse young children in  those matters whereunto they are not naturally addicted. All which  difficulties notwithstanding, mine opinion is, to bring them up in  the best and profitablest studies, and that a man should slightly  passe over those fond presages, and deceiving prognostikes, which we  over precisely gather in their infancie. And (without offence be it  said) me thinks that Plato in his \"Commonwealth\" allowed them too-  too much authoritie.    Madame, Learning joyned with true knowledge is an especiall and  gracefull ornament, and an implement of wonderful use and  consequence, namely, in persons raised to that degree of fortune  wherein you are. And in good truth, learning hath not her owne true  forme, nor can she make shew of her beauteous lineaments, if she  fall into the hands of base and vile persons. [For, as famous  Torquato Tasso saith: \"Philosophie being a rich and noble Queene,  and knowing her owne worth, graciously smileth upon and lovingly  embraceth Princes and noble men, if they become suiters to her,  admitting them as her minions, and gently affoording them all the  favours she can; whereas upon the contrarie, if she be wooed, and  sued unto by clownes, mechanicall fellowes, and such base kind of  people, she holds herselfe disparaged and disgraced, as holding no  proportion with them. And therefore see we by experience, that if a  true Gentleman or nobleman follow her with any attention, and woo  her with importunitie, he shall learne and know more of her, and  prove a better scholler in one yeare, than an ungentle or base  fellow shall in seven, though he pursue her never so attentively.\"]  She is much more readie and fierce to lend her furtherance and  direction in the conduct of a warre, to attempt honourable actions,  to command a people, to treat a peace with a prince of forraine  nation, than she is to forme an argument in Logick, to devise a  Syllogisme, to canvase a case at the barre, or to prescribe a receit  of pills. So (noble Ladie) forsomuch as I cannot perswade myselfe,  that you will either forget or neglect this point, concerning the  institution of yours, especially having tasted the sweetnesse  thereof, and being descended of so noble and learned a race. For we  yet possesse the learned compositions of the ancient and noble  Earles of Foix, from out whose heroicke loynes your husband and you  take your of-spring. And Francis Lord of Candale, your worthie  uncle, doth daily bring forth such fruits thereof, as the knowledge  of the matchlesse qualitie of your house shall hereafter extend  itselfe to many ages; I will therefore make you acquainted with one  conceit of mine, which contrarie to the common use I hold, and that  is all I am able to affoord you concerning that matter. The charge  of the Tutor, which you shall appoint your sonne, in the choice of  whom consisteth the whole substance of his education and bringing  up; on which are many branches depending, which (forasmuch as I can  adde nothing of any moment to it) I will not touch at all. And for  that point, wherein I presume to advise him, he may so far forth  give credit unto it, as he shall see just cause. To a gentleman  borne of noble parentage, and heire of a house that aymeth at true  learning, and in it would be disciplined, not so much for gane or  commoditie to himselfe (because so abject an end is far unworthie  the grace and favour of the Muses, and besides, hath a regard or  dependencie of others) nor for externall shew and ornament, but to  adorne and enrich his inward minde, desiring rather to shape and  institute an able and sufficient man, than a bare learned man; my  desire is therefore, that the parents or overseers of such a  gentleman be very circumspect, and careful in chusing his director,  whom I would rather commend for having a well composed and temperate  braine, than a full stuft head, yet both will doe well. And I would  rather prefer wisdome, judgement, civill customes, and modest  behaviour, than bare and meere literall learning; and that in his  charge he hold a new course. Some never cease brawling in their  schollers eares (as if they were still pouring in a tonell) to  follow their booke, yet is their charge nothing else but to repeat  what hath beene told them before. I would have a tutor to correct  this part, and that at first entrance, according to the capacitie of  the wit he hath in hand, he should begin to make shew of it, making  him to have a smacke of all things, and how to choose and  distinguish them, without helpe of others, sometimes opening him the  way, other times leaving him to open it by himselfe. I would not  have him to invent and speake alone, but "]]]
