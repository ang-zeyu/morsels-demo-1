DEAR MR EDITOR, I want you to print my poetry and pay for it,      and I am a friend of Mrs Leslie's; she is a poet too.        Your affectionate friend,        NOEL BASTABLE.    He licked the envelope a good deal, so that that boy shouldn't read it  going upstairs; and he wrote 'Very private' outside, and gave the letter  to the boy. I thought it wasn't any good; but in a minute the grinning  boy came back, and he was quite respectful, and said--'The Editor says,  please will you step up?'    We stepped up. There were a lot of stairs and passages, and a queer sort  of humming, hammering sound and a very funny smell. The boy was now very  polite, and said it was the ink we smelt, and the noise was the printing  machines.    After going through a lot of cold passages we came to a door; the boy  opened it, and let us go in. There was a large room, with a big, soft,  blue-and-red carpet, and a roaring fire, though it was only October; and  a large table with drawers, and littered with papers, just like the one  in Father's study. A gentleman was sitting at one side of the table; he  had a light moustache and light eyes, and he looked very young to be an  editor--not nearly so old as Father. He looked very tired and sleepy,  as if he had got up very early in the morning; but he was kind, and we  liked him. Oswald thought he looked clever. Oswald is considered a judge  of faces.    'Well,' said he, 'so you are Mrs Leslie's friends?'    'I think so,' said Noel; 'at least she gave us each a shilling, and she  wished us \"good hunting!\"'    'Good hunting, eh? Well, what about this poetry of yours? Which is the  poet?'    I can't think how he could have asked! Oswald is said to be a very  manly-looking boy for his age. However, I thought it would look duffing  to be offended, so I said--    'This is my brother Noel. He is the poet.' Noel had turned quite pale.  He is disgustingly like a girl in some ways. The Editor told us to sit  down, and he took the poems from Noel, and began to read them. Noel got  paler and paler; I really thought he was going to faint, like he did  when I held his hand under the cold-water tap, after I had accidentally  cut him with my chisel. When the Editor had read the first poem--it was  the one about the beetle--he got up and stood with his back to us. It  was not manners; but Noel thinks he did it 'to conceal his emotion,' as  they do in books. He read all the poems, and then he said--    'I like your poetry very much, young man. I'll give you--let me see; how  much shall I give you for it?'    'As much as ever you can,' said Noel. 'You see I want a good deal of  money to restore the fallen fortunes of the house of Bastable.'    The gentleman put on some eye-glasses and looked hard at us. Then he sat  down.    'That's a good idea,' said he. 'Tell me how you came to think of it.  And, I say, have you had any tea? They've just sent out for mine.'    He rang a tingly bell, and the boy brought in a tray with a teapot and  a thick cup and saucer and things, and he had to fetch another tray for  us, when he was told to; and we had tea with the Editor of the Daily  Recorder. I suppose it was a very proud moment for Noel, though I  did not think of that till afterwards. The Editor asked us a lot of  questions, and we told him a good deal, though of course I did not tell  a stranger all our reasons for thinking that the family fortunes wanted  restoring. We stayed about half an hour, and when we were going away he  said again--    'I shall print all your poems, my poet; and now what do you think  they're worth?'    'I don't know,' Noel said. 'You see I didn't write them to sell.'    'Why did you write them then?' he asked.    Noel said he didn't know; he supposed because he wanted to.    'Art for Art's sake, eh?' said the Editor, and he seemed quite  delighted, as though Noel had said something clever.    'Well, would a guinea meet your views?' he asked.    I have read of people being at a loss for words, and dumb with emotion,  and I've read of people being turned to stone with astonishment, or  joy, or something, but I never knew how silly it looked till I saw Noel  standing staring at the Editor with his mouth open. He went red and he  went white, and then he got crimson, as if you were rubbing more and  more crimson lake on a palette. But he didn't say a word, so Oswald had  to say--    'I should jolly well think so.'    So the Editor gave Noel a sovereign and a shilling, and he shook hands  with us both, but he thumped Noel on the back and said--    'Buck up, old man! It's your first guinea, but it won't be your last.  Now go along home, and in about ten years you can bring me some more  poetry. Not before--see? I'm just taking this poetry of yours because I  like it very much; but we don't put poetry in this paper at all. I shall  have to put it in another paper I know of.'    'What _do_ you put in your paper?' I asked, for Father always takes the  Daily Chronicle, and I didn't know what the Recorder was like. We chose  it because it has such a glorious office, and a clock outside lighted  up.    'Oh, news,' said he, 'and dull articles, and things about Celebrities.  If you know any Celebrities, now?'    Noel asked him what Celebrities were.    'Oh, the Queen and the Princes, and people with titles, and people who  write, or sing, or act--or do something clever or wicked.'    'I don't know anybody wicked,' said Oswald, wishing he had known Dick  Turpin, or Claude Duval, so as to be able to tell the Editor things  about them. 'But I know some one with a title--Lord Tottenham.'    'The mad old Protectionist, eh? How did you come to know him?'    'We don't know him to speak to. But he goes over the Heath every day at  three, and he strides along like a giant--with a black cloak like Lord  Tennyson's flying behind him, and he talks to himself like one o'clock.'    'What does he say?' The Editor had sat down again, and he was fiddling  with a blue pencil.    'We only heard him once, close enough to understand, and then he said,  \"The curse of the country, sir--ruin and desolation!\" And then he went  striding along again, hitting at the furze-bushes as if they were the  heads of his enemies.'    'Excellent descriptive touch,' said the Editor. 'Well, go on.'    'That's all I know about him, except that he stops in the middle of the  Heath every day, and he looks all round to see if there's any one about,  and if there isn't, he takes his collar off.'    The Editor interrupted--which is considered rude--and said--    'You're not romancing?'    'I beg your pardon?' said Oswald. 'Drawing the long bow, I mean,' said  the Editor.    Oswald drew himself up, and said he wasn't a liar.    The Editor only laughed, and said romancing and lying were not at all  the same; only it was important to know what you were playing at. So  Oswald accepted his apology, and went on.    'We were hiding among the furze-bushes one day, and we saw him do it. He  took off his collar, and he put on a clean one, and he threw the other  among the furze-bushes. We picked it up afterwards, and it was a beastly  paper one!'    'Thank you,' said the Editor, and he got up and put his hand in his  pocket. 'That's well worth five shillings, and there they are. Would you  like to see round the printing offices before you go home?'    I pocketed my five bob, and thanked him, and I said we should like it  very much. He called another gentleman and said something we couldn't  hear. Then he said good-bye again; and all this time Noel hadn't said a  word. But now he said, 'I've made a poem about you. It is called \"Lines  to a Noble Editor.\" Shall I write it down?'    The Editor gave him the blue pencil, and he sat down at the Editor's  table and wrote. It was this, he told me afterwards as well as he could  remember--        May Life's choicest blessings be your lot      I think you ought to be very blest      For you are going to print my poems--      And you may have this one as well as the rest.    'Thank you,' said the Editor. 'I don't think I ever had a poem addressed  to me before. I shall treasure it, I assure you.'    Then the other gentleman said something about Maecenas, and we went off  to see the printing office with at least one pound seven in our pockets.    It _was_ good hunting, and no mistake!    But he never put Noel's poetry in the Daily Recorder. It was quite a  long time afterwards we saw a sort of story thing in a magazine, on the  station bookstall, and that kind, sleepy-looking Editor had written it,  I suppose. It was not at all amusing. It said a lot about Noel and me,  describing us all wrong, and saying how we had tea with the Editor;  and all Noel's poems were in the story thing. I think myself the Editor  seemed to make game of them, but Noel was quite pleased to see them  printed--so that's all right. It wasn't my poetry anyhow, I am glad to  say.        CHAPTER 6. NOEL'S PRINCESS    She happened quite accidentally. We were not looking for a Princess at  all just then; but Noel had said he was going to find a Princess all by  himself; and marry her--and he really did. Which was rather odd, because  when people say things are going to befall, very often they don't. It  was different, of course, with the prophets of old.    We did not get any treasure by it, except twelve chocolate drops; but we  might have done, and it was an adventure, anyhow.    Greenwich Park is a jolly good place to play in, especially the parts  that aren't near Greenwich. The parts near the Heath are first-rate.  I often wish the Park was nearer our house; but I suppose a Park is a  difficult thing to move.    Sometimes we get Eliza to put lunch in a basket, and we go up to the  Park. She likes that--it saves cooking dinner for us; and sometimes she  says of her own accord, 'I've made some pasties for you, and you might  as well go into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7700"],[0,"Lysistrata (#7)"],[1,"   WOMEN    Yes, yes, what is it?    LYSISTRATA    Silence then, you chatterboxes.  Here--  _Whenas the swallows flocking in one place from the hoopoes  Deny themselves love's gambols any more,  All woes shall then have ending and great Zeus the Thunderer  Shall put above what was below before._    WOMEN    Will the men then always be kept under us?    LYSISTRATA  _But if the swallows squabble among themselves and fly away  Out of the temple, refusing to agree,  Then The Most Wanton Birds in all the World  They shall be named for ever. That's his decree._    WOMAN    It's obvious what it means.    LYSISTRATA                         Now by all the gods  We must let no agony deter from duty,  Back to your quarters. For we are base indeed,  My friends, if we betray the oracle.    _She goes out._      OLD MEN.    I'd like to remind you of a fable they used to employ,  When I was a little boy:  How once through fear of the marriage-bed a young man,  Melanion by name, to the wilderness ran,  And there on the hills he dwelt.  For hares he wove a net  Which with his dog he set--  Most likely he's there yet.  For he never came back home, so great was the fear he felt.  I loathe the sex as much as he,  And therefore I no less shall be  As chaste as was Melanion.    MAN    Grann'am, do you much mind men?    WOMAN    Onions you won't need, to cry.    MAN    From my foot you shan't escape.    WOMAN    What thick forests I espy.    MEN    So much Myronides' fierce beard  And thundering black back were feared,  That the foe fled when they were shown--  Brave he as Phormion.    WOMEN.    Well, I'll relate a rival fable just to show to you  A different point of view:  There was a rough-hewn fellow, Timon, with a face  That glowered as through a thorn-bush in a wild, bleak place.  He too decided on flight,  This very Furies' son,  All the world's ways to shun  And hide from everyone,  Spitting out curses on all knavish men to left and right.  But though he reared this hate for men,  He loved the women even then,  And never thought them enemies.    WOMAN    O your jaw I'd like to break.    MAN    That I fear do you suppose?    WOMAN    Learn what kicks my legs can make.    MAN    Raise them up, and you'll expose--    WOMAN    Nay, you'll see there, I engage,  All is well kept despite my age,  And tended smooth enough to slip  From any adversary's grip.    LYSISTRATA _appears_.    LYSISTRATA    Hollo there, hasten hither to me  Skip fast along.    WOMAN    What is this? Why the noise?    LYSISTRATA    A man, a man! I spy a frenzied man!  He carries Love upon him like a staff.  O Lady of Cyprus, and Cythera, and Paphos,  I beseech you, keep our minds and hands to the oath.    WOMAN    Where is he, whoever he is?    LYSISTRATA    By the Temple of Chloe.    WOMAN    Yes, now I see him, but who can he be?    LYSISTRATA    Look at him. Does anyone recognise his face?    MYRRHINE    I do. He is my husband, Cinesias.    LYSISTRATA    You know how to work. Play with him, lead him on,  Seduce him to the cozening-point--kiss him, kiss him,  Then slip your mouth aside just as he's sure of it,  Ungirdle every caress his mouth feels at  Save that the oath upon the bowl has locked.    MYRRHINE    You can rely on me.    LYSISTRATA    I'll stay here to help  In working up his ardor to its height  Of vain magnificence.... The rest to their quarters.    _Enter_ CINESIAS.    Who is this that stands within our lines?    CINESIAS    I.    LYSISTRATA    A man?    CINESIAS    Too much a man!    LYSISTRATA    Then be off at once.    CINESIAS    Who are you that thus eject me?    LYSISTRATA    Guard for the day.    CINESIAS    By all the gods, then call Myrrhine hither.    LYSISTRATA    So, call Myrrhine hither! Who are you?    CINESIAS    I am her husband Cinesias, son of Anthros.    LYSISTRATA    Welcome, dear friend! That glorious name of yours  Is quite familiar in our ranks. Your wife  Continually has it in her mouth.  She cannot touch an apple or an egg  But she must say, \"This to Cinesias!\"    CINESIAS    O is that true?    LYSISTRATA    By Aphrodite, it is.  If the conversation strikes on men, your wife  Cuts in with, \"All are boobies by Cinesias.\"    CINESIAS    Then call her here.    LYSISTRATA    And what am I to get?    CINESIAS    This, if you want it.... See, what I have here.  But not to take away.    LYSISTRATA    Then I'll call her.    CINESIAS    Be quick, be quick. All grace is wiped from life  Since she went away. O sad, sad am I  When there I enter on that loneliness,  And wine is unvintaged of the sun's flavour.  And food is tasteless. But I've put on weight.    MYRRHINE (_above_)    I love him O so much! but he won't have it.  Don't call me down to him.    CINESIAS    Sweet little Myrrhine!  What do you mean? Come here.    MYRRHINE    O no I won't.  Why are you calling me? You don't want me.    CINESIAS    Not want you! with this week-old strength of love.    MYRRHINE    Farewell.    CINESIAS    Don't go, please don't go, Myrrhine.  At least you'll hear our child. Call your mother, lad.    CHILD    Mummy ... mummy ... mummy!    CINESIAS    There now, don't you feel pity for the child?  He's not been fed or washed now for six days.    MYRRHINE    I certainly pity him with so heartless a father.    CINESIAS    Come down, my sweetest, come for the child's sake.    MYRRHINE    A trying life it is to be a mother!  I suppose I'd better go.             _She comes down._    CINESIAS    How much younger she looks,  How fresher and how prettier! Myrrhine,  Lift up your lovely face, your disdainful face;  And your ankle ... let your scorn step out its worst;  It only rubs me to more ardor here.    MYRRHINE (_playing with the child_)    You're as innocent as he's iniquitous.  Let me kiss you, honey-petting, mother's darling.    CINESIAS    How wrong to follow other women's counsel  And let loose all these throbbing voids in yourself  As well as in me. Don't you go throb-throb?    MYRRHINE    Take away your hands.    CINESIAS    Everything in the house  Is being ruined.    MYRRHINE    I don't care at all.    CINESIAS    The roosters are picking all your web to rags.  Do you mind that?    MYRRHINE    Not I.    CINESIAS    What time we've wasted  We might have drenched with Paphian laughter, flung  On Aphrodite's Mysteries. O come here.    MYRRHINE    Not till a treaty finishes the war.    CINESIAS    If you must have it, then we'll get it done.    MYRRHINE    Do it and I'll come home. Till then I am bound.    CINESIAS    Well, can't your oath perhaps be got around?    MYRRHINE    No ... no ... still I'll not say that I don't love you.    CINESIAS    You love me! Then dear girl, let me also love you.    MYRRHINE    You must be joking. The boy's looking on.    CINESIAS    Here, Manes, take the child home!... There, he's gone.  There's nothing in the way now. Come to the point.    MYRRHINE    Here in the open! In plain sight?    CINESIAS    In Pan's cave.  A splendid place.    MYRRHINE    Where shall I dress my hair again  Before returning to the citadel?    CINESIAS    You can easily primp yourself in the Clepsydra.    MYRRHINE    But how can I break my oath?    CINESIAS    Leave that to me,  I'll take all risk.    MYRRHINE    Well, I'll make you comfortable.    CINESIAS    Don't worry. I'd as soon lie on the grass.    MYRRHINE    No, by Apollo, in spite of all your faults  I won't have you lying on the nasty earth.  (_From here MYRRHINE keeps on going off to fetch things._)    CINESIAS    Ah, how she loves me.    MYRRHINE    Rest there on the bench,  While I arrange my clothes. O what a nuisance,  I must find some cushions first.    CINESIAS    Why some cushions?  Please don't get them!    MYRRHINE    What? The plain, hard wood?  Never, by Artemis! That would be too vulgar.    CINESIAS    Open your arms!    MYRRHINE    No. Wait a second.    CINESIAS    O....  Then hurry back again.    MYRRHINE    Here the cushions are.  Lie down while I--O dear! But what a shame,  You need more pillows.    CINESIAS    I don't want them, dear.    MYRRHINE    But I do.    CINESIAS    Thwarted affection mine,  They treat you just like Heracles at a feast  With cheats of dainties, O disappointing arms!    MYRRHINE    Raise up your head.    CINESIAS    There, that's everything at last.    MYRRHINE    Yes, all.    CINESIAS    Then run to my arms, you golden girl.    MYRRHINE    I'm loosening my girdle now. But you've not forgotten?  You're not deceiving me about the Treaty?    CINESIAS    No, by my life, I'm not.    MYRRHINE    Why, you've no blanket.    CINESIAS    It's not the silly blanket's warmth but yours I want.    MYRRHINE    Never mind. You'll soon have both. I'll come straight back.    CINESIAS    The woman will choke me with her coverlets.    MYRRHINE    Get up a moment.    CINESIAS    I'm up high enough.    MYRRHINE    Would you like me to perfume you?    CINESIAS    By Apollo, no!    MYRRHINE    By Aphrodite, I'll do it anyway.    CINESIAS    Lord Zeus, may she soon use up all the myrrh.    MYRRHINE    Stretch out your hand. Take it and rub it in.    CINESIAS    Hmm, it's not as fragrant as might be; that is,  Not before it's smeared. It doesn't smell of kisses.    MYRRHINE    How silly I am: I've brought you Rhodian scents.    CINESIAS    It's good enough, leave it, love.    MYRRHINE    You must be jesting.    CINESIAS    Plague rack the man who first compounded scent!    MYRRHINE    Here, take this flask.    CINESIAS    I've a far better one.  Don't tease me, come here, and get nothing more.    MYRRHINE    I'm coming.... I'm just drawing off my shoes....  You're sure you will vote for Peace?    CINESIAS    I'll think about it.  _She runs off._  I'm dead: the woman's worn me all away.  She's gone and left me with an anguished pulse.
