Look,\" she  pointed to the captain's door, from under which there was a light  shining, \"he's put a light on and he's laughing at us.\"  \"Alright, I'm  coming,\" said K., moved forward, took hold of her, kissed her on the  mouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping with  its tongue when it eventually finds water.  He finally kissed her on her  neck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time.  He  did not look up until there was a noise from the captain's room.  \"I'll  go now,\" he said, he wanted to address Miss Buerstner by her Christian  name, but did not know it.  She gave him a tired nod, offered him her  hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she was  doing, and went back into her room with her head bowed.  A short while  later, K. was lying in his bed. He very soon went to sleep, but before  he did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was satisfied  with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; he was  seriously worried about Miss Buerstner because of the captain.          Chapter Two  First Cross-examination            K. was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing  concerning his case the following Sunday. He was made aware that these  cross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not every  week but quite frequently. On the one hand it was in everyone's interest  to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand  every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly  without lasting too long because of the associated stress.  For these  reasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations  following on one after another.  Sunday had been chosen as the day for  the hearings so that K. would not be disturbed in his professional work.  It was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wished  for another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated.  Cross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K.  would probably not be fresh enough at that time.  Anyway, as long as K.  made no objection, the hearing would be left on Sundays.  It was a  matter of course that he would have to appear without fail, there was  probably no need to point this out to him.  He would be given the number  of the building where he was to present himself, which was in a street  in a suburb well away from the city centre which K. had never been to  before.            Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver without  giving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it  was certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to  it, and this first examination would probably also be the last.  He was  still standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of  the deputy director behind him - he wanted to use the telephone but K.  stood in his way.  \"Bad news?\" asked the deputy director casually, not  in order to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device.  \"No, no,\" said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely.  The deputy director picked up the receiver and, as he waited for his  connection, turned away from it and said to K.,  \"One question, Mr. K.:  Would you like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat  on Sunday morning?  There's quite a few people coming, you're bound to  know some of them.  One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney.  Would  you like to come along?  Do come along!\"  K. tried to pay attention to  what the deputy director was saying.  It was of no small importance for  him, as this invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had never  got on very well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations with  him.  It showed how important K. had become in the bank and how its  second most important official seemed to value his friendship, or at  least his impartiality.  He was only speaking at the side of the  telephone receiver while he waited for his connection, but in giving  this invitation the deputy director was humbling himself.  But K. would  have to humiliate him a second time as a result, he said, \"Thank you  very much, but I'm afraid I will have no time on Sunday, I have a  previous obligation.\"  \"Pity,\" said the deputy director, and turned to  the telephone conversation that had just been connected.  It was not a  short conversation, but K., remained standing confused by the instrument  all the time it was going on.  It was only when the deputy director hung  up that he was shocked into awareness and said, in order to partially  excuse his standing there for no reason, \"I've just received a telephone  call, there's somewhere I need to go, but they forgot to tell me what  time.\"  \"Ask them then,\" said the deputy director.  \"It's not that  important,\" said K., although in that way his earlier excuse, already  weak enough, was made even weaker.  As he went, the deputy director  continued to speak about other things.  K. forced himself to answer, but  his thoughts were mainly about that Sunday, how it would be best to get  there for nine o'clock in the morning as that was the time that courts  always start work on weekdays.            The weather was dull on Sunday.  K. was very tired, as he had  stayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the  regulars, and he had almost overslept.  He dressed hurriedly, without  the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out  during the week.  With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been  told about.  Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around  him, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case,  Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer.  The first two were travelling in a  tram that went across K.'s route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a  cafe and leant curiously over the wall as K. came over.  All of them  seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running;  it was  a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his  affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was  repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help  because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly.  And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the  committee by being too punctual.  Anyway, now he was running so that he  would get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had  no appointment for this time.            He had thought that he would recognise the building from a  distance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign  would look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the  entrance.  K. had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but  when he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of  almost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats  occupied by poor people.  Now, on  a Sunday morning, most of the windows  were occupied, men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully  and gently held small children on the sills.  Other windows were piled  up with bedding, above which the dishevelled head of a woman would  briefly appear.  People called out to each other across the street, one  of the calls provoked a loud laugh about K. himself.  It was a long  street, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level,  selling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a  few steps.  Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the  steps.  A fruitmonger, taking his goods up to the windows, was just as  inattentive as K. and nearly knocked him down with his cart.  Just then,  a gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn  out, began to play some murderous tune.            K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of  time now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one  of the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there.  It  was shortly after nine.  The building was quite far down the street, it  covered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in  particular was tall and long.  It was clearly intended for delivery  wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were  now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew  from his work at the bank.  In contrast with his usual habits, he  remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all  these external details.  Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting  on a crate and reading a newspaper.  There were two lads swinging on a  hand cart.  In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket  who, as the water flowed into her can, looked at K.  There was a piece  of rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some  washing hanging on it to dry.  A man stood below it calling out  instructions to direct the work being done.            K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing  was to take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he  could see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a  small passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard.  It  irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the  room, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or  especially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very  loudly and very unambiguously.  In the end he decided to climb up the  stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the  policeman, Willem, saying to him;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#7)"],[1,"the Velvet Pouch! for I forgot to tell you, that  one great danger of these precincts is, that the very leaves of the  trees are like so many ears, which carry all which is spoken to the  King's own cabinet.\"    \"I care little for that,\" answered Quentin Durward; \"I bear a Scottish  tongue in my head, bold enough to speak my mind to King Louis's face,  God bless him--and for the ears you talk of, if I could see them growing  on a human head, I would crop them out of it with my wood knife.\"        CHAPTER III: THE CASTLE         Full in the midst a mighty pile arose,       Where iron grated gates their strength oppose       To each invading step--and strong and steep,       The battled walls arose, the fosse sunk deep.       Slow round the fortress roll'd the sluggish stream,       And high in middle air the warder's turrets gleam.         ANONYMOUS      While Durward and his acquaintance thus spoke, they came in sight of  the whole front of the Castle of Plessis les Tours, which, even in  those dangerous times, when the great found themselves obliged to reside  within places of fortified strength, was distinguished for the extreme  and jealous care with which it was watched and defended.    From the verge of the wood where young Durward halted with his  companion, in order to take a view of this royal residence, extended,  or rather arose, though by a very gentle elevation, an open esplanade,  devoid of trees and bushes of every description, excepting one gigantic  and half withered old oak. This space was left open, according to the  rules of fortification in all ages, in order that an enemy might not  approach the walls under cover, or unobserved from the battlements, and  beyond it arose the Castle itself.    There were three external walls, battlemented and turreted from space  to space and at each angle, the second enclosure rising higher than the  first, and being built so as to command the exterior defence in case  it was won by the enemy; and being again, in the same manner, itself  commanded by the third and innermost barrier.    Around the external wall, as the Frenchman informed his young companion  (for as they stood lower than the foundation of the wall, he could not  see it), was sunk a ditch of about twenty feet in depth, supplied with  water by a dam head on the river Cher; or rather on one of its tributary  branches. In front of the second enclosure, he said, there ran another  fosse, and a third, both of the same unusual dimensions, was led between  the second and the innermost inclosure. The verge, both of the outer and  inner circuit of this triple moat was strongly fenced with palisades of  iron, serving the purpose of what are called chevaux de frise in modern  fortification, the top of each pale being divided into a cluster of  sharp spikes, which seemed to render any attempt to climb over an act of  self destruction.    From within the innermost enclosure arose the Castle itself, containing  buildings of all periods, crowded around, and united with the ancient  and grim looking donjon keep, which was older than any of them, and  which rose, like a black Ethiopian giant, high into the air, while the  absence of any windows larger than shot holes, irregularly disposed  for defence, gave the spectator the same unpleasant feeling which  we experience on looking at a blind man. The other buildings seemed  scarcely better adapted for the purposes of comfort, for the windows  opened to an inner and enclosed courtyard; so that the whole external  front looked much more like that of a prison than a palace. The reigning  King had even increased this effect; for, desirous that the additions  which he himself had made to the fortifications should be of a character  not easily distinguished from the original building (for, like many  jealous persons, he loved not that his suspicions should be observed),  the darkest coloured brick and freestone were employed, and soot mingled  with the lime, so as to give the whole Castle the same uniform tinge of  extreme and rude antiquity.    This formidable place had but one entrance--at least Durward saw none  along the spacious front, except where, in the centre of the first  and outward boundary, arose two strong towers, the usual defences of a  gateway; and he could observe their ordinary accompaniments, portcullis  and drawbridge--of which the first was lowered, and the last raised.  Similar entrance towers were visible on the second and third bounding  wall, but not in the same line with those on the outward circuit;  because the passage did not cut right through the whole three enclosures  at the same point, but, on the contrary, those who entered had to  proceed nearly thirty yards betwixt the first and second wall, exposed,  if their purpose were hostile, to missiles from both; and again, when  the second boundary was passed, they must make a similar digression  from the straight line, in order to attain the portal of the third and  innermost enclosure; so that before gaining the outer court, which ran  along the front of the building, two narrow and dangerous defiles were  to be traversed under a flanking discharge of artillery, and three  gates, defended in the strongest manner known to the age, were to be  successively forced.    Coming from a country alike desolated by foreign war and internal  feuds--a country, too, whose unequal and mountainous surface, abounding  in precipices and torrents, affords so many situations of strength,  young Durward was sufficiently acquainted with all the various  contrivances by which men, in that stern age, endeavoured to secure  their dwellings; but he frankly owned to his companion, that he did not  think it had been in the power of art to do so much for defence, where  nature had done so little; for the situation, as we have hinted, was  merely the summit of a gentle elevation ascending upwards from the place  where they were standing.    To enhance his surprise, his companion told him that the environs of  the Castle, except the single winding path by which the portal might  be safely approached, were, like the thickets through which they had  passed, surrounded with every species of hidden pitfall, snare, and gin,  to entrap the wretch who should venture thither without a guide;  that upon the walls were constructed certain cradles of iron, called  swallows' nests, from which the sentinels, who were regularly posted  there, could without being exposed to any risk, take deliberate aim at  any who should attempt to enter without the proper signal or password of  the day; and that the Archers of the Royal Guard performed that duty  day and night, for which they received high pay, rich clothing, and much  honour and profit at the hands of King Louis. \"And now tell me, young  man,\" he continued, \"did you ever see so strong a fortress, and do you  think there are men bold enough to storm it?\"    The young man looked long and fixedly on the place, the sight of which  interested him so much that he had forgotten, in the eagerness of  youthful curiosity, the wetness of his dress. His eye glanced, and his  colour mounted to his cheek like that of a daring man who meditates an  honourable action, as he replied, \"It is a strong castle, and strongly  guarded; but there is no impossibility to brave men.\"    \"Are there any in your country who could do such a feat?\" said the  elder, rather scornfully.    \"I will not affirm that,\" answered the youth; \"but there are thousands  that, in a good cause, would attempt as bold a deed.\"    \"Umph!\" said the senior, \"perhaps you are yourself such a gallant!\"    \"I should sin if I were to boast where there is no danger,\" answered  young Durward; \"but my father has done as bold an act, and I trust I am  no bastard.\"    \"Well,\" said his companion, smiling, \"you might meet your match, and  your kindred withal in the attempt; for the Scottish Archers of King  Louis's Life Guards stand sentinels on yonder walls--three hundred  gentlemen of the best blood in your country.\"    \"And were I King Louis,\" said the youth, in reply, \"I would trust my  safety to the faith of the three hundred Scottish gentlemen, throw  down my bounding walls to fill up the moat; call in my noble peers and  paladins, and live as became me, amid breaking of lances in gallant  tournaments, and feasting of days with nobles, and dancing of nights  with ladies, and have no more fear of a foe than I have of a fly.\"    His companion again smiled, and turning his back on the Castle, which,  he observed, they had approached a little too nearly, he led the way  again into the wood by a more broad and beaten path than they had yet  trodden. \"This,\" he said, \"leads us to the village of Plessis, as it  is called, where you, as a stranger, will find reasonable and honest  accommodation. About two miles onward lies the fine city of Tours,  which gives name to this rich and beautiful earldom. But the village  of Plessis, or Plessis of the Park as it is sometimes called, from  its vicinity to the royal residence, and the chase with which it is  encircled, will yield you nearer and as convenient hospitality.\"    \"I thank you, kind master, for your information,\" said the Scot; \"but my  stay will be so short here, that, if I fail not in a morsel of meat, and  a drink of something better than water, my necessities in Plessis, be it  of the park or the pool, will be amply satisfied.\"    \"Nay,\" answered his companion, \"I thought you had some friend to see in  this quarter.\"    \"And so I have--my mother's own brother,\" answered Durward; \"and as  pretty a man, before he left the braes of Angus [hills and moors of  Angus in Forfarshire, Scotland.], as ever planted brogue on heather.\"    \"What is his name?\" said the senior. \"We will inquire him out for you;  for it is not safe for you to go up to the Castle, where you might be  taken for a spy.\"    \"Now, by my father's hand!\" said the youth, \"I taken for a spy!--By  Heaven, he shall brook"]]]
