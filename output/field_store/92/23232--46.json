(#7)"],[1,"their houses by small clear  rivers and creeks or close to springs. Sometimes they are found on the  banks of lakes.    The dams which they construct with the skill of a professional civil  engineer, are built for the purpose of making sure of a full supply of  water at all times and seasons. These dams are composed of stones,  mud and tree branches, the base being ten or twelve feet in thickness  sloping gradually upward to the summit.    In building their dams, the beaver does not thrust the ends of the  stakes into the bed of the river, but lays them down horizontally,  holding them in place by piling mud and stones upon them. The logs which  compose the dams are mostly from six to eight inches in diameter, though  some have been found nearly two feet through. The enormous number of  such logs used may be imagined perhaps, when the ponderous character of  the dams is remembered, and when it is stated that some of them are more  than an eighth of a mile wide. Every log, after being gnawed off the  proper length, is stripped of its bark which is stored away for use as  food during the winter.    The lodges of the beavers are composed principally of mud, moss and  branches, circular in shape, the space within being seven feet in width  and about half as high. The walls are so thick that on the outside the  corresponding dimensions are nearly three times as great as within. The  roof is finished off with a thick layer of mud, laid on with wonderful  smoothness and renewed every year. The severe frosts of winter freeze  the lodge into such a solid structure that the beaver is safe against  the wolverine, which is unable to break through the wall, resembling the  adobe structures found in Mexico and the Southwest. Even the trapper who  attempts to demolish one of the structures finds it tiresome labor, even  with the help of iron implements.    The beavers excavate a ditch around their lodges too deep to be frozen.  Into this opens all their dwellings, the door being far below the  surface, so that free ingress and egress are secured.    The half dozen beavers occupying a lodge arrange their beds against the  wall, each separate from the other, while the centre of the chamber is  unoccupied. During summer they secure their stock of food by gnawing  down hundreds of trees, the trunks or limbs of which are sunk and  fastened in some peculiar manner to the bottom of the stream. During the  winter when the beaver feels hungry, he dives down, brings up one of the  logs, drags it to a suitable spot and nibbles off the bark.    It is impossible fully to understand how this remarkable animal does its  work, for as it never toils in the day time, it is out of the power of  any one to watch its method.    The peculiar odoriferous substance, secreted in two glandular sacs near  the root of the tail, is \"castoreum,\" more generally known as \"bark  stone\" among the trappers. The odor is powerful and is so attractive to  the animals themselves, that the trapper has only to smear some of it  near the trap which is hidden under water. Any beaver which catches the  scent, is sure to hasten to the spot and is almost certain to be caught  in the trap.        CHAPTER VIII.       Carson and two Companions set out on a Trapping Expedition of Their   Own--They Meet With Great Success--Is Engaged by Captain Lee--Carson's   Pursuit of an Indian Thief.    Kit Carson finally grew tired of wandering over the country without  gaining sight of a beaver. He proposed to two of his companions that  they start on a private expedition of their own. They were as disgusted  as he and eagerly agreed to the proposition.    The employers of the men commended the enterprise of the little company  and gave them their best wishes. Cordial farewells were exchanged all  around, and Kit and his comrades left the camp on their perilous errand.    On this occasion, as on innumerable other ones, Carson showed most  excellent judgment. His scheme was to keep entirely to the streams never  once venturing upon the plains. Several advantages were likely to  flow from this course. During the summer season the mountain Indians  generally placed their women and children in charge of the old men and  a few warriors and came down from their retreats to engage in hunting  bison or in marching on the war path. Occasionally they are at peace  with the Indians of the plains, which was a bad thing for the Mexican  settlements, for they left a track of desolation among them.    Few of the trappers ventured far into the mountains, where game was  abundant, so that Carson was confident of finding plenty of beavers.  In this he was not mistaken. The fur bearing animals seemed to be  overrunning the country, while the Indians acted not only as if unaware  of the fact but as if entirely ignorant of the little party of  visitors, who, making hay while the sun shines, were not long in finding  themselves with as large a supply as they could carry home.    This was the ordeal more to be dreaded than all the others. While on  their way to the beaver runs, they had nothing to do beyond taking  care of themselves; but now their valuable peltries were liable to be  captured by the Indians, who could compel their abandonment by pressing  the owners hard.    But extreme and altogether unexpected good fortune attended them, and  they reached Taos, without receiving a scratch or losing a fur. They  found on arriving at that quaint town, that there was great demand for  peltries and prices were correspondingly high. They sold out their stock  for a very liberal price, and Kit's friend, despite his advice, went  on a carousal which soon squandered all their hard earned wages. Kit  himself, however, had not lost the lesson he learned under somewhat  similar circumstances, and he laid away his funds, against the  proverbial rainy day.    By this time the character of Carson was fairly formed. He was resolute,  self reliant, sober, thoughtful, cool headed, wonderfully quick to grasp  all the points of a situation, chivalrous, agile as a panther, a perfect  master of woodcraft, and withal, charmingly modest.    While Carson was in Taos, waiting for some favorable opening to present  itself, he met Captain Lee, formerly of the United States Army, but who  was then a member of the firm of Bent and St. Vrain, engaged for so  many years in furnishing supplies to those who visited the mountains and  plains. Captain Lee at that time was thus employed and knowing the value  of a man like Carson, he made him so liberal an offer that he accepted  it on the spot.    In the Autumn of 1832, with a train of mules loaded with such goods as  were needed by trappers, Captain Lee, Carson and a number of men started  northward to find their purchasers. They followed the well worn mule  path leading from New Mexico to California and which had been known for  years as the \"Old Spanish Trail.\"    They reached White River without mishap, and made their way down it  until Green River was forded, when they struck across the country to  Winty River, where they came upon a party of twenty hunters, who were  engaged in trading and trapping as opportunity offered. They affiliated  at once, for there is something in the presence of a common danger which  draws men closely together.    The weather became very cold and snow began to fall. It was decided,  therefore, to go into winter quarters near the mouth of Winty River.  There they erected skin lodges, such as are used by many tribes of  American Indians, and were content to wait the coming of spring.    The skill and address of Carson seemed to create a call for his  services, no matter where he happened to be, and it was not long before  he became involved in a most remarkable adventure.    Among the employees of the other party, was a shrewd civilized Indian,  who was held in high regard by the whites on account of his native  keenness, and who stood well in the confidence of his employer; but one  day he disappeared, simultaneously with several of the very best  horses. The circumstances were such that there could be no doubt the two  occurrences were inseparably connected.    The loss was too serious to be borne, and the angered leader of the  other company (though he had not the least claim upon young Carson),  appealed to him to help him to recover his property. Carson said he was  perfectly willing, provided Captain Lee would give his consent, and as  the Captain was more willing to help his friend, he directed Carson to  do as he saw fit.    The matchless hunter made sure his weapons were in the best order, and,  mounting one of the fleetest horses in camp, he waved a merry farewell  to his friends and galloped off. He had not ridden far when he turned  off toward an Indian village, whose people were on friendly terms with  the hunters, and, riding directly among the red men, whose lingo he  understood, he asked for one of their bravest warriors to join him  in hunting down a California Indian that had run off with their best  horses.    Such a request coming from any other hunter would have received little  notice; but those dusky barbarians not only knew Carson by name, but  looked upon him as the greatest white warrior they had ever seen. He  could have secured a score of braves had he wanted them, but he desired  only one--a sinewy, daring fellow whom he knew could be relied on in any  emergency. This Indian required no more time than Carson himself to make  ready, and, shortly after Kit's arrival in the village, he rode forth  again with his faithful friend at his elbow.    It was impossible for the thief to conceal the trail of the stolen  horses and he made no attempt to do so. A slight examination showed the  pursuers that it led down the Green River, the general course being such  that Carson was confident the thief was making for California--a long  distance away.    As the fugitive was well mounted and all his horses were fleet, and as  he must have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7885"],[0,"Celtic Fairy Tales (#7)"],[1,"y, and when his  waiting-man came to him, he said to him to let the stable gillies know  that something was wrong with the horse. The gillies came, and the king  went with them. When Conall and his sons perceived the company coming  they went to the hiding holes.    The king was a wary man, and he saw where the horses were making a  noise.    \"Be wary,\" said the king, \"there are men within the stable, let us get  at them somehow.\"    The king followed the tracks of the men, and he found them. Every one  knew Conall, for he was a valued tenant of the king of Erin, and when  the king brought them up out of the holes he said, \"Oh, Conall, is it  you that are here?\"    \"I am, O king, without question, and necessity made me come. I am under  thy pardon, and under thine honour, and under thy grace.\" He told how  it happened to him, and that he had to get the brown horse for the king  of Erin, or that his sons were to be put to death. \"I knew that I  should not get him by asking, and I was going to steal him.\"    \"Yes, Conall, it is well enough, but come in,\" said the king. He  desired his look-out men to set a watch on the sons of Conall, and to  give them meat. And a double watch was set that night on the sons of  Conall.    \"Now, O Conall,\" said the king, \"were you ever in a harder place than  to be seeing your lot of sons hanged tomorrow? But you set it to my  goodness and to my grace, and say that it was necessity brought it on  you, so I must not hang you. Tell me any case in which you were as hard  as this, and if you tell that, you shall get the soul of your youngest  son.\"    \"I will tell a case as hard in which I was,\" said Conall. \"I was once a  young lad, and my father had much land, and he had parks of year-old  cows, and one of them had just calved, and my father told me to bring  her home. I found the cow, and took her with us. There fell a shower of  snow. We went into the herd's bothy, and we took the cow and the calf  in with us, and we were letting the shower pass from us. Who should  come in but one cat and ten, and one great one-eyed fox-coloured cat as  head bard over them. When they came in, in very deed I myself had no  liking for their company. 'Strike up with you,' said the head bard,  'why should we be still? and sing a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw.' I was  amazed that my name was known to the cats themselves. When they had  sung the cronan, said the head bard, 'Now, O Conall, pay the reward of  the cronan that the cats have sung to thee.' 'Well then,' said I  myself, 'I have no reward whatsoever for you, unless you should go down  and take that calf.' No sooner said I the word than the two cats and  ten went down to attack the calf, and in very deed, he did not last  them long. 'Play up with you, why should you be silent? Make a cronan  to Conall Yellowclaw,' said the head bard. Certainly I had no liking at  all for the cronan, but up came the one cat and ten, and if they did  not sing me a cronan then and there! 'Pay them now their reward,' said  the great fox-coloured cat. 'I am tired myself of yourselves and your  rewards,' said I. 'I have no reward for you unless you take that cow  down there.' They betook themselves to the cow, and indeed she did not  last them long.    \"'Why will you be silent? Go up and sing a cronan to Conall  Yellowclaw,' said the head bard. And surely, oh king, I had no care for  them or for their cronan, for I began to see that they were not good  comrades. When they had sung me the cronan they betook themselves down  where the head bard was. 'Pay now their reward, said the head bard; and  for sure, oh king, I had no reward for them; and I said to them, 'I  have no reward for you.' And surely, oh king, there was catterwauling  between them. So I leapt out at a turf window that was at the back of  the house. I took myself off as hard as I might into the wood. I was  swift enough and strong at that time; and when I felt the rustling  toirm of the cats after me I climbed into as high a tree as I saw in  the place, and one that was close in the top; and I hid myself as well  as I might. The cats began to search for me through the wood, and they  could not find me; and when they were tired, each one said to the other  that they would turn back. 'But,' said the one-eyed fox-coloured cat  that was commander-in-chief over them, 'you saw him not with your two  eyes, and though I have but one eye, there's the rascal up in the  tree.' When he had said that, one of them went up in the tree, and as  he was coming where I was, I drew a weapon that I had and I killed him.  'Be this from me!' said the one-eyed one--'I must not be losing my  company thus; gather round the root of the tree and dig about it, and  let down that villain to earth.' On this they gathered about the tree,  and they dug about the root, and the first branching root that they  cut, she gave a shiver to fall, and I myself gave a shout, and it was  not to be wondered at.    \"There was in the neighbourhood of the wood a priest, and he had ten  men with him delving, and he said, 'There is a shout of a man in  extremity and I must not be without replying to it.' And the wisest of  the men said, 'Let it alone till we hear it again.' The cats began  again digging wildly, and they broke the next root; and I myself gave  the next shout, and in very deed it was not a weak one. 'Certainly,'  said the priest, 'it is a man in extremity--let us move.' They set  themselves in order for moving. And the cats arose on the tree, and  they broke the third root, and the tree fell on her elbow. Then I gave  the third shout. The stalwart men hastened, and when they saw how the  cats served the tree, they began at them with the spades; and they  themselves and the cats began at each other, till the cats ran away.  And surely, oh king, I did not move till I saw the last one of them  off. And then I came home. And there's the hardest case in which I ever  was; and it seems to me that tearing by the cats were harder than  hanging to-morrow by the king of Lochlann.\"    \"Och! Conall,\" said the king, \"you are full of words. You have freed  the soul of your son with your tale; and if you tell me a harder case  than that you will get your second youngest son, and then you will have  two sons.\"    \"Well then,\" said Conall, \"on condition that thou dost that, I will  tell thee how I was once in a harder case than to be in thy power in  prison to-night.\"    \"Let's hear,\" said the king.    \"I was then,\" said Conall, \"quite a young lad, and I went out hunting,  and my father's land was beside the sea, and it was rough with rocks,  caves, and rifts. When I was going on the top of the shore, I saw as if  there were a smoke coming up between two rocks, and I began to look  what might be the meaning of the smoke coming up there. When I was  looking, what should I do but fall; and the place was so full of  heather, that neither bone nor skin was broken. I knew not how I should  get out of this. I was not looking before me, but I kept looking  overhead the way I came--and thinking that the day would never come  that I could get up there. It was terrible for me to be there till I  should die. I heard a great clattering coming, and what was there but a  great giant and two dozen of goats with him, and a buck at their head.  And when the giant had tied the goats, he came up and he said to me,  'Hao O! Conall, it's long since my knife has been rusting in my pouch  waiting for thy tender flesh.' 'Och!' said I, 'it's not much you will  be bettered by me, though you should tear me asunder; I will make but  one meal for you. But I see that you are one-eyed. I am a good leech,  and I will give you the sight of the other eye.' The giant went and he  drew the great caldron on the site of the fire. I myself was telling  him how he should heat the water, so that I should give its sight to  the other eye. I got heather and I made a rubber of it, and I set him  upright in the caldron. I began at the eye that was well, pretending to  him that I would give its sight to the other one, till I left them as  bad as each other; and surely it was easier to spoil the one that was  well than to give sight to the other.    \"When he saw that he could not see a glimpse, and when I myself said to  him that I would get out in spite of him, he gave a spring out of the  water, and he stood in the mouth of the cave, and he said that he would  have revenge for the sight of his eye. I had but to stay there crouched  the length of the night, holding in my breath in such a way that he  might not find out where I was.    \"When he felt the birds calling in the morning, and knew that the day  was, he said--'Art thou sleeping? Awake and let out my lot of goats.' I  killed the buck. He cried, 'I do believe that thou art killing my buck.'    \"'I am not,' said I, 'but the ropes are so tight that I take long to  loose them.' I let out one of the goats, and there he was caressing  her, and he said to her, 'There thou art thou shaggy, hairy white goat;  and thou seest me, but I see thee not.' I kept letting them out by the  way of one and one, as I flayed the buck, and before the last one was  out I had him flayed bag-wise. Then I went and I put my legs in place  of his legs, and my hands in place of his forelegs, and my head in  place of his head, and the horns on top of my head, so that the brute  might think that it was the buck. I went out. When I was going out the  giant laid his hand on me, and he said, 'There thou art, thou pretty  buck; thou seest me, but I see thee not.' When I myself got out, and I  saw the world about me, surely, oh, king! joy was on me. When I was out  and had shaken the skin off me, I said to the brute, 'I am out now in  spite of you.'    \"'Aha!' said he, 'hast thou done this to me. Since thou wert so  stalwart that thou hast got out, I will give thee a ring that I have  here; keep the ring, and it will do thee good.'    \"'I will not take the ring from you,' said I,"]]]
