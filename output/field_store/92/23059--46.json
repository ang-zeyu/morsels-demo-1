This is the first and also the last round in the ladder  that leads to the perfect knowledge of God. Without the same spirit  of revelation that dwelt in the breasts of prophets, patriarchs, and  apostles in ancient time, no man can _begin_ to know God, neither can  any man or set of men make any _progress_ in the knowledge of God, when  that spirit is withdrawn from him.    A word from the mouth of the Great Arbitrator of all controversy ought  to suffice. HE, THE GREAT GOD AND JUDGE OF ALL, has said that \"no man  knoweth the Father but the Son, and no man knoweth the Son but he to  whom the Son revealeth him.\" Words cannot bear a plainer import. If any  man knows Jesus Christ, it is by _revelation_, and in no other way can  he be known. Will you say that apostles and prophets know him in this  way; while others _may_ know him without themselves being gifted with  the spirit of revelation? Absurd! Others must know him by revelation  as much as apostles and prophets. If they have not the spirit of  revelation, they cannot judge what is a genuine and infallible  revelation when it proceeds from the pen of apostles, or even the  lips of angels, or of God himself; for the things of the Spirit are  correctly judged only by those who have the same spirit; hence all men  must not only be born of the _spirit_, but likewise be baptized into  one and the same spirit.    This spirit is the Spirit of God, and nothing less; and the Spirit  of God is the spirit of revelation, because it is expressly declared  that the spirit takes of the things of God, and shows them unto men:  even the deep things of God are searched out and dispensed to men  for their comfort and the illumination of their minds. Hence Jesus  declared that he would send them another \"comforter,\" even the spirit  of truth; and the office of this spirit of truth was to \"lead into all  truth.\" By this means we perceive that the universal store-house of  all truth is thrown open and rendered available to such as have been  properly baptized into the spirit, as their occasion may demand. Even  the apostles were forbid to go out and preach until they were endowed  with the gift of the Holy Ghost. After they should receive this gift,  it would then become their duty to impart it unto all others freely, by  the imposition of hands, who should obey the gospel. Males and females  were to partake of it, and see in vision things to come, and have  their remembrance of things past quickened into vivid and unambiguous  recollection.    It was this spirit of revelation that gave to the primitive church  the power of godliness; for it was simply the Holy Spirit of God that  rendered the gospel the power of God unto salvation to them that  believed; for therein was the righteousness of God _revealed_ from  faith to faith. The gospel never took any effect upon men's hearts,  unless the Spirit of God attended it. Whenever God takes away from the  church the spirit of revelation, he thereby takes away the light of the  church--the good spirit of the church, and the _truth_ and integrity of  the church, and the comfort of the church, and also the power of it. It  becomes like the branch without sap, or the pale mortal corpse without  the living spirit.    A church that is built upon the principle of revelation by the Holy  Spirit can never be prevailed against while that spirit continues  with it. It then becomes the power of God personified. Mere men and  women--servants and handmaidens--attended by the Holy Spirit of God,  know about men and things, and matters and events, even as God knows;  because they have precisely the same spirit that God has. Things that  never entered the heart of man to conceive, and things that the tongue  could never utter, are revealed by the Spirit of God. As bodily eyes  are to the corporal organization (causing all that wide difference that  exists between him that sees and one that is wholly blind) so are the  eyes of intelligence which the Spirit imparts to a believer, whereby  he comprehends the different spirits of men from time to time, and  sees events in the future as though they were actually and presently  at hand. The daughters of Philip can speak prophetically, with as  much unerring certainty as God himself, according to the measure of  the spirit given them, because they have His Spirit, and consequently  a given measure of intelligence. And the scope of this increase of  intelligence is expanded or diminished as God pleases to suit the  occasion.    When there is occasion to prophecy, or speak with new tongues, or  interpret, or rebuke diseases and cast out evil spirits--His Spirit is  given. And it could be given as well to a beast as to a man for the  same purpose, and the same effect would follow. The beast of Balaam,  when inspired of God, rose immediately above his legitimate sphere of  action, and spoke with a man's voice, forbidding the madness of the  prophet. The same spirit by which he spoke, would have enabled the dumb  ass to rebuke disease, cast out devils, or speak a variety of tongues.  But God might withdraw that spirit, and he would then be only a dumb  ass, fit only to bear burdens, &c. Men are but little more competent  to heal the sick, cast out devils, and discern spirits, or know the  things of God or eternity, and make preparations for the future,  than the beasts, without the Spirit of God. When God wants to punish  a generation or generations, he does it effectually by withholding  His Spirit. The world travels in pain, and groans in bondage, and  oppression, and cruelty, and strife, and bloodshed, and in ignorance,  superstition, and zeal without knowledge, when God shuts out the light  of revelation. The revelations given to the primitive age, bear about  the same relation of benefit to the people of this age, that the gift  of food and manna, to those starving in former ages, bears towards the  supply of such as are in want now. Jesus Christ winds up his sermon on  the mount, by calling him a WISE man that hears and obeys the voice of  revelation, and _he_ shall never \"fall.\" At the same time he calls him  that hears and obeys not the voice of revelation a FOOL, and such a man  will _fall_, and his fall will be great.    We cannot be in any doubt what is meant by the expression \"hearing\"  Christ, or \"these sayings of mine.\" Jesus says to such servants as he  sends out to preach, (and none but such as are sent by revelation can  preach), he that heareth YOU heareth ME. But while they cannot hear  without a preacher, neither can they hear _with_ a preacher, except  the Father draw them; or, in other words, except they have the Spirit  of God, which is a spirit of _revelation_. How could Peter know Jesus,  when he heard his conversation and preaching? Jesus testifies that, by  the wisdom of flesh and blood, Peter did _not_ know him, but by the  spirit of revelation from God out of heaven; and in order to end all  controversy throughout all ages, he declares that not only Peter, but  NO OTHER MAN, ever _did_ or ever _can_ know God, only as he is revealed  to him from heaven; and that man is \"blessed\" that has the spirit of  revelation to know the only true God and Jesus Christ. That man is  accounted as a thief and a robber that would know God or Jesus without  the spirit of revelation.    The Spirit of God was sent into the world for the express purpose of  acquainting men with Jesus Christ. By this spirit it was an easy matter  for men to know Jesus Christ, though he was everywhere spoken against,  and the whole country teemed with lies, and the great mass of people,  reputedly good as well as bad, thought that he ought to be _stoned,  mobbed, and crucified_: still it was easy to know him by the spirit  of revelation, and it was impossible to know him without that spirit.  Thus, dear sir, it is easy for you, and all my former associates in  the sectarian ministry, to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the  Lord, sent to prune the Lord's vineyard for the last time.    Says the scripture, \"no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, can call  Jesus accursed,\" although he \"hung upon a tree.\" And I add, sir, with  perfect assurance, that no man can call Joseph Smith \"accursed,\" or an  \"impostor,\" while speaking by the Spirit of God; for the Spirit of God  will never dictate any one to speak against the servant of God; but the  spirit of the world and of Satan, _will_ stir up men to speak against  prophets and saints, and persecute and assassinate them. The scripture  also says, that no man can call Jesus Lord, but by the HOLY GHOST.  Thus, reverend sir, you perceive that NO MAN, in former ages or latter  ages, can call Jesus Lord, but by revelation from the HOLY GHOST. It is  by the person and agency of the HOLY GHOST only, that Jesus promises  to be with his preachers always unto the end of the world, in order to  reveal the truth unto honest hearers, and show them who are prophets  and true ministers of Christ, and also what is true doctrine. The HOLY  GHOST will always attend a true minister of God, and reveal to his  humble honest hearers, his mission and authority beyond all reasonable  doubt.    Now, sir, let me say, distinctly, that the testimony of any number of  men, or of all men together, is no proof either _for_ or _against_ the  authority, doctrine, or mission of a prophet or true minister of God.  For if no _one_ man can know a minister of God without revelation, then  no large body of men can know him; and surely they cannot testify of  what they do not KNOW. No matter what is said against Joseph Smith, or  who, or how many, say it, or however _credible_ the witnesses, they are  not competent to testify, because they have not the gift of revelation.  This position, sir, is invincible, because it is fortified by the voice  of eternal truth, even the word of God, which you profess publicly to  believe, and preach, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#7)"],[1,"here, in  her early history, Rome, as a single city, is of equal weight in peace  or war with whole confederations.    The happy position of certain hills by the Tiber had enabled one lucky  group of Latin settlements to coalesce into a single city as great  as all the others put together. But at Veii we see the marks of what  clearly was a great city, a city fully equal in extent to Rome. And  when the ancient writers tell us that, in riches and splendour, in the  character of its public and private buildings, Veii far surpassed Rome,  it is only what we should expect from a great and ancient Etruscan city  which had entered on the stage of decline when Rome was entering on the  stage of youthful greatness. There was little fear of Veii overthrowing  Rome; but both sides must have felt that a day would come when Rome  would be very likely to overthrow Veii. Two cities so great and so near  together could not go on together. Two cities, very great according  to the standard of those times, considerable according even to a  modern standard, cities of nations differing in blood, language, and  everything else which can keep nations asunder, stood so near that the  modern inquirer can drive from one to the other, spend several hours  on its site, and drive back again, between an ordinary breakfast and  dinner. Rivalry and bitter hatred were unavoidable. Veii must have felt  all the deadly grief of being outstripped by a younger rival, while  Rome must have felt that Veii was the great hindrance to any advance of  her dominion on the right bank of her own river. No form of alliance,  confederation, or dependence was possible; a death struggle must come  sooner or later between the old Etruscan and the newer Latin city.    The site of Veii is that of a great city, a strong city, but not a city  made, like Rome, for rule. We go far and wide, and we find nothing  like the \"great group of village communities by the Tiber.\" Veii is  not a group, and she has no Tiber. The city stood high on the rocks,  yet it can hardly be called a hill-city. A peninsular site rises above  the steep and craggy banks of two small streams which make up the  fateful Cremera; but the peninsula itself is nearly a table-land, a  table-land surrounded by hills. The stream supplied the walls with an  admirable natural fosse, and that was all. The vast space enclosed by  the walls makes us naturally ask whether the city could have been laid  out on so great a scale from the beginning. We may believe that, as  in so many cases, the _arx_, a peninsula within a peninsula, was the  original city, and that the rest was taken in afterwards. But, if so,  it would seem as if it must have been taken in at a blow, as if Veii  took a single leap from littleness to greatness, unlike the gradual  growth of Rome or Syracuse. At all events, there is the undoubted  extent of a great city, a city clearly of an earlier type than Rome, a  city which may well have reached its present extent while Rome had not  spread beyond the Palatine. Such a site marks a great advance on the  occupation of inaccessible hill-tops; but Veii itself must have seemed  an old-world city in the eyes of those who had the highway of the Tiber  below their walls.    It is strange to step out the traces of a city whose position and  extent are so unmistakably marked, but of which nothing is left which  can be called a building, or even a ruin. The most memorable work in  the circuit of Veii is a work not of building but of boring--the Ponte  Sodo, hewn in the rock for the better passage of the guardian stream.  Besides these, some small fragments of the Etruscan wall, the signs  of a double gate, some masonry of the small Roman tower which in after  times arose within the forsaken walls, are pretty well all that remains  of the life of Veii. The remains of its death are more plentiful.  There is the Roman _columbarium_, within the Etruscan site; there  are the Etruscan tombs bored deep in all the surrounding hills. There  is, above all, the famous painted tomb, shielding no such sculptures  and inscriptions as those on which we gaze in the great Volumnian  sepulchre, but within which one lucky eye was privileged for a moment  to see the Lucumo himself, as he crumbled away at the entrance of the  unaccustomed air. A scrap or two of his harness is there still; the  arms are there; the strange-shaped beasts are there, in their primitive  form and colouring; the guardian lions keep the door; but we have no  written aenigma even to guess at. We can only feel our way to a date by  marking the imperfect attempt at an arch, an earlier and ruder stage  by far than the roof of Rome's _Tullianum_ or its fellow at Tusculum.  In the Volumnian tomb the main interest comes from the fact that it  belongs to the very latest Etruscan times, to the transition from  Etruscan to Roman life. In the Veientine tomb the main interest comes  from the fact that it cannot be later than an early stage in Roman  history, and that it may be as much earlier as we choose to think  it. It is the same with all the little that is left of Veii. We know  that, except the palpable remains of the Roman _municipium_, nothing  can be later than B.C. 396, and that anything may be vastly earlier.  In the history of Italy, the date when Rome doubled her territory by  conquering a city a dozen miles from her gates passes for an early  stage. The life of Rome is still before her. In Greece at the same  date, the greatness of Athens, the truest greatness of Sparta, is past;  the only fresh life that is to come is that of ephemeral Thebes and  half-Hellenic Macedonia.    We turn from Veii, feeling how thoroughly true in its main outline, how  utterly untrustworthy in its detail, is what passes for early Roman  history. The legend of Veii counts for less than the legend of Troy,  inasmuch as invention and combination are hardly genuine legend at all.  But that Veii was and is not, that her fall was the rising point in  Rome's destiny, that it was needful for the course of things which has  stretched from that day to this that Veii should cease to be--all this  we understand ten times the better when we turn from the living tale of  Livy to the yet more living witness of the forsaken site.          Fidenae.      From the villa of the White Hens we looked across to the _arx_ of  Fidenae as one of the main points in the view. The hill of Castel  Giubeleo seems planted there by the hand of nature as a border-defence  of Latium against Etruscan attacks. Yet both strong sites and other  things sometimes fail to discharge the exact functions which seem to  have been laid upon them by the hand of nature. The post which seems  designed as the Latin bulwark against the Etruscan does, as a matter  of fact, play its chief part in history in the character of an Etruscan  outpost on Latin soil. Whether Fidenae was really such an outpost in the  strict sense, whether it was a remnant of the wider Etruscan dominion  of the days when the Tiber was not a border-stream, or whether it was  a Latin town which, from whatever cause, chose to throw itself on the  Etruscan side, it is not only as the enemy of Rome, but as the ally  of Veii, that Fidenae made itself memorable. If we accept the received  story, the war which brought about the ruin of Fidenae was caused  because its people slew the envoys of Rome in obedience to the hasty,  perhaps misinterpreted, words of a Veientine king. The king who thus  took so little heed of the law of nations of course paid his forfeit,  and the Royal spoils won from Lars Tolumnius by Aulus Cornelius Cossus  formed one of the most cherished relics of the early days of Rome. We  may believe the details of the story or not; but the spoils at least  were real, if the witness of Augustus Caesar is to be believed.    Each of the roads which lead out of Rome--since the railway came,  there is practically only one way which leads into Rome--has its own  special interest, and the Salarian way is certainly not inferior to  the Cassian or the Flaminian. We leave the city by that which in  its material fabric is the most modern, which in its associations  is perhaps the most historic, of all the gates of Rome. The Salarian  gate in the wall of Aurelian may be looked at as in some sort drawing  to itself the memories of the neighbouring Colline gate in the wall  of Servius. He who fought before the Colline gate, he who entered by  the Colline gate, could hardly fail to march over the ground where in  the new system of defence the Salarian gate was to arise. The Colline  gate on the high ground of the Quirinal hill was the weakest point of  Rome; it was therefore specially strengthened in the Servian line of  defence. It was the point by which most of the early invaders of Rome  marched in or strove to march in. There the revolted troops entered to  put down the tyranny of the decemvirs; there the Gauls came in after  the slaughter of the Allia; to that gate Hannibal drew near, and those  who did not understand Hannibal said that he hurled his spear over it.  Before the Colline gate Rome had for the last time to struggle for the  dominion of Italy in the fight between Sulla and Pontius Telesinus.  And when the Colline gate had given way to the Salarian, it was at the  new entrance to Rome that the enemy came in whose coming declared that  her political dominion over the world had ceased, but that her moral  dominion was stronger than ever. \"At midnight the Salarian gate was  silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous  sound of the Gothic trumpet.\" And if these gates were a centre of  fighting, they were also, in a strange and special way, a centre of  burying. Along this road, as along others, we mark the broken tombs  here and there, two pre-eminently just outside the present gate; but  this quarter supplies one strange contrast in the matter of burials  which is not to be found elsewhere. Outside the Colline "]]]
