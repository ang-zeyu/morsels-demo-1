Do you understand? A keen, politic  head. Yes! when I think what you were only an hour ago, and what you  are now, and that it is all owing to one happy thought. Yes, of course,  you must have a chief, and you'll own that he who struck out this idea  may claim to have an enlightened and politic head?    ROLLER. If one could hope, if one could dream, but I fear he will not  consent.    SPIEGEL. Why not? Speak out boldly, friend! Difficult as it may be to  steer a laboring vessel against wind and tide, oppressive as may be the  weight of a crown, speak your thought without hesitation, Roller!  Perhaps he may be prevailed upon after all!    ROLLER. And if he does not the whole vessel will be crazy enough.  Without Moor we are a \"body without a soul.\"    SPIEGEL. (turning angrily from him). Dolt! blockhead!         (Enter CHARLES VON MOOR in violent agitation, stalking backwards     and forwards, and speaking to himself.)      CHARLES VON M. Man--man! false, perfidious crocodile-brood! Your eyes  are all tears, but your hearts steel! Kisses on your lips, but daggers  couched in your bosoms! Even lions and tigers nourish their young.  Ravens feast their brood on carrion, and he--he Malice I have learned to  bear; and I can smile when my fellest enemy drinks to me in my own  heart's blood; but when kindred turn traitors, when a father's love  becomes a fury's hate; oh, then, let manly resignation give place to  raging fire! the gentle lamb become a tiger! and every nerve strain  itself to vengeance and destruction!    ROLLER. Hark ye, Moor! What think ye of it? A robber's life is  pleasanter, after all, than to lie rotting on bread and water in the  lowest dungeon of the castle?    CHARLES VON M. Why was not this spirit implanted in a tiger which gluts  its raging jaws with human flesh? Is this a father's tenderness? Is  this love for love? Would I were a bear to rouse all the bears of the  north against this murderous race! Repentance, and no pardon! Oh, that  I could poison the ocean that men might drink death from every spring!  Contrition, implicit reliance, and no pardon!    ROLLER. But listen, Moor,--listen to what I am telling you!    CHARLES VON M. 'Tis incredible! 'tis a dream--a delusion! Such earnest  entreaty, such a vivid picture of misery and tearful penitence--a savage  beast would have been melted to compassion! stones would have wept, and  yet he--it would be thought a malicious libel upon human nature were I  to proclaim it--and yet, yet--oh, that I could sound the trumpet of  rebellion through all creation, and lead air, and earth, and sea into  battle array against this generation of hyenas!    GRIMM. Hear me, only hear me! You are deaf with raving.    CHARLES VON M. Avaunt, avaunt! Is not thy name man? Art thou not born  of woman? Out of my sight, thou thing with human visage! I loved him  so unutterably!--never son so loved a father; I would have sacrificed a  thousand lives for him (foaming and stamping the ground). Ha! where is  he that will put a sword into my hand that I may strike this generation  of vipers to the quick! Who will teach me how to reach their heart's  core, to crush, to annihilate the whole race? Such a man shall be my  friend, my angel, my god--him will I worship!    ROLLER. Such friends behold in us; be but advised!    SCHW. Come with us into the Bohemian forests! We will form a band of  robbers there, and you (MOOR stares at him).    SCHWEIT. You shall be our captain! you must be our captain!    SPIEGEL. (throws himself into a chair in a rage). Slaves and cowards!    CHARLES VON M. Who inspired thee with that thought? Hark, fellow!  (grasping ROLLER tightly) that human soul of thine did not produce it;  who suggested it to thee? Yes, by the thousand arms of death! that's  what we will, and what we must do! the thought's divine. He who  conceived it deserves to be canonized. Robbers and murderers! As my  soul lives, I am your captain!    ALL (with tumultuous shouts). Hurrah! long live our captain!    SPIEGEL. (starting up, aside). Till I give him his _coup de grace_!    CHARLES VON M. See, it falls like a film from my eyes! What a fool was  I to think of returning to be caged? My soul's athirst for deeds, my  spirit pants for freedom. Murderers, robbers! with these words I  trample the law underfoot--mankind threw off humanity when I appealed to  it. Away, then, with human sympathies and mercy! I no longer have a  father, no longer affections; blood and death shall teach me to forget  that anything was ever dear to me! Come! come! Oh, I will recreate  myself with some most fearful vengeance;--'tis resolved, I am your  captain! and success to him who Shall spread fire and slaughter the  widest and most savagely--I pledge myself He shall be right royally  rewarded. Stand around me, all of you, and swear to me fealty and  obedience unto death! Swear by this trusty right hand.    ALL (place their hands in his). We swear to thee fealty and obedience  unto death!    CHARLES VON M. And, by this same trusty right Hand, I here swear to you  to remain your captain, true and faithful unto death! This arm shall  make an instant corpse of him who doubts, or fears, or retreats. And  may the same befall me from your hands if I betray my oath! Are you  content?         [SPIEGELBERG runs up and down in a furious rage.]      ALL (throwing up their hats). We are content!    CHARLES VON M. Well, then, let us be gone! Fear neither death nor  danger, for an unalterable destiny rules over us. Every man has his  doom, be it to die on the soft pillow of down, or in the field of blood,  or on the scaffold, or the wheel! One or the other of these must be our  lot! [Exeunt.]    SPIEGEL.

FRANCIS, AMELIA.    FRANCIS. Your face is averted from me, Amelia? Am I less worthy than  he who is accursed of his father?    AMELIA. Away! Oh! what a loving, compassionate father, who abandons  his son a prey to wolves and monsters! In his own comfortable home he  pampers himself with delicious wines and stretches his palsied limbs on  down, while his noble son is starving. Shame upon you, inhuman  wretches! Shame upon you, ye souls of dragons, ye blots on humanity!--  his only son!    FRANCIS. I thought he had two.    AMELIA. Yes, he deserves to have such sons as you are. On his deathbed  he will in vain stretch out his withered hands for his Charles, and  recoil with a shudder when he feels the ice-cold hand of his Francis.  Oh, it is sweet, deliciously sweet, to be cursed by such a father! Tell  me, Francis, dear brotherly soul--tell me what must one do to be cursed  by him?    FRANCIS. You are raving, dearest; you are to be pitied.    AMELIA. Oh! indeed. Do you pity your brother? No, monster, you hate  him! I hope you hate me too.    FRANCIS. I love you as dearly as I love myself, Amelia!    AMELIA. If you love me you will not refuse me one little request.    FRANCIS. None, none! if you ask no more than my life.    AMELIA. Oh, if that is the case! then one request, which you will so  easily, so readily grant. (Loftily.) Hate me! I should perforce blush  crimson if, whilst thinking of Charles, it should for a moment enter my  mind that you do not hate me. You promise me this? Now go, and leave  me; I so love to be alone!    FRANCIS. Lovely enthusiast! how greatly I admire your gentle,  affectionate heart. Here, here, Charles reigned sole monarch, like a  god within his temple; he stood before thee waking, he filled your  imaination dreaming; the whole creation seemed to thee to centre in  Charles, and to reflect him alone; it gave thee no other echo but of  him.    AMELIA (with emotion). Yes, verily, I own it. Despite of you all,  barbarians as you are, I will own it before all the world. I love him!    FRANCIS. Inhuman, cruel! So to requite a love like this! To forget  her--    AMELIA (starting). What! forget me?    FRANCIS. Did you not place a ring on his finger?--a diamond ring, the  pledge of your love? To be sure how is it possible for youth to resist  the fascinations of a wanton? Who can blame him for it, since he had  nothing else left to give away? and of course she repaid him with  interest by her caresses and embraces.    AMELIA (with indignation). My ring to a wanton?    FRANCIS. Fie, fie! it is disgraceful. 'Twould not be much, however, if  that were all. A ring, be it ever so costly, is, after all, a thing  which one may always buy of a Jew. Perhaps the fashion of it did not  please him, perhaps he exchanged it for one more beautiful.    AMELIA (with violence). But my ring, I say, my ring?    FRANCIS. Even yours, Amelia. Ha! such a brilliant, and on my finger;  and from Amelia! Death itself should not have plucked it hence. It is  not the costliness of the diamond, not the cunning of the pattern--it is  love which constitutes its value. Is it not so, Amelia? Dearest child,  you are weeping. Woe be to him who causes such precious drops to flow  from those heavenly eyes; ah, and if you knew all, if you could but see  him yourself, see him under that form?    AMELIA. Monster! what do you mean? What form do you speak of?    FRANCIS. Hush, hush, gentle soul, press me no further (as if  soliloquizing, yet aloud). If it had only some veil, that horrid vice,  under which it might shroud itself from the eye of the world! But there  it is, glaring horribly through the sallow, leaden eye; proclaiming  itself in the sunken, deathlike look; ghastly protruding bones; the  faltering, hollow voice; preaching audibly from the shattered, shaking  skeleton; piercing to the most vital marrow of the bones, and sapping  the manly strength of youth--faugh! the idea sickens me. Nose, eyes,  ears shrink from it. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],[0,"Wilhelm Tell (#7)"],[1," like some precious treasure,  I locked it fast, and thought on deeds alone.  Through every winding of the hills I crept--  No valley so remote but I explored it;  Nay, even at the glacier's ice-clad base,  I sought and found the homes of living men;  And still, where'er my wandering footsteps turned,  The self-same hatred of these tyrants met me.  For even there, at vegetation's verge,  Where the numbed earth is barren of all fruits,  There grasping hands had been stretched forth for plunder.  Into the hearts of all this honest race,  The story of my wrongs struck deep, and now  They to a man are ours; both heart and hand.  Great things, indeed, you've wrought in little time.    MELCHTHAL.  I did still more than this. The fortresses,  Rossberg and Sarnen, are the country's dread;  For from behind their rocky walls the foe  Swoops, as the eagle from his eyrie, down,  And, safe himself, spreads havoc o'er the land.  With my own eyes I wished to weigh its strength,  So went to Sarnen, and explored the castle.    STAUFFACHER.  How! Risk thyself even in the tiger's den?    MELCHTHAL.  Disguised in pilgrim's weeds I entered it;  I saw the viceroy feasting at his board--  Judge if I'm master of myself or no!  I saw the tyrant, and I slew him not!    STAUFFACHER.  Fortune, indeed, has smiled upon your boldness.       [Meanwhile the others have arrived and join MELCHTHAL     and STAUFFACHER.    Yet tell me now, I pray, who are the friends,  The worthy men, who came along with you?  Make me acquainted with them, that we may  Speak frankly, man to man, and heart to heart.    MEYER.  In the three Cantons, who, sir, knows not you?  Meyer of Sarnen is my name; and this  Is Struth of Winkelried, my sister's son.    STAUFFACHER.  No unknown name. A Winkelried it was  Who slew the dragoon in the fen at Weiler,  And lost his life in the encounter, too.    WINKELRIED.  That, Master Stauffacher, was my grandfather.    MELCHTHAL (pointing to two peasants).  These two are men belonging to the convent  Of Engelberg, and live behind the forest.  You'll not think ill of them, because they're serfs,  And sit not free upon the soil, like us.  They love the land, and bear a good repute.    STAUFFACHER (to them).  Give me your hands. He has good cause for thanks,  That unto no man owes his body's service.  But worth is worth, no matter where 'tis found.    HUNN.  That is Herr Reding, sir, our old Landamman.    MEYER.  I know him well. There is a suit between us,  About a piece of ancient heritage.  Herr Reding, we are enemies in court,  Here we are one.       [Shakes his hand.    STAUFFACHER.           That's well and bravely said.    WINKELRIED.  Listen! They come. Hark to the horn of Uri!       [On the right and left armed men are seen descending     the rocks with torches.    MAUER.  Look, is not that God's pious servant there?  A worthy priest! The terrors of the night,  And the way's pains and perils scare not him,  A faithful shepherd caring for his flock.    BAUMGARTEN.  The Sacrist follows him, and Walter Fuerst.  But where is Tell? I do not see him there.       [WALTER FURST, ROSSELMANN the Pastor, PETERMANN the Sacrist,     KUONI the Shepherd, WERNI the huntsman, RUODI the Fisherman,     and five other countrymen, thirty-three in all, advance and     take their places round the fire.    FURST.  Thus must we, on the soil our fathers left us,  Creep forth by stealth to meet like murderers,  And in the night, that should their mantle lend  Only to crime and black conspiracy,  Assert our own good rights, which yet are clear  As is the radiance of the noonday sun.    MELCHTHAL.  So be it. What is woven in gloom of night  Shall free and boldly meet the morning light.    ROSSELMANN.  Confederates! listen to the words which God  Inspires my heart withal. Here we are met  To represent the general weal. In us  Are all the people of the land convened.  Then let us hold the Diet, as of old,  And as we're wont in peaceful times to do.  The time's necessity be our excuse  If there be aught informal in this meeting.  Still, wheresoe'er men strike for justice, there  Is God, and now beneath his heaven we stand.    STAUFFACHER.  'Tis well advised. Let us, then, hold the Diet  According to our ancient usages.  Though it be night there's sunshine in our cause.    MELCHTHAL.  Few though our numbers be, the hearts are here  Of the whole people; here the best are met.    HUNN.  The ancient books may not be near at hand,  Yet are they graven in our inmost hearts.    ROSSELMANN.  'Tis well. And now, then, let a ring be formed,  And plant the swords of power within the ground. [16]    MAUER.  Let the Landamman step into his place,  And by his side his secretaries stand.    SACRIST.  There are three Cantons here. Which hath the right  To give the head to the united council?  Schwytz may contest the dignity with Uri,  We Unterwaldeners enter not the field.    MELCHTHAL.  We stand aside. We are not suppliants here,  Invoking aid from our more potent friends.    STAUFFACHER.  Let Uri have the sword. Her banner takes  In battle the precedence of our own.    FURST.  Schwytz, then, must share the honor of the sword;  For she's the honored ancestor of all.    ROSSELMANN.  Let me arrange this generous controversy.  Uri shall lead in battle--Schwytz in council.    FURST (gives STAUFFACHER his hand).  Then take your place.    STAUFFACHER.              Not I. Some older man.    HOFE.  Ulrich, the smith, is the most aged here.    MAUER.  A worthy man, but he is not a freeman;  No bondman can be judge in Switzerland.    STAUFFACHER.  Is not Herr Reding here, our old Landamman?  Where can we find a worthier man than he?    FURST.  Let him be Amman and the Diet's chief?  You that agree with me hold up your hands!       [All hold up their right hands.    REDING (stepping into the centre).  I cannot lay my hands upon the books;  But by yon everlasting stars I swear  Never to swerve from justice and the right.       [The two swords are placed before him, and a circle formed;     Schwytz in the centre, Uri on his right, Unterwald on his left.    REDING (resting on his battle-sword).  Why, at the hour when spirits walk the earth,  Meet the three Cantons of the mountains here,  Upon the lake's inhospitable shore?  And what the purport of the new alliance  We here contract beneath the starry heaven?    STAUFFACHER (entering the circle).  No new alliance do we now contract,  But one our fathers framed, in ancient times,  We purpose to renew! For know, confederates,  Though mountain ridge and lake divide our bounds,  And every Canton's ruled by its own laws,  Yet are we but one race, born of one blood,  And all are children of one common home.    WINKELRIED.  Then is the burden of our legends true,  That we came hither from a distant land?  Oh, tell us what you know, that our new league  May reap fresh vigor from the leagues of old.    STAUFFACHER.  Hear, then, what aged herdsmen tell. There dwelt  A mighty people in the land that lies  Back to the north. The scourge of famine came;  And in this strait 'twas publicly resolved,  That each tenth man, on whom the lot might fall  Should leave the country. They obeyed--and forth,  With loud lamentings, men and women went,  A mighty host; and to the south moved on,  Cutting their way through Germany by the sword,  Until they gained that pine-clad hills of ours;  Nor stopped they ever on their forward course,  Till at the shaggy dell they halted, where  The Mueta flows through its luxuriant meads.  No trace of human creature met their eye,  Save one poor hut upon the desert shore,  Where dwelt a lonely man, and kept the ferry.  A tempest raged--the lake rose mountains high  And barred their further progress. Thereupon  They viewed the country; found it rich in wood,  Discovered goodly springs, and felt as they  Were in their own dear native land once more.  Then they resolved to settle on the spot;  Erected there the ancient town of Schwytz;  And many a day of toil had they to clear  The tangled brake and forest's spreading roots.  Meanwhile their numbers grew, the soil became  Unequal to sustain them, and they crossed  To the black mountain, far as Weissland, where,  Concealed behind eternal walls of ice,  Another people speak another tongue.  They built the village Stanz, beside the Kernwald  The village Altdorf, in the vale of Reuss;  Yet, ever mindful of their parent stem,  The men of Schwytz, from all the stranger race,  That since that time have settled in the land,  Each other recognize. Their hearts still know,  And beat fraternally to kindred blood.       [Extends his hand right and left.    MAUER.  Ay, we are all one heart, one blood, one race!    ALL (joining hands).  We are one people, and will act as one.    STAUFFACHER.  The nations round us bear a foreign yoke;  For they have yielded to the conqueror.  Nay, even within our frontiers may be found  Some that owe villein service to a lord,  A race of bonded serfs from sire to son.  But we, the genuine race of ancient Swiss,  Have kept our freedom from the first till now,  Never to princes have we bowed the knee;  Freely we sought protection of the empire.    ROSSELMANN.  Freely we sought it--freely it was given.  'Tis so set down in Emperor Frederick's charter.    STAUFFACHER.  For the most free have still some feudal lord.  There must be still a chief, a judge supreme,  To whom appeal may lie in case of strife.  And therefore was it that our sires allowed  For what they had recovered from the waste,  This honor to the emperor, the lord  Of all the German and Italian soil;  And, like the other freemen of his realm,  Engaged to aid him with their swords in war;  And this alone should be the freeman's duty,  To guard the empire that keeps guard for him.    MELCHTHAL.  He's but a slave that would acknowledge more.    STAUFFACHER.  They followed, when the Heribann [17] went forth,  The imperial standard, and they fought its battles!
