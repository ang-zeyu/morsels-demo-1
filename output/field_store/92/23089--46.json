He trembled as he saw the  hated swastika on its tail.    \"Will there be a scrap?\" he asked himself. Strangely enough he felt  quite cool about it. The Young Lord took the controls. The motors  roared. This gave Dave time to study land and sky. As near as he could  tell the other plane which was slowly circling, was just about over  Ramsey Farm. \"That's why Applegate is putting on such speed,\" he  thought.    Just then, like a squirrel darting for shelter, the enemy plane leapt  upward and into a cloud.    \"You better!\" Applegate growled, at the disappearing enemy.    Only when they were near the cloud did he slacken his speed. Then, like  a dog waiting for a squirrel, he loitered about in the sky.    \"If the enemy really wished to get away,\" Dave thought, \"every advantage  is with him.\" A whole string of clouds was drifting in from the distant  sea. Was he glad or sorry? At that moment he could not have told.    After a time, like a dog watching clumps of bushes where a rabbit is  hiding, the Young Lord began skirting that long procession of clouds.    They had followed almost to landsend and the shore when suddenly the  Young Lord pointed to a black speck against the distant sky. Dave heaved  a sigh of relief. Turning about, they headed for the airdrome.    \"He was bashful, that Hun,\" Applegate laughed into his mouthpiece.  \"Perhaps he came over to find his pals who paid us a visit yesterday.  Sorry to disappoint him. Even the wreck has been carted away.\"    \"One of his friends is still at large,\" Dave suggested. \"Might have set  up a signal. Black cross cut from the sod would do the trick.\"    \"That's right,\" Applegate agreed. \"Anyway,\" he laughed as they began  circling for a landing, \"we're back just in time for lunch. It's cold  beef and plum pudding. You'll stay, I hope.\"    \"Oh! Sure!\" Dave agreed.    His visit to the flying corps' mess was one not soon to be forgotten. He  had read magazine stories of these fighters. Loud, boisterous, wild and  a bit coarse, that was how they had been pictured. To his surprise he  found them a simple, kindly lot, with manners that would have put many a  college group to shame.    \"You've really got to be up to things to be a-flying in this squadron,\"  the Young Lord explained. \"And in any other, for that matter. Drinking,  loud laughs, roughness--well, it doesn't seem to go with life-and-death  flying, that's all.    \"You have to be a man,\" he added after a pause. \"And a man's nearly  always a gentleman as well.\"                                       _Chapter_ VIII                            Roll Out the Barrel      When late that afternoon Dave walked with Cherry to the village to catch  the bus to London, he carried a parcel under his arm. \"My hiking boots,\"  he explained. \"These hard roads have worn the soles thin.\"    \"Oh! I'm glad,\" Cherry exclaimed. \"You are going to like Uncle John.  He's our shoemaker. We call him that though I'm sure he's really uncle  to no one. He's very old and still does all his work the hard way, by  hand. Wonderful work it is, too.\"    Dave did like Uncle John. Seated there at his bench, a leather apron on  his lap and nails between his teeth, he seemed to have just moved out of  a very old story book.    \"Do you still make shoes as well as repair them?\" Dave asked.    \"Oh, yes, now and then.\" The old man's smile was good to see. \"I've made  all the Young Lord's shoes since he was a baby.    \"But then,\" he sighed, \"times have changed. You can't get the leather  any more. It used to be that I could make a pair of shoes and guarantee  them for five years. Those times are gone.    \"But perhaps it is best that it should be so,\" he added cheerfully.  \"Nowdays people like change. If you only pay one pound for a pair of  shoes, you can afford more than one pair.\" Taking a tack from his mouth,  he drove it home, then another.    \"He lives in two small rooms behind the shop,\" Cherry said when they  were outside. \"His little wife was just like him, always cheerful and  kind. She died three years ago.    \"Nearly all the people in the village are like that,\" she added as they  walked on. \"The butcher has his stall in front of his home. The baker's  shop is in his basement. So is the grocer's. Everyone works. All are  kindly. They never have much, but they make it do--and are happy.\"    Dave was to recall this picture with a sudden pull at his heartstrings  in the days that were to come.    The bus came lurching in. They climbed aboard and were away for London.    Arrived in London they hurried up to the radio studio for Cherry's  audition. Singing in a bare studio with a strange accompanist, the girl  was far from doing her best. For all that the director gave her a small  spot on the \"People's Choice\" program at 9:00 P. M.    Once more on the street where shadows had grown long and dark, and  people by hundreds were hastening home before the air raid siren  sounded, Cherry gripped Dave's arm as she said in a tragic whisper:  \"David, I never can stick it out. It will only be a dismal failure.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Dave laughed. \"It's only stage-fright. Come on. My uncle  took me to a rare little basement eating place once. They serve good old  American coffee and waffles with maple syrup. That will put you on your  toes.\"    In the quiet of the sub-cellar, they drank great quantities of coffee  and ate their waffles joyously.    \"I--I guess I'll make it now,\" Cherry murmured. Once more they were on  the deserted streets.    Then, as if to crush her high hopes, all hell let loose. The roar of  powerful motors, the scream of sirens, the boom and bang of  anti-aircraft guns filled all the night with terror.    \"I can't let you in 'ere now,\" said a burly guard at the entrance to the  broadcasting station. \"It is quite impossible. You shouldn't be 'ere at  all.\"    \"But this lady is to sing over the radio at nine!\" Dave protested.    \"Can't be 'elped.\" The guard was firm. \"Orders is orders. No ladies  hallowed in the station during an alarm. If you'd ask me sir, I'd  hadvise a subway station at once, sir. Yonder's one not 'alf a block  haway.\"    The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there came a low, whining  sound, followed by a flash that lit all the sky. Then came a roar fit to  burst their eardrums, and a tremendous push that tossed them to the  pavement five yards away.    Without a word Dave scrambled to his feet, picked the slight girl up in  his arms, dashed half a block, and was down two flights of stairs to the  subway station before he fully realized what he was doing.    Seated on the hard floor of the station, with thousands of people all  about them, for a full moment they were completely silent. Then Dave  began to laugh. Cherry joined in, and the spell was broken.    The laugh over, they looked about them. The whole long platform was  filled with people. Young and old, rich and poor, salesgirls in thin,  shabby coats, gray-haired ladies in mink and ermine, they all were  there. And all, it seemed, were bent on making the best of an unpleasant  situation. Bye and bye they would do their best to snatch a little  sleep, for tomorrow would be another day.    \"Look at them.\" There was a catch in Dave's throat. \"They seem almost  happy.\"    \"Yes.\" Cherry's chin went up. \"They're not going to let Hitler get them  down. He wouldn't be pleased if he could see them now!\"    In a bright corner four old men were playing cards. In the shadows a  shopgirl was whispering to her young man. Sitting on their bedrolls, two  sedate matrons were knitting. Children were everywhere, and all of them  whooping it up in hilarious fun.    \"Excuse me,\" said a smiling young lady. \"Aren't you Cherry Ramsey?\"    \"Why--why yes, I am.\" Cherry looked into a pair of eager blue eyes.    \"I knew it!\" the young lady exclaimed. \"I heard you sing at Lady  Applegate's home once. It was truly quite wonderful. Now--\" she  hesitated, \"well, you see, I'm just helping out down here, sort of  social service work, don't you know. And I thought you might not mind,  well, you know,\"--she hesitated--\"well, perhaps you wouldn't mind  singing a song or two for these people. They'd think it quite the  berries if you would.\"    \"Well, that--\" Cherry laughed, \"that's what I came to town for, to sing  on the radio. But the guard wouldn't let us go up to the station.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder,\" Miss Meeks, the social worker murmured. \"Listen!\"  There came a deep, low rumble like the roll of distant thunder. \"You  can't help loving these people, don't you know.\" Her tired face  brightened as she spread out her arms. \"Not one of them knows whether  his home will be standing in the morning. But you see how they are.\"    \"Yes--yes I see.\" Cherry swallowed hard.    \"The radio,\" Miss Meeks murmured. \"Now I shouldn't wonder. Will you sing  for them, Miss Ramsey?\"    Cherry nodded.    From somewhere a small piano was made to appear. A little Irish girl  with a tumbled mass of red hair took her place before it. A small  platform--a heavy packing box--was placed beside the piano.    After shedding her heavy coat, Cherry stood before her strange audience.  All lovely in gold and blue, she caught their eyes at once. Leaning  over, she whispered to the girl at the piano, giving her the name of her  first song. The social worker clapped her hands for silence. Deep,  appreciative silence followed.    \"Miss Ramsey, a friend of Lady Applegate, from Dorset way, will sing to  us,\" Miss Meeks announced. \"Let's give her a hand.\" The applause was  tumultuous.    Somehow, a light, not too strong, was made to play on the slender girl  as she sang.      \"In the gloaming, Oh my darling,    When the lights are dim and low.\"    She sang the song through to the end. The applause that followed drowned  out the sound of exploding bombs.    \"More! More!\" came from every corner.    The social worker slid a microphone before the singer. Bending over, a  smile on her lips, Cherry once more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#7)"],[1,"by  the king's orders broke into the church, dragged them from the foot of  the altar, and beheaded them outside.    The news of the issue of the fatal battle of Tewkesbury, the capture of  the queen, and the death of the prince, was borne to Exeter by fugitives  on the following day. Beyond the fact that the Earl of Devon and other  nobles were known to have been killed, and Somerset with a party of  knights had taken sanctuary, they could give no details as to the fate  of individuals. In the deepest distress at the utter ruin of the cause,  and in ignorance of the fate of her husband, who she could only hope was  one of those who had gained sanctuary, Dame Tresham prepared for flight.  This accomplished, she had only to wait, and sit in tearless anguish at  the window, listening intently whenever a horseman rode past. All night  her watch continued. Gervaise, who had cried himself to sleep, lay on  a couch beside her. Morning dawned, and she then knew that her husband  would not come, for had he escaped from the field he would long ere this  have been with her. The messenger with the news had arrived at eight the  previous morning, and, faithful to her husband's wishes, at that hour  she ordered the horses to be brought round, and, joining a party  of gentlemen who were also making for the coast, rode with them to  Plymouth. Arrangements were at once made with the captain of a small  ship in the port, and two days later they landed at Honfleur, where  Sir Thomas had enjoined his wife to wait until she heard from him or  obtained sure news of his fate.    A week after her arrival the news was brought by other fugitives of the  violation of the sanctuary by the king, and the murder of Somerset and  the gentlemen with him, of whom Sir Thomas Tresham was known to have  been one.    The blow proved fatal to Dame Tresham. She had gone through many trials  and misfortunes, and had ever borne them bravely, but the loss of her  husband completely broke her down. Save to see his wishes concerning  their son carried out, she had no longer any interest in life or any  wish to live. But until the future of Gervaise was assured, her mission  was unfulfilled. His education was her sole care; his mornings were  spent at a monastery, where the monks instructed the sons of such of the  nobles and gentry of the neighbourhood as cared that they should be able  to read and write. In the afternoon he had the best masters in the town  in military exercises. His evenings he spent with his mother, who strove  to instill in him the virtues of patience, mercy to the vanquished, and  valour, by stories of the great characters of history. She herself spent  her days in pious exercises, in attending the services of the Church,  and in acts of charity and kindness to her poorer neighbours. But her  strength failed rapidly, and she was but a shadow of her former self  when, two years and a half after her arrival at Honfleur, she felt that  if she was herself to hand Gervaise over to the Order of St. John, she  must no longer delay. Accordingly she took ship to London, and landing  there made her way with him to the dwelling of the Order at Clerkenwell.  It was in process of rebuilding, for in 1381 it had been first plundered  and then burned by the insurgents under Wat Tyler. During the ninety  years that had elapsed since that event the work of rebuilding had  proceeded steadily, each grand prior making additions to the pile which,  although not yet fully completed, was already one of the grandest and  stateliest abodes in England.    On inquiring for the grand prior, and stating that she had a letter  of importance for him, Dame Tresham and her son were shown up to his  apartment, and on entering were kindly and courteously received by him  when informed that she was the widow of the late Sir Thomas Tresham.    \"I am the bearer of a letter for you, given into my hand by my husband's  dear friend your predecessor,\" she said, \"a few days before his murder  at Tewkesbury. It relates to my son here.\"    The grand prior opened the letter and read it.    \"Assuredly, madam, I will carry out the wishes here expressed,\" he said.  \"They are, that I should forward at once the letter he has given you to  Sir Peter D'Aubusson, and that until an answer is received from him, I  should take care of the boy here, and see that he is instructed in all  that is needful for a future knight of our Order. I grieve to see that  you yourself are looking so ill.\"    \"My course is well nigh run,\" she said. \"I have, methinks, but a few  days to live. I am thankful that it has been permitted to me to carry  out my husband's wishes, and to place my boy in your hands. That done,  my work on earth is finished, and glad indeed am I that the time is at  hand when I can rejoin my dear husband.\"    \"We have a building here where we can lodge ladies in distress or need,  Dame Tresham, and trust that you will take up your abode there.\"    \"I shall indeed be thankful to do so,\" she replied. \"I know no one in  London, and few would care to lodge a dying woman.\"    \"We are Hospitallers,\" the grand prior said. \"That was our sole mission  when we were first founded, and before we became a military order, and  it is still a part of our sworn duty to aid the distressed.\"    A few minutes later Dame Tresham was conducted to a comfortable  apartment, and was given into the charge of a female attendant. The next  day she had another interview with the grand prior, to whom she handed  over her jewels and remaining money. This she prayed him to devote to  the furnishing of the necessary outfit for Gervaise. She spent the rest  of the day in the church of the hospital, had a long talk with her son  in the evening, giving him her last charges as to his future life and  conduct, and that night, as if she had now fulfilled her last duty on  earth, she passed away, and was found by her attendant lying with a look  of joy and peacefulness on her dead face.    Gervaise's grief was for a time excessive. He was nearly twelve years  old, and had never until now been separated from her even for a day. She  had often spoken to him of her end being near, but until the blow came  he had never quite understood that it could be so. She had, on the night  before her death, told him that he must not grieve overmuch for her, for  that in any case they must have soon been sundered, and that it was  far better that he should think of her as at rest, and happy, than as  leading a lonely and sorrowful life.    The grand prior, however, wisely gave him but little time to dwell upon  his loss, but as soon as her funeral had taken place, handed him over  to the knights who had the charge of the novices on probation, and  instructed them in their military exercises, and of the chaplain who  taught them such learning as was considered requisite for a knight of  the Order.    The knights were surprised at the proficiency the lad had already  attained in the use of his weapons.    \"By St. Agatha,\" one of them exclaimed, after the conclusion of his  first lesson, \"you have had good teachers, lad, and have availed  yourself rarely of them. If you go on like this you will become a  distinguished knight of our Order. With a few more years to strengthen  your arms I warrant me you will bear your part well in your first tussle  with the Moslem corsairs.\"    It fortunately happened that a party of knights were starting for Rhodes  a few days after the admission of Gervaise to the Hospital, and the  letter to Sir Peter D'Aubusson was committed to their charge. They were  to proceed to Bordeaux by ship, then to journey by land to Marseilles,  and thence, being joined by some French knights, to sail direct to  Rhodes. Two months later an answer was received. D'Aubusson wrote to the  grand prior saying that he would gladly carry out the last wishes of his  dead friend, and that he had already obtained from the grand master the  appointment of Gervaise Tresham as one of his pages, and begged that he  might be sent out with the next party of knights leaving England. It  was three months before such an opportunity occurred. During that time  Gervaise remained at the house of St. John's studying diligently, and  continuing his military exercises. These were severe; for the scions of  noble houses, who hoped some day to distinguish themselves as knights,  were put through many gymnastic exercises--were taught to spring on to  a horse when clad in full armour, to wield heavy battleaxes, to run and  climb, and to prepare themselves for all the possibilities of the mode  of fighting of the day.    Gervaise gained the encomiums, not only of his special preceptor, but of  the various knights in the house, and of the grand prior himself, both  for his strength and activity, and for the earnestness with which he  worked. When the time approached for his leaving England, the grand  prior ordered for him the outfit which would be necessary in his  position as a page of the grand master. The dresses were numerous and  rich, for although the knights of St. John wore over their armour the  simple mantle of their order, which was a sleeveless garment of black  relieved only by a white cross on the chest, they indulged in the finest  and most costly armour, and in rich garments beneath their black mantles  when not in armour.    \"I am well pleased with you, Gervaise,\" the grand prior said, on the  evening before he was to leave, \"and I see in you the making of a  valiant knight of the Order. Maintain the same spirit you have shown  here; be obedient and reverent to your superiors; give your whole mind  to your duties; strive earnestly during the three or four years that  your pagedom will last, to perfect yourself in military exercises, that  when the time comes for you to buckle on armour you will be able to bear  yourself worthily. Remember that you will have to win your knighthood,  for the Order does not bestow this honour, and you"]]]
