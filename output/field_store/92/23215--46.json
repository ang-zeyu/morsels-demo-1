Two words are well known for it, _hati_ and _ah;_ and as it  is unlikely that these should be mere synonyms, we have a presumption  that one of them does not mean the physical heart, but rather the mental  heart. We are accustomed to the same mixture of thought; and far the  more common usage in English is not to employ the name to express the  physical heart, but for the will, as when we say \"good-hearted\";--for  the spring of action, \"broken-hearted \";--for the feelings,  \"hard-hearted\";--for the passions, \"an affair of the heart\";--or for the  vigour, as when a man in nature or in act is \"hearty\" The Egyptian, with  his metaphysical mind, took two different words where we only use one;  and when we read of placing the heart _(hati)_ out of a man, we are led  at once by the analogy of beliefs in other races to understand this as  the vitality or soul. In the \"Golden Bough\" Mr. Frazer has explained  this part of natural metaphysics; and in this, and the following points,  I freely quote from that work as a convenient text-book. The soul or  vitality of a man is thought of as separable from the body at will, and  therefore communicable to other objects or positions. In those positions  it cannot be harmed by what happens to the body, which is therefore  deathless for the time. But if the external seat of the soul be attacked  or destroyed, the man immediately dies. This is illustrated from the  Norse, Saxons, Celts, Italians, Greeks, Kabyles, Arabs, Hindus, Malays,  Mongolians, Tartars, Magyars, and Slavonians. It may well, then, be  considered as a piece of inherent psychology: and following this  interpretation, I have rendered \"heart\" in this sense \"soul\" in the  translation.    The Nine Gods who meet Bata are one of the great cycles of divinities,  which were differently reckoned in various places. Khnumu is always the  formative god, who makes man upon the potter's wheel, as in the scene in  the temple of Luqsor. And even in natural birth it was Khnumu who \"gave  strength to the limbs,\" as in the earlier \"Tales of the Magicians.\" The  character of the wife of Bata is a very curious study. The total absence  of the affections in her was probably designed as in accord with her  non-natural formation, as she could not inherit aught from human  parents. Ambition appears as the only emotion of this being; her attacks  on the transformations of Bata are not due to dislike, but only to fear  that he should claim her removal from her high station; she \"feared  exceedingly for the words that her husband had spoken to her.\" Her  Lilith nature is incapable of any craving but that for power.    The action here of the seven Hathors we have noticed in the remarks on  the previous tale of the Doomed Prince. The episode of the sea is very  strange; and if we need find some rationalising account of it, we might  suppose it to be a mythical form of a raid of pirates, who, not catching  the woman, carried off something of hers, which proved an object of  contention in Egypt. But such renderings are unlikely, and we may the  rather expect to find some explanation in a mythological parallel.    The carrying of the lock of hair to Pharaoh, and his proclaiming a  search for the owner, is plainly an early form of the story of the  little slipper, whose owner is sought by the king. The point that she  could not be caught except by setting another woman to tempt her with  ornaments, anticipates the modern novelist's saying, \"Set a woman to  catch a woman.\"    The sudden death of Bata, so soon as the depository of his soul was  destroyed, is a usual feature in such tales about souls. But it is only  in the Indian forms quoted by Mr. Frazer that there is any revival of  the dead; and in no case is there any transformation like that of Bata.  Perhaps none but an Egyptian or a Chinese would have credited Anpu with  wandering up and down for four years seeking the lost soul. But the idea  of returning the soul in water to the man is found as a magic process in  North America (\"Golden Bough,\" i. 141).    The first transformation of Bata, into a bull, is clearly drawn from the  Apis bull of Memphis. The rejoicings at discovering a real successor of  Apis are here, the rejoicings over Bata, who is the Apis bull,  distinguished as he says by \"bearing every good mark.\" These marks on  the back and other parts were the tokens of the true Apis, who was  sought for anxiously through the country on the death of the sacred  animal who had lived in the sanctuary. The man who, like Anpu, brought  up a true Apis to the temple would receive great rewards and honours.    The scene where the princess demands the grant of a favour is repeated  over again by Esther at her banquet, and by the daughter of Herodias. It  is the Oriental way of doing business. But the curious incongruity of  making a great feast with offerings to the ox before sacrificing it,  appears inexplicable until we note the habits of other peoples in  slaying their sacred animals at certain intervals. This tale shows us  what is stated by Greek authors, that the Egyptians slew the sacred Apis  at stated times, or when a new one was discovered with the right marks.  The annual sacrifice of a sacred ram at Thebes shows that the Egyptians  were familiar with such an idea. And though it was considered by the  writer of this tale as a monstrous act, yet the offerings and festivity  which accompanied it are in accordance with the strange fact found by  Mariette, that in the three undisturbed Apis burials which he discovered  there were only fragments of bone, and in one case a head, carefully  embalmed with bitumen and magnificent offerings of jewellery. The divine  Apis was eaten as a sacred feast.    The reason that the princess desires the liver is strangely explained by  a present belief on the Upper Nile. The Darfuris think that the liver is  the seat of the soul (\"Golden Bough,\" ii. 88); and hence if she ate the  liver she would destroy the soul of Bata, or prevent it entering any  other incarnation.    The next detail is also curiously significant. If a bull was being  sacrificed we should naturally suppose the blood would flow, and that a  few drops would not be noticed. Here, however, two drops are said to  fall, and this was when the bull \"was upon the shoulders of the people.\"  Now it is a very general idea that blood must not be allowed to fall  upon the ground; the eastern and southern Africans will not shed the  blood of cattle (\"Golden Bough,\" i. 182); and strangely the Australians  avoid the falling of blood to the ground by placing the bleeding persons  upon the shoulders of other men. This parallel is so close to the  Egyptian tale that it seems as if the bull was borne \"on the shoulders  of the people,\" that his blood should not fall to the ground; yet in  spite of this precaution \"he shook his neck, and he threw two drops of  blood over against the doors of his majesty.\" In these drops of blood  was the soul of Bata, in spite of the princess having eaten his liver;  and we know how among Jews, Arabs, and other peoples, the blood is  regarded as the vehicle of the soul or life.    The evidence of tree worship is plainer here than perhaps in any other  passage of Egyptian literature. The people rejoice for the two Persea  trees, \"and there were offerings made to them.\"    The blue crown worn by the king was the war cap of leather covered with  scales of copper: it is often found made in dark blue glaze for  statuettes, and it seems probable that the copper was superficially  sulphurised to tint it. Such head-dress was usually worn by kings when  riding in their chariots. The pale gold or electrum here mentioned was  the general material for decorating the royal chariot.    The miraculous birth of Bata in his third transformation is, as we have  noticed, closely paralleled by the birth of Atys from the almond. The  idea at the root of this is that of self-creation or self-existence, as  in the usual Egyptian phrase, \"bull of his mother.\"    The king flying up to heaven is a regular expression for his death: \"the  hawk has soared,\" \"the follower of the god has met his maker,\" so  Sanehat describes it (see ist series, pp. 97, 98).    This hawk-form of the king may be connected with the hawk bearing the  double crown which is perched on the top of the _ka_ name of each king.  That hawk is not Horus, nor even the king deified as Horus, because the  emblem of life is given to it by other gods (as by Set on a lintel of  XVIIIth Dynasty from Nubt), and therefore the hawk is the human king who  could perish, and not an immortal divinity. Further, this hawk-king is  always perched on the top of the drawing of the doorway to the sepulchre  which bears the _ka_ name of the king; and when we see the drawings of  the _ba_ bird or soul flying down the well to the sepulchre, it appears  as if the hawk were the royal _ba_ bird (ordinary men having a _ba_ bird  with a human head); and that the well-known first title of each king  represents the royal soul or _ba_ bird perched on the door of the  sepulchre, resting on his way to and from the visit to the corpse below.  The soul or _ba_ of the king at his death thus flew away as a hawk to  meet the sun.    The veil drawn over the fate of the inhuman princess is well conceived.  That she should die a sharp death has been foretold; but how Bata should  slay the divine creation--his wife--his mother--is a matter that the  scribe reserves in silence; we only read that \"he judged with her before  him, and the great nobles agreed with him.\" That judgment is best left  among the things unwritten.    The strange manner in which we can see incident after incident in the  latter part of the tale, each to refer to some ceremony or belief, even  imperfect as our knowledge of such must be, and the evidence that the  whole being of Bata is a transference of the myth of Atys, must lead us  to look on this, the marvellous portion, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#7)"],[1,"accused of  contributing to the _Police News_.    \"Of course not, of course not,\" said Mr. Wain hurriedly. \"Of course  not. I don't know why I asked. All this is very unsettling. What are  you doing here?\"    \"Thought I heard a noise, please, sir.\"    \"A noise?\"    \"A row, sir.\"    If it was Mr. Wain's wish that he should spend the night playing Massa  Tambo to his Massa Bones, it was not for him to baulk the house-master's  innocent pleasure. He was prepared to continue the snappy dialogue till  breakfast time.    \"I think there must have been a burglar in here, Jackson.\"    \"Looks like it, sir.\"    \"I found the window open.\"    \"He's probably in the garden, sir.\"    Mr. Wain looked out into the garden with an annoyed expression, as if  its behaviour in letting burglars be in it struck him as unworthy of a  respectable garden.    \"He might be still in the house,\" said Mr. Wain, ruminatively.    \"Not likely, sir.\"    \"You think not?\"    \"Wouldn't be such a fool, sir. I mean, such an ass, sir.\"    \"Perhaps you are right, Jackson.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder if he was hiding in the shrubbery, sir.\"    Mr. Wain looked at the shrubbery, as who should say, _\"Et tu,  Brute!\"_    \"By Jove! I think I see him,\" cried Mike. He ran to the window, and  vaulted through it on to the lawn. An inarticulate protest from Mr.  Wain, rendered speechless by this move just as he had been beginning  to recover his faculties, and he was running across the lawn into the  shrubbery. He felt that all was well. There might be a bit of a row on  his return, but he could always plead overwhelming excitement.    Wyatt was round at the back somewhere, and the problem was how to get  back without being seen from the dining-room window. Fortunately a  belt of evergreens ran along the path right up to the house. Mike  worked his way cautiously through these till he was out of sight, then  tore for the regions at the back.    The moon had gone behind the clouds, and it was not easy to find a way  through the bushes. Twice branches sprang out from nowhere, and hit  Mike smartly over the shins, eliciting sharp howls of pain.    On the second of these occasions a low voice spoke from somewhere on  his right.    \"Who on earth's that?\" it said.    Mike stopped.    \"Is that you, Wyatt? I say----\"    \"Jackson!\"    The moon came out again, and Mike saw Wyatt clearly. His knees were  covered with mould. He had evidently been crouching in the bushes on  all fours.    \"You young ass,\" said Wyatt. \"You promised me that you wouldn't get  out.\"    \"Yes, I know, but----\"    \"I heard you crashing through the shrubbery like a hundred elephants.  If you _must_ get out at night and chance being sacked, you might  at least have the sense to walk quietly.\"    \"Yes, but you don't understand.\"    And Mike rapidly explained the situation.    \"But how the dickens did he hear you, if you were in the dining-room?\"  asked Wyatt. \"It's miles from his bedroom. You must tread like a  policeman.\"    \"It wasn't that. The thing was, you see, it was rather a rotten thing  to do, I suppose, but I turned on the gramophone.\"    \"You--_what?_\"    \"The gramophone. It started playing 'The Quaint Old Bird.' Ripping it  was, till Wain came along.\"    Wyatt doubled up with noiseless laughter.    \"You're a genius,\" he said. \"I never saw such a man. Well, what's the  game now? What's the idea?\"    \"I think you'd better nip back along the wall and in through the  window, and I'll go back to the dining-room. Then it'll be all right  if Wain comes and looks into the dorm. Or, if you like, you might come  down too, as if you'd just woke up and thought you'd heard a row.\"    \"That's not a bad idea. All right. You dash along then. I'll get  back.\"    Mr. Wain was still in the dining-room, drinking in the beauties of the  summer night through the open window. He gibbered slightly when Mike  reappeared.    \"Jackson! What do you mean by running about outside the house in this  way! I shall punish you very heavily. I shall certainly report the  matter to the headmaster. I will not have boys rushing about the  garden in their pyjamas. You will catch an exceedingly bad cold. You  will do me two hundred lines, Latin and English. Exceedingly so. I  will not have it. Did you not hear me call to you?\"    \"Please, sir, so excited,\" said Mike, standing outside with his hands  on the sill.    \"You have no business to be excited. I will not have it. It is  exceedingly impertinent of you.\"    \"Please, sir, may I come in?\"    \"Come in! Of course, come in. Have you no sense, boy? You are laying  the seeds of a bad cold. Come in at once.\"    Mike clambered through the window.    \"I couldn't find him, sir. He must have got out of the garden.\"    \"Undoubtedly,\" said Mr. Wain. \"Undoubtedly so. It was very wrong of  you to search for him. You have been seriously injured. Exceedingly  so\"    He was about to say more on the subject when Wyatt strolled into the  room. Wyatt wore the rather dazed expression of one who has been  aroused from deep sleep. He yawned before he spoke.    \"I thought I heard a noise, sir,\" he said.    He called Mr. Wain \"father\" in private, \"sir\" in public. The presence  of Mike made this a public occasion.    \"Has there been a burglary?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mike, \"only he has got away.\"    \"Shall I go out into the garden, and have a look round, sir?\" asked  Wyatt helpfully.    The question stung Mr. Wain into active eruption once more.    \"Under no circumstances whatever,\" he said excitedly. \"Stay where you  are, James. I will not have boys running about my garden at night. It  is preposterous. Inordinately so. Both of you go to bed immediately. I  shall not speak to you again on this subject. I must be obeyed  instantly. You hear me, Jackson? James, you understand me? To bed at  once. And, if I find you outside your dormitory again to-night, you  will both be punished with extreme severity. I will not have this lax  and reckless behaviour.\"    \"But the burglar, sir?\" said Wyatt.    \"We might catch him, sir,\" said Mike.    Mr. Wain's manner changed to a slow and stately sarcasm, in much the  same way as a motor-car changes from the top speed to its first.    \"I was under the impression,\" he said, in the heavy way almost  invariably affected by weak masters in their dealings with the  obstreperous, \"I was distinctly under the impression that I had  ordered you to retire immediately to your dormitory. It is possible  that you mistook my meaning. In that case I shall be happy to repeat  what I said. It is also in my mind that I threatened to punish you  with the utmost severity if you did not retire at once. In these  circumstances, James--and you, Jackson--you will doubtless see the  necessity of complying with my wishes.\"    They made it so.          CHAPTER VII    IN WHICH MIKE IS DISCUSSED      Trevor and Clowes, of Donaldson's, were sitting in their study a week  after the gramophone incident, preparatory to going on the river. At  least Trevor was in the study, getting tea ready. Clowes was on the  window-sill, one leg in the room, the other outside, hanging over  space. He loved to sit in this attitude, watching some one else work,  and giving his views on life to whoever would listen to them. Clowes  was tall, and looked sad, which he was not. Trevor was shorter, and  very much in earnest over all that he did. On the present occasion he  was measuring out tea with a concentration worthy of a general  planning a campaign.    \"One for the pot,\" said Clowes.    \"All right,\" breathed Trevor. \"Come and help, you slacker.\"    \"Too busy.\"    \"You aren't doing a stroke.\"    \"My lad, I'm thinking of Life. That's a thing you couldn't do. I often  say to people, 'Good chap, Trevor, but can't think of Life. Give him a  tea-pot and half a pound of butter to mess about with,' I say, 'and  he's all right. But when it comes to deep thought, where is he? Among  the also-rans.' That's what I say.\"    \"Silly ass,\" said Trevor, slicing bread. \"What particular rot were you  thinking about just then? What fun it was sitting back and watching  other fellows work, I should think.\"    \"My mind at the moment,\" said Clowes, \"was tensely occupied with the  problem of brothers at school. Have you got any brothers, Trevor?\"    \"One. Couple of years younger than me. I say, we shall want some more  jam to-morrow. Better order it to-day.\"    \"See it done, Tigellinus, as our old pal Nero used to remark. Where is  he? Your brother, I mean.\"    \"Marlborough.\"    \"That shows your sense. I have always had a high opinion of your  sense, Trevor. If you'd been a silly ass, you'd have let your people  send him here.\"    \"Why not? Shouldn't have minded.\"    \"I withdraw what I said about your sense. Consider it unsaid. I have a  brother myself. Aged fifteen. Not a bad chap in his way. Like the  heroes of the school stories. 'Big blue eyes literally bubbling over  with fun.' At least, I suppose it's fun to him. Cheek's what I call  it. My people wanted to send him here. I lodged a protest. I said,  'One Clowes is ample for any public school.'\"    \"You were right there,\" said Trevor.    \"I said, 'One Clowes is luxury, two excess.' I pointed out that I was  just on the verge of becoming rather a blood at Wrykyn, and that I  didn't want the work of years spoiled by a brother who would think it  a rag to tell fellows who respected and admired me----\"    \"Such as who?\"    \"----Anecdotes of a chequered infancy. There are stories about me  which only my brother knows. Did I want them spread about the school?  No, laddie, I did not. Hence, we see my brother two terms ago, packing  up his little box, and tooling off to Rugby. And here am I at Wrykyn,  with an unstained reputation, loved by all who know me, revered by all  who don't; courted by boys, fawned upon by masters. People's faces  brighten when I throw them a nod. If I frown----\"    \"Oh, come on,\" said Trevor.    Bread and jam and cake monopolised Clowes's attention for the next  quarter"]]]
