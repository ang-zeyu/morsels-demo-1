Sure, these are no spirits, but the true substantial       bodies of those two deceased princes.            [Exeunt Spirits.]         FAUSTUS. Wilt please your highness now to send for the knight       that was so pleasant with me here of late?         EMPEROR. One of you call him forth.            [Exit ATTENDANT.]              Re-enter the KNIGHT with a pair of horns on his head.         How now, sir knight! why, I had thought thou hadst been a bachelor,       but now I see thou hast a wife, that not only gives thee horns,       but makes thee wear them.  Feel on thy head.         KNIGHT. Thou damned wretch and execrable dog,       Bred in the concave of some monstrous rock,       How dar'st thou thus abuse a gentleman?       Villain, I say, undo what thou hast done!         FAUSTUS. O, not so fast, sir! there's no haste:  but, good, are       you remembered how you crossed me in my conference with the       Emperor?  I think I have met with you for it.         EMPEROR. Good Master Doctor, at my entreaty release him:  he hath       done penance sufficient.         FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, not so much for the injury he offered       me here in your presence, as to delight you with some mirth, hath       Faustus worthily requited this injurious knight; which being all       I desire, I am content to release him of his horns:--and,       sir knight, hereafter speak well of scholars.--Mephistophilis,       transform him straight.[138]  [MEPHISTOPHILIS removes the horns.]       --Now, my good lord, having done my duty, I humbly take my leave.         EMPEROR. Farewell, Master Doctor:  yet, ere you go,       Expect from me a bounteous reward.            [Exeunt EMPEROR, KNIGHT, and ATTENDANTS.]         FAUSTUS. Now, Mephistophilis,[139] the restless course       That time doth run with calm and silent foot,       Shortening my days and thread of vital life,       Calls for the payment of my latest years:       Therefore, sweet Mephistophilis, let us       Make haste to Wertenberg.         MEPHIST. What, will you go on horse-back or on foot[?]         FAUSTUS. Nay, till I'm past this fair and pleasant green,       I'll walk on foot.              Enter a HORSE-COURSER.[140]         HORSE-COURSER. I have been all this day seeking one Master Fustian:       mass, see where he is!--God save you, Master Doctor!         FAUSTUS. What, horse-courser! you are well met.         HORSE-COURSER. Do you hear, sir?  I have brought you forty dollars       for your horse.         FAUSTUS. I cannot sell him so:  if thou likest him for fifty, take       him.         HORSE-COURSER. Alas, sir, I have no more!--I pray you, speak for       me.         MEPHIST. I pray you, let him have him:  he is an honest fellow,       and he has a great charge, neither wife nor child.         FAUSTUS. Well, come, give me your money [HORSE-COURSER gives       FAUSTUS the money]:  my boy will deliver him to you.  But I must       tell you one thing before you have him; ride him not into the       water, at any hand.         HORSE-COURSER. Why, sir, will he not drink of all waters?         FAUSTUS. O, yes, he will drink of all waters; but ride him not       into the water:  ride him over hedge or ditch, or where thou wilt,       but not into the water.         HORSE-COURSER. Well, sir.--Now am I made man for ever:  I'll not       leave my horse for forty:[141]  if he had but the quality of       hey-ding-ding, hey-ding-ding, I'd make a brave living on him:       he has a buttock as slick as an eel [Aside].--Well, God b'wi'ye,       sir:  your boy will deliver him me:  but, hark you, sir; if my horse       be sick or ill at ease, if I bring his water to you, you'll tell       me what it is?         FAUSTUS. Away, you villain! what, dost think I am a horse-doctor?            [Exit HORSE-COURSER.]         What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemn'd to die?       Thy fatal time doth draw to final end;       Despair doth drive distrust into[142] my thoughts:       Confound these passions with a quiet sleep:       Tush, Christ did call the thief upon the Cross;       Then rest thee, Faustus, quiet in conceit.            [Sleeps in his chair.]              Re-enter HORSE-COURSER, all wet, crying.         HORSE-COURSER. Alas, alas!  Doctor Fustian, quoth a? mass, Doctor       Lopus[143] was never such a doctor:  has given me a purgation, has       purged me of forty dollars; I shall never see them more.  But yet,       like an ass as I was, I would not be ruled by him, for he bade me       I should ride him into no water:  now I, thinking my horse had had       some rare quality that he would not have had me know of,[144] I,       like a venturous youth, rid him into the deep pond at the town's       end.  I was no sooner in the middle of the pond, but my horse       vanished away, and I sat upon a bottle of hay, never so near       drowning in my life.  But I'll seek out my doctor, and have my       forty dollars again, or I'll make it the dearest horse!--O,       yonder is his snipper-snapper.--Do you hear? you, hey-pass,[145]       where's your master?         MEPHIST. Why, sir, what would you? you cannot speak with him.         HORSE-COURSER. But I will speak with him.         MEPHIST. Why, he's fast asleep:  come some other time.         HORSE-COURSER. I'll speak with him now, or I'll break his       glass-windows about his ears.         MEPHIST. I tell thee, he has not slept this eight nights.         HORSE-COURSER. An he have not slept this eight weeks, I'll       speak with him.         MEPHIST. See, where he is, fast asleep.         HORSE-COURSER. Ay, this is he.--God save you, Master Doctor,       Master Doctor, Master Doctor Fustian! forty dollars, forty dollars       for a bottle of hay!         MEPHIST. Why, thou seest he hears thee not.         HORSE-COURSER. So-ho, ho! so-ho, ho!  [Hollows in his ear.]  No,       will you not wake?  I'll make you wake ere I go.  [Pulls FAUSTUS       by the leg, and pulls it away.]  Alas, I am undone! what shall       I do?         FAUSTUS. O, my leg, my leg!--Help, Mephistophilis! call the       officers.--My leg, my leg!         MEPHIST. Come, villain, to the constable.         HORSE-COURSER. O Lord, sir, let me go, and I'll give you forty       dollars more!         MEPHIST. Where be they?         HORSE-COURSER. I have none about me:  come to my ostry,[146]       and I'll give them you.         MEPHIST. Be gone quickly.            [HORSE-COURSER runs away.]         FAUSTUS. What, is he gone? farewell he!  Faustus has his leg again,       and the Horse-courser, I take it, a bottle of hay for his labour:       well, this trick shall cost him forty dollars more.              Enter WAGNER.         How now, Wagner! what's the news with thee?         WAGNER. Sir, the Duke of Vanholt doth earnestly entreat your       company.         FAUSTUS. The Duke of Vanholt! an honourable gentleman, to whom       I must be no niggard of my cunning.[147]--Come, Mephistophilis,       let's away to him.            [Exeunt.]              Enter the DUKE OF VANHOLT, the DUCHESS, and FAUSTUS.[148]         DUKE. Believe me, Master Doctor, this merriment hath much pleased       me.         FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, I am glad it contents you so well.       --But it may be, madam, you take no delight in this.  I have heard       that great-bellied women do long for some dainties or other:  what       is it, madam? tell me, and you shall have it.         DUCHESS. Thanks, good Master Doctor:  and, for I see your courteous       intent to pleasure me, I will not hide from you the thing my heart       desires; and, were it now summer, as it is January and the dead       time of the winter, I would desire no better meat than a dish       of ripe grapes.         FAUSTUS. Alas, madam, that's nothing!--Mephistophilis, be gone.       [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.] Were it a greater thing than this, so it       would content you, you should have it.              Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with grapes.         Here they be, madam:  wilt please you taste on them?         DUKE. Believe me, Master Doctor, this makes me wonder above the       rest, that being in the dead time of winter and in the month of       January, how you should come by these grapes.         FAUSTUS. If it like your grace, the year is divided into two       circles over the whole world, that, when it is here winter with       us, in the contrary circle it is summer with them, as in India,       Saba,[149] and farther countries in the east; and by means of a       swift spirit that I have, I had them brought hither, as you see.       --How do you like them, madam? be they good?         DUCHESS. Believe me, Master Doctor, they be the best grapes that       e'er I tasted in my life before.         FAUSTUS. I am glad they content you so, madam.         DUKE. Come, madam, let us in, where you must well reward this       learned man for the great kindness he hath shewed to you.         DUCHESS. And so I will, my lord; and, whilst I live, rest       beholding[150] for this courtesy.         FAUSTUS. I humbly thank your grace.         DUKE. Come, Master Doctor, follow us, and receive your reward.            [Exeunt.]              Enter WAGNER.[151]         WAGNER. I think my master means to die shortly,       For he hath given to me all his goods:[152]       And yet, methinks, if that death were near,       He would not banquet, and carouse, and swill       Amongst the students, as even now he doth,       Who are at supper with such belly-cheer       As Wagner ne'er beheld in all his life.       See, where they come! belike the feast is ended.            [Exit.]              Enter FAUSTUS with two or three SCHOLARS, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.         FIRST SCHOLAR. Master Doctor Faustus, since our conference about       fair ladies, which was the beautifulest in all the world, we have       determined"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#7)"],[1,"read.\"    From end to end on the mighty boat officers were rushing about without  much noise or confusion, but giving orders sharply. Captain Smith told  the third officer to rush downstairs and see whether the water was  coming in very fast. \"And,\" he added, \"take some armed guards along to  see that the stokers and engineers stay at their posts.\"    In two minutes the officer returned. \"It looks pretty bad, sir,\" he  said. \"The water is rushing in and filling the bottom. The locks of the  water-tight compartments have been sprung by the shock.\"    \"Give the command for all passengers to be on deck with life-belts on.\"    Through the length and breadth of the boat, upstairs and downstairs,  on all decks, the cry rang out: \"All passengers on deck with  life-preservers.\"      A SUDDEN TREMOR OF FEAR    For the first time, there was a feeling of panic. Husbands sought for  wives and children. Families gathered together. Many who were asleep  hastily caught up their clothing and rushed on deck. A moment before the  men had been joking about the life-belts, according to the story told by  Mrs. Vera Dick, of Calgary, Canada. \"Try this one,\" one man said to her,  \"they are the very latest thing this season. Everybody's wearing them  now.\"    Another man suggested to a woman friend, who had a fox terrier in her  arms, that she should put a life-saver on the dog. \"It won't fit,\" the  woman replied, laughing. \"Make him carry it in his mouth,\" said the  friend.      CONFUSION AMONG THE IMMIGRANTS    Below, on the steerage deck, there was intense confusion. About the time  the officers on the first deck gave the order that all men should stand  to one side and all women should go below to deck B, taking the children  with them, a similar order was given to the steerage passengers. The  women were ordered to the front, the men to the rear. Half a dozen  healthy, husky immigrants pushed their way forward and tried to crowd  into the first boat.    \"Stand back,\" shouted the officers who were manning the boat. \"The women  come first.\"    Shouting curses in various foreign languages, the immigrant men  continued their pushing and tugging to climb into the boats. Shots  rang out. One big fellow fell over the railing into the water. Another  dropped to the deck, moaning. His jaw had been shot away. This was the  story told by the bystanders afterwards on the pier. One husky Italian  told the writer on the pier that the way in which the men were shot down  was horrible. His sympathy was with the men who were shot.    \"They were only trying to save their lives,\" he said.      WIRELESS OPERATOR DIED AT HIS POST    On board the Titanic, the wireless operator, with a life-belt about  his waist, was hitting the instrument that was sending out C. Q. D.,  messages, \"Struck on iceberg, C. Q. D.\"    \"Shall I tell captain to turn back and help?\" flashed a reply from the  Carpathia.    \"Yes, old man,\" the Titanic wireless operator responded. \"Guess we're  sinking.\"    An hour later, when the second wireless man came into the boxlike room  to tell his companion what the situation was, he found a negro stoker  creeping up behind the operator and saw him raise a knife over his head.  He said afterwards--he was among those rescued--that he realized at  once that the negro intended to kill the operator in order to take his  life-belt from him. The second operator pulled out his revolver and shot  the negro dead.    \"What was the trouble?\" asked the operator.    \"That negro was going to kill you and steal your life-belt,\" the second  man replied.    \"Thanks, old man,\" said the operator. The second man went on deck to get  some more information. He was just in time to jump overboard before the  Titanic went down. The wireless operator and the body of the negro who  tried to steal his belt went down together.    On the deck where the first class passengers were quartered, known as  deck A, there was none of the confusion that was taking place on the  lower decks. The Titanic was standing without much rocking. The captain  had given an order and the band was playing.      {illust. caption = WAITING FOR THE NEWS    A Bird's eye view of the great crowds...}    {illust. caption = WIRELESS STATION AT CAPE RACE    Where the first news of the Titanic disaster was received.}        CHAPTER VI. \"WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST!\"    COOL-HEADED OFFICERS AND CREW BRING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS--FILLING THE  LIFE-BOATS--HEARTRENDING SCENES AS FAMILIES ARE PARTED--FOUR LIFE-BOATS  LOST--INCIDENTS OF BRAVERY--\"THE BOATS ARE ALL FILLED!\"    ONCE on the deck, many hesitated to enter the swinging life-boats. Tho  glassy sea, the starlit sky, the absence, in the first few moments,  of intense excitement, gave them the feeling that there was only some  slight mishap; that those who got into the boats would have a chilly  half hour below and might, later, be laughed at.    It was such a feeling as this, from all accounts, which caused John  Jacob Astor and his wife to refuse the places offered them in the first  boat, and to retire to the gymnasium. In the same way H. J. Allison, a  Montreal banker, laughed at the warning, and his wife, reassured by  him, took her time dressing. They and their daughter did not reach  the Carpathia. Their son, less than two years old, was carried into a  life-boat by his nurse, and was taken in charge by Major Arthur Peuchen.    THE LIFE-BOATS LOWERED    The admiration felt by the passengers and crew for the matchlessly  appointed vessel was translated, in those first few moments, into a  confidence which for some proved deadly. The pulsing of the engines had  ceased, and the steamship lay just as though she were awaiting the order  to go on again after some trifling matter had been adjusted. But in a  few minutes the canvas covers were lifted from the life-boats and the  crews allotted to each standing by, ready to lower them to the water.    Nearly all the boats that were lowered on the port side of the ship  touched the water without capsizing. Four of the others lowered to  starboard, including one collapsible, were capsized. All, however, who  were in the collapsible boats that practically went to pieces, were  rescued by the other boats.    Presently the order was heard: \"All men stand back and all women retire  to the deck below.\" That was the smoking-room deck, or the B deck. The  men stood away and remained in absolute silence, leaning against the  rail or pacing up and down the deck slowly. Many of them lighted cigars  or cigarettes and began to smoke.      LOADING THE BOATS    The boats were swung out and lowered from the A deck above. The women  were marshaled quietly in lines along the B deck, and when the boats  were lowered down to the level of the latter the women were assisted to  climb into them.    As each of the boats was filled with its quota of passengers the word  was given and it was carefully lowered down to the dark surface of the  water.    Nobody seemed to know how Mr. Ismay got into a boat, but it was assumed  that he wished to make a presentation of the case of the Titanic to his  company. He was among those who apparently realized that the splendid  ship was doomed. All hands in the life-boats, under instructions from  officers and men in charge, were rowed a considerable distance from the  ship herself in order to get far away from the possible suction that  would follow her foundering.      COOLEST MEN ON BOARD    Captain Smith and Major Archibald Butt, military aide to the President  of the United States, were among the coolest men on board. A number of  steerage passengers were yelling and screaming and fighting to get to  the boats. Officers drew guns and told them that if they moved towards  the boats they would be shot dead. Major Butt had a gun in his hand and  covered the men who tried to get to the boats.    The following story of his bravery was told by Mrs. Henry B. Harris,  wife of the theatrical manager:    \"The world should rise in praise of Major Butt. That man's conduct will  remain in my memory forever. The American army is honored by him and  the way he taught some of the other men how to behave when women and  children were suffering that awful mental fear of death. Major Butt was  near me and I noticed everything that he did.    \"When the order to man the boats came, the captain whispered something  to Major Butt. The two of them had become friends. The major immediately  became as one in supreme command. You would have thought he was at a  White House reception. A dozen or more women became hysterical all at  once, as something connected with a life-boat went wrong. Major Butt  stepped over to them and said:    \"'Really, you must not act like that; we are all going to see you  through this thing.' He helped the sailors rearrange the rope or chain  that had gone wrong and lifted some of the women in with a touch of  gallantry. Not only was there a complete lack of any fear in his manner,  but there was the action of an aristocrat.    \"When the time came he was a man to be feared. In one of the earlier  boats fifty women, it seemed, were about to be lowered, when a man,  suddenly panic-stricken, ran to the stern of it. Major Butt shot one arm  out, caught him by the back of the neck and jerked him backward like a  pillow. His head cracked against a rail and he was stunned.    \"'Sorry,' said Major Butt, 'women will be attended to first or I'll  break every damned bone in your body.'      FORCED MEN USURPING PLACES TO VACATE    \"The boats were lowered one by one, and as I stood by, my husband said  to me, 'Thank God, for Archie Butt.' Perhaps Major Butt heard it, for he  turned his face towards us for a second and smiled. Just at that moment,  a young man was arguing to get into a life-boat, and Major Butt had a  hold of the lad by the arm, like a big brother, and was telling him to  keep his head and be a man.    \"Major Butt helped those poor frightened steerage people so wonderfully,  so"]]]
