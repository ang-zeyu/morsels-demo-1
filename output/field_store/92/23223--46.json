[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#7)"],[1,"a long war of independence the Egyptians had  driven the Hyksos out of the valley of the Nile and then the Jews had  come upon evil times for they had been degraded to the rank of common  slaves and they had been forced to work on the royal roads and on the  Pyramids. And as the frontiers were guarded by the Egyptian soldiers it  had been impossible for the Jews to escape.    After many years of suffering they were saved from their miserable  fate by a young Jew, called Moses, who for a long time had dwelt in the  desert and there had learned to appreciate the simple virtues of his  earliest ancestors, who had kept away from cities and city-life and had  refused to let themselves be corrupted by the ease and the luxury of a  foreign civilisation.    Moses decided to bring his people back to a love of the ways of the  patriarchs. He succeeded in evading the Egyptian troops that were sent  after him and led his fellow tribesmen into the heart of the plain at  the foot of Mount Sinai. During his long and lonely life in the desert,  he had learned to revere the strength of the great God of the Thunder  and the Storm, who ruled the high heavens and upon whom the shepherds  depended for life and light and breath. This God, one of the many  divinities who were widely worshipped in western Asia, was called  Jehovah, and through the teaching of Moses, he became the sole Master of  the Hebrew race.    One day, Moses disappeared from the camp of the Jews. It was whispered  that he had gone away carrying two tablets of rough-hewn stone. That  afternoon, the top of the mountain was lost to sight. The darkness of  a terrible storm hid it from the eye of man. But when Moses returned,  behold! there stood engraved upon the tablets the words which Jehovah  had spoken unto the people of Israel amidst the crash of his thunder and  the blinding flashes of his lightning. And from that moment, Jehovah was  recognised by all the Jews as the Highest Master of their Fate, the only  True God, who had taught them how to live holy lives when he bade them  to follow the wise lessons of his Ten Commandments.    They followed Moses when he bade them continue their journey through the  desert. They obeyed him when he told them what to eat and drink and what  to avoid that they might keep well in the hot climate. And finally after  many years of wandering they came to a land which seemed pleasant and  prosperous. It was called Palestine, which means the country of the  \"Pilistu\" the Philistines, a small tribe of Cretans who had settled  along the coast after they had been driven away from their own island.  Unfortunately, the mainland, Palestine, was already inhabited by another  Semitic race, called the Canaanites. But the Jews forced their way into  the valleys and built themselves cities and constructed a mighty temple  in a town which they named Jerusalem, the Home of Peace. As for Moses,  he was no longer the leader of his people. He had been allowed to see  the mountain ridges of Palestine from afar. Then he had closed his tired  eyes for all time. He had worked faithfully and hard to please Jehovah.  Not only had he guided his brethren out of foreign slavery into the free  and independent life of a new home but he had also made the Jews the  first of all nations to worship a single God.          THE PHOENICIANS    THE PHOENICIANS WHO GAVE US OUR ALPHABET      THE Phoenicians, who were the neighbours of the Jews, were a Semitic  tribe which at a very early age had settled along the shores of the  Mediterranean. They had built themselves two well-fortified towns, Tyre  and Sidon, and within a short time they had gained a monopoly of the  trade of the western seas. Their ships went regularly to Greece and  Italy and Spain and they even ventured beyond the straits of Gibraltar  to visit the Scilly islands where they could buy tin. Wherever they  went, they built themselves small trading stations, which they called  colonies. Many of these were the origin of modern cities, such as Cadiz  and Marseilles.    They bought and sold whatever promised to bring them a good profit.  They were not troubled by a conscience. If we are to believe all their  neighbours they did not know what the words honesty or integrity meant.  They regarded a well-filled treasure chest the highest ideal of all good  citizens. Indeed they were very unpleasant people and did not have a  single friend. Nevertheless they have rendered all coming generations  one service of the greatest possible value. They gave us our alphabet.    The Phoenicians had been familiar with the art of writing, invented by  the Sumerians. But they regarded these pothooks as a clumsy waste  of time. They were practical business men and could not spend hours  engraving two or three letters. They set to work and invented a new  system of writing which was greatly superior to the old one. They  borrowed a few pictures from the Egyptians and they simplified a number  of the wedge-shaped figures of the Sumerians. They sacrificed the pretty  looks of the older system for the advantage of speed and they reduced  the thousands of different images to a short and handy alphabet of  twenty-two letters.    In due course of time, this alphabet travelled across the AEgean Sea and  entered Greece. The Greeks added a few letters of their own and carried  the improved system to Italy. The Romans modified the figures somewhat  and in turn taught them to the wild barbarians of western Europe. Those  wild barbarians were our own ancestors, and that is the reason why this  book is written in characters that are of Phoenician origin and not  in the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians or in the nail-script of the  Sumerians.          THE INDO-EUROPEANS    THE INDO-EUROPEAN PERSIANS CONQUER THE SEMITIC AND THE EGYPTIAN WORLD      THE world of Egypt and Babylon and Assyria and Phoenicia had existed  almost thirty centuries and the venerable races of the Fertile Valley  were getting old and tired. Their doom was sealed when a new and  more energetic race appeared upon the horizon. We call this race the  Indo-European race, because it conquered not only Europe but also made  itself the ruling class in the country which is now known as British  India.    These Indo-Europeans were white men like the Semites but they spoke  a different language which is regarded as the common ancestor of all  European tongues with the exception of Hungarian and Finnish and the  Basque dialects of Northern Spain.    When we first hear of them, they had been living along the shores of the  Caspian Sea for many centuries. But one day they had packed their tents  and they had wandered forth in search of a new home. Some of them had  moved into the mountains of Central Asia and for many centuries they had  lived among the peaks which surround the plateau of Iran and that is why  we call them Aryans. Others had followed the setting sun and they had  taken possession of the plains of Europe as I shall tell you when I give  you the story of Greece and Rome.    For the moment we must follow the Aryans. Under the leadership of  Zarathustra (or Zoroaster) who was their great teacher many of them had  left their mountain homes to follow the swiftly flowing Indus river on  its way to the sea.    Others had preferred to stay among the hills of western Asia and there  they had founded the half-independent communities of the Medes and the  Persians, two peoples whose names we have copied from the old Greek  history-books. In the seventh century before the birth of Christ, the  Medes had established a kingdom of their own called Media, but this  perished when Cyrus, the chief of a clan known as the Anshan, made  himself king of all the Persian tribes and started upon a career of  conquest which soon made him and his children the undisputed masters of  the whole of western Asia and of Egypt.    Indeed, with such energy did these Indo-European Persians push their  triumphant campaigns in the west that they soon found themselves in  serious difficulties with certain other Indo-European tribes which  centuries before had moved into Europe and had taken possession of the  Greek peninsula and the islands of the AEgean Sea.    These difficulties led to the three famous wars between Greece and  Persia during which King Darius and King Xerxes of Persia invaded the  northern part of the peninsula. They ravaged the lands of the Greeks and  tried very hard to get a foothold upon the European continent.    But in this they did not succeed. The navy of Athens proved  unconquerable. By cutting off the lines of supplies of the Persian  armies, the Greek sailors invariably forced the Asiatic rulers to return  to their base.    It was the first encounter between Asia, the ancient teacher, and  Europe, the young and eager pupil. A great many of the other chapters  of this book will tell you how the struggle between east and west has  continued until this very day.          THE AEGEAN SEA    THE PEOPLE OF THE AEGEAN SEA CARRIED THE CIVILISATION OF OLD ASIA INTO  THE WILDERNESS OF EUROPE      WHEN Heinrich Schliemann was a little boy his father told him the story  of Troy. He liked that story better than anything else he had ever heard  and he made up his mind, that as soon as he was big enough to leave  home, he would travel to Greece and \"find Troy.\" That he was the son of  a poor country parson in a Mecklenburg village did not bother him. He  knew that he would need money but he decided to gather a fortune first  and do the digging afterwards. As a matter of fact, he managed to get  a large fortune within a very short time, and as soon as he had enough  money to equip an expedition, he went to the northwest corner of Asia  Minor, where he supposed that Troy had been situated.    In that particular nook of old Asia Minor, stood a high mound covered  with grainfields. According to tradition it had been the home of Priamus  the king of Troy.

'It never could have been  bewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't!'    'Yes, it was. \"Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield\",' I repeated stoutly. 'And,  \"pretty.\"'    'No, no, it was never pretty. Not pretty,' interposed my mother, laying  her fingers on my lips again.    'Yes it was. \"Pretty little widow.\"'    'What foolish, impudent creatures!' cried my mother, laughing and  covering her face. 'What ridiculous men! An't they? Davy dear--'    'Well, Ma.'    'Don't tell Peggotty; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully  angry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know.'    I promised, of course; and we kissed one another over and over again,  and I soon fell fast asleep.    It seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day  when Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am  about to mention; but it was probably about two months afterwards.    We were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out as  before), in company with the stocking and the yard-measure, and the bit  of wax, and the box with St. Paul's on the lid, and the crocodile book,  when Peggotty, after looking at me several times, and opening her mouth  as if she were going to speak, without doing it--which I thought was  merely gaping, or I should have been rather alarmed--said coaxingly:    'Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend a  fortnight at my brother's at Yarmouth? Wouldn't that be a treat?'    'Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?' I inquired, provisionally.    'Oh, what an agreeable man he is!' cried Peggotty, holding up her hands.  'Then there's the sea; and the boats and ships; and the fishermen; and  the beach; and Am to play with--'    Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter; but she  spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar.    I was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it would  indeed be a treat, but what would my mother say?    'Why then I'll as good as bet a guinea,' said Peggotty, intent upon my  face, 'that she'll let us go. I'll ask her, if you like, as soon as ever  she comes home. There now!'    'But what's she to do while we're away?' said I, putting my small elbows  on the table to argue the point. 'She can't live by herself.'    If Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the heel of  that stocking, it must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth  darning.    'I say! Peggotty! She can't live by herself, you know.'    'Oh, bless you!' said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. 'Don't  you know? She's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper. Mrs.  Grayper's going to have a lot of company.'    Oh! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the utmost  impatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper's (for it was  that identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry  out this great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had  expected, my mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged  that night, and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid  for.    The day soon came for our going. It was such an early day that it came  soon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid  that an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsion  of nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a  carrier's cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would  have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,  and sleep in my hat and boots.    It touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect how  eager I was to leave my happy home; to think how little I suspected what  I did leave for ever.    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier's cart was at the gate, and  my mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for  the old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am  glad to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat  against mine.    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother  ran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she might kiss me  once more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which  she lifted up her face to mine, and did so.    As we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where  she was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. I was  looking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business  it was of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side,  seemed anything but satisfied; as the face she brought back in the cart  denoted.    I sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this  supposititious case: whether, if she were employed to lose me like the  boy in the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by  the buttons she would shed.        CHAPTER 3. I HAVE A CHANGE      The carrier's horse was the laziest horse in the world, I should hope,  and shuffled along, with his head down, as if he liked to keep people  waiting to whom the packages were directed. I fancied, indeed, that he  sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the carrier said  he was only troubled with a cough. The carrier had a way of keeping his  head down, like his horse, and of drooping sleepily forward as he drove,  with one of his arms on each of his knees. I say 'drove', but it struck  me that the cart would have gone to Yarmouth quite as well without him,  for the horse did all that; and as to conversation, he had no idea of it  but whistling.    Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would have  lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the same  conveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. Peggotty always  went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket, her hold of  which never relaxed; and I could not have believed unless I had heard  her do it, that one defenceless woman could have snored so much.    We made so many deviations up and down lanes, and were such a long time  delivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at other places,  that I was quite tired, and very glad, when we saw Yarmouth. It looked  rather spongy and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye over the great  dull waste that lay across the river; and I could not help wondering, if  the world were really as round as my geography book said, how any  part of it came to be so flat. But I reflected that Yarmouth might be  situated at one of the poles; which would account for it.    As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a  straight low line under the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so  might have improved it; and also that if the land had been a little more  separated from the sea, and the town and the tide had not been quite  so much mixed up, like toast and water, it would have been nicer. But  Peggotty said, with greater emphasis than usual, that we must take  things as we found them, and that, for her part, she was proud to call  herself a Yarmouth Bloater.    When we got into the street (which was strange enough to me) and smelt  the fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors walking  about, and the carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt that I  had done so busy a place an injustice; and said as much to Peggotty, who  heard my expressions of delight with great complacency, and told me it  was well known (I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born  Bloaters) that Yarmouth was, upon the whole, the finest place in the  universe.    'Here's my Am!' screamed Peggotty, 'growed out of knowledge!'    He was waiting for us, in fact, at the public-house; and asked me how I  found myself, like an old acquaintance. I did not feel, at first, that  I knew him as well as he knew me, because he had never come to our house  since the night I was born, and naturally he had the advantage of me.  But our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry  me home. He was, now, a huge, strong fellow of six feet high, broad in  proportion, and round-shouldered; but with a simpering boy's face and  curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look. He was dressed in  a canvas jacket, and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they  would have stood quite as well alone, without any legs in them. And you  couldn't so properly have said he wore a hat, as that he was covered in  a-top, like an old building, with something pitchy.    Ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm,  and Peggotty carrying another small box of ours, we turned down lanes  bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand, and went  past gas-works, rope-walks, boat-builders' yards, shipwrights' yards,  ship-breakers' yards, caulkers' yards, riggers' lofts, smiths' forges,  and a great litter of such places, until we came out upon the dull waste  I had already seen at a distance; when Ham said,    'Yon's our house, Mas'r Davy!'    I looked in all directions, as far as I could stare over the wilderness,  and away at the sea, and away at the river, but no house could I make  out. There was a black barge, or some other kind of superannuated boat,  not far off, high and dry on the ground, with an iron funnel sticking  out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily; but nothing else in the  way of a habitation that was visible to me.    'That's not it?' said I. 'That ship-looking thing?'    'That's it, Mas'r Davy,' returned Ham.    If it had been Aladdin's palace, roc's egg and all, I suppose I could  not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it. There  was a delightful door cut in the side, and it was roofed in, and there  were little windows in it; but the wonderful charm of it was, that  it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon"]]]
