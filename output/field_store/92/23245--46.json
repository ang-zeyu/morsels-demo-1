[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8129"],[0,"A Dreamer's Tales (#7)"],[1,"terrible gnousar sickness was upon the three travellers,  and that their very mules were dripping with it, and suppose that they  were driven to the city by hunger, but suggest no better reason for so  terrible a crime.    But most believe that it was a message from the desert himself, who owns  all the Earth to the southwards, spoken with his peculiar cry to those  three who knew his voice--men who had been out on the sand-wastes without  tents by night, who had been by day without water, men who had been out  there where the desert mutters, and had grown to know his needs and his  malevolence. They say that the desert had a need for Bethmoora, that he  wished to come into her lovely streets, and to send into her temples and  her houses his storm-winds draped with sand. For he hates the sound and  the sight of men in his old evil heart, and he would have Bethmoora silent  and undisturbed, save for the weird love he whispers to her gates.    If I knew what that message was that the three men brought on mules, and  told in the copper gate, I think that I should go and see Bethmoora once  again. For a great longing comes on me here in London to see once more  that white and beautiful city, and yet I dare not, for I know not the  danger I should have to face, whether I should risk the fury of unknown  dreadful gods, or some disease unspeakable and slow, or the desert's curse  or torture in some little private room of the Emperor Thuba Mleen, or  something that the travelers have not told--perhaps more fearful still.          IDLE DAYS ON THE YANN      So I came down through the wood on the bank of Yann and found, as had been  prophesied, the ship _Bird of the River_ about to loose her cable.    The captain sat cross-legged upon the white deck with his scimitar lying  beside him in its jeweled scabbard, and the sailors toiled to spread the  nimble sails to bring the ship into the central stream of Yann, and all  the while sang ancient soothing songs. And the wind of the evening  descending cool from the snowfields of some mountainous abode of distant  gods came suddenly, like glad tidings to an anxious city, into the  wing-like sails.    And so we came into the central stream, whereat the sailors lowered the  greater sails. But I had gone to bow before the captain, and to inquire  concerning the miracles, and appearances among men, of the most holy gods  of whatever land he had come from. And the captain answered that he came  from fair Belzoond, and worshipped gods that were the least and humblest,  who seldom sent the famine or the thunder, and were easily appeased with  little battles. And I told how I came from Ireland, which is of Europe,  whereat the captain and all the sailors laughed, for they said, \"There are  no such places in all the land of dreams.\" When they had ceased to mock  me, I explained that my fancy mostly dwelt in the desert of Cuppar-Nombo,  about a beautiful blue city called Golthoth the Damned, which was  sentinelled all round by wolves and their shadows, and had been utterly  desolate for years and years, because of a curse which the gods once spoke  in anger and could never since recall. And sometimes my dreams took me as  far as Pungar Vees, the red walled city where the fountains are, which  trades with the Isles and Thul. When I said this they complimented me upon  the abode of my fancy, saying that, though they had never seen these  cities, such places might well be imagined. For the rest of that evening I  bargained with the captain over the sum that I should pay him for any fare  if God and the tide of Yann should bring us safely as far as the cliffs by  the sea, which are named Bar-Wul-Yann, the Gate of Yann.    And now the sun had set, and all the colours of the world and heaven had  held a festival with him, and slipped one by one away before the imminent  approach of night. The parrots had all flown home to the jungle on either  bank, the monkeys in rows in safety on high branches of the trees were  silent and asleep, the fireflies in the deeps of the forest were going up  and down, and the great stars came gleaming out to look on the face of  Yann. Then the sailors lighted lanterns and hung them round the ship, and  the light flashed out on a sudden and dazzled Yann, and the ducks that fed  along his marshy banks all suddenly arose, and made wide circles in the  upper air, and saw the distant reaches of the Yann and the white mist that  softly cloaked the jungle, before they returned again to their marshes.    And then the sailors knelt on the decks and prayed, not all together, but  five or six at a time. Side by side there kneeled down together five or  six, for there only prayed at the same time men of different faiths, so  that no god should hear two men praying to him at once. As soon as any one  had finished his prayer, another of the same faith would take his place.  Thus knelt the row of five or six with bended heads under the fluttering  sail, while the central stream of the River Yann took them on towards the  sea, and their prayers rose up from among the lanterns and went towards  the stars. And behind them in the after end of the ship the helmsman  prayed aloud the helmsman's prayer, which is prayed by all who follow his  trade upon the River Yann, of whatever faith they be. And the captain  prayed to his little lesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.    And I too felt that I would pray. Yet I liked not to pray to a jealous God  there where the frail affectionate gods whom the heathen love were being  humbly invoked; so I bethought me, instead, of Sheol Nugganoth, whom the  men of the jungle have long since deserted, who is now unworshipped and  alone; and to him I prayed.    And upon us praying the night came suddenly down, as it comes upon all men  who pray at evening and upon all men who do not; yet our prayers comforted  our own souls when we thought of the Great Night to come.    And so Yann bore us magnificently onwards, for he was elate with molten  snow that the Poltiades had brought him from the Hills of Hap, and the  Marn and Migris were swollen with floods; and he bore us in his full might  past Kyph and Pir, and we saw the lights of Goolunza.    Soon we all slept except the helmsman, who kept the ship in the mid-stream  of Yann.    When the sun rose the helmsman ceased to sing, for by song he cheered  himself in the lonely night. When the song ceased we suddenly all awoke,  and another took the helm, and the helmsman slept.    We knew that soon we should come to Mandaroon. We made a meal, and  Mandaroon appeared. Then the captain commanded, and the sailors loosed  again the greater sails, and the ship turned and left the stream of Yann  and came into a harbour beneath the ruddy walls of Mandaroon. Then while  the sailors went and gathered fruits I came alone to the gate of  Mandaroon. A few huts were outside it, in which lived the guard. A  sentinel with a long white beard was standing in the gate, armed with a  rusty pike. He wore large spectacles, which were covered with dust.  Through the gate I saw the city. A deathly stillness was over all of it.  The ways seemed untrodden, and moss was thick on doorsteps; in the  market-place huddled figures lay asleep. A scent of incense came wafted  through the gateway, of incense and burned poppies, and there was a hum of  the echoes of distant bells. I said to the sentinel in the tongue of the  region of Yann, \"Why are they all asleep in this still city?\"    He answered: \"None may ask questions in this gate for fear they will wake  the people of the city. For when the people of this city wake the gods  will die. And when the gods die men may dream no more.\" And I began to ask  him what gods that city worshipped, but he lifted his pike because none  might ask questions there. So I left him and went back to the _Bird of the  River_.    Certainly Mandaroon was beautiful with her white pinnacles peering over  her ruddy walls and the green of her copper roofs.    When I came back again to the _Bird of the River_, I found the sailors  were returned to the ship. Soon we weighed anchor, and sailed out again,  and so came once more to the middle of the river. And now the sun was  moving toward his heights, and there had reached us on the River Yann the  song of those countless myriads of choirs that attend him in his progress  round the world. For the little creatures that have many legs had spread  their gauze wings easily on the air, as a man rests his elbows on a  balcony and gave jubilant, ceremonial praises to the sun, or else they  moved together on the air in wavering dances intricate and swift, or  turned aside to avoid the onrush of some drop of water that a breeze had  shaken from a jungle orchid, chilling the air and driving it before it, as  it fell whirring in its rush to the earth; but all the while they sang  triumphantly. \"For the day is for us,\" they said, \"whether our great and  sacred father the Sun shall bring up more life like us from the marshes,  or whether all the world shall end tonight.\" And there sang all those  whose notes are known to human ears, as well as those whose far more  numerous notes have been never heard by man.    To these a rainy day had been as an era of war that should desolate  continents during all the lifetime of a man.    And there came out also from the dark and steaming jungle to behold and  rejoice in the Sun the huge and lazy butterflies. And they danced, but  danced idly, on the ways of the air, as some haughty queen of distant  conquered lands might in her poverty and exile dance, in some encampment  of the gipsies, for the mere bread to live by, but beyond that would never  abate her pride to dance for a fragment more.    And the butterflies sung of strange and painted things, of purple orchids  and of lost pink cities and the monstrous colours of the jungle's decay.  And they, too, were among those whose voices are not discernible by human  ears. And as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#7)"],[1," and traces,\" and on the same page: \"'Tender art thou,' and the  whole thing is charming. You have never done anything better; it is all  charming.\" The quotation is from Fet's poem:    The lingering clouds' last throng flies over us.      But it was not only community of interests that brought my father and  Afanasyi Afanasyevitch together. The reason of their intimacy lay in  the fact that, as my father expressed it, they \"thought alike with their  heart's mind.\"    I also remember Nikolai Nikolayevitch Strakhof's visits. He was a  remarkably quiet and modest man. He appeared at Yasnaya Polyana in the  beginning of the seventies, and from that time on came and stayed with  us almost every summer till he died.    He had big, gray eyes, wide open, as if in astonishment; a long beard  with a touch of gray in it; and when he spoke, at the end of every  sentence he gave a shy laugh.    When he addressed my father, he always said \"Lef Nikolayevitch\" instead  of Lyoff Nikolaievich, like other people.    He always stayed down-stairs in my father's study, and spent his whole  day there reading or writing, with a thick cigarette, which he rolled  himself, in his mouth.    Strakhof and my father came together originally on a purely business  footing. When the first part of my father's \"Alphabet and Reading-Book\"  was printed, Strakhof had charge of the proof-reading. This led to a  correspondence between him and my father, of a business character at  first, later developing into a philosophical and friendly one. While he  was writing \"Anna Karenina,\" my father set great store by his opinion  and valued his critical instinct very highly.    \"It is enough for me that that is your opinion,\" he writes in a letter  of 1872, probably apropos of the \"Alphabet.\"    In 1876, apropos of \"Anna Karenina\" this time, my father wrote:    \"You ask me whether you have understood my novel aright, and what I  think of your opinion. Of course you understood it aright. Of course I  am overjoyed at your understanding of it; but it does not follow that  everybody will understand it as you do.\"    But it was not only his critical work that drew my father to Strakhof.  He disliked critics on the whole and used to say that the only people  who took to criticism were those who had no creative faculty of their  own. \"The stupid ones judge the clever ones,\" he said of professional  critics. What he valued most in Strakhof was the profound and  penetrating thinker. He was a \"real friend\" of my father's,--my father  himself so described him,--and I recall his memory with deep affection  and respect.    At last I have come to the memory of the man who was nearer in spirit to  my father than any other human being, namely, Nikolai Nikolayevitch  Gay. Grandfather Gay, as we called him, made my father's acquaintance  in 1882. While living on his farm in the Province of Tchernigoff, he  chanced to read my father's pamphlet \"On the Census,\" and finding a  solution in it of the very questions which were troubling him at the  time, without delay he started out and hurried into Moscow. I remember  his first arrival, and I have always retained the impression that from  the first words they exchanged he and my father understood each other,  and found themselves speaking the same language.    Just like my father, Gay was at this time passing through a great  spiritual crisis; and traveling almost the same road as my father in his  search after truth, he had arrived at the study of the Gospel and a new  understanding of it. My sister Tatyana wrote:    For the personality of Christ he entertained a passionate and tender  affection, as if for a near and familiar friend whom he loved with  all the strength of his soul. Often during heated arguments Nikolai  Nikolayevitch would take the Gospel, which he always carried about with  him, from his pocket, and read out some passage from it appropriate to  the subject in hand. \"This book contains everything that a man needs,\"  he used to say on these occasions.    While reading the Gospel, he often looked up at the person he was  talking to and went on reading without looking at the book. His face  glowed at such moments with such inward joy that one could see how near  and dear the words he was reading were to his heart.    He knew the whole Gospel almost by heart, but he said that every time he  read it he enjoyed a new and genuine spiritual delight. He said that not  only was everything intelligible to him in the Gospel, but that when  he read it he seemed to be reading in his own soul, and felt himself  capable of rising higher and higher toward God and merging himself in  Him.          TURGENIEFF    I DO not mean to recount all the misunderstandings which existed between  my father and Turgenieff, which ended in a complete breach between them  in 1861. The actual external facts of that story are common property,  and there is no need to repeat them. [17] According to general opinion,  the quarrel between the two greatest writers of the day arose out of  their literary rivalry.    It is my intention to show cause against this generally received  opinion, and before I come to Turgenieff's visits to Yasnaya Polyana, I  want to make as clear as I can the real reason of the perpetual discords  between these two good-hearted people, who had a cordial affection for  each other--discords which led in the end to an out-and-out quarrel and  the exchange of mutual defiance.    As far as I know, my father never had any serious difference with  any other human being during the whole course of his existence. And  Turgenieff, in a letter to my father in 1865, wrote, \"You are the only  man with whom I have ever had misunderstandings.\"    Whenever my father related his quarrel with Ivan Sergeyevitch, he took  all the blame on himself. Turgenieff, immediately after the quarrel,  wrote a letter apologizing to my father, and never sought to justify his  own part in it.    Why was it that, as Turgenieff himself put it, his \"constellation\" and  my father's \"moved in the ether with unquestioned enmity\"?    This is what my sister Tatyana wrote on the subject in her article  \"Turgenieff,\" published in the supplement to the \"Novoye Vremya,\"  February 2, 1908:      All question of literary rivalry, it seems to me, is utterly beside the  mark. Turgenieff, from the very outset of my father's literary career,  acknowledged his enormous talents, and never thought of rivalry with  him. From the moment when, as early as 1854, he wrote to Kolbasina, \"If  Heaven only grant Tolstoy life, I confidently hope that he will surprise  us all,\" he never ceased to follow my father's work with interest, and  always expressed his unbounded admiration of it.      \"When this young wine has done fermenting,\" he wrote to Druzhenin in  1856, \"the result will be a liquor worthy of the gods.\" In 1857 he wrote  to Polonsky, \"This man will go far, and leave deep traces behind him.\"    Nevertheless, somehow these two men never could \"hit it off\" together.  When one reads Turgenieff's letters to my father, one sees that from  the very beginning of their acquaintance misunderstandings were always  arising, which they perpetually endeavored to smooth down or to  forget, but which arose again after a time, sometimes in another form,  necessitating new explanations and reconciliations.    In 1856 Turgenieff wrote to my father:      Your letter took some time reaching me, dear Lyoff Nikolaievich. Let me  begin by saying that I am very grateful to you for sending it to me. I  shall never cease to love you and to value your friendship, although,  probably through my fault, each of us will long feel considerable  awkwardness in the presence of the other.... I think that you yourself  understand the reason of this awkwardness of which I speak. You are the  only man with whom I have ever had misunderstandings.    This arises from the very fact that I have never been willing to confine  myself to merely friendly relations with you. I have always wanted to go  further and deeper than that; but I set about it clumsily. I irritated  and upset you, and when I saw my mistake, I drew back too hastily,  perhaps; and it was this which caused this \"gulf\" between us.    But this awkwardness is a mere physical impression, nothing more; and  if when we meet again, you see the old \"mischievous look in my eyes,\"  believe me, the reason of it will not be that I am a bad man. I assure  you that there is no need to look for any other explanation. Perhaps  I may add, also, that I am much older than you, and I have traveled  a different road.... Outside of our special, so-called \"literary\"  interests, I am convinced, we have few points of contact. Your whole  being stretches out hands toward the future; mine is built up in the  past. For me to follow you is impossible. For you to follow me is  equally out of the question. You are too far removed from me, and  besides, you stand too firmly on your own legs to become any one's  disciple. I can assure you that I never attributed any malice to you,  never suspected you of any literary envy. I have often thought, if you  will excuse the expression, that you were wanting in common sense, but  never in goodness. You are too penetrating not to know that if either of  us has cause to envy the other, it is certainly not you that has cause  to envy me.      The following year he wrote a letter to my father which, it seems to me,  is a key to the understanding of Turgenieff's attitude toward him:      You write that you are very glad you did not follow my advice and become  a pure man of letters. I don't deny it; perhaps you are right. Still,  batter my poor brains as I may, I cannot imagine what else you are if  you are not a man of letters. A soldier? A squire? A philosopher?  The founder of a new religious doctrine? A civil servant? A man of  business?... Please resolve my difficulties, and tell me which of these  suppositions is correct. I am joking, but I"]]]
