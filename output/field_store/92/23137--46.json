Doubtless prophets of evil still exist in our midst.  But  government credit will be maintained and a sound currency will  accompany a rise in the American commodity price level.    I have told you tonight the story of our steady but sure work in  building our common recovery.  In my promises to you both before and  after March 4th, I made two things plain:  First, that I pledged no  miracles and, second, that I would do my best.    I thank you for your patience and your faith.  Our troubles will not  be over tomorrow, but we are on our way and we are headed in the  right direction.        June 28, 1934.      It has been several months since I have talked with you concerning  the problems of government.  Since January, those of us in whom you  have vested responsibility have been engaged in the fulfillment of  plans and policies which had been widely discussed in previous  months.  It seemed to us our duty not only to make the right path  clear but also to tread that path.    As we review the achievements of this session of the Seventy-third  Congress, it is made increasingly clear that its task was  essentially that of completing and fortifying the work it had begun  in March, l933.  That was no easy task, but the Congress was equal  to it.  It has been well said that while there were a few  exceptions, this Congress displayed a greater freedom from mere  partisanship than any other peace-time Congress since the  administration of President Washington himself.  The session was  distinguished by the extent and variety of legislation enacted and  by the intelligence and good will of debate upon these measures.    I mention only a few of the major enactments.  It provided for the  readjustment of the debt burden through the corporate and municipal  bankruptcy acts and the Farm Relief Act.  It lent a hand to industry  by encouraging loans to solvent industries unable to secure  adequate help from banking institutions.  It strengthened the  integrity of finance through the regulation of securities  exchanges.  It provided a rational method of increasing our volume  of foreign trade through reciprocal trading agreements.  It  strengthened our naval forces to conform with the intentions and  permission of existing treaty rights.  It made further advances  towards peace in industry through the Labor Adjustment Act.  It  supplemented our agricultural policy through measures widely  demanded by farmers themselves and intended to avert price  destroying surpluses.  It strengthened the hand of the federal  government in its attempts to suppress gangster crime.  It took  definite steps towards a national housing program through an act  which I signed today designed to encourage private capital in the  rebuilding of the homes of the nation.  It created a permanent  federal body for the just regulation of all forms of communication,  including the telephone, the telegraph and the radio.  Finally, and  I believe most important, it reorganized, simplified and made more  fair and just our monetary system, setting up standards and  policies adequate to meet the necessities of modern economic life,  doing justice to both gold and silver as the metal bases behind the  currency of the United States.    In the consistent development of our previous efforts toward the  saving and safeguarding of our national life, I have continued to  recognize three related steps.  The first was relief, because the  primary concern of any government dominated by the humane ideals of  democracy is the simple principle that in a land of vast resources  no one should be permitted to starve.  Relief was and continues to  be our first consideration.  It calls for large expenditures and  will continue in modified form to do so for a long time to come.  We  may as well recognize that fact.  It comes from the paralysis that  arose as the after-effect of that unfortunate decade characterized  by a mad chase for unearned riches and an unwillingness of leaders  in almost every walk of life to look beyond their own schemes and  speculations.  In our administration of relief we follow two  principles:  First, that direct giving shall, wherever possible, be  supplemented by provision for useful and remunerative work and,  second, that where families in their existing surroundings will in  all human probability never find an opportunity for full self-  maintenance, happiness and enjoyment, we will try to give them a  new chance in new surroundings.    The second step was recovery, and it is sufficient for me to ask  each and every one of you to compare the situation in agriculture  and in industry today with what it was fifteen months ago.    At the same time we have recognized the necessity of reform and  reconstruction--reform because much of our trouble today and in the  past few years has been due to a lack of understanding of the  elementary principles of justice and fairness by those in whom  leadership in business and finance was placed--reconstruction  because new conditions in our economic life as well as old but  neglected conditions had to be corrected.    Substantial gains well known to all of you have justified our  course.  I could cite statistics to you as unanswerable measures of  our national progress--statistics to show the gain in the average  weekly pay envelope of workers in the great majority of  industries--statistics to show hundreds of thousands reemployed in  private industries and other hundreds of thousands given new  employment through the expansion of direct and indirect government  assistance of many kinds, although, of course, there are those  exceptions in professional pursuits whose economic improvement, of  necessity, will be delayed.  I also could cite statistics to show  the great rise in the value of farm products--statistics to prove  the demand for consumers' goods, ranging all the way from food and  clothing to automobiles, and of late to prove the rise in the  demand for durable goods--statistics to cover the great increase in  bank deposits and to show the scores of thousands of homes and of  farms which have been saved from foreclosure.    But the simplest way for each of you to judge recovery lies in the  plain facts of your own individual situation.  Are you better off  than you were last year?  Are your debts less burdensome?  Is your  bank account more secure?  Are your working conditions better?  Is  your faith in your own individual future more firmly grounded?    Also, let me put to you another simple question:  Have you as an  individual paid too high a price for these gains?  Plausible self-  seekers and theoretical die-hards will tell you of the loss of  individual liberty.  Answer this question also out of the facts of  your own life.  Have you lost any of your rights or liberty or  constitutional freedom of action and choice?  Turn to the Bill of  Rights of the Constitution, which I have solemnly sworn to maintain  and under which your freedom rests secure.  Read each provision of  that Bill of Rights and ask yourself whether you personally have  suffered the impairment of a single jot of these great assurances.  I have no question in my mind as to what your answer will be.  The  record is written in the experiences of your own personal lives.    In other words, it is not the overwhelming majority of the farmers  or manufacturers or workers who deny the substantial gains of the  past year.  The most vociferous of the Doubting Thomases may be  divided roughly into two groups:  First, those who seek special  political privilege and, second, those who seek special financial  privilege.  About a year ago I used as an illustration the 90  percent of the cotton manufacturers of the United States who wanted  to do the right thing by their employees and by the public but were  prevented from doing so by the 10 percent who undercut them by  unfair practices and un-American standards.  It is well for us to  remember that humanity is a long way from being perfect and that a  selfish minority in every walk of life--farming, business, finance  and even government service itself--will always continue to think  of themselves first and their fellow-beings second.    In the working out of a great national program which seeks the  primary good of the greater number, it is true that the toes of  some people are being stepped on and are going to be stepped on.  But these toes belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or  to gain position or riches or both by some short cut which is  harmful to the greater good.    In the execution of the powers conferred on it by Congress, the  administration needs and will tirelessly seek the best ability that  the country affords.  Public service offers better rewards in the  opportunity for service than ever before in our history--not great  salaries, but enough to live on.  In the building of this service  there are coming to us men and women with ability and courage from  every part of the Union.  The days of the seeking of mere party  advantage through the misuse of public power are drawing to a  close.  We are increasingly demanding and getting devotion to the  public service on the part of every member of the administration,  high and low.    The program of the past year is definitely in operation and that  operation month by month is being made to fit into the web of old  and new conditions.  This process of evolution is well illustrated  by the constant changes in detailed organization and method going  on in the National Recovery Administration.  With every passing  month we are making strides in the orderly handling of the  relationship between employees and employers.  Conditions differ, of  course, in almost every part of the country and in almost every  industry.  Temporary methods of adjustment are being replaced by  more permanent machinery and, I am glad to say, by a growing  recognition on the part of employers and employees of the  desirability of maintaining "]]]
