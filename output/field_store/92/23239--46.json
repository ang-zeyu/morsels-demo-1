and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?    01:017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before             thee!    01:017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and             thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my             covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his             seed after him.    01:017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed             him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him             exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make             him a great nation.    01:017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall             bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.    01:017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from             Abraham.    01:017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in             his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male             among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of             their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.    01:017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was             circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.    01:017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was             circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.    01:017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his             son.    01:017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought             with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.    01:018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he             sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;    01:018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood             by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the             tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,    01:018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,             pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:    01:018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your             feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:    01:018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your             hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come             to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.    01:018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make             ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make             cakes upon the hearth.    01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and             good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.    01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had             dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under             the tree, and they did eat.    01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,             Behold, in the tent.    01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to             the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.             And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.    01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and             it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.    01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am             waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?    01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,             saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?    01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I             will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and             Sarah shall have a son.    01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.             And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.    01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and             Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.    01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which             I do;    01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty             nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in             him?    01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his             household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,             to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon             Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.    01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is             great, and because their sin is very grievous;    01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether             according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,             I will know.    01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward             Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.    01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the             righteous with the wicked?    01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt             thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty             righteous that are therein?    01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the             righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as             the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all             the earth do right?    01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within             the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.    01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon             me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:    01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:             wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,             If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.    01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there             shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for             forty's sake.    01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will             speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he             said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.    01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto             the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And             he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.    01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak             yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.

   03:013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be             turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean             that hath the plague: he is clean.    03:013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a             boil, and is healed,    03:013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a             bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to             the priest;    03:013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower             than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the             priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy             broken out of the boil.    03:013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white             hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be             somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:    03:013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest             shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.    03:013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it             is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.    03:013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot             burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright             spot, somewhat reddish, or white;    03:013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair             in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper             than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:             wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the             plague of leprosy.    03:013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white             hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other             skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up             seven days:    03:013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it             be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall             pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.    03:013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in             the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the             burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is             an inflammation of the burning.    03:013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;    03:013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in             sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin             hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry             scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.    03:013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,             behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that             there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up             him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:    03:013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:             and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no             yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the             skin;    03:013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the             priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:    03:013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:             and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in             sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce             him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.    03:013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;    03:013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall             be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow             hair; he is unclean.    03:013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is             black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:             and the priest shall pronounce him clean.    03:013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh             bright spots, even white bright spots;    03:013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots             in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled             spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.    03:013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet             is he clean.    03:013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head             toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.    03:013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white             reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or             his bald forehead.    03:013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising             of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald             forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;    03:013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce             him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.    03:013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be             rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his             upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.    03:013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be             defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp             shall his habitation be.    03:013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it             be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;    03:013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;             whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;    03:013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in             the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing             of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto             the priest:    03:013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that             hath the plague seven days:    03:013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the             plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the             woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the             plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.    03:013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in             woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague             is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the             fire.    03:013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not             spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or             in any thing of skin;    03:013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein             the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:    03:013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is             washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his             colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou             shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be             bare within or without.    03:013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat             dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the             garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the             woof:    03:013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or             in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading             plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.    03:013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of             skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed             from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall             be clean.    03:013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of             woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of             skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
