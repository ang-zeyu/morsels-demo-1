I've got some pennies for you.\"    So poor Jocko climbed slowly up the trellis, and sat on the window-ledge  trying to eat; but he was so tired he went to sleep, and when the man  pulled to wake him up, he slipped and fell, and lay as if he were dead.  Neddy and his aunt ran down to see if he was killed. The cross man  scolded and shook him; but he never moved, and the man said,--    \"He is dead. I don't want him. I will sell him to some one to stuff.\"    \"No; his heart beats a little. Leave him here a few days, and we will  take care of him; and if he gets well, perhaps we will buy him,\" said  Aunt Jane, who liked to nurse even a sick monkey.    The man said he was going on for a week through the towns near by, and  would call and see about it when he came back. Then he went away; and  Neddy and aunty put Jocko in a nice basket, and carried him in. The  minute the door was shut and he felt safe, the sly fellow peeped out  with one eye, and seeing only the kind little boy began to chatter and  kick off the shawl; for he was not much hurt, only tired and hungry, and  dreadfully afraid of the cruel man who beat and starved him.    Neddy was delighted, and thought it very funny, and helped his aunt take  off the stiff collar and put some salve on the sore neck. Then they got  milk and cake; and when he had eaten a good dinner, Jocko curled himself  up and slept till the next day. He was quite lively in the morning;  for when Aunt Jane went to call Neddy, Jocko was not in his basket, and  looking round the room for him, she saw the little black thing lying on  the boy's pillow, with his arm round Neddy's neck like a queer baby.    \"My patience! I can't allow that,\" said the old lady, and went to pull  Jocko out. But he slipped away like an eel, and crept chattering and  burrowing down to the bottom of the bed, holding on to Neddy's toes,  till he waked up, howling that crabs were nipping him.    Then they had a great frolic; and Jocko climbed all over the bed, up on  the tall wardrobe, and the shelf over the door, where the image of an  angel stood. He patted it, and hugged it, and looked so very funny with  his ugly black face by the pretty white one, that Neddy rolled on the  floor, and Aunt Jane laughed till her glasses flew off. By and by he  came down, and had a nice breakfast, and let them tie a red ribbon over  the bandage on his neck. He liked the gay color, and kept going to look  in the glass, and grin and chatter at his own image, which he evidently  admired.    \"Now, he shall go to walk with me, and all the children shall see my new  pet,\" said Neddy, as he marched off with Jock on his shoulder.    Every one laughed at the funny little fellow with his twinkling eyes,  brown hands, and long tail, and Neddy felt very grand till they got to  the store; then troubles began. He put Jocko on a table near the door,  and told him to stay there while he did his errands. Now, close by was  the place where the candy was kept, and Jocko loved sweeties like any  girl; so he hopped along, and began to eat whatever he liked. Some boys  tried to stop him; and then he got angry at them for pulling his tail,  and threw handfuls of sugarplums at them. That was great fun; and the  more they laughed and scrambled and poked at him, the faster he showered  chocolates, caramels, and peppermints over them, till it looked as if  it had rained candy. The man was busy with Neddy at the other end of the  store; but when he heard the noise, both ran to see what was the matter.  Neither of them could stop naughty Jocko, who liked this game, and ran  up on the high shelves among the toys. Then down came little tubs and  dolls' stoves, tin trumpets and cradles, while boxes of leaden soldiers  and whole villages flew through the air, smash, bang, rattle, bump,  all over the floor. The man scolded, Neddy cried, the boys shouted, and  there was a lively time in that shop till a good slapping with a long  stick made Jock tumble into a tub of water where some curious fishes  lived, and then they caught him.    Neddy was much ashamed, and told the man his aunt would pay for all the  broken things. Then he took his naughty pet, and started to go home and  tie him up, for it was plain this monkey was not to be trusted. But as  soon as they got out, Jocko ran up a tree and dropped on to a load of  hay passing underneath. Here he danced and pranced, and had a fine time,  throwing off the man's coat and rake, and eating some of the dinner tied  up in a cloth. The crusts of bread and the bones he threw at the horse;  this new kind of whip frightened the horse, and he ran away down a steep  hill, and upset the hay and broke the cart. Oh, such a time! It was  worse than the candy scrape; for the man swore, and the horse was hurt,  and people said the monkey ought to be shot, he did so much mischief.  Jocko didn't care a bit; he sat high up in a tree, and chattered and  scolded, and swung by his tail, and was so droll that people couldn't  help laughing at him. Poor Neddy cried again, and went home to tell his  troubles to Aunt Jane, fearing that it would take all the money in his  bank to pay for the damage the bad monkey had done in one hour.    As soon as he was alone Jocko came skipping along, and jumped on his  back, and peeped at him, and patted his cheeks, and was so cunning and  good Neddy couldn't whip him; but he shut him up in a closet to punish  him.    Jocko was tired; so he went to sleep, and all was quiet till  dinner-time. They were ready for the pudding, and Neddy had saved a  place for a good plateful, as he liked snow-pudding, when shrieks were  heard in the kitchen, and Mary the maid rushed in to say,--    \"Oh, ma'am, that horrid beast has spoilt the pudding, and is scaring  Katy out of her life!\"    They all ran; and there sat that naughty monkey on the table, throwing  the nice white snow all over poor cook, till her face looked as if she  was ready to be shaved. His own face looked the same, for he had eaten  all he wanted while the pudding stood cooling in the pantry. He had  crept out of a window in the closet, and had a fine rummage among the  sugar-buckets, butter-boxes, and milk-pans.    Kate wailed, and Mary scolded; but Aunt Jane and grandpa laughed, and  Neddy chased Jock into the garden with the broom. They had to eat bread  and jelly for dessert, and it took the girls a long time to clear up the  mess the rascal made.    \"We will put his collar and chain on again, and keep him tied up all the  time till the man comes,\" said Aunt Jane.    \"But I can't catch him,\" sighed Neddy, watching the little imp whisk  about in the garden among the currant-bushes, chasing hens and tossing  green apples round in high glee.    \"Sit quietly down somewhere and wait till he is tired; then he will come  to you, and you can hold him fast,\" said Aunt Jane.    So Neddy waited; and though he was much worried at his new pet's  naughtiness, he enjoyed his pranks like a boy.    Grandpa took naps in the afternoon on the piazza, and he was dozing  comfortably when Jocko swung down from the grape-vine by his long tail,  and tickled the old gentleman on the nose with a straw. Grandpa sneezed,  and opened one eye to brush away the fly as he supposed. Then he went to  sleep again, and Jocko dropped a caterpillar on his bald head; this made  him open the other eye to see what that soft, creepy thing could be.  Neddy couldn't help laughing, for he often wanted to do just such  things, but never dared, because grandpa was a very stern old gentleman,  and no one took liberties with him. Jocko wasn't afraid, however; and  presently he crept to the table, stole the glasses lying there, put them  on, and taking up the paper held it before him, chattering as if he were  reading it, as he had seen people do. Neddy laughed out loud at this,  and clapped his hands, Jocko looked so like a little old man, in spite  of the tail curled up behind. This time grandpa opened both eyes at  once, and stared as if he saw a hobgoblin before him; then he snatched  off the spectacles, and caught up his cane, crying angrily,--    \"You rascal, how dare you!\"    But Jocko tossed the paper in his face, and with one jump lighted on  the back of old Tom, the big yellow cat, who lay asleep close by. Scared  half out of his wits, Tom spit and bounced; but Jocko held fast to his  collar, and had a fine race round the garden, while the girls laughed  at the funny sight, and Neddy shouted, \"It's a circus; and there's the  monkey and the pony.\" Even grandpa smiled, especially when puss dashed  up a tree, and Jock tumbled off. He chased him, and they had a great  battle; but Tom's claws were sharp, and the monkey got a scratch on the  nose, and ran crying to Neddy for comfort.    \"Now, you naughty fellow, I'll chain you up, and stop these dreadful  tricks. But you are great fun, and I can't whip you,\" said the boy; for  he knew what it was to enjoy a holiday, and poor Jocko had not had one  for a long time.    Jocko ate some lunch, took a nap in the grass, and then was ready for  more frolics. Neddy had fastened him to a tree in the garden, so that  he could enjoy the sun and air, and catch grasshoppers if he liked. But  Jocko wanted something more; and presently Neddy, who was reading in his  hammock on the piazza, heard a great cackling among the hens, and looked  up to see the monkey swinging by his tail from a bough, holding the  great cock-a-doodle by his splendid tail, while all the twenty hens  clucked and cackled with wrath and fear at such a dreadful prank.    \"Now, that's too bad; I _will_ slap him this time,\" said Neddy, running  to save his handsome bird from destruction. But before he got there poor  cocky had pulled his fine tail-feathers all out in his struggles, and  when set free was so frightened and mortified that he ran away and hid  in the bushes, and the hens went to comfort him.    Neddy gave Jocko a good whipping,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7439"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#7)"],[1," a stone in the hall. And presently  it began to sing by itself, low and clear, and the harper stopped and  all were hushed.    And this was what the harp sung:      \"O yonder sits my father, the king,      Binnorie, O Binnorie;    And yonder sits my mother, the queen;      By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie,      \"And yonder stands my brother Hugh,      Binnorie, O Binnorie;    And by him, my William, false and true;      By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.\"    Then they all wondered, and the harper told them how he had seen the  princess lying drowned on the bank near the bonny mill-dams o'  Binnorie, and how he had afterwards made this harp out of her hair and  breast-bone. Just then the harp began singing again, and this was what  it sang out loud and clear:      \"And there sits my sister who drowned me    By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.\"    And the harp snapped and broke, and never sang more.

(_Springs upon the mouse and kills it._)          CAP O' RUSHES    Well, there was once a very rich gentleman, and he'd three daughters,  and he thought he'd see how fond they were of him. So he says to the  first, \"How much do you love me, my dear?\"    \"Why,\" says she, \"as I love my life.\"    \"That's good,\" says he.    So he says to the second, \"How much do _you_ love me, my dear?\"    \"Why,\" says she, \"better nor all the world.\"    \"That's good,\" says he.    So he says to the third, \"How much do _you_ love me, my dear?\"    \"Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt,\" says she.    Well, he was that angry. \"You don't love me at all,\" says he, \"and in  my house you stay no more.\" So he drove her out there and then, and shut  the door in her face.    Well, she went away on and on till she came to a fen, and there she  gathered a lot of rushes and made them into a kind of a sort of a  cloak with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her fine  clothes. And then she went on and on till she came to a great house.    \"Do you want a maid?\" says she.    \"No, we don't,\" said they.    \"I haven't nowhere to go,\" says she; \"and I ask no wages, and do any  sort of work,\" says she.    \"Well,\" says they, \"if you like to wash the pots and scrape the  saucepans you may stay,\" said they.    So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and  did all the dirty work. And because she gave no name they called her  \"Cap o' Rushes.\"    Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the  servants were allowed to go and look on at the grand people. Cap o'  Rushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed at home.    But when they were gone she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned  herself, and went to the dance. And no one there was so finely dressed  as her.    Well, who should be there but her master's son, and what should he do  but fall in love with her the minute he set eyes on her. He wouldn't  dance with any one else.    But before the dance was done Cap o' Rushes slipt off, and away she went  home. And when the other maids came back she was pretending to be asleep  with her cap o' rushes on.    Well, next morning they said to her, \"You did miss a sight, Cap o'  Rushes!\"    \"What was that?\" says she.    \"Why, the beautifullest lady you ever see, dressed right gay and ga'.  The young master, he never took his eyes off her.\"    \"Well, I should have liked to have seen her,\" says Cap o' Rushes.    \"Well, there's to be another dance this evening, and perhaps she'll be  there.\"    But, come the evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go with  them. Howsoever, when they were gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes  and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance.    The master's son had been reckoning on seeing her, and he danced with  no one else, and never took his eyes off her. But, before the dance was  over, she slipt off, and home she went, and when the maids came back  she, pretended to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on.    Next day they said to her again, \"Well, Cap o' Rushes, you should ha'  been there to see the lady. There she was again, gay and ga', and the  young master he never took his eyes off her.\"    \"Well, there,\" says she, \"I should ha' liked to ha' seen her.\"    \"Well,\" says they, \"there's a dance again this evening, and you must go  with us, for she's sure to be there.\"    Well, come this evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, and  do what they would she stayed at home. But when they were gone she offed  with her cap o' rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to the  dance.    The master's son was rarely glad when he saw her. He danced with none  but her and never took his eyes off her. When she wouldn't tell him her  name, nor where she came from, he gave her a ring and told her if he  didn't see her again he should die.    Well, before the dance was over, off she slipped, and home she went, and  when the maids came home she was pretending to be asleep with her cap o'  rushes on.    Well, next day they says to her, \"There, Cap o' Rushes, you didn't come  last night, and now you won't see the lady, for there's no more dances.\"    \"Well I should have rarely liked to have seen her,\" says she.    The master's son he tried every way to find out where the lady was gone,  but go where he might, and ask whom he might, he never heard anything  about her. And he got worse and worse for the love of her till he had to  keep his bed.    \"Make some gruel for the young master,\" they said to the cook. \"He's  dying for the love of the lady.\" The cook she set about making it when  Cap o' Rushes came in.    \"What are you a-doing of?\", says she.    \"I'm going to make some gruel for the young master,\" says the cook, \"for  he's dying for love of the lady.\"    \"Let me make it,\" says Cap o' Rushes.    Well, the cook wouldn't at first, but at last she said yes, and Cap o'  Rushes made the gruel. And when she had made it she slipped the ring  into it on the sly before the cook took it upstairs.    The young man he drank it and then he saw the ring at the bottom.    \"Send for the cook,\" says he.    So up she comes.    \"Who made this gruel here?\" says he.    \"I did,\" says the cook, for she was frightened.    And he looked at her,    \"No, you didn't,\" says he. \"Say who did it, and you shan't be harmed.\"    \"Well, then, 'twas Cap o' Rushes,\" says she.    \"Send Cap o' Rushes here,\" says he.    So Cap o' Rushes came.    \"Did you make my gruel?\" says he.    \"Yes, I did,\" says she.    \"Where did you get this ring?\" says he.    \"From him that gave it me,\" says she.    \"Who are you, then?\" says the young man.    \"I'll show you,\" says she. And she offed with her cap o' rushes, and  there she was in her beautiful clothes.    Well, the master's son he got well very soon, and they were to be  married in a little time. It was to be a very grand wedding, and every  one was asked far and near. And Cap o' Rushes' father was asked. But she  never told anybody who she was.    But before the wedding she went to the cook, and says she:    \"I want you to dress every dish without a mite o' salt.\"    \"That'll be rare nasty,\" says the cook.    \"That doesn't signify,\" says she.    \"Very well,\" says the cook.    Well, the wedding-day came, and they were married. And after they were  married all the company sat down to the dinner. When they began to eat  the meat, that was so tasteless they couldn't eat it. But Cap o' Rushes'  father he tried first one dish and then another, and then he burst out  crying.    \"What is the matter?\" said the master's son to him.    \"Oh!\" says he, \"I had a daughter. And I asked her how much she loved me.  And she said 'As much as fresh meat loves salt.' And I turned her from  my door, for I thought she didn't love me. And now I see she loved me  best of all. And she may be dead for aught I know.\"    \"No, father, here she is!\" says Cap o' Rushes. And she goes up to him  and puts her arms round him.    And so they were happy ever after.          TEENY-TINY    Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny woman lived in a teeny-tiny  house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day this teeny-tiny woman put  on her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny house to take  a teeny-tiny walk. And when this teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-tiny  way she came to a teeny-tiny gate; so the teeny-tiny woman opened the  teeny-tiny gate, and went into a teeny-tiny churchyard.
