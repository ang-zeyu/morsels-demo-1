All this is not only untrue,  but it is, glaringly, the opposite of the truth; it is as wild as to  say that Dickens had not the boisterous masculinity of Jane Austen.  The whole force and triumph of Mr. Bernard Shaw lie in the fact that he  is a thoroughly consistent man. So far from his power consisting in  jumping through hoops or standing on his head, his power consists in  holding his own fortress night and day. He puts the Shaw test rapidly  and rigorously to everything that happens in heaven or earth.  His  standard never varies. The thing which weak-minded revolutionists and  weak-minded Conservatives really hate (and fear) in him, is exactly  this, that his scales, such as they are, are held even, and that his  law, such as it is, is justly enforced.  You may attack his principles,  as I do; but I do not know of any instance in which you can attack  their application. If he dislikes lawlessness, he dislikes the  lawlessness of Socialists as much as that of Individualists.  If he  dislikes the fever of patriotism, he dislikes it in Boers and Irishmen  as well as in Englishmen. If he dislikes the vows and bonds of  marriage, he dislikes still more the fiercer bonds and wilder vows that  are made by lawless love. If he laughs at the authority of priests, he  laughs louder at the pomposity of men of science.  If he condemns the  irresponsibility of faith, he condemns with a sane consistency the  equal irresponsibility of art. He has pleased all the bohemians by  saying that women are equal to men; but he has infuriated them by  suggesting that men are equal to women. He is almost mechanically just;  he has something of the terrible quality of a machine.  The man who is  really wild and whirling, the man who is really fantastic and  incalculable, is not Mr. Shaw, but the average Cabinet Minister.  It is  Sir Michael Hicks-Beach who jumps through hoops.  It is Sir Henry  Fowler who stands on his head. The solid and respectable statesman of  that type does really leap from position to position; he is really  ready to defend anything or nothing; he is really not to be taken  seriously. I know perfectly well what Mr. Bernard Shaw will be saying  thirty years hence; he will be saying what he has always said. If  thirty years hence I meet Mr. Shaw, a reverent being with a silver  beard sweeping the earth, and say to him, \"One can never, of course,  make a verbal attack upon a lady,\" the patriarch will lift his aged  hand and fell me to the earth. We know, I say, what Mr. Shaw will be,  saying thirty years hence. But is there any one so darkly read in stars  and oracles that he will dare to predict what Mr. Asquith will be  saying thirty years hence?    The truth is, that it is quite an error to suppose that absence of  definite convictions gives the mind freedom and agility. A man who  believes something is ready and witty, because he has all his weapons  about him.  He can apply his test in an instant. The man engaged in  conflict with a man like Mr. Bernard Shaw may fancy he has ten faces;  similarly a man engaged against a brilliant duellist may fancy that the  sword of his foe has turned to ten swords in his hand.  But this is not  really because the man is playing with ten swords, it is because he is  aiming very straight with one. Moreover, a man with a definite belief  always appears bizarre, because he does not change with the world; he  has climbed into a fixed star, and the earth whizzes below him like a  zoetrope. Millions of mild black-coated men call themselves sane and  sensible merely because they always catch the fashionable insanity,  because they are hurried into madness after madness by the maelstrom of  the world.    People accuse Mr. Shaw and many much sillier persons of \"proving that  black is white.\"  But they never ask whether the current  colour-language is always correct.  Ordinary sensible phraseology  sometimes calls black white, it certainly calls yellow white and green  white and reddish-brown white. We call wine \"white wine\" which is as  yellow as a Blue-coat boy's legs. We call grapes \"white grapes\" which  are manifestly pale green. We give to the European, whose complexion is  a sort of pink drab, the horrible title of a \"white man\"--a picture  more blood-curdling than any spectre in Poe.    Now, it is undoubtedly true that if a man asked a waiter in a  restaurant for a bottle of yellow wine and some greenish-yellow grapes,  the waiter would think him mad.  It is undoubtedly true that if a  Government official, reporting on the Europeans in Burmah, said, \"There  are only two thousand pinkish men here\" he would be accused of cracking  jokes, and kicked out of his post.  But it is equally obvious that both  men would have come to grief through telling the strict truth. That too  truthful man in the restaurant; that too truthful man in Burmah, is Mr.  Bernard Shaw.  He appears eccentric and grotesque because he will not  accept the general belief that white is yellow. He has based all his  brilliancy and solidity upon the hackneyed, but yet forgotten, fact  that truth is stranger than fiction. Truth, of course, must of  necessity be stranger than fiction, for we have made fiction to suit  ourselves.    So much then a reasonable appreciation will find in Mr. Shaw to be  bracing and excellent.  He claims to see things as they are; and some  things, at any rate, he does see as they are, which the whole of our  civilization does not see at all. But in Mr. Shaw's realism there is  something lacking, and that thing which is lacking is serious.    Mr. Shaw's old and recognized philosophy was that powerfully presented  in \"The Quintessence of Ibsenism.\"  It was, in brief, that conservative  ideals were bad, not because they were conservative, but because they  were ideals.  Every ideal prevented men from judging justly the  particular case; every moral generalization oppressed the individual;  the golden rule was there was no golden rule. And the objection to this  is simply that it pretends to free men, but really restrains them from  doing the only thing that men want to do. What is the good of telling a  community that it has every liberty except the liberty to make laws?  The liberty to make laws is what constitutes a free people.  And what  is the good of telling a man (or a philosopher) that he has every  liberty except the liberty to make generalizations.  Making  generalizations is what makes him a man. In short, when Mr. Shaw  forbids men to have strict moral ideals, he is acting like one who  should forbid them to have children. The saying that \"the golden rule  is that there is no golden rule,\" can, indeed, be simply answered by  being turned round. That there is no golden rule is itself a golden  rule, or rather it is much worse than a golden rule.  It is an iron  rule; a fetter on the first movement of a man.    But the sensation connected with Mr. Shaw in recent years has been his  sudden development of the religion of the Superman. He who had to all  appearance mocked at the faiths in the forgotten past discovered a new  god in the unimaginable future.  He who had laid all the blame on  ideals set up the most impossible of all ideals, the ideal of a new  creature.  But the truth, nevertheless, is that any one who knows Mr.  Shaw's mind adequately, and admires it properly, must have guessed all  this long ago.    For the truth is that Mr. Shaw has never seen things as they really  are. If he had he would have fallen on his knees before them. He has  always had a secret ideal that has withered all the things of this  world.  He has all the time been silently comparing humanity with  something that was not human, with a monster from Mars, with the Wise  Man of the Stoics, with the Economic Man of the Fabians, with Julius  Caesar, with Siegfried, with the Superman.  Now, to have this inner and  merciless standard may be a very good thing, or a very bad one, it may  be excellent or unfortunate, but it is not seeing things as they are.  It is not seeing things as they are to think first of a Briareus with a  hundred hands, and then call every man a cripple for only having two.  It is not seeing things as they are to start with a vision of Argus  with his hundred eyes, and then jeer at every man with two eyes as if  he had only one. And it is not seeing things as they are to imagine a  demigod of infinite mental clarity, who may or may not appear in the  latter days of the earth, and then to see all men as idiots.  And this  is what Mr. Shaw has always in some degree done.  When we really see  men as they are, we do not criticise, but worship; and very rightly.  For a monster with mysterious eyes and miraculous thumbs, with strange  dreams in his skull, and a queer tenderness for this place or that  baby, is truly a wonderful and unnerving matter. It is only the quite  arbitrary and priggish habit of comparison with something else which  makes it possible to be at our ease in front of him. A sentiment of  superiority keeps us cool and practical; the mere facts would make our  knees knock under as with religious fear.  It is the fact that every  instant of conscious life is an unimaginable prodigy. It is the fact  that every face in the street has the incredible unexpectedness of a  fairy-tale. The thing which prevents a man from realizing this is not  any clear-sightedness or experience, it is simply a habit of pedantic  and fastidious comparisons between one thing and another.  Mr. Shaw, on  the practical side perhaps the most humane man alive, is in this sense  inhumane. He has even been infected to some extent with the primary  intellectual weakness of his new master, Nietzsche, the strange notion  that the greater and stronger a man was the more he would despise other  things.  The greater and stronger a man is the more he would be  inclined to prostrate himself before a periwinkle.

Smith (#7)"],[1,"and those who simply  repent not and reject the gospel in the flesh. Of these latter it is  written, \"they shall be brought forth by the resurrection of the dead,  through the triumph and the glory of the Lamb,\" and \"shall be redeemed  in the due time of the Lord after the sufferings of his wrath.\" But of  the others it is said, \"they shall not be redeemed,\" for \"they are the  only ones on whom the second death shall have any power.\" The others,  never having been redeemed from the first, cannot be doomed to the  second death, or in other words cannot be made to suffer eternally  the wrath of God, without hope of redemption through repentance, but  must continue to suffer the first death until they repent, and are  redeemed therefrom through the power of the atonement and the gospel  of salvation, thereby being brought to the possession of all the keys  and blessings to which they will be capable of attaining or to which  they may be entitled, through the mercy, justice and power of the  everlasting God; or, on the other {20} hand, forever remain bound in  the chains of spiritual darkness, bondage and banishment from his  presence, kingdom and glory. The \"temporal death\" is one thing, and  the \"spiritual death\" is another thing. The body may be dissolved and  become extinct as an organism, although the elements of which it is  composed are indestructible or eternal, but I hold it as self-evident  that the spiritual organism is an eternal, immortal being, destined  to enjoy eternal happiness and a fulness of joy, or suffer the wrath  of God, and misery--a just condemnation, eternally. Adam became  spiritually dead, yet he lived to endure it until freed therefrom by  the power of the atonement, through repentance, etc. Those upon whom  the second death shall fall will live to suffer and endure it, but  without hope of redemption. The death of the body, or natural death, is  but a temporary circumstance to which all were subjected through the  fall, and from which all will be restored or resurrected by the power  of God, through the atonement of Christ.    Man existed before he came to this earth, and he will exist after he  passes from it; and will continue to live throughout the countless ages  of eternity.    There are three classes of beings; or rather, man exists in three  separate conditions, before and after his probation upon this  earth--first, in the spirit or pre-existent state; second, in the  disembodied state, the condition which exists after the dissolution of  the body and spirit until the resurrection take place; and third, in  the resurrected state. For instance, some two thousand years before  the coming of Christ into the world to sojourn in the flesh, he showed  himself to the brother of Jared and said, \"Behold, this body, which ye  now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the  body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit,  will I appear unto my people in the flesh.\" He further declared,  \"Behold, I am he who {21} was prepared from the foundation of the world  to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ.\"    Here Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the  manner and in the likeness of the same body, even as he showed himself  unto the Nephites--that is, prior to his coming in the flesh. This I  consider typical of the first condition of all spirits. Again it is  written, \"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for  the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the  flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: by which also he went and preached  unto the spirits in prison: which sometime were disobedient, when  once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the  ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by  water,\" etc. Thus we see that while the body of our Savior slept in  the tomb, he went in the spirit and preached his glorious gospel to  \"the spirits in prison,\" who were disobedient in the days of Noah,  and were destroyed in the flesh by the flood. This was their second  condition or state in the spirit, awaiting the resurrection of their  bodies which were slumbering in death. \"Marvel not at this:\" saith  Jesus, \"for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves  shall hear his [the Redeemer's] voice, and shall come forth; they that  have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done  evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" In reference to the third  condition or state, we will refer to the account given of the risen  Redeemer before his ascension. John tells us that he appeared unto his  disciples three times after his resurrection, on which occasions he  ate bread, broiled fish and honeycomb, and opened the eyes of their  understanding, that they began to comprehend the Scriptures and the  prophecies concerning Christ. But when he appeared unto them they were  terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.  And he said unto them, \"Why {22} are ye troubled? and why do thoughts  arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself:  handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me  have.\" Here is presented the true type of the resurrected being. And  after this manner are all those who have their resurrected bodies, and  there are many of these, for we are told in the scriptures that \"the  graves were opened, and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and  came out of the graves, after his resurrection, and went into the holy  city and appeared unto many.\" This class of beings dwell in heaven, or  in the paradise of the just, having been counted worthy to come forth  in the first resurrection, even with Christ, to dwell with him and to  be associated with the members of the kingdom of God and his Christ.  These comprise the three conditions or estates of man in heaven. Not  all, however, of the disembodied spirits enjoy the same privileges,  exaltation and glory. The spirits of the wicked, disobedient, and  unbelieving, are denied the privileges, joys and glory of the spirits  of the just and good. The bodies of the Saints will come forth in the  first resurrection, and those of the unbelieving, etc., in the second,  or last. In other words, the Saints will rise first, and those who are  not Saints will not rise until afterwards, according to the wisdom,  justice and mercy of God.    Christ is the great example for all mankind, and I believe that  mankind were as much foreordained to become like him, as that he was  foreordained to be the Redeemer of man. \"Whom God did foreknow\"--and  whom did he not foreknow?--\"he also did predestinate to be conformed  to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many  brethren.\" It is very plain that mankind are very far from being  like Christ, as the world is today, only in form of person. In this  we are like him, or in the form of his person, as he is the express  image of his Father's person. We are therefore in the form of God,  physically, and may {23} become like him spiritually, and like him in  the possession of knowledge, intelligence, wisdom and power.    The grand object of our coming to this earth is that we may become like  Christ, for if we are not like him, we cannot become the sons of God,  and be joint heirs with Christ.    The man who passes through this probation, and is faithful, being  redeemed from sin by the blood of Christ, through the ordinances of the  gospel, and attains to exaltation in the kingdom of God, is not less  but greater than the angels, and if you doubt it, read your Bible, for  there it is written that the Saints shall \"judge angels,\" and also they  shall \"judge the world.\" And why? Because the resurrected, righteous  man has progressed beyond the pre-existent or disembodied spirits, and  has risen above them, having both spirit and body as Christ has, having  gained the victory over death and the grave, and having power over sin  and Satan; in fact, having passed from the condition of the angels to  that of a God. He possesses keys of power, dominion and glory that  the angel does not possess--and cannot possess without gaining them  in the same way that he gained them, which will be by passing through  the same ordeals and proving equally faithful. It was so ordained when  the morning stars sang together, before the foundations of this earth  were laid. Man in his pre-existent condition is not perfect, neither  is he in the disembodied estate. There is no perfect estate but that  of the risen Redeemer, which is God's estate, and no man can become  perfect except he become like the Gods. And what are they like? I have  shown what Christ is like, and he is like his Father, but I will refer  to an undoubted authority to this people, on this point: \"The Father  has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but  the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage  of Spirit, were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.\"  (Doc. {24} and Cov., Sec. 130.) There is not time to refer to the many  scriptural passages which might be cited in proof of these important  facts, enough already have been referred to, to place the matter beyond  a doubt.    It is believed by many, in the Christian world, that our Savior  finished his mission when he expired upon the cross, and his last  words on the cross, as given by the Apostle John--\"It is finished,\"  are frequently quoted as evidence of the fact; but this is an error.  Christ did not complete his mission upon the earth until after his body  was raised from the dead. Had his mission been completed when he died,  his disciples would have continued fishermen, carpenters, etc., for  they returned to their several occupations soon after the crucifixion,  not yet knowing the force of their holy calling, nor understanding the  mission assigned them by their Master,"]]]
