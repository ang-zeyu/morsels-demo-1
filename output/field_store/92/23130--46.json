O'er what vast lakes that stretch superbly dead,    Till lashed to life by storm-clouds, have they flown?  In what wild lands, in laggard flight have led    Their aerial career unseen, unknown,    'Till now with twilight come their cries in lonely monotone?    The flapping of their pinions in the air    Dies in the hush of distance, while they light  Within the fir tops, weirdly black and bare,    That stand with giant strength and peerless height,    To shelter fairy, bird and beast throughout the closing night.    Strange black and princely pirates of the skies,    Would that your wind-tossed travels I could know!  Would that my soul could see, and, seeing, rise    To unrestricted life where ebb and flow    Of Nature's pulse would constitute a wider life below!    Could I but live just here in Freedom's arms,    A kingly life without a sovereign's care!  Vain dreams! Day hides with closing wings her charms,    And all is cradled in repose, save where    Yon band of black, belated crows still frets the evening air.        MOONSET      Idles the night wind through the dreaming firs,  That waking murmur low,  As some lost melody returning stirs  The love of long ago;  And through the far, cool distance, zephyr fanned.  The moon is sinking into shadow-land.    The troubled night-bird, calling plaintively,  Wanders on restless wing;  The cedars, chanting vespers to the sea,  Await its answering,  That comes in wash of waves along the strand,  The while the moon slips into shadow-land.    O! soft responsive voices of the night  I join your minstrelsy,  And call across the fading silver light  As something calls to me;  I may not all your meaning understand,  But I have touched your soul in shadow-land.        MARSHLANDS      A thin wet sky, that yellows at the rim,  And meets with sun-lost lip the marsh's brim.    The pools low lying, dank with moss and mould,  Glint through their mildews like large cups of gold.    Among the wild rice in the still lagoon,  In monotone the lizard shrills his tune.    The wild goose, homing, seeks a sheltering,  Where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling.    Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight,  Sail up the silence with the nearing night.    And like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil,  Steals twilight and its shadows o'er the swale.    Hushed lie the sedges, and the vapours creep,  Thick, grey and humid, while the marshes sleep.        JOE      AN ETCHING    A meadow brown; across the yonder edge  A zigzag fence is ambling; here a wedge  Of underbush has cleft its course in twain,  Till where beyond it staggers up again;  The long, grey rails stretch in a broken line  Their ragged length of rough, split forest pine,  And in their zigzag tottering have reeled  In drunken efforts to enclose the field,  Which carries on its breast, September born,  A patch of rustling, yellow, Indian corn.  Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon  The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler's son,  A little semi-savage boy of nine.  Now dozing in the warmth of Nature's wine,  His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought,  By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought  Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there  A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair  Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through,  And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue.  Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest,  His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest,  Both hardy hands within their usual nest--  His breeches pockets--so, he waits to rest  His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn,  That all day long were husking Indian corn.  His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound,  With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground,  Then with an idle whistle lifts his load  And shambles home along the country road  That stretches on, fringed out with stumps and weeds,  And finally unto the backwoods leads,  Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough  The axe of pioneer, the settler's plough.        SHADOW RIVER      MUSKOKA    A stream of tender gladness,  Of filmy sun, and opal tinted skies;  Of warm midsummer air that lightly lies  In mystic rings,  Where softly swings  The music of a thousand wings  That almost tones to sadness.    Midway 'twixt earth and heaven,  A bubble in the pearly air, I seem  To float upon the sapphire floor, a dream  Of clouds of snow,  Above, below,  Drift with my drifting, dim and slow,  As twilight drifts to even.    The little fern-leaf, bending  Upon the brink, its green reflection greets,  And kisses soft the shadow that it meets  With touch so fine,  The border line  The keenest vision can't define;  So perfect is the blending.    The far, fir trees that cover  The brownish hills with needles green and gold,  The arching elms o'erhead, vinegrown and old,  Repictured are  Beneath me far,  Where not a ripple moves to mar  Shades underneath, or over.    Mine is the undertone;  The beauty, strength, and power of the land  Will never stir or bend at my command;  But all the shade  Is marred or made,  If I but dip my paddle blade;  And it is mine alone.    O! pathless world of seeming!  O! pathless life of mine whose deep ideal  Is more my own than ever was the real.  For others Fame  And Love's red flame,  And yellow gold: I only claim  The shadows and the dreaming.        RAINFALL      From out the west, where darkling storm-clouds float,  The 'waking wind pipes soft its rising note.    From out the west, o'erhung with fringes grey,  The wind preludes with sighs its roundelay,    Then blowing, singing, piping, laughing loud,  It scurries on before the grey storm-cloud;    Across the hollow and along the hill  It whips and whirls among the maples, till    With boughs upbent, and green of leaves blown wide,  The silver shines upon their underside.    A gusty freshening of humid air,  With showers laden, and with fragrance rare;    And now a little sprinkle, with a dash  Of great cool drops that fall with sudden splash;    Then over field and hollow, grass and grain,  The loud, crisp whiteness of the nearing rain.        UNDER CANVAS      IN MUSKOKA    Lichens of green and grey on every side;  And green and grey the rocks beneath our feet;  Above our heads the canvas stretching wide;  And over all, enchantment rare and sweet.    Fair Rosseau slumbers in an atmosphere  That kisses her to passionless soft dreams.  O! joy of living we have found thee here,  And life lacks nothing, so complete it seems.    The velvet air, stirred by some elfin wings,  Comes swinging up the waters and then stills  Its voice so low that floating by it sings  Like distant harps among the distant hills.    Across the lake the rugged islands lie,  Fir-crowned and grim; and further in the view  Some shadows seeming swung 'twixt cloud and sky,  Are countless shores, a symphony of blue.    Some northern sorceress, when day is done,  Hovers where cliffs uplift their gaunt grey steeps,  Bewitching to vermilion Rosseau's sun,  That in a liquid mass of rubies sleeps.    The scent of burning leaves, the camp-fire's blaze,  The great logs cracking in the brilliant flame,  The groups grotesque, on which the firelight plays,  Are pictures which Muskoka twilights frame.    And Night, star-crested, wanders up the mere  With opiates for idleness to quaff,  And while she ministers, far off I hear  The owl's uncanny cry, the wild loon's laugh.        THE BIRDS' LULLABY      I    Sing to us, cedars; the twilight is creeping    With shadowy garments, the wilderness through;  All day we have carolled, and now would be sleeping,    So echo the anthems we warbled to you;          While we swing, swing,          And your branches sing,      And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.    II    Sing to us, cedars; the night-wind is sighing,    Is wooing, is pleading, to hear you reply;  And here in your arms we are restfully lying,    And longing to dream to your soft lullaby;          While we swing, swing,          And your branches sing,      And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.    III    Sing to us, cedars; your voice is so lowly,    Your breathing so fragrant, your branches so strong;  Our little nest-cradles are swaying so slowly,    While zephyrs are breathing their slumberous song.          And we swing, swing,          While your branches sing,      And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.        OVERLOOKED      Sleep, with her tender balm, her touch so kind,          Has passed me by;  Afar I see her vesture, velvet-lined,          Float silently;  O! Sleep, my tired eyes had need of thee!  Is thy sweet kiss not meant to-night for me?    Peace, with the blessings that I longed for so,          Has passed me by;  Where'er she folds her holy wings I know          All tempests die;  O! Peace, my tired soul had need of thee!  Is thy sweet kiss denied alone to me?    Love, with her heated touches, passion-stirred,          Has passed me by.  I called, \"O stay thy flight,\" but all unheard          My lonely cry:  O! Love, my tired heart had need of thee!  Is thy sweet kiss withheld alone from me?    Sleep, sister-twin of Peace, my waking eyes          So weary grow!  O! Love, thou wanderer from Paradise,          Dost thou not know  How oft my lonely heart has cried to thee?  But Thou, and Sleep, and Peace, come not to me.        FASTING      'Tis morning now, yet silently I stand,  Uplift the curtain with a weary hand,  Look out while darkness overspreads the way,              And long for day.    Calm peace is frighted with my mood to-night,  Nor visits my dull chamber with her light,  To guide my senses into her sweet rest              And leave me blest.    Long hours since the city rocked and sung  Itself to slumber: only the stars swung  Aloft their torches in the midnight skies              With"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#7)"],[1,"main body; and the  line of the migrating hosts soon stretched from the Missouri to  the valley of the Great Salt Lake.  Wagons there were, as also  some horses and men, but all too few for the journey; and a great  part of the company walked the full thousand miles across the  great plains and the forbidding deserts of the west.  In the  Black Hills region, the pioneers were delayed a week at the  Platte, a stream, which, though usually fordable at this point  was now so swollen as to make fording impossible.  Here, too,  their provisions were well nigh exhausted.  Game had not been  plentiful, and the \"Mormon\" pioneers were threatened with the  direst privations.  In their slow march they had been passed by a  number of well-equipped parties, some of them from Missouri bound  for the Pacific; but most of these were overtaken on the easterly  side of the river.  Amongst the effects of the \"Mormon\" party was  a leathern boat, which on water served the legitimate purpose of  its maker and on land was made to do service as a wagon box.  This, together with rafts specially constructed, was now put to  good use in ferrying across the river not alone themselves and  their little property, but the other companies and their loads.  For this service they were well paid in camp provisions.    Thus, the expatriated pioneers found themselves relieved from  want with their meal sacks replenished in the heart of the  wilderness.  Many may call it superstition, but some will regard  it as did the thankful travelers--an interposition of Providence,  and an answer to their prayers--an event to be compared, they  said, to the feeding of Israel with manna in the wilderness of  old.    After over three months' journeying, the pioneer company reached  the valley of the Great Salt Lake; and at the first sight of it,  Brigham Young declared it to be the halting place--the gathering  center for the Saints.  But what was there inviting in this  wilderness spread out like a scroll barren of inviting message,  and empty but for the picture it presented of wondrous scenic  grandeur?  Looking from the Wasatch barrier, the colonists gazed  upon a scene of entrancing though forbidding beauty.  A barren,  arid plain, rimmed by mountains like a literal basin, still  occupied in its lowest parts by the dregs of what had once filled  it to the brim; no green meadows, not a tree worthy the name,  scarce a patch of greensward to entice the adventurous wanderers  into the valley.  The slopes were covered with sagebrush,  relieved by patches of chaparral oak and squaw-bush; the wild  sunflower lent its golden hue to intensify the sharp contrasts.  Off to the westward lay the lake, making an impressive,  uninviting picture in its severe, unliving beauty; from its blue  wastes somber peaks rose as precipitous islands, and about the  shores of this dead sea were saline flats that told of the  scorching heat and thirsty atmosphere of this parched region.  A  turbid river ran from south to north athwart the valley,  \"dividing it in twain,\" as a historian of the day has written,  \"as if the vast bowl in the intense heat of the Master Potter's  fires, in process of formation had cracked asunder.\"  Small  streams of water started in rippling haste from the snow-caps of  the mountains toward the lake, but most of them were devoured by  the thirsty sands of the valley before their journey was half  completed.    Such was the scene of desolation that greeted the pioneer band.  A more forsaken spot they had not passed in all their wanderings.  And is this the promised land?  This is the very place of which  Bridger spake when he proffered a thousand dollars in gold for  the first bushel of grain that could be raised here.  With such a  Canaan spread out before them, was it not wholly pardonable if  some did sigh with longing for the leeks and flesh-pots of the  Egypt they had left, or wished to pass by this land and seek a  fairer home?  Two of the three women who belonged to the party  were utterly disappointed.  \"Weak, worn, and weary as I am,\" said  one of these heroines, \"I would rather push on another thousand  miles than stay here.\"    But the voice of their leader was heard.  \"The very place,\" said  Brigham Young, and in his prophetic mind there rose a vision of  what was to come.  Not for a moment did he doubt the future.  He  saw a multitude of towns and cities, hamlets and villas filling  this and neighboring valleys, with the fairest of all, a city  whose beauty of situation, whose wealth of resource should become  known throughout the world, rising from the most arid site of the  burning desert before him, hard by the barren salt shores of the  watery waste.  There in the very heart of the parched wilderness  should stand the House of the Lord, with other temples in valleys  beyond the horizon of his gaze.    Within a few hours after the arrival of the vanguard upon the  banks of what is now known as City Creek--the mountain stream  which today furnishes Salt Lake City part of her water  supply--plows were put to work; but the hard-baked soil, never  before disturbed by the efforts of man to till, refused to yield  to the share.  A dam was thrown across the stream and the  softening liquid was spread upon the flat that had been chosen  for the first fields.  The planting season had already well nigh  passed, and not a day could be lost.  Potatoes and other seed  were put in, and the land was again flooded.  Such was the  beginning of the irrigation system, which soon became  co-extensive with the area occupied by the \"Mormon\" settlers, a  system which under the blessing of Providence, has proved to be  the veritable magic touch by which the desert has been made a  field of richness and a garden of beauty; a system which now  after many decades of successful trial is held up by the nation's  wise and great ones to be the one practicable method of  reclaiming our country's vast domains of arid lands.  It was on  the 24th of July, 1847, that the main part of the pioneer band  entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and that day of the  year is observed as a legal holiday in Utah.  From that time to  the present, the stream of immigration to these valleys has never  ceased.        CHAPTER IV    The dangers of the first company's migration were surpassed by  those of parties who subsequently braved the terrors of the  plains.  In their enthusiasm to reach the gathering place of  their people, many of the Latter-day Saints set out from Iowa,  where railway facilities had their termination, with hand-carts  only as a means of conveyance.  Today there are living in the  smiling vales of Utah, men and women who then as boys and girls  trudged wearily across the prairies, dragging the lumbering carts  that contained their entire provision against starvation and  freezing.  Such handcart companies were organized with care; a  limited amount of freight was allowed to each division; milch  cattle and a very few draft-animals, with wagons for conveying  the heavier baggage and to carry the sick, were assigned.  The  tale of those dreary marches has never yet been told; the song of  the heroism and sacrifice displayed by these pilgrims for  conscience sake is awaiting a singer worthy the theme.  Wading  the streams with carts in tow, or in cases of unfordable streams,  stopping to construct rafts; at times living on reduced rations  of but a few ounces of meal per day; lying down at night with a  prayer in the heart that they wake no more on earth, a prayer  which had its fulfilment in hundreds of cases; the dying heaving  their parting sighs in the arms of loved ones who were soon to  follow, they journeyed on.    The inevitable catastrophes and accidents of travel robbed them  of their substance.  Hostile savages stampeded their cattle, or  openly attacked and plundered the trains.  But on they went,  never swerving from the course.  These later companies needed no  chart nor compass to guide them over the desert; the road was  plain from the marks of former camps, and yet more so from the  graves of friends and loved ones who had started before on the  road to the earthly Zion and found that it led them to the  martyr's entrance to heaven, graves that were marked perhaps but  by a rude inscription cut on a pole or a board.  And even these  narrow lodgings had not been left inviolate; the wolves of the  plains had too often succeeded in unearthing and rending the  bodies.  Every company thus made the course the plainer; each of  them added to the silent population of the desert; sometimes half  a score were interred at one camp, and of one company over a  fourth were thus left beside the prairie road.  Now we traverse  the self-same track in a day and a night, reclining on luxurious  cushions of ease, covering fifty miles while dining in luxury;  and we avert the ennui of the journey by berating the railway  company for lack of speed.    Relief trains were continually on the way between the valley of  the Salt Lake and the Missouri; and the remnants of many a  company were saved from what appeared to be certain destruction  by the opportune arrival of these rescuing parties.  Such relief  came from those who were themselves destitute and almost  starving.  Brigham Young with a few of the chief officials of the  Church, and aids, returned eastward on such an errand of rescue  within a few weeks after first reaching the valley.  The region  to which the early settlers came was in no wise a typical land of  promise; it did not flow spontaneously with milk and honey.    Drought and unseasonable frosts made the first year's farming  experiments but doubtful successes, and in the succeeding spring  the land was visited by the devastating plague of the Rocky  Mountain crickets.  They swarmed down in innumerable hordes upon  the fields, destroying the growing crops as they advanced,  devouring all before them, leaving the land a desert in their  track.  The"]]]
