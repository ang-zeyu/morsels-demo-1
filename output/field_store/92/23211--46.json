[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7298"],[0,"William Tell Told Again (#7)"],[1,"  the ruler of a country--myself, for instance. A low, common fellow--if  you will excuse the description--like yourself only grows proud through  being armed, and so offends those above him. But, of course, it's no  business of mine. I am only telling you what I think about it.  Personally, I like to encourage my subjects to shoot; that is why I am  giving you such a splendid mark to shoot at. You see, Tell?\"    Tell did not reply. He raised his bow and pointed it. There was a stir  of excitement in the crowd, more particularly in that part of the crowd  which stood on his right, for, his hand trembling for the first time in  his life, Tell had pointed his arrow, not at his son, but straight into  the heart of the crowd.    [Illustration: PLATE XI]    \"Here! Hi! That's the wrong way! More to the left!\" shouted the people  in a panic, while Gessler roared with laughter, and bade Tell shoot and  chance it.    \"If you can't hit the apple or your son,\" he chuckled, \"you can bring  down one of your dear fellow-countrymen.\"    Tell lowered his bow, and a sigh of relief went through the crowd.    \"My eyes are swimming,\" he said; \"I cannot see.\"    Then he turned to the Governor.    \"I cannot shoot,\" he said; \"bid your soldiers kill me.\"    \"No,\" said Gessler--\"no, Tell. That is not at all what I want. If I had  wished my soldiers to kill you, I should not have waited for a formal  invitation from you. I have no desire to see you slain. Not at present.  I wish to see you shoot. Come, Tell, they say you can do everything,  and are afraid of nothing. Only the other day, I hear, you carried a  man, one Baumgartner--that was his name, I think--across a rough sea in  an open boat. You may remember it? I particularly wished to catch  Baumgartner, Tell. Now, this is a feat which calls for much less  courage. Simply to shoot an apple off a boy's head. A child could do  it.\"    While he was speaking, Tell had been standing in silence, his hands  trembling and his eyes fixed, sometimes on the Governor, sometimes on  the sky. He now seized his quiver, and taking from it a second arrow,  placed it in his belt. Gessler watched him, but said nothing.    \"Shoot, father!\" cried Walter from the other end of the lane; \"I'm not  afraid.\"    Tell, calm again now, raised his bow and took a steady aim. Everybody  craned forward, the front ranks in vain telling those behind that there  was nothing to be gained by pushing. Gessler bent over his horse's neck  and peered eagerly towards Walter. A great hush fell on all as Tell  released the string.    \"Phut!\" went the string, and the arrow rushed through the air.    A moment's suspense, and then a terrific cheer rose from the  spectators.    [Illustration: PLATE XII]    The apple had leaped from Walter's head, pierced through the centre.          CHAPTER XIII      Intense excitement instantly reigned. Their suspense over, the crowd  cheered again and again, shook hands with one another, and flung their  caps into the air. Everyone was delighted, for everyone was fond of  Tell and Walter. It also pleased them to see the Governor disappointed.  He had had things his own way for so long that it was a pleasant change  to see him baffled in this manner. Not since Switzerland became a  nation had the meadow outside the city gates been the scene of such  rejoicings.    Walter had picked up the apple with the arrow piercing it, and was  showing it proudly to all his friends.    \"I told you so,\" he kept saying; \"I knew father wouldn't hurt me.  Father's the best shot in all Switzerland.\"    \"That was indeed a shot!\" exclaimed Ulric the smith; \"it will ring  through the ages. While the mountains stand will the tale of Tell the  bowman be told.\"    Rudolph der Harras took the apple from Walter and showed it to Gessler,  who had been sitting transfixed on his horse.    \"See,\" he said, \"the arrow has passed through the very centre. It was a  master shot.\"    \"It was very nearly a 'Master Walter shot,'\" said Roesselmann the priest  severely, fixing the Governor with a stern eye.    Gessler made no answer. He sat looking moodily at Tell, who had dropped  his cross-bow and was standing motionless, still gazing in the  direction in which the arrow had sped. Nobody liked to be the first to  speak to him.    \"Well,\" said Rudolph der Harras, breaking an awkward silence, \"I  suppose it's all over now? May as well be moving, eh?\"    He bit a large piece out of the apple, which he still held. Walter  uttered a piercing scream as he saw the mouthful disappear. Up till now  he had shown no signs of dismay, in spite of the peril which he had had  to face; but when he watched Rudolph eating the apple, which he  naturally looked upon as his own property, he could not keep quiet any  longer. Rudolph handed him the apple with an apology, and he began to  munch it contentedly.    \"Come with me to your mother, my boy,\" said Roesselmann.    Walter took no notice, but went on eating the apple.    Tell came to himself with a start, looked round for Walter, and began  to lead him away in the direction of his home, deaf to all the cheering  that was going on around him.    Gessler leaned forward in his saddle.    \"Tell,\" he said, \"a word with you.\"    Tell came back.    \"Your Excellency?\"    \"Before you go I wish you to explain one thing.\"    \"A thousand, your Excellency.\"    \"No, only one. When you were getting ready to shoot at the apple you  placed an arrow in the string and a second arrow in your belt.\"    \"A second arrow!\" Tell pretended to be very much astonished, but the  pretence did not deceive the Governor.    \"Yes, a second arrow. Why was that? What did you intend to do with that  arrow, Tell?\"    Tell looked down uneasily, and twisted his bow about in his hands.    \"My lord,\" he said at last, \"it is a bowman's custom. All archers place  a second arrow in their belt.\"    \"No, Tell,\" said Gessler, \"I cannot take that answer as the truth. I  know there was some other meaning in what you did. Tell me the reason  without concealment. Why was it? Your life is safe, whatever it was, so  speak out. Why did you take out that second arrow?\"    Tell stopped fidgeting with his bow, and met the Governor's eye with a  steady gaze.    \"Since you promise me my life, your Excellency,\" he replied, drawing  himself up, \"I will tell you.\"    He drew the arrow from his belt and held it up.    The crowd pressed forward, hanging on his words.    \"Had my first arrow,\" said Tell slowly, \"pierced my child and not the  apple, this would have pierced you, my lord. Had I missed with my first  shot, be sure, my lord, that my second would have found its mark.\"    A murmur of approval broke from the crowd as Tell thrust the arrow back  into the quiver and faced the Governor with folded arms and burning  eyes. Gessler turned white with fury.    \"Seize that man!\" he shouted.    [Illustration: PLATE XIII]    \"My lord, bethink you,\" whispered Rudolph der Harras; \"you promised him  his life. Tell, fly!\" he cried.    Tell did not move.    \"Seize that man and bind him,\" roared Gessler once more. \"If he  resists, cut him down.\"    \"I shall not resist,\" said Tell scornfully. \"I should have known the  folly of trusting to a tyrant to keep his word. My death will at least  show my countrymen the worth of their Governor's promises.\"    \"Not so,\" replied Gessler; \"no man shall say I ever broke my knightly  word. I promised you your life, and I will give you your life. But you  are a dangerous man, Tell, and against such must I guard myself. You  have told me your murderous purpose. I must look to it that that  purpose is not fulfilled. Life I promised you, and life I will give  you. But of freedom I said nothing. In my castle at Kuessnacht there are  dungeons where no ray of sun or moon ever falls. Chained hand and foot  in one of these, you will hardly aim your arrows at me. It is rash,  Tell, to threaten those who have power over you. Soldiers, bind him and  lead him to my ship. I will follow, and will myself conduct him to  Kuessnacht.\"    The soldiers tied Tell's hands. He offered no resistance. And amidst  the groans of the people he was led away to the shore of the lake,  where Gessler's ship lay at anchor.    [Illustration: PLATE XIV]    \"Our last chance is gone,\" said the people to one another. \"Where shall  we look now for a leader?\"          CHAPTER XIV      The castle of Kuessnacht lay on the opposite side of the lake, a mighty  mass of stone reared on a mightier crag rising sheer out of the waves,  which boiled and foamed about its foot. Steep rocks of fantastic shape  hemmed it in, and many were the vessels which perished on these, driven  thither by the frequent storms that swept over the lake.    Gessler and his men, Tell in their midst, bound and unarmed, embarked  early in the afternoon at Flueelen, which was the name of the harbour  where the Governor's ship had been moored. Flueelen was about two miles  from Kuessnacht.    When they had arrived at the vessel they went on board, and Tell was  placed at the bottom of the hold. It was pitch dark, and rats scampered  over his body as he lay. The ropes were cast off, the sails filled, and  the ship made her way across the lake, aided by a favouring breeze.    A large number of the Swiss people had followed Tell and his captors to  the harbour, and stood gazing sorrowfully after the ship as it  diminished in the distance. There had been whispers of an attempted  rescue, but nobody had dared to begin it, and the whispers had led to  nothing. Few of the people carried weapons, and the soldiers were clad  in armour, and each bore a long pike or a sharp sword. As Arnold of  Sewa would have said if he had been present, what the people wanted was  prudence. It was useless to attack men so thoroughly able to defend  themselves.    Therefore the people looked on and groaned, but did nothing.    For some time the ship sped easily on her way and through a calm sea.  Tell lay below, listening to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#7)"],[1,"his clothes were awry.  He resembled a man who has  come from bed to go to a fire.  The hoofs of his horse often threatened  the heads of the running men, but they scampered with singular fortune.  In this rush they were apparently all deaf and blind.  They heeded not  the largest and longest of the oaths that were thrown at them from all  directions.    Frequently over this tumult could be heard the grim jokes of the  critical veterans; but the retreating men apparently were not even  conscious of the presence of an audience.    The battle reflection that shone for an instant in the faces on the mad  current made the youth feel that forceful hands from heaven would not  have been able to have held him in place if he could have got  intelligent control of his legs.    There was an appalling imprint upon these faces.  The struggle in the  smoke had pictured an exaggeration of itself on the bleached cheeks and  in the eyes wild with one desire.    The sight of this stampede exerted a floodlike force that seemed able  to drag sticks and stones and men from the ground.  They of the  reserves had to hold on.  They grew pale and firm, and red and quaking.    The youth achieved one little thought in the midst of this chaos.  The  composite monster which had caused the other troops to flee had not  then appeared.  He resolved to get a view of it, and then, he thought  he might very likely run better than the best of them.          Chapter 5      There were moments of waiting.  The youth thought of the village street  at home before the arrival of the circus parade on a day in the spring.  He remembered how he had stood, a small, thrillful boy, prepared to  follow the dingy lady upon the white horse, or the band in its faded  chariot.  He saw the yellow road, the lines of expectant people, and  the sober houses.  He particularly remembered an old fellow who used to  sit upon a cracker box in front of the store and feign to despise such  exhibitions.  A thousand details of color and form surged in his mind.  The old fellow upon the cracker box appeared in middle prominence.    Some one cried, \"Here they come!\"    There was rustling and muttering among the men.  They displayed a  feverish desire to have every possible cartridge ready to their hands.  The boxes were pulled around into various positions, and adjusted with  great care.  It was as if seven hundred new bonnets were being tried on.    The tall soldier, having prepared his rifle, produced a red  handkerchief of some kind.  He was engaged in knotting it about his  throat with exquisite attention to its position, when the cry was  repeated up and down the line in a muffled roar of sound.    \"Here they come!  Here they come!\"  Gun locks clicked.    Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown swarm of running men who  were giving shrill yells.  They came on, stooping and swinging their  rifles at all angles.  A flag, tilted forward, sped near the front.    As he caught sight of them the youth was momentarily startled by a  thought that perhaps his gun was not loaded.  He stood trying to rally  his faltering intellect so that he might recollect the moment when he  had loaded, but he could not.    A hatless general pulled his dripping horse to a stand near the colonel  of the 304th.  He shook his fist in the other's face.  \"You've got to  hold 'em back!\" he shouted, savagely; \"you've got to hold 'em back!\"    In his agitation the colonel began to stammer.  \"A-all r-right,  General, all right, by Gawd!  We-we 'll do our--we-we 'll d-d-do-do our  best, General.\"  The general made a passionate gesture and galloped  away.  The colonel, perchance to relieve his feelings, began to scold  like a wet parrot.  The youth, turning swiftly to make sure that the  rear was unmolested, saw the commander regarding his men in a highly  resentful manner, as if he regretted above everything his association  with them.    The man at the youth's elbow was mumbling, as if to himself: \"Oh, we  're in for it now! oh, we 're in for it now!\"    The captain of the company had been pacing excitedly to and fro in the  rear.  He coaxed in schoolmistress fashion, as to a congregation of  boys with primers.  His talk was an endless repetition.  \"Reserve your  fire, boys--don't shoot till I tell you--save your fire--wait till they  get close up--don't be damned fools--\"    Perspiration streamed down the youth's face, which was soiled like that  of a weeping urchin.  He frequently, with a nervous movement, wiped his  eyes with his coat sleeve.  His mouth was still a little ways open.    He got the one glance at the foe-swarming field in front of him, and  instantly ceased to debate the question of his piece being loaded.  Before he was ready to begin--before he had announced to himself that  he was about to fight--he threw the obedient well-balanced rifle into  position and fired a first wild shot.  Directly he was working at his  weapon like an automatic affair.    He suddenly lost concern for himself, and forgot to look at a menacing  fate.  He became not a man but a member.  He felt that something of  which he was a part--a regiment, an army, a cause, or a country--was in  crisis.  He was welded into a common personality which was dominated by  a single desire.  For some moments he could not flee no more than a  little finger can commit a revolution from a hand.    If he had thought the regiment was about to be annihilated perhaps he  could have amputated himself from it.  But its noise gave him  assurance.  The regiment was like a firework that, once ignited,  proceeds superior to circumstances until its blazing vitality fades.  It wheezed and banged with a mighty power.  He pictured the ground  before it as strewn with the discomfited.    There was a consciousness always of the presence of his comrades about  him.  He felt the subtle battle brotherhood more potent even than the  cause for which they were fighting.  It was a mysterious fraternity  born of the smoke and danger of death.    He was at a task.  He was like a carpenter who has made many boxes,  making still another box, only there was furious haste in his  movements.  He, in his thoughts, was careering off in other places,  even as the carpenter who as he works whistles and thinks of his friend  or his enemy, his home or a saloon.  And these jolted dreams were never  perfect to him afterward, but remained a mass of blurred shapes.    Presently he began to feel the effects of the war atmosphere--a  blistering sweat, a sensation that his eyeballs were about to crack  like hot stones.  A burning roar filled his ears.    Following this came a red rage.  He developed the acute exasperation of  a pestered animal, a well-meaning cow worried by dogs.  He had a mad  feeling against his rifle, which could only be used against one life at  a time.  He wished to rush forward and strangle with his fingers.  He  craved a power that would enable him to make a world-sweeping gesture  and brush all back.  His impotency appeared to him, and made his rage  into that of a driven beast.    Buried in the smoke of many rifles his anger was directed not so much  against the men whom he knew were rushing toward him as against the  swirling battle phantoms which were choking him, stuffing their smoke  robes down his parched throat.  He fought frantically for respite for  his senses, for air, as a babe being smothered attacks the deadly  blankets.    There was a blare of heated rage mingled with a certain expression of  intentness on all faces.  Many of the men were making low-toned noises  with their mouths, and these subdued cheers, snarls, imprecations,  prayers, made a wild, barbaric song that went as an undercurrent of  sound, strange and chantlike with the resounding chords of the war  march.  The man at the youth's elbow was babbling.  In it there was  something soft and tender like the monologue of a babe. The tall  soldier was swearing in a loud voice.  From his lips came a black  procession of curious oaths.  Of a sudden another broke out in a  querulous way like a man who has mislaid his hat. \"Well, why don't they  support us?  Why don't they send supports? Do they think--\"    The youth in his battle sleep heard this as one who dozes hears.    There was a singular absence of heroic poses.  The men bending and  surging in their haste and rage were in every impossible attitude.  The  steel ramrods clanked and clanged with incessant din as the men pounded  them furiously into the hot rifle barrels.  The flaps of the cartridge  boxes were all unfastened, and bobbed idiotically with each movement.  The rifles, once loaded, were jerked to the shoulder and fired without  apparent aim into the smoke or at one of the blurred and shifting forms  which upon the field before the regiment had been growing larger and  larger like puppets under a magician's hand.    The officers, at their intervals, rearward, neglected to stand in  picturesque attitudes.  They were bobbing to and fro roaring directions  and encouragements.  The dimensions of their howls were extraordinary.  They expended their lungs with prodigal wills.  And often they nearly  stood upon their heads in their anxiety to observe the enemy on the  other side of the tumbling smoke.    The lieutenant of the youth's company had encountered a soldier who had  fled screaming at the first volley of his comrades.  Behind the lines  these two were acting a little isolated scene.  The man was blubbering  and staring with sheeplike eyes at the lieutenant, who had seized him  by the collar and was pommeling him.  He drove him back into the ranks  with many blows.  The soldier went mechanically, dully, with his  animal-like eyes upon the officer.  Perhaps there was to him a divinity  expressed in the voice of the other--stern, hard, with no reflection of  fear in it.  He tried to reload his gun, but his shaking hands  prevented.  The lieutenant was obliged to assist him.    The men dropped here and there"]]]
