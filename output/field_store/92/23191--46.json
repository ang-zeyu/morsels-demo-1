'Not much,' said the Babe, with a shudder.    'Well, even barring present company, there are lots of chaps who would  have jumped at the chance of being head of a House. But nothing would  satisfy Ward but lugging the Mutual from the bosom of his beastly  family.'    'We haven't decided that point about where he goes to,' said the Babe.    At this moment the door of the study opened, and the gentleman in  question appeared in person. He stood in the doorway for a few seconds,  gasping and throwing his arms about as if he found a difficulty in  making his way in.    'I wish you two wouldn't make such an awful froust in the study  _every_ afternoon,' he observed, pleasantly. 'Have you been having  a little tea-party? How nice!'    'We've been brewing, if that's what you mean,' said Vaughan, shortly.    'Oh,' said Plunkett, 'I hope you enjoyed yourselves. It's nearly  lock-up, MacArthur.'    'That's Plunkett's delicate way of telling you you're not wanted,  Babe.'    'Well, I suppose I ought to be going,' said the Babe. 'So long.'    And he went, feeling grateful to Providence for not having made his  father, like the fathers of Vaughan and Dallas, a casual acquaintance  of Mr Ward.    The Mutual Friend really was a trial to Vaughan and Dallas. Only those  whose fate it is or has been to share a study with an uncongenial  companion can appreciate their feelings to the full. Three in a study  is always something of a tight fit, and when the three are in a state  of perpetual warfare, or, at the best, of armed truce, things become  very bad indeed.    'Do you find it necessary to have tea-parties every evening?' enquired  Plunkett, after he had collected his books for the night's work. 'The  smell of burnt meat--'    'Fried sausages,' said Vaughan. 'Perfectly healthy smell. Do you good.'    'It's quite disgusting. Really, the air in here is hardly fit to  breathe.'    'You'll find an excellent brand of air down in the senior study,' said  Dallas, pointedly. 'Don't stay and poison yourself here on _our_  account,' he added. 'Think of your family.'    'I shall work where I choose,' said the Mutual Friend, with dignity.    'Of course, so long as you do work. You mustn't talk. Vaughan and I  have got some Livy to do.'    Plunkett snorted, and the passage of arms ended, as it usually did, in  his retiring with his books to the senior study, leaving Dallas and  Vaughan to discuss his character once more in case there might be any  points of it left upon which they had not touched in previous  conversations.    'This robbery of the pots is a rum thing,' said Vaughan, thoughtfully,  when the last shreds of Plunkett's character had been put through the  mincing-machine to the satisfaction of all concerned.    'Yes. It's the sort of thing one doesn't think possible till it  actually happens.'    'What the dickens made them put the things in the Pav. at all? They  must have known it wouldn't be safe.'    'Well, you see, they usually cart them into the Board Room, I believe,  only this time the governors were going to have a meeting there. They  couldn't very well meet in a room with the table all covered with  silver pots.'    'Don't see why.'    'Well, I suppose they could, really, but some of the governors are  fairly nuts on strict form. There's that crock who makes the two-hour  vote of thanks speeches on Prize Day. You can see him rising to a point  of order, and fixing the Old 'Un with a fishy eye.'    'Well, anyhow, I don't see that they can blame a burglar for taking the  pots if they simply chuck them in his way like that.'    'No. I say, we'd better weigh in with the Livy. The man Ward'll be  round directly. Where's the dic? _And_ our invaluable friend, Mr  Bohn? Right. Now, you reel it off, and I'll keep an eye on the notes.'  And they settled down to the business of the day.    After a while Vaughan looked up.    'Who's going to win the mile?' he asked.    'What's the matter with Thomson?'    'How about Drake then?'    'Thomson won the half.'    'I knew you'd say that. The half isn't a test of a chap's mile form.  Besides, did you happen to see Drake's sprint?'    'Jolly good one.'    'I know, but look how late he started for it. Thomson crammed on the  pace directly he got into the straight. Drake only began to put it on  when he got to the Pav. Even then he wasn't far behind at the tape.'    'No. Well, I'm not plunging either way. Ought to be a good race.'    'Rather. I say, I wonder Welch doesn't try his hand at the mile. I  believe he would do some rattling times if he'd only try.'    'Why, Welch is a sprinter.'    'I know. But I believe for all that that the mile's his distance. He's  always well up in the cross-country runs.'    'Anyhow, he's not in for it this year. Thomson's my man. It'll be a  near thing, though.'    'Jolly near thing. With Drake in front.'    'Thomson.'    'Drake.'    'All right, we'll see. Wonder why the beak doesn't come up. I can't sit  here doing Livy all the evening. And yet if we stop he's bound to look  in.'    'Oh Lord, is that what you've been worrying about? I thought you'd  developed the work habit or something. Ward's all right. He's out on  the tiles tonight. Gone to a dinner at Philpott's.'    'Good man, how do you know? Are you certain?'    'Heard him telling Prater this morning. Half the staff have gone. Good  opportunity for a chap to go for a stroll if he wanted to. Shall we, by  the way?'    'Not for me, thanks. I'm in the middle of a rather special book. Ever  read _Great Expectations_? Dickens, you know.'    'I know. Haven't read it, though. Always rather funk starting on a  classic, somehow. Good?'    'My dear chap! Good's not the word.'    'Well, after you. Exit Livy, then. And a good job, too. You might pass  us the great Sherlock. Thanks.'    He plunged with the great detective into the mystery of the speckled  band, while Vaughan opened _Great Expectations_ at the place where  he had left off the night before. And a silence fell upon the study.    Curiously enough, Dallas was not the only member of Ward's House to  whom it occurred that evening that the absence of the House-master  supplied a good opportunity for a stroll. The idea had also struck  Plunkett favourably. He was not feeling very comfortable down-stairs.  On entering the senior study he found Galloway, an Upper Fourth member  of the House, already in possession. Galloway had managed that evening  to insinuate himself with such success into the good graces of the  matron, that he had been allowed to stay in the House instead of  proceeding with the rest of the study to the Great Hall for  preparation. The palpable failure of his attempt to hide the book he  was reading under the table when he was disturbed led him to cast at  the Mutual Friend, the cause of his panic, so severe and forbidding a  look, that that gentleman retired, and made for the junior study.    The atmosphere in the junior study was close, and heavy with a blend of  several strange odours. Plunkett went to the window. Then he noticed  what he had never noticed before, that there were no bars to the  window. Only the glass stood between him and the outer world. He threw  up the sash as far as it would go. There was plenty of room to get out.  So he got out. He stood for a moment inhaling the fresh air. Then,  taking something from his coat-pocket, he dived into the shadows. An  hour passed. In the study above, Dallas, surfeited with mysteries and  villainy, put down his book and stretched himself.    'I say, Vaughan,' he said. 'Have you settled the House gym. team yet?  It's about time the list went up.'    'Eh? What?' said Vaughan, coming slowly out of his book.    Dallas repeated his question.    'Yes,' said Vaughan, 'got it somewhere on me. Haynes, Jarvis, and  myself are going in. Only, the Mutual has to stick up the list.'    It was the unwritten rule in Ward's, as in most of the other Houses at  the School, that none but the head of the House had the right of  placing notices on the House board.    'I know,' said Dallas. 'I'll go and buck him up now.'    'Don't trouble. After prayers'll do.'    'It's all right. No trouble. Whom did you say? Yourself, Haynes--'    'And Jarvis. Not that he's any good. But the third string never matters  much, and it'll do him good to represent the House.'    'Right. I'll go and unearth the Mutual.'    The result was that Galloway received another shock to his system.    'Don't glare, Galloway. It's rude,' said Dallas.    'Where's Plunkett got to?' he added.    'Junior study,' said Galloway.    Dallas went to the junior study. There were Plunkett's books on the  table, but of their owner no signs were to be seen. The Mutual Friend  had had the good sense to close the window after he had climbed through  it, and Dallas did not suspect what had actually happened. He returned  to Vaughan.    'The Mutual isn't in either of the studies,' he said. 'I didn't want to  spend the evening playing hide-and-seek with him, so I've come back.'    'It doesn't matter, thanks all the same. Later on'll do just as well.'    'Do you object to the window going up?' asked Dallas. 'There's a bit of  a froust on in here.'    'Rather not. Heave it up.'    Dallas hove it. He stood leaning out, looking towards the College  buildings, which stood out black and clear against the April sky. From  out of the darkness in the direction of Stapleton sounded the  monotonous note of a corn-crake.    'Jove,' he said, 'it's a grand night. If I was at home now I shouldn't  be cooped up indoors like this.'    'Holidays in another week,' said Vaughan, joining him. 'It is ripping,  isn't it? There's something not half bad in the Coll. buildings on a  night like this. I shall be jolly sorry to leave, in spite of Ward and  the Mutual.'    'Same here, by Jove.

He  applied. Farnie with the utmost willingness brought to light a handful  of money, mostly gold. Monk's eye gleamed approval, and he stretched  forth an itching palm. Danvers began to think that it would be rash to  let a chance like this slip. Ordinarily the tacit agreement between the  pair was that only one should borrow at a time, lest confidence should  be destroyed in the victim. But here was surely an exception, a special  case. With a young gentleman so obviously a man of coin as Farnie, the  rule might well be broken for once.    'While you're about it, Farnie, old man,' he said carelessly, 'you might  let me have a bob or two if you don't mind. Five bob'll see me through  to Saturday all right.'    'Do you mean tomorrow?' enquired Farnie, looking up from his heap of  gold.    'No, Saturday week. Let you have it back by then at the latest. Make a  point of it.'    'How would a quid do?'    'Ripping,' said Danvers ecstatically.    'Same here,' assented Monk.    'Then that's all right,' said Farnie briskly; 'I thought perhaps you  mightn't have had enough. You've got a quid, I know, Monk, because I  saw you haul one out at breakfast. And Danvers has got one too, because  he offered to toss you for it in the study afterwards. And besides, I  couldn't lend you anything in any case, because I've only got about  fourteen quid myself.'    With which parting shot he retired, wrapped in gentle thought, into his  form-room; and from the noise which ensued immediately upon his  arrival, the shrewd listener would have deduced, quite correctly, that  he had organized and taken the leading part in a general rag.    Monk and Danvers proceeded upon their way.    'You got rather left there, old chap,' said Monk at length.    'I like that,' replied the outraged Danvers. 'How about you, then? It  seemed to me you got rather left, too.'    Monk compromised.    'Well, anyhow,' he said, 'we shan't get much out of that kid.'    'Little beast,' said Danvers complainingly. And they went on into their  form-room in silence.    'I saw your young--er--relative in earnest conversation with friend  Monk this morning,' said Marriott, later on in the day, to Gethryn; 'I  thought you were going to give him the tip in that direction?'    'So I did,' said the Bishop wearily; 'but I can't always be looking  after the little brute. He only does it out of sheer cussedness,  because I've told him not to. It stands to reason that he can't  _like_ Monk.'    'You remind me of the psalmist and the wicked man, surname unknown,'  said Marriott. 'You _can't_ see the good side of Monk.'    'There isn't one.'    'No. He's only got two sides, a bad side and a worse side, which he  sticks on on the strength of being fairly good at games. I wonder if  he's going to get his First this season. He's not a bad bat.'    'I don't think he will. He is a good bat, but there are heaps better in  the place. I say, I think I shall give young Farnie the tip once more,  and let him take it or leave it. What do you think?'    'He'll leave it,' said Marriott, with conviction.    Nor was he mistaken. Farnie listened with enthusiasm to his nephew's  second excursus on the Monk topic, and, though he said nothing, was  apparently convinced. On the following afternoon Monk, Danvers,  Waterford, and he hired a boat and went up the river together. Gethryn  and Marriott, steered by Wilson, who was rapidly developing into a  useful coxswain, got an excellent view of them moored under the shade  of a willow, drinking ginger-beer, and apparently on the best of terms  with one another and the world in general. In a brief but moving speech  the Bishop finally excommunicated his erring relative. 'For all I  care,' he concluded, 'he can do what he likes in future. I shan't stop  him.'    'No,' said Marriott, 'I don't think you will.'    For the first month of his school life Farnie behaved, except in his  choice of companions, much like an ordinary junior. He played cricket  moderately well, did his share of compulsory fielding at the First  Eleven net, and went for frequent river excursions with Monk, Danvers,  and the rest of the Mob.    At first the other juniors of the House were inclined to resent this  extending of the right hand of fellowship to owners of studies and  Second Eleven men, and attempted to make Farnie see the sin and folly  of his ways. But Nature had endowed that youth with a fund of vitriolic  repartee. When Millett, one of Leicester's juniors, evolved some  laborious sarcasm on the subject of Farnie's swell friends, Farnie, in  a series of three remarks, reduced him, figuratively speaking, to a  small and palpitating spot of grease. After that his actions came in  for no further, or at any rate no outspoken comment.    Given sixpence a week and no more, Farnie might have survived an entire  term without breaking any serious School rule. But when, after buying a  bicycle from Smith of Markham's, he found himself with eight pounds to  his name in solid cash, and the means of getting far enough away from  the neighbourhood of the School to be able to spend it much as he  liked, he began to do strange and risky things in his spare time.    The great obstacle to illicit enjoyment at Beckford was the four  o'clock roll-call on half-holidays. There were other obstacles, such as  half-holiday games and so forth, but these could be avoided by the  exercise of a little judgement. The penalty for non-appearance at a  half-holiday game was a fine of sixpence. Constant absence was likely  in time to lead to a more or less thrilling interview with the captain  of cricket, but a very occasional attendance was enough to stave off  this disaster; and as for the sixpence, to a man of means like Farnie  it was a mere nothing. It was a bad system, and it was a wonder, under  the circumstances, how Beckford produced the elevens it did. But it was  the system, and Farnie availed himself of it to the full.    The obstacle of roll-call he managed also to surmount. Some reckless  and penniless friend was generally willing, for a consideration, to  answer his name for him. And so most Saturday afternoons would find  Farnie leaving behind him the flannelled fools at their various  wickets, and speeding out into the country on his bicycle in the  direction of the village of Biddlehampton, where mine host of the 'Cow  and Cornflower', in addition to other refreshment for man and beast,  advertised that ping-pong and billiards might be played on the  premises. It was not the former of these games that attracted Farnie.  He was no pinger. Nor was he a pongster. But for billiards he had a  decided taste, a genuine taste, not the pumped-up affectation sometimes  displayed by boys of his age. Considering his age he was a remarkable  player. Later on in life it appeared likely that he would have the  choice of three professions open to him, namely, professional billiard  player, billiard marker, and billiard sharp. At each of the three he  showed distinct promise. He was not 'lured to the green cloth' by Monk  or Danvers. Indeed, if there had been any luring to be done, it is  probable that he would have done it, and not they. Neither Monk nor  Danvers was in his confidence in the matter. Billiards is not a cheap  amusement. By the end of his sixth week Farnie was reduced to a single  pound, a sum which, for one of his tastes, was practically poverty. And  just at the moment when he was least able to bear up against it, Fate  dealt him one of its nastiest blows. He was playing a fifty up against  a friendly but unskilful farmer at the 'Cow and Cornflower'. 'Better  look out,' he said, as his opponent effected a somewhat rustic stroke,  'you'll be cutting the cloth in a second.' The farmer grunted, missed  by inches, and retired, leaving the red ball in the jaws of the pocket,  and Farnie with three to make to win.    It was an absurdly easy stroke, and the Bishop's uncle took it with an  absurd amount of conceit and carelessness. Hardly troubling to aim, he  struck his ball. The cue slid off in one direction, the ball rolled  sluggishly in another. And when the cue had finished its run, the  smooth green surface of the table was marred by a jagged and unsightly  cut. There was another young man gone wrong!    To say that the farmer laughed would be to express the matter feebly.  That his young opponent, who had been irritating him unspeakably since  the beginning of the game with advice and criticism, should have done  exactly what he had cautioned him, the farmer, against a moment before,  struck him as being the finest example of poetic justice he had ever  heard of, and he signalized his appreciation of the same by nearly  dying of apoplexy.    The marker expressed an opinion that Farnie had been and gone and done  it.    ''Ere,' he said, inserting a finger in the cut to display its  dimensions. 'Look 'ere. This'll mean a noo cloth, young feller me lad.  That's wot this'll mean. That'll be three pound we will trouble you  for, if _you_ please.'    Farnie produced his sole remaining sovereign.    'All I've got,' he said. 'I'll leave my name and address.'    'Don't you trouble, young feller me lad,' said the marker, who appeared  to be a very aggressive and unpleasant sort of character altogether,  with meaning, 'I know yer name and I knows yer address. Today fortnight  at the very latest, if _you_ please. You don't want me to 'ave to  go to your master about it, now, do yer? What say? No. Ve' well then.  Today fortnight is the time, and you remember it.'    What was left of Farnie then rode slowly back to Beckford. Why he went  to Monk on his return probably he could not have explained himself. But  he did go, and, having told his story in full, wound up by asking for a  loan of two pounds. Monk's first impulse was to refer him back to "]]]
