In the meanwhile the unfortunate packhorses wandered away,  loaded as they were, and died in thirst and agony, weighed down by  their unremoved packs, none of which were ever recovered. Thus all the  food supply and nearly all the carrying power of the expedition was  lost; the only wonder was that none of these wretches actually died at  the spot, although I heard some of them died soon after. The return of  McIntyre and the camels loaded with water saved their lives at the  time; but what was his chagrin and surprise to find the party just  where he had left them, nearly dead, most of them delirious, with all  the horses gone, when he had expected to meet them so much nearer the  Paroo. In consequence of the state these men or animals were in, they  had to be carried on the camels, and it was impossible to go in search  of the horses; thus all was lost. This event crushed the expedition.  Mcintyre obtained a few more horses, pushed across to the Flinders  again, became attacked with fever, and died. Thus the \"Ladies'  Leichhardt Search Expedition\" entirely fell through. The camels were  subsequently claimed by McIntyre's brother for the cost of grazing  them, he having been carried by them to Carpentaria, where he selected  an excellent pastoral property, became rich, and died. It was the same  doctor that got into trouble with the Queensland Government concerning  the kidnapping of some islanders in the South Seas, and narrowly  escaped severe, if not capital punishment.    In 1866, Mr. Cowle conducted an expedition from Roebourne, near Nicol  Bay, on the West Coast, for four or five hundred miles to the Fitzroy  River, discovered by Wickham, at the bottom of King's Sound.    In 1869, a report having spread in Western Australia of the massacre  of some white people by the natives somewhere to the eastwards of  Champion Bay, on the west coast, the rumour was supposed to relate to  Leichhardt and his party; and upon the representations of Baron von  Mueller to the West Australian Government, a young surveyor named John  Forrest was despatched to investigate the truth of the story. This  expedition penetrated some distance to the eastwards, but could  discover no traces of the lost, or indeed anything appertaining to any  travellers whatever.    In 1869-70, John Forrest, accompanied by his brother Alexander, was  again equipped by the West Australian Government for an exploration  eastwards, with the object of endeavouring to reach the South  Australian settlements by a new route inland. Forrest, however,  followed Eyre's track of 1840-1, along the shores of the Great  Australian Bight, and may be said to have made no exploration at all,  as he did not on any occasion penetrate inland more than about thirty  miles from the coast. At an old encampment Forrest found the skull of  one of Eyre's horses, which had been lying there for thirty years.  This trophy he brought with him to Adelaide.    The following year, Alexander Forrest conducted an expedition to the  eastwards, from the West Australian settlements; but only succeeded in  pushing a few miles beyond Hunt and Lefroy's furthest point in 1864.    What I have written above is an outline of the history of discovery  and exploration in Australia when I first took the field in the year  1872; and though it may not perhaps be called, as Tennyson says, one  of the fairy tales of science, still it is certainly one of the long  results of time. I have conducted five public expeditions and several  private ones. The latter will not be recorded in these volumes, not  because there were no incidents of interest, but because they were  conducted, in connection with other persons, for entirely pastoral  objects. Experiences of hunger, thirst, and attacks by hostile natives  during those undertakings relieved them of any monotony they might  otherwise display. It is, however, to my public expeditions that I  shall now confine my narrative.    The wild charm and exciting desire that induce an individual to  undertake the arduous tasks that lie before an explorer, and the  pleasure and delight of visiting new and totally unknown places, are  only whetted by his first attempt, especially when he is constrained  to admit that his first attempt had not resulted in his carrying out  its objects.    My first and second expeditions were conducted entirely with horses;  in all my after journeys I had the services of camels, those wonderful  ships of the desert, without whose aid the travels and adventures  which are subsequently recorded could not possibly have been achieved,  nor should I now be alive, as Byron says, to write so poor a tale,  this lowly lay of mine. In my first and second expeditions, the object  I had in view was to push across the continent, from different  starting points, upon the South Australian Transcontinental Telegraph  Line, to the settled districts of Western Australia. My first  expedition was fitted out entirely by Baron von Mueller, my  brother-in-law, Mr. G.D. Gill, and myself. I was joined in this  enterprise by a young gentleman, named Samuel Carmichael, whom I met  in Melbourne, and who also contributed his share towards the  undertaking. The furthest point reached on this journey was about 300  miles from my starting point. On my return, upon reaching the  Charlotte Waters Telegraph Station, in latitude 25 degrees 55' and  longitude 135 degrees I met Colonel Warburton and his son, whom I had  known before. These gentlemen informed me, to my great astonishment,  they were about to undertake an exploring expedition to Western  Australia, for two well-known capitalists of South Australia, namely  the Honourable Sir Thomas Elder and Captain Hughes. I was also  informed that a South Australian Government expedition, for the same  purpose, was just in advance of them, under the command of Mr. William  C. Gosse. This information took me greatly by surprise, though perhaps  an explorer should not admit such a feeling. I had just returned from  an attempt of the same kind, beaten and disappointed. I felt if ever I  took the field again, against two such formidable rivals as were now  about to attempt what I had failed in, both being supplied with camels  by Sir Thomas Elder, my chances of competing with them would be small  indeed, as I could only command horses, and was not then known to Sir  Thomas Elder, the only gentleman in Australia who possessed camels.    The fact of two expeditions starting away simultaneously, almost as  soon as I had turned my back upon civilisation, showed me at once that  my attempt, I being regarded as a Victorian, had roused the people and  Government of South Australia to the importance of the question which  I was the first to endeavour to solve--namely, the exploration of the  unknown interior, and the possibility of discovering an overland route  for stock through Central Australia, to the settlements upon the  western coast. This, I may remark, had been the dream of all  Australian explorers from the time of Eyre and Leichhardt down to my  own time. It also showed that South Australia had no desire to be  beaten again (Burke and Stuart.), and in her own territories, by  \"worthless Melbourne's pulling child;\" (hence the two new expeditions  arose). Immediately upon my return being made known by telegram to my  friend Baron von Mueller, he set to work, and with unwearied exertion  soon obtained a new fund from several wealthy gentlemen in the rival  colony of Victoria. In consideration of the information I had afforded  by my late effort, the Government of South Australia supplemented this  fund by the munificent subsidy of 250 pounds, provided I EXPENDED the  money in fresh explorations, and supplied to the Government, at the  termination of my journey, a copy of the map and journal of my  expedition. My poverty, and not my will, consented to accept so mean a  gift. As a new, though limited fund was now placed at my disposal, I  had no inclination to decline a fresh attempt, and thus my second  expedition was undertaken; and such despatch was used by Baron Mueller  and myself, that I was again in the field, with horses only, not many  weeks later than my rivals.    On this journey I was accompanied and seconded by Mr. William Henry  Tietkens. We had both been scholars at Christ's Hospital in London,  though many years apart. Of the toils and adventures of my second  expedition the readers of my book must form their own opinion; and  although I was again unsuccessful in carrying out my object, and the  expedition ended in the death of one member, and in misfortune and  starvation to the others, still I have been told by a few partial  friends that it was really a splendid failure. On that expedition I  explored a line of nearly 700 miles of previously unknown country, in  a straight line from my starting point.    During my first and second expeditions I had been fortunate in the  discovery of large areas of mountain country, permanently watered and  beautifully grassed, and, as spaces of enormous extent still remained  to be explored, I decided to continue in the field, provided I could  secure the use of camels. These volumes will contain the narratives of  my public explorations. In the preface to this work I have given an  outline of the physical and colonial divisions of Australia, so that  my reader may eventually follow me, albeit in imagination only, to the  starting points of my journeys, and into the field of my labours also.      PREFACE.    The Island Continent of Australia contains an area of about three  millions of square miles, it being, so to say, an elliptically-shaped  mass about 2500 miles in length from east to west, and 2000 from north  to south. The degrees of latitude and longitude it occupies will be  shown by the map accompanying these volumes.

When a man dies his first finger is cut off, because he must not  fight in the next world, nor need he throw a spear to slay animals, as  game is supplied. The body is then bent double until the knees touch the  chin--this to represent a baby before birth; and in this cramped position  the late warrior is crammed into his grave, until, according to a  semi-civilised boy that I knew, he is called to the happy hunting grounds,  where he changes colour! \"Black fella tumble down, jump up white fella.\"  A clear proof that this benighted people have some conception of a better  state hereafter.    Once through the scrub, we came again into gum-timbered country, and when  fifty miles east of Kurnalpi crossed a narrow belt of auriferous country,  but, failing to find water, were unable to stop. In a few miles we were in  desert country--undulations of sand and spinifex, with frequent clumps of  dense mallee, a species of eucalyptus, with several straggling stems  growing from one root, and little foliage except at the ends of the  branches, an untidy and melancholy-looking tree. There was no change in  the country till after noon on the 18th, when we noticed some grass-trees,  or black-boys, smaller than those seen near the coast, and presently  struck the outskirts of a little oasis, and immediately after an old camel  pad (Lindsay's in 1892, formed by a caravan of over fifty animals), which  we followed for a few minutes, until the welcome sight of Queen Victoria  Spring met our eyes. A most remarkable spot, and one that cannot be better  described than by quoting the words of its discoverer, Ernest Giles,  in 1875, who, with a party of five companions, fifteen pack, and seven  riding camels, happened on this spring just when they most needed water.    Giles says of it:--    \"It is the most singularly placed water I have ever seen, lying in a small  hollow in the centre of a little grassy flat and surrounded by clumps of  funereal pines. . . . The water is no doubt permanent, for it is supplied  by the drainage of the sandhills which surround it and it rests on a  substratum of impervious clay. It lies exposed to view in a small, open  basin, the water being about only one hundred and fifty yards in  circumference and from two to three feet deep. Further up the slopes at  much higher levels native wells had been sunk in all directions--in each  and all of these there was water. Beyond the immediate precincts of this  open space the scrubs abound. . . . Before I leave this spot I had perhaps  better remark that it might prove a very difficult, perhaps dangerous,  place to any other traveller to attempt to find, because although there  are many white sandhills in the neighbourhood, the open space on which  the water lies is so small in area and so closely surrounded by scrubs,  that it cannot be seen from any conspicuous one, nor can any conspicuous  sandhill, distinguishable at any distance, be seen from it. On the top of  the banks above the wells was a beaten corroboree path, where the denizens  of the desert have often held their feasts and dances. Some grass-trees  grew in the vicinity of this spring to a height of over twenty  feet. . . .\"    A charming spot indeed! but we found it to be hardly so cheerful as this  description would lead one to expect. For at first sight the Spring was  dry. The pool of water was now a dry clay-pan; the numerous native wells  were there, but all were dry. The prospect was sufficiently gloomy, for  our water was all but done, and poor Tommy, the pony, in spite of an  allowance of a billy-full per night, was in a very bad way, for we had  travelled nearly one hundred miles from the last water, and if this was  dry we knew no other that we could reach. However, we were not going to  cry before we were hurt and set to work to dig out the soak, and in a  short time were rewarded by the sight of water trickling in on all sides,  and, by roughly timbering the sides, soon had a most serviceable well--a  state of affairs greatly appreciated by Tommy and the camels. This spring  or soakage, whichever it may be, is in black sand, though the sand outside  the little basin is yellowish white. From what I have heard and read of  them it must be something of the nature of what are called \"black soil  springs.\" Giles was right in his description of its remarkable  surroundings--unless we had marched right into the oasis, we should  perhaps have missed it altogether, for it was unlikely that Lindsay's  camel tracks would be visible except where sheltered from the wind by the  trees; and our only instruments for navigation were a prismatic and pocket  compass, and a watch for rating our travel. I was greatly pleased at such  successful steering for a first attempt of any distance, and Luck was as  pleased as I was, for to him I owed many useful hints. Yet I was not blind  to the fact that it was a wonderful piece of luck to strike exactly a  small spot of no more than fifty acres in extent, hidden in the valleys of  the sandhills, from whose summits nothing could be seen but similar mounds  of white sand. Amongst the white gum trees we found one marked with  Lindsay's initials with date. Under this I nailed on a piece of tin, on  which I had stamped our names and date. Probably the blacks have long  since taken this down and used it as an ornament. Another tree, a pine,  was marked W. Blake; who he was I do not know, unless one of Lindsay's  party. Not far off was a grave, more like that of a white man than of a  native; about its history, too, I am ignorant.    Numerous old native camps surrounded the water, and many weapons, spears,  waddies, and coolimans were lying about. The camps had not been occupied  for some long time. In the scrub we came on a cleared space, some eighty  yards long and ten to twelve feet wide. At each end were heaps of ashes,  and down the middle ran a well-beaten path, and a similar one on either  side not unlike an old dray track. Evidently a corroboree ground of some  kind. From Luck I learnt that north of Eucla, where he had been with a  survey party, the natives used such grounds in their initiation  ceremonies. A youth on arriving at a certain age may become a warrior,  and is then allowed to carry a shield and spear. Before he can attain this  honour he must submit to some very horrible rites--which are best left  undescribed. Seizing each an arm of the victim, two stalwart \"bucks\"  (as the men are called) run him up and down the cleared space until they  are out of breath; then two more take places, and up and down they go  until at last the boy is exhausted. This is the aboriginal method of  applying anaesthetics. During the operations that follow, the men dance  and yell round the fires but the women may not be witnesses of the  ceremony. Tribes from all neighbouring districts meet at such times and  hold high revel. Evidently Queen Victoria Spring is a favourite  meeting-place. I regret that I never had the chance of being present at  such a gathering--few white men have. For except in thickly populated  districts the ceremonies are rare; the natives are very ready to resent  any prying into their mysteries, and Luck only managed it at some risk to  himself. Whilst camped at the Spring we made one or two short excursions  to the southward, but met with little encouragement. On turning our  attention to the opposite direction we found that nearly two hundred miles  due north a tract of auriferous country was marked on the map of the Elder  Expedition. Between us and that point, the country was unmapped and  untrodden except by black-fellows, and it seemed reasonable to suppose  that since the belts of country run more or less north and south we had  a fair chance of finding gold-bearing country extending southward. We  should be getting a long way from Coolgardie, but if a rich company could  not afford to open up the country, who could? To the east we knew that  desert existed, to the south the country was known, and to return the way  we had come would be only a waste of time. So we decided on the northern  course, and chose Mount Shenton, near which a soakage was marked, as our  objective point. We were not well equipped for a long march in new  country, since we had few camels and scanty facilities for carrying water.  By setting to work with the needle we soon had two canvas water-bags made;  Luck, who had served in the French navy, like all sailors, was a very  handy man in a camp, and could of course sew well, and gave me useful  lessons in the handling of a sail-needle.          CHAPTER II        IN UNKNOWN COUNTRY      On April 22nd we left the spring, steering due north--carrying in all  thirty-five gallons of water, though this supply was very perceptibly  reduced by evening, owing to the canvas being new; loss by evaporation was  lessened by covering the bags with a fly (a sheet of coarse calico). The  class of country we encountered the first and second day can stand for the  rest of the march. Spinifex plains, undulating sand-plains, rolling  sandhills, steep sand-ridges, mallee scrubs, desert-gum forests, and dense  thickets of mulga. The last were most unpleasant to travel through; for  as we wound our way, one walking ahead to break down the branches, the  other leading the camels, and Tommy following behind, every now and again  the water-camel banged his precious load against a tree; and we walked  with the constant risk of a dead branch ripping the canvas and letting  out the water.    On the second evening, in passing through a mallee scrub, we came on a  small tract of \"kopi country\" (powdered gypsum). Here were numerous old  native tracks, and we could see where the mallee roots had been dragged  up, broken into short pieces, presumably sucked or allowed to drain into  some vessel, and stacked"]]]
