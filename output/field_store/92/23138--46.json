[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#7)"],[1,"was Dick's birthday yesterday, and we boys  thought we would celebrate a bit.  So we had a little blow-out in  our room.\"    \"Was that the noise I heard last night?\"    \"The noise you heard was from our room, yes.  But that isn't what  I was getting at,\" stammered Sam.  \"We set a guard out in the  hallway to keep watch.\"    \"Well?\"    \"I was out in the hall part of the time, and I saw a dark figure  in the rear hallway prowling around in a most suspicious manner.  It went into Dormitory No. 3 and then came out and disappeared  toward the back stairs.\"    \"This is interesting.  Who was the party?\"    \"I couldn't make out.\"    \"Was it a man or a woman?    \"A man, sir, or else a big boy.  He had something like a shawl  over his shoulders and was dressed in black or dark-brown.\"    \"You saw him go in and come out of one of the sleeping rooms?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And then he went down the back stairs?\"    \"He either went down the stairs or else into one of the back  rooms.  I walked back after a minute or two, but I didn't see  anything more of him, although I heard a door close and heard a  key turn in a lock.\"    \"Was this before I came up or after?\"    \"Before, sir. We went to sleep right after you came up.\"    \"Who was present at the feast?\" And now Captain Putnam prepared to  write down the names.    \"Oh, sir; I hope you won't--won't--\"    \"I'll have to ask you for the names, Samuel.  I want to know who  was on foot last night as well as who was robbed.\"    \"Surely you don't think any of us was guilty?\" cried Sam in sudden  horror.    \"I don't know what to think.  The names, please.\"    \"I--I think I'll have to refuse to give them, Captain Putnam.\"    \"Of course all the boys who sleep in your dormitory were present?\"    \"I said I would take this all on my own shoulders, Captain Putnam.  Of course, you know I wouldn't have confessed at all; but I don't  wish to give that thief any advantage.\"    \"Perhaps the person wasn't a thief at all, only some other cadet  spying upon you.\"    \"We thought of that.\"    \"You may as well give me the names.  I shall find them out  anyway.\"    Hardly knowing whether or not he was doing right, Sam mentioned  all of the cadets who had taken part in the feast.  This list  Captain Putnam compared with another containing the names of those  who had been robbed.    \"Thirty-two pupils,\" he mused. \"I'll have the whole, school in  this before I finish.\"    He looked at Sam curiously.  The youth wondered what was coming  next, when there was a sudden knock on the door.  \"Come in,\" said  Captain Putnam, and one of the little boys entered with a letter  in his hand.    \"Mr. Strong sent me with this,\" said the young cadet.  \"He just  found it on the desk in the main recitation room.\"    \"All right, Powers; thank you,\" answered the captain, and took the  letter.  \"You can go,\" and Powers retired again.    The letter was encased in a dirty, envelope on which was printed  in a big hand, in lead pencil:    \"CAPT. VICTOR PUTNAM.  Very Important. Deliver at Once.\"    Taking up a steel blade, the master of the Hall cut open the  envelope and took out the slip of paper it contained.  As he read  the communication he started.  Then he crushed the paper in his  hand and looked sharply at Sam.    \"Samuel, was the party you saw in the hall-way tall and slim?\"    \"Rather tall, yes, sir.\"    \"And slim?\"    \"Well, he wasn't fat.\"    \"Did you see his face?\"    \"No; it was too dark for that, and, besides, he had that shawl, or  whatever it was, pretty well up around him.\"    \"Did you notice how he walked?\"    \"He moved on tiptoes.\"    \"And you cannot imagine who it was?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"By the way, you of course know Alexander Pop, our colored  waiter.\"    \"Why, to be sure!  Everybody knows Aleck, and we have had lots of  fun with him, at one time or another.  But you surely don't  suspect him, do you?\"    \"This letter says Pop is guilty.\"    \"That letter?  And who wrote it?\"    \"I do not know.  It contains but two lines, and you can read it  for yourself,\" and the captain handed over the communication,  which ran as follows:    \"Alexander Pop stole that money and the other things.  ONE WHO KNOWS ALL.\"    \"That's a mighty queer letter for anybody to write,\" murmured Sam,  as he handed it back.  \"Why didn't the writer come to you, as I  have done?\"    \"Perhaps he wanted to keep out of trouble.\"    \"I don't believe the letter tells the truth, sir.\"    \"And why not?\"    \"Because Aleck is too good-hearted a fellow to turn thief.\"    \"Hum!  That hardly covers the ground, Samuel.\"    \"Well, why don't you have him searched?\"    \"I will.\"    Without further ado Sam was dismissed, and Captain Putnam called  George Strong to him and showed the strange letter.    \"Why not look among Pop's effects?\" suggested the assistant.  \"He  may have hidden the money and jewelry in his trunk.\"    \"We will go up to his apartment,\" replied Captain Putnam, and a  few minutes later the pair ascended to the attic room which the  colored waiter had used for several terms.  They found Pop just  fixing up for a trip to Cedarville.    He nodded pleasantly, and then looked at both questioningly.    \"Pop, I am afraid I have a very unpleasant duty to perform,\" began  Captain Putnam.    \"Wot's dat, sah?\" asked Aleck in surprise.    \"You have heard of the robberies that have been committed?\"    \"'Deed I has, sah.  But--but yo' don't go fo' to distrust me, do  yo', cap'n?\" went on the colored man anxiously.    \"I would like to search your trunk and your clothing, Pop.  If you  are innocent you will not object.\"    \"But, sah, I didn't steal nuffin, sah.\"    \"Then you shouldn't object.\"    \"It aint right nohow to 'spect an honest colored pusson, sah,\"  said Aleck, growing angry.    \"Do you object to the search?\"    \"I do, sah.  I am not guilty, sah, an' dis am not treatin' me jest  right, sah, 'deed it aint, sah.\"    \"If you object, Pop, I will be under the painful necessity of  having Snuggers place you under arrest.  You know he is a special  officer for the Hall.\"    At this announcement Aleck fell back completely dumfounded.  \"Well, dat's de wust yet!\" he muttered, and sank back on a chair,  not knowing what to do next.          CHAPTER VIII    IN WHICH ALEXANDER POP RUNS AWAY      \"Will you submit to having your trunk examined or not?\" demanded  Captain Putnam, after a painful pause, during which Alexander  Pop's eyes rolled wildly from one teacher to the other.    \"Yo' kin examine it if yo' desire,\" said Aleck. \"But it's an  outrage, Cap'n Putnam, an' outrage, sah!\"    Without more ado Captain Putnam approached the waiter's trunk, to  find it locked.    \"Where is the key, Pop?\"    \"Dare, sah, on de nail alongside ob yo' sah.\"    Soon the trunk was unlocked and the lid thrown back.  The box  contained a miscellaneous collection of wearing apparel, which the  captain pushed to one side.  Then he brought out a cigar box  containing some cheap jewelry and other odds and ends, as well as  two five dollar bills.    \"Dat money am mine, sah,\" said Aleck. \"Yo paid me dat las'  Saturday, sall.\"    \"That is true, but how did this get here, Pop?\"    As Captain Putnam paused he held up a stud set with a ruby-the  very stud the cadet Weeks had lost!    \"Dat--dat stud--I never seen dat shirt-stud before, cap'n,  'deed I didn't,\" stammered the waiter.    \"That is certainly Weeks' stud; I remember it well,\" put in George  Strong.  \"He showed it to me one day, stating it was a gift from  his aunt.\"    \"And here is a cheap watch,\" added Captain Putnam, bringing forth  the article.  \"Pop, is this your watch?\"    \"No, sah--I--I never seen dat watch before,\" answered Aleck  nervously.  \"I dun reckon sumbuddy put up a job on dis poah coon,  sah,\" he continued ruefully.    \"I believe the job was put up by yourself,\" answered Captain  Putnam sternly.  \"If you are guilty you had better confess.\"    A stormy war of words followed.  Alexander Pop stoutly declared  himself innocent, but in the face of the proofs discovered the  master of the Hall would not listen to him.    \"Peleg Snuggers shall take you in charge and drive down to the  Cedarville lock-up,\" said the captain.    The news that some of the things had been found in Pop's trunk  spread with great rapidity.  Many were astonished to learn that he  was thought guilty, but a few declared that \"a coon wasn't to be  trusted anyway.\"    \"Niggers are all thieves,\" said Jim Caven, \"never yet saw an  honest one.\"    \"I don't believe you!\" burst out Tom.  \"Pop's a first-rate fellow,  and the captain has got to have more proof against him before I'll  believe him guilty.\"    \"Oh, he's a bad egg!\" growled the Irish boy.    \"You only say that because he called you down last week,\" put in  Frank.  He referred to a tilt between the new pupil and the  colored man.  Jim Caven had tried to be \"smart\" and had gotten the  worst of the encounter.    \"Yes, I think he's as honest as you are!\" burst out Tom, before he  had stopped to think twice.    \"What! do you call me a thief!\" roared Jim Caven, and leaped upon  Tom, with his face as white as the wall.  \"I'll make you smart for  that!\"    One blow landed on Tom's cheek and another was about to follow,  when Tom dodged and came up under Caven's left arm.  Then the two  boys faced each other angrily.    \"A fight!  Fight!\" cried a number of the cadets, and in a twinkle  a ring was formed around the two contestants.    \"I'm going to give you the worst thrashing you ever had,\" said  Caven, but in rather a nervous tone.    \"All right, Caven, go ahead and do it,\" cried Tom.  \"I will stand  up for Aleck Pop, and there you are!\"    Tom launched forth and caught Caven on the right cheek.  The Irish  lad also struck out, but the blow fell short.  Then the two boys  clinched.    \"Break away there!\" cried Frank. \"Break away!\"    \"I'll break his head!\" panted Caven.  \"How do you like that?\"  And  he held Tom with one hand and hit him in the neck with the other.    The blow was a telling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#7)"],[1,"'t Captain Putnam rather strict about letting you  boys out?\" questioned, Dora.    \"We don't know yet--we are newcomers.\"    \"Newcomers!\" cried Nellie.  \"Then you don't know that fellow who  was just here?\"    \"No.  Does he belong at Putnam Hall?\"    \"Yes.  I know nothing of him, however, further than that I have  seen him several times on the Hall road.\"    Dick gave a low whistle.    \"Perhaps we've put our foot in it,\" remarked Sam in a low tone to  him.    \"Never mind; we did what was right,\" answered Dick.  \"No fellow is  justified in acting as Dan Baxter did.\"    \"That's right.\"    \"Tell us something about Putnam Hall, won't you?\" said Fred  Garrison, after a pause.    At this the three girls laughed.    \"What should we know about that place?\" asked Dora.  \"We have  never been inside, excepting at one Christmas entertainment.\"    \"But you must see some of the fellows occasionally.\"    \"Not often,\" said Grace Laning.  \"Captain Putnam does not allow  his pupils to leave the grounds excepting on special occasions.  But papa caught three of the pupils in our strawberry patch once.\"    \"He did?  And what happened to the fellows?\" put in Tom with deep  interest.    \"Father made them pick twelve quarts of berries for him for  nothing, and didn't let them eat a single one.\"    \"Great Caesar! What a fine fellow your dad--I mean your father--must  be.\"    \"Of course he is fine.  The boys had no right to attempt stealing  the berries.  My father would have given them some for the  asking.\"    \"But they wouldn't have been half as sweet as if they were hooked  on the sly,\" said Tom wisely, and everybody laughed.    \"You boys ought to have fine times at Putnam Hall,\" went on Dora  to Dick.  \"I sometimes see the soldier boys marching; and once,  last summer, I visited their encampment.\"    \"We are looking forward to a good time,\"' was the answer.  \"And I  trust we see you again,\" went on Dick; and Dora blushed prettily.    The Golden Star was now approaching a little landing known as  Hopedale, and all left their chairs to see the village, and people  getting on and off.  It was an engaging scene, and the did not  return to the bow of the boat until ten minutes  later, after  taking a walk completely around the steamer's deck.    In the bow a surprise awaited them.  During their absence Dan  Baxter had appropriated four of their camp chairs and was  stretched out on them as if in sleep.    \"Oh, what a cheek!\" cried Tom.    \"Let us haul him off,\" suggested Sam.    \"All right, come ahead,\" put in Fred.    \"Oh, please don't have another row with him!\" cried Dora in alarm.  \"Let him keep the seats.  We can go somewhere else.\"    \"All right, let the pig sleep,\" said Dick.    He felt tolerably certain that Dan Baxter was awake and heard him,  but the bully made no sign.    The party walked away, and the bully sneered softly to himself.    \"They didn't dare to tackle me,\" was what he thought in his  conceit.  \"I'd like to meet 'em one by one alone. I'd show each a  trick or two.\"    At last Cedarville was reached and the little steamer tied up at  the dock, and the boys and girls went ashore.  Just before  leaving, Dick took a look at Dan Baxter and saw that he was now  sleeping in earnest.    \"I won't wake him,\" he thought.  \"If he is carried to the head of  the lake, it will only serve him right.\"    Once on the dock, he and Fred hurried off to see about the baggage,  and while they were gone a well-dressed and pleasant-looking farmer  came up and kissed each of the girls. It was Mr. Laning.    \"I hope you had a nice visit to Cousin May's,\" he said.  \"Come,  the carriage is waiting out in the street.\"    And he hurried the girls away before they had hardly time to say  good-by.    \"Nice girls,\" remarked Tom.    \"Yes, indeed,\" answered Sam.  \"Hope we see them again.\"    \"We won't have much of a chance if what they say about Putnam Hall  is true, Sam.  Evidently Captain Putnam believes in keeping his  pupils well in hand.\"    \"Well, Uncle Randolph believes we ought to be taken well in  hand.\"    Dick and Fred returned presently, bringing with them a tall, lean  man of apparently fifty.    \"Boys,\" cried Fred, \"let me introduce you to Mr. Peleg  Snugsomebody, general utility man at Putnam Hall.\"    \"Peleg Snuggers, please,\" said the man meekly.  \"Excuse me, but I  was sent to bring you to the Hall.\"    \"Do we walk?\" demanded Tom.    \"No, sir; the carryall is out on the street, and my boy Pete has  the wagon for your trunks.\"    \"The trunks are already in the wagon,\" said Dick.  \"Come ahead.\"    \"How many of you, please?\" went on Peleg Snuggers.    \"There is only one of me, thank you,\" answered Tom meekly.    \"Don't joke me so early in the term, please,\" said the utility man  pleadingly.  \"Goodness knows, I'll get more than my share between  now and Christmas.  I mean, how many it the party?\"    \"Five of us, Mr. Sluggrub.\"    \"Snuggers, please; Peleg Snuggers--an easy name to remember when  you get the swing of it, sir.\"    \"To be sure, Smullers.  Yes, there are exactly five of us,\" and  Tom winked at his companions.    \"That's all right; the captain said to bring five.  Where is the  other?\"    \"What other?\"    \"The other boy. I see only four of you.\"    \"You asked me how many there were in the party, Mr. Snugbug.\"    \"Yes, sir; and you said five.\"    \"Four of us, and only one of you.  Isn't that five--or do they  have a different kind of arithmetic at Putnam Hall from what I  have been studying?\"    \"Please don't joke, Master Rover, please don't. I was to bring five  boys.\" The utility man drew a slip of paper from his pocket. \"Four new  boys--Richard, Samuel, and Thomas Rover and--Frederick Garrison--and  Corporal Daniel Baxter.\"    \"Gracious, the bully is a corporal at the Hall!\" came from Sam in  so low a tone that Snuggers did not catch it.    \"The corporal isn't present,\" said Fred, gazing around absently.    \"So he isn't.  Must have missed the boat.  Come along, please,\"  and Peleg Snuggers led the way to where a large and extra-heavy  carryall stood.  A splendid team of iron-grays was attached to the  carriage; and Dick, who loved good horseflesh, could not help but  admire the animals.    \"Oh, they are fine, Master Richard,\" said Snuggers.  \"Nothing  finer on the lake shore.  Captain Putnam's one recreation is to  drive behind a fast team.\"    \"Is it?  I wish he would take me out with him some time.\"    \"Always drives alone.  Reckon it kind of quiets him, after a noisy  time with the boy.\"    \"I suppose.\"    They were soon on the way, which led out of Cedarville and over a  hill fronting the lake.    \"By the way, do you know where the farms belonging to Mr. Stanhope  and to Mr. Laning are located?\" asked Tom, when they were well out  of the village.    \"Mr. Stanhope, sir?  There isn't any Mr. Stanhope.  He died two  years ago.  That place you see away over yonder is Mrs. Stanhope's  farm.\"    \"She has a daughter Dora?\"    \"Yes,\" Peleg Snuggers paused for a moment.  \"They say the widder  thinks of marrying again.\"    \"Is that so!\" put in Dick, and then he wondered if Dora would be  pleased with  her stepfather.  \"So that is the place?\"    \"Yes, sir; two hundred and fifty acres, and the fittest dairy in  these parts.  If the widder marries again, her husband will fall  into a very good thing.  The dairy company at Ithaca once offered  fifty thousand dollars for the cattle and land.\"    \"Gracious!\" came from Tom.  \"We've been chumming with an heiress.  Are the Lanings rich, too?\"    \"Very well to do.  That is their place, that side road.  Here is  where we turn off to get to the Hall.  Captain Putnam had this  road made when the Hall was first built.\"    The road was one of cracked stone, as smooth as a huge iron roller  could make it.  They bowled along at a rapid rate, under the wide  spreading branches of two rows of stately maples.  They were close  to the lake, and occasional glimpses of water could be caught  through the tree branches.    \"It is certainly a splendid locality for a boarding academy,\" was  Dick's comment.  \"My, what pure air--enough to make a sick boy  strong!  Do you have much sickness at the Hall?\"    \"Very little, sir.  The captain does not let a cast of sickness  stand, but calls in Dr. Fremley at once.\"    \"That is where he is level-headed,\" said Fred.  \"My father said I  was to call for a doctor the minute I felt at all sick.\"    They were now approaching Putnam Hall, but there was still another  turn to make.  As they swept around this, they came upon a tramp,  half asleep under a tree.  The tramp roused up at the sounds of  carriage wheels and looked first at the driver of the carryall and  then at the four boys.    \"Phew!\" he ejaculated, and lost no time in diving out of sight  into some brush back of the row of maples.    \"Hullo, who was that?\" cried Sam.    \"A tramp, I reckon,\" answered the utility man.  \"We are bothered a  good deal with them.\"    \"Begging at the Hall for the left-overs?\"    \"Exactly.  The captain is too kind-hearted.  He ought to drive 'em  all away,\" answered Peleg Snuggers; and then the carryall passed  on.    When it was gone, and the wagon with the trunks had followed, the  tramp came out of the brush and gazed after both turnouts.  \"Say,  Buddy Girk, but dat was a narrow escape,\" he muttered to himself.  \"Wot brought dem young gents to dis neighborhood?  It can't be  possible da have tracked me--an' so quick.\"  He hesitated.  \"I  t'ink I had better give dis neighborhood de go-by,\" and he dove  into the brush again.  He was the rascal who had stolen Dick's  timepiece.          CHAPTER VII    TOM GETS INTO TROUBLE      Putnam Hall was a fine building of brick and stone, standing in  the center of a beautiful parade ground of nearly ten acres.  In  front of the parade ground was the wagon road, and beyond was a  gentle slope leading down to the lake.  To the left of the  building was a playground hedged in by cedars, at one corner of  which stood a two-story frame"]]]
