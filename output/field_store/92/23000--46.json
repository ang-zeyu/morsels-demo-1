An opposite  conclusion was reached by Laplace, who showed that the effect of this  force was neutralized by forces producing the wave and acting in the  opposite direction. And yet, nearly a century later, it was shown that  while Laplace was quite correct as regards the general principles  involved, the friction of the moving water must prevent the complete  neutralization of the two opposing forces, and leave a small residual  force acting towards the west and retarding the rotation. Kant's  conclusion was established, but by an action different from that which  he supposed.    The theory of Wright and Kant, which was still further developed by  Herschel, was that our stellar system has somewhat the form of a  flattened cylinder, or perhaps that which the earth would assume if, in  consequence of more rapid rotation, the bulging out at its equator and  the flattening at its poles were carried to an extreme limit. This form  has been correctly though satirically compared to that of a grindstone.  It rests to a certain extent, but not entirely, on the idea that the  stars are scattered through space with equal thickness in every  direction, and that the appearance of the Milky Way is due to the fact  that we, situated in the centre of this flattened system, see more  stars in the direction of the circumference of the system than in that  of its poles. The argument on which the view in question rests may be  made clear in the following way.    Let us chose for our observations that hour of the night at which the  Milky Way skirts our horizon. This is nearly the case in the evenings  of May and June, though the coincidence with the horizon can never be  exact except to observers stationed near the tropics. Using the figure  of the grindstone, we at its centre will then have its circumference  around our horizon, while the axis will be nearly vertical. The points  in which the latter intersects the celestial sphere are called the  galactic poles. There will be two of these poles, the one at the hour  in question near the zenith, the other in our nadir, and therefore  invisible to us, though seen by our antipodes. Our horizon corresponds,  as it were, to the central circle of the Milky Way, which now surrounds  us on all sides in a horizontal direction, while the galactic poles are  90 degrees distant from every part of it, as every point of the horizon  is 90 degrees from the zenith.    Let us next count the number of stars visible in a powerful telescope  in the region of the heavens around the galactic pole, now our zenith,  and find the average number per square degree. This will be the  richness of the region in stars. Then we take regions nearer the  horizontal Milky Way--say that contained between 10 degrees and 20  degrees from the zenith--and, by a similar count, find its richness in  stars. We do the same for other regions, nearer and nearer to the  horizon, till we reach the galaxy itself. The result of all the counts  will be that the richness of the sky in stars is least around the  galactic pole, and increases in every direction towards the Milky Way.    Without such counts of the stars we might imagine our stellar system to  be a globular collection of stars around which the object in question  passed as a girdle; and we might take a globe with a chain passing  around it as representative of the possible figure of the stellar  system. But the actual increase in star-thickness which we have pointed  out shows us that this view is incorrect. The nature and validity of  the conclusions to be drawn can be best appreciated by a statement of  some features of this tendency of the stars to crowd towards the  galactic circle.    Most remarkable is the fact that the tendency is seen even among the  brighter stars. Without either telescope or technical knowledge, the  careful observer of the stars will notice that the most brilliant  constellations show this tendency. The glorious Orion, Canis Major  containing the brightest star in the heavens, Cassiopeia, Perseus,  Cygnus, and Lyra with its bright-blue Vega, not to mention such  constellations as the Southern Cross, all lie in or near the Milky Way.  Schiaparelli has extended the investigation to all the stars visible to  the naked eye. He laid down on planispheres the number of such stars in  each region of the heavens of 5 degrees square. Each region was then  shaded with a tint that was darker as the region was richer in stars.  The very existence of the Milky Way was ignored in this work, though  his most darkly shaded regions lie along the course of this belt. By  drawing a band around the sky so as to follow or cover his darkest  regions, we shall rediscover the course of the Milky Way without any  reference to the actual object. It is hardly necessary to add that this  result would be reached with yet greater precision if we included the  telescopic stars to any degree of magnitude--plotting them on a chart  and shading the chart in the same way. What we learn from this is that  the stellar system is not an irregular chaos; and that notwithstanding  all its minor irregularities, it may be considered as built up with  special reference to the Milky Way as a foundation.    Another feature of the tendency in question is that it is more and more  marked as we include fainter stars in our count. The galactic region is  perhaps twice as rich in stars visible to the naked eye as the rest of  the heavens. In telescopic stars to the ninth magnitude it is three or  four times as rich. In the stars found on the photographs of the sky  made at the Harvard and other observatories, and in the stargauges of  the Herschels, it is from five to ten times as rich.    Another feature showing the unity of the system is the symmetry of the  heavens on the two sides of the galactic belt Let us return to our  supposition of such a position of the celestial sphere, with respect to  the horizon, that the latter coincides with the central line of this  belt, one galactic pole being near our zenith. The celestial hemisphere  which, being above our horizon, is visible to us, is the one to which  we have hitherto directed our attention in describing the distribution  of the stars. But below our horizon is another hemisphere, that of our  antipodes, which is the counterpart of ours. The stars which it  contains are in a different part of the universe from those which we  see, and, without unity of plan, would not be subject to the same law.  But the most accurate counts of stars that have been made fail to show  any difference in their general arrangement in the two hemispheres.  They are just as thick around the south galactic poles as around the  north one. They show the same tendency to crowd towards the Milky Way  in the hemisphere invisible to us as in the hemisphere which we see.  Slight differences and irregularities, are, indeed, found in the  enumeration, but they are no greater than must necessarily arise from  the difficulty of stopping our count at a perfectly fixed magnitude.  The aim of star-counts is not to estimate the total number of stars,  for this is beyond our power, but the number visible with a given  telescope. In such work different observers have explored different  parts of the sky, and in a count of the same region by two observers we  shall find that, although they attempt to stop at the same magnitude,  each will include a great number of stars which the other omits. There  is, therefore, room for considerable difference in the numbers of stars  recorded, without there being any actual inequality between the two  hemispheres.    A corresponding similarity is found in the physical constitution of the  stars as brought out by the spectroscope. The Milky Way is extremely  rich in bluish stars, which make up a considerable majority of the  cloudlike masses there seen. But when we recede from the galaxy on one  side, we find the blue stars becoming thinner, while those having a  yellow tinge become relatively more numerous. This difference of color  also is the same on the two sides of the galactic plane. Nor can any  systematic difference be detected between the proper motions of the  stars in these two hemispheres. If the largest known proper motion is  found in the one, the second largest is in the other. Counting all the  known stars that have proper motions exceeding a given limit, we find  about as many in one hemisphere as in the other. In this respect, also,  the universe appears to be alike through its whole extent. It is the  uniformity thus prevailing through the visible universe, as far as we  can see, in two opposite directions, which inspires us with confidence  in the possibility of ultimately reaching some well-founded conclusion  as to the extent and structure of the system.    All these facts concur in supporting the view of Wright, Kant, and  Herschel as to the form of the universe. The farther out the stars  extend in any direction, the more stars we may see in that direction.  In the direction of the axis of the cylinder, the distances of the  boundary are least, so that we see fewer stars. The farther we direct  our attention towards the equatorial regions of the system, the greater  the distance from us to the boundary, and hence the more stars we see.  The fact that the increase in the number of stars seen towards the  equatorial region of the system is greater, the smaller the stars, is  the natural consequence of the fact that distant stars come within our  view in greater numbers towards the equatorial than towards the polar  regions.    Objections have been raised to the Herschelian view on the ground that  it assumes an approximately uniform distribution of the stars in space.  It has been claimed that the fact of our seeing more stars in one  direction than in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#7)"],[1,"'National Name-Book,'  in which all the names of the people were written down, with an account  of their forefathers and of any notable things which they had done.    It is from this book and from the old sagas that we learn how the  Norsemen came to the coast of America. It seems that about 900 a  certain man called Gunnbjorn was driven westward in a great storm and  thrown on the rocky shore of an ice-bound country, where he spent the  winter. Gunnbjorn reached home safely, and never tried again to find  this new land; but, long after his death, the story that there was land  farther west still lingered among the settlers in Iceland and the  Orkneys, and in other homes of the Norsemen. Some time after  Gunnbjorn's voyage it happened that a very bold and determined man  called Eric the Red, who lived in the Orkneys, was made an outlaw for  having killed several men in a quarrel. Eric fled westward over the  seas about the year 980, and he came to a new country with great rocky  bays and fjords as in Norway. There were no trees, but the slopes of  the hillsides were bright with grass, so he called the country  Greenland, as it is called to this day. Eric and his men lived in  Greenland for three years, and the ruins of their rough stone houses  are still to be seen, hard by one of the little Danish settlements of  to-day. When Eric and his followers went back to Iceland they told of  what they had seen, and soon he led a new expedition to Greenland. The  adventurers went in twenty-five ships; more than half were lost on the  way, but eleven ships landed safely and founded a colony in Greenland.  Other settlers came, and this Greenland colony had at one time a  population of about two thousand people. Its inhabitants embraced  Christianity when their kinsfolk in other places did so, and the ruins  of their stone churches still exist. The settlers raised cattle and  sheep, and sent ox hides and seal skins and walrus ivory to Europe in  trade for supplies. But as there was no timber in Greenland they could  not build ships, and thus their communication with the outside world  was more or less precarious. In spite of this, the colony lasted for  about four hundred years. It seems to have come to an end at about the  beginning of the fifteenth century. The scanty records of its history  can be traced no later than the year 1409. What happened to terminate  its existence is not known. Some writers, misled by the name  'Greenland,' have thought that there must have been a change of climate  by which the country lost its original warmth and verdure and turned  into an arctic region. There is no ground for this belief. The name  'Greenland' did not imply a country of trees and luxuriant vegetation,  but only referred to the bright carpet of grass still seen in the short  Greenland summer in the warmer hollows of the hillsides. It may have  been that the settlement, never strong in numbers, was overwhelmed by  the Eskimos, who are known to have often attacked the colony: very  likely, too, it suffered from the great plague, the Black Death, that  swept over all Europe in the fourteenth century. Whatever the cause,  the colony came to an end, and centuries elapsed before Greenland was  again known to Europe.    This whole story of the Greenland settlement is historical fact which  cannot be doubted. Partly by accident and partly by design, the  Norsemen had been carried from Norway to the Orkneys and the Hebrides  and Iceland, and from there to Greenland. This having happened, it was  natural that their ships should go beyond Greenland itself. During the  four hundred years in which the Norse ships went from Europe to  Greenland, their navigators had neither chart nor compass, and they  sailed huge open boats, carrying only a great square sail. It is  evident that in stress of weather and in fog they must again and again  have been driven past the foot of Greenland, and must have landed  somewhere in what is now Labrador. It would be inconceivable that in  four centuries of voyages this never happened. In most cases, no doubt,  the storm-tossed and battered ships, like the fourteen vessels that  Eric lost, were never heard of again. But in other cases survivors must  have returned to Greenland or Iceland to tell of what they had seen.    This is exactly what happened to a bold sailor called Bjarne, the son  of Herjulf, a few years after the Greenland colony was founded. In 986  he put out from Iceland to join his father, who was in Greenland, the  purpose being that, after the good old Norse custom, they might drink  their Christmas ale together. Neither Bjarne nor his men had ever  sailed the Greenland sea before, but, like bold mariners, they relied  upon their seafaring instinct to guide them to its coast. As Bjarne's  ship was driven westward, great mists fell upon the face of the waters.  There was neither sun nor stars, but day after day only the thick wet  fog that clung to the cold surface of the heaving sea. To-day  travellers even on a palatial steamship, who spend a few hours  shuddering in the chill grey fog of the North Atlantic, chafing at  delay, may form some idea of voyages such as that of Bjarne Herjulf and  his men. These Vikings went on undaunted towards the west. At last,  after many days, they saw land, but when they drew near they saw that  it was not a rugged treeless region, such as they knew Greenland to be,  but a country covered with forests, a country of low coasts rising  inland to small hills, and with no mountains in sight. Accordingly,  Bjarne said that this was not Greenland, and he would not stop, but  turned the vessel to the north. After two days they sighted land again,  still on the left side, and again it was flat and thick with trees. The  sea had fallen calm, and Bjarne's men desired to land and see this new  country, and take wood and water into the ship. But Bjarne would not.  So they held on their course, and presently a wind from the south-west  carried them onward for three days and three nights. Then again they  saw land, but this time it was high and mountainous, with great shining  caps of snow. And again Bjarne said, 'This is not the land I seek.'  They did not go ashore, but sailing close to the coast they presently  found that the land was an island. When they stood out to sea again,  the south wind rose to a gale that swept them towards the north, with  sail reefed down and with their ship leaping through the foaming  surges. Three days and nights they ran before the gale. On the fourth  day land rose before them, and this time it was Greenland. There Bjarne  found his father, and there, when not at sea, he settled for the rest  of his days.    Such is the story of Bjarne Herjulf, as the Norsemen have it. To the  unprejudiced mind there is every reason to believe that his voyage had  carried him to America, to the coast of the Maritime Provinces, or of  Newfoundland or Labrador. More than this one cannot say. True, it is  hard to fit the 'two days' and the 'three days' of Bjarne's narrative  into the sailing distances. But every one who has read any primitive  literature, or even the Homeric poems, will remember how easily times  and distances and numbers that are not exactly known are expressed in  loose phrases not to be taken as literal.    The news of Bjarne's voyage and of his discovery of land seems to have  been carried presently to the Norsemen in Iceland and in Europe. In  fact, Bjarne himself made a voyage to Norway, and, on account of what  he had done, figured there as a person of some importance. But people  blamed Bjarne because he had not landed on the new coasts, and had  taken so little pains to find out more about the region of hills and  forests which lay to the south and west of Greenland. Naturally others  were tempted to follow the matter further. Among these was Leif, son of  Eric the Red. Leif went to Greenland, found Bjarne, bought his ship,  and manned it with a crew of thirty-five. Leif's father, Eric, now  lived in Greenland, and Leif asked him to take command of the  expedition. He thought, the saga says, that, since Eric had found  Greenland, he would bring good luck to the new venture. For the time,  Eric consented, but when all was ready, and he was riding down to the  shore to embark, his horse stumbled and he fell from the saddle and  hurt his foot. Eric took this as an omen of evil, and would not go; but  Leif and his crew of thirty-five set sail towards the south-west. This  was in the year 1000 A.D., or four hundred and ninety-two years before  Columbus landed in the West Indies.    Leif and his men sailed on, the saga tells us, till they came to the  last land which Bjarne had discovered. Here they cast anchor, lowered a  boat, and rowed ashore. They found no grass, but only a great field of  snow stretching from the sea to the mountains farther inland; and these  mountains, too, glistened with snow. It seemed to the Norsemen a  forbidding place, and Leif christened it Helluland, or the country of  slate or flat stones. They did not linger, but sailed away at once. The  description of the snow-covered hills, the great slabs of stone, and  the desolate aspect of the coast conveys at least a very strong  probability that the land was Labrador.    Leif and his men sailed away, and soon they discovered another land.  The chronicle does not say how many days they were at sea, so that we  cannot judge of the distance of this new country from the Land of  Stones. But evidently it was entirely different in aspect, and was  situated in a warmer climate. The coast was low, there were broad  beaches of white sand, and behind the beaches rose thick forests  spreading over the country. Again the Norsemen landed. Because of the  trees, they gave to this place the name of Markland, or the Country of  Forests. Some writers have thought that Markland must have been  Newfoundland, but the description also suggests Cape Breton or Nova  Scotia."]]]
