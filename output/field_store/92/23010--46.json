And most of the things in question which have occurred have served to  restore and augment the confidence of the Italians in their position. A  new 2d Army has taken the place of the old, annihilated in the  Capporetto campaign. All the lost guns have been replaced and new  heavies added. Revolution is, at any moment, expected to break out in  Austria-Hungary, while the Congress of Jugoslavs in Rome on April 9-11  has secured the adhesion to the Allies of the subjects of the Hapsburgs  and enabled the Italian Government to make use of them as a fighting  force. There are now believed to be no German divisions on the Italian  front, where the entire enemy strength, not measurably increased since  the snows have disappeared in the north, consists of 800  Austro-Hungarian battalions, or less than 1,000,000 men.    But what has promoted most satisfaction in the Italian Government and  people was the decree issued by the Interallied Supreme Council of War  at Abbeville on May 3, giving General Foch authority to include the  Italian front under his supreme command, that front thereby becoming the  right wing of the allied battle line in Europe--now \"one army, one  front, and one supreme command.\"    That is the way Bonaparte fought his victorious battles in the days of  the First Republic, alternately on the Rhine and the Adige. Moreau could  not win without Bonaparte, nor Bonaparte without Moreau, while Carnot,  in the centre, was the vehicle of transit.    Before the snows made manoeuvres impossible the Italians had closed two  gates which threatened the plains of Veneto from the north--one at the  junction of the front with the Piave, one at the angle of the Frenzela  Torrent and the Brenta River.    Gunfire had been steadily augmenting on the front when, on May 10, they  closed another, and on May 15 still another. The first of these was the  capture of Monte Corno, which commanded the part up the Vallarsa, the  second was a partial recovery of Monte Asolone, between the Brenta and  the Piave, sufficient to cover the path up the Val San Lorenzo. Both  mountains are really plateaus of about two square miles area each, whose  irregular summits the enemy had strongly fortified in order to clear the  valleys below. In both places subsequent Austrian counterattacks were  broken up.    Meanwhile, Italian aircraft dominate from above. On May 14 the enemy  lost eleven airplanes with no losses to the Italians and the British,  who were assisting them.          Premier Lloyd George on German Autocracy      Premier Lloyd George wrote the following preface for a volume containing  extracts from speeches he delivered during the war:        I have never believed that the war would be a short war, or that in      some mysterious way, by negotiation or compromise, we would free      Europe from the malignant military autocracy which is endeavoring to      trample it into submission and moral death. I have always believed      that the machine which has established its despotic control over the      minds and the bodies of its victims and then organized and driven      them to slaughter in order to extend that control over the rest of      the world, would only be destroyed if the free peoples proved      themselves strong and steadfast enough to defeat its attempt in      arms. The events of the last few weeks must have made it plain to      every thinking man that there is no longer room for compromise      between the ideals for which we and our enemies stood. Democracy and      autocracy have come to death grips. One or the other will fasten its      hold on mankind. It is a clear realization of this issue which will      be our strength in the trials to come. I have no doubt that freedom      will triumph. But whether it will triumph soon or late, after a      final supreme effort in the next few months or a long-drawn agony,      depends on the vigor and self-sacrifice with which the children of      liberty, and especially those behind the lines, dedicate themselves      to the struggle. There is no time for ease or delay or debate. The      call is imperative. The choice is clear. It is for each free citizen      to do his part.          The Greatest Battle of the War    Second Month of the Desperate Fighting in Flanders and Picardy     By Philip Gibbs     _Special Correspondent With the British Armies_ [Copyrighted in United   States of America]      _The May issue of Current History Magazine contained Philip Gibbs's  story of the great German offensive up to April 18, 1918. At that time  the Germans were seeking to break the British lines in front of Ypres,  as part of their drive for Amiens and the British Channel ports,  generally known as the battle of Picardy. The pages here presented are a  continuation of his eyewitness narrative of the most sanguinary battle  in history._    April 18.--The arrival of French troops on our northern front is the  most important act that has happened during the last three or four days,  and it was with deep satisfaction that we met these troops on the roads  and knew that at last our poor, tired men would get support and help  against their overwhelming odds.    Beside the khaki army of the British has grown very quickly an army in  blue, the cornflower blue of the French poilus. They are splendid men,  hard and solid fellows, who have been war-worn and weather-worn during  these three and a half years past, and look the great fighting men who  have gone many times into battle and know all that war can teach them in  endurance and cunning and quick attack.    As they came marching up the roads to the front they were like a  streaming river of blue--blue helmets and coats and blue carts and blue  lorries, all blending into one tone through these April mists as they  went winding over the countryside and through French market towns, where  their own people waved to them, and then through the villages on the  edge of the Flanders battlefields, where they waited to go into action  under shell-broken walls or under hedges above which British shellfire  traveled, or in fields where they made their bivouacs, and fragrant  steams arose to one's nostrils as cuistots lifted the lids of stewpans  and hungry men gathered around after a long march.    The attack this morning from Robecq, below St. Venant, down to Givenchy,  is a serious effort to gain La Bassee Canal and form a strong defensive  flank for the enemy while he proceeds with his battles further north and  also to get more elbow room from the salient in which he is narrowly  wedged below Merville.    For this purpose he brought up several more divisions, including the  239th, which was in the Somme fighting of March, but not heavily  engaged. This one attacked the British at Robecq and was repulsed with  heavy losses. It was at a place called La Bacquerolles Farm, near  Robecq, where after heavy shelling last night the enemy rushed one of  the outposts at 10 o'clock. In order to facilitate the attack this  morning of German divisions north and south at 4 o'clock the German guns  began a heavy bombardment of the British lines as far down as Givenchy  and maintained it for five hours, using large numbers of gas shells, on  account of the east wind, which was in their favor.    His guns shelled the bridges across the canal in the hope of preventing  the British supports going up. Then his troops came forward in waves on  a wide front. They were in immense numbers as usual, with many mixed  battalions. One of the British units today took prisoners from ten  different regiments. There were some ten German divisions facing four  British ones north of Bethune, and all along the line the troops were  much outnumbered; nevertheless, the enemy was repulsed at all but a few  points of attack and beaten back bloodily.      THE GHASTLY LOSSES    In this battle one regiment of the 42d German Division has lost over 50  per cent. of its strength, and other losses are on a similar scale.  These ghastly casualties have been piling up along this line between  Merville and Bethune since the 13th of this month, when the Germans made  a series of small attacks as a prelude to today's battle, owing, it  seems, to battalion officers taking the initiative without orders from  the High Command, in order to push forward and break the British lines  if they could find weakness there.    On the 13th and 14th some of the South Country troops were attacked by  strong forces repeatedly, and on the second day for five hours at a  stretch the enemy endeavored to come across from houses and inclosures  west of Merville toward St. Venant. For those five hours the South  Country lads fired with rifles, Lewis guns, and machine guns into solid  bodies of Germans, and their field guns tore gaps in the enemy's  formations and broke up their assemblies before the attacks could  proceed. One advance in five waves was mown down before it could make  any progress, and others were dealt with in the same way.    _Mr. Gibbs describes the German repulse between Robecq and Givenchy as a  \"black day for the enemy,\" and continues:_    April 19.--At the end of the day all the enemy's efforts ended in bloody  failure, in spite of the daring and courage of his troops, who  sacrificed themselves under the British fire, but were only able to gain  a few bits of trench work and one or two outposts below the fortified  works at Givenchy, which are quite useless to them for immediate or  future use.    It was a big attack, for which they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41481"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science January 1930 (#7)"],[1," worst circumstances,  fell to with a will. He was enjoying his meal when he happened to look  up, and saw that the penumbra at the edge of the lighted zone was dense  with beetles.    Thousands--perhaps millions, for they stretched away as far as the eye  could see, were packed together, their antenna waving in unison, their  heads, beneath the shells, directed toward the fire.    Bram saw Tommy's look of disgust, and laughed. \"The fire seems to  intoxicate them, Travers,\" he said. \"They always throng the entrance  when I'm here. It's as far as they dare go. They're quite blind in the  least light. Care to smoke? I've learned the art of making some quite  decent cigars.\" He produced a handful. \"Oh, by the way, you didn't see  my lighter anywhere, did you?\" he went on, with a pretense of  carelessness.    \"No,\" lied Tommy. \"I was surprised you--\"    \"Oh, there's a supply of petrol in the rocks. No matter,\" answered Bram  carelessly. \"Your friend looks bad,\" he added, glancing at Dodd, who had  fallen asleep. \"Travers, I'm sorry I lost my temper. The--the shock of  meeting men from the upper world, you know.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dodd opened his eyes and tried to whisper. Tommy bent over him and  listened.    \"He wants to know whether he can have that girl to take care of him,\" he  said.    \"What, the one I saw you with? Why, she's a cull, Travers.\"    \"What d'you mean?\" asked Tommy.    \"Why--useless, you know. There's several of them running loose, and  waiting to be rounded up. We raise two breeds, one for replenishing the  stock, and one for meat. She's just a cull, a reversion, no use for  either purpose. I'll have her brought by all means. I--I like Dodd. I  want to get him to like me,\" Bram went on, with a sort of penitence  that had a pathetic touch. \"Our little differences--quite absurd, and I  can prove he's wrong in his ideas.    \"Make yourself comfortable as long as you're here, Travers, and don't  mind me. Only, don't try to escape. The beetles will get you if you do,  and there's no way out of here--none that you'll find. And don't try to  follow me. But you're a sensible man, and we'll all get along famously,  I'm sure, as soon as Dodd recovers.\"          CHAPTER V    _Doomed!_      There were no means known to Tommy of reckoning time in that strange  place of twilight. His watch had been broken in the airplane fall; and  Dodd never remembered to wind his, but they estimated that about two  weeks had passed, judging from the number of times they had slept and  eaten.    In those two weeks they had gradually begun to grow accustomed to their  surroundings. Haidia, the girl, had arrived on beetle-back within an  hour after Bram's departure, apparently into a cleft of the rocks--how  he had communicated his order to the beetle steeds Tommy had no idea.  And under the girl's ministrations Dodd was making good progress toward  recovery.    That Haidia was in love with Dodd in quite a human way was evident. To  please the girl, both Dodd and Tommy had learned to eat the raw shrimps,  which, being bloodless, were really no worse than oysters, and had a  flavor half-way between shrimp and crawfish. To please the men, Haidia  tried not to shudder when she saw them devouring the breadfruit and  nectarines of which Bram always had a plentiful supply. Bram was  solicitous in his inquiries for Dodd's health.    \"Jim, I've been thinking about our chances of getting away,\" said Tommy  one morning. \"It's evident Bram's only waiting for your recovery to put  some proposition up to us. Suppose you were to feign paralysis.\"    \"How d'you mean? What for?\" demanded Dodd.    \"If he thinks you're helpless, he'll be less on his guard. You haven't  walked about in his presence.\" That was true, for the activities of the  two had been nocturnal, when Bram had vanished. \"Let him think a nerve's  been severed in your neck, or something of the sort. If it doesn't work,  you can always get better.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dodd's realistic portrayal of a man with a partly paralyzed right side  brought cries of horror from Bram next morning. Solicitously he helped  Dodd back to the couch. Bram, when not under the influence of his drug,  had moments of human feeling.    \"Can't you move that arm and leg at all, Dodd?\" he asked. \"No feeling in  them?\"    \"There's plenty of feeling,\" growled Dodd, \"but they don't seem to work,  that's all.\"    \"You'll get better,\" said Bram eagerly. \"You must get better. I need  you, Dodd, in spite of our differences. There's work for all of us,  wonderful work. A new humanity, waiting to be born, Dodd, not of the  miserable ape race, but of--of--\"    He checked himself, and a cunning look came over his face. He turned  away abruptly.    At the end of two weeks or so, an amazing thing happened. One day  Haidia, with a look of triumph in her eyes, addressed Dodd with a few  English words!    Her brain, which had probably developed certain faculties in different  proportions from those of the upper human race, had registered every  word that either of the two men had ever spoken, and remembered it. As  soon as Dodd ascertained this, he began to instruct her, and, with her  abnormal faculties of memory, it was not long before she could talk  quite intelligently. The obstacle that had stood between them was swept  away. She became one of themselves.    In the days that followed the girl told them brokenly something of the  history of her race, of the legend of the universal flood that had  driven them down into the bowels of the earth, of the centuries-long  struggle with the beetles, and of the insects' gradual conquest of  humanity, and the final reduction of the human race to a miserable,  helpless remnant.           *       *       *       *       *    Everywhere, Haidia told them, were beetle swarms, everywhere humanity  had been reduced to a few handfuls. Bram, by breeding mankind from  prolific strains, and using the new-born progeny for food, had  temporarily averted universal starvation. But a new swarm of beetles was  due to hatch out shortly, and then--    The girl, with a shudder, put her hand to her bosom, and brought out a  little bright-eyed lizard.    \"The old man you saw with me, who is one of our wise elders, has told  our people that these things feed upon the beetle larvae,\" she said. \"We  are putting them secretly into the nests. But what can a few lizards do  against millions.\" She looked up. \"In the earth above us, the beetle  larvae extend for miles, in a solid mass,\" she said. \"When they come out  as beetles, it will be the end of all of us.\"    Bram had grown less suspicious as the time passed. His sudden visits to  the cavern had ceased. Dodd and Tommy knew that he spent the nights--if  they could be termed nights--lying in a drugged slumber somewhere among  the rocks. They had asked Haidia whether there was any way of escape  into the upper world.    \"There are two ways from here,\" answered the girl. \"One is the way you  came, but it is impossible to pass the beetle guards without being torn  to pieces. The other--\"    She shuddered, and for an instant drew back the film from across her  pupils, then uttered a little cry of pain at the light, dim though it  was.    \"There is a bridge across that terrible monster that devours all it  touches,\" she said, shuddering, meaning the fire.    Suddenly Dodd had an inspiration. He still had the fur coat that he had  worn, and, reaching into a pocket he drew out a pair of snow goggles,  which he adjusted over Haidia's nose.    \"Now look!\" he said.    Haidia looked, blinked and, with an effort kept her eyes open. She gazed  at Dodd in amazement. Dodd laughed, and pulled her toward him. He kissed  her, and Haidia's eyes closed.    \"What is this?\" she murmured. \"First you give me medicine that opens my  eyes, and then you give me medicine that closes them.\"    \"That's nothing,\" grinned Dodd. \"Wait till you understand me better.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bram's eyes were preternaturally bright. It was evident that he had been  increasing his dose of late, and that he was fully under the influence  of it now.    \"Well, gentlemen, the time has come for us to be frank with one  another,\" he said, as the three were gathered about the little table,  while Haidia crouched in a far corner of the cave. \"I want you to work  for me in my plans for the regeneration of humanity. The time for which  I have long labored is almost at hand. Any day now the new swarm of  beetles may emerge from the pupal stage. But before I speak further,  come and see them, gentlemen!\"    He rose, and Dodd and Tommy rose too, Tommy supporting Dodd, who let his  arm and leg trail awkwardly as he moved.    Bram led the way into the cleft among the rocks into which he had been  in the habit of passing. Beyond this opening the two men saw another  smaller cavern, with a beetle guard standing on either side, antenna  waving.    Bram shrilled a sound, and the antenna dropped. The three passed  through. Tommy saw a hair-cloth pallet set against the rocks, a table,  and a chair. Beyond was a sloping ramp of earth. Overhead was a rock  ceiling.    Bram led the way up the ramp, and the three stepped through a gap in the  rocks and found themselves on an extensive prairie. But in place of the  red grass there was a vast sea of mud.    By the light cast by the petrol fire, which roared up in the distance, a  veritable fiery fountain, the two Americans could see that the mud was  filled with huge encysted forms, grubs three or four feet long,  motionless in the soil.           *       *       *       *       *    Bram scooped up one of them and tossed it into the air. It thudded to  their feet and remained motionless.    \"As far as you can see, and for miles beyond, these pupae of the beetles  lie buried in the decaying vegetation in which the eggs were hatched,\"  said Bram. \"Every century and a half, so far as I"]]]
