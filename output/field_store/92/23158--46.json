The work had evidently been wrought by a master hand,  so subtle the atmosphere, so perfect the technique; yet nowhere was  there a representation of a living animal, either human or brute, by  which I could guess at the likeness of these other and perhaps extinct  denizens of Mars.    While I was allowing my fancy to run riot in wild conjecture on the  possible explanation of the strange anomalies which I had so far met  with on Mars, Sola returned bearing both food and drink.  These she  placed on the floor beside me, and seating herself a short ways off  regarded me intently.  The food consisted of about a pound of some  solid substance of the consistency of cheese and almost tasteless,  while the liquid was apparently milk from some animal.  It was not  unpleasant to the taste, though slightly acid, and I learned in a short  time to prize it very highly.  It came, as I later discovered, not from  an animal, as there is only one mammal on Mars and that one very rare  indeed, but from a large plant which grows practically without water,  but seems to distill its plentiful supply of milk from the products of  the soil, the moisture of the air, and the rays of the sun.  A single  plant of this species will give eight or ten quarts of milk per day.    After I had eaten I was greatly invigorated, but feeling the need of  rest I stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep.  I must have  slept several hours, as it was dark when I awoke, and I was very cold.  I noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me, but it had become  partially dislodged and in the darkness I could not see to replace it.  Suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me, shortly  afterwards adding another to my covering.    I presumed that my watchful guardian was Sola, nor was I wrong.  This  girl alone, among all the green Martians with whom I came in contact,  disclosed characteristics of sympathy, kindliness, and affection; her  ministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing, and her solicitous  care saved me from much suffering and many hardships.    As I was to learn, the Martian nights are extremely cold, and as there  is practically no twilight or dawn, the changes in temperature are  sudden and most uncomfortable, as are the transitions from brilliant  daylight to darkness.  The nights are either brilliantly illumined or  very dark, for if neither of the two moons of Mars happen to be in the  sky almost total darkness results, since the lack of atmosphere, or,  rather, the very thin atmosphere, fails to diffuse the starlight to any  great extent; on the other hand, if both of the moons are in the  heavens at night the surface of the ground is brightly illuminated.    Both of Mars' moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to Earth;  the nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant, while the  further is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away, against  the nearly one-quarter million miles which separate us from our moon.  The nearer moon of Mars makes a complete revolution around the planet  in a little over seven and one-half hours, so that she may be seen  hurtling through the sky like some huge meteor two or three times each  night, revealing all her phases during each transit of the heavens.    The further moon revolves about Mars in something over thirty and  one-quarter hours, and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnal  Martian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur.  And it is well that  nature has so graciously and abundantly lighted the Martian night, for  the green men of Mars, being a nomadic race without high intellectual  development, have but crude means for artificial lighting; depending  principally upon torches, a kind of candle, and a peculiar oil lamp  which generates a gas and burns without a wick.    This last device produces an intensely brilliant far-reaching white  light, but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained by  mining in one of several widely separated and remote localities it is  seldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for today, and  whose hatred for manual labor has kept them in a semi-barbaric state  for countless ages.    After Sola had replenished my coverings I again slept, nor did I awaken  until daylight.  The other occupants of the room, five in number, were  all females, and they were still sleeping, piled high with a motley  array of silks and furs.  Across the threshold lay stretched the  sleepless guardian brute, just as I had last seen him on the preceding  day; apparently he had not moved a muscle; his eyes were fairly glued  upon me, and I fell to wondering just what might befall me should I  endeavor to escape.    I have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and  experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone.  It  therefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the exact  attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room.  I felt fairly secure in my belief that I could escape him should he  pursue me once I was outside the building, for I had begun to take  great pride in my ability as a jumper.  Furthermore, I could see from  the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper and  probably no runner.    Slowly and carefully, therefore, I gained my feet, only to see that my  watcher did the same; cautiously I advanced toward him, finding that by  moving with a shuffling gait I could retain my balance as well as make  reasonably rapid progress.  As I neared the brute he backed cautiously  away from me, and when I had reached the open he moved to one side to  let me pass.  He then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces in  my rear as I made my way along the deserted street.    Evidently his mission was to protect me only, I thought, but when we  reached the edge of the city he suddenly sprang before me, uttering  strange sounds and baring his ugly and ferocious tusks.  Thinking to  have some amusement at his expense, I rushed toward him, and when  almost upon him sprang into the air, alighting far beyond him and away  from the city.  He wheeled instantly and charged me with the most  appalling speed I had ever beheld.  I had thought his short legs a bar  to swiftness, but had he been coursing with greyhounds the latter would  have appeared as though asleep on a door mat.  As I was to learn, this  is the fleetest animal on Mars, and owing to its intelligence, loyalty,  and ferocity is used in hunting, in war, and as the protector of the  Martian man.    I quickly saw that I would have difficulty in escaping the fangs of the  beast on a straightaway course, and so I met his charge by doubling in  my tracks and leaping over him as he was almost upon me.  This maneuver  gave me a considerable advantage, and I was able to reach the city  quite a bit ahead of him, and as he came tearing after me I jumped for  a window about thirty feet from the ground in the face of one of the  buildings overlooking the valley.    Grasping the sill I pulled myself up to a sitting posture without  looking into the building, and gazed down at the baffled animal beneath  me.  My exultation was short-lived, however, for scarcely had I gained  a secure seat upon the sill than a huge hand grasped me by the neck  from behind and dragged me violently into the room.  Here I was thrown  upon my back, and beheld standing over me a colossal ape-like creature,  white and hairless except for an enormous shock of bristly hair upon  its head.          CHAPTER VI    A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS      The thing, which more nearly resembled our earthly men than it did the  Martians I had seen, held me pinioned to the ground with one huge foot,  while it jabbered and gesticulated at some answering creature behind  me.  This other, which was evidently its mate, soon came toward us,  bearing a mighty stone cudgel with which it evidently intended to brain  me.    The creatures were about ten or fifteen feet tall, standing erect, and  had, like the green Martians, an intermediary set of arms or legs,  midway between their upper and lower limbs.  Their eyes were close  together and non-protruding; their ears were high set, but more  laterally located than those of the Martians, while their snouts and  teeth were strikingly like those of our African gorilla.  Altogether  they were not unlovely when viewed in comparison with the green  Martians.    The cudgel was swinging in the arc which ended upon my upturned face  when a bolt of myriad-legged horror hurled itself through the doorway  full upon the breast of my executioner.  With a shriek of fear the ape  which held me leaped through the open window, but its mate closed in a  terrific death struggle with my preserver, which was nothing less than  my faithful watch-thing; I cannot bring myself to call so hideous a  creature a dog.    As quickly as possible I gained my feet and backing against the wall I  witnessed such a battle as it is vouchsafed few beings to see.  The  strength, agility, and blind ferocity of these two creatures is  approached by nothing known to earthly man.  My beast had an advantage  in his first hold, having sunk his mighty fangs far into the breast of  his adversary; but the great arms and paws of the ape, backed by  muscles far transcending those of the Martian men I had seen, had  locked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking out his life,  and bending back his head and neck upon his body, where I momentarily  expected the former to fall limp at the end of a broken neck.    In accomplishing this the ape was tearing away the entire front of its  breast, which was held in the vise-like grip of the powerful jaws.  Back and forth upon the floor they rolled, neither one emitting a sound  of fear or pain.  Presently I saw the great eyes of my beast bulging  completely from their sockets and blood flowing from its nostrils."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#7)"],[1," May 30th, 1887.\"    My companion regarded me musingly for some moments. Then he observed,  \"And you tell me that even then there was no general recognition of the  nature of the crisis which society was nearing? Of course, I fully  credit your statement. The singular blindness of your contemporaries to  the signs of the times is a phenomenon commented on by many of our  historians, but few facts of history are more difficult for us to  realize, so obvious and unmistakable as we look back seem the  indications, which must also have come under your eyes, of the  transformation about to come to pass. I should be interested, Mr. West,  if you would give me a little more definite idea of the view which you  and men of your grade of intellect took of the state and prospects of  society in 1887. You must, at least, have realized that the widespread  industrial and social troubles, and the underlying dissatisfaction of  all classes with the inequalities of society, and the general misery of  mankind, were portents of great changes of some sort.\"    \"We did, indeed, fully realize that,\" I replied. \"We felt that society  was dragging anchor and in danger of going adrift. Whither it would  drift nobody could say, but all feared the rocks.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said Dr. Leete, \"the set of the current was perfectly  perceptible if you had but taken pains to observe it, and it was not  toward the rocks, but toward a deeper channel.\"    \"We had a popular proverb,\" I replied, \"that 'hindsight is better than  foresight,' the force of which I shall now, no doubt, appreciate more  fully than ever. All I can say is, that the prospect was such when I  went into that long sleep that I should not have been surprised had I  looked down from your house-top to-day on a heap of charred and  moss-grown ruins instead of this glorious city.\"    Dr. Leete had listened to me with close attention and nodded  thoughtfully as I finished speaking. \"What you have said,\" he observed,  \"will be regarded as a most valuable vindication of Storiot, whose  account of your era has been generally thought exaggerated in its  picture of the gloom and confusion of men's minds. That a period of  transition like that should be full of excitement and agitation was  indeed to be looked for; but seeing how plain was the tendency of the  forces in operation, it was natural to believe that hope rather than  fear would have been the prevailing temper of the popular mind.\"    \"You have not yet told me what was the answer to the riddle which you  found,\" I said. \"I am impatient to know by what contradiction of  natural sequence the peace and prosperity which you now seem to enjoy  could have been the outcome of an era like my own.\"    \"Excuse me,\" replied my host, \"but do you smoke?\" It was not till our  cigars were lighted and drawing well that he resumed. \"Since you are in  the humor to talk rather than to sleep, as I certainly am, perhaps I  cannot do better than to try to give you enough idea of our modern  industrial system to dissipate at least the impression that there is  any mystery about the process of its evolution. The Bostonians of your  day had the reputation of being great askers of questions, and I am  going to show my descent by asking you one to begin with. What should  you name as the most prominent feature of the labor troubles of your  day?\"    \"Why, the strikes, of course,\" I replied.    \"Exactly; but what made the strikes so formidable?\"    \"The great labor organizations.\"    \"And what was the motive of these great organizations?\"    \"The workmen claimed they had to organize to get their rights from the  big corporations,\" I replied.    \"That is just it,\" said Dr. Leete; \"the organization of labor and the  strikes were an effect, merely, of the concentration of capital in  greater masses than had ever been known before. Before this  concentration began, while as yet commerce and industry were conducted  by innumerable petty concerns with small capital, instead of a small  number of great concerns with vast capital, the individual workman was  relatively important and independent in his relations to the employer.  Moreover, when a little capital or a new idea was enough to start a man  in business for himself, workingmen were constantly becoming employers  and there was no hard and fast line between the two classes. Labor  unions were needless then, and general strikes out of the question. But  when the era of small concerns with small capital was succeeded by that  of the great aggregations of capital, all this was changed. The  individual laborer, who had been relatively important to the small  employer, was reduced to insignificance and powerlessness over against  the great corporation, while at the same time the way upward to the  grade of employer was closed to him. Self-defense drove him to union  with his fellows.    \"The records of the period show that the outcry against the  concentration of capital was furious. Men believed that it threatened  society with a form of tyranny more abhorrent than it had ever endured.  They believed that the great corporations were preparing for them the  yoke of a baser servitude than had ever been imposed on the race,  servitude not to men but to soulless machines incapable of any motive  but insatiable greed. Looking back, we cannot wonder at their  desperation, for certainly humanity was never confronted with a fate  more sordid and hideous than would have been the era of corporate  tyranny which they anticipated.    \"Meanwhile, without being in the smallest degree checked by the clamor  against it, the absorption of business by ever larger monopolies  continued. In the United States there was not, after the beginning of  the last quarter of the century, any opportunity whatever for  individual enterprise in any important field of industry, unless backed  by a great capital. During the last decade of the century, such small  businesses as still remained were fast-failing survivals of a past  epoch, or mere parasites on the great corporations, or else existed in  fields too small to attract the great capitalists. Small businesses, as  far as they still remained, were reduced to the condition of rats and  mice, living in holes and corners, and counting on evading notice for  the enjoyment of existence. The railroads had gone on combining till a  few great syndicates controlled every rail in the land. In  manufactories, every important staple was controlled by a syndicate.  These syndicates, pools, trusts, or whatever their name, fixed prices  and crushed all competition except when combinations as vast as  themselves arose. Then a struggle, resulting in a still greater  consolidation, ensued. The great city bazar crushed it country rivals  with branch stores, and in the city itself absorbed its smaller rivals  till the business of a whole quarter was concentrated under one roof,  with a hundred former proprietors of shops serving as clerks. Having no  business of his own to put his money in, the small capitalist, at the  same time that he took service under the corporation, found no other  investment for his money but its stocks and bonds, thus becoming doubly  dependent upon it.    \"The fact that the desperate popular opposition to the consolidation of  business in a few powerful hands had no effect to check it proves that  there must have been a strong economical reason for it. The small  capitalists, with their innumerable petty concerns, had in fact yielded  the field to the great aggregations of capital, because they belonged  to a day of small things and were totally incompetent to the demands of  an age of steam and telegraphs and the gigantic scale of its  enterprises. To restore the former order of things, even if possible,  would have involved returning to the day of stagecoaches. Oppressive  and intolerable as was the regime of the great consolidations of  capital, even its victims, while they cursed it, were forced to admit  the prodigious increase of efficiency which had been imparted to the  national industries, the vast economies effected by concentration of  management and unity of organization, and to confess that since the new  system had taken the place of the old the wealth of the world had  increased at a rate before undreamed of. To be sure this vast increase  had gone chiefly to make the rich richer, increasing the gap between  them and the poor; but the fact remained that, as a means merely of  producing wealth, capital had been proved efficient in proportion to  its consolidation. The restoration of the old system with the  subdivision of capital, if it were possible, might indeed bring back a  greater equality of conditions, with more individual dignity and  freedom, but it would be at the price of general poverty and the arrest  of material progress.    \"Was there, then, no way of commanding the services of the mighty  wealth-producing principle of consolidated capital without bowing down  to a plutocracy like that of Carthage? As soon as men began to ask  themselves these questions, they found the answer ready for them. The  movement toward the conduct of business by larger and larger  aggregations of capital, the tendency toward monopolies, which had been  so desperately and vainly resisted, was recognized at last, in its true  significance, as a process which only needed to complete its logical  evolution to open a golden future to humanity.    \"Early in the last century the evolution was completed by the final  consolidation of the entire capital of the nation. The industry and  commerce of the country, ceasing to be conducted by a set of  irresponsible corporations and syndicates of private persons at their  caprice and for their profit, were intrusted to a single syndicate  representing the people, to be conducted in the common interest for the  common profit. The nation, that is to say, organized as the one great  business corporation in which all other corporations"]]]
