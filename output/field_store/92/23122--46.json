At  last she asked Suffolk to marry her, which he did in secret. After this  Francis was free from any further need of conciliating Henry, who must  take back his sister on any terms, and Wolsey was left to appease Henry  as best he could. In April Mary and Suffolk returned to England, and in  May the luckless pair were publicly married. Wolsey manfully befriended  Suffolk in this matter, but the calculations of his diplomacy were  hopelessly upset by private feelings and the rashness of passion.    However, Mary received part of her dowry and some of her jewels. Francis  I. had no wish to quarrel with England, but only to make the best terms  for himself. He was bent upon gathering laurels in Italy, and on 5th  April renewed the alliance between France and England. This time,  however, the treaty was little more than a truce, and many questions  were left untouched; no mention was made of the return of Tournai, and  the question of Mary's jewels was left undecided. Francis I. counted on  keeping England quiet by an alliance which he formed at the same time  with Ferdinand, while he won over the Flemish counsellors of Prince  Charles, who betrothed himself to the infant daughter of Louis XII.,  Renée, a child of four.    Thus he had cleared the way for an expedition to Italy, where he longed  to claim for France the Duchy of Milan, that had been won and lost by  Louis XII. In July he set out contentedly, knowing that Henry was  powerless to interfere. He treated England with neglect, and gave Henry  no information of his movements. England looked on with growing jealousy  while Francis crossed the Alps and in September defeated the Swiss  mercenaries who held Milan in the name of the last Sforza Duke. The  battle of Marignano (14th September) was a splendid success for Francis,  who there beat back the Swiss infantry, hitherto considered invincible  in Europe. The star of France had risen, and Francis could look round  with proud superiority.    The princes of Europe were alarmed beyond measure at the completeness of  the French success. They had looked with equanimity at the preparations  of Francis, because they expected that he would be delayed, or, if he  attacked the Swiss, would be defeated. But his rapid march soon  convinced men that he was in earnest, and especially excited the fear of  Pope Leo X., whose ingenious policy of being secretly allied with  everybody was disturbed by this display of unexpected vigour. The alarm  of the Pope was useful to Wolsey. It awakened him to the need of making  the English king his friend, and fulfilling his desire to have Wolsey  created cardinal. Wolsey had not ceased, through his agent, the Bishop  of Worcester, to urge this point upon the Pope, and when Francis was  well advanced on his road to Milan the pleadings of Wolsey were  irresistible. \"If the King of England forsake the Pope,\" wrote Wolsey to  the Bishop of Worcester, \"he will be in greater danger on this day two  years than ever was Pope Julius.\" Leo X. had no wish to run the risks  which the impetuous Julius II. faced with unbroken spirit. He prepared  to keep himself supplied with allies to protect him against all  emergencies, and on 10th September nominated Wolsey cardinal sole, a  special mark of favour, as cardinals were generally created in batches  at intervals.    Wolsey's creation was not popular in the Roman Court. Cardinal  Bainbridge had been overbearing in manner and hasty in temper, and the  English were disliked for their outspokenness. England was regarded as a  political upstart, and Wolsey was considered to be a fitting emblem of  the country which he represented. Moreover, the attitude of England in  ecclesiastical matters was not marked by that subservience which the  Papacy wished to exact, and many doubted the expediency of exalting in  ecclesiastical authority an English prelate of such far-reaching views  as Wolsey was known to hold. An official of the Roman Court gives the  following account of the current opinion:--    \"Men say that an English Cardinal ought not to be created lightly,  because the English behave themselves insolently in that dignity, as was  shown in the case of Cardinal Bainbridge just dead. Moreover, as Wolsey  is the intimate friend of the king, he will not be contented with the  Cardinalate alone, but, as is the custom of these barbarians, will wish  to have the office of legate over all England. If this be granted the  influence of the Roman Court will be at an end; if it be not granted the  Cardinal will be the Pope's enemy and will favour France. But despite  all this the Pope, in whose hands alone the matter was, created him  Cardinal on the seventh of September.\"    This elevation of Wolsey was due to the strong expression of desire on  the part of Henry, who further asked that legatine powers should be  given to the new cardinal. This Leo refused for the present; he had done  enough to induce Henry to enter into a secret league for the protection  of the Church, which meant a convenient pretext for attacking Francis if  he became too powerful in Italy. When this was arranged the red hat was  sent to England, and its reception gave Wolsey an opportunity of  displaying his love for magnificent ceremonial. On 17th November it was  placed on his head by Archbishop Warham in Westminster Abbey.    Ceremonial, however splendid, was but an episode in Wolsey's diplomatic  business. The news of the French victory at Marignano was so unpleasant  that Henry VIII. for some time refused to believe it to be true. When at  last it was impossible to doubt any longer, the necessity became urgent  to put a spoke in the wheel of Francis I. England was not prepared to go  to war with France without allies, and Wolsey developed his cleverness  in attaining his ends by secret means. Nothing could be done by uniting  with the cautious Ferdinand; but the flighty Maximilian was a more  hopeful subject. The only troops that could be used against France were  the German and Swiss mercenaries, men who made war a trade, and were  trained and disciplined soldiers. The first means of injuring France was  to prevent her from hiring Swiss soldiers, and the second was to induce  Maximilian to undertake an Italian expedition in his own interests. As  regards the Swiss, it was merely a matter of money, for they were ready  to sell themselves to the highest bidder. In like manner it was easy to  subsidise Maximilian, but it was difficult to hold him to his promise  and be sure that he would spend the money on the right purpose. Wolsey,  however, resolved to try and use Maximilian; he offered him the aid of a  large contingent of the Swiss if he would attack Milan. Knowing the  delicacy of the enterprise and the slipperiness of Maximilian, Wolsey  entrusted this matter to a man whose pertinacity had been already  tried,--Richard Pace, secretary of Cardinal Bainbridge, who had  stubbornly insisted on an investigation of the circumstances of his  master's death, and had annoyed the Roman Court by his watchful care of  his master's effects. Pace was sent to hire soldiers amongst the Swiss,  and Wolsey's ingenuity was sorely tried to supply him with money  secretly and safely.    The hindrances which beset Pace in carrying out his instructions  decorously were very many. Not the least troublesome was the want of  intelligence displayed by Sir Robert Wingfield, the English envoy to  Maximilian. Wingfield belonged to the old school of English officials,  honest and industrious, but entirely incapable of _finesse_. He did not  understand what Pace was about; he could not comprehend Wolsey's hints,  but was a blind admirer of Maximilian, and was made his tool in his  efforts to get the gold of England and do nothing in return. But Pace  was deaf to the entreaties of Maximilian and to the lofty remonstrances  of Wingfield. He raised 17,000 Swiss soldiers, who were to serve under  their own general, and whose pay was not to pass through Maximilian's  hands. Maximilian was sorely disappointed at this result, but led his  troops to join the Swiss in an attack on Milan. On 24th March 1516, the  combined army was a few miles from Milan, which was poorly defended, and  victory seemed secure. Suddenly Maximilian began to hesitate, and then  drew off his forces and retired. We can only guess at the motive of this  strange proceeding; perhaps he had never been in earnest, and only meant  to extract money from England. When Pace refused to pay he probably  negotiated with Francis I., and obtained money from him. Anyhow his  withdrawal was fatal to the expedition. The Germans at Brescia seized  the money which was sent to Pace for the payment of the Swiss. The Swiss  in anger mutinied, and Pace was for some days thrown into prison.  Maximilian vaguely promised to return, but the Swiss troops naturally  disbanded. Such was Maximilian's meanness that he threatened Pace, now  deserted and broken by disappointment, that if he did not advance him  money he would make peace with France. Pace, afraid to run the risk,  pledged Henry VIII. to pay 60,000 florins. All this time Wingfield was  convinced that it was Pace's ill-judged parsimony that had wrought this  disaster, and he continued to write in a strain of superior wisdom to  Wolsey. He even, at Maximilian's bidding, forged Pace's name to receipts  for money. Never was diplomat in more hopeless plight than the unlucky  Pace.    Wolsey saw that his plan had failed, but he put a good face upon his  failure. Maximilian enjoyed the advantage which consummate meanness  always gives for a moment. He put down the failure to niggardliness in  the supplies, and showed his goodwill towards Henry by treating him to  fantastic proposals. If Henry would only cross to Flanders with 6000  men, Maximilian would meet him with his army, set him up as Duke of  Milan, and resign the Empire in his favour. This preposterous scheme did  not for a moment dazzle the good"]]]
