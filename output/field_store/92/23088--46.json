Bacon's conception of \"Experiments in concert\" was thus realised, the  scattered forces of science were converted into a regular army, and  emulation and jealousy became out of place, for the results obtained  by any one observer were of no value till they were combined with  those of the others.    The increase in the accuracy and completeness of magnetic observations  which was obtained by the new method, opened up fields of research  which were hardly suspected to exist by those whose observations of  the magnetic needle had been conducted in a more primitive manner.  We  must reserve for its proper place in our course any detailed  description of the disturbances to which the magnetism of our planet  is found to be subject.  Some of these disturbances are periodic,  following the regular courses of the sun and moon.  Others are sudden,  and are called magnetic storms, but, like the storms of the  atmosphere, they have their known seasons of frequency.  The last and  the most mysterious of these magnetic changes is that secular  variation by which the whole character of the earth, as a great  magnet, is being slowly modified, while the magnetic poles creep on,  from century to century, along their winding track in the polar  regions.    We have thus learned that the interior of the earth is subject to the  influences of the heavenly bodies, but that besides this there is a  constantly progressive change going on, the cause of which is entirely  unknown.  In each of the magnetic observatories throughout the world  an arrangement is at work, by means of which a suspended magnet  directs a ray of light on a preparred sheet of paper moved by  clockwork.  On that paper the never-resting heart of the earth is now  tracing, in telegraphic symbols which will one day be interpreted, a  record of its pulsations and its flutterings, as well as of that slow  but mighty working which warns us that we must not suppose that the  inner history of our planet is ended.    But this great experimental research on Terrestrial Magnetism produced  lasting effects on the progress of science in general.  I need only  mention one or two instances.  The new methods of measuring forces  were successfully applied by Weber to the numerical determination of  all the phenomena of electricity, and very soon afterwards the  electric telegraph, by conferring a commercial value on exact  numerical measurements, contributed largely to the advancement, as  well as to the diffusion of scientific knowledge.    But it is not in these more modern branches of science alone that this  influence is felt.  It is to Gauss, to the Magnetic Union, and to  magnetic observers in general, that we owe our deliverance from that  absurd method of estimating forces by a variable standard which  prevailed so long even among men of science.  It was Gauss who first  based the practical measurement of magnetic force (and therefore of  every other force) on those long established principles, which, though  they are embodied in every dynamical equation, have been so generally  set aside, that these very equations, though correctly given in our  Cambridge textbooks, are usually explained there by assuming, in  addition to the variable standard of force, a variable, and therefore  illegal, standard of mass.    Such, then, were some of the scientific results which followed in this  case from bringing together mathematical power, experimental sagacity,  and manipulative skill, to direct and assist the labours of a body of  zealous observers.  If therefore we desire, for our own advantage and  for the honour of our University, that the Devonshire Laboratory  should be successful, we must endeavour to maintain it in living union  with the other organs and faculties of our learned body.  We shall  therefore first consider the relation in which we stand to those  mathematical studies which have so long flourished among us, which  deal with our own subjects, and which differ from our experimental  studies only in the mode in which they are presented to the mind.    There is no more powerful method for introducing knowledge into the  mind than that of presenting it in as many different ways as we can.  When the ideas, after entering through different gateways, effect a  junction in the citadel of the mind, the position they occupy becomes  impregnable.  Opticians tell us that the mental combination of the  views of an object which we obtain from stations no further apart than  our two eyes is sufficient to produce in our minds an impression of  the solidity of the object seen; and we find that this impression is  produced even when we are aware that we are really looking at two flat  pictures placed in a stereoscope.  It is therefore natural to expect  that the knowledge of physical science obtained by the combined use of  mathematical analysis and experimental research will be of a more  solid, available, and enduring kind than that possessed by the mere  mathematician or the mere experimenter.    But what will be the effect on the University, if men Pursuing that  course of reading which has produced so many distinguished Wranglers,  turn aside to work experiments?  Will not their attendance at the  Laboratory count not merely as time withdrawn from their more  legitimate studies, but as the introduction of a disturbing element,  tainting their mathematical conceptions with material imagery, and  sapping their faith in the formulae of the textbook?  Besides this, we  have already heard complaints of the undue extension of our studies,  and of the strain put upon our questionists by the weight of learning  which they try to carry with them into the Senate-House.  If we now  ask them to get up their subjects not only by books and writing, but  at the same time by observation and manipulation, will they not break  down altogether?  The Physical Laboratory, we are told, may perhaps be  useful to those who are going out in Natural Science, and who do  not take in Mathematics, but to attempt to combine both kinds of study  during the time of residence at the University is more than one mind  can bear.    No doubt there is some reason for this feeling.  Many of us have  already overcome the initial difficulties of mathematical training.  When we now go on with our study, we feel that it requires exertion  and involves fatigue, but we are confident that if we only work hard  our progress will be certain.    Some of us, on the other hand, may have had some experience of the  routine of experimental work.  As soon as we can read scales, observe  times, focus telescopes, and so on, this kind of work ceases to  require any great mental effort.  We may perhaps tire our eyes and  weary our backs, but we do not greatly fatigue our minds.    It is not till we attempt to bring the theoretical part of our  training into contact with the practical that we begin to experience  the full effect of what Faraday has called \"mental inertia\"--not only  the difficulty of recognising, among the concrete objects before us,  the abstract relation which we have learned from books, but the  distracting pain of wrenching the mind away from the symbols to the  objects, and from the objects back to the symbols.  This however is  the price we have to pay for new ideas.    But when we have overcome these difficulties, and successfully bridged  over the gulph between the abstract and the concrete, it is not a mere  piece of knowledge that we have obtained: we have acquired the  rudiment of a permanent mental endowment.  When, by a repetition of  efforts of this kind, we have more fully developed the scientific  faculty, the exercise of this faculty in detecting scientific  principles in nature, and in directing practice by theory, is no  longer irksome, but becomes an unfailing source of enjoyment, to which  we return so often, that at last even our careless thoughts begin to  run in a scientific channel.    I quite admit that our mental energy is limited in quantity, and I  know that many zealous students try to do more than is good for them.  But the question about the introduction of experimental study is not  entirely one of quantity.  It is to a great extent a question of  distribution of energy.  Some distributions of energy, we know, are  more useful than others, because they are more available for those  purposes which we desire to accomplish.    Now in the case of study, a great part of our fatigue often arises,  not from those mental efforts by which we obtain the mastery of the  subject, but from those which are spent in recalling our wandering  thoughts; and these efforts of attention would be much less fatiguing  if the disturbing force of mental distraction could be removed.    This is the reason why a man whose soul is in his work always makes  more progress than one whose aim is something not immediately  connected with his occupation.  In the latter case the very motive of  which he makes use to stimulate his flagging powers becomes the means  of distracting his mind from the work before him.    There may be some mathematicians who pursue their studies entirely for  their own sake.  Most men, however, think that the chief use of  mathematics is found in the interpretation of nature.  Now a man who  studies a piece of mathematics in order to understand some natural  phenomenon which he has seen, or to calculate the best arrangement of  some experiment which he means to make, is likely to meet with far  less distraction of mind than if his sole aim had been to sharpen his  mind for the successful practice of the Law, or to obtain a high place  in the Mathematical Tripos.    I have known men, who when they were at school, never could see the  good of mathematics, but who, when in after life they made this  discovery, not only became eminent as scientific engineers, but made  considerable progress in the study "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#7)"],[1,"affectedly. \"It was only five minutes before that cursed alarm  bell was sounded in my ears, that I had made up my mind fully to resign  or exchange the instant I could do so with credit to myself; and, I am  sure, to be called out of a warm bed at this unseasonable hour offers  little inducement for me to change my opinion.\"    \"Resign or exchange with credit to yourself!\" sullenly observed a stout  tall officer of about fifty, whose spleen might well be accounted for  in his rank of \"Ensign\" Delme. \"Methinks there can be little credit in  exchanging or resigning, when one's companions are left behind, and in  a post of danger.\"    \"By Jasus, and ye may say that with your own pritty mouth,\" remarked  another veteran, who answered to the name of Lieutenant Murphy; \"for it  isn't now, while we are surrounded and bediviled by the savages, that  any man of the ---- rigimint should be after talking of bating a  retrate.\"    \"I scarcely understand you, gentlemen,\" warmly and quickly retorted Sir  Everard, who, with all his dandyism and effeminacy of manner, was of a  high and resolute spirit. \"Do either of you fancy that I want courage  to face a positive danger, because I may not happen to have any  particular vulgar predilection for early rising?\"    \"Nonsense, Valletort, nonsense,\" interrupted, in accents of almost  feminine sweetness, his friend Lieutenant Charles de Haldimar, the  youngest son of the Governor: \"Murphy is an eternal echo of the  opinions of those who look forward to promotion; and as for Delme--do  you not see the drift of his observation? Should you retire, as you  have threatened, of course another lieutenant will be appointed in your  stead; but, should you chance to lose your scalp during the struggle  with the savages, the step goes in the regiment, and he, being the  senior ensign, obtains promotion in consequence.\"    \"Ah!\" observed Captain Blessington, \"this is indeed the greatest curse  attached to the profession of a soldier. Even among those who most  esteem, and are drawn towards each other as well by fellowship in  pleasure as companionship in danger, this vile and debasing  principle--this insatiable desire for personal advancement--is certain  to intrude itself; since we feel that over the mangled bodies of our  dearest friends and companions, we can alone hope to attain preferment  and distinction.\"    A moment or two of silence ensued, in the course of which each  individual appeared to be bringing home to his own heart the  application of the remark just uttered; and which, however they might  seek to disguise the truth from themselves, was too forcible to find  contradiction from the secret monitor within. And yet of those  assembled there was not one, perhaps, who would not, in the hour of  glory and of danger, have generously interposed his own frame between  that of his companion and the steel or bullet of an enemy. Such are the  contradictory elements which compose a soldier's life.    This conversation, interrupted only by occasional questioning of the  sentinels whom they passed in their circuit, was carried on in an  audible whisper, which the close approximation of the parties to each  other, and the profound stillness of the night, enabled them to hear  with distinctness.    \"Nay, nay, De Haldimar,\" at length observed Sir Everard, in reply to  the observation of his friend, \"do not imagine I intend to gratify Mr.  Delme by any such exhibition as that of a scalpless head; but, if such  be his hope, I trust that the hour which sees my love-locks dangling at  the top of an Indian pole may also let daylight into his own carcass  from a rifle bullet or a tomahawk.\"    \"And yit, Captin, it sames to me,\" observed Lieutenant Murphy, in  allusion to the remark of Blessington rather than in reply to the last  speaker,--\"it sames to me, I say, that promotion in ony way is all fair  and honourable in times of hardship like thase; and though we may drop  a tare over our suparior when the luck of war, in the shape of a  tommyhawk, knocks him over, still there can be no rason why we  shouldn't stip into his shoes the viry nixt instant; and it's that, we  all know, that we fight for. And the divil a bitter chance any man of  us all has of promotion thin yoursilf, Captin: for it'll be mighty  strange if our fat Major doesn't git riddlid like a cullinder through  and through with the bullits from the Ingians' rifles before we have  quite done with this business, and thin you will have the rigimintal  majority, Captin; and it may be that one Liftinint Murphy, who is now  the sanior of his rank, may come in for the vacant captincy.\"    \"And Delme for the lieutenancy,\" said Charles de Haldimar  significantly. \"Well, Murphy, I am happy to find that you, at least,  have hit on another than Sir Everard Valletort: one, in fact, who will  render the promotion more general than it would otherwise have been.  Seriously, I should be sorry if any thing happened to our worthy Major,  who, with all his bustling and grotesque manner, is as good an officer  and as brave a soldier as any his Majesty's army in Canada can boast.  For my part, I say, perish all promotion for ever, if it is only to be  obtained over the dead bodies of those with whom I have lived so long  and shared so many dangers!\"    \"Nobly uttered, Charles,\" said Captain Blessington: \"the sentiment is,  indeed, one well worthy of our present position; and God knows we are  few enough in number already, without looking forward to each other's  death as a means of our own more immediate personal advancement. With  you, therefore, I repeat, perish all my hopes of promotion, if it is  only to be obtained over the corpses of my companions! And let those  who are most sanguine in their expectations beware lest they prove the  first to be cut off, and that even before they have yet enjoyed the  advantages of the promotion they so eagerly covet.\"    This observation, uttered without acrimony, had yet enough of delicate  reproach in it to satisfy Lieutenant Murphy that the speaker was far  from approving the expression of such selfish anticipations at a moment  like the present, when danger, in its most mysterious guise, lurked  around, and threatened the safety of all most dear to them.    The conversation now dropped, and the party pursued their course in  silence. They had just passed the last sentinel posted in their line of  circuit, and were within a few yards of the immediate rear of the  fortress, when a sharp \"Hist!\" and sudden halt of their leader, Captain  Blessington, threw them all into an attitude of the most profound  attention.    \"Did you hear?\" he asked in a subdued whisper, after a few seconds of  silence, in which he had vainly sought to catch a repetition of the  sound.    \"Assuredly,\" he pursued, finding that no one answered, \"I distinctly  heard a human groan.\"    \"Where?--in what direction?\" asked Sir Everard and De Haldimar in the  same breath.    \"Immediately opposite to us on the common. But see, here are the  remainder of the party stationary, and listening also.\"    They now stole gently forward a few paces, and were soon at the side of  their companions, all of whom were straining their necks and bending  their heads in the attitude of men listening attentively.    \"Have you heard any thing, Erskine?\" asked Captain Blessington in the  same low whisper, and addressing the officer who led the opposite party.    \"Not a sound ourselves, but here is Sir Everard's black servant, Sambo,  who has just riveted our attention, by declaring that he distinctly  heard a groan towards the skirt of the common.\"    \"He is right,\" hastily rejoined Blessington; \"I heard it also.\"    Again a death-like silence ensued, during which the eyes of the party  were strained eagerly in the direction of the common. The night was  clear and starry, yet the dark shadow of the broad belt of forest threw  all that part of the waste which came within its immediate range into  impenetrable obscurity.    \"Do you see any thing?\" whispered Valletort to his friend, who stood  next him: \"look--look!\" and he pointed with his finger.    \"Nothing,\" returned De Haldimar, after an anxious gaze of a minute,  \"but that dilapidated old bomb-proof.\"    \"See you not something dark, and slightly moving immediately in a line  with the left angle of the bomb-proof?\"    De Haldimar looked again.--\"I do begin to fancy I see something,\" he  replied; \"but so confusedly and indistinctly, that I know not whether  it be not merely an illusion of my imagination. Perhaps it is a stray  Indian dog devouring the carcass of the wolf you shot yesterday.\"    \"Be it dog or devil, here is for a trial of his vulnerability.--Sambo,  quick, my rifle.\"    The young negro handed to his master one of those long heavy rifles,  which the Indians usually make choice of for killing the buffalo, elk,  and other animals whose wildness renders them difficult of approach. He  then, unbidden, and as if tutored to the task, placed himself in a  stiff upright position in front of his master, with every nerve and  muscle braced to the most inflexible steadiness. The young officer next  threw the rifle on the right shoulder of the boy for a rest, and  prepared to take his aim on the object that had first attracted his  attention.    \"Make haste, massa,--him go directly,--Sambo see him get up.\"    All was breathless attention among the group of officers; and when the  sharp ticking sound produced by the cocking of the rifle of their  companion fell on their ears, they bent their gaze upon the point  towards which the murderous weapon was levelled with the most aching  and intense interest.    \"Quick, quick, massa,--him quite up,\" again whispered the boy.    The words had scarcely passed his lips, when the crack of the rifle,  followed by a bright blaze of light, sounded throughout the stillness  of the night with exciting sharpness. For an instant all was hushed;  but scarcely had the distant"]]]
