THE STUDY OF HISTORY    SUBJECT MATTER OF HISTORY    History is the narrative of what civilized man has done. It deals with  those social groups called states and nations. Just as biography describes  the life of individuals, so history relates the rise, progress, and  decline of human societies.    MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS    History cannot go back of written records. These alone will preserve a  full and accurate account of man's achievements. Manuscripts and books  form one class of written records. The old Babylonians used tablets of  soft clay, on which signs were impressed with a metal instrument. The  tablets were then baked hard in an oven. The Egyptians made a kind of  paper out of the papyrus, a plant native to the Nile valley. The Greeks  and Romans at first used papyrus, but later they employed the more lasting  parchment prepared from sheepskin. Paper seems to have been a Chinese  invention. It was introduced into Europe by the Arabs during the twelfth  century of our era.    [Illustration: THE DISK OF PHAESTUS  Found in 1908 A.D. in the palace at Phaestus, Crete. The disk is of  refined clay on which the figures were stamped in relief with punches.  Both sides of the disk are covered with characters. The side seen in the  illustration contains 31 sign groups (123 signs) separated from one  another by incised lines. The other side contains 30 sign groups (118  signs). The inscription dates from about 1800 B.C.]    [Illustration: A PAPYRUS MANUSCRIPT  The pith of the papyrus, a plant native to the Nile valley, was cut into  slices, which were then pressed together and dried in the sun. Several of  the paper sheets thus formed were glued together at their edges to form a  roll. From _papyros_ and _byblos_, the two Greek names of this plant, have  come our own words, \"paper\" and \"Bible.\" The illustration shows a  manuscript discovered in Egypt in 1890 A.D. It is supposed to be a  treatise, hitherto lost, on the Athenian constitution by the Greek  philosopher Aristotle.]    INSCRIPTIONS AND REMAINS    A second class of written records consists of inscriptions. These are  usually cut in stone, but sometimes we find them painted over the surface  of a wall, stamped on coins, or impressed upon metal tablets. The  historian also makes use of remains, such as statues, ornaments, weapons,  tools, and utensils. Monuments of various sorts, including palaces, tombs,  fortresses, bridges, temples, and churches, form a very important class of  remains.    BEGINNINGS OF HISTORY    History, based on written records, begins in different countries at  varying dates. A few manuscripts and inscriptions found in Egypt date back  three or four thousand years before Christ. The annals of Babylonia are  scarcely less ancient. Trustworthy records in China and India do not  extend beyond 1000 B.C. For the Greeks and Romans the commencement of the  historic period must be placed about 750 B.C. The inhabitants of northern  Europe did not come into the light of history until about the opening of  the Christian era.      2. PREHISTORIC PEOPLES    THE PREHISTORIC PERIOD    In studying the historic period our chief concern is with those peoples  whose ideas or whose deeds have aided human progress and the spread of  civilization. Six-sevenths of the earth's inhabitants now belong to  civilized countries, and these countries include the best and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7965"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#7)"],[1,"seats. There sitteth Varuna attired in  celestial robe, decked in celestial ornaments and jewels, with his  queen, adorned with celestial scents and besmeared with paste of  celestial fragrance. The Adityas wait upon and worship the illustrious  Varuna, the lord of the waters. And Vasuki and Takshaka, and the Naga  called Airavana; Krishna and Lohita; Padma and Chitra endued with great  energy; the Nagas called Kamvala and Aswatara; and Dhritarashtra and  Valahaka; Matimat and Kundadhara and Karkotaka and Dhananjaya; Panimat  and the mighty Kundaka, O lord of the Earth; and Prahlada and  Mushikada, and Janamejaya,--all having auspicious marks and mandalas  and extended hoods;--these and many other snakes, O Yudhishthira,  without anxiety of any kind, wait upon and worship the illustrious  Varuna. And, O king, Vali the son of Virochana, and Naraka the  subjugator of the whole Earth; Sanghraha and Viprachitti, and those  Danavas called Kalakanja; and Suhanu and Durmukha and Sankha and  Sumanas and also Sumati; and Ghatodara, and Mahaparswa, and Karthana  and also Pithara and Viswarupa, Swarupa and Virupa, Mahasiras; and  Dasagriva, Vali, and Meghavasas and Dasavara; Tittiva, and Vitabhuta,  and Sanghrada, and Indratapana--these Daityas and Danavas, all bedecked  with ear-rings and floral wreaths and crowns, and attired in the  celestial robes, all blessed with boons and possessed of great bravery,  and enjoying immortality, and all well of conduct and of excellent  vows, wait upon and worship in that mansion the illustrious Varuna, the  deity bearing the noose as his weapon. And, O king, there are also the  four oceans, the river Bhagirathee, the Kalindi, the Vidisa, the Venwa,  the Narmada of rapid current; the Vipasa, the Satadu, the Chandrabhaga,  the Saraswati; the Iravati, the Vitasta, the Sindhu, the Devanadi; the  Godavari, the Krishnavenwa and that queen of rivers the Kaveri; the  Kimpuna, the Visalya and the river Vaitarani also; the Tritiya, the  Jeshthila, and the great Sone (Soane); the Charmanwati and the great  river Parnasa; the Sarayu, the Varavatya, and that queen of rivers the  Langali, the Karatoya, the Atreyi, the red Mahanada, the Laghanti, the  Gomati, the Sandhya, and also the Trisrotasi--these and other rivers  which are all sacred and are world-renowned places of pilgrimage, as  also other rivers and sacred waters and lakes and wells and springs,  and tanks, large or small, in their personified form, O Bharata, wait  upon and worship the lord Varuna. The points of the heavens, the Earth,  and all the Mountains, as also every species of aquatic animals, all  worship Varuna there. And various tribes of Gandharvas and Apsaras,  devoted to music, both vocal and instrumental, wait upon Varuna,  singing eulogistic hymns unto him. And all those mountains that are  noted for being both delightful and rich in jewels, wait (in their  personified forms) in that Sabha, enjoying sweet converse with one  another. And the chief minister of Varuna, Sunabha by name, surrounded  by his sons and grandsons, also attend upon his master, along with (the  personified form) of a sacred water called go. These all, in their  personified forms, worship the deity. O bull of the Bharata race, such  is the assembly room of Varuna seen by me before, in the course of my  wanderings. Listen now to the account I give of the assembly room of  Kuvera.'      SECTION X    \"Narada said,--'Possessed of great splendour, the assembly house of  Vaisravana, O king, is a hundred yojanas in length and seventy yojanas  in breadth. It was built, O king, by Vaisravana himself using his  ascetic power. Possessing the splendour of the peaks of Kailasa, that  mansion eclipses by its own the brilliance of the Moon himself.  Supported by Guhyakas, that mansion seems to be attached to the  firmament. Of celestial make, it is rendered extremely handsome with  high chambers of gold. Extremely delightful and rendered fragrant with  celestial perfumes, it is variegated with numberless costly jewels.  Resembling the peaks of a mass of white clouds, it seems to be floating  in the air. Painted with colours of celestial gold, it seems to be  decked with streaks of lightning. Within that mansion sitteth on an  excellent seat bright as the sun and covered with celestial carpets and  furnished with a handsome footstool, king Vaisravana of agreeable  person, attired in excellent robes and adorned with costly ornaments  and ear-rings of great brilliance, surrounded by his thousand wives.  Delicious and cooling breezes murmuring through forests of tall  Mandaras, and bearing fragrance of extensive plantations of jasmine, as  also of the lotuses on the bosom of the river Alaka and of the  Nandana-gardens, always minister to the pleasure of the King of the  Yakshas. There the deities with the Gandharvas surrounded by various  tribes of Apsaras, sing in chorus, O king, notes of celestial  sweetness. Misrakesi and Rambha, and Chitrasena, and Suchismita; and  Charunetra, and Gritachi and Menaka, and Punjikasthala; and Viswachi  Sahajanya, and Pramlocha and Urvasi and Ira, and Varga and Sauraveyi,  and Samichi, and Vududa, and Lata--these and a thousand other Apsaras  and Gandharvas, all well-skilled in music and dance, attend upon  Kuvera, the lord of treasures. And that mansion, always filled with the  notes of instrumental and vocal music, as also with the sounds of dance  of various tribes of Gandharvas, and Apsaras hath become extremely  charming and delicious. The Gandharvas called Kinnaras, and others  called Naras, and Manibhadra, and Dhanada, and Swetabhadra and Guhyaka;  Kaseraka, Gandakandu, and the mighty Pradyota; Kustumvuru, Pisacha,  Gajakarna, and Visalaka, Varaha-Karna, Tamraushtica, Falkaksha, and  Falodaka; Hansachuda, Sikhavarta, Vibhishana, Pushpanana, Pingalaka,  Sonitoda and Pravalaka; Vrikshavaspa-niketa, and Chiravasas--these O  Bharata, and many other Yakshas by hundred and thousands always wait  upon Kuvera. The goddess Lakshmi always stayeth there, also Kuvera's  son Nalakuvera. Myself and many others like myself often repair  thither. Many Brahmana Rishis and celestial Rishis also repair there  often. Many Rakshasas, and many Gandharvas, besides those that have  been named, wait upon the worship, in that mansion, the illustrious  lord of all treasures. And, O tiger among kings, the illustrious  husband of Uma and lord of created things, the three-eyed Mahadeva, the  wielder of the trident and the slayer of the Asura called Bhaga-netra,  the mighty god of the fierce bow, surrounded by multitudes of spirits  in their hundreds and thousands, some of dwarfish stature, some of  fierce visage, some hunch-backed, some of blood-red eyes, some of  frightful yells, some feeding upon fat and flesh, and some terrible to  behold, but all armed with various weapons and endued with the speed of  wind, with the goddess (Parvati) ever cheerful and knowing no fatigue,  always waiteth here upon their friend Kuvera, the lord of treasures.  And hundreds of Gandharva chiefs, with cheerful hearts and attired in  their respective robes and Viswavasu, and Haha and Huhu; and Tumvuru  and Parvatta, and Sailusha; and Chitrasena skilled in music and also  Chitraratha,--these and innumerable Gandharvas worship the lord of  treasures. And Chakradhaman, the chief of the Vidyadharas, with his  followers, waiteth in that mansion upon the lord of treasures. And  Kinnaras by hundreds and innumerable kings with Bhagadatta as their  chief, and Druma, the chief of the Kimpurushas, and Mahendra, the chief  of the Rakshasas, and Gandhamadana accompanied by many Yakshas and  Gandharvas and many Rakshasas wait upon the lord of treasures. The  virtuous Vibhishana also worshippeth there his elder brother the lord  Kuvera (Croesus). The mountains of Himavat, Paripatra, Vindhya,  Kailasa, Mandara, Malaya, Durdura, Mahendra, Gandhamadana, Indrakila,  Sunava, and Eastern and the Western hills--these and many other  mountains, in their personified forms, with Meru standing before all,  wait upon and worship the illustrious lord of treasures. The  illustrious Nandiswaras, and Mahakala, and many spirits with arrowy  ears and sharp-pointed mouths, Kaksha, Kuthimukha, Danti, and Vijaya of  great ascetic merit, and the mighty white bull of Siva roaring deep,  all wait in that mansion. Besides these many other Rakshasas and  Pisachas (devils) worship Kuvera in that assembly house. The son of  Pulastya (Kuvera) formerly used always to worship in all the modes and  sit, with permission obtained, beside the god of gods, Siva, the  creator of the three worlds, that supreme Deity surrounded by his  attendants. One day the exalted Bhava (Siva) made friendship with  Kuvera. From that time, O king, Mahadeva always sitteth on the mansion  of his friend, the lord of treasures. Those best of all jewels, those  princes of all gems in the three worlds, viz., Sankha and Padma, in  their personified forms, accompanied by all the jewels of the earth  (also in their personified forms) worship Kuvera.'    \"'This delightful assembly house of Kuvera that I have seen, attached  to the firmament and capable of moving along it, is such, O king.  Listen now to the Sabha I describe unto thee, belonging to Brahma the  Grandsire.'      SECTION XI    \"Narada said,--'Listen to me, O child, as I tell thee of the assembly  house of the Grandsire, that house which none can describe, saying it  is such. In the Krita (golden) age of old, O king, the exalted deity  Aditya (once) came down from heaven into the world of men. Having seen  before the assembly-house of Brahma the Self-created, Aditya was  cheerfully wandering over the Earth in human form, desirous of  beholding what could be seen here. It was on that occasion, O son of  Pandu, that the god of day spoke unto me, O bull of the Bharata race,  of that celestial Sabha (assembly) of the Grandsire, immeasurable and  immaterial and indescribable, as regards"]]]
