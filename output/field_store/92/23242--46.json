[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#7)"],[1," Court?         MAR.  Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?         MAR. and GIU.  We want our tea.         ANNI.  I think we may make an interim order for double    rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to    indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?         GIOR.  That, I think, will meet the case.  But you must work    hardstick to itnothing like work.         GIU.  Oh, certainly.  We quite understand that a man who    holds the magnificent position of King should do something to    justify it.  We are called \"Your Majesty\"; we are allowed to buy    ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us    in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we    enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists    to all the principal charities.  In return for these advantages    the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.                       SONGGIUSEPPE with CHORUS.      Rising early in the morning,         We proceed to light the fire,    Then our Majesty adorning         In its workaday attire,              We embark without delay              On the duties of the day.      First, we polish off some batches    Of political despatches,         And foreign politicians circumvent;    Then, if business isn't heavy,    We may hold a Royal levee,         Or ratify some Acts of Parliament.         Then we probably review the household troops         With the usual \"Shalloo humps!\" and \"Shalloo hoops!\"         Or receive with ceremonial and state    An interesting Eastern potentate.         After that we generally         Go and dress our private valet         (It's a rather nervous dutyhe's a touchy little man)         Write some letters literary         For our private secretary         He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.         Then, in view of cravings inner,         We go down and order dinner;         Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate         Spend an hour in titivating         All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;         Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.           Oh, philosophers may sing         Of the troubles of a King;         Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;         But the privilege and pleasure         That we treasure beyond measure         Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State.      CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.      After luncheon (making merry    On a bun and glass of sherry),         If we've nothing in particular to do,    We may make a Proclamation,    Or receive a deputation         Then we possibly create a Peer or two.    Then we help a fellow-creature on his path    With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath,    Or we dress and toddle off in semi-state    To a festival, a function, or a fete.         Then we go and stand as sentry         At the Palace (private entry),         Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and    fro,         While the warrior on duty         Goes in search of beer and beauty         (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).         He relieves us, if he's able,         Just in time to lay the table,         Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve    or one,         With a pleasure that's emphatic,         We retire to our attic         With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!           Oh, philosophers may sing         Of the troubles of a King,         But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are    none;         And the culminating pleasure         That we treasure beyond measure         Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!      CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.                                           (Exeunt all but Marco and    Giuseppe.)           GIU.  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence.  They're    all so singularly kind and considerate.  You don't find them    wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying \"It's my    turn now.\"  No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and    never seem to grudge it.         MAR.  It makes one feel quite selfish.  It almost seems like    taking advantage of their good nature.         GIU.  How nice they were about the double rations.         MAR.  Most considerate.  Ah! there's only one thing wanting    to make us thoroughly comfortable.         GIU.  And that is?         MAR.  The dear little wives we left behind us three months    ago.         GIU.  Yes, it is dull without female society.  We can do    without everything else, but we can't do without that.         MAR.  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything.    There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.                                SONGMARCO.                     Take a pair of sparkling eyes,                        Hidden, ever and anon,                             In a merciful eclipse                   Do not heed their mild surprise                        Having passed the Rubicon,                             Take a pair of rosy lips;                   Take a figure trimly planned                        Such as admiration whets                             (Be particular in this);                   Take a tender little hand,                        Fringed with dainty fingerettes,                             Press itin parenthesis;                   Ah! Take all these, you lucky man                   Take and keep them, if you can!                     Take a pretty little cot                        Quite a miniature affair                             Hung about with trellised vine,                   Furnish it upon the spot                        With the treasures rich and rare                             I've endeavoured to define.                   Live to love and love to live                        You will ripen at your ease,                             Growing on the sunny side                   Fate has nothing more to give.                        You're a dainty man to please                             If you are not satisfied.                   Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;                   Act upon it, if you can!      (Enter Chorus of Contadine, running in, led by Fiametta and    Vittoria.  They are met by all the Ex-Gondoliers, who welcome    them heartily.)              SCENECHORUS OF GIRLS, QUARTET, DUET and CHORUS.                Here we are, at the risk of our lives,              From ever so far, and we've brought your wives              And to that end we've crossed the main,              And don't intend to return again!      FIA.           Though obedience is strong,                        Curiosity's stronger                   We waited for long,                        Till we couldn't wait longer.      VIT.           It's imprudent, we know,                        But without your society                   Existence was slow,                        And we wanted variety      BOTH.     Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.      ALL.      So here we are, at the risk of our lives,              From ever so far, and we've brought your wives              And to that end we've crossed the main,              And don't intend to return again!      (Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and    Giuseppe.)      GIU.      Tessa!    TESS.          Giuseppe!      {All embrace.}    GIA.      Marco!    MAR.           Gianetta!                             TESSA and GIANETTA.      TESS.          After sailing to this island    GIA.                Tossing in a manner frightful,    TESS.          We are all once more on dry land    GIA.                And we find the change delightful,    TESS.          As at home we've been remaining                        We've not seen you both for ages,    GIA.           Tell me, are you fond of reigning?                        How's the food, and what's the wages?    TESS.          Does your new employment please ye?    GIA.                How does Royalizing strike you?    TESS.          Is it difficult or easy?    GIA.                Do you think your subjects like you?    TESS.          I am anxious to elicit,                        Is it plain and easy steering?    GIA.           Take it altogether, is it                        Better fun than gondoliering?    BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting                        Till you tell us, never doubt it;                   Everything is interesting,                        Tell us, tell us all about it!      CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.      TESS.          Is the populace exacting?    GIA.                Do they keep you at a distance?    TESS.          All unaided are you acting,    GIA.                Or do they provide assistance?    TESS.          When you're busy, have you got to                        Get up early in the morning?    GIA.           If you do what you ought not to,                        Do they give the usual warning?    TESS.          With a horse do they equip you?    GIA.                Lots of trumpeting and drumming?    TESS.          Do the Royal tradesmen tip you?    GIA.                Ain't the livery becoming!    TESS.          Does your human being inner                        Feed on everything that nice is?    GIA.           Do they give you wine for dinner;                        Peaches, sugar-plums, and ices?    BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting                        Till you tell us, never doubt it;                   Everything is interesting,                        Tell us, tell us all about it!      CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.           MAR.  This is indeed a most delightful surprise!         TESS.  Yes, we thought you'd like it.  You see, it was like    this.  After you left we felt very dull and mopey, and the days    crawled by, and you never wrote; so at last I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8102"],[0,"The Forme of Cury: A Roll of Ancient English Cookery Compiled, about A.D. 1390 (#7)"],[1,"with porpeys . . . . . . . . . .

This Saxon letter with the power of _th_, is used almost      perpetually  in our Roll and the Editor's Ms. Every one may not have      adverted to it; but this character is the ground of our present      abbreviations y'e the, y't that, y's this, &c. the y in these cases      being evidently only an altered and more modern way of writing þ.  [5] vyaund. This word is to be understood in the concrete, _quasi_      vyander, a curious epicure, an _Apicius_. V. Preface.  [6] csten ynges. Christian kings. _K_ being to be inserted afterwards      (v. note [1] and [3]) in red ink. Chaucer, v. christen.  [7] and. Read _of_.  [8] Phisik. V. Preface.  [9] Sotiltees.

Hence our _ensue_ written       formerly _ensew_. Skelton, p. 144; and _ensiew_, Ames Typ. Ant. p. 9.  [12] F is omitted for the reason given in note 1.  [13] No. XX.II. II. is omitted.
