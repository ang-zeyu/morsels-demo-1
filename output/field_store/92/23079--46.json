[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#7)"],[1," had traveled at night. He was, for the  time, unafraid of anything that might creep up on him out of the  darkness. The blackest shadows had lost their terror. It was the first  big fight between the two natures that were born in him--the wolf and  the dog--and the dog was vanquished. Now and then he stopped to lick  his wound, and as he licked it he growled, as though for the hurt  itself he held a personal antagonism. If Pierrot could have seen and  heard, he would have understood very quickly, and he would have said:  \"Let him die. The club will never take that devil out of him.\"    In this humor Baree came, an hour later, out of the heavy timber of the  creek bottom into the more open spaces of a small plain that ran along  the foot of a ridge. It was in this plain that Oohoomisew hunted.  Oohoomisew was a huge snow owl. He was the patriarch among all the owls  of Pierrot's trapping domain. He was so old that he was almost blind,  and therefore he never hunted as other owls hunted. He did not hide  himself in the black cover of spruce and balsam tops, or float softly  through the night, ready in an instant to swoop down upon his prey. His  eyesight was so poor that from a spruce top he could not have seen a  rabbit at all, and he might have mistaken a fox for a mouse.    So old Oohoomisew, learning wisdom from experience, hunted from ambush.  He would squat on the ground, and for hours at a time he would remain  there without making a sound and scarcely moving a feather, waiting  with the patience of Job for something to eat to come his way. Now and  then he had made mistakes. Twice he had mistaken a lynx for a rabbit,  and in the second attack he had lost a foot, so that when he slumbered  aloft during the day he clung to his perch with one claw. Crippled,  nearly blind, and so old that he had long ago lost the tufts of  feathers over his ears, he was still a giant in strength, and when he  was angry, one could hear the snap of his beak twenty yards away.    For three nights he had been unlucky, and tonight he had been  particularly unfortunate. Two rabbits had come his way, and he had  lunged at each of them from his cover. The first he had missed  entirely; the second had left with him a mouthful of fur--and that was  all. He was ravenously hungry, and he was gritting his bill in his bad  temper when he heard Baree approaching.    Even if Baree could have seen under the dark bush ahead, and had  discovered Oohoomisew ready to dart from his ambush, it is not likely  that he would have gone very far aside. His own fighting blood was up.  He, too, was ready for war.    Very indistinctly Oohoomisew saw him at last, coming across the little  open space which he was watching. He squatted down. His feathers  ruffled up until he was like a ball. His almost sightless eyes glowed  like two bluish pools of fire. Ten feet away, Baree stopped for a  moment and licked his wound. Oohoomisew waited cautiously. Again Baree  advanced, passing within six feet of the bush. With a swift hop and a  sudden thunder of his powerful wings the great owl was upon him.    This time Baree let out no cry of pain or of fright. The wolf is  kipichi-mao, as the Indians say. No hunter ever heard a trapped wolf  whine for mercy at the sting of a bullet or the beat of a club. He dies  with his fangs bared. Tonight it was a wolf whelp that Oohoomisew was  attacking, and not a dog pup. The owl's first rush keeled Baree over,  and for a moment he was smothered under the huge, outspread wings,  while Oohoomisew--pinioning him down--hopped for a claw hold with his  one good foot, and struck fiercely with his beak.    One blow of that beak anywhere about the head would have settled for a  rabbit, but at the first thrust Oohoomisew discovered that it was not a  rabbit he was holding under his wings. A bloodcurdling snarl answered  the blow, and Oohoomisew remembered the lynx, his lost foot, and his  narrow escape with his life. The old pirate might have beaten a  retreat, but Baree was no longer the puppyish Baree of that hour in  which he had fought young Papayuchisew. Experience and hardship had  aged and strengthened him. His jaws had passed quickly from the  bone-licking to the bone-cracking age--and before Oohoomisew could get  away, if he was thinking of flight at all, Baree's fangs closed with a  vicious snap on his one good leg.    In the stillness of night there rose a still greater thunder of wings,  and for a few moments Baree closed his eyes to keep from being blinded  by Oohoomisew's furious blows. But he hung on grimly, and as his teeth  met through the flesh of the old night-pirate's leg, his angry snarl  carried defiance to Oohoomisew's ears. Rare good fortune had given him  that grip on the leg, and Baree knew that triumph or defeat depended on  his ability to hold it. The old owl had no other claw to sink into him,  and it was impossible--caught as he was--for him to tear at Baree with  his beak. So he continued to beat that thunder of blows with his  four-foot wings.    The wings made a great tumult about Baree, but they did not hurt him.  He buried his fangs deeper. His snarls rose more fiercely as he got the  taste of Oohoomisew's blood, and through him there surged more hotly  the desire to kill this monster of the night, as though in the death of  this creature he had the opportunity of avenging himself for all the  hurts and hardships that had befallen him since he had lost his mother.    Oohoomisew had never felt a great fear until now. The lynx had snapped  at him but once--and was gone, leaving him crippled. But the lynx had  not snarled in that wolfish way, and it had not hung on. A thousand and  one nights Oohoomisew had listened to the wolf howl. Instinct had told  him what it meant. He had seen the packs pass swiftly through the  night, and always when they passed he had kept in the deepest shadows.  To him, as for all other wild things, the wolf howl stood for death.  But until now, with Baree's fangs buried in his leg, he had never  sensed fully the wolf fear. It had taken it years to enter into his  slow, stupid head--but now that it was there, it possessed him as no  other thing had ever possessed him in all his life.    Suddenly Oohoomisew ceased his beating and launched himself upward.  Like huge fans his powerful wings churned the air, and Baree felt  himself lifted suddenly from the earth. Still he held on--and in a  moment both bird and beast fell back with a thud.    Oohoomisew tried again. This time he was more successful, and he rose  fully six feet into the air with Baree. They fell again. A third time  the old outlaw fought to wing himself free of Baree's grip; and then,  exhausted, he lay with his giant wings outspread, hissing and cracking  his bill.    Under those wings Baree's mind worked with the swift instincts of the  killer. Suddenly he changed his hold, burying his fangs into the under  part of Oohoomisew's body. They sank into three inches of feathers.  Swift as Baree had been, Oohoomisew was equally swift to take advantage  of his opportunity. In an instant he had swooped upward. There was a  jerk, a rending of feathers from flesh--and Baree was alone on the  field of battle.    Baree had not killed, but he had conquered. His first great day--or  night--had come. The world was filled with a new promise for him, as  vast as the night itself. And after a moment he sat back on his  haunches, sniffing the air for his beaten enemy. Then, as if defying  the feathered monster to come back and fight to the end, he pointed his  sharp little muzzle up to the stars and sent forth his first babyish  wolf howl into the night.        CHAPTER 6    Baree's fight with Oohoomisew was good medicine for him. It not only  gave him great confidence in himself, but it also cleared the fever of  ugliness from his blood. He no longer snapped and snarled at things as  he went on through the night.    It was a wonderful night. The moon was straight overhead, and the sky  was filled with stars, so that in the open spaces the light was almost  like that of day, except that it was softer and more beautiful. It was  very still. There was no wind in the treetops, and it seemed to Baree  that the howl he had given must have echoed to the end of the world.    Now and then Baree heard a sound--and always he stopped, attentive and  listening. Far away he heard the long, soft mooing of a cow moose. He  heard a great splashing in the water of a small lake that he came to,  and once there came to him the sharp cracking of horn against horn--two  bucks settling a little difference of opinion a quarter of a mile away.  But it was always the wolf howl that made him sit and listen longest,  his heart beating with a strange impulse which he did not as yet  understand. It was the call of his breed, growing in him slowly but  insistently.    He was still a wanderer--pupamootao, the Indians call it. It is this  \"wander spirit\" that inspires for a time nearly every creature of the  wild as soon as it is able to care for itself--nature's scheme,  perhaps, for doing away with too close family relations and possibly  dangerous interbreeding. Baree, like the young wolf seeking new hunting  grounds, or the young fox discovering a new world, had no reason or  method in his wandering. He was simply \"traveling\"--going on. He wanted  something which he could not find. The wolf call brought it to him.    The stars and the moon filled Baree with a yearning for this something.  The distant sounds impinged upon him his great aloneness. And instinct  told him that only by questing could he find. It was not so much Kazan  and Gray Wolf that he missed now--not so much motherhood and home as it  was companionship. Now that he had fought the wolfish rage out of him  in his battle with Oohoomisew, the dog part of him had come into its  own again--the lovable half of him, the part that wanted to snuggle up  near something that was alive and friendly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#7)"],[1,"of those in the country. During one short mission  which Brother Hyde and I took into the country, after preaching five  discourses on the principles of our holy religion, we had the pleasure  of immersing one hundred and thirty in the waters of baptism.    Thus mightily ran the word of God and prospered to the joy and comfort  of His servants, and to the salvation of precious and immortal souls;  while the world was struck with amazement and surprise at the things  which they saw and heard. During this state of things, our enemies were  not idle, but heaped abuse upon us with an unsparing hand, and issued  torrents of lies after us, which, however, I am thankful to say, did  not sweep us away.    Among those most active in publishing falsehoods against us and the  truth, were many of the reverend clergy, who were afraid to meet us  face to face in honorable debate, although particularly requested so  to do, but sought every opportunity to destroy our characters, and  propagate their lies concerning us, thus giving testimony that \"they  loved darkness rather than light.\"    Although we frequently called upon the ministers of the different  denominations, who had taken a stand against us, to come forward  and investigate the subject of our religion before the world in an  honorable manner, and bring forth their strong reasons to disprove  the things we taught, and convince the people by sound argument and  the word of God, if they could, that we did not preach the gospel of  Christ, they altogether declined.    This course we felt moved upon by the Spirit to adopt; but they kept  at a respectful distance, and only came out when we were absent, with  misrepresentations and abuse. It is true we suffered some from the  statements which they thought proper to make, when we could get no  opportunity to contradict them; but generally their reports were of  such a character that they carried along with them their own refutation.    The time when we expected to return to our native land, having now  nearly arrived, it was thought necessary to spend the short time we  had to remain in that country in visiting and organizing the churches;  placing such officers over them, and giving such instructions as would  be beneficial to them during our absence. Accordingly, Brothers Hyde,  Fielding and I entered upon this duty, and we visited a Church nearly  every day, and imparted such instructions as the Spirit directed.  We first visited the Churches south of Preston, and after spending  some time in that direction we journeyed to the north, accompanied by  Brother Richards, who had just returned from the city of Bedford.    While we were attending to our duties in that section, we received a  very pressing invitation from a Baptist church, through the medium  of their deacon, to pay them a visit, stating that the society was  exceedingly anxious to hear from our own lips, the wonderful things we  had proclaimed in the regions round about.    We endeavored to excuse ourselves from going, as our engagements  already were such that it would require the short time we had to stay  to attend to them. But they seemed determined to take no denial, and  plead with us with such earnestness that we could not resist their  entreaties, and finally we consented to go and preach once.    Having arrived at the place, we found a large congregation already  assembled in the Baptist chapel, anxiously awaiting our arrival. The  minister gave out the hymns for us, and Elder Hyde spoke on the subject  of the resurrection with great effect; after which the minister gave  out another hymn which was sung by the assembly, and then he requested  me to address them. I arose and spoke briefly on the first principles  of the gospel.    During the services the congregation were overjoyed, the tears ran  down their cheeks, and the minister could not refrain from frequently  clapping his hands together for joy while in the meeting. After  the service was over he took us to his house, where we were very  kindly entertained. After partaking of his hospitality he with some  more friends, accompanied us to our lodgings, where we remained in  conversation until a very late hour.    The next morning while we were preparing to depart we were waited upon  by several of the citizens, who requested us to preach again that day,  stating that great interest was felt by the inhabitants, many of whom  were in tears, fearing they should hear us no more; and that a number  of influential men, had suspended operations in their factories, to  allow their workmen the privilege of hearing us preach. But we were  obliged to deny them, as it was necessary to attend to the appointments  we had previously made. We could scarcely tear ourselves away from  them, and when we did so they wept like little children. Such a desire  to hear the gospel, I never saw equalled before.    After commending them to the grace and mercy of God, we went to  Downham, where we preached in the afternoon, after which forty came  forward and were baptized. In the evening we called the churches of  Chatburn and Downham together, and after confirming forty-five who had  previously been baptized, we appointed priests, teachers and deacons to  preside over them.        CHAPTER VI.    IMPRESSED TO VISIT DOWNHAM AND CHATBURN--BAD CHARACTER OF THOSE  PLACES--WARNED AGAINST GOING--JOY WITH WHICH THE GOSPEL WAS  RECEIVED--THE PEOPLE EAGER TO BE BAPTIZED--LOTH TO PART WITH ME--VAIN  OPPOSITION FROM A MINISTER--AFFECTING CONDUCT OF LITTLE CHILDREN.    There being something interesting in the establishing of the gospel  in Downham and Chatburn, I will relate the circumstances of my visit  to those places, and the prospect we had of success prior to our  proclaiming the truth to them.    Having been preaching in the neighborhood of these villages, I felt it  my duty to pay them a visit and tell them my mission. I mentioned my  desires to several of the brethren, but they endeavored to dissuade me  from going, informing me that there could be no prospect of success, as  several ministers of different denominations had endeavored to raise  churches in these places, and had frequently preached to them, but to  no effect. They had resisted all the efforts and withstood the attempts  of all sects and parties for thirty years, and the preachers had given  them up to the hardness of their hearts. I was also informed that they  were very wicked places and the inhabitants were hardened against the  gospel.    However, this did not discourage me in the least, believing that the  gospel of Jesus Christ could reach the heart when the gospels of men  were found abortive. I consequently told those who tried to dissuade me  from going that these were the places I wanted to go to, and that it  was my business \"not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"    Accordingly I went in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I soon  procured a large barn to preach in, which was crowded to excess. Having  taken my stand in the middle of the congregation so that all might be  able to hear, I commenced my discourse, spoke with great simplicity  on the subject of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,  the conditions of pardon for a fallen world, and the privileges and  blessings of all those who embraced the truth. I likewise said a little  on the subject of the resurrection.    My remarks were accompanied by the spirit of the Lord and were received  with joy, and these people, who were represented as being so hard and  obdurate, were melted with tenderness and love, and such a feeling was  produced as I never saw before; and the effect seemed to be general.    I then told them that, being a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, I  stood ready at all times to administer the ordinances of the gospel.  After I had concluded, I felt some one pulling at my coat. I turned  around and asked the person what it was he desired. The answer was  \"Please, sir, will you baptize me?\" \"and me!\" \"and me!\" exclaimed more  than a dozen voices.    We accordingly went down into the water, and before I left, I baptized  twenty-five for the remission of sins--and was thus engaged until four  o'clock the next morning.    Another evening the congregation was so numerous that I had to preach  in the open air, and took my stand on a stone wall, and afterwards  baptized a number.    These towns seemed to be affected from one end to the other; parents  called their children together, spoke to them of the subjects upon  which I had preached, and warned them against swearing and all other  evil practices, and instructed them in their duty, etc. Such a scene  I presume was never witnessed in this place before; the hearts of the  people appeared to be broken, and the next morning they were all in  tears, thinking they should see my face no more. When I left them my  feelings were such as I cannot describe. As I walked down the street,  followed by numbers, the doors were crowded by the inmates of the  houses, waiting to bid us a last farewell, who could only give vent to  their grief in sobs and broken accents.    While contemplating this scene we were induced to take off our hats,  for we felt as if the place was holy ground. The Spirit of the Lord  rested down upon us, and I was constrained to bless that whole region  of country.    We were followed a considerable distance from the villages by a great  number, who could hardly separate themselves from us. My heart was like  unto theirs, and I almost thought my head was a fountain of tears, for  I wept for several miles after I bid them adieu.    Some things transpired while I was in England which may be considered  of but little importance by the world, but which will no doubt be  appreciated by the Saints, who can not only mark the providence of God  as displayed in nations and kingdoms, but can observe its workings in  private life, and in affairs of but apparent small moment.    Soon after our "]]]
