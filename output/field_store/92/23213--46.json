You would have the power of executing ill doers in accordance  with the custom of your country; but the murder of a person who had  committed no crime whatever is not to be permitted, and anything like  wholesale cruelty and tyranny would be sternly repressed.\"    For some time the rajah sat without speaking; then he said, with an  evident effort of self control, \"I must think all this over; it is all  new to me.\"    \"By all means do so,\" the captain replied. \"The matter is an important  one, and you will do well to consider it in all lights before you take a  step that, once taken, cannot be undone.\"    \"I don't like the fellow's looks, Doctor,\" the captain said; \"he  intended to use us as a cat's paw against his neighbors.\"    \"I think that he is a thoroughly bad lot, sir; and if he accepted the  terms, I should be very sorry to be appointed Resident, for I should not  feel that my life was worth a day's purchase.\"    \"Well, there is nothing to do but to wait until we get a definite answer  from him; and my instructions are that, if I find that he is not a  desirable man to have to deal with, I am to enter into negotiations with  other rajahs, and to endeavor to do something to open the trade of  the river and to render it safe for merchants who come up to trade. If  Hassan's account of this man's doings is correct, he is the main cause  of the falling off in the trade, and, moreover, the author of the  piracies of which we have had so many complaints; indeed, it is possible  that when the Governor learns the true state of things, I may get an  order to present an ultimatum to this fellow and to sink his piratical  craft. At any rate, we may make up our minds to be here for some time.\"    On the following day a message was received from the rajah, saying that  if any of the officers wished to go on excursions for sport, guides  would be placed at their disposal, and that all who wished to do so  could at any time travel through the country without the slightest fear  of molestation. For some time affairs remained in the same condition.  The doctor went daily on shore with butterfly and beetle nets, tin  boxes, and other paraphernalia. He was generally accompanied by a couple  of bluejackets, and always took a native guide to prevent the risk of  being lost in the jungle, and also because the man was able to take him  to places where villages had stood, and it was in these clearings that  insect life, especially among the lepidoptera, was most abundant. The  Malay he first engaged was a young fellow who proved so intelligent and  willing that he was permanently retained for the service as long as the  Serpent remained on the station.    The officers obtained no sport with big game; for although at night  the forest was full of sounds, showing the number of wild animals that  abounded, these never were met with during the daytime, and it would  have been hopeless endeavoring to penetrate the thick jungle in search  of them. There was, however, an abundance of birds, for the most part  of brilliant plumage, and the doctor was delighted with the spoils they  brought in, while the messes were kept well supplied with jungle fowl  and other edible birds. The natives, learning from the guide of the  doctor's passion for insects, brought in large numbers for sale, and he  was able to purchase a great many specimens altogether new to science.    The two midshipmen made excursions with their guns whenever they could  get leave. Davis and two other sailors always accompanied them, as the  captain's orders were strict that no officer or man should go outside  the limits of the campong unless accompanied by two armed seamen.    Sometimes they took a native canoe and went up the river fishing; but as  an abundance of fish could be caught by lines from the ship's side, they  only did this as a change, and often in the cool of the evening they lay  lazily in the canoe, while the fishermen were employed rowing them up  one or other of the numerous streams which flowed into the river.  The doctor's prognostications as to the health of the crew were only  partially verified, for the precautions taken, if they did not secure a  perfect immunity against fever, at least greatly diminished the number  of those who suffered from it. The abundance of fish either caught from  the ship or purchased from the natives formed a wholesome diet, aided  by the fruit, of which the natives brought off a very large quantity.  It was very varied, and much of it delicious; the mangosteens were  specially appreciated, and those who could overcome their repugnance to  the disgusting odor of the durians found them delicious eating. Besides  these were custard apples, bananas, and many other kinds of fruit;  all were very cheap and, upon the doctor's suggestion, a supply was  purchased daily for the use of the ship's company, and the sailors, who  had no other use for their money, laid out no small portion of their pay  on these luxuries.    The captain had taken every opportunity, when boats passed up the river,  to send messages and presents to the chiefs of the tribes higher up,  with assurances that he had not come up as an enemy, but that he desired  to be on good terms with all, and would gladly see any of them who would  come down to pay him a visit, and would guarantee their safe return  without molestation on the part of Sehi. No answers had, however, been  received to these overtures, and a proposal he made to the rajah to  send some of the ship's boats up the river to endeavor to bring about  an understanding between him and his neighbors was received with extreme  disfavor.        CHAPTER V.      So far, nothing had been seen of the rajah's prahus. When questioned on  the subject, he replied that they were all down on the coast, trading  with the natives; but it was so improbable that they should have been  sent away while the rajah was in fear of an attack by his neighbors that  no credence was given to the assertion. The ship's boats often went out  for long rows on the river, ostensibly--as the captain told the rajah,  who inquired suspiciously as to the meaning of these excursions--for the  sake of giving the crews active exercise, but principally in order to  take soundings of the river, and to investigate the size and positions  of the creeks running into it. One day the gig and cutter had proceeded  farther than usual; they had started at daybreak, and had turned off  into what seemed a very small creek, that had hitherto been unexplored,  as from the width of its mouth it was supposed to extend but a short  distance into the forest. The master's mate was in command of one boat,  the second lieutenant of the other; Harry Parkhurst accompanied the  latter. After pushing through the screen of foliage that almost closed  the entrance to the creek, the boats rowed on for some distance. For  half a mile the width was but some fifteen yards, and the trees met in  an arch overhead, then it widened considerably.    \"This is just the sort of place,\" the lieutenant said to Harry,  \"where the rajah's prahus may be hidden away. We had best go along as  noiselessly as possible. If we were to come upon them suddenly they  might fire upon us, and that would bring on a general row. If we should  catch sight of them, it would be best to take the news to the captain,  and let him act as he thinks fit.\"    He ordered the men to cease rowing until the gig came alongside.    \"Mr. Morrison,\" he said, \"it seems to me that this is a likely place for  the prahus to be hidden. We had better try and discover if this is the  case, without being ourselves seen; therefore have all the oars, except  four, laid in, and let the men muffle those with their stockings, and  be most careful to dip them into the water without making a splash.  Let absolute silence be preserved in the boat. I will lead the way as  before, and if I hold up my hand stop rowing instantly.\"    \"Aye, aye, sir!\" the mate replied.    The same precautions were taken by the cutter, and the boats proceeded  noiselessly. Presently the stream narrowed again, until it seemed that  they were approaching its termination, and the boat stopped rowing.    \"I fancy we have come to the end of it, Mr. Morrison,\" the lieutenant  said in a low voice.    \"I am afraid so too, sir; there is no room for the oars, and we shall  either have to punt the boats, or to drag them by the bushes.\"    The lieutenant was about to give the order to turn when Harry said,  suddenly, \"There is a current, sir. I have had my eye upon that root,  and we have drifted backwards a couple of feet since we lost way, so  there must be a stretch of water above us.\"    The lieutenant watched the root of the tree to which Harry had pointed,  for a minute in silence, then he said, \"You are right, my lad, there is  a current, and, as you say, there must be a stretch of water above us.  Lay in your oars, lads; stand up, and pull her along by the boughs and  bushes, but don't make the slightest sound.\"    Twenty yards farther the creek widened, and the oars were again got out.    \"Take your place in the bow, Mr. Parkhurst, and hold up your hand the  instant you see anything unusual, and do you, men, be ready to hold her  up the instant I give the order.\"    They proceeded for a quarter of a mile, the gig following close behind.  Suddenly, at a bend in the stream, a glare of light was seen ahead.  Harry held up his hand, and passed the word down in a whisper that just  ahead the creek widened into a broad sheet of water. The lieutenant  stopped the gig by holding up his hand, passed the order for the men  to lay in their oars noiselessly, and told the coxswain to keep in well  under the bushes on the left hand side;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#7)"],[1,"ges,  should have had him as a favoured summer guest. Creeper and nuthatch,  and starling and gem-like blue tit, found holes enough in the old trunks  to breed in. And yet I knew that, albeit not common, he was there; I  could not exactly say where, but somewhere on the other side of the next  hedge or field or orchard; for I heard his unmistakable cry, now on this  hand, now on that. Day after day I followed the voice, sometimes in my  eagerness forcing my way through a brambly hedge to emerge with  scratched hands and clothes torn, like one that had been set upon and  mauled by some savage animal of the cat kind; and still the quaint  figure eluded my vision.    At last I began to have doubts about the creature that emitted that  strange, penetrating call. First heard as a bird-call, and nothing more,  by degrees it grew more and more laugh-like--a long, far-reaching,  ringing laugh; not the laugh I should like to hear from any person I  take an interest in, but a laugh with all the gladness, unction, and  humanity gone out of it--a dry mechanical sound, as if a soulless,  lifeless, wind-instrument had laughed. It was very curious. Listening to  it day by day, something of the strange history of the being once but no  longer human, that uttered it grew up and took shape in my mind; for we  all have in us something of this mysterious faculty. It was no bird, no  wryneck, but a being that once, long, long, long ago, in that same  beautiful place, had been a village boy--a free, careless, glad-hearted  boy, like many another. But to this boy life was more than to others,  since nature appeared immeasurably more vivid on account of his brighter  senses; therefore his love of life and happiness in life greatly  surpassed theirs. Annually the trees shed their leaves, the flowers  perished, the birds flew away to some distant country beyond the  horizon, and the sun grew pale and cold in the sky; but the bright  impression all things made on him gave him a joy that was perennial. The  briony, woodbine, and honeysuckle he had looked on withered in the  hedges, but their presentments flourished untouched by frost, as if his  warmth sustained and gave them perpetual life; in that inner magical  world of memory the birds still twittered and warbled, each after its  kind, and the sun shone everlastingly. But he was living in a fool's  paradise, as he discovered by-and-by, when a boy who had been his  playmate began to grow thin and pale, and at last fell sick and died. He  crept near and watched his dead companion lying motionless, unbreathing,  with a face that was like white clay; and then, more horrible still, he  saw him taken out and put into a grave, and the heavy, cold soil cast  over him.    What did this strange and terrible thing mean? Now for the first time he  was told that life is ours only for a season; that we also, like the  leaves and flowers, flourish for a while then fade and perish, and  mingle with the dust. The sad knowledge had come too suddenly and in too  vivid and dreadful a manner.  He could not endure it. Only for a  season!--only for a season! The earth would be green, and the sky blue,  and the sun shine bright for ever, and he would not see, not know it!  Struck with anguish at the thought, he stole away out of sight of the  others to hide himself in woods and thickets, to brood alone on such a  hateful destiny, and torture himself with vain longings, until he, too,  grew pale and thin and large-eyed, like the boy that had died, and those  who saw him shook their heads and whispered to one another that he was  not long for this world. He knew what they were saying, and it only  served to increase his misery and fear, and made him hate them because  they were insensible to the awful fact that death awaited them, or so  little concerned that they had never taken the trouble to inform him of  it. To eat and drink and sleep was all they cared for, and they regarded  death with indifference, because their dull sight did not recognize the  beauty and glory of the earth, nor their dull hearts respond to Nature's  everlasting gladness. The sight of the villagers, with their solemn  head-shakings and whisperings, even of his nearest kindred, grew  insupportable, and he at length disappeared from among them, and was  seen no more with his white, terror-stricken face. From that time he hid  himself in the close thickets, supporting his miserable existence on  wild fruits and leaves, and spending many hours each day lying in some  sheltered spot, gazing up into that blue sunny sky, which was his to  gaze on only for a season, while the large tears gathered in his eyes  and rolled unheeded down his wasted cheeks.    At length during this period there occurred an event which is the  obscurest part of his history; for I know not who or what it was--my  mind being in a mist about it--that came to or accidentally found him  lying on a bed of grass and dried leaves in his thorny hiding-place. It  may have been a gipsy or a witch--there were witches in those days--who,  suddenly looking on his upturned face and seeing the hunger in his  unfathomable eyes, loved him, in spite of her malignant nature; or a  spirit out of the earth; or only a very wise man, an ancient,  white-haired solitary, whose life had been spent in finding out the  secrets of nature. This being, becoming acquainted with the cause of the  boy's grief and of his solitary, miserable condition, began to comfort  him by telling him that no grief was incurable, no desire that heart  could conceive unattainable. He discoursed of the hidden potent  properties of nature, unknown only to those who seek not to know them;  of the splendid virtue inherent in all things, like the green and violet  flames in the clear colourless raindrops which are seen only on rare  occasions. Of life and death, he said that life was of the spirit which  never dies, that death meant only a passage, a change of abode of the  spirit, and the left body crumbled to dust when the spirit went out of  it to continue its existence elsewhere, but that those who hated the  thought of such change could, by taking thought, prolong life and live  for a thousand years, like the adder and tortoise or for ever. But no,  he would not leave the poor boy to grope alone and blindly after that  hidden knowledge he was burning to possess. He pitied him too much. The  means were simple and near to hand, the earth teemed with the virtue  that would save him from the dissolution which so appalled him. He would  be startled to hear in how small a thing and in how insignificant a  creature resided the principle that could make his body, like his  spirit, immortal. But exceeding great power often existed in small  compass: witness the adder's tooth, which was to our sight no more than  the point of the smallest thorn. Now, in the small ant there exists a  principle of a greater potency than any other in nature; so strong and  penetrating was it that even the dull and brutish kind of men who  enquire not into hidden things know something of its power. But the  greatest of all the many qualities of this acid was unknown to them. The  ants were a small people, but exceedingly wise and powerful. If a little  human child had the strength of an ant he would surpass in power the  mightiest giant that ever lived. In the same way ants surpassed men in  wisdom; and this strength and wisdom was the result of that acid  principle in them. Now, if any person should be able to overcome his  repugnance to so strange a food as to sustain himself on ants and  nothing else, the effect of the acid on him would be to change and  harden his flesh and make it impervious to decay or change of any kind.  He would, so long as he confined himself to this kind of food, be  immortal.    Not a moment did the wretched boy hesitate to make use of this new and  wonderful knowledge. When he had found and broken open an ant-hill, so  eager was he that, shutting his eyes, he snatched up the maddened  insects by handfuls and swallowed them, dust and ants together, and was  then tortured for hours, feeling and thinking that they were still alive  within him, running about in search of an outlet and frantically biting.  The strange food sickened him, so that he grew thinner and paler, until  at last he could barely crawl on hands and feet, and was like a skeleton  except for the great sad eyes that could still see the green earth and  blue sky, and still reflected in their depths one fear and one desire.  And slowly, day by day, as his system accustomed itself to the new diet,  his strength returned, and he was able once more to walk erect and run,  and to climb a tree, where he could sit concealed among the thick  foliage and survey the village where he had first seen the light and had  passed the careless, happy years of boyhood. But he cherished no tender  memories and regrets; his sole thought was of the ants, and where to  find a sufficiency of them to stay the cravings of hunger; for, after  the first sensations of disgust had been overcome, he had begun to grow  fond of this kind of food, and now consumed it with avidity. And as his  strength increased so did his dexterity in catching the small, active  insect prey. He no longer gathered the ants up in his palm and swallowed  them along with dust and grit, but picked them up deftly, and conveyed  them one by one to his mouth with lightning rapidity. Meanwhile that  \"acid principle,\" about which he had heard such wonderful things, was  having its effect on his system. His skin changed its colour; he grew  shrunken and small, until at length, after very many years, he dwindled  to the grey little manikin of the present time. His mind, too, changed;  he has no thought nor remembrance of his former life and condition and  of his long-dead relations; but he still haunts the village where he  knows so well where to find the small ants, to pick them from off the  ant-hill and from"]]]
