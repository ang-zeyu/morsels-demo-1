But while in the city of Aberdeen, Rob Roy met a relation of a very  different class and character from those whom he was sent to summon to  arms. This was Dr. James Gregory (by descent a MacGregor), the patriarch  of a dynasty of professors distinguished for literary and scientific  talent, and the grandfather of the late eminent physician and  accomplished scholar, Professor Gregory of Edinburgh. This gentleman was  at the time Professor of Medicine in King's College, Aberdeen, and son of  Dr. James Gregory, distinguished in science as the inventor of the  reflecting telescope. With such a family it may seem our friend Rob could  have had little communion. But civil war is a species of misery which  introduces men to strange bed-fellows. Dr. Gregory thought it a point of  prudence to claim kindred, at so critical a period, with a man so  formidable and influential. He invited Rob Roy to his house, and treated  him with so much kindness, that he produced in his generous bosom a  degree of gratitude which seemed likely to occasion very inconvenient  effects.    The Professor had a son about eight or nine years old,--a lively, stout  boy of his age,--with whose appearance our Highland Robin Hood was much  taken. On the day before his departure from the house of his learned  relative, Rob Roy, who had pondered deeply how he might requite his  cousin's kindness, took Dr. Gregory aside, and addressed him to this  purport:--\"My dear kinsman, I have been thinking what I could do to show  my sense of your hospitality. Now, here you have a fine spirited boy of a  son, whom you are ruining by cramming him with your useless  book-learning, and I am determined, by way of manifesting my great  good-will to you and yours, to take him with me and make a man of him.\"  The learned Professor was utterly overwhelmed when his warlike kinsman  announced his kind purpose in language which implied no doubt of its  being a proposal which, would be, and ought to be, accepted with the  utmost gratitude. The task of apology or explanation was of a most  delicate description; and there might have been considerable danger in  suffering Rob Roy to perceive that the promotion with which he threatened  the son was, in the father's eyes, the ready road to the gallows. Indeed,  every excuse which he could at first think of--such as regret for putting  his friend to trouble with a youth who had been educated in the Lowlands,  and so on--only strengthened the chieftain's inclination to patronise his  young kinsman, as he supposed they arose entirely from the modesty of the  father. He would for a long time take no apology, and even spoke of  carrying off the youth by a certain degree of kindly violence, whether  his father consented, or not. At length the perplexed Professor pleaded  that his son was very young, and in an infirm state of health, and not  yet able to endure the hardships of a mountain life; but that in another  year or two he hoped his health would be firmly established, and he would  be in a fitting condition to attend on his brave kinsman, and follow out  the splendid destinies to which he opened the way. This agreement being  made, the cousins parted,--Rob Roy pledging his honour to carry his young  relation to the hills with him on his next return to Aberdeenshire, and  Dr. Gregory, doubtless, praying in his secret soul that he might never  see Rob's Highland face again.    James Gregory, who thus escaped being his kinsman's recruit, and in all  probability his henchman, was afterwards Professor of Medicine in the  College, and, like most of his family, distinguished by his scientific  acquirements. He was rather of an irritable and pertinacious disposition;  and his friends were wont to remark, when he showed any symptom of these  foibles, \"Ah! this comes of not having been educated by Rob Roy.\"    The connection between Rob Roy and his classical kinsman did not end with  the period of Rob's transient power. At a period considerably subsequent  to the year 1715, he was walking in the Castle Street of Aberdeen, arm in  arm with his host, Dr. James Gregory, when the drums in the barracks  suddenly beat to arms, and soldiers were seen issuing from the barracks.  \"If these lads are turning out,\" said Rob, taking leave of his cousin  with great composure, \"it is time for me to look after my safety.\" So  saying, he dived down a close, and, as John Bunyan says, \"went upon his  way and was seen no more.\"*    * The first of these anecdotes, which brings the highest pitch of  civilisation so  closely in contact with the half-savage state of  society, I have heard told by the late distinguished Dr. Gregory; and the  members of his family have had the kindness to collate the story with  their recollections and family documents, and furnish the authentic  particulars. The second rests on the recollection of an old man, who was  present when Rob took French leave of his literary cousin on hearing the  drums beat, and communicated the circumstance to Mr. Alexander Forbes, a  connection of Dr. Gregory by marriage, who is still alive.    We have already stated that Rob Roy's conduct during the insurrection of  1715 was very equivocal. His person and followers were in the Highland  army, but his heart seems to have been with the Duke of Argyle's. Yet the  insurgents were constrained to trust to him as their only guide, when  they marched from Perth towards Dunblane, with the view of crossing the  Forth at what are called the Fords of Frew, and when they themselves said  he could not be relied upon.    This movement to the westward, on the part of the insurgents, brought on  the battle of Sheriffmuir--indecisive, indeed, in its immediate results,  but of which the Duke of Argyle reaped the whole advantage. In this  action, it will be recollected that the right wing of the Highlanders  broke and cut to pieces Argyle's left wing, while the clans on the left  of Mar's army, though consisting of Stewarts, Mackenzies, and Camerons,  were completely routed. During this medley of flight and pursuit, Rob Roy  retained his station on a hill in the centre of the Highland position;  and though it is said his attack might have decided the day, he could not  be prevailed upon to charge. This was the more unfortunate for the  insurgents, as the leading of a party of the Macphersons had been  committed to MacGregor. This, it is said, was owing to the age and  infirmity of the chief of that name, who, unable to lead his clan in  person, objected to his heir-apparent, Macpherson of Nord, discharging  his duty on that occasion; so that the tribe, or a part of them, were  brigaded with their allies the MacGregors. While the favourable moment  for action was gliding away unemployed, Mar's positive orders reached Rob  Roy that he should presently attack. To which he coolly replied, \"No, no!  if they cannot do it without me, they cannot do it with me.\" One of the  Macphersons, named Alexander, one of Rob's original profession,  _videlicet,_ a drover, but a man of great strength and spirit, was so  incensed at the inactivity of this temporary leader, that he threw off  his plaid, drew his sword, and called out to his clansmen, \"Let us endure  this no longer! if he will not lead you I will.\" Rob Roy replied, with  great coolness, \"Were the question about driving Highland stots or  kyloes, Sandie, I would yield to your superior skill; but as it respects  the leading of men, I must be allowed to be the better judge.\"--\"Did the  matter respect driving Glen-Eigas stots,\" answered the Macpherson, \"the  question with Rob would not be, which was to be last, but which was to be  foremost.\" Incensed at this sarcasm, MacGregor drew his sword, and they  would have fought upon the spot if their friends on both sides had not  interfered. But the moment of attack was completely lost. Rob did not,  however, neglect his own private interest on the occasion. In the  confusion of an undecided field of battle, he enriched his followers by  plundering the baggage and the dead on both sides.    The fine old satirical ballad on the battle of Sheriffmuir does not  forget to stigmatise our hero's conduct on this memorable occasion--                            Rob Roy he stood watch                          On a hill for to catch                   The booty for aught that I saw, man;                           For he ne'er advanced                   From the place where he stanced,                   Till nae mair was to do there at a', man.    Notwithstanding the sort of neutrality which Rob Roy had continued to  observe during the progress of the Rebellion, he did not escape some of  its penalties. He was included in the act of attainder, and the house in  Breadalbane, which was his place of retreat, was burned by General Lord  Cadogan, when, after the conclusion of the insurrection, he marched  through the Highlands to disarm and punish the offending clans. But upon  going to Inverary with about forty or fifty of his followers, Rob  obtained favour, by an apparent surrender of their arms to Colonel  Patrick Campbell of Finnah, who furnished them and their leader with  protections under his hand. Being thus in a great measure secured from  the resentment of government, Rob Roy established his residence at  Craig-Royston, near Loch Lomond, in the midst of his own kinsmen, and  lost no time in resuming his private quarrel with the Duke of Montrose.  For this purpose he soon got on foot as many men, and well armed too, as  he had yet commanded. He never stirred without a body-guard of ten or  twelve picked followers, and without much effort could increase them to  fifty or sixty.    The Duke was not wanting in efforts to destroy this troublesome  adversary. His Grace applied to General Carpenter, commanding the forces  in Scotland, and by his orders three parties of soldiers were directed  from the three different points of Glasgow, Stirling,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],[0,"Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#7)"],[1,"lay the little speaker, a lovely smile was upon the face, her hand  was in that of the father, but she had gone to be among the angels.    --_Power of Prayer_ by Prime.

I hope it will lead you  to think of Him who died a dreadful death on the cross, that we might  be saved from sin and sorrow here, and at last dwell with Him in bright  mansions in the skies.    This little girl lived near a deep ravine at the foot of one of the  mountains in Switzerland. A huge rock had fallen down the mountain side,  and lodged in the ravine, and thus made a natural bridge, so that those  who wished to pass from one side of the mountain to the other, could  cross the bridge.    The mother of the child was an earnest Christian, and often told her  daughter about the blessed Savior, who died in the place of sinners,  who deserved to be punished that they might be forgiven and saved in  heaven. And she told her also that unless she came to Jesus, and trusted  in Him, she would be lost forever. At first the little girl did not care  very much about what her mother said, but at last the mother's prayer  was answered. Her little one felt herself to be a lost sinner, and that  Christ alone could save her. God's spirit taught her that Jesus had paid  the debt, and that He stood with open arms ready to receive her, and  wash her sins away. Then she felt sure that heaven would be her home  forever. Her father was not a Christian. He never gathered his loved  ones around the family altar.    One day when about to cross the deep ravine upon the rock bridge, the  mother saw that it was just ready to fall. The frost had loosened it.  She told her little child that if she ever crossed it again it would  fall, and she would be dashed in pieces.    [Illustration]    The next day the father told his child that he was going over to the  other side across the bridge. She told him it was not safe, but he only  laughed at her. He said he had been across it before she was born, and  that he was not afraid. When the dear little thing saw that he was  determined to go she asked if she could go with him.    While they were walking along together, she looked up into her father's  face, and said: \"Father, if I should die, will you promise to love Jesus  and meet me in heaven?\"    \"Pshaw!\" he said, \"what put such a wild thought into your head? You are  not going to die, I hope. You are only a wee thing and will live many  years.\"    \"Yes, but if I should die, will you promise to love Jesus just as I do,  and meet me in heaven?\"    \"But you are not going to die. Don't speak of it,\" he said.    \"But if I should die, do promise, Father, you will be a good Christian  and come up and live with Jesus and me in heaven.\"    \"Yes, yes!\" he said at last.    When they came near the crossing-place, she said: \"Father, please stand  here a minute.\" She loved him dearly and was willing to run the risk of  dying for him. Strange as it may seem she walked quickly and jumped upon  the loose rock, and down it went with the girl. She was crushed to death.  The trembling parent crept to the edge, and eyes dimmed with tears, gazed  wildly upon the wreck. Then he thought of all his little child had told  him about how Jesus had died to save us. He thought he had never loved  her so much. But he began to see that he had far more reason to love  Jesus who had suffered much more to save him from the \"bottomless pit.\"  And then he thought of the promise he so carefully made to his daughter.  What could he do but kneel down and cry to God to have mercy upon him?    If they meet in heaven, do you think that daughter will be sorry that  she sacrificed her life for her father's sake? Can you not imagine that  tears often filled the eyes of that father when he spoke of his sainted  little one?    You would say that he would have been a very wicked man if he had not  loved the memory of his child. But is it not a thousand times more wicked  for you not to love Him who has loved you so much more than that little  one loved her father?    How can you help loving such a precious Savior? Will you not ask Him  to forgive you and help you to live for Him the rest of your life?    --_The Way of Faith_        \"FORGOTTEN MY SOUL\"    \"Mother, you have forgotten my soul,\" so said a little girl, three years  old as her kind and careful mother was about to lay her in bed. She had  just risen from repeating the Lord's prayer. \"But, Mother,\" she said,  \"you have forgotten my soul.\"    \"What do you mean, Anna?\"    \"Why,      'Now I lay me down to sleep,    I pray the Lord my soul to keep!    If I should die before I wake,    I pray the Lord my soul to take.'    \"We have not said that.\"    The child meant nothing more, yet her words were startling. And, oh!  from how many rosy lips might they come with mournful significance!    [Illustration]    You, fond mother, so busy hour after hour preparing and adorning garments  for their pretty little form, have you forgotten the soul? Do you commend  it earnestly to the care of its God and Savior? Are you leading it to  commit itself, in faith and love to his keeping?--Selected.        PREVAILING PRAYER OF A CHILD    At the close of a prayer-meeting, the pastor observed a little girl about  twelve years of age remaining upon her knees, when most of the congregation  had retired. Thinking the child had fallen asleep, he touched her and  told her it was time to return home. To his surprise he found that she  was engaged in prayer, and he said: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask  in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\" She looked up at the pastor  earnestly, and inquired: \"Is that so? Does God say that?\"    [Illustration]    He took up a Bible and read the passage aloud. She immediately began  praying: \"Lord, send my father here; Lord, send my father to the chapel.\"  Thus she continued for about half an hour, attracting by her earnest cry  the attentions of persons who had lingered about the door. At last a man  rushed into the chapel, ran up the aisle and sank upon his knees by the  side of his child, exclaiming: \"What do you want of me?\" She threw her  arms about his neck, and began to pray: \"Oh, Lord, convert my father!\"  Soon the man's heart was melted and he began to pray for himself. The  child's father was three miles from the chapel when she began praying  for him. He was packing goods in a wagon and felt impressed with an  irresistible impulse to return home. Driving rapidly to his house, he  left the goods in his wagon and hastened to the chapel, where he found  his daughter crying mightily to God in his behalf; and he was led there  to the Savior.    --_Foster's Encyclopedia_        THE DYING NEWS BOY    In a dark alley in the great city of New York, a small, ragged boy might  be seen. He appeared to be about twelve years old, and had a careworn  expression on his countenance. The cold air seemed to have no pity as  it pierced through his ragged clothes, and made the flesh beneath blue  and almost frozen.    [Illustration: \"I am dying now, because I feel so queer; and I can hardly  see you. I can kinder see the angels holding out their hands for me to  come to that beautiful place they call heaven.\"]    This poor boy had once a happy home. His parents died a year before, and  left him without money or friends. He was compelled to face the cold,  cruel world with but a few cents in his pocket. He tried to earn his  living by selling newspapers and other such things. This day everything  seemed to go against him, and in despair he threw himself down in the  dark alley, with his papers by his side. A few boys gathered around the  poor lad, and asked in a kind way (for a street Arab): \"Say, Johnny, why  don't you go to the lodges?\" (The lodge was a place where almost all the  boys stayed at night, costing but a few cents.) But the poor little lad  could only murmur that he could not stir, and called the boys about him,  saying: \"I am dying now, because I feel so queer: and I can hardly see  you. Gather around me closer boys. I cannot talk so loud. I can kinder  see the angels holding out their hands for me to come to that beautiful  place called heaven. Goodbye, boys. I am to meet father and mother.\"  And, with these last words on his lips, the poor lad died.    Next morning the passers-by saw a sight that would soften the most  hardened heart. There, lying on the cold stone, with his head against  the hard wall, and his eyes staring upward, was the poor little frozen  newsboy. He was taken to the chapel near by, and was interred by kind  hands. And those who performed this act will never forget the poor  forsaken lad.    --_Golden Dawn_     "]]]
