Mr Ivery was in the chair--the first  I had seen of him--a plump middle-aged man, with a colourless face and  nondescript features. I was not interested in him till he began to  talk, and then I sat bolt upright and took notice. For he was the  genuine silver-tongue, the sentences flowing from his mouth as smooth  as butter and as neatly dovetailed as a parquet floor. He had a sort of  man-of-the-world manner, treating his opponents with condescending  geniality, deprecating all passion and exaggeration and making you feel  that his urbane statement must be right, for if he had wanted he could  have put the case so much higher. I watched him, fascinated, studying  his face carefully; and the thing that struck me was that there was  nothing in it--nothing, that is to say, to lay hold on. It was simply  nondescript, so almightily commonplace that that very fact made it  rather remarkable.    Wake was speaking of the revelations of the Sukhomhnov trial in Russia,  which showed that Germany had not been responsible for the war. He was  jolly good at the job, and put as clear an argument as a first-class  lawyer. I had been sweating away at the subject and had all the  ordinary case at my fingers' ends, so when I got a chance of speaking I  gave them a long harangue, with some good quotations I had cribbed out  of the _Vossische Zeitung_, which Letchford lent me. I felt it was up  to me to be extra violent, for I wanted to establish my character with  Wake, seeing that he was a friend of Mary and Mary would know that I  was playing the game. I got tremendously applauded, far more than the  chief speaker, and after the meeting Wake came up to me with his hot  eyes, and wrung my hand. 'You're coming on well, Brand,' he said, and  then he introduced me to Mr Ivery. 'Here's a second and a better  Smuts,' he said.    Ivery made me walk a bit of the road home with him. 'I am struck by  your grip on these difficult problems, Mr Brand,' he told me. 'There is  much I can tell you, and you may be of great value to our cause.' He  asked me a lot of questions about my past, which I answered with easy  mendacity. Before we parted he made me promise to come one night to  supper.    Next day I got a glimpse of Mary, and to my vexation she cut me dead.  She was walking with a flock of bare-headed girls, all chattering hard,  and though she saw me quite plainly she turned away her eyes. I had  been waiting for my cue, so I did not lift my hat, but passed on as if  we were strangers. I reckoned it was part of the game, but that  trifling thing annoyed me, and I spent a morose evening.    The following day I saw her again, this time talking sedately with Mr  Ivery, and dressed in a very pretty summer gown, and a broad-brimmed  straw hat with flowers in it. This time she stopped with a bright smile  and held out her hand. 'Mr Brand, isn't it?' she asked with a pretty  hesitation. And then, turning to her companion--'This is Mr Brand. He  stayed with us last month in Gloucestershire.'    Mr Ivery announced that he and I were already acquainted. Seen in broad  daylight he was a very personable fellow, somewhere between forty-five  and fifty, with a middle-aged figure and a curiously young face. I  noticed that there were hardly any lines on it, and it was rather that  of a very wise child than that of a man. He had a pleasant smile which  made his jaw and cheeks expand like indiarubber. 'You are coming to sup  with me, Mr Brand,' he cried after me. 'On Tuesday after Moot. I have  already written.' He whisked Mary away from me, and I had to content  myself with contemplating her figure till it disappeared round a bend  of the road.    Next day in London I found a letter from Peter. He had been very solemn  of late, and very reminiscent of old days now that he concluded his  active life was over. But this time he was in a different mood. '_I  think,_' he wrote, '_that you and I will meet again soon, my old  friend. Do you remember when we went after the big black-maned lion in  the Rooirand and couldn't get on his track, and then one morning we  woke up and said we would get him today?--and we did, but he very near  got you first. I've had a feel these last days that we're both going  down into the Valley to meet with Apolyon, and that the devil will give  us a bad time, but anyhow we'll be together._'    I had the same kind of feel myself, though I didn't see how Peter and I  were going to meet, unless I went out to the Front again and got put in  the bag and sent to the same Boche prison. But I had an instinct that  my time in Biggleswick was drawing to a close, and that presently I  would be in rougher quarters. I felt quite affectionate towards the  place, and took all my favourite walks, and drank my own health in the  brew of the village inns, with a consciousness of saying goodbye. Also  I made haste to finish my English classics, for I concluded I wouldn't  have much time in the future for miscellaneous reading.    The Tuesday came, and in the evening I set out rather late for the Moot  Hall, for I had been getting into decent clothes after a long, hot  stride. When I reached the place it was pretty well packed, and I could  only find a seat on the back benches. There on the platform was Ivery,  and beside him sat a figure that thrilled every inch of me with  affection and a wild anticipation. 'I have now the privilege,' said the  chairman, 'of introducing to you the speaker whom we so warmly welcome,  our fearless and indefatigable American friend, Mr Blenkiron.'    It was the old Blenkiron, but almightily changed. His stoutness had  gone, and he was as lean as Abraham Lincoln. Instead of a puffy face,  his cheek-bones and jaw stood out hard and sharp, and in place of his  former pasty colour his complexion had the clear glow of health. I saw  now that he was a splendid figure of a man, and when he got to his feet  every movement had the suppleness of an athlete in training. In that  moment I realized that my serious business had now begun. My senses  suddenly seemed quicker, my nerves tenser, my brain more active. The  big game had started, and he and I were playing it together.    I watched him with strained attention. It was a funny speech, stuffed  with extravagance and vehemence, not very well argued and terribly  discursive. His main point was that Germany was now in a fine  democratic mood and might well be admitted into a brotherly  partnership--that indeed she had never been in any other mood, but had  been forced into violence by the plots of her enemies. Much of it, I  should have thought, was in stark defiance of the Defence of the Realm  Acts, but if any wise Scotland Yard officer had listened to it he would  probably have considered it harmless because of its contradictions. It  was full of a fierce earnestness, and it was full of humour--long-drawn  American metaphors at which that most critical audience roared with  laughter. But it was not the kind of thing that they were accustomed  to, and I could fancy what Wake would have said of it. The conviction  grew upon me that Blenkiron was deliberately trying to prove himself an  honest idiot. If so, it was a huge success. He produced on one the  impression of the type of sentimental revolutionary who ruthlessly  knifes his opponent and then weeps and prays over his tomb.    Just at the end he seemed to pull himself together and to try a little  argument. He made a great point of the Austrian socialists going to  Stockholm, going freely and with their Government's assent, from a  country which its critics called an autocracy, while the democratic  western peoples held back. 'I admit I haven't any real water-tight  proof,' he said, 'but I will bet my bottom dollar that the influence  which moved the Austrian Government to allow this embassy of freedom  was the influence of Germany herself. And that is the land from which  the Allied Pharisees draw in their skirts lest their garments be  defiled!'    He sat down amid a good deal of applause, for his audience had not been  bored, though I could see that some of them thought his praise of  Germany a bit steep. It was all right in Biggleswick to prove Britain  in the wrong, but it was a slightly different thing to extol the enemy.  I was puzzled about his last point, for it was not of a piece with the  rest of his discourse, and I was trying to guess at his purpose. The  chairman referred to it in his concluding remarks. 'I am in a  position,' he said, 'to bear out all that the lecturer has said. I can  go further. I can assure him on the best authority that his surmise is  correct, and that Vienna's decision to send delegates to Stockholm was  largely dictated by representations from Berlin. I am given to  understand that the fact has in the last few days been admitted in the  Austrian Press.'    A vote of thanks was carried, and then I found myself shaking hands  with Ivery while Blenkiron stood a yard off, talking to one of the  Misses Weekes. The next moment I was being introduced.    'Mr Brand, very pleased to meet you,' said the voice I knew so well.  'Mr Ivery has been telling me about you, and I guess we've got  something to say to each other. We're both from noo countries, and  we've got to teach the old nations a little horse-sense.'    Mr Ivery's car--the only one left in the neighbourhood--carried us to  his villa, and presently we were seated in a brightly-lit dining-room.  It was not a pretty house, but it had the luxury of an expensive hotel,  and the supper we had was as good as any London restaurant. Gone were  the old days of fish and toast and boiled milk. Blenkiron squared his  shoulders and showed himself a noble trencherman.    'A year ago,' he told our host, 'I was the meanest kind of dyspeptic. I  had the love of righteousness in my heart, but I had the devil in my  stomach. Then I heard stories about the Robson Brothers, the star  surgeons way out west in White Springs, Nebraska.

Another buried and  arched epicotyl was observed in the same manner, excepting that the two  legs of the arch were tied together with fine silk for the sake of  preventing the great movement just mentioned. It moved, however, in the  evening in the same direction as before, but the line followed was not so  straight. During the morning the tied arch moved in an irregularly  circular, strongly zigzag course, and to a greater distance than in the  previous case, as was shown in a tracing, magnified 18 times. The movements  of a young plant bearing a few leaves and of a mature plant, will hereafter  be described.    Fig. 16. Tropaeolum minus (?): circumnutation of buried and arched  epicotyl, traced on a horizontal glass, from 9.20 A.M. to 8.15 P.M.  Movement of bead of filament magnified 27 times.  [page 28]    Citrus aurantium (Orange) (Aurantiaceae).--The cotyledons are hypogean. The  circumnutation of an epicotyl, which at the close of our observations was  .59 of an inch (15 mm.) in height above the ground, is shown in the annexed  figure (Fig. 17), as observed during a period of 44 h. 40 m.    Fig. 17. Citrus aurantium: circumnutation of epicotyl with a filament fixed  transversely near its apex, traced on a horizontal glass, from 12.13 P.M.  on Feb. 20th to 8.55 A.M. on 22nd. The movement of the bead of the filament  was at first magnified 21 times, or 10 1/2, in figure here given, and  afterwards 36 times, or 18 as here given; seedling illuminated from above.    Aesculus hippocastanum (Hippocastaneae).--Germinating seeds were placed in  a tin box, kept moist internally, with a sloping bank of damp argillaceous  sand, on which four smoked glass-plates rested, inclined at angles of 70o  and 65o with the horizon. The tips of the radicles were placed so as just  to touch the upper end of the glass-plates, and, as they grew downwards  they pressed lightly, owing to geotropism, on the smoked surfaces, and left  tracks of their course. In the middle part of each track the glass was  swept clean, but the margins were much blurred and irregular. Copies of two  of these tracks (all four being nearly alike) were made on tracing paper  placed over the glass-plates after they had been varnished; and they are as  exact as possible considering the nature of the margins (Fig. 18). They  suffice to show that there was some lateral, almost serpentine movement,  and that the tips in their downward course pressed with unequal force on  the plates, as  [page 29]  the tracks varied in breadth. The more perfectly serpentine tracks made by  the radicles of Phaseolus multiflorus and Vicia faba (presently to be  described), render it almost certain that the radicles of the present plant  circumnutated.    Fig. 18. Aesculus hippocastanum: outlines of tracks left on inclined  glass-plates by tips of radicles. In A the plate was inclined at 70o with  the horizon, and the radicle was 1.9 inch in length, and .23 inch in  diameter at base. In B the plate was inclined 65o with the horizon, and the  radicle was a trifle larger.    Phaseolus multiflorus (Leguminosae).--Four smoked glass-plates were  arranged in the same manner as described under Aesculus, and the tracks  left by the tips of four radicles of the present plant, whilst growing  downwards, were photographed as transparent objects. Three of them are here  exactly copied (Fig. 19). Their serpentine courses show that the tips moved  regularly from side to side; they also pressed alternately with greater or  less force on the plates, sometimes rising up and leaving them altogether  for a very short distance; but this was better seen on the original plates  than in the copies. These radicles therefore were continually moving in all  directions--that is, they circumnutated. The distance between the extreme  right and left positions of the radicle A, in its lateral movement, was 2  mm., as ascertained by measurement with an eye-piece micrometer.    Fig. 19. Phaseolus multiflorus: tracks left on inclined smoked glass-plates  by tips of radicles in growing downwards. A and C, plates inclined at 60o,  B inclined at 68o with the horizon.    Vicia faba (Common Bean) (Leguminosae).--Radicle.--Some beans were allowed  to germinate on bare sand, and after one had protruded its radicle to a  length of .2 of an inch, it was turned upside down, so that the radicle,  which was kept in damp air, now stood upright. A filament, nearly an inch  in length, was affixed obliquely near its tip; and the movement of the  terminal bead was traced from 8.30 A.M. to 10.30 P.M., as shown in Fig. 18.  The radicle at first changed its course twice  [page 30]  abruptly, then made a small loop and then a larger zigzag curve. During the  night and till 11 A.M. on the following    Fig. 20. Vicia faba: circumnutation of a radicle, at first pointing  vertically upwards, kept in darkness, traced on a horizontal glass, during  14 hours. Movement of bead of filament magnified 23 times, here reduced to  one-half of original scale.    morning, the bead moved to a great distance in a nearly straight line, in  the direction indicated by the broken line in the figure. This resulted  from the tip bending quickly downwards, as it had now become much declined,  and had thus gained a position highly favourable for the action of  geotropism.  Fig. 21. Vicia faba: tracks left on inclined smoked glass-plates, by tips  of radicles in growing downwards. Plate C was inclined at 63o, plates A and  D at 71o, plate B at 75o, and plate E at a few degrees beneath the horizon.  [page 31]    We next experimented on nearly a score of radicles by allowing them to grow  downwards over inclined plates of smoked glass, in exactly the same manner  as with Aesculus and Phaseolus. Some of the plates were inclined only a few  degrees beneath the horizon, but most of them between 60o and 75o. In the  latter cases the radicles in growing downwards were deflected only a little  from the direction which they had followed whilst germinating in sawdust,  and they pressed lightly on the glass-plates (Fig. 21). Five of the most  distinct tracks are here copied, and they are all slightly sinuous, showing  circumnutation. Moreover, a close examination of almost every one of the  tracks clearly showed that the tips in their downward course had  alternately pressed with greater or less force on the plates, and had  sometimes risen up so as nearly to leave them for short intervals. The  distance between the extreme right and left positions of the radicle A was  0.7 mm., ascertained in the same manner as in the case of Phaseolus.    Epicotyl.--At the point where the radicle had protruded from a bean laid on  its side, a flattened solid lump projected .1 of an inch, in the same  horizontal plane with the bean. This protuberance consisted of the convex  summit of the arched epicotyl; and as it became developed the two legs of  the arch curved themselves laterally upwards, owing to apogeotropism, at  such a rate that the arch stood highly inclined after 14 h., and vertically  in 48 h. A filament was fixed to the crown of the protuberance before any  arch was visible, but the basal half grew so quickly that on the second  morning the end of the filament was bowed greatly downwards. It was  therefore removed and fixed lower down. The line traced during these two  days extended in the same general direction, and was in parts nearly  straight, and in others plainly zigzag, thus giving some evidence of  circumnutation.    As the arched epicotyl, in whatever position it may be placed, bends  quickly upwards through apogeotropism, and as the two legs tend at a very  early age to separate from one another, as soon as they are relieved from  the pressure of the surrounding earth, it was difficult to ascertain  positively whether the epicotyl, whilst remaining arched, circumnutated.  Therefore some rather deeply buried beans were uncovered, and the two legs  of the arches were tied together, as had been done with the epicotyl of  Tropaeolum and the hypocotyl of the Cabbage. The movements of the tied  arches were traced in the usual manner on  [page 32]  two occasions during three days. But the tracings made under such unnatural  conditions are not worth giving; and it need only be said that the lines  were decidedly zigzag, and that small loops were occasionally formed. We  may therefore conclude that the epicotyl circumnutates whilst still arched  and before it has grown tall enough to break through the surface of the  ground.    In order to observe the movements of the epicotyl at a somewhat more  advanced age, a filament was fixed near the base of one which was no longer  arched, for its upper half now formed a right angle with the lower half.  This bean had germinated on bare damp sand, and the epicotyl began to  straighten itself much sooner than would have occurred if it had been  properly planted. The course pursued during 50 h. (from 9 A.M. Dec. 26th,  to 11 A.M. 28th) is here shown (Fig. 22); and we see  Fig. 22. Vicia faba: circumnutation of young epicotyl, traced in darkness  during 50 hours on a horizontal glass. Movement of bead of filament  magnified 20 times, here reduced to one-half of original scale.    that the epicotyl circumnutated during the whole time. Its basal part grew  so much during the 50 h. that the filament at the end of our observations  was attached at the height of .4 inch above the upper surface of the bean,  instead of close to it. If the bean had been properly planted, this part of  the epicotyl would still have been beneath the soil.    Late in the evening of the 28th, some hours after the above observations  were completed, the epicotyl had grown much straighter, for the upper part  now formed a widely open angle with the lower "]]]
