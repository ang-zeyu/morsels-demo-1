But this barter introduced the use of money, as  might be expected; for a convenient place from whence to import what you  wanted, or to export what you had a surplus of, being often at a great  distance, money necessarily made its way into commerce; for it is not  everything which is naturally most useful that is easiest of carriage;  for which reason they invented something to exchange with each other  which they should mutually give and take, that being really valuable  itself, should have the additional advantage of being of easy  conveyance, for the purposes of life, as iron and silver, or anything  else of the same nature: and this at first passed in value simply  according to its weight or size; but in process of time it had a certain  stamp, to save the trouble of weighing, which stamp expressed its value.  [1257b]    Money then being established as the necessary medium of exchange,  another species of money-getting soon took place, namely, by buying  and selling, at probably first in a simple manner, afterwards with more  skill and experience, where and how the greatest profits might be made.  For which reason the art of money-getting seems to be chiefly conversant  about trade, and the business of it to be able to tell where the  greatest profits can be made, being the means of procuring abundance  of wealth and possessions: and thus wealth is very often supposed to  consist in the quantity of money which any one possesses, as this is the  medium by which all trade is conducted and a fortune made, others again  regard it as of no value, as being of none by nature, but arbitrarily  made so by compact; so that if those who use it should alter their  sentiments, it would be worth nothing, as being of no service for  any necessary purpose. Besides, he who abounds in money often wants  necessary food; and it is impossible to say that any person is in good  circumstances when with all his possessions he may perish with hunger.    Like Midas in the fable, who from his insatiable wish had everything he  touched turned into gold. For which reason others endeavour to procure  other riches and other property, and rightly, for there are other riches  and property in nature; and these are the proper objects of economy:  while trade only procures money, not by all means, but by the exchange  of it, and for that purpose it is this which it is chiefly employed  about, for money is the first principle and the end of trade; nor are  there any bounds to be set to what is thereby acquired. Thus also there  are no limits to the art of medicine, with respect to the health which  it attempts to procure; the same also is true of all other arts; no line  can be drawn to terminate their bounds, the several professors of them  being desirous to extend them as far as possible. (But still the means  to be employed for that purpose are limited; and these are the limits  beyond which the art cannot proceed.) Thus in the art of acquiring  riches there are no limits, for the object of that is money and  possessions; but economy has a boundary, though this has not: for  acquiring riches is not the business of that, for which reason it should  seem that some boundary should be set to riches, though we see the  contrary to this is what is practised; for all those who get riches add  to their money without end; the cause of which is the near connection  of these two arts with each other, which sometimes occasions the one to  change employments with the other, as getting of money is their common  object: for economy requires the possession of wealth, but not on  its own account but with another view, to purchase things necessary  therewith; but the other procures it merely to increase it: so that some  persons are confirmed in their belief, that this is the proper object  of economy, and think that for this purpose money should be saved and  hoarded up without end; the reason for which disposition is, that they  are intent upon living, but not upon living well; and this desire being  boundless in its extent, the means which they aim at for that purpose  are boundless also; and those who propose to live well, often confine  that to the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense; so that as this also  seems to depend upon what a man has, all their care is to get money,  and hence arises the other cause for this art; for as this enjoyment is  excessive in its degree, they endeavour to procure means proportionate  to supply it; and if they cannot do this merely by the art of dealing in  money, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all their  powers to a purpose they were not by nature intended for. Thus, for  instance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, not to get money  by; neither is this the end of the soldier's or the physician's art,  but victory and health. But such persons make everything subservient to  money-getting, as if this was the only end; and to the end everything  ought to refer.    We have now considered that art of money-getting which is not necessary,  and have seen in what manner we became in want of it; and also that  which is necessary, which is different from it; for that economy which  is natural, and whose object is to provide food, is not like this  unlimited in its extent, but has its bounds.          CHAPTER X      We have now determined what was before doubtful, whether or no the art  of getting money is his business who is at the head of a family or a  state, and though not strictly so, it is however very necessary; for  as a politician does not make men, but receiving them from the hand of  nature employs them to proper purposes; thus the earth, or the sea, or  something else ought to supply them with provisions, and this it is the  business of the master of the family to manage properly; for it is not  the weaver's business to make yarn, but to use it, and to distinguish  what is good and useful from what is bad and of no service; and indeed  some one may inquire why getting money should be a part of economy when  the art of healing is not, as it is as requisite that the family should  be in health as that they should eat, or have anything else which is  necessary; and as it is indeed in some particulars the business both of  the master of the family, and he to whom the government of the state  is entrusted, to see after the health of those under their care, but in  others not, but the physician's; so also as to money; in some respects  it is the business of the master of the family, in others not, but of  the servant; but as we have already said, it is chiefly nature's, for  it is her part to supply her offspring with food; for everything finds  nourishment left for it in what produced it; for which reason  the natural riches of all men arise from fruits and animals. Now  money-making, as we say, being twofold, it may be applied to two  purposes, the service of the house or retail trade; of which the first  is necessary and commendable, the other justly censurable; for it has  not its origin in [1258b] nature, but by it men gain from each other;  for usury is most reasonably detested, as it is increasing our fortune  by money itself, and not employing it for the purpose it was originally  intended, namely exchange.    And this is the explanation of the name (TOKOS), which means the  breeding of money. For as offspring resemble their parents, so usury  is money bred of money. Whence of all forms of money-making it is most  against nature.          CHAPTER XI      Having already sufficiently considered the general principles of this  subject, let us now go into the practical part thereof; the one is a  liberal employment for the mind, the other necessary. These things are  useful in the management of one's affairs; to be skilful in the nature  of cattle, which are most profitable, and where, and how; as for  instance, what advantage will arise from keeping horses, or oxen, or  sheep, or any other live stock; it is also necessary to be acquainted  with the comparative value of these things, and which of them in  particular places are worth most; for some do better in one place, some  in another. Agriculture also should be understood, and the management  of arable grounds and orchards; and also the care of bees, and fish, and  birds, from whence any profit may arise; these are the first and most  proper parts of domestic management.    With respect to gaining money by exchange, the principal method of doing  this is by merchandise, which is carried on in three different ways,  either by sending the commodity for sale by sea or by land, or else  selling it on the place where it grows; and these differ from each other  in this, that the one is more profitable, the other safer. The second  method is by usury. The third by receiving wages for work done, and  this either by being employed in some mean art, or else in mere bodily  labour. There is also a third species of improving a fortune, that is  something between this and the first; for it partly depends upon  nature, partly upon exchange; the subject of which is, things that are  immediately from the earth, or their produce, which, though they bear  no fruit, are yet useful, such as selling of timber and the whole art of  metallurgy, which includes many different species, for there are various  sorts of things dug out of the earth.    These we have now mentioned in general, but to enter into particulars  concerning each of them, though it might be useful to the artist, would  be tiresome to dwell on. Now of all the works of art, those are the most  excellent wherein chance has the least to do, and those are the meanest  which deprave the body, those the most servile in which bodily strength  alone is chiefly wanted, those most illiberal which require least skill;  but as there are books written on these subjects by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763"],[0,"Aristotle on the art of poetry (#7)"],[1,"to aim at. First and foremost,  that they shall be good. There will be an element of character in the  play, if (as has been observed) what a personage says or does reveals a  certain moral purpose; and a good element of character, if the  purpose so revealed is good. Such goodness is possible in every type  of personage, even in a woman or a slave, though the one is perhaps an  inferior, and the other a wholly worthless being. The second point is to  make them appropriate. The Character before us may be, say, manly; but  it is not appropriate in a female Character to be manly, or clever. The  third is to make them like the reality, which is not the same as their  being good and appropriate, in our sense of the term. The fourth is to  make them consistent and the same throughout; even if inconsistency  be part of the man before one for imitation as presenting that form  of character, he should still be consistently inconsistent. We have an  instance of baseness of character, not required for the story, in  the Menelaus in _Orestes_; of the incongruous and unbefitting in the  lamentation of Ulysses in _Scylla_, and in the (clever) speech of  Melanippe; and of inconsistency in _Iphigenia at Aulis_, where Iphigenia  the suppliant is utterly unlike the later Iphigenia. The right thing,  however, is in the Characters just as in the incidents of the play to  endeavour always after the necessary or the probable; so that whenever  such-and-such a personage says or does such-and-such a thing, it shall  be the probable or necessary outcome of his character; and whenever  this incident follows on that, it shall be either the necessary or the  probable consequence of it. From this one sees (to digress for a moment)  that the Denouement also should arise out of the plot itself, arid  not depend on a stage-artifice, as in _Medea_, or in the story of the  (arrested) departure of the Greeks in the _Iliad_. The artifice must  be reserved for matters outside the play--for past events beyond human  knowledge, or events yet to come, which require to be foretold or  announced; since it is the privilege of the Gods to know everything.  There should be nothing improbable among the actual incidents. If it  be unavoidable, however, it should be outside the tragedy, like the  improbability in the _Oedipus_ of Sophocles. But to return to the  Characters. As Tragedy is an imitation of personages better than  the ordinary man, we in our way should follow the example of good  portrait-painters, who reproduce the distinctive features of a man, and  at the same time, without losing the likeness, make him handsomer than  he is. The poet in like manner, in portraying men quick or slow to  anger, or with similar infirmities of character, must know how to  represent them as such, and at the same time as good men, as Agathon and  Homer have represented Achilles.    All these rules one must keep in mind throughout, and further, those  also for such points of stage-effect as directly depend on the art  of the poet, since in these too one may often make mistakes. Enough,  however, has been said on the subject in one of our published writings.          16      Discovery in general has been explained already. As for the species of  Discovery, the first to be noted is (1) the least artistic form of  it, of which the poets make most use through mere lack of invention,  Discovery by signs or marks. Of these signs some are congenital, like  the 'lance-head which the Earth-born have on them', or 'stars', such as  Carcinus brings in in his _Thyestes_; others acquired after birth--these  latter being either marks on the body, e.g. scars, or external tokens,  like necklaces, or to take another sort of instance, the ark in the  Discovery in _Tyro_. Even these, however, admit of two uses, a better  and a worse; the scar of Ulysses is an instance; the Discovery of  him through it is made in one way by the nurse and in another by the  swineherds. A Discovery using signs as a means of assurance is less  artistic, as indeed are all such as imply reflection; whereas one  bringing them in all of a sudden, as in the _Bath-story_, is of a better  order. Next after these are (2) Discoveries made directly by the poet;  which are inartistic for that very reason; e.g. Orestes' Discovery of  himself in _Iphigenia_: whereas his sister reveals who she is by the  letter, Orestes is made to say himself what the poet rather than  the story demands. This, therefore, is not far removed from the  first-mentioned fault, since he might have presented certain tokens  as well. Another instance is the 'shuttle's voice' in the _Tereus_ of  Sophocles. (3) A third species is Discovery through memory, from a man's  consciousness being awakened by something seen or heard. Thus in _The  Cyprioe_ of Dicaeogenes, the sight of the picture makes the man burst  into tears; and in the _Tale of Alcinous_, hearing the harper Ulysses is  reminded of the past and weeps; the Discovery of them being the  result. (4) A fourth kind is Discovery through reasoning; e.g. in _The  Choephoroe_: 'One like me is here; there is no one like me but Orestes;  he, therefore, must be here.' Or that which Polyidus the Sophist  suggested for _Iphigenia_; since it was natural for Orestes to reflect:  'My sister was sacrificed, and I am to be sacrificed like her.' Or that  in the _Tydeus_ of Theodectes: 'I came to find a son, and am to die  myself.' Or that in _The Phinidae_: on seeing the place the women  inferred their fate, that they were to die there, since they had also  been exposed there. (5) There is, too, a composite Discovery arising  from bad reasoning on the side of the other party. An instance of it is  in _Ulysses the False Messenger_: he said he should know the bow--which  he had not seen; but to suppose from that that he would know it again  (as though he had once seen it) was bad reasoning. (6) The best of all  Discoveries, however, is that arising from the incidents themselves,  when the great surprise comes about through a probable incident, like  that in the _Oedipus_ of Sophocles; and also in _Iphigenia_; for it was  not improbable that she should wish to have a letter taken home. These  last are the only Discoveries independent of the artifice of signs and  necklaces. Next after them come Discoveries through reasoning.          17      At the time when he is constructing his Plots, and engaged on the  Diction in which they are worked out, the poet should remember (1) to  put the actual scenes as far as possible before his eyes. In this way,  seeing everything with the vividness of an eye-witness as it were,  he will devise what is appropriate, and be least likely to overlook  incongruities. This is shown by what was censured in Carcinus, the  return of Amphiaraus from the sanctuary; it would have passed unnoticed,  if it had not been actually seen by the audience; but on the stage his  play failed, the incongruity of the incident offending the spectators.  (2) As far as may be, too, the poet should even act his story with the  very gestures of his personages. Given the same natural qualifications,  he who feels the emotions to be described will be the most convincing;  distress and anger, for instance, are portrayed most truthfully by one  who is feeling them at the moment. Hence it is that poetry demands a man  with special gift for it, or else one with a touch of madness in him;  the former can easily assume the required mood, and the latter may  be actually beside himself with emotion. (3) His story, again, whether  already made or of his own making, he should first simplify and reduce  to a universal form, before proceeding to lengthen it out by the  insertion of episodes. The following will show how the universal element  in _Iphigenia_, for instance, may be viewed: A certain maiden having  been offered in sacrifice, and spirited away from her sacrificers into  another land, where the custom was to sacrifice all strangers to the  Goddess, she was made there the priestess of this rite. Long after that  the brother of the priestess happened to come; the fact, however, of the  oracle having for a certain reason bidden him go thither, and his  object in going, are outside the Plot of the play. On his coming he  was arrested, and about to be sacrificed, when he revealed who he  was--either as Euripides puts it, or (as suggested by Polyidus) by the  not improbable exclamation, 'So I too am doomed to be sacrificed, as  my sister was'; and the disclosure led to his salvation. This done, the  next thing, after the proper names have been fixed as a basis for the  story, is to work in episodes or accessory incidents. One must mind,  however, that the episodes are appropriate, like the fit of madness in  Orestes, which led to his arrest, and the purifying, which brought about  his salvation. In plays, then, the episodes are short; in epic poetry  they serve to lengthen out the poem. The argument of the _Odyssey_ is  not a long one.    A certain man has been abroad many years; Poseidon is ever on the watch  for him, and he is all alone. Matters at home too have come to this,  that his substance is being wasted and his son's death plotted by  suitors to his wife. Then he arrives there himself after his grievous  sufferings; reveals himself, and falls on his enemies; and the end is  his salvation and their death. This being all that is proper to the  _Odyssey_, everything else in it is episode.          18      (4) There is a further point to be borne in mind. Every tragedy is  in part Complication and in part Denouement; the incidents before the  opening scene, and often certain also of those within the play, forming  the Complication; and the rest the Denouement. By Complication I mean  all from the beginning of the story to the point just before the change  in the hero's fortunes; by Denouement, all from the beginning of the  change to the end. In the _Lynceus_ of Theodectes, for instance, the"]]]
