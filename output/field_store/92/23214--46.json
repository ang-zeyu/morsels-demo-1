Then a ship shall come from  thy land with sailors, and thou shalt leave with them and go to thy  country, and thou shalt die in thy town.    '\"Converse is pleasing, and he who tastes of it passes over his  misery.  I will therefore tell thee of that which is in this isle. I  am here with my brethren and my children around me; we are  seventy-five serpents, children, and kindred; without naming a young  girl who was brought unto me by chance, and on whom the fire of heaven  fell, and burnt her to ashes.    \"'As for thee if thou art strong, and if thy heart waits patiently, thou  shalt press thy infants to thy bosom and embrace thy wife. Thou shalt  return to thy house which is full of all good things, thou shalt see thy  land, where thou shalt dwell in the midst of thy kindred.'    \"Then I bowed, in my obeisance, and I touched the ground before him.  'Behold now that which I have told thee before. I shall tell of thy  presence unto Pharaoh, I shall make him to know of thy greatness, and I  will bring to thee of the sacred oils and perfumes, and of incense of  the temples with which all gods are honoured. I shall tell, moreover, of  that which I do now see (thanks to him), and there shall be rendered  to thee praises before the fulness of all the land. I shall slay asses  for thee in sacrifice, I shall pluck for thee the birds, and I shall  bring for thee ships full of all kinds of the treasures of Egypt, as  is comely to do unto a god, a friend of men in a far country, of which  men know not.'    \"Then he smiled at my speech, because of that which was in his heart,  for he said to me, 'Thou art not rich in perfumes, for all that thou  hast is but common incense. As for me I am prince of the land of Punt,  and I have perfumes. Only the oil which thou sayedst thou wouldest bring  is not common in this isle. But, when thou shalt depart from this place,  thou shalt never more see this isle; it shall be changed into waves.'    \"And, behold, when the ship drew near, according to all that he had told  me before, I got me up into an high tree, to strive to see those who  were within it. Then I came and told to him this matter; but it was already  known unto him before. Then he said to me. 'Farewell, farewell, go to  thy house, little one, see again thy children, and let thy name be good  in thy town; these are my wishes for thee.'\"          THE FAREWELL      \"Then I bowed myself before him, and held my arms low before him, and  he, he gave me gifts of precious perfumes, of cassia, of sweet woods, of  kohl, of cypress, an abundance of incense, of ivory tusks, of baboons,  of apes, and all kind of precious things. I embarked all in the ship  which was come, and bowing myself, I prayed God for him.    \"Then he said to me, 'Behold thou shalt come to thy country in two  months, thou shalt press to thy bosom thy children, and thou shalt rest  in thy tomb.' After this I went down to the shore unto the ship, and I  called to the sailors who were there. Then on the shore I rendered  adoration to the master of this isle and to those who dwelt therein.    \"When we shall come, in our return, to the house of Pharaoh, in the  second month, according to all that the serpent has said, we shall  approach unto the palace. And I shall go in before Pharaoh, I shall  bring the gifts which I have brought from this isle into the country.  Then he shall thank me before the fulness of all the land. Grant then  unto me a follower, and lead me to the courtiers of the king. Cast thy  eye upon me, after that I am come to land again, after that I have  both seen and proved this. Hear my prayer, for it is good to listen to  people. It was said unto me, 'Become a wise man, and thou shalt come  to honour,' and behold I have become such.\"    This is finished from its beginning unto its end, even as it was found  in a writing. It is written by the scribe of cunning fingers  Ameni-amen-aa; may he live in life, wealth, and health!          Remarks      This tale is only known in one copy, preserved in the Hermitage  collection at St. Petersburg. The papyrus has not yet been published,  either in facsimile or transcription. But two translations of it have  appeared by M. Golenischeff: from the earlier a modified translation is  given by Maspero in the \"Contes Populaires,\" 2nd edit., pp. 133-146,  and the later translation is in M. Golenischeff's excellent  \"Inventaire de la collection Egyptienne (Ermitage Imperial),\" p.  177-182.    The tale is that of a returned sailor, speaking to his superior and  telling his adventures, to induce him to send him on with an  introduction to the king. At first his master professes to disbelieve  him, and then the sailor protests that this happened to himself, and  gives his narrative. The idea of an enchanted island, which has risen  from the waves and will sink again, is here found to be one of the  oldest plots for a tale of marvels. But the construction is far more  advanced than that of the tales of the magicians. The family of serpents  and the manner of the great serpent is well conceived, and there are  many fine touches of literary quality: such as noise as of thunder, the  trees shaking and the earth being moved at the appearance of the great  serpent--the speeches of the serpent and his threat--the sailors who had  seen heaven and earth--the contempt of the serpent for his offerings.    \"As for me, I am prince of the land of Punt, and I have perfumes\"--and  the scene of departure. All of these points show a firm hand and  practised taste, although there is still a style of simplicity clinging  to it which agrees well to its date in the XIIth Dynasty.    The great serpent is not of a type usual in Egyptian designs. The  human-headed uraeus is seldom bearded; and the best example of such a  monster is on an Ethiopian temple, where a great uraeus has human arms  and a lion's head. The colours again repeat the favourite combination  expressive of splendour--gold and lazuli. Though lazuli is very rare in  early times, yet it certainly was known in the XIIth Dynasty, as shown  by the forms of some beads of lazuli.    The slaughter of asses in sacrifice is a very peculiar offering, and no  sign of this is found in any representations or groups of offerings.    The colophon of the copyist at the end shows by the style of the name  that it belongs to the earlier part of the XIIth Dynasty, and if so, the  composition might be referred to the opening of foreign trade under  Sankhkara or Amenemhat I.          XIITH DYNASTY          THE ADVENTURES OF SANEHAT      The hereditary prince, royal seal-bearer, confidential friend, judge,  keeper of the gate of the foreigners, true and beloved royal  acquaintance, the royal follower Sanehat says:--    I attended my lord as a follower of the king, of the house of the  hereditary princess, the greatly favoured, the royal wife,  Ankhet-Usertesen, who shares the dwelling of the royal son Amenemhat in  Kanefer.    In the thirtieth year, the month Paophi, the seventh day the god entered  his horizon, the king Sehotepabra flew up to heaven and joined the sun's  disc, the follower of the god met his maker. The palace was silenced,  and in mourning, the great gates were closed, the courtiers crouching  on the ground, the people in hushed mourning.    His majesty had sent a great army with the nobles to the land of the  Temehu (Lybia), his son and heir, the good god king Usertesen as their  leader. Now he was returning, and had brought away living captives and  all kinds of cattle without end. The councillors of the palace had sent  to the West to let the king know the matter that had come to pass in the  inner hall. The messenger was to meet him on the road, and reach him at  the time of evening: the matter was urgent. \"A hawk had soared with his  followers.\" Thus said he, not to let the army know of it Even if the  royal sons who commanded in that army send a message, he was not to  speak to a single one of them. But I was standing near, and heard his  voice while he was speaking. I fled far away, my heart beating, my arms  failing, trembling had fallen on all my limbs. I turned about in running  to seek a place to hide me, and I threw myself between two bushes, to  wait while they should pass by.          THE FLIGHT      Then I turned me toward the south, not from wishing to come into this  palace--for I knew not if war was declared--nor even thinking a wish to  live after this sovereign.    I turned my back to the sycamore, I reached Shi-Seneferu, and rested on  the open field. In the morning I went on and overtook a man, who passed  by the edge of the road. He asked of me mercy, for he feared me. By  the evening I drew near to Kher-ahau (? old Cairo), and I crossed the  river on a raft without a rudder. Carried over by the west wind, I  passed over to the east to the quarries of Aku and the land of the  goddess Herit, mistress of the red mountain (Gebel Ahmar). Then I fled  on foot, northward, and reached the walls of the prince, built to  repel the Sati.  I crouched in a bush for fear of being seen by the  guards, changed each day, who watch on the top of the fortress. I took  my way by night, and at the lighting or the day I reached Peten, and  turned me toward the valley of Kemur. Then thirst hasted me on; I  dried up, and my throat narrowed, and I said, \"This is the taste of  death.\" When I lifted up my heart and gathered strength, I heard a  voice and the lowing of cattle. I saw men of the Sati, and one of  them--a friend unto Egypt--knew me. Behold he gave me water and boiled  me milk, and I went with him to his camp; they did me good, and one  tribe passed me on to another. I passed on to Sun, and reached the  land of Adim (Edom).    When I had dwelt there half a year Amu-an-shi--who is the prince of the  Upper Tenu--sent for me and said: \"Dwell thou with me that thou mayest  hear the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#7)"],[1,"of yourselves, to  see the last of these _uncouth_ garments.\" I could not help putting  a little vicious emphasis on that hateful word.    He inclined his head and said, \"Yes?\"    Thus encouraged, I dashed boldly into the middle of matter; for now,  having dined, albeit without wine, I was inflamed with an intense  craving to see myself arrayed in their rich, mysterious dress. \"This  being so,\" I continued, \"may I ask you if it is in your power to provide  me with the necessary garments, so that I may cease to be an object of  aversion and offense to every living thing and person, myself included?\"    A long and uncomfortable silence ensued, which was perhaps not strange,  considering the nature of the request. That I had blundered once more  seemed likely enough, from the general suspense and the somewhat alarmed  expression of the old gentleman's countenance; nevertheless, my motives  had been good: I had expressed my wish in that way for the sake of peace  and quietness, and fearing that if I had asked to be directed to the  nearest clothing establishment, a new fit of amazement would have been  the result.    Finding the silence intolerable, I at length ventured to remark that I  feared he had not understood me to the end.    \"Perhaps not,\" he answered gravely. \"Or, rather let me say, I hope not.\"    \"May I explain my meaning?\" said I, greatly distressed.    \"Assuredly you may,\" he replied with dignity. \"Only before you speak,  let me put this plain question to you: Do you ask us to provide you with  garments--that is to say, to bestow them as a gift on you?\"    \"Certainly not!\" I exclaimed, turning crimson with shame to think that  they were all taking me for a beggar. \"My wish is to obtain them somehow  from somebody, since I cannot make them for myself, and to give in  return their full value.\"    I had no sooner spoken than I greatly feared that I had made matters  worse; for here was I, a guest in the house, actually offering to  purchase clothing--ready-made or to to order--from my host, who, for all  I knew, might be one of the aristocracy of the country. My fears,  however, proved quite groundless.    \"I am glad to hear your explanation,\" he answered, \"for it has  completely removed the unpleasant impression caused by your former  words. What can you do in return for the garments you are anxious to  possess? And here, let me remark, I approve highly of your wish to  escape, with the least possible delay, from your present covering. Do  you wish to confine yourself to the finishing of some work in a  particular line--as wood-carving, or stone, metal, clay or glass work;  or in making or using colors? or have you only that general knowledge of  the various arts which would enable you to assist the more skilled in  preparing materials?\"    \"No, I am not an artist,\" I replied, surprised at his question. \"All I  can do is to buy the clothes--to pay for them in money.\"    \"What do you mean by that? What is money?\"    \"Surely----\" I began, but fortunately checked myself in time, for I had  meant to suggest that he was pulling my leg. But it was really hard to  believe that a person of his years did not know what money was. Besides,  I could not answer the question, having always abhorred the study of  political economy, which tells you all about it; so that I had never  learned to define money, but only how to spend it. Presently I thought  the best way out of the muddle was to show him some, and I accordingly  pulled out my big leather book-purse from my breast pocket. It had an  ancient, musty smell, like everything else about me, but seemed pretty  heavy and well-filled, and I proceeded to open it and turn the contents  on the table. Eleven bright sovereigns and three half-crowns or florins,  I forget which, rolled out; then, unfolding the papers, I discovered  three five-pound Bank of England notes.    \"Surely this is very little for me to have about me!\" said I, feeling  greatly disappointed. \"I fancy I must have been making ducks and drakes  of a lot of cash before--before--well, before I was--I don't know what,  or when, or where.\"    Little notice was taken of this somewhat incoherent speech, for all were  now gathering round the table, examining the gold and notes with eager  curiosity. At length the old gentleman, pointing to the gold pieces,  said: \"What are these?\"    \"Sovereigns,\" I answered, not a little amused. \"Have you never seen any  like them before?\"    \"Never. Let me examine them again. Yes, these eleven are of gold. They  are all marked alike, on one side with a roughly-executed figure of a  woman's head, with the hair gathered on its summit in a kind of ball.  There are also other things on them which I do not understand.\"    \"Can you not read the letters?\" I asked.    \"No. The letters--if these marks are letters--are incomprehensible to  me. But what have these small pieces of metal to do with the question of  your garments? You puzzle me.\"    \"Why, everything. These pieces of metal, as you call them, are money,  and represent, of course, so much buying power. I don't know yet what  your currency is, and whether you have the dollar or the rupee\"--here I  paused, seeing that he did not follow me. \"My idea is this,\" I resumed,  and coming down to very plain speaking: \"I can give one of these  five-pound notes, or its equivalent in gold, if you prefer that--five of  these sovereigns, I mean--for a suit of clothes such as you all wear.\"    So great was my desire to possess the clothes that I was about to double  the offer, which struck me as poor, and add that I would give ten  sovereigns; but when I had spoken he dropped the piece he held in his  hand upon the table, and stared fixedly at me, assisted by all the  others. Presently, in the profound silence which ensued, a low, silvery  gurgling became audible, as of some merry mountain burn--a sweet,  warbling sound, swelling louder by degrees until it ended in a long  ringing peal of laughter.    This was from the girl Yoletta. I stared at her, surprised at her  unseasonable levity; but the only effect of my doing so was a general  explosion, men and women joining in such a tempest of merriment that one  might have imagined they had just heard the most wonderful joke ever  invented since man acquired the sense of the ludicrous.    The old gentleman was the first to recover a decent gravity, although it  was plain to see that he struggled severely at intervals to prevent a  relapse.    \"Smith,\" said he, \"of all the extraordinary delusions you appear to be  suffering from, this, that you can have garments to wear in return for a  small piece of paper, or for a few bits of this metal, is the most  astounding! You cannot exchange these trifles for clothes, because  clothes are the fruit of much labor of many hands.\"    \"And yet, sir, you said you understood me when I proposed to pay for the  things I require,\" said I, in an aggrieved tone. \"You seemed even to  approve of the offer I made. How, then, am I to pay for them if all I  possess is not considered of any value?\"    \"_All_ you possess!\" he replied. \"Surely I did not say that! Surely  you possess the strength and skill common to all men, and can acquire  anything you wish by the labor of your hands.\"    I began once more to see light, although my skill, I knew, would not  count for much. \"Ah yes,\" I answered: \"to go back to that subject, I do  not know anything about wood-carving or using colors, but I might be  able to do something--some work of a simpler kind.\"    \"There are trees to be felled, land to be plowed, and many other things  to be done. If you will do these things some one else will be released  to perform works of skill; and as these are the most agreeable to the  worker, it would please us more to have you labor in the fields than in  the workhouse.\"    \"I am strong,\" I answered, \"and will gladly undertake labor of the kind  you speak of. There is, however, one difficulty. My desire is to change  these clothes for others which will be more pleasing to the eye, at  once; but the work I shall have to do in return will not be finished in  a day. Perhaps not in--well, several days.\"    \"No, of course not,\" said he. \"A year's labor will be necessary to pay  for the garments you require.\"    This staggered me; for if the clothes were given to me at the beginning,  then before the end of the year they would be worn to rags, and I should  make myself a slave for life. I was sorely perplexed in mind, and pulled  about this way and that by the fear of incurring a debt, and the desire  to see myself (and to be seen by Yoletta) in those strangely fascinating  garments. That I had a decent figure, and was not a bad-looking young  fellow, I was pretty sure; and the hope that I should be able to create  an impression (favorable, I mean) on the heart of that supremely  beautiful girl was very strong in me. At all events, by closing with the  offer I should have a year of happiness in her society, and a year of  healthy work in the fields could not hurt me, or interfere much with my  prospects. Besides, I was not quite sure that my prospects were really  worth thinking about just now. Certainly, I had always lived  comfortably, spending money, eating and drinking of the best, and  dressing well--that is, according to the London standard. And there was  my dear old bachelor Uncle Jack--John Smith, Member of Parliament for  Wormwood Scrubbs. That is to say, ex-Member; for, being a Liberal when  the great change came at the last general election, he was ignominiously  ousted from his seat, the Scrubbs proving at the finish a bitter place  to him. He was put out in more ways than one, and tried to comfort  himself by saying that there would soon be another dissolution--thinking  of his own, possibly, being an old man. I remembered that I had rather  looked forward to such a contingency, thinking how pleasant it would be  to have all that money, and cruise about the world in my own"]]]
