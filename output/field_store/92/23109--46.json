If a man has a wife whom he desires to treat indulgently, he does not  necessarily open a joint account with her at his bankers.    If he wants to contribute to a charity he does not give to the  managers of that charity a power of attorney over his property.    And if he is a philanthropical director of a great business he does  not, when a pathetic case of poverty among his staff is brought to his  notice, imperil the fortunes of his undertaking by giving to his  workmen shares and a vote in the management.    Moreover, he would perhaps regard it as a little suspect if a group of  those who were claiming this as a right came and told him that \"it was  very _selfish_ of him\" not to grant their request.    Precious above rubies to the suffragist and every other woman who  wants to apply the screw to man is that word _selfish_. It furnishes  her with the _petitio principii_ that man is under an ethical  obligation to give anything she chooses to ask.    We come next--and this is the last of all the arguments we have to  consider--to the argument that the suffrage ought to be given to woman  for instructional purposes.    Now it would be futile to attempt to deny that we have ready to hand  in the politics of the British Empire--that Empire which is swept  along in \"the too vast orb of her fate\"--an ideal political  training-ground in which we might put woman to school. The woman voter  would there be able to make any experiment she liked.    But one wonders why it has not been proposed to carry woman's  instruction further, and for instructional purposes to make of a woman  let us say a judge, or an ambassador, or a Prime Minister.    There would--if only it were legitimate to sacrifice vital national  interests--be not a little to say in favour of such a course. One  might at any rate hope by these means once for all to bring home to  man the limitations of woman.      PART II    ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE CONCESSION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SUFFRAGE TO  WOMAN    I    WOMAN'S DISABILITY IN THE MATTER OF PHYSICAL FORCE    International Position of State would be Imperilled by Woman's  Suffrage--Internal Equilibrium of State would be Imperilled.    The woman suffrage movement has now gone too far to be disposed of by  the overthrow of its arguments, and by a mere indication of those  which could be advanced on the other side. The situation demands the  bringing forward of the case against woman's suffrage; and it must be  the full and quite unexpurgated case.    I shall endeavour to do this in the fewest possible words, and to be  more especially brief where I have to pass again over ground which I  have previously traversed in dealing with the arguments of the  suffragists.    I may begin with what is fundamental. It is an axiom that we should in  legislating guide ourselves directly by considerations of utility and  expediency. For abstract principles--I have in view here _rights,  justice, egalitarian equity, equality, liberty, chivalry, logicality,_  and such like--are not all of them guides to utility; and each of  these is, as we have seen, open to all manner of private  misinterpretation.    Applying the above axiom to the issue before us, it is clear that we  ought to confine ourselves here to the discussion of the question as  to whether the State would, or would not, suffer from the admission of  women to the electorate.    We can arrive at a judgment upon this by considering, on the one hand,  the class-characters of women so far as these may be relevant to the  question of the suffrage; and, on the other hand, the legislative  programmes put forward by the female legislative reformer and the  feminist.    In connexion with the class-characters of woman, it will be well,  before attempting to indicate them, to interpolate here the general  consideration that the practical statesman, who has to deal with  things as they are, is not required to decide whether the characters  of women which will here be considered are, as the physiologist (who  knows that the sexual products influence every tissue of the body)  cannot doubt, \"secondary sexual characters\"; or, as the suffragist  contends, \"acquired characters.\" It will be plain that whether defects  are \"secondary sexual characters\" (and therefore as irremediable as  \"racial characters\"); or whether they are \"acquired characters\" (and  as such theoretically remediable) they are relevant to the question of  the concession of the suffrage just so long as they continue to be  exhibited.[1]    [1] This is a question on which Mill (vide _Subjection of Women_, last  third of Chapter I) has endeavoured to confuse the issues for his  reader, first, by representing that by no possibility can man know  anything of the \"nature,\" _i.e._, of the \"secondary sexual  characters\" of woman; and, secondly, by distracting attention from the  fact that \"acquired characters\" may produce unfitness for the  suffrage.    The primordial argument against giving woman the vote is that that  vote would not represent physical force.    Now it is by physical force alone and by prestige--which represents  physical force in the background--that a nation protects itself  against foreign interference, upholds its rule over subject  populations, and enforces its own laws. And nothing could in the end  more certainly lead to war and revolt than the decline of the military  spirit and loss of prestige which would inevitably follow if man  admitted woman into political co-partnership.    While it is arguable that such a partnership with woman in government  as obtains in Australia and New Zealand is sufficiently unreal to be  endurable, there cannot be two opinions on the question that a virile  and imperial race will not brook any attempt at forcible control by  women.    Again, no military foreign nation or native race would ever believe in  the stamina and firmness of purpose of any nation that submitted even  to the semblance of such control.    The internal equilibrium of the State also would be endangered by the  admission to the register of millions of electors whose vote would not  be endorsed by the authority of physical force.    Regarded  from this point of view a Woman's Suffrage measure stands on  an absolutely different basis to any other extension of the suffrage.  An extension which takes in more men--whatever else it may do--makes  for stability in the respect that it makes the decrees of the  legislature more irresistible. An extension which takes in any women  undermines the physical sanction of the laws.    We can see indications of the evil that would follow such an event in  the profound dissatisfaction which is felt when--in violation of the  democratic principle that every man shall count for one, and no man  for more than one--the political wishes of the large constituencies  which return relatively few members to Parliament, are overborne by  those of constituencies which, with a smaller aggregate population,  return more members.    And we see what such evil finally culminates in when the  over-representation of one part of a country and the corresponding  under-representation of other portions has led a large section of the  people to pledge themselves to disregard the eventual ordinances of  Parliament.    If ever the question as to whether the will of Ulster or that of the  Nationalists is to prevail is brought to the arbitrament of physical  force, it will be due to the inequalities of parliamentary  representation as between England and Ireland, and as between the  Unionist and Nationalist population of Ulster.    The general lesson that all governmental action ought to be backed by  force, is further brought home to the conscience when we take note of  the fact that every one feels that public morality is affronted when  senile, infirm, and bedridden men are brought to the poll to turn the  scale in hotly contested elections.    For electoral decisions are felt to have moral prestige only when the  electoral figures quantitatively represent the physical forces which  are engaged on either side. And where vital interests are involved, no  class of men can be expected to accept any decision other than one  which rests upon the _ultima ratio_.    Now all the evils which are the outcome of disparities between the  parliamentary power and the organised physical force of contending  parties would \"grow\" a hundredfold if women were admitted to the  suffrage.    There would after that be no electoral or parliamentary decision which  would not be open to challenge on the ground that it was impossible to  tell whether the party which came out the winner had a majority which  could enforce its will, or only a majority obtained by the inclusion  of women. And no measure of redistribution could ever set that right.    There may find place here also the consideration that the voting of  women would be an unsettling element in the government of the State,  forasmuch as they would, by reason of a general lack of interest in  public affairs, only very; seldom come to the poll: would, in fact,  come to the poll in full strength only when some special appeal had  come home to their emotions.    Now an electorate which includes a very large proportion of quite  uninterested voters would be in the same case as a legislature which  included a very large proportion of members who made a practice of  staying away. It would be in the same case, because the absentees, who  would not have acquired the training which comes from consecutive  attention to public affairs, might at any moment step in and upset the  stability of State by voting for some quite unconsidered measure.    Coming back in conclusion to our main issue, I would re-emphasise an  aspect of the question upon which I have already elsewhere insisted.[1]  I have in view the fact that woman does, and should, stand to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#7)"],[1,"at the lobe of my left ear, a habit of mine  when confused which has always irritated my Dorothy.    \"There!\" Virginia said finally, \"that's it!\"    Her voice had a note of finality with a touch of total triumph that I  found disturbing.    \"Well, have you anything to say?\" I asked.    \"Have _you_ anything to say?\"    \"I've already said it, Virginia. Nice as you are and beautiful as you  are, we're washed up. It won't work and we both know it. So why not  shake hands and quit friends?\"    She took my proffered hand in hers but, instead of shaking it, examined  it carefully.    \"Very clever,\" she murmured. \"You've even got that little mole at the  base of your thumb.\"    \"Of course I have. It's been there since birth.\"    \"Very, _very_, clever, Winnie,\" she continued, \"but it won't do, my  Winnie, because you see you aren't my Winnie at all. You're a total  stranger.\"    \"I've changed,\" I admitted. \"I'm trying to be half-way decent.\"    \"Whoever wanted Winnie to be half-way decent?\" she mused. \"Nobody.  He was much pleasanter as he was--a rich, friendly boob. As for you,  whoever you are, I'm on to your game. You aren't Winfred Tompkins and  you know it.\"    I put some heavy sarcasm into my reply. \"How did you ever guess, Mrs.  Rutherford?\"    She laughed airily, helped herself to a cigarette and leaned forward  while I lighted it so that I could not help seeing deep into the  straining V of her blouse.    \"Lots of things. In the first place, you call me 'Virginia' when we're  alone instead of 'Bozo' as you always used to do.\"    \"I stopped calling you 'Bozo' when I made up my mind--\" I began.    \"Nuts to you, Buddy,\" she rejoined. \"Then you kept pulling at your ear  as though you were milking a cow, while I was needling you. Winnie  never did that. When he was in a spot, he always reached in his pocket  and jingled his change or, as a desperate measure, twiddled his keys.\"    \"Don't judge my habits by my hang-overs,\" I insisted. \"I'm not feeling  well and I've had a sort of psychic shock.\"    \"Winnie never said 'psychic' in his life, poor lamb,\" she observed. \"He  didn't know what it meant. No, I don't know what your game is but I'm  on to you and we're going to be real buddies from now on or--\"    \"Or what?\"    \"The police,\" she observed quietly, \"take a dim view of murder in this  state. Now I'm willing to be broad-minded. Winnie was a louse who had  it coming to him, I guess. I was playing him for a quick divorce and  marriage. Three million dollars is a lot of money, even in these days,  and it would have been nice to have been married to it. But it's even  nicer this way, I guess.\"    The decanter was within reach. I poured myself another drink. \"Have  some?\" I asked.    \"And why not? What's yours is mine, and we both need it.\"    \"Why did you say it was nicer this way, Mrs. Rutherford?\" I inquired.    \"Virginia to you, Winnie. It's because now I don't have to marry you  and I still have a pipe-line to the Tompkins millions.\"    \"So you _are_ going in for blackmail,\" I observed. \"Suppose I  threatened to divorce Jimmie and marry you. After all, I still could.\"    \"A girl has her pride,\" she murmured. \"Not that I'd mind having fun  with you, Winnie--as I think I'd better call you. But a wife can't give  testimony against her husband and I think I'd rather like to be able to  give testimony if needed. Besides, a husband has too many opportunities  to help the undertaker. There are accidents in bath-tubs and garages,  medicines get mixed up in the bathroom cabinet and there is always the  old-fashioned hatchet. No, since you've managed to get rid of the other  Winnie, somehow, I think I'll keep a safe distance and my silence, as  long as you make it worth my while.\"    \"Suppose I won't play?\" I suggested.    \"Then I'll go to the police or the F.B.I.--they're supposed to catch  kidnappers, aren't they?--and tell them what I know.\"    I stood up. This would be easier than I had expected.    \"Okay, Virginia,\" I said, \"go right ahead. There's the telephone. You  can use it to call the Secret Service for all I care. See what luck you  have with your story, when my wife is here to testify that I'm Winnie  Tompkins.\"    Her face paled and her eyes narrowed angrily. \"Jimmie too?\" she asked.  \"Then you're both in it!\"    \"We're both in what?\"    The door opened and Germaine Tompkins stood in the entrance.    Virginia Rutherford looked trapped and she instinctively pulled her  mink back over her shoulders.    \"Nothing, Jimmie,\" she said at last. \"I was foolish enough to hope that  if I came back and had a talk alone with Winnie, we could pick up  where we left off. He's been acting so strangely that he doesn't seem  like himself at all. And so are you. That's what I meant by saying that  you were both in it.\"    \"Virginia,\" my wife said firmly, \"my husband told you to stay out of  this house--and it's my home, too--and now I find you here. Please go  or I'll call the police.\"    The two women exchanged appraising glances which suggested that they  were both thoroughly enjoying the touch of melodrama that had come into  their well-fed lives.    \"No, it's my fault for letting her in,\" I said. \"She sent in word by  Mary--\"    \"You mean Myrtle.\"    \"--that she would like to see me. I agreed to do so, so you can't blame  her. We talked things over and decided that it's all off--a few moments  of madness, but that's all, and not worth wrecking two marriages for.  Isn't that so, Mrs. Rutherford?\"    Virginia shook her head. \"No, Winnie, it is not so. Jimmie, I came here  with that gun. It wasn't loaded but the next time it will be. I made  Myrtle or whatever her name is show me in and I told her I would shoot  Winnie if she gave the alarm. Then I told him what I know about him.\"    \"And what is that?\" my wife asked.    \"That he is not Winnie at all,\" Virginia declared. \"That he is an  imposter, that he and perhaps you had done away with poor old Winnie. I  told him that I wouldn't tell his secret if he paid me to keep silent.  And he told me to call the police.\"    My wife went over to her and took her hand. \"Poor, darling Virginia,\"  she murmured, \"why don't you go away and have a good rest? You've got  yourself all worked up for a nervous breakdown. Of course it's Winnie.  I'm married to him and I ought to know my own husband, shouldn't I?  You've simply got run down and all, with rationing and war-work. Why  don't you let Jerry send you for a few weeks to the Hartford Sanctuary  for psychoanalysis and a good rest?\"    Virginia dashed my wife's hand away. \"In other words, you think I'm  crazy!\" she snapped.    \"No, but I do think you're hysterical. This is Winnie, I'm Jimmie  and you're Virginia Rutherford. We've all been letting ourselves get  over-emotional and this war is a strain on everybody. Don't worry.  Jerry can fix it for you quite easily and I--we both will be glad  to help pay for it, if you're worried about the money. After all,\"  Germaine added wryly, \"the whole thing is pretty much of a family  affair, isn't it? Let's keep it that way.\"    Mrs. Rutherford reached over and grabbed the gun from the sofa.    \"All right, Germaine Tompkins, murderess,\" she grated. \"If that's the  way you're going to play it, I'll play too. Don't worry about my mind.  Start thinking about the electric chair. Remember, in this state they  execute women who kill their husbands.\"    Jimmie waited until the door closed behind the doctor's wife. Then she  turned to me with a curious expression of weariness.    \"Poor man!\" she remarked. \"You have got yourself into a bad mess,  haven't you?\"    I nodded.    \"It didn't seem like one while I was getting into it,\" I said. \"It's  only now when I'm trying to get things straightened out that it seems  so awful.\"    \"Let's see,\" she continued. \"How many women is it you've been trying to  keep away from each other? There's myself, of course, but wives don't  count any more, do they? And there's Virginia Rutherford and Myrtle,  and there was that blonde actress we met at Martha's Vineyard last  summer, and is it one or two girls at the office?\"    Here was where I could object with complete sincerity. \"I swear that  I've not been fooling with any of the office girls,\" I said.    \"I know,\" Jimmie agreed wisely. \"You always used to tell me that it was  considered bad for business to play with the help but after I saw the  way you went for Myrtle I decided that there were exceptions to every  rule.\"    \"Nobody in the office,\" I repeated. \"I swear it.\"    \"Then perhaps it was the office next door. Maybe you brokers have  an exchange system for taking on each other's stenographers--charge  it to business expenses for getting information about each other's  dealings--but I know I've heard the name Briggs mentioned somehow in  your connection.\"    \"The name means absolutely nothing to me,\" I insisted. \"If it will make  you any happier I'll admit to a hundred women but I'm through with all  that sex-stuff. From now on, I'm going to be a one-woman man.\"    Germaine faced me with an air of resolution. \"Would you mind giving me  a drink of brandy?\" she asked. \"I've something to say to you and I'm  afraid you won't like it.\"    I went to the portable bar and poured her a pony of Courvoisier.    \"Here you are. Down the hatch! And now what is it you want to tell me.\"    \"Believe me, Winnie,\" she said, \"it's not easy for me. But I'd better  say it anyhow. I can't keep on suppressing it. Who _are_ you?\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Who _are_ you?\" she repeated. \"You look like my husband but you don't  talk like him. His clothes fit you but Virginia Rutherford is _quite_  right--you aren't Winnie Tompkins.\"    \"How did you guess?\"    \"Don't think I'll give you away,\" she continued. \"I won't because  you must have had a terribly important reason for doing whatever you  have done. You seem to be in deep trouble of some kind. I--I'd like  to help you, if I can. Don't think I'm hard on my husband. It's been"]]]
