It was originally intended that Banks should again accompany Cook, and  with a view to his better accommodation a poop was added to the  Resolution. The short trip, however, from Deptford to Sheerness proved to  Cook that the ship was dangerously over-weighted, and the poop was  removed, with the consequence that Banks did not sail. The alteration  delayed final departure until June 22nd from Sheerness, and July 13th  from Plymouth.    The naturalists on this voyage were two Forsters, Germans, father and  son; and as astronomers Mr. Wales sailed in the Resolution, and Mr.  Bayley in the Adventure. Two of Cook's former companions sailed as  Lieutenants: Clerke, who was Lieutenant, and Pickersgill, who was master  of the Endeavour when she reached England. This witnesses to the  confidence and enthusiasm that Cook inspired amongst those under him.  There were also other Endeavours amongst the junior officers.    The main object of the voyage was the settlement of the great question of  the southern Continent. Cook was directed to explore the whole region  about the South Pole, starting from the Cape of Good Hope, and working  eastward. The winter of the southern hemisphere was to be employed as  Cook thought fit.    This voyage brought Cook's qualities as a seaman and commander more  prominently to view even than the former. The conditions were very  different. Instead of mapping coasts and islands, the principal duty was  exploration of tempestuous seas in high latitudes, amongst ice, searching  in vain for the illusive southern land.    Cook carried it out thoroughly. No gales, no temperatures deterred him  from searching wherever the ships would safely sail, and it was only ice  in dense masses that turned him back.    What his people thought of it we do not know, but the Forsters have given  a piteous account of the privations and hardships of an exploration that  gave them little chance of exercising their special knowledge.    Cook was better provided with instruments for the determination of  longitude than before, and the ships carried four chronometric  timekeepers; but the proper method of making use of them was scarcely yet  realised, and the course of his voyage did not permit them to be of much  service.    Mindful of his former success in combating scurvy, and making use of his  experience, Cook carried with him all his former anti-scorbutics, and  redoubled his general precautions as to cleanliness, both of person and  ship. The result was complete immunity from more than symptoms of scurvy.  He was able to say, when he returned, that no man had died not only of  this disease, but of any other, due to the exposures of the voyage. Three  lost by accidents, and one from a complaint contracted before leaving  England, were the sole losses on a voyage lasting three years, and during  which the exposure to heat, cold, rain, and all the hardships of a sea  life was probably never surpassed.    Leaving the Cape on November 22nd, Cook stood at once to the southward,  intending to pass over a spot in latitude 54 degrees South, where in 1739  M. Bouvet sighted land that was generally supposed to be a part of the  Southern Continent, and which he had been especially directed to examine.  Gales, however, drove him from his course, and to this day Bouvet's  Islands (for Cook proved they could be nothing else) are doubtfully shown  upon charts.* (* They were again reported in 1825 by the Sprightly, an  English whaler, but Sir James Ross searched for them in 1840 without  success.) Cook soon got into the ice, and fought with it and gales of  wind, in snow and sleet and fog, working gradually eastwards from the  longitude of the Cape for four months. The ship penetrated to 67 degrees  South at one point, and kept as high a latitude as ice permitted  everywhere, but without discovering any land. Cook found to his great joy  that the ice yielded good fresh water, and replenished his water casks in  this manner, without any fear of falling short. With all his power of  communicating his enthusiasm to others, it may be doubted if they shared  his pleasure at finding that the search in these inclement regions need  not be curtailed from lack of this necessary.    At last, in the longitude of Tasmania, Cook hauled to the northward, and  headed for New Zealand, where, after sailing over eleven thousand miles  since leaving the Cape without once sighting land, he anchored in Dusky  Bay on March 26th, 1774, with the Resolution only, the Adventure having  parted company in thick weather on February 9th. Moving on to Queen  Charlotte's Sound, his old anchorage at the north end of Middle Island,  he found the Adventure there on May 18th. Captain Furneaux had, after  vainly searching for his consort, run for Tasmania, and explored the east  coast. He did not, however, clear up the point for which he states he  visited this coast, namely, whether it joined New Holland or not, as  strong winds from the eastward made him fearful of closing what he  thought was a deep bay, though really the Strait, and he sailed for the  rendezvous in New Zealand under the impression that Tasmania and  Australia were one.    The ships left New Zealand on June 7th, 1773, and, after making a wide  circuit to the south and east in search of land, arrived at Tahiti on  August 16th. A good many of the Adventure's people were ill with scurvy,  and Cook is much puzzled to know the reason why they were attacked while  his own crew were free. He puts it down to the greater trouble he had  taken to make all his men use wild celery and other herbs in New Zealand,  and no doubt this had its effect; but one cannot but suspect that the  constant care on his part to keep the ship clean and sweet below had much  to do with it. The Adventure had the same anti-scorbutics, and Cook  especially mentions that they were in use; but the personal efforts of  the captain in the direction of general sanitary precautions were, we  know, exercised in one case, while we know nothing of the other.    After a month's stay at Tahiti and the Society Islands, where the crews  were much benefited by fresh provisions, the ships sailed for the  Friendly Islands, never visited since Tasrnan's time, and touched at Eoa  and Tongatabu, or, as Tasman had called them, Middleburg and Amsterdam.  These were finally left on October 7th for New Zealand, which was made on  the 21st, and from this day to November 2nd the time was spent in  fruitless endeavours to get into Cook's Strait. Gale succeeded gale--no  uncommon thing here--and in one of them the Adventure parted company  never again to rejoin. Cook anchored in Queen Charlotte's Sound on  November 2nd, and waited until the 25th for his consort in vain. Whilst  here they gained further and indisputable proof of the cannibalistic  tendencies of the Maoris, some of the natives eating human flesh before  them. Cook has been much blamed for permitting this scene, which took  place on board; but there had been so much disputing in England as to the  possibility of the fact, that he could not resist the opportunity of  putting it beyond a doubt.    It was, however, to be shortly proved in a much more horrible manner, for  the Adventure, which only arrived at Queen Charlotte's Sound after the  Resolution left, had a boat's crew attacked, overpowered, and eaten by  the natives. The circumstances were never wholly known, as not a man  escaped; but the cooked remains were found, the natives decamping as the  search-party approached.    Cook sailed south on November 25th, 1773, and was soon again battling  with the ice, into which he pushed as far as was safe with as much  hardihood as if he had still had the second ship with him. He gained the  latitude of 67 degrees south, and worked eastward, searching religiously  for land--which, needless to say, he never found--his ropes frozen, and  sails like, as he says, plates of metal. Whatever the feelings of others  on board were, Cook never flinched from every effort to get south,  penetrating in one place to 71 degrees south, where he was stopped by  dense pack, until he found himself nearly in the longitude of Tierra del  Fuego, when, satisfied that no Southern Continent existed in the Pacific,  he, on February 6th, steered north, to continue exploration in more  genial weather and more profitable latitudes. All this time there was no  scurvy, and very little sickness of any kind; an indisputable proof of  the untiring supervision Cook exercised over the health of his men. The  object of his voyage, so far as the Southern Pacific was concerned, was  now accomplished, and Cook might have rounded Cape Horn, and made for the  Cape of Good Hope, completing his tour of the world in southern  latitudes; but such was not his idea of his duty. His own nervous words  will explain his feelings best:--    \"We undoubtedly might have reached the Cape of Good Hope in April, and so  have put an end to the expedition so far as related to the finding of a  continent, which indeed was the first object of the voyage; but for me at  this time to have quitted this Southern Pacific Ocean with a good ship  expressly sent out on discoveries, a healthy crew, and not in want either  of stores or provisions, would have betrayed not only a want of  perseverance, but of judgment, in supposing the South Pacific Ocean to be  so well explored that nothing remained to be done in it. This, however,  was not my opinion; for, although I had proved there was no continent but  what must lie far to the south, there remained, nevertheless, room for  very large islands in places wholly unexamined, and many of those which  were formerly discovered are but imperfectly explored, and their  situation as imperfectly known. I was, besides, of opinion that my  remaining in this sea some time longer would be productive of  improvements in navigation and geography, as well as other sciences.\"    Cook mentions"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8107"],[0,"The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English (#7)"],[1,"to al,  as Ayer and Skie. When thei gaped not for honour, ne hunted after richesse,  but eche man contented with a litle, passed his daies in the wilde fielde,  vnder the open heauen, the couerte of some shadowie Tree, or slendre  houelle, with suche companion or companions as siemed them good, their  diere babes and children aboute them. Sounde without carcke and in rest  full quietnesse, eatyng the fruictes of the fielde, and the milke of the  cattle, and drinking the waters of the christalline springes. First clad  with the softe barcke of trees, or the faire broade leaues, and in processe  with rawe felle and hide full vnworkemanly patched together. Not then  enuironed with walles, ne pente vp with rampers, and diches of deapthe, but  walking at free scope emong the wanderyng beastes of the fielde, and where  the night came vpon theim, there takyng their lodgyng without feare of  murtherer or thief. Mery at the fulle, as without knowledge of the euilles  that aftre ensued as the worlde waxed elder, through diuers desires, and  contrarie endeuours of menne. Who in processe for the insufficience of the  fruictes of the earthe, (whiche she tho gaue vntilled) and for default of  other thynges, ganne falle at disquiete and debate emong themselues, and to  auoied the inuasion of beastes, and menne of straunge borders, (whom by  themselues thei could not repelle) gathered into companies, with commune  aide to withstande suche encursions and violence of wrong. And so ioyning  in confederacie, planted themselues together in a plotte, assigned their  boundes, framed vp cotages, one by anothers chieque, diked in themselues,  chose officers and gouernours and deuised lawes, that thei also emong  theimselues might liue in quiete. So beginning a rough paterne of tounes  and of Cities, that aftre ware laboured to more curious finesse.    And now ware thei not contented, with the commodities of the fieldes and  cattle alone, but by diuers inuencions of handecraftes and sciences, and by  sondrie labours of this life, thei sought how to winne. Now gan thei  tattempte the sease with many deuices, to transplante their progenie and  ofspring into places, vnenhabited, and to enioye the commodities of eche  others countrie, by mutuall traffique. Now came the Oxe to the yoke, the  Horse to the draught, the Metalle to the stampe, the Apparel to  handsomenes, the Speache to more finesse, the Behauiour of menne to a more  calmenesse, the Fare more deintie, the Buildyng more gorgeous,  thenhabitours ouer all became milder and wittier, shaking of (euen of their  owne accorde) the bruteshe outrages and stearne dealinges, that shamefully  mought be spoken of. Nowe refrained thei from sleayng one of a nother, from  eatyng of ech others flesh, from rape and open defiling of mother, sister,  and daughter indifferently, and fro many like abominacions to nature and  honestie. Thei now marieng reason, with strength: and pollicie, with might:  where the earthe was before forgrowen with bushes and wooddes, stuffed with  many noisome beastes, drouned with meares, and with marshe, vnfitte to be  enhabited, waast and vnhandsome in euery condition: by wittie diligence,  and labour, ridde it from encombraunce, planed the roughes, digged vp trees  by the rootes, dried away the superfluous waters, brought all into  leauelle, banished barreinesse, and vncouered the face of the earth, that  it might fully be sene, conuerted the champeine to tillage, the plaines to  pasture, the valley to meadow, the hilles thei shadowed with wooddes and  with Vines, Then thruste thei in cultre and share, and with wide woundes of  the earthe, wan wine and corne plenteously of the grounde, that afore  scarcely gaue them Akornes and Crabbes. Then enhabited thei more thicke,  and spred themselues ouer all, and buylte euery where. Of Tounes, thei made  cities, and of villages, Tounes, Castles vpon the rockes, and in the  valleis made thei the temples of the goddes. The golden graueled springes,  thei encurbed with Marblo, and with trees right pleasauntlie shadowed them  aboute. From them they deriued into cities and Tounes, the pure freshe  waters, a great distaunce of, by conduicte of pipes and troughes, and suche  other conueyance. Where nature had hidden the waters, out of sighte, thei  sancke welles of greate deapth, to supplie their lackes. Riuers, and maigne  floudes, whiche afore with vnbrideled violence, oftymes ouerflowed the  neighboured aboute, to the destruction of their cattle, their houses, and  themselues: thei restrained with bancques, and kept them in a course. And  to the ende thei might not onely be vadable, but passed also with drie  foote, thei deuised meanes with piles of Timbre, and arches of stone,  maulgre the rage of their violent streames, to grounde bridges vpon them.  Yea, the rockes of the sea whiche for the daungier of the accesse, thoughte  themselues exempte from the dinte of their hande, when thei perceiued by  experience, thei ware noyous to sailers, with vnspeakeable labour did thei  ouerthrowe and breake into gobettes. Hewed out hauens on euery strond,  enlarged crieques, opened rodes, and digged out herborowes, where their  shippes mighte ride saulfe fro the storme. Finally thei so laboured,  beautified, and perfeighted the earthe, that at this daie compared with the  former naturalle forgrowen wastenesse, it might well sieme not to be that,  but rather the Paradise of pleasure, out of the whiche, the first paternes  of mankinde (Adam and Eue) for the transgression of Goddes precept, ware  driuen.    Men also inuented and founde many wittie sciences, and artes, many  wondrefull workes whiche when by practice of lettres, thei had committed to  bookes, and laied vp for posteritie, their successours so woundered at  their wisedomes, and so reuerenced their loue and endeuours (whiche thei  spied to be meant toward them, and the wealth of those that shuld folow of  them) that thei thought them not blessed enough, with the estate of men  mortalle, but so aduaunced their fame, and wondered at their worthinesse,  that thei wan theim the honour and name of Goddes immortall.    Tho gan the Prince of the worlde, when men so gan to delight in thadournyng  of the worlde, to sowe vpon the good siede, the pestilente Dernell, that as  thei multiplied in nombre, so iniquitie might encrease, to disturbe and  confounde this blessed state.    First, therefore when he had with all kinde of wickedness belimed the  world, he put into their heades, a curious searche of the highest  knowledge, and suche as depended vpon destenie of thynges. And so practised  his pageauntes, by obscure and doubtfully attempted Responcions, and voices  of spirites, that after he had fettred the worlde in the trauers of his  toies, and launced into their hartes a blinde supersticion, and feare: he  trained it whole to a wicked worship of many goddes and Goddesses, that  when he ones had wiped cleane out of mynde the knowledge and honour of one  God euerlastyng, he might practise vpon manne, some notable mischief. Then  sette he vp pilgrimages to deuilles, foreshewers of thynges, that gaue  aduerisemente and answere to demaundes in sondrie wise. In the Isle of  Delphos one, in Euboea another, at Nasamone a thirde, and emong the  Dodonians, the famous okes, whose bowes by the blastes of the winde  resounded to the eare, a maner of aduertisemente of deuellishe delusion. To  the whiche Idolles and Images of deuelles he stirred vp men to do the  honour (Helas) due onely to God.

Afterward, also when Iesus Christe the verie sonne of the almightie father,  shewyng hymself in the fleshe of our mortalitie, was conuersaunte in the  worlde, pointyng to the same, as with his fingre, the waie to immortalitie,  and endelesse blessednesse, and bothe with woorde and example, exhorted and  allured them to vprightnes of life, to the glorie of his father, sendyng  his disciples and scolers into the vniuersall worlde, to condemne  Superstition and all errour of wickednes, with the moste healthsome woorde:  to plante true Religion, and geue newe preceptes, and directions of the  life, and had now set the matier in suche forwardnesse and poincte, that  the Gospell beyng generally of all nacions receiued, there lacked but  continuaunce to perfeicte felicitie: The deuell eftesones retournyng to his  naturall malice, desirous to repossesse that, that constrainedly he  forsooke, betrappyng again the curious conceipte of man, some he reuersed  into their former abuses and errours, and some with newe Heresies he so  corrupted, snarled, and blynded, that it had bene muche bettre for them,  neuer almoste to haue knowen the waie of truthe, then after their  entraunce, so rashely and maliciously to haue forsaken it.
