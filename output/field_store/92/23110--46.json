No one entered, but after a pause came another rapping.    Claus jumped up and threw open the door.  Before him stood a small girl  holding a smaller brother fast by the hand.    \"Is you Tlaus?\" she asked, shyly.    \"Indeed I am, my dear!\" he answered, with a laugh, as he caught both  children in his arms and kissed them.  \"You are very welcome, and you  have come just in time to share my dinner.\"    He took them to the table and fed them with fresh milk and nut-cakes.  When they had eaten enough he asked:    \"Why have you made this long journey to see me?\"    \"I wants a tat!\" replied little Mayrie; and her brother, who had not  yet learned to speak many words, nodded his head and exclaimed like an  echo: \"Tat!\"    \"Oh, you want my toy cats, do you?\" returned Claus, greatly pleased to  discover that his creations were so popular with children.    The little visitors nodded eagerly.    \"Unfortunately,\" he continued, \"I have but one cat now ready, for I  carried two to children in the town yesterday.  And the one I have  shall be given to your brother, Mayrie, because he is the smaller; and  the next one I make shall be for you.\"    The boy's face was bright with smiles as he took the precious toy Claus  held out to him; but little Mayrie covered her face with her arm and  began to sob grievously.    \"I--I--I wants a t--t--tat now!\" she wailed.    Her disappointment made Claus feel miserable for a moment.  Then he  suddenly remembered Shiegra.    \"Don't cry, darling!\" he said, soothingly; \"I have a toy much nicer  than a cat, and you shall have that.\"    He went to the cupboard and drew out the image of the lioness, which he  placed on the table before Mayrie.    The girl raised her arm and gave one glance at the fierce teeth and  glaring eyes of the beast, and then, uttering a terrified scream, she  rushed from the house.  The boy followed her, also screaming lustily,  and even dropping his precious cat in his fear.    For a moment Claus stood motionless, being puzzled and astonished.  Then he threw Shiegra's image into the cupboard and ran after the  children, calling to them not to be frightened.    Little Mayrie stopped in her flight and her brother clung to her skirt;  but they both cast fearful glances at the house until Claus had assured  them many times that the beast had been locked in the cupboard.    \"Yet why were you frightened at seeing it?\" he asked.  \"It is only a  toy to play with!\"    \"It's bad!\" said Mayrie, decidedly, \"an'--an'--just horrid, an' not a  bit nice, like tats!\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" returned Claus, thoughtfully.  \"But if you  will return with me to the house I will soon make you a pretty cat.\"    So they timidly entered the house again, having faith in their friend's  words; and afterward they had the joy of watching Claus carve out a cat  from a bit of wood and paint it in natural colors.  It did not take him  long to do this, for he had become skillful with his knife by this  time, and Mayrie loved her toy the more dearly because she had seen it  made.    After his little visitors had trotted away on their journey homeward  Claus sat long in deep thought.  And he then decided that such fierce  creatures as his friend the lioness would never do as models from which  to fashion his toys.    \"There must be nothing to frighten the dear babies,\" he reflected; \"and  while I know Shiegra well, and am not afraid of her, it is but natural  that children should look upon her image with terror.  Hereafter I will  choose such mild-mannered animals as squirrels and rabbits and deer and  lambkins from which to carve my toys, for then the little ones will  love rather than fear them.\"    He began his work that very day, and before bedtime had made a wooden  rabbit and a lamb.  They were not quite so lifelike as the cats had  been, because they were formed from memory, while Blinkie had sat very  still for Claus to look at while he worked.    But the new toys pleased the children nevertheless, and the fame of  Claus' playthings quickly spread to every cottage on plain and in  village.  He always carried his gifts to the sick or crippled children,  but those who were strong enough walked to the house in the Valley to  ask for them, so a little path was soon worn from the plain to the door  of the toy-maker's cottage.    First came the children who had been playmates of Claus, before he  began to make toys.  These, you may be sure, were well supplied.  Then  children who lived farther away heard of the wonderful images and made  journeys to the Valley to secure them.  All little ones were welcome,  and never a one went away empty-handed.    This demand for his handiwork kept Claus busily occupied, but he was  quite happy in knowing the pleasure he gave to so many of the dear  children.  His friends the immortals were pleased with his success and  supported him bravely.    The Knooks selected for him clear pieces of soft wood, that his knife  might not be blunted in cutting them; the Ryls kept him supplied with  paints of all colors and brushes fashioned from the tips of timothy  grasses; the Fairies discovered that the workman needed saws and  chisels and hammers and nails, as well as knives, and brought him a  goodly array of such tools.    Claus soon turned his living room into a most wonderful workshop.  He  built a bench before the window, and arranged his tools and paints so  that he could reach everything as he sat on his stool.  And as he  finished toy after toy to delight the hearts of little children he  found himself growing so gay and happy that he could not refrain from  singing and laughing and whistling all the day long.    \"It's because I live in the Laughing Valley, where everything else  laughs!\" said Claus.    But that was not the reason.        5.  How Bessie Blithesome Came to the Laughing Valley    One day, as Claus sat before his door to enjoy the sunshine while he  busily carved the head and horns of a toy deer, he looked up and  discovered a glittering cavalcade of horsemen approaching through the  Valley.    When they drew nearer he saw that the band consisted of a score of  men-at-arms, clad in bright armor and bearing in their hands spears and  battle-axes.  In front of these rode little Bessie Blithesome, the  pretty daughter of that proud Lord of Lerd who had once driven Claus  from his palace.  Her palfrey was pure white, its bridle was covered  with glittering gems, and its saddle draped with cloth of gold, richly  broidered.  The soldiers were sent to protect her from harm while she  journeyed.    Claus was surprised, but he continued to whittle and to sing until the  cavalcade drew up before him.  Then the little girl leaned over the  neck of her palfrey and said:    \"Please, Mr. Claus, I want a toy!\"    Her voice was so pleading that Claus jumped up at once and stood beside  her.  But he was puzzled how to answer her request.    \"You are a rich lord's daughter,\" said he, \"and have all that you  desire.\"    \"Except toys,\" added Bessie.  \"There are no toys in all the world but  yours.\"    \"And I make them for the poor children, who have nothing else to amuse  them,\" continued Claus.    \"Do poor children love to play with toys more than rich ones?\" asked  Bessie.    \"I suppose not,\" said Claus, thoughtfully.    \"Am I to blame because my father is a lord?  Must I be denied the  pretty toys I long for because other children are poorer than I?\" she  inquired earnestly.    \"I'm afraid you must, dear,\" he answered; \"for the poor have nothing  else with which to amuse themselves.  You have your pony to ride, your  servants to wait on you, and every comfort that money can procure.\"    \"But I want toys!\" cried Bessie, wiping away the tears that forced  themselves into her eyes.  \"If I can not have them, I shall be very  unhappy.\"    Claus was troubled, for her grief recalled to him the thought that his  desire was to make all children happy, without regard to their  condition in life.  Yet, while so many poor children were clamoring for  his toys he could not bear to give one to them to Bessie Blithesome,  who had so much already to make her happy.    \"Listen, my child,\" said he, gently; \"all the toys I am now making are  promised to others.  But the next shall be yours, since your heart so  longs for it.  Come to me again in two days and it shall be ready for  you.\"    Bessie gave a cry of delight, and leaning over her pony's neck she  kissed Claus prettily upon his forehead.  Then, calling to her  men-at-arms, she rode gaily away, leaving Claus to resume his work.    \"If I am to supply the rich children as well as the poor ones,\" he  thought, \"I shall not have a spare moment in the whole year!  But is it  right I should give to the rich?  Surely I must go to Necile and talk  with her about this matter.\"    So when he had finished the toy deer, which was very like a deer he had  known in the Forest glades, he walked into Burzee and made his way to  the bower of the beautiful Nymph Necile, who had been his foster mother.    She greeted him tenderly and lovingly, listening with interest to his  story of the visit of Bessie Blithesome.    \"And now tell me,\" said he, \"shall I give toys to rich children?\"    \"We of the Forest know nothing of riches,\" she replied.  \"It seems to  me that one child is like another child, since they are all made of the  same clay, and that riches are like a gown, which may be put on or  taken away, leaving the child unchanged.  But the Fairies are guardians  of mankind, and know mortal children better than I.  Let us call the  Fairy Queen.\"    This was done, and the Queen of the Fairies sat beside them and heard  Claus relate his reasons for thinking the rich children could get along  without his toys, and also what the Nymph had said.    \"Necile is right,\" declared the Queen; \"for, whether it be rich or  poor, a child's longings for pretty playthings are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#7)"],[1,", the sequel,  el papel: conque adelante.              how it all sums up; so lets have it.
