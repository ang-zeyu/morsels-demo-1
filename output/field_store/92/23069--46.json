His ardent  temperament, therefore, was checked by a certain rational or  conventional propriety, so that he was by no means a loose liver, as  many would make him out to be.    We must remember this when we recall the charges that have been made  against Elizabeth, and the strange stories that were told of her  tricks--by no means seemly tricks--which she used to play with her  guardian, Lord Thomas Seymour. The antics she performed with him in her  dressing-room were made the subject of an official inquiry; yet it came  out that while Elizabeth was less than sixteen, and Lord Thomas was  very much her senior, his wife was with him on his visits to the  chamber of the princess.    Sir Robert Tyrwhitt and his wife were also sent to question her,  Tyrwhitt had a keen mind and one well trained to cope with any other's  wit in this sort of cross-examination. Elizabeth was only a girl of  fifteen, yet she was a match for the accomplished courtier in diplomacy  and quick retort. He was sent down to worm out of her everything that  she knew. Threats and flattery and forged letters and false confessions  were tried on her; but they were tried in vain. She would tell nothing  of importance. She denied everything. She sulked, she cried, she  availed herself of a woman's favorite defense in suddenly attacking  those who had attacked her. She brought counter charges against  Tyrwhitt, and put her enemies on their own defense. Not a compromising  word could they wring out of her.    She bitterly complained of the imprisonment of her governess, Mrs.  Ashley, and cried out:    \"I have not so behaved that you need put more mistresses upon me!\"    Altogether, she was too much for Sir Robert, and he was wise enough to  recognize her cleverness.    \"She hath a very good wit,\" said he, shrewdly; \"and nothing is to be  gotten of her except by great policy.\" And he added: \"If I had to say  my fancy, I think it more meet that she should have two governesses  than one.\"    Mr. Hume notes the fact that after the two servants of the princess had  been examined and had told nothing very serious they found that they  had been wise in remaining friends of the royal girl. No sooner had  Elizabeth become queen than she knighted the man Parry and made him  treasurer of the household, while Mrs. Ashley, the governess, was  treated with great consideration. Thus, very naturally, Mr. Hume says:  \"They had probably kept back far more than they told.\"    Even Tyrwhitt believed that there was a secret compact between them,  for he said, quaintly: \"They all sing one song, and she hath set the  note for them.\"    Soon after this her brother Edward's death brought to the throne her  elder sister, Mary, who has harshly become known as Bloody Mary. During  this time Elizabeth put aside her boldness, and became apparently a shy  and simple-minded virgin. Surrounded on every side by those who sought  to trap her, there was nothing in her bearing to make her seem the head  of a party or the young chief of a faction. Nothing could exceed her in  meekness. She spoke of her sister in the humblest terms. She exhibited  no signs of the Tudor animation that was in reality so strong a part of  her character.    But, coming to the throne, she threw away her modesty and brawled and  rioted with very little self-restraint. The people as a whole found  little fault with her. She reminded them of her father, the bluff King  Hal; and even those who criticized her did so only partially. They  thought much better of her than they had of her saturnine sister, the  first Queen Mary.    The life of Elizabeth has been very oddly misunderstood, not so much  for the facts in it as for the manner in which these have been arranged  and the relation which they have to one another. We ought to recollect  that this woman did not live in a restricted sphere, that her life was  not a short one, and that it was crowded with incidents and full of  vivid color. Some think of her as living for a short period of time and  speak of the great historical characters who surrounded her as  belonging to a single epoch. To them she has one set of suitors all the  time--the Duc d'Alencon, the King of Denmark's brother, the Prince of  Sweden, the russian potentate, the archduke sending her sweet messages  from Austria, the melancholy King of Spain, together with a number of  her own brilliant Englishmen--Sir William Pickering, Sir Robert Dudley,  Lord Darnley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Philip Sidney, and Sir Walter  Raleigh.    Of course, as a matter of fact, Elizabeth lived for nearly seventy  years--almost three-quarters of a century--and in that long time there  came and went both men and women, those whom she had used and cast  aside, with others whom she had also treated with gratitude, and who  had died gladly serving her. But through it all there was a continual  change in her environment, though not in her. The young soldier went to  the battle-field and died; the wise counselor gave her his advice, and  she either took it or cared nothing for it. She herself was a curious  blending of forwardness and folly, of wisdom and wantonness, of  frivolity and unbridled fancy. But through it all she loved her people,  even though she often cheated them and made them pay her taxes in the  harsh old way that prevailed before there was any right save the king's  will.    At the same time, this was only by fits and starts, and on the whole  she served them well. Therefore, to most of them she was always the  good Queen Bess. What mattered it to the ditcher and yeoman, far from  the court, that the queen was said to dance in her nightdress and to  swear like a trooper?    It was, indeed, largely from these rustic sources that such stories  were scattered throughout England. Peasants thought them picturesque.  More to the point with them were peace and prosperity throughout the  country, the fact that law was administered with honesty and justice,  and that England was safe from her deadly enemies--the swarthy  Spaniards and the scheming French.    But, as I said, we must remember always that the Elizabeth of one  period was not the Elizabeth of another, and that the England of one  period was not the England of another. As one thinks of it, there is  something wonderful in the almost star-like way in which this girl  flitted unharmed through a thousand perils. Her own countrymen were at  first divided against her; a score of greedy, avaricious suitors sought  her destruction, or at least her hand to lead her to destruction; all  the great powers of the Continent were either demanding an alliance  with England or threatening to dash England down amid their own  dissensions.    What had this girl to play off against such dangers? Only an undaunted  spirit, a scheming mind that knew no scruples, and finally her own  person and the fact that she was a woman, and, therefore, might give  herself in marriage and become the mother of a race of kings.    It was this last weapon, the weapon of her sex, that proved, perhaps,  the most powerful of all. By promising a marriage or by denying it, or  by neither promising nor denying but withholding it, she gave forth a  thousand wily intimations which kept those who surrounded her at bay  until she had made still another deft and skilful combination, escaping  like some startled creature to a new place of safety.    In 1583, when she was fifty years of age, she had reached a point when  her courtships and her pretended love-making were no longer necessary.  She had played Sweden against Denmark, and France against Spain, and  the Austrian archduke against the others, and many suitors in her own  land against the different factions which they headed. She might have  sat herself down to rest; for she could feel that her wisdom had led  her up into a high place, whence she might look down in peace and with  assurance of the tranquillity that she had won. Not yet had the great  Armada rolled and thundered toward the English shores. But she was  certain that her land was secure, compact, and safe.    It remains to see what were those amatory relations which she may be  said to have sincerely held. She had played at love-making with foreign  princes, because it was wise and, for the moment, best. She had played  with Englishmen of rank who aspired to her hand, because in that way  she might conciliate, at one time her Catholic and at another her  Protestant subjects. But what of the real and inward feeling of her  heart, when she was not thinking of political problems or the  necessities of state!    This is an interesting question. One may at least seek the answer,  hoping thereby to solve one of the most interesting phases of this  perplexing and most remarkable woman.    It must be remembered that it was not a question of whether Elizabeth  desired marriage. She may have done so as involving a brilliant stroke  of policy. In this sense she may have wished to marry one of the two  French princes who were among her suitors. But even here she hesitated,  and her Parliament disapproved; for by this time England had become  largely Protestant. Again, had she married a French prince and had  children, England might have become an appanage of France.    There is no particular evidence that she had any feeling at all for her  Flemish, Austrian, or Russian suitors, while the Swede's pretensions  were the laughing-stock of the English court. So we may set aside this  question of marriage as having nothing to do with her emotional life.  She did desire a son, as was shown by her passionate outcry when she  compared herself with Mary of Scotland.    \"The Queen of Scots has a bonny son, while I am but a barren stock!\"    She was too wise to wed a subject; though, had she married at all, her  choice would doubtless have been an Englishman. In this respect, as in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#7)"],[1,"of her that were written by those who  had occasion to be near her. Not only do they record swift glimpses of  her person, but sometimes in a word or two they give an insight into  certain traits of mind which came out prominently in her later years.    It may, perhaps, be well to view her as a woman before we regard her  more fully as a queen. It has been said that Elizabeth inherited many  of the traits of her father--the boldness of spirit, the rapidity of  decision, and, at the same time, the fox-like craft which often showed  itself when it was least expected.    Henry had also, as is well known, a love of the other sex, which has  made his reign memorable. And yet it must be noted that while he loved  much, it was not loose love. Many a king of England, from Henry II. to  Charles II., has offended far more than Henry VIII. Where Henry loved,  he married; and it was the unfortunate result of these royal marriages  that has made him seem unduly fond of women. If, however, we examine  each one of the separate espousals we shall find that he did not enter  into it lightly, and that he broke it off unwillingly. His ardent  temperament, therefore, was checked by a certain rational or  conventional propriety, so that he was by no means a loose liver, as  many would make him out to be.
