Recover yourselves, O  poor in Christ, and studiously regard us books, without which ye can  never be properly shod in the preparation of the Gospel of Peace.    Paul the Apostle, preacher of the truth and excellent teacher of the  nations, for all his gear bade three things to be brought to him by  Timothy, his cloak, books and parchments, affording an example to  ecclesiastics that they should wear dress in moderation, and should  have books for aid in study, and parchments, which the Apostle  especially esteems, for writing: AND ESPECIALLY, he says, the  parchments. And truly that clerk is crippled and maimed to his  disablement in many ways, who is entirely ignorant of the art of  writing.  He beats the air with words and edifies only those who are  present, but does nothing for the absent and for posterity.  The man  bore a writer's ink-horn upon his loins, who set a mark Tau upon the  foreheads of the men that sigh and cry, Ezechiel ix.; teaching in a  figure that if any lack skill in writing, he shall not undertake the  task of preaching repentance.    Finally, in conclusion of the present chapter, books implore of you:  make your young men who though ignorant are apt of intellect apply  themselves to study, furnishing them with necessaries, that ye may  teach them not only goodness but discipline and science, may terrify  them by blows, charm them by blandishments, mollify them by gifts, and  urge them on by painful rigour, so that they may become at once  Socratics in morals and Peripatetics in learning.  Yesterday, as it  were at the eleventh hour, the prudent householder introduced you into  his vineyard.  Repent of idleness before it is too late: would that  with the cunning steward ye might be ashamed of begging so shamelessly;  for then no doubt ye would devote yourselves more assiduously to us  books and to study.        CHAPTER VII    THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST WARS    Almighty Author and Lover of peace, scatter the nations that delight in  war, which is above all plagues injurious to books.  For wars being  without the control of reason make a wild assault on everything they  come across, and, lacking the check of reason they push on without  discretion or distinction to destroy the vessels of reason.  Then the  wise Apollo becomes the Python's prey, and Phronesis, the pious mother,  becomes subject to the power of Phrenzy.  Then winged Pegasus is shut  up in the stall of Corydon, and eloquent Mercury is strangled.  Then  wise Pallas is struck down by the dagger of error, and the charming  Pierides are smitten by the truculent tyranny of madness.  O cruel  spectacle!  where you may see the Phoebus of philosophers, the all-wise  Aristotle, whom God Himself made master of the master of the world,  enchained by wicked hands and borne in shameful irons on the shoulders  of gladiators from his sacred home.  There you may see him who was  worthy to be lawgiver to the lawgiver of the world and to hold empire  over its emperor, made the slave of vile buffoons by the most  unrighteous laws of war.  O most wicked power of darkness, which does  not fear to undo the approved divinity of Plato, who alone was worthy  to submit to the view of the Creator, before he assuaged the strife of  warring chaos, and before form had put on its garb of matter, the ideal  types, in order to demonstrate the archetypal universe to its author,  so that the world of sense might be modelled after the supernal  pattern.  O tearful sight! where the moral Socrates, whose acts were  virtue and whose discourse was science, who deduced political justice  from the principles of nature, is seen enslaved to some rascal robber.  We bemoan Pythagoras, the parent of harmony, as, brutally scourged by  the harrying furies of war, he utters not a song but the wailings of a  dove.  We mourn, too, for Zeno, who lest he should betray his secret  bit off his tongue and fearlessly spat it out at the tyrant, and now,  alas! is brayed and crushed to death in a mortar by Diomedon.    In sooth we cannot mourn with the grief that they deserve all the  various books that have perished by the fate of war in various parts of  the world.  Yet we must tearfully recount the dreadful ruin which was  caused in Egypt by the auxiliaries in the Alexandrian war, when seven  hundred thousand volumes were consumed by fire.  These volumes had been  collected by the royal Ptolemies through long periods of time, as Aulus  Gellius relates.  What an Atlantean progeny must be supposed to have  then perished: including the motions of the spheres, all the  conjunctions of the planets, the nature of the galaxy, and the  prognostic generations of comets, and all that exists in the heavens or  in the ether!  Who would not shudder at such a hapless holocaust, where  ink is offered up instead of blood, where the glowing ashes of  crackling parchment were encarnadined with blood, where the devouring  flames consumed so many thousands of innocents in whose mouth was no  guile, where the unsparing fire turned into stinking ashes so many  shrines of eternal truth!  A lesser crime than this is the sacrifice of  Jephthah or Agamemnon, where a pious daughter is slain by a father's  sword.  How many labours of the famous Hercules shall we suppose then  perished, who because of his knowledge of astronomy is said to have  sustained the heaven on his unyielding neck, when Hercules was now for  the second time cast into the flames.  The secrets of the heavens,  which Jonithus learnt not from man or through man but received by  divine inspiration; what his brother Zoroaster, the servant of unclean  spirits, taught the Bactrians; what holy Enoch, the prefect of  Paradise, prophesied before he was taken from the world, and finally,  what the first Adam taught his children of the things to come, which he  had seen when caught up in an ecstasy in the book of eternity, are  believed to have perished in those horrid flames.  The religion of the  Egyptians, which the book of the Perfect Word so commends; the  excellent polity of the older Athens, which preceded by nine thousand  years the Athens of Greece; the charms of the Chaldaeans; the  observations of the Arabs and Indians; the ceremonies of the Jews; the  architecture of the Babylonians; the agriculture of Noah the magic arts  of Moses; the geometry of Joshua; the enigmas of Samson; the problems  of Solomon from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop; the antidotes of  Aesculapius; the grammar of Cadmus; the poems of Parnassus; the oracles  of Apollo; the argonautics of Jason; the stratagems of Palamedes, and  infinite other secrets of science are believed to have perished at the  time of this conflagration.    Nay, Aristotle would not have missed the quadrature of the circle, if  only baleful conflicts had spared the books of the ancients, who knew  all the methods of nature.  He would not have left the problem of the  eternity of the world an open question, nor, as is credibly conceived,  would he have had any doubts of the plurality of human intellects and  of their eternity, if the perfect sciences of the ancients had not been  exposed to the calamities of hateful wars.  For by wars we are  scattered into foreign lands, are mutilated, wounded, and shamefully  disfigured, are buried under the earth and overwhelmed in the sea, are  devoured by the flames and destroyed by every kind of death. How much  of our blood was shed by warlike Scipio, when he was eagerly compassing  the overthrow of Carthage, the opponent and rival of the Roman empire!  How many thousands of thousands of us did the ten years' war of Troy  dismiss from the light of day! How many were driven by Anthony, after  the murder of Tully, to seek hiding places in foreign provinces! How  many of us were scattered by Theodoric, while Boethius was in exile,  into the different quarters of the world, like sheep whose shepherd has  been struck down!  How many, when Seneca fell a victim to the cruelty  of Nero, and willing yet unwilling passed the gates of death, took  leave of him and retired in tears, not even knowing in what quarter to  seek for shelter!    Happy was that translation of books which Xerxes is said to have made  to Persia from Athens, and which Seleucus brought back again from  Persia to Athens.  O glad and joyful return!  O wondrous joy, which you  might then see in Athens, when the mother went in triumph to meet her  progeny, and again showed the chambers in which they had been nursed to  her now aging children! Their old homes were restored to their former  inmates, and forthwith boards of cedar with shelves and beams of gopher  wood are most skilfully planed; inscriptions of gold and ivory are  designed for the several compartments, to which the volumes themselves  are reverently brought and pleasantly arranged, so that no one hinders  the entrance of another or injures its brother by excessive crowding.    But in truth infinite are the losses which have been inflicted upon the  race of books by wars and tumults.  And as it is by no means possible  to enumerate and survey infinity, we will here finally set up the Gades  of our complaint, and turn again to the prayers with which we began,  humbly imploring that the Ruler of Olympus and the Most High Governor  of all the world will establish peace and dispel wars and make our days  tranquil under His protection.        CHAPTER VIII    OF THE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE HAD OF COLLECTING A STORE OF BOOKS    Since to everything there is a season and an opportunity, as the wise  Ecclesiastes witnesseth, let us now proceed to relate the manifold  opportunities through which we have been assisted by the divine  goodness in the acquisition of books.    Although from our youth upwards we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#7)"],[1," and Soada had been  hunting jackals in the desert all afternoon. Hardly had the barber fled  from the anger of Wassef, when a glittering kavass of the Mouffetish at  Cairo passed by on a black errand of conscription. With a curse Wassef  felt in his vest for his purse, and called to the kavass--the being more  dreaded in Egypt than the plague.    That very night the conscription descended upon Mahommed Selim, and by  sunrise he was standing in front of the house of the Mamour with twelve  others, to begin the march to Dongola. Though the young man's father  went secretly to the Mamour, and offered him backsheesh, even to the  tune of a feddan of land, the Mamour refused to accept it. That was a  very peculiar thing, because every Egyptian official, from the Khedive  down to the ghafhr of the cane-fields, took backsheesh in the name of  Allah.    Wassef the camel-driver was the cause. He was a deep man and a strong;  and it was through him the conscription descended upon Mahommed  Selim--\"son of a burnt father,\" as he called him--who had gone shooting  jackals in the desert with his daughter, and had lost him his breakfast.  Wassef's rage was quiet but effective, for he had whispered to some  purpose in the ear of the Mamour as well as in that of the dreaded  kavass of conscription. Afterwards, he had gone home and smiled at Soada  his daughter when she lied to him about the sunset breakfast.    With a placid smile and lips that murmured, \"Praise be to God,\" the  malignant camel-driver watched the shrieking women of the village  throwing dust on their heads and lamenting loudly for the thirteen young  men of Beni Souef who were going forth never to return--or so it seemed  to them; for of all the herd of human kine driven into the desert  before whips and swords, but a moiety ever returned, and that moiety so  battered that their mothers did not know them. Therefore, at Beni Souef  that morning women wept, and men looked sullenly upon the ground--all  but Wassef the camel-driver.    It troubled the mind of Wassef that Mahommed Selim made no outcry at his  fate. He was still more puzzled when the Mamour whispered to him that  Mahommed Selim had told the kavass and his own father that since it was  the will of God, then the will of God was his will, and he would go.  Wassef replied that the Mamour did well not to accept the backsheesh  of Mahommed Selim's father, for the Mouffetish at the palace of Ismail  would have heard of it, and there would have been an end to the Mamour.  It was quite a different matter when it was backsheesh for sending  Mahommed Selim to the Soudan.    With a shameless delight Wassef went to the door of his own home, and,  calling to Soada, told her that Mahommed Selim was among the conscripts.  He also told her that the young man was willing to go, and that the  Mamour would take no backsheesh from his father. He looked to see her  burst into tears and wailing, but she only stood and looked at him like  one stricken blind. Wassef laughed, and turned on his heel; and went  out: for what should he know of the look in a woman's face--he to whom  most women were alike, he who had taken dancing-girls with his camels  into the desert many a time? What should he know of that love which  springs once in every woman's heart, be she fellah or Pharaoh's  daughter?    When he had gone, Soada groped her way blindly to the door and out into  the roadway. Her lips moved, but she only said: \"Mahommed--Mahommed  Selim!\" Her father's words knelled in her ear that her lover was willing  to go, and she kept saying brokenly: \"Mahommed--Mahommed Selim!\" As the  mist left her eyes she saw the conscripts go by, and Mahommed Selim was  in the rear rank. He saw her also, but he kept his head turned away,  taking a cigarette from young Yusef, the drunken ghaffir, as they passed  on.    Unlike the manner of her people, Soada turned and went back into her  house, and threw herself upon the mud floor, and put the folds of her  garment in her mouth lest she should cry out in her agony. A whole day  she lay there and did not stir, save to drink from the water-bottle  which old Fatima, the maker of mats, had placed by her side. For Fatima  thought of the far-off time when she loved Hassan the potter, who had  been dragged from his wheel by a kavass of conscription and lost among  the sands of the Libyan desert; and she read the girl's story.    That evening, as Wassef the camel-driver went to the mosque to pray,  Fatima cursed him, because now all the village laughed secretly at the  revenge that Wassef had taken upon the lover of his daughter. A few  laughed the harder because they knew Wassef would come to feel it had  been better to have chained Mahommed Selim to a barren fig-tree and  kept him there until he married Soada, than to let him go. He had  mischievously sent him into that furnace which eats the Fellaheen to  the bones, and these bones thereafter mark white the road of the Red Sea  caravans and the track of the Khedive's soldiers in the yellow sands.    When Fatima cursed Wassef he turned and spat at her; and she went back  and sat on the ground beside Soada, and mumbled tags from the Koran  above her for comfort. Then she ate greedily the food which Soada should  have eaten; snatching scraps of consolation in return for the sympathy  she gave.    The long night went, the next day came, and Soada got up and began to  work again. And the months went by.      II    One evening, on a day which had been almost too hot for even the  seller of liquorice-water to go by calling and clanging, Wassef the  camel-driver sat at the door of a malodorous cafe and listened to a  wandering welee chanting the Koran. Wassef was in an ill-humour: first,  because the day had been so hot; secondly, because he had sold his  ten-months' camel at a price almost within the bounds of honesty; and  thirdly, because a score of railway contractors and subs. were camped  outside the town. Also, Soada had scarcely spoken to him for three days  past.    In spite of all, Soada had been the apple of his eye, although he had  sworn again and again that next to a firman of the Sultan, a ten-months'  camel was the most beautiful thing on earth. He was in a bitter humour.  This had been an intermittent disease with him almost since the day  Mahommed Selim had been swallowed up by the Soudan; for, like her mother  before her, Soada had no mind to be a mat for his feet. Was it not even  said that Soada's mother was descended from an English slave with red  hair, who in the terrible disaster at Damietta in 1805 had been carried  away into captivity on the Nile, where he married a fellah woman and  died a good Mussulman?    Soada's mother had had red-brown hair, and not black as becomes a fellah  woman; but Wassef was proud of this ancient heritage of red hair, which  belonged to a field-marshal of Great Britain--so he swore by the beard  of the Prophet. That is why he had not beaten Soada these months past  when she refused to answer him, when with cold stubbornness she gave him  his meals or withheld them at her will. He was even a little awed by her  silent force of will, and at last he had to ask her humbly for a savoury  dish which her mother had taught her to make--a dish he always ate upon  the birthday of Mahomet Ali, who had done him the honour to flog him  with his own kourbash for filching the rations of his Arab charger.    But this particular night Wassef was bitter, and watched with stolid  indifference the going down of the sun, the time when he usually said  his prayers. He was in so ill a humour that he would willingly have  met his old enemy, Yusef, the drunken ghaffir, and settled their  long-standing dispute for ever. But Yusef came not that way. He was  lying drunk with hashish outside the mosque El Hassan, with a letter  from Mahommed Selim in his green turban--for Yusef had been a pilgrimage  to Mecca and might wear the green turban.    But if Yusef came not by the cafe where Wassef sat glooming, some one  else came who quickly roused Wassef from his phlegm. It was Donovan  Pasha, the young English official, who had sat with him many a time at  the door of his but and asked him questions about Dongola and Berber and  the Soudanese. And because Dicky spoke Arabic, and was never known to  have aught to do with the women of Beni Souef, he had been welcome; and  none the less because he never frowned when an Arab told a lie.    \"Nehar-ak koom said, Mahommed Wassef,\" said Dicky; and sat upon a  bench and drew a narghileh to him, wiping the ivory mouthpiece with his  handkerchief.    \"Nehar-ak said, saadat el Pasha,\" answered Wassef, and touched lips,  breast, and forehead with his hand. Then they shook hands, thumbs up,  after the ancient custom. And once more, Wassef touched his breast, his  lips, and his forehead.    They sat silent too long for Wassef's pleasure, for he took pride in  what he was pleased to call his friendship with Donovan Pasha, and he  could see his watchful neighbours gathering at a little distance. It did  not suit his book that they two should not talk together.    \"May Allah take them to his mercy!--A regiment was cut to pieces by the  Dervishes at Dongola last quarter of the moon,\" he said.    \"It was not the regiment of Mahommed Selim,\" Dicky answered slowly, with  a curious hard note in his voice.    \"All blessings do not come at once--such is the will of God!\" answered  Wassef with a sneer.    \"You brother of asses,\" said Dicky, showing his teeth a little, \"you  brother of asses of Bagdad!\"    \"Saadat el basha!\" exclaimed Wassef, angry and dumfounded.    \"You had better have gone yourself, and left Mahommed Selim your camels  and your daughter,\" continued Dicky, his eyes straight upon Wassef's.    \"God knows your meaning,\" said Wassef in a sudden fright; for the  Englishman's tongue was straight, as he well knew.    \"They sneer at you behind your back, Mahommed Wassef. No man in the  village dare"]]]
