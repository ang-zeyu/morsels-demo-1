Yet the juror was undoubtedly right  in his deduction.    In a case where insanity is the defence, the State must dig up and have  at hand every person it can find who knew the accused at any period of  his career. He will probably claim that in his youth he was kicked in  a game of foot-ball and fractured his skull, that later he fell into an  elevator shaft and had concussion of the brain, or that he was hit on  the head by a burglar. It is usually difficult, if not impossible, to  disprove such assertions, but the prosecutor must be ready, if he can,  to show that foot-ball was not invented until after the defendant had  attained maturity, that it was some other man who fell down the elevator  shaft, and to produce the burglar to deny that the assault occurred.  Naturally, complete preparation for an important trial demands the  presence of many witnesses who ultimately are not needed and who are  never called. Probably in most such cases about half the witnesses  do not testify at all. Most of what has been said relates to the  preparation for trial of cases where the accused is already under arrest  when the district attorney is called into the case. If this stage has  not been reached the prosecutor may well be called upon to exercise some  of the functions of a detective in the first instance.    A few years ago it was brought to the attention of the New York  authorities that many blackmailing letters were being received bearing  the name of \"Lewis Jarvis.\" These were of a character to render the  apprehension of the writer of them a matter of much importance. The  letters directed that the replies be sent to a certain box in the New  York post-office, but as the boxes are numerous and close together it  seemed doubtful if \"Lewis Jarvis\" could be detected when he called  for his mail. The district attorney, the police, and the post-office  officials finally evolved the scheme of plugging the lock of \"Lewis  Jarvis's\" box with a match. The scheme worked, for \"Jarvis,\" finding  that he could not use his key, went to the delivery window and asked for  his mail. The very instant the letters reached his hand the gyves were  upon the wrists of one of the best-known attorneys in the city.    When the district attorney has been apprised that a crime has been  committed, and that a certain person is the guilty party, he not  infrequently allows the suspect to go his way under the careful watch  of detectives, and thus often secures much new evidence against him. In  this way it is sometimes established that the accused has endeavored  to bribe the witnesses and to induce them to leave the State, while  the whereabouts of stolen loot is often discovered. In most instances,  however, the district attorney begins where the police leave off, and  he merely supplements their labors and prepares for the actual trial  itself. But the press he has always with him, and from the first moment  after the crime up to the execution of the sentence or the liberation of  the accused, the reporters dog his footsteps, sit on his doorstep, and  deluge him with advice and information.    Now a curious feature about the evidence \"worked up\" by reporters for  their papers is that little of it materializes when the prosecutor  wishes to make use of it. Of course, some reporters do excellent  detective work, and there are one or two veterans attached to the  criminal courts in New York City who, in addition to their literary  capacities, are natural-born sleuths, and combine with a knowledge of  criminal law, almost as extensive as that of a regular prosecutor, a  resourcefulness and nerve that often win the case for whichever side  they espouse. I have frequently found that these men knew more about the  cases which I was prosecuting than I did myself, and a tip from them has  more than once turned defeat into victory. But newspaper men, for one  reason or another, are loath to testify, and usually make but poor  witnesses. They feel that their motives will be questioned, and are  naturally unwilling to put themselves in an equivocal position.  The writer well remembers that in the Mabel Parker case, where the  defendant, a young and pretty woman, had boasted of her forgeries before  a roomful of reporters, it was impossible, when her trial was called, to  find more than one of them who would testify--and he had practically to  be dragged to the witness chair. In point of fact, if reporters made a  practice of being witnesses it would probably hurt their business. But,  however much \"faked\" news may be published, a prosecutor who did not  listen to all the hints the press boys had to give would make a great  mistake; and as allies and advisers they are often invaluable, for they  can tell him where and how to get evidence of which otherwise he would  never hear.    The week before a great case is called is a busy one for the prosecutor  in charge. He is at his office early to interview his main witnesses and  go over their testimony with them so that their regular daily work  may not be interrupted more than shall be actually necessary. Some he  cautions against being overenthusiastic and others he encourages to  greater emphasis. The bashful \"cop\" is badgered until at last he ceases  to begin his testimony in the cut-and-dried police fashion.    \"On the morning of the twenty-second of July, about 3.30 A.M., while on  post at the corner of Desbrosses Street--,\" he starts.    \"Oh, quit that!\" shouts the district attorney. \"Tell me what you saw in  your own words.\"    The \"cop\" blushes and stammers:    \"Aw, well, on the morning of the twenty-second of July, about 3.30 A.M.\"    \"Look here!\" yells the prosecutor, jumping to his feet and shaking his  fist at him, \"do you want to be taken for a d--n liar? 'Morning of  the twenty-second of July, about 3.30 A.M., while on post I' You never  talked like that in your life.\"    By this time the \"cop\" is \"mad clear through.\"    \"I'm no liar!\" he retorts. \"I saw the ------ pull his gun and shoot!\"    \"Well, why didn't you say so?\" laughs the prosecutor, and the officer  mollified with a cigar, dimly perceives the objectionable feature of his  testimony.    About this time one of the sleuths comes in to report that certain  much-desired witnesses have been \"located\" and are in custody  downstairs. The assistant makes immediate preparation for taking their  statements. Then one of the experts comes in for a chat about a new  phase of the case occasioned by the discovery that the defendant  actually did have spasms when an infant. The assistant wisely makes an  appointment for the evening. A telegram arrives saying that a witness  for the defence has just started for New York from Philadelphia and  should be duly watched on arrival. The district attorney sends for the  assistant to inquire if he has looked up the law on similar cases in  Texas and Alabama--which he probably has not done; and a friend on the  telephone informs him that Tomkins, who has been drawn on the jury, is  a boon companion of the prisoner and was accustomed to play bridge with  him every Sunday night before the murder.    Coincidently, some private detectives enter with a long report on the  various members of the panel, including the aforesaid Tomkins, whom they  pronounce to be \"all right,\" and as never having, to their knowledge,  laid eyes on the accused. Finally, in despair, the prosecutor locks  himself in his library with a copy of the Bible, \"Bartlett's Familiar  Quotations,\" and a volume of celebrated speeches, to prepare his summing  up, for no careful trial lawyer opens a case without first having  prepared, to some extent, at least, his closing address to the jury. He  has thought about this for weeks and perhaps for months. In his dreams  he has formulated syllogisms and delivered them to imaginary yet  obstinate talesman. He has glanced through many volumes for similes and  quotations of pertinency. He has tried various arguments on his friends  until he knows just how, if he succeeds in proving certain facts and  the defence expected is interposed, he is going to convince the twelve  jurors that the defendant is guilty and, perhaps, win an everlasting  reputation as an orator himself.    This superficial sketch of how an important criminal case is got  ready for trial would be incomplete without some further reference to  something which has been briefly hinted at before--preparation upon its  purely legal aspect. This may well demand almost as much labor as  that required in amassing the evidence. Yet a careful and painstaking  investigation of the law governing every aspect of the case is  indispensable to success. The prosecutor with a perfectly clear case may  see the defendant walk out of court a free man, simply because he has  neglected to acquaint himself with the various points of law which may  arise in the course of the trial, and the lawyer for an accused may  find his client convicted upon a charge to which he has a perfectly good  legal defence, for the same reason.    Looking at it from the point of view of the prisoner's counsel, it is  obvious that it is quite as efficacious to free your client on a point  of law, without having the case go to the jury at all, as to secure an  acquittal at their hands.    At the conclusion of the evidence introduced in behalf of the State  there is always a motion made to dismiss the case on the ground of  alleged insufficiency in the proof. This has usually been made the  subject of the most exhaustive study by the lawyers for the defence,  and requires equal preparation on the part of the prosecutor. The writer  recalls trying a bankrupt, charged with fraud, where the lawyer for  the defendant had written a brief of some three hundred pages upon the  points of law which he proposed to argue to the court upon his motion to  acquit.

Bancroft's \"History of Utah,\"  202]    RIGDON'S PRIOR RELIGIOUS DISHONESTY.    There are two circumstances of the above narrative which need a little  further elucidation, since the impressions which Rigdon made upon his  discerning intimates during his earlier life may have some bearing upon  the force to be given to the circumstantial evidence concerning his  after life.    As to Rigdon's conversion to the Baptist Church so very soon after the  time when Spaulding expressed the suspicion that Rigdon had stolen his  manuscript, the Rev. Samuel Williams, in his \"Mormonism Exposed,\" says:  \"He [Rigdon] professed to experience a change of heart when a young  man, and proposed to join the church under the care of Elder David  Phillips. But there was so much miracle about his conversion, and so  much parade about his profession, that the pious and discerning pastor  entertained serious doubts at the time in regard to the genuineness  of the work. He was received, however, by the church and baptized  by the pastor with some fears and doubts upon his mind. Very soon,  Diotrephes-like, he began to put himself forward and seek pre-eminence,  and was well-nigh supplanting the tried and faithful minister who  had reared and nursed and led the church for a long series of years.  So thoroughly convinced was Father Phillips by this time that he was  not possessed of the spirit of Christ, notwithstanding his miraculous  conversion and flippant speech, that he declared his belief 'that as  long as he [Sidney Rigdon] should live, he would be a curse to the  church of Christ.'\" [68]    [Footnote 68: \"Mormonism Exposed,\" by Williams, copied in \"Who Wrote  the Book of Mormon?\" page 13.]    Concerning Rigdon's expulsion or resignation from the Baptist Church,  the Mormons declare that it was caused by Rigdon's refusal to either  accept or teach the doctrine of infant damnation. Dr. Winter, in the  course of a historical notice of the First Baptist Church of Pittsburg,  says: \"When Holland Sumner dealt with Rigdon for his bad teachings,  and said to him: 'Brother Rigdon, you never got into a Baptist church  without relating your Christian experiences,' Rigdon replied: 'When  I joined the church at Peter's Creek I knew I could not be admitted  without an experience, so I made up one to suit the purpose; but it was  all made up and was of no use, nor true.' This I have just copied from  an old memorandum as taken from Sumner himself.\" [69]    [Footnote 69: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 13. _Baptist Witness_  (Pittsburg), January 1, 1875.]    The first of these accounts was published in 1842, the last in January,  1875, and Rigdon lived until July 14, 1876. While one H. A. Dunlavy of  Lebanon, O., did, in the March number of the same paper, publish an  apology for Rigdon by way of answer to the article of Dr. Winter, yet  neither Dunlavy nor Rigdon ever denied the facts alleged therein. We  must, therefore, accept the facts stated as true, and they fasten upon  Rigdon such religious dishonesty as establishes his willingness to be  a party to a religious fraud in kind like the one here charged against  him.    This, then, brings us to the question of what, if any, opportunity  Rigdon had for stealing Spaulding's manuscript from Patterson's  publishing office.    RIGDON HAD OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THE MANUSCRIPT.    It has been frequently charged that Sidney Rigdon lived in Pittsburg  and was connected with the Patterson printing office during 1815 and  1816. To this charge Rigdon, under date Commerce (Ill.), May 27, 1839,  makes the following denial:        \"It is only necessary to say in relation to the whole story about      Spaulding's writings being in the hands of Mr. Patterson, who was      then in Pittsburg, and who is said to have kept a private printing      office, and my saying that I was connected with the same office,      etc., etc., is the most base of lies, without even the shadow      of truth. There was no man by the name of Patterson during my      residence in Pittsburg who had a printing office; what might have      been before I lived here, I know not. Mr. Robert Patterson, I was      told, had owned a printing office before I lived in that city, but      had been unfortunate in business and failed before my residence in      Pittsburg. This Mr. Patterson, who was a Presbyterian preacher,      I had a very slight acquaintance with during my residence there.      He was then acting under an agency in the book and stationery      business, and was the owner of no property of any kind, printing      office, or anything else during the time I resided in that city. If      I were to say that I ever heard of the Rev. Solomon Spaulding and      his hopeful wife until Dr. P. Hurlburt wrote his lie about me, I      should be a liar like unto themselves.\" [70]    [Footnote 70: \"Spaulding Story Examined and Exposed,\" 11 and 12.  \"History of the Mormons,\" 45 and 46. \"The Mormons,\" 34. \"Braden-Kelly  Debate,\" 94. \"Plain Facts Showing the Falsehood and Folly of the Rev.  C.S. Bush,\" p. 14 to 16.]    The evidence upon which is based the charge of Rigdon having a  permanent residence in Pittsburg during the years in question, or his  connection with Patterson's printing office, is so unsatisfactory  that these issues must be found in favor of Rigdon's denial, even in  spite of the fact that his evidence is discredited by reason of the  conclusion as to his guilt, which is to be hereafter set forth, and his  personal interest.    Rigdon, it will be remembered, lived within from six to ten miles of  Pittsburg during the years in question. Pittsburg was the only town of  consequence, and the family's place of buying and selling. Rigdon would  of necessity make many friends in the city, and it would not be strange  if almost everybody knew him and he knew all of the prominent citizens.  In 1810 Pittsburg had only about 4,000 inhabitants, and in 1820 had but  7,248.    The very prevalent notion as to Rigdon's connection with the Patterson  publishing establishment must have had some origin, which, in all  probability, would be Rigdon's close friendship for some who were, in  fact, connected with it. Upon this theory only can we account for such  a general impression. [71]    [Footnote 71: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 11.]    It might be well, before entering upon that subject, to fix in our  minds Patterson's business mutations. In 1812 Patterson was in the book  business in the firm of Patterson and Hopkins. They had then in their  employ one J. Harrison Lambdin, he being a lad of fourteen. January 1,  1818, Lambdin was taken into the partnership of Patterson and Lambdin,  which firm succeeded R. and J. Patterson. R. Patterson had in his  employ one Silas Engles as foreman printer and superintendent of the  printing business. As such, the latter decided upon the propriety, or  otherwise, of publishing manuscripts when offered. The partnership of  Patterson and Lambdin \"had under its control the book store on Fourth  Street, a book bindery, a printing office (not newspaper, but job  office, under the name of Buttler and Lambdin), entrance on Diamond  Alley, and a steam paper mill on the Allegheny (under the name of R.  and J. Patterson).\" [72] Patterson and Lambdin continued in business  until 1823. Lambdin died August 1, 1825, in his twenty-seventh year.  Silas Engles died July 17, 1827, in his forty-sixth year. R. Patterson  died September 5, 1854, in his eighty-second year. [73]    [Footnote 72: \"Myth of the Manuscript Found,\" 26. \"Who Wrote the Book  of Mormon?\" 9.]    [Footnote 73: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 7 and 9. This covers all  Patterson's migrations.]    RIGDON'S ONLY DENIAL ANALYZED.    Let us now analyze Mr. Rigdon's denial of 1839 as quoted above. Rigdon  was an educated man, a controversialist in religion, and at the date of  the denial he was also a lawyer. Therefore we are justified in holding  him in a strict accountability for all that is necessarily implied from  what he says or omits to say, as we could not, in justice, do with a  layman.    Rigdon's first denial is of the \"Story about Spaulding's writing being  in the hands of Patterson.\" This story is established by the evidence  already adduced and some besides, even to the satisfaction of most  Mormons.    The negative of this proposition Mr. Rigdon, if he was a stranger to  the office, as is claimed, could not possibly assert as a matter within  his own knowledge. If Rigdon had in his mind any fact upon which he  justified this assertion, it could only have been a knowledge that  the manuscript was at the printing office of Buttler and Lambdin, not  knowing that that office was controlled by Patterson.    The second denial in Rigdon's statement is: \"There was no man by the  name of Patterson during my residence in Pittsburg who had a printing  office.\" The foregoing account of Patterson's business affairs is  made up from the information possessed by Patterson's family and an  employee. It must, therefore, be accepted as correct. Here again  Rigdon's denial can be accounted for by assuming his ignorance of  Patterson's interest in the printing office known as Buttler and  Lambdin. Rigdon's son says Rigdon lived in Pittsburg in 1818. Church  biographers allege that he preached there regularly after January 28,  1822. During 1818 and 1822 Patterson was in the printing business, and  Rigdon's statement must be deemed untrue.    Howe, in his \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" [74] did, as early as 1834, charge  that Rigdon had"]]]
