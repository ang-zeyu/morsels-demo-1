For why, reason  saith that, in comparison of this sweetness, all other sweetness is  sorrow, and bitter as gall before honey. Nevertheless, yet may a man  never come to such a grace by his own slight.[111] For why, it is  the gift of God without desert of man. But without doubt, though it  be not the desert of man, yet no man may take such grace without  great study and brenning desires coming before; and that woteth  Rachel full well, and therefore she multiplieth her study, and  whetteth her desires, seeking desire upon desire;[112] so that at  the last, in great abundance of brenning desires and sorrow of the  delaying of her desire, Benjamin is born, and his mother Rachel  dieth;[113] for why, in what time that a soul is ravished above  itself by abundance of desires and a great multitude of love, so  that it is inflamed with the light of the Godhead, sikerly then  dieth all man's reason.    And therefore, what so thou be that covetest to come to  contemplation of God, that is to say, to bring forth such a child  that men clepen in the story Benjamin (that is to say, sight of  God), then shalt thou use thee in this manner. Thou shalt call  together thy thoughts and thy desires, and make thee of them a  church, and learn thee therein for to love only this good word Jesu,  so that all thy desires and all thy thoughts are only set for to  love Jesu, and that unceasingly as it may be here; so that thou  fulfill that is said in the psalm: \"Lord, I shall bless Thee in  churches\";[114] that is, in thoughts and desires of the love of  Jesu. And then, in this church of thoughts and desires, and in this  onehead of studies and of wills, look that all thy thoughts, and all  thy desires, and all thy studies, and all thy wills be only set in  the love and the praising of this Lord Jesu, without forgetting, as  far forth as thou mayst by grace, and as thy frailty will suffer;  evermore meeking thee to prayer and to counsel, patiently abiding  the will of our Lord, unto the time that thy mind be ravished above  itself, to be fed with the fair food of angels in the beholding of  God and ghostly things:[115] so that it be fulfilled in thee that is  written in the psalm: Ibi Benjamin adolesentulus in mentis  excessu;[116] that is: \"There is Benjamin, the young child, in  ravishing of mind.\" The grace of Jesu keep thee evermore.[117] Amen    DEO GRATIAS          II.    HERE FOLLOWETH DIVERS DOCTRINES DEVOUT AND FRUITFUL, TAKEN OUT OF  THE LIFE OF THAT GLORIOUS VIRGIN AND SPOUSE OF OUR LORD, SAINT  KATHERIN OF SEENES. AND FIRST THOSE WHICH OUR LORD TAUGHT AND SHEWED  TO HERSELF, AND SITH THOSE WHICH SHE TAUGHT AND SHEWED UNTO OTHERS      THE first doctrine of our Lord is this:    \"Knowest thou not, daughter, who thou art and who I am? If thou know  well these two words, thou art and shalt be blessed. Thou art she  that art nought; and I am He that am ought.[118] If thou have the  very knowledge of these two things in thy soul, thy ghostly enemy  shall never deceive thee, but thou shalt eschew graciously all his  malice;[119] and thou shalt never consent to any thing that is  against My commandments and precepts, but all grace, all truth, and  all charity thou shalt win without any hardness.\"    The second doctrine of our Lord is this:    \"Think on Me, and I shall think on thee.\"    In declaring of which doctrine she was wont to say that:    \"A soul which is verily united to God perceiveth not, seeth not, nor  loveth not herself, nor none other soul, nor hath no mind of no  creature but only on God.\"    And these words she expoundeth more expressly, and saith thus:    \"Such a soul seeth herself, that she is very nought of herself, and  knoweth perfectly that all the goodness, with all the mights of the  soul, is her Maker's. She forsaketh utterly herself and all  creatures, and hideth herself fully in her Maker, our Lord Jesu; in  so much that she sendeth fully and principally all her ghostly and  bodily workings in to Him; in whom she perceiveth that she may find  all goodness, and all perfection of blessedness. And, therefore, she  shall have no will to go out from such inward knowledge of Him for  nothing.[120] And of this unity of love, that is increased every day  in such a soul, she is transformed in a manner in to our Lord, that  she may neither think, nor understand, nor love, nor have no mind  but God, or else in God. For she may not see herself, nor none other  creature, but only in God; nor she may not love herself, nor none  other, but only in God; nor she may have no mind of herself nor of  none other, but only in God, nor she may have no mind but only of  her Maker. And therefore,\" she said, \"we shall have none other  business but only to think how we may please Him, unto whom we have  committed all our governance both in body and soul.\"    The third doctrine of our Lord is this; in obtaining of virtue and  ghostly strength:    \"Daughter, if thou wilt get unto thee virtue and also ghostly  strength,[121] thou must follow Me. Albeit that I might by My godly  virtue have overcome all the power of the fiends by many manner ways  of overcoming, yet, for to give you ensample by My manhood, I would  not overcome him but only by taking of death upon the Cross, that ye  might be taught thereby, if ye will overcome your ghostly enemies,  for to take the Cross as I did; the which Cross shall be to you a  great refreshing in all your temptations, if ye have mind of the  pains that I suffered thereon.[122] And certainly the pains of the  Cross may well be called refreshing of temptations, for the more  pain ye suffer for My love, the more like ye be to Me. And if ye be  so like to Me in passion, needs ye must be like to Me in joy.[123]  Therefore for My love, daughter, suffer patiently bitter things, and  not sweet things; and doubt in no wise, for thou shalt be strong  enough for to suffer all things patiently.\"    The first doctrine of this glorious virgin is this:    \"A soul which is verily mete[124] to God, as much as it hath of the  love of God, so much it hath of the hate of her own sensuality. For  of the love of God naturally cometh hate of sin, the which is done  against God. The soul, therefore, considering that the root and  beginning of sin reigneth in the sensuality, and there principally  is rooted, she is moved and stirred highly and holily with all her  mights against her own sensuality; not utterly to destroy the root,  for that may not be, as long as the soul dwelleth in the body living  in this life, but ever there shall be left a root, namely of small  venial sins. And because she may not utterly destroy the root of sin  thus in her sensuality, she conceiveth a great displeasaunce against  her sensuality, of the which displeasaunce springeth an holy hate  and a despising of the sensuality, by the which the soul is ever  well kept from her ghostly enemies. There is nothing that keepeth  the soul so strong and so sure as doth such an holy hate. And that  felt well the Apostle, when he said: Cum infirmor, tonc fortior sum  et potens;[125] that is: When I am sick and feeble in my sensuality  by hate of sin, then am I stronger and mightier in my soul. Lo, of  such hate cometh virtue, of such feebleness cometh strength, and of  such displeasaunce cometh pleasaunce. This holy hate maketh a man  meek, and to feel meek things of himself. It maketh him patient in  adversity, temperate in prosperity, and setteth him in all honesty  of virtue, and maketh him to be loved both of God and man. And where  this holy hate is not, there is inordinate love, which is the  stinking canal of all sin, and root[126] of all evil concupiscence.  Do therefore,\" she saith, \"your business to put away such inordinate  love of your own self, out of your hearts, and plant therein holy  hate of sin. For certain that is the right way to perfection, and  amendment of all sin.\"    Here is a common answer which she used to say to the fiends:    \"I trust in my Lord Jesu Christ, and not in myself.\"    Here is a rule how we shall behave us in time of temptation:    \"When temptation,\" she saith, \"ariseth in us, we should never  dispute nor make questions; for that is,\" she saith, \"that the fiend  most seeketh of us for to fall in questions with him. He trusteth so  highly in the great subtlety of his malice, that he should overcome  us with his sophistical reasons. Therefore a soul should never make  questions, nor answer to the questions of the fiend, but rather turn  her to devout prayer, and commend her to our Lord that she consent  not to his subtle demands; for by virtue of devout prayer, and  steadfast faith, we may overcome all the subtle temptations of the  fiend.\"    Here is a good conceit of this holy maid to eschew the temptations  of the fiend:    \"It happeneth,\" she said, \"that otherwhile[127] the devout fervour  of a soul loving our Lord Jesu, either by some certain sin, or else  by some new subtle temptations of the fiend, waxeth dull and slow,  and otherwhile it is brought to very coldness;[128] in so much that  some unwitty folks, considering that they be destitute from the  ghostly comfort the which they were wont to have, leave[129]  therefore the ghostly exercise that they were wont to use of prayer,  of meditations, of reading, of holy communications, and of penance  doing; whereby they be made more ready to be overcome of the fiend.  For he desireth nothing else of Christ's knights, but that they  should put away their armour by the which they were wont to overcome  their enemies. A wise knight of our Lord Jesu should not do so. But  thus, the more he feeleth[130] himself dull and slow, or cold in  devotion, the rather he should continue in his ghostly exercise, and  not for to make them less, but rather increase them.\"    Here is another doctrine of this holy maid, the which she used to  say to herself in edifying of others:    \"Thou vile and wretched creature, art thou worthy any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45456"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 1 of 2 (#7)"],[1,"on brass, became the  foundation of the Roman public law. Yet they persisted in making illegal  the union contracted between persons of the two orders, and left the  debtor at the mercy of the creditor, contrary to the decision of Servius  Tullius.    The decemvirs abused their power, and, on their fall, the claims of the  plebeians increased; the tribuneship, abolished during three years, was  re-established; it was decided that an appeal to the people from the  decision of any magistrate should be permitted, and that the laws made  in the assemblies by tribes, as well as in the assemblies by centuries,  should be obligatory on all.[111] There were thus, then, three sorts of  comitia; the comitia by curiae, which, conferring the _imperium_ on the  magistrates elected by the centuries, sanctioned in some sort the  election of the consuls;[112] the comitia by centuries, over which the  consuls presided; and the comitia by tribes, over which the tribunes  presided; the first named the consuls, the second the plebeian  magistrates, and both, composed of nearly the same citizens, had equally  the power of approving or rejecting the laws; but in the former, the  richest men and the nobility had all the influence, because they formed  the majority of the centuries and voted first; while in the latter, on  the contrary, the voters were confounded with that of the tribe to which  they belonged. \"If,\" says an ancient author, \"the suffrages are taken by  _gentes_ (_ex generibus hominum_), the comitia are by _curiae_; if  according to age and census, they are by _centuries_; finally, if the  vote be given according to territorial circumscription (_regionibus_),  they are by _tribes_.\"[113] In spite of these concessions, antagonism in  matters of law reigned always between the powers, the assemblies, and  the different classes of society.    The plebeians laid claim to all the offices of state, and especially to  the consulship, refusing to enrol themselves until their demands had  been satisfied; and they went so far in their claims that they insisted  upon the plebeian origin of the kings. \"Shall we, then,\" cried the  tribune Canuleius, addressing himself to the people, \"have consuls who  resemble the decemvirs, the vilest of mortals, all patricians, rather  than the best of our kings, all new men!\" that is, men without  ancestors.[114]    The Senate resisted, because it had no intention of conferring upon  plebeians the right which formed an attribute of the consuls, for the  convocation of the comitia, of taking the great auspices, a privilege  altogether of a religious character, the exclusive apanage of the  nobility.[115]    In order to obviate this difficulty, the Senate, after suppressing the  legal obstacles in the way of marriages between the two orders, agreed  in 309 to the creation of six military tribunes invested with the  consular power; but, which was an essential point, it was the interrex  who convoked the comitia and took the auspices.[116] During  seventy-seven years the military tribunes were elected alternately with  the consuls, and the consulship was only re-established permanently in  387, when it was opened to the plebeians. This was the result of one of  the laws of Licinius Stolo. This tribune succeeded in obtaining the  adoption of several measures which appeared to open a new era which  would put an end to disputes. Still the patricians held with such  tenacity to the privilege of alone taking the auspices, that in 398, in  the absence of the patrician consul, an interrex was appointed charged  with presiding over the comitia, in order not to leave this care to the  dictator, and the other consul, who were both plebeians.[117]    But in permitting the popular class to arrive at the consulship, care  had been taken to withdraw from that dignity a great part of its  attributes, in order to confer them upon patrician magistrates. Thus  they had successively taken away from the consuls, by the creation of  two questors, in 307, the administration of the military chest;[118] by  the creation of the censors, in 311, the right of drawing up the list of  the census, the assessment of the revenue of the State, and of watching  over public morals; by the creation of the praetors, in 387, the  sovereign jurisdiction in civil affairs, under the pretext that the  nobility alone possessed the knowledge of the law of the Quirites; and  lastly, by the creation of the curule ediles, the presidency of the  games, the superintendence of buildings, the police and the provisioning  of the town, the maintenance of the public roads, and the inspection of  the markets.    The intention of the aristocracy had been to limit the compulsory  concessions; but after the adoption of the Licinian laws, it was no  longer possible to prevent the principle of the admission of plebeians  to all the magistracies. In 386 they had arrived at the important charge  of master of the knights (_magister equitum_) who was in a manner the  lieutenant of the dictator (_magister populi_);[119] in 387 access to  the religious functions had been laid open to them;[120] in 345 they  obtained the questorship; in 398, the dictatorship itself; in 403, the  censorship; and lastly, in 417, the praetorship.    In 391, the people arrogated the right of appointing a part of the  legionary tribunes, previously chosen by the consuls.[121]    In 415, the law of Q. Publilius Philo took from the Senate the power of  refusing the _auctoritas_ to the laws voted by the comitia, and obliged  it to declare in advance if the proposed law were in conformity with  public and religious law. Further, the obligation imposed by this law of  having always one censor taken from among the plebeians, opened the  doors of the Senate to the richest of them, since it was the business of  the censor to fix the rank of the citizens, and pronounce on the  admission or exclusion of the senators. The Publilian law thus tended to  raise the aristocracy of the two orders to the same rank, and to create  the nobility (_nobilitas_), composed of all the families rendered  illustrious by the offices they had filled.      [Sidenote: Elements of Dissolution.]    IV. At the beginning of the fifth century of Rome, the bringing nearer  together of the two orders had given a greater consistence to society;  but, just as we have seen under the kingly rule, the principles begin to  show themselves which were one day to make the greatness of Rome, so now  we see the first appearance of dangers which will be renewed  unceasingly. Electoral corruption, the law of perduellio, slavery, the  increase of the poor class, the agrarian laws, and the question of  debts, will come, under different circumstances, to threaten the  existence of the Republic. Let us summarily state that these questions,  so grave in the sequel, were raised at an early date.    ELECTORAL CORRUPTION.--Fraud found its way into the elections as soon as  the number of electors increased and rendered it necessary to collect  more suffrages to obtain public charges; as early as 396, indeed, a law  on solicitation, proposed by the tribune of the people, C. Poetelius,  bears witness to the existence of electoral corruption.    LAW OF HIGH-TREASON.--As early as 305 and 369, the application of the  law of perduellio, or design against the Republic, furnished to  arbitrary power an arm of which, at a later period, under the emperors,  so deplorable a use was made under the name of the law of  high-treason.[122]    SLAVERY.--Slavery presented serious dangers for society, for, on the one  hand, it tended, by the lower price of manual labour, to substitute  itself for the labour of free men; while, on the other, discontented  with their lot, the slaves were always ready to shake off the yoke and  become the auxiliaries of all who were ambitious. In 253, 294, and 336,  partial insurrections announced the condition already to be feared of a  class disinherited of all the advantages, though intimately bound up  with all the wants, of ordinary life.[123] The number of slaves  increased rapidly. They replaced the free men torn by the continual  wars from the cultivation of the land. At a later period, when these  latter returned to their homes, the Senate was obliged to support them  by sending as far as Sicily to seek wheat to deliver to them either  gratis or at a reduced price.[124]    AGRARIAN LAWS.--As to the Agrarian laws and the question of debts, they  soon became an incessant cause of agitation.    The kings, with the conquered lands, had formed a domain of the State  (_ager publicus_), one of its principal resources,[125] and generously  distributed part of it to the poor citizens.[126] Generally, they took  from the conquered peoples two-thirds of their land.[127] Of these  two-thirds, \"the cultivated part,\" says Appian, \"was always adjudged to  the new colonists, either as a gratuitous grant, or by sale, or by lease  paying rent. As to the uncultivated part, which, as a consequence of  war, was almost always the most considerable, it was not the custom to  distribute it, but the enjoyment of it was left to any one willing to  clear and cultivate it, with a reservation to the State of the tenth  part of the harvest and a fifth part of the fruits. A similar tax was  levied upon those who bred cattle, large or small (in order to prevent  the pasture land from increasing in extent to the detriment of the  arable land). This was done in view of the increase of the Italic  population, which was judged at Rome the most laborious, and to have  allies of their own race. But the measure produced a result contrary to  that which was expected from it. The rich appropriated to themselves the  greatest part of the undistributed lands, and reckoning that the long  duration of their occupation would permit nobody to expel them, they  bought when they found a seller, or took by force from their  neighbouring lesser proprietors their modest "]]]
