[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#7)"],[1,"    After referring to the numerous, lengthy, intricate and even  contradictory legendary statements of the American aborigines which  in full may only be learned from the elaborate works of Brasseur de  Bourbourg, Lord Kingsborough, and H. H. Bancroft--P. De Roo remarks:        It is the universal opinion of the learned that Quetzalcohuatl is      identically the same personage with the contemporary religious and      civil reformer whom various nations have deified under different      names; that he is the same with Huemac or Vemac, as the Mexicans      also called him; with Topilitzin, as he was more anciently known      in Tulla by the Toltecs; with Wixipecocha, under whose name he was      venerated by the Zapotecs; with Zamna, Cozas, or Cukulcan, the      theocratic ruler of Yucatan; nay, with Bochica, the civilizer of      Cundinamarca of New Granada, and with Viracocha of Peru.    In the remainder of the quotation from our author, he speaks of this  one person under his various names and titles:        Quetzalcohuatl arrived at Tulla, the Toltec capital, from Panuco,      a small place on the Gulf of Mexico, where he had first landed.      Duran likewise relates that Topilitzin was a foreigner, but could      not learn from what parts he had come. His name, given him by the      natives, signified \"Beautiful feathered serpent.\" Culkulcan, his      Maya or Yucatec appellation, had exactly the same meaning. It was      the name of princes and Toltec kings, and probably designates      some honorable title, which, if we should make a few learned      considerations, might be found to be the Great or the Glorious      man of the country. * * * * * * The Indians remembered well that      their god Quetzalcohuatl had not been like one of themselves. They      described him as a white or pale faced man, of portly person, with      broad forehead, great eyes, long black hair, and a heavy rounded      beard. The Zapotecan Wixipecocha was also a white-skinned apostle,      and the Toltecan Topilitzin is described as having all the same      features, to which Duran adds that his beard was of a fair color      and his nose rather large. He was very reserved in his manners,      plain and meek with those who approached him, passing most of his      time in meditation and prayer in his cell, and showing himself but      seldom to the people. * * * * * * * * Very abstemious at all times,      Topilitzen often observed long and rigorous fasts, practicing      severe penances and even bloody self-chastisements, as is likewise      stated of the homologous Quetzalcohuatl.        De las Casas testifies that Quetzalcohuatl lived a most honest and      chaste life; Sahagun, that he never married nor ever was in the      company of a woman, except in the act of auricular confession.      While, according to traditional report, he was born of a virgin      mother. Herrea states that he remained a virgin himself. The      Yucatec legends also notice the celibacy of Cukulcan and his      general purity of morals. * * * Quetzalcohuatl is described as      having worn during life, for the sake of modesty, a garment that      reached down to his feet. * * * * * For shoes, Cukulcan wore      sandals, walked along bare-headed; nor is it said that his mantle      was, like that of his equivalent Wexipecocha, provided with a      monk's cowl for head-gear. From the Mexican traditions we learn      that Quetzalcohuatl, also, wore a cloak, which Bancroft calls a      blanket over all, in one place, and a long white robe, in another;      adding that, according to Gormara, it was decorated with crosses.      [24]    It would be impossible within the proposed limits of this work to  quote at length what has been written of this mysterious personage of  the western world; whose character and career in so many respects are  like that of the Hebrew Messiah, as he appeared in the western world.  From this point I can only summarize and quote briefly respecting him,  leaving the reader interested in the subject to make larger research in  the works cited in the margins. [25]    And now first as to the personal appearance of Quetzalcohuatl:        He was a white man, of portly person, broad brow, great eyes, long      black hair, and large round head, or exceedingly chaste, and quiet      life, and of great moderation in all things. [26] * * * * * * * *      Quetzalcohuatl is said to be a white man (some gave him a bright,      red face), with a strong formation of body, broad forehead, large      eyes, black hair, and a heavy beard. He always wore a long white      robe; which, according to Gomara, was decorated with crosses. (J.      G. Muller quoted by Bancroft, Native Races, Vol. III., pp. 273,      274.)    In the Book of Mormon account of the advent of Messiah among the  Nephites there is no description given of his features or person. This,  upon first thought, may seem singular; and yet it is in strictest  harmony with human conduct in the presence of such an event. Over-awed  by the fact of the presence of a heavenly personage men are liable to  take no note of features or color of the eyes or hair or any details  of personal appearance. It is not until men are removed from the  awe-inspiring circumstance itself that they begin to think of details  connected with a heavenly apparition. I think it probable, therefore,  that not until after the Nephite accounts were written of the personal  ministrations of Jesus did those who beheld him begin to think out the  details of his personal appearance; hence we have no description of him  in their written annals, but we find it preserved--but perhaps with  more or less of error in it--in the traditions of the people.    As to his general character while on earth the following is of  importance:        This Quetzalcohuatl was god of the air, and as such had his temple,      of a round shape and very magnificent. He was made god of the air      for the mildness and gentleness of all his ways, not liking the      sharp and harsh measures to which the other gods were so strongly      inclined. It is to be said further that his life on earth was      marked by intensely religious characteristics; not only was he      devoted to the careful observance of all the old customary forms      of worship, but he himself ordained and appointed many new rites,      ceremonies, and festivals [27] for the adoration of the gods;      [28] and it is held for certain that he made the calendar. [29]      He had priests who were called Quequetzalcohua, that is to say      \"priests of the order of Quetzalcohuatl.\" [30] The memory of him      was engraved deeply upon the minds of the people, and it is said      that when barren women prayed and made sacrifices to him, children      were given them. [31] He was, as we have said, god of the winds,      and the power of causing them to blow was attributed to him as well      as the power of calming or causing their fury to cease. It was said      further that he swept the road, so that the gods called Tlaloques      could rain; this the people imagined because ordinarily a month      or more before the rains began there blew strong winds throughout      all New Spain. Quetzalcohuatl is described as having worn during      life, for the sake of modesty, garments that reached down to the      feet, with a blanket over all, sown with red crosses. The Cholulans      preserved certain green stones that had belonged to him, regarding      them with great veneration and esteeming them as relics. * * * *      * * He also arranged the calendar, and taught his subjects fit      religious ceremonies; preaching specially against human sacrifices,      and ordering offerings of fruits and flowers only. He would have      nothing to do with the wars, even covering his ears when the      subject was mentioned. His was a veritable golden age, as in the      time of Saturn; animals and even men lived in peace, the soil      produced the richest harvests without cultivation, and the grain      grew so large that a man found it trouble enough to carry one ear;      no cotton was dyed, as it grew of all colors, and fruits of all      kinds abounded. Everybody was rich and Quetzalcohuatl owned whole      palaces of gold, silver and precious stones. The air was filled      with the most pleasant aromas, and a host of finely feathered birds      filled the world with melody. [32]    So, too, the following:        Only Quetzalcohuatl among all the gods was pre-eminently called      Lord; in such sort, that when any one swore, saying, By our Lord,      he meant Quetzalcohuatl and no other; though there were many other      highly esteemed gods. For indeed the service of this god was      gentle, neither did he demand hard things, but light; and he taught      only virtue, abhorring all evil and hurt. Twenty years this good      deity remained in Cholula, then he passed away by the road he had      come, carrying with him four of the principal and most virtuous      youths of that city. He journeyed for a hundred and fifty leagues,      till he came to the sea, in a distant province called Goatzacoalco.      Here he took leave of his companions and sent them back to their      city, instructing them to tell their fellow citizens that a day      should come in which the white men would land upon their coasts,      by the way of the sea in which the sun rises; brethren of his and      having beards like his; and that they should rule that land. [33]      The Mexicans always waited for the accomplishment of this prophecy,      and when the Spaniards came they took them for the descendants of      their meek and gentle prophet, although, as Mendieta remarks with      some sarcasm, when they came to know them and to experience their      works, they thought otherwise. [34]    Relative to Quetzalcohuatl in his capacity of Deity I shall quote the  following passage from Lord Kingsborough's great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#7)"],[1,"which held the holy treasure; and  upon reaching it, he saw the rounded top of a stone peeping from the  ground, while all the edges were encased in the earth. He speedily  moved the surface soil, and with the aid of a lever raised the stone,  which proved to be the covering of a rock cavity or box. Into this box  he looked, and found that it did indeed contain the promised plates of  gold and the Urim and Thummim.    Joseph could see that the box had been fashioned by cementing stones  together to form the bottom and sides; while the rock which he had  lifted away, beveled thin at the edges but thick and rounded at the  center, had formed a close-fitting cover to the sacred receptacle.  Within and across each end of the bottom of the box lay a stone; and  upon these the plates and other treasures rested.    Carried away for a moment by admiration and his eager desire to learn  further, Joseph stretched forth his hands to remove the records, but  instantly the messenger was by his side and stayed his touch. Moroni  informed him that four years must elapse before he could be permitted  to hold and examine the contents of the box; in the meantime he must  prove faithful as he had proved in the past, and on each succeeding  anniversary of that day, during the intervening years, he must appear  at the spot to view the sacred records, renew his covenants and be  instructed from the Lord.    Many precious truths the angel now imparted to him: telling him that  he, Moroni, while yet living, had hidden up the plates in the hill,  four centuries after Christ, to await their coming forth in the  destined hour of God's mercy to man; that he, Moroni, was the son of  Mormon, a prophet of the ancient Nephites, who had once dwelt on this  land; that to the Nephites this sacred hill was known as Cumorah,  and to the Jaredites (who had still more anciently inhabited this  continent), as Ramah; and much more did he impart to Joseph concerning  the mysteries of the past, and the future purposes of Almighty God in  the redemption of fallen mankind.    Then the kingdom of Heaven, in all its majesty, and the dominion of the  Prince of darkness, in all its terror, were brought to Joseph's vision,  and Moroni said:    \"ALL THIS IS SHOWN, THE GOOD AND THE EVIL, THE HOLY AND THE IMPURE, THE  GLORY OF GOD AND THE POWER OF DARKNESS, THAT YOU MAY KNOW HEREAFTER THE  TWO POWERS, AND NEVER BE INFLUENCED OR OVERCOME BY THAT WICKED ONE.\"    Joseph restored the cover to the box and replaced the earth; and when  the Heavenly messenger had ended the counsel and disappeared, the youth  again sought his home, marveling greatly at the goodness and infinite  power of his Creator.    Happily for the comfort of the chosen Prophet, at this hour he met  help within the family circle. He imparted to his parents and the  older children all that he had been empowered to reveal; and their  understanding and faith were quickened to the acceptance of the truth.  They learned to know of a surety that God had spoken and that Joseph  must obey.    On each recurrence of the twenty-second day of September during the  next three years, Joseph visited the hill Cumorah. Each time he opened  the box, viewed its precious contents, and then restored the hiding  place to its former appearance. Each time, the messenger visited him  on that consecrated spot; chastening him to patience, exacting anew a  covenant of self-sacrificing fidelity to the trust, and extending the  counsels and instructions pertaining to the re-establishment, at the  proper hour, of the Church of Christ upon the earth.    This continued communion wrought God's purpose with Joseph. It gave  him a comprehension of the destiny of man, both earthly and eternal;  unfolding to his view the progression of his race, from heaven  through the probation of this world and back to the judgment seat of  Omnipotence. It filled him with a burning zeal, and a higher wisdom  than that taught in the schools began to expand his intellect; he  was learning the sublime principle of just government; he was being  fitted to become the instrument to re-establish the Church which should  endure until the coming of Christ to reign therein in glory. Out of  His all-compassing power, the Lord gave to this unlearned youth, from  year to year, knowledge according to the hour of his need; and the  bestowal of this heavenly wisdom was continued to Joseph through all  the vicissitudes of the mortality which culminated in that awful day at  Carthage.    Footnotes    1. See NOTE 2., APPENDIX.        CHAPTER VI.    JOSEPH'S WILLING TOIL--FOUR YEARS OF WAITING--HE FINDS WORK IN  PENNSYLVANIA--HIS MARRIAGE WITH EMMA HALE--THE PROBATION COMPLETED.    When Joseph first stood upon the sacred hill Cumorah, he was in his  eighteenth year. The time in which the human character most strongly  assumes its shaping was to be with him the ensuing four years.    Wondrous as had been the vision of the host of Heaven and the ranks of  Lucifer; exalting as were the communications from the Lord; mighty as  was to be the mission of translation; yet Joseph had day by day the  humble labors of life to perform. Without a murmur he accepted his lot  of toil, working with his hands to aid in the family maintenance, while  his mind was busy with eternal truths. There is always a heroism in the  honest, uncomplaining home-toil of youth: a necessary heroism, indeed,  for without the early-formed habit of industry for man, the Almighty's  purposes concerning mankind would fail. And that heroism is doubly  beautiful in the life of Joseph, who knew already his destiny, divinely  ordained. Left much to itself in the selfishness of earth, a weaker or  an unsustained soul would have wasted its powers in vain dreamings or  found its destruction in pride and self-glory.    The sweat of the face, therefore, was at once a necessity and  a salutation: a requisite for the family welfare and comfort;  a protection from enervating dreams. No husbandman of all that  neighborhood was more industrious than he; and, except for the hatred  bred against him by false teachers and their followers, no one would  have had a better reputation.    As the younger sons of the family grew into vigor, the small farm and  the home duties less exacted the diligence of Joseph; and when an  opportunity came, in his twentieth year, for remunerative employment  at a distance, he willingly accepted the offer. The engagement carried  him to Susquehanna County, State of Pennsylvania, where the employer,  Josiah Stoal, though dwelling in New York State, had some property  upon which Joseph worked, while he boarded at the neighboring house of  Mr. Isaac Hale. Stoal conceived the idea that there were signs of a  silver deposit in his land, and he put his farming men to the work of  mining. It was soon evident that he had become infatuated with the hope  of achieving sudden and extraordinary wealth and was squandering his  means in a pursuit which gave no promise of an adequate return. Joseph,  who had become a favorite with Mr. Stoal because of industry and good  judgment, remonstrated with him, and finally influenced him to withdraw  from his sordid and fruitless project.    Isaac Hale had a daughter, Emma, a good girl of high mind and  devout feelings. This worthy young woman and Joseph formed a mutual  attachment, and her father was requested to give his permission to  their marriage. Mr. Hale opposed their desire for a time, as he was  prosperous while Joseph's people had lost their property; and it was  on the 18th day of January, 1827, the last year of waiting for the  plates, before Joseph and Emma could accomplish their desired union.  On that day they were married by one Squire Tarbill, at the residence  of that gentleman, in South Bainbridge, in Chenango County, New York.  Immediately after the marriage, Joseph left the employ of Mr. Stoal  and journeyed with his wife to his parental home at Manchester, where  during the succeeding summer, he worked to obtain means for his family  and his mission. The time was near at hand for the great promise to be  fulfilled and for his patience and faithfulness to be rewarded.    As the hour approached for the delivery of the ancient record into his  hands, Joseph prayed earnestly for humility and strength. He had not  failed in any of his prescribed visits to Cumorah. Even when at work in  Pennsylvania, he had obtained temporary release that he might journey  to the hill and meet his Heavenly teacher.    His wife, his parents and brethren were made participants in his hopes,  and they added their faith to his, and gave their hearty support to his  labor and preparation.    The 21st day of September, 1827, completed the fourth year since  Moroni first appeared at Joseph's bedside, and the occasion was  deemed a fitting hour for prayer and thanksgiving. In that humble  home God's chosen servant and his kindred offered their adoration  to the beneficent Father. It was also a time for the review of the  trying years since the call first came to Joseph. The family had  remained in honest lowliness, unmoved by the assaults and ridicule of  the world. Alvin, the eldest son of Joseph and Lucy, had died on the  19th of November, 1824, with a firm belief in the coming of the New  Dispensation and with words of comfort and blessing for his brother  Joseph upon his lips. The faithful Hyrum, like Joseph, was happily wed.  And the younger children were nearly all at years of understanding.    Quiet came with the darkness, and peace dwelt upon the house and by  the pillows of this devoted family. The tranquility of the night was  long remembered, for it was almost the last time they had on earth in  unfearing and undisturbed enjoyment of each other's society.        CHAPTER VII.
