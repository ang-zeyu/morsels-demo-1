Then he is ours.            [_Both seize hold of the prisoner, who struggles          violently, and drag him towards the shaft by which          they descended. They disappear mounting upwards._          FOURTH SCENE              _The scene has changed as before, only in reverse          order. Open space on mountain heights. The prospect          is veiled by pale mist as at the end of the second          scene. Wotan and Loge climb up out of the cavern,          bringing with them Alberich bound._        LOGE          Here, kinsman,        Thou canst sit down!        Friend, look round thee;        There lies the world    That was thine for the winning, thou fool!        What corner, say,    Wilt give to me for my stall?            [_He dances round Alberich, snapping his fingers._    ALBERICH          Infamous robber!        Thou knave! Thou rogue!        Loosen the rope,        Set me at large,    Or dear for this outrage shalt answer!    WOTAN          My captive art thou,        Caught and in fetters.        As thou hadst fain        Subdued the world    And all that the world containeth,    Thou liest bound at my feet,    And, coward, canst not deny it.        A ransom alone        Shall loose thee from bondage.    ALBERICH          Ah, the dolt,        The dreamer I was,        To trust blindly        The treacherous thief!        Fearful revenge        Shall follow this wrong!    LOGE          Vain talk this of vengeance    Before thy freedom is won.        To a man in bonds    No free man expiates outrage.        If vengeance thou dreamest,        Dream of the ransom    First without further delay!            [_He shows him the kind of ransom by snapping his          fingers._    ALBERICH      Declare then your demands.    WOTAN      The hoard and thy gleaming gold.    ALBERICH      Pack of unscrupulous thieves!            [_Aside._      If I only can keep the ring,    The hoard I can lightly let go,        For anew I could win it        And add to its worth    By the powerful spell of the ring.        If as warning it serves        To make me more wise,    The warning will not have been lost,    Even though lost may be the gold.    WOTAN          Wilt yield up the hoard?    ALBERICH         Loosen my hand       To summon it here.            [_Loge frees his right hand._    ALBERICH            [_Touches the ring with his lips and secretly          murmurs the command._          Behold the Nibelungs        Hither are called;        I can hear them coming,        Bid by their lord,    With the hoard from the depths to the day.    Now loosen these burdensome bonds.    WOTAN          Nay, first in full thou must pay.            [_The Nibelungs come up out of the cleft laden with          the objects of which the hoard is composed._    ALBERICH          O bitter disgrace        That my shrinking bondsmen    Should see me captive and bound!            [_To the Nibelungs._          Lay it down there,        As ye are bid!        In a heap        Pile up the hoard.        Must I aid, idlers?        No spying at me!        Haste there! Haste!        Then get ye gone quickly.        Hence to your work.        Home to your gorges!    Let the sluggards beware,    For I follow hard at your heels!            [_He kisses the ring and holds it out with an air          of command. As struck with a blow, the Nibelungs          press terrified and cowering towards the cleft,          down which they hastily disappear._    ALBERICH          The price is paid;        Let me depart!        And that helm of mine        Which Loge still holds,    That also pray give me again!    LOGE            _Throwing the Tarnhelm on to the heap._      The plunder must pay for the pardon.    ALBERICH          Accursed thief!        But patience! Calm!        He who moulded the one        Makes me another;        Still mine is the might        That Mime obeys.        Loath indeed        Am I to leave    My cunning defence to the foe!        Nothing Alberich        Owns at all now;    Unbind, ye tyrants, his bonds!    LOGE [_To Wotan._          Ought I to free him?        Art thou content?    WOTAN          A golden ring        Girdles thy finger:        Hearest, elf?    That also belongs to the hoard.    ALBERICH  [_Horrified._          The ring?    WOTAN         The ring must also       Go to the ransom.    ALBERICH [_Trembling._         My life--but the ring: not that!    WOTAN [_With greater violence._          The ring I covet;    For thy life I care not at all.    ALBERICH      But if my life I ransom    The ring I must also rescue        Hand and head,        Eye and ear    Are not mine more truly    Than mine is the ruddy ring!    WOTAN      The ring thou claimest as thine?    Impudent elf, thou art raving.        Tell the truth;        Whence was gotten the gold    To fashion the glittering gaud?        How could that be        Thine which reft was,    Thou rogue, from watery deeps?        To the Rhine's fair daughters        Down and inquire        If the gold        Was as gift to thee given    That thou didst thieve for the ring!    ALBERICH          Vile double-dealing!        Shameless deceit!        Wouldst thou, robber,        Reproach in me    The sin so sweet to thyself?        How fain thou hadst    Bereft the Rhine of its gold,        If it had been    As easy to forge as to steal!        How well for thee,        Thou unctuous knave,        That the Nibelung, stung        By shameful defeat,        And by fury driven,    Was fired into winning the spell    That now alluringly smiles!        Shall I, bliss debarred,        Anguish-burdened        Because of the        Curse-laden deed,        My ring as a toy    Grant to princes for pleasure,    My ban bringing blessing to thee?        Have a care,        Arrogant God!        My sin was one    Concerning myself alone:    But against all that was,        Is and shall be    Thou wouldst wantonly sin,    Eternal one, taking the ring.    WOTAN          Yield the ring!        Thy foolish talk    Gives no title to that.            [_He seizes Alberich and draws the ring from his          finger by force._    ALBERICH  [_With a frightful cry._        Woe! Defeated! Undone!      Of wretches the wretchedest slave!    WOTAN [_Contemplating the ring._        I own what makes me supreme,      The mightiest lord of all lords!            [_He puts on the ring._    LOGE [_To Wotan._        Shall he go free?    WOTAN        Loose his bonds.    LOGE [_Sets Alberich quite free._          Slip away home,        For no fetter binds thee!    Fare forth, thou art free!    ALBERICH [_Raising himself with furious laughter._          Am I now free,        Free in truth?        My freedom's first    Greeting take, for it is thine!    As a curse gave me the ring,    My curse go with the ring!        As its gold    Gave measureless might,        May now its magic    Deal death evermore!        No man shall gain        Gladness therefrom;        May ill-fortune befall him        On whom it shines.        Fretted by care        Be he who shall hold it,        And he who doth not,        By envy be gnawed!        All shall covet        And crave its wealth,        Yet none shall it profit        Or pay when won.    Those who guard it nothing shall gain,    Yet shall murder go where they go.        The coward, death-doomed,    By fetters of fear shall be bound;        His whole life long    He shall languish to death--        The ring's proud lord        And its poorest slave--        Till again I have    In my hand the gold I was robbed of.        So blesses        The Nibelung    The ring in bitter despair!        Hold fast to it!            [Laughing.        Keep it with care;            [Grimly.        From my curse none shall escape!            [_He vanishes quickly through the cleft. The thick          mist in the foreground gradually clears away._    LOGE           Hadst thou ears         For his fond farewell?    WOTAN [_Left in contemplation of the ring._      Grudge him not vent to his spleen!            [_It keeps growing lighter._    LOGE [_Looking to the right._          Fasolt and Fafner        Come from afar    Bringing Freia again.            [_Through the vanishing mist Donner, Froh, and          Fricka appear, and hasten towards the foreground._    FROH          The giants return.    DONNER          Be greeted, brother!    FRICKA [_Anxiously to Wotan._          Dost bring joyful tidings?    LOGE [_Pointing to the hoard._          By fraud and by force        We have prevailed:    There Freia's ransom lies.    DONNER          From the giant's grasp        Freed comes the fair one.    FROH          How sweetly the air        Fans us again!        Balmy delights        Steal soft through each sense!
