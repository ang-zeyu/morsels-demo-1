In a letter to her son written in 1886, speaking of this period of her  life, Mrs. Stowe says: \"Somewhere between my twelfth and thirteenth  year I was placed under the care of my elder sister Catherine, in the  school that she had just started in Hartford, Connecticut. When I  entered the school there were not more than twenty-five scholars in it,  but it afterwards numbered its pupils by the hundreds. The school-room  was on Main Street, nearly opposite Christ Church, over Sheldon &  Colton's harness store, at the sign of the two white horses. I never  shall forget the pleasure and surprise which these two white horses  produced in my mind when I first saw them. One of the young men who  worked in the rear of the harness store had a most beautiful tenor  voice, and it was my delight to hear him singing in school hours:--    [Illustration: Catherine E. Beecher]        'When in cold oblivion's shade       Beauty, wealth, and power are laid,       When, around the sculptured shrine,       Moss shall cling and ivy twine,       Where immortal spirits reign,       There shall we all meet again.'    \"As my father's salary was inadequate to the wants of his large family,  the expense of my board in Hartford was provided for by a species of  exchange. Mr. Isaac D. Bull sent a daughter to Miss Pierce's seminary  in Litchfield, and she boarded in my father's family in exchange for  my board in her father's family. If my good, refined, neat, particular  stepmother could have chosen, she could not have found a family more  exactly suited to her desires. The very soul of neatness and order  pervaded the whole establishment. Mr. I. D. Bull was a fine, vigorous,  white-haired man on the declining slope of life, but full of energy  and of kindness. Mr. Samuel Collins, a neighbor who lived next door,  used to frequently come in and make most impressive and solemn calls on  Miss Mary Anne Bull, who was a brunette and a celebrated beauty of the  day. I well remember her long raven curls falling from the comb that  held them up on the top of her head. She had a rich soprano voice, and  was the leading singer in the Centre Church choir. The two brothers  also had fine, manly voices, and the family circle was often enlivened  by quartette singing and flute playing. Mr. Bull kept a very large  wholesale drug store on Front Street, in which his two sons, Albert  and James, were clerks. The oldest son, Watson Bull, had established a  retail drug store at the sign of the 'Good Samaritan.' A large picture  of the Good Samaritan relieving the wounded traveler formed a striking  part of the sign, and was contemplated by me with reverence.    \"The mother of the family gave me at once a child's place in her heart.  A neat little hall chamber was allotted to me for my own, and a well  made and kept single bed was given me, of which I took daily care with  awful satisfaction. If I was sick nothing could exceed the watchful  care and tender nursing of Mrs. Bull. In school my two most intimate  friends were the leading scholars. They had written to me before I  came and I had answered their letters, and on my arrival they gave me  the warmest welcome. One was Catherine Ledyard Cogswell, daughter of  the leading and best-beloved of Hartford physicians. The other was  Georgiana May, daughter of a most lovely Christian woman who was a  widow. Georgiana was one of many children, having two younger sisters,  Mary and Gertrude, and several brothers. Catherine Cogswell was one of  the most amiable, sprightly, sunny-tempered individuals I have ever  known. She was, in fact, so much beloved that it was difficult for  me to see much of her. Her time was all bespoken by different girls.  One might walk with her to school, another had the like promise on  the way home. And at recess, of which we had every day a short half  hour, there was always a suppliant at Katy's shrine, whom she found it  hard to refuse. Yet, among all these claimants, she did keep a little  place here and there for me. Georgiana was older and graver, and less  fascinating to the other girls, but between her and me there grew up  the warmest friendship, which proved lifelong in its constancy.    \"Catherine and Georgiana were reading 'Virgil' when I came to the  school. I began the study of Latin alone, and at the end of the first  year made a translation of 'Ovid' in verse, which was read at the final  exhibition of the school, and regarded, I believe, as a very creditable  performance. I was very much interested in poetry, and it was my dream  to be a poet. I began a drama called 'Cleon.' The scene was laid in the  court and time of the emperor Nero, and Cleon was a Greek lord residing  at Nero's court, who, after much searching and doubting, at last comes  to the knowledge of Christianity. I filled blank book after blank book  with this drama. It filled my thoughts sleeping and waking. One day  sister Catherine pounced down upon me, and said that I must not waste  my time writing poetry, but discipline my mind by the study of Butler's  'Analogy.' So after this I wrote out abstracts from the 'Analogy,' and  instructed a class of girls as old as myself, being compelled to master  each chapter just ahead of the class I was teaching. About this time I  read Baxter's 'Saint's Rest.' I do not think any book affected me more  powerfully. As I walked the pavements I used to wish that they might  sink beneath me if only I might find myself in heaven. I was at the  same time very much interested in Butler's 'Analogy,' for Mr. Brace  used to lecture on such themes when I was at Miss Pierce's school at  Litchfield. I also began the study of French and Italian with a Miss  Degan, who was born in Italy.    \"It was about this time that I first believed myself to be a Christian.  I was spending my summer vacation at home, in Litchfield. I shall  ever remember that dewy, fresh summer morning. I knew that it was a  sacramental Sunday, and thought with sadness that when all the good  people should take the sacrificial bread and wine I should be left  out. I tried hard to feel my sins and count them up; but what with the  birds, the daisies, and the brooks that rippled by the way, it was  impossible. I came into church quite dissatisfied with myself, and as  I looked upon the pure white cloth, the snowy bread and shining cups,  of the communion table, thought with a sigh: 'There won't be anything  for me to-day; it is all for these grown-up Christians.' Nevertheless,  when father began to speak, I was drawn to listen by a certain  pathetic earnestness in his voice. Most of father's sermons were as  unintelligible to me as if he had spoken in Choctaw. But sometimes he  preached what he was accustomed to call a 'frame sermon;' that is, a  sermon that sprung out of the deep feeling of the occasion, and which  consequently could be neither premeditated nor repeated. His text was  taken from the Gospel of John, the declaration of Jesus: 'Behold, I  call you no longer servants, but friends.' His theme was Jesus as a  soul friend offered to every human being.    \"Forgetting all his hair-splitting distinctions and dialectic  subtleties, he spoke in direct, simple, and tender language of the  great love of Christ and his care for the soul. He pictured Him as  patient with our errors, compassionate with our weaknesses, and  sympathetic for our sorrows. He went on to say how He was ever near  us, enlightening our ignorance, guiding our wanderings, comforting our  sorrows with a love unwearied by faults, unchilled by ingratitude, till  at last He should present us faultless before the throne of his glory  with exceeding joy.    \"I sat intent and absorbed. Oh! how much I needed just such a friend,  I thought to myself. Then the awful fact came over me that I had never  had any conviction of my sins, and consequently could not come to Him.  I longed to cry out 'I will,' when father made his passionate appeal,  'Come, then, and trust your soul to this faithful friend.' Like a flash  it came over me that if I needed conviction of sin, He was able to give  me even this also. I would trust Him for the whole. My whole soul was  illumined with joy, and as I left the church to walk home, it seemed to  me as if Nature herself were hushing her breath to hear the music of  heaven.    \"As soon as father came home and was seated in his study, I went up to  him and fell in his arms saying, 'Father, I have given myself to Jesus,  and He has taken me.' I never shall forget the expression of his face  as he looked down into my earnest, childish eyes; it was so sweet, so  gentle, and like sunlight breaking out upon a landscape. 'Is it so?' he  said, holding me silently to his heart, as I felt the hot tears fall on  my head. 'Then has a new flower blossomed in the kingdom this day.'\"    If she could have been let alone, and taught \"to look up and not down,  forward and not back, out and not in,\" this religious experience might  have gone on as sweetly and naturally as the opening of a flower in  the gentle rays of the sun. But unfortunately this was not possible  at that time, when self-examination was carried to an extreme that was  calculated to drive a nervous and sensitive mind well-nigh distracted.  First, even her sister Catherine was afraid that there might be  something wrong in the case of a lamb that had come into the fold  without being first chased all over the lot by the shepherd; great  stress being laid, in those days, on what was called \"being under  conviction.\" Then also the pastor of the First Church in Hartford, a  bosom friend of Dr. Beecher, looked with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#7)"],[1," be as well, perhaps, to return to the bank and resume our  commercial duties. I don't know how long you are supposed to be allowed  for your little trips to and from the post-office, but, seeing that the  distance is about thirty yards, I should say at a venture not more than  half an hour. Which is exactly the space of time which has flitted by  since we started out on this important expedition. Your devotion to  porridge, Comrade Jackson, has led to our spending about twenty-five  minutes in this hostelry.'    'Great Scott,' said Mike, 'there'll be a row.'    'Some slight temporary breeze, perhaps,' said Psmith. 'Annoying to men  of culture and refinement, but not lasting. My only fear is lest we may  have worried Comrade Rossiter at all. I regard Comrade Rossiter as an  elder brother, and would not cause him a moment's heart-burning for  worlds. However, we shall soon know,' he added, as they passed into the  bank and walked up the aisle, 'for there is Comrade Rossiter waiting to  receive us in person.'    The little head of the Postage Department was moving restlessly about  in the neighbourhood of Psmith's and Mike's desk.    'Am I mistaken,' said Psmith to Mike, 'or is there the merest suspicion  of a worried look on our chief's face? It seems to me that there is the  slightest soupcon of shadow about that broad, calm brow.'          7. Going into Winter Quarters      There was.    Mr Rossiter had discovered Psmith's and Mike's absence about five  minutes after they had left the building. Ever since then, he had been  popping out of his lair at intervals of three minutes, to see whether  they had returned. Constant disappointment in this respect had rendered  him decidedly jumpy. When Psmith and Mike reached the desk, he was a  kind of human soda-water bottle. He fizzed over with questions,  reproofs, and warnings.    'What does it mean? What does it mean?' he cried. 'Where have you been?  Where have you been?'    'Poetry,' said Psmith approvingly.    'You have been absent from your places for over half an hour. Why? Why?  Why? Where have you been? Where have you been? I cannot have this. It  is preposterous. Where have you been? Suppose Mr Bickersdyke had  happened to come round here. I should not have known what to say to  him.'    'Never an easy man to chat with, Comrade Bickersdyke,' agreed Psmith.    'You must thoroughly understand that you are expected to remain in your  places during business hours.'    'Of course,' said Psmith, 'that makes it a little hard for Comrade  Jackson to post letters, does it not?'    'Have you been posting letters?'    'We have,' said Psmith. 'You have wronged us. Seeing our absent places  you jumped rashly to the conclusion that we were merely gadding about  in pursuit of pleasure. Error. All the while we were furthering the  bank's best interests by posting letters.'    'You had no business to leave your place. Jackson is on the posting  desk.'    'You are very right,' said Psmith, 'and it shall not occur again. It  was only because it was the first day, Comrade Jackson is not used to  the stir and bustle of the City. His nerve failed him. He shrank from  going to the post-office alone. So I volunteered to accompany him.  And,' concluded Psmith, impressively, 'we won safely through. Every  letter has been posted.'    'That need not have taken you half an hour.'    'True. And the actual work did not. It was carried through swiftly and  surely. But the nerve-strain had left us shaken. Before resuming our  more ordinary duties we had to refresh. A brief breathing-space, a  little coffee and porridge, and here we are, fit for work once more.'    'If it occurs again, I shall report the matter to Mr Bickersdyke.'    'And rightly so,' said Psmith, earnestly. 'Quite rightly so.  Discipline, discipline. That is the cry. There must be no shirking of  painful duties. Sentiment must play no part in business. Rossiter, the  man, may sympathise, but Rossiter, the Departmental head, must be  adamant.'    Mr Rossiter pondered over this for a moment, then went off on a  side-issue.    'What is the meaning of this foolery?' he asked, pointing to Psmith's  gloves and hat. 'Suppose Mr Bickersdyke had come round and seen them,  what should I have said?'    'You would have given him a message of cheer. You would have said, \"All  is well. Psmith has not left us. He will come back. And Comrade  Bickersdyke, relieved, would have--\"'    'You do not seem very busy, Mr Smith.'    Both Psmith and Mr Rossiter were startled.    Mr Rossiter jumped as if somebody had run a gimlet into him, and even  Psmith started slightly. They had not heard Mr Bickersdyke approaching.  Mike, who had been stolidly entering addresses in his ledger during the  latter part of the conversation, was also taken by surprise.    Psmith was the first to recover. Mr Rossiter was still too confused for  speech, but Psmith took the situation in hand.    'Apparently no,' he said, swiftly removing his hat from the ruler. 'In  reality, yes. Mr Rossiter and I were just scheming out a line of work  for me as you came up. If you had arrived a moment later, you would  have found me toiling.'    'H'm. I hope I should. We do not encourage idling in this bank.'    'Assuredly not,' said Psmith warmly. 'Most assuredly not. I would not  have it otherwise. I am a worker. A bee, not a drone. A  _Lusitania,_ not a limpet. Perhaps I have not yet that grip on my  duties which I shall soon acquire; but it is coming. It is coming. I  see daylight.'    'H'm. I have only your word for it.' He turned to Mr Rossiter, who had  now recovered himself, and was as nearly calm as it was in his nature  to be. 'Do you find Mr Smith's work satisfactory, Mr Rossiter?'    Psmith waited resignedly for an outburst of complaint respecting the  small matter that had been under discussion between the head of the  department and himself; but to his surprise it did not come.    'Oh--ah--quite, quite, Mr Bickersdyke. I think he will very soon pick  things up.'    Mr Bickersdyke turned away. He was a conscientious bank manager, and  one can only suppose that Mr Rossiter's tribute to the earnestness of  one of his _employes_ was gratifying to him. But for that, one would have  said that he was disappointed.    'Oh, Mr Bickersdyke,' said Psmith.    The manager stopped.    'Father sent his kind regards to you,' said Psmith benevolently.    Mr Bickersdyke walked off without comment.    'An uncommonly cheery, companionable feller,' murmured Psmith, as he  turned to his work.      The first day anywhere, if one spends it in a sedentary fashion, always  seemed unending; and Mike felt as if he had been sitting at his desk  for weeks when the hour for departure came. A bank's day ends  gradually, reluctantly, as it were. At about five there is a sort of  stir, not unlike the stir in a theatre when the curtain is on the point  of falling. Ledgers are closed with a bang. Men stand about and talk  for a moment or two before going to the basement for their hats and  coats. Then, at irregular intervals, forms pass down the central aisle  and out through the swing doors. There is an air of relaxation over the  place, though some departments are still working as hard as ever under  a blaze of electric light. Somebody begins to sing, and an instant  chorus of protests and maledictions rises from all sides. Gradually,  however, the electric lights go out. The procession down the centre  aisle becomes more regular; and eventually the place is left to  darkness and the night watchman.    The postage department was one of the last to be freed from duty. This  was due to the inconsiderateness of the other departments, which  omitted to disgorge their letters till the last moment. Mike as he grew  familiar with the work, and began to understand it, used to prowl round  the other departments during the afternoon and wrest letters from them,  usually receiving with them much abuse for being a nuisance and not  leaving honest workers alone. Today, however, he had to sit on till  nearly six, waiting for the final batch of correspondence.    Psmith, who had waited patiently with him, though his own work was  finished, accompanied him down to the post office and back again to the  bank to return the letter basket; and they left the office together.    'By the way,' said Psmith, 'what with the strenuous labours of the bank  and the disturbing interviews with the powers that be, I have omitted  to ask you where you are digging. Wherever it is, of course you must  clear out. It is imperative, in this crisis, that we should be  together. I have acquired a quite snug little flat in Clement's Inn.  There is a spare bedroom. It shall be yours.'    'My dear chap,' said Mike, 'it's all rot. I can't sponge on you.'    'You pain me, Comrade Jackson. I was not suggesting such a thing. We  are business men, hard-headed young bankers. I make you a business  proposition. I offer you the post of confidential secretary and adviser  to me in exchange for a comfortable home. The duties will be light. You  will be required to refuse invitations to dinner from crowned heads,  and to listen attentively to my views on Life. Apart from this, there  is little to do. So that's settled.'    'It isn't,' said Mike. 'I--'    'You will enter upon your duties tonight. Where are you suspended at  present?'    'Dulwich. But, look here--'    'A little more, and you'll get the sack. I tell you the thing is  settled. Now, let us hail yon taximeter cab, and desire the stern-faced  aristocrat on the box to drive us to Dulwich. We will then collect a  few of your things in a bag, have the rest off by train, come back in  the taxi, and go and bite a chop at the Carlton. This is a momentous  day in our careers, Comrade Jackson. We must buoy ourselves up.'    Mike made no further objections. The thought of that bed-sitting room  in Acacia Road and the pantomime dame rose up and killed them. After  all, Psmith was not like any ordinary"]]]
