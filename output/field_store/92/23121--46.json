Then they were married at once, but the bridegroom  never lifted his visor and no one saw his face. The proud princess held  herself more proudly than ever, but she was as white as her veil. And  there was no laughter or merry-making, such as should be at a wedding,  and every one looked at every one else with fear in his eyes.    \"After the wedding the bridegroom lifted his bride before him on his  white horse, and her father and all the members of his court mounted,  too, and rode after them. On and on they rode, and the skies grew darker  and the wind blew and wailed, and the shades of evening came down. And  just in the twilight they rode into a dark valley, filled with tombs and  graves.    \"'Why have you brought me here?' cried the proud princess angrily.    \"'This is my kingdom,' he answered. 'These are the tombs of the kings I  have conquered. Behold me, beautiful princess. I am Death!'    \"He lifted his visor. All saw his awful face. The proud princess  shrieked.    \"'Come to my arms, my bride,' he cried. 'I have won you fairly. I am the  king who conquers all kings!'    \"He clasped her fainting form to his breast and spurred his white horse  to the tombs. A tempest of rain broke over the valley and blotted them  from sight. Very sadly the old king and courtiers rode home, and never,  never again did human eye behold the proud princess. But when those  long, white clouds sweep across the sky, the country people in the land  where she lived say, 'Look you, there is the Wedding Veil of the Proud  Princess.'\"    The weird spell of the tale rested on us for some moments after the  Story Girl had finished. We had walked with her in the place of death  and grown cold with the horror that chilled the heart of the poor  princess. Dan presently broke the spell.    \"You see it doesn't do to be too proud, Felicity,\" he remarked, giving  her a poke. \"You'd better not say too much about Peter's patches.\"        CHAPTER V. PETER GOES TO CHURCH    There was no Sunday School the next afternoon, as superintendent and  teachers wished to attend a communion service at Markdale. The Carlisle  service was in the evening, and at sunset we were waiting at Uncle  Alec's front door for Peter and the Story Girl.    None of the grown-ups were going to church. Aunt Olivia had a sick  headache and Uncle Roger stayed home with her. Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec  had gone to the Markdale service and had not yet returned.    Felicity and Cecily were wearing their new summer muslins for the first  time--and were acutely conscious of the fact. Felicity, her pink and  white face shadowed by her drooping, forget-me-not-wreathed, leghorn  hat, was as beautiful as usual; but Cecily, having tortured her hair  with curl papers all night, had a rampant bush of curls all about her  head which quite destroyed the sweet, nun-like expression of her little  features. Cecily cherished a grudge against fate because she had not  been given naturally curly hair as had the other two girls. But she  attained the desire of her heart on Sundays at least, and was quite  well satisfied. It was impossible to convince her that the satin smooth  lustre of her week-day tresses was much more becoming to her.    Presently Peter and the Story Girl appeared, and we were all more or  less relieved to see that Peter looked quite respectable, despite the  indisputable patch on his trousers. His face was rosy, his thick black  curls were smoothly combed, and his tie was neatly bowed; but it was his  legs which we scrutinized most anxiously. At first glance they seemed  well enough; but closer inspection revealed something not altogether  customary.    \"What is the matter with your stockings, Peter?\" asked Dan bluntly.    \"Oh, I hadn't a pair without holes in the legs,\" answered Peter easily,  \"because ma hadn't time to darn them this week. So I put on two pairs.  The holes don't come in the same places, and you'd never notice them  unless you looked right close.\"    \"Have you got a cent for collection?\" demanded Felicity.    \"I've got a Yankee cent. I s'pose it will do, won't it?\"    Felicity shook her head vehemently.    \"Oh, no, no. It may be all right to pass a Yankee cent on a store keeper  or an egg peddler, but it would never do for church.\"    \"I'll have to go without any, then,\" said Peter. \"I haven't another  cent. I only get fifty cents a week and I give it all to ma last night.\"    But Peter must have a cent. Felicity would have given him one  herself--and she was none too lavish of her coppers--rather than  have him go without one. Dan, however, lent him one, on the distinct  understanding that it was to be repaid the next week.    Uncle Roger wandered by at this moment and, beholding Peter, said,    \"'Is Saul also among the prophets?' What can have induced you to turn  church-goer, Peter, when all Olivia's gentle persuasions were of no  avail? The old, old argument I suppose--'beauty draws us with a single  hair.'\"    Uncle Roger looked quizzically at Felicity. We did not know what his  quotations meant, but we understood he thought Peter was going to church  because of Felicity. Felicity tossed her head.    \"It isn't my fault that he's going to church,\" she said snappishly.  \"It's the Story Girl's doings.\"    Uncle Roger sat down on the doorstep, and gave himself over to one  of the silent, inward paroxysms of laughter we all found so very  aggravating. He shook his big, blond head, shut his eyes, and murmured,    \"Not her fault! Oh, Felicity, Felicity, you'll be the death of your dear  Uncle yet if you don't watch out.\"    Felicity started off indignantly, and we followed, picking up Sara Ray  at the foot of the hill.    The Carlisle church was a very old-fashioned one, with a square,  ivy-hung tower. It was shaded by tall elms, and the graveyard surrounded  it completely, many of the graves being directly under its windows. We  always took the corner path through it, passing the King plot where our  kindred of four generations slept in a green solitude of wavering light  and shadow.    There was Great-grandfather King's flat tombstone of rough Island  sandstone, so overgrown with ivy that we could hardly read its lengthy  inscription, recording his whole history in brief, and finishing with  eight lines of original verse composed by his widow. I do not think that  poetry was Great-grandmother King's strong point. When Felix read it, on  our first Sunday in Carlisle, he remarked dubiously that it LOOKED like  poetry but didn't SOUND like it.    There, too, slept the Emily whose faithful spirit was supposed to haunt  the orchard; but Edith who had kissed the poet lay not with her kindred.  She had died in a far, foreign land, and the murmur of an alien sea  sounded about her grave.    White marble tablets, ornamented with weeping willow trees, marked where  Grandfather and Grandmother King were buried, and a single shaft of  red Scotch granite stood between the graves of Aunt Felicity and Uncle  Felix. The Story Girl lingered to lay a bunch of wild violets, misty  blue and faintly sweet, on her mother's grave; and then she read aloud  the verse on the stone.    \"'They were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they  were not divided.'\"    The tones of her voice brought out the poignant and immortal beauty and  pathos of that wonderful old lament. The girls wiped their eyes; and  we boys felt as if we might have done so, too, had nobody been looking.  What better epitaph could any one wish than to have it said that he was  lovely and pleasant in his life? When I heard the Story Girl read it I  made a secret compact with myself that I would try to deserve such an  epitaph.    \"I wish I had a family plot,\" said Peter, rather wistfully. \"I haven't  ANYTHING you fellows have. The Craigs are just buried anywhere they  happen to die.\"    \"I'd like to be buried here when I die,\" said Felix. \"But I hope it  won't be for a good while yet,\" he added in a livelier tone, as we moved  onward to the church.    The interior of the church was as old-fashioned as its exterior. It was  furnished with square box pews; the pulpit was a \"wine-glass\" one, and  was reached by a steep, narrow flight of steps. Uncle Alec's pew was at  the top of the church, quite near the pulpit.    Peter's appearance did not attract as much attention as we had fondly  expected. Indeed, nobody seemed to notice him at all. The lamps were  not yet lighted and the church was filled with a soft twilight and hush.  Outside, the sky was purple and gold and silvery green, with a delicate  tangle of rosy cloud above the elms.    \"Isn't it awful nice and holy in here?\" whispered Peter reverently. \"I  didn't know church was like this. It's nice.\"    Felicity frowned at him, and the Story Girl touched her with her  slippered foot to remind him that he must not talk in church. Peter  stiffened up and sat at attention during the service. Nobody could have  behaved better. But when the sermon was over and the collection was  being taken up, he made the sensation which his entrance had not  produced.    Elder Frewen, a tall, pale man, with long, sandy side-whiskers, appeared  at the door of our pew with the collection plate. We knew Elder Frewen  quite well and liked him; he was Aunt Janet's cousin and often visited  her. The contrast between his week-day jollity and the unearthly  solemnity of his countenance on Sundays always struck us as very funny.  It seemed so to strike Peter; for as Peter dropped his cent into the  plate he laughed aloud!    Everybody looked at our pew. I have always wondered why Felicity did  not die of mortification on the spot. The Story Girl turned white, and  Cecily turned red. As for that poor, unlucky Peter, the shame of his  countenance was pitiful to behold. He never lifted his head for the  remainder of the service; and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53499"],[0,"Martin Luther (#7)"],[1,"April 17          Makes first statement           April 18          Luther will not recant           April 26          Leaves Worms           May 4             Arrives at the Wartburg           May 26            Banned by Edict of Worms    1522   March 6           Returns to Wittenberg    1525   June 13           Marries Katherine von Bora    1527                     Composition of \"A Mighty Fortress\"    1530   June 25           Augsburg Confession read    1534                     Publishes complete Bible in German    1546   February 18       Luther dies at Eisleben                                    Transcriber's Notes      --Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook    is public-domain in the country of publication.    --Corrected a few palpable typographical errors.    --In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by    _underscores_."]]]
