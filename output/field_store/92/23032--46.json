[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#7)"],[1," of this putting the one on the  other. And we shall experience it most strongly when we are shown the  soul TANTALISED by the needs of the body: on the one hand, the moral  personality with its intelligently varied energy, and, on the other,  the stupidly monotonous body, perpetually obstructing everything with  its machine-like obstinacy. The more paltry and uniformly repeated  these claims of the body, the more striking will be the result. But  that is only a matter of degree, and the general law of these phenomena  may be formulated as follows: ANY INCIDENT IS COMIC THAT CALLS OUR  ATTENTION TO THE PHYSICAL IN A PERSON WHEN IT IS THE MORAL SIDE THAT IS  CONCERNED.    Why do we laugh at a public speaker who sneezes just at the most  pathetic moment of his speech? Where lies the comic element in this  sentence, taken from a funeral speech and quoted by a German  philosopher: \"He was virtuous and plump\"? It lies in the fact that our  attention is suddenly recalled from the soul to the body. Similar  instances abound in daily life, but if you do not care to take the  trouble to look for them, you have only to open at random a volume of  Labiche, and you will be almost certain to light upon an effect of this  kind. Now, we have a speaker whose most eloquent sentences are cut  short by the twinges of a bad tooth; now, one of the characters who  never begins to speak without stopping in the middle to complain of his  shoes being too small, or his belt too tight, etc. A PERSON EMBARRASSED  BY HIS BODY is the image suggested to us in all these examples. The  reason that excessive stoutness is laughable is probably because it  calls up an image of the same kind. I almost think that this too is  what sometime makes bashfulness somewhat ridiculous. The bashful man  rather gives the impression of a person embarrassed by his body,  looking round for some convenient cloak-room in which to deposit it.    This is just why the tragic poet is so careful to avoid anything  calculated to attract attention to the material side of his heroes. No  sooner does anxiety about the body manifest itself than the intrusion  of a comic element is to be feared. On this account, the hero in a  tragedy does not eat or drink or warm himself. He does not even sit  down any more than can be helped. To sit down in the middle of a fine  speech would imply that you remembered you had a body. Napoleon, who  was a psychologist when he wished to be so, had noticed that the  transition from tragedy to comedy is effected simply by sitting down.  In the \"Journal inedit\" of Baron Gourgaud--when speaking of an  interview with the Queen of Prussia after the battle of Iena--he  expresses himself in the following terms: \"She received me in tragic  fashion like Chimene: Justice! Sire, Justice! Magdeburg! Thus she  continued in a way most embarrassing to me. Finally, to make her change  her style, I requested her to take a seat. This is the best method for  cutting short a tragic scene, for as soon as you are seated it all  becomes comedy.\"    Let us now give a wider scope to this image of THE BODY TAKING  PRECEDENCE OF THE SOUL. We shall obtain something more general--THE  MANNER SEEKING TO OUTDO THE MATTER, THE LETTER AIMING AT OUSTING THE  SPIRIT. Is it not perchance this idea that comedy is trying to suggest  to us when holding up a profession to ridicule? It makes the lawyer,  the magistrate and the doctor speak as though health and justice were  of little moment,--the main point being that we should have lawyers,  magistrates and doctors, and that all outward formalities pertaining to  these professions should be scrupulously respected. And so we find the  means substituted for the end, the manner for the matter; no longer is  it the profession that is made for the public, but rather the public  for the profession. Constant attention to form and the mechanical  application of rules here bring about a kind of professional automatism  analogous to that imposed upon the soul by the habits of the body, and  equally laughable. Numerous are the examples of this on the stage.  Without entering into details of the variations executed on this theme,  let us quote two or three passages in which the theme itself is set  forth in all its simplicity. \"You are only bound to treat people  according to form,\" says Doctor Diafoirus in the \"Malade imaginaire\".  Again, says Doctor Bahis, in \"L'Amour medecin\": \"It is better to die  through following the rules than to recover through violating them.\" In  the same play, Desfonandres had previously said: \"We must always  observe the formalities of professional etiquette, whatever may  happen.\" And the reason is given by Tomes, his colleague: \"A dead man  is but a dead man, but the non-observance of a formality causes a  notable prejudice to the whole faculty.\" Brid'oison's words, though.  embodying a rather different idea, are none the less significant:  \"F-form, mind you, f-form. A man laughs at a judge in a morning coat,  and yet he would quake with dread at the mere sight of an attorney in  his gown. F-form, all a matter of f-form.\"    Here we have the first illustration of a law which will appear with  increasing distinctness as we proceed with our task. When a musician  strikes a note on an instrument, other notes start up of themselves,  not so loud as the first, yet connected with it by certain definite  relations, which coalesce with it and determine its quality. These are  what are called in physics the overtones of the fundamental note. It  would seem that comic fancy, even in its most far-fetched inventions,  obeys a similar law. For instance, consider this comic note: appearance  seeking to triumph over reality. If our analysis is correct, this note  must have as its overtones the body tantalising the mind, the body  taking precedence of the mind. No sooner, then, does the comic poet  strike the first note than he will add the second on to it,  involuntarily and instinctively. In other words, HE WILL DUPLICATE WHAT  IS RIDICULOUS PROFESSIONALLY WITH SOMETHING THAT IS RIDICULOUS  PHYSICALLY.    When Brid'oison the judge comes stammering on to the stage, is he not  actually preparing us, by this very stammering, to understand the  phenomenon of intellectual ossification we are about to witness? What  bond of secret relationship can there be between the physical defect  and the moral infirmity? It is difficult to say; yet we feel that the  relationship is there, though we cannot express it in words. Perhaps  the situation required that this judging machine should also appear  before us as a talking machine. However it may be, no other overtone  could more perfectly have completed the fundamental note.    When Moliere introduces to us the two ridiculous doctors, Bahis and  Macroton, in L'Amour medecin, he makes one of them speak very slowly,  as though scanning his words syllable by syllable, whilst the other  stutters. We find the same contrast between the two lawyers in Monsieur  de Pourceaugnac. In the rhythm of speech is generally to be found the  physical peculiarity that is destined to complete the element of  professional ridicule. When the author has failed to suggest a defect  of this kind, it is seldom the case that the actor does not  instinctively invent one.    Consequently, there is a natural relationship, which we equally  naturally recognise, between the two images we have been comparing with  each other, the mind crystallising in certain grooves, and the body  losing its elasticity through the influence of certain defects. Whether  or not our attention be diverted from the matter to the manner, or from  the moral to the physical, in both cases the same sort of impression is  conveyed to our imagination; in both, then, the comic is of the same  kind. Here, once more, it has been our aim to follow the natural trend  of the movement of the imagination. This trend or direction, it may be  remembered, was the second of those offered to us, starting from a  central image. A third and final path remains unexplored, along which  we will now proceed.    3. Let us then return, for the last time, to our central image:  something mechanical encrusted on something living. Here, the living  being under discussion was a human being, a person. A mechanical  arrangement, on the other hand, is a thing. What, therefore, incited  laughter was the momentary transformation of a person into a thing, if  one considers the image from this standpoint. Let us then pass from the  exact idea of a machine to the vaguer one of a thing in general. We  shall have a fresh series of laughable images which will be obtained by  taking a blurred impression, so to speak, of the outlines of the former  and will bring us to this new law: WE LAUGH EVERY TIME A PERSON GIVES  US THE IMPRESSION OF BEING A THING.    We laugh at Sancho Panza tumbled into a bed-quilt and tossed into the  air like a football. We laugh at Baron Munchausen turned into a  cannon-ball and travelling through space. But certain tricks of circus  clowns might afford a still more precise exemplification of the same  law. True, we should have to eliminate the jokes, mere interpolations  by the clown into his main theme, and keep in mind only the theme  itself, that is to say, the divers attitudes, capers and movements  which form the strictly \"clownish\" element in the clown's art. On two  occasions only have I been able to observe this style of the comic in  its unadulterated state, and in both I received the same impression.  The first time, the clowns came and went, collided, fell and jumped up  again in a uniformly accelerated rhythm, visibly intent upon affecting  a CRESCENDO. And it was more and more to the jumping up again, the  REBOUND, that the attention of the public was attracted. Gradually, one  lost sight of the fact that they were men of flesh and blood like  ourselves; one began to think of bundles of all sorts, falling and  knocking against each other. Then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#7)"],[1,"eating anything but little girls,\"  replied the bear.    \"Very good,\" remarked the clown, drawing a long breath of relief.  \"you may begin eating Jane Gladys as soon as you wish. She laughed  because I had no back.\"    \"And she laughed because my legs are out of perspective,\" brayed the  donkey.    \"But you also deserve to be eaten,\" screamed the leopard from the  back of the leather chair; \"for you laughed and poked fun at me  because I had no claws nor teeth! Don't you suppose Mr. Grizzly, you  could manage to eat a clown, a donkey and a monkey after you finish  the girl?\"    \"Perhaps so, and a leopard into the bargain,\" growled the bear. \"It  will depend on how hungry I am. But I must begin on the little girl  first, because the author says I prefer girls to anything.\"    Jane Gladys was much frightened on hearing this conversation, and  she began to realize what the man meant when he said he gave her the  book to be revenged. Surely papa would be sorry he hadn't bought the  \"Complete Works of Peter Smith\" when he came home and found his  little girl eaten up by a grizzly bear--shoes, dress, ribbons and  all!    The bear stood up and balanced himself on his rear legs.    \"This is the way I look in the book,\" he said. \"Now watch me eat the  little girl.\"    He advanced slowly toward Jane Gladys, and the monkey, the leopard,  the donkey and the clown all stood around in a circle and watched  the bear with much interest.    But before the grizzly reached her the child had a sudden thought,  and cried out:    \"Stop! You mustn't eat me. It would be wrong.\"    \"Why?\" asked the bear, in surprise.    \"Because I own you. You're my private property,\" she answered.    \"I don't see how you make that out,\" said the bear, in a  disappointed tone.    \"Why, the book was given to me; my name's on the front leaf. And you  belong, by rights, in the book. So you mustn't dare to eat your  owner!\"    The Grizzly hesitated.    \"Can any of you read?\" he asked.    \"I can,\" said the clown.    \"Then see if she speaks the truth. Is her name really in the book?\"    The clown picked it up and looked at the name.    \"It is,\" said he. \"'Jane Gladys Brown;' and written quite plainly in  big letters.\"    The bear sighed.    \"Then, of course, I can't eat her,\" he decided. \"That author is as  disappointing as most authors are.\"    \"But he's not as bad as the artist,\" exclaimed the donkey, who was  still trying to stand up straight.    \"The fault lies with yourselves,\" said Jane Gladys, severely. \"Why  didn't you stay in the book, where you were put?\"    The animals looked at each other in a foolish way, and the clown  blushed under his white paint.    \"Really--\" began the bear, and then he stopped short.    The door bell rang loudly.    \"It's mamma!\" cried Jane Gladys, springing to her feet. \"She's come  home at last. Now, you stupid creatures--\"    But she was interrupted by them all making a rush for the book.  There was a swish and a whirr and a rustling of leaves, and an  instant later the book lay upon the floor looking just like any  other book, while Jane Gladys' strange companions had all  disappeared.    * * * * *    This story should teach us to think quickly and clearly upon all  occasions; for had Jane Gladys not remembered that she owned the  bear he probably would have eaten her before the bell rang.          THE ENCHANTED TYPES      One time a knook became tired of his beautiful life and longed for  something new to do. The knooks have more wonderful powers than any  other immortal folk--except, perhaps, the fairies and ryls. So one  would suppose that a knook who might gain anything he desired by a  simple wish could not be otherwise than happy and contented. But  such was not the case with Popopo, the knook we are speaking of. He  had lived thousands of years, and had enjoyed all the wonders he  could think of. Yet life had become as tedious to him now as it  might be to one who was unable to gratify a single wish.    Finally, by chance, Popopo thought of the earth people who dwell in  cities, and so he resolved to visit them and see how they lived.  This would surely be fine amusement, and serve to pass away many  wearisome hours.    Therefore one morning, after a breakfast so dainty that you could  scarcely imagine it, Popopo set out for the earth and at once was in  the midst of a big city.    His own dwelling was so quiet and peaceful that the roaring noise of  the town startled him. His nerves were so shocked that before he had  looked around three minutes he decided to give up the adventure, and  instantly returned home.    This satisfied for a time his desire to visit the earth cities, but  soon the monotony of his existence again made him restless and gave  him another thought. At night the people slept and the cities would  be quiet. He would visit them at night.    So at the proper time Popopo transported himself in a jiffy to a  great city, where he began wandering about the streets. Everyone was  in bed. No wagons rattled along the pavements; no throngs of busy  men shouted and halloaed. Even the policemen slumbered slyly and  there happened to be no prowling thieves abroad.    His nerves being soothed by the stillness, Popopo began to enjoy  himself. He entered many of the houses and examined their rooms with  much curiosity. Locks and bolts made no difference to a knook, and  he saw as well in darkness as in daylight.    After a time he strolled into the business portion of the city.  Stores are unknown among the immortals, who have no need of money or  of barter and exchange; so Popopo was greatly interested by the  novel sight of so many collections of goods and merchandise.    During his wanderings he entered a millinery shop, and was surprised  to see within a large glass case a great number of women's hats,  each bearing in one position or another a stuffed bird. Indeed, some  of the most elaborate hats had two or three birds upon them.    Now knooks are the especial guardians of birds, and love them  dearly. To see so many of his little friends shut up in a glass case  annoyed and grieved Popopo, who had no idea they had purposely been  placed upon the hats by the milliner. So he slid back one of the  doors of the case, gave the little chirruping whistle of the knooks  that all birds know well, and called:    \"Come, friends; the door is open--fly out!\"    Popopo did not know the birds were stuffed; but, stuffed or not,  every bird is bound to obey a knook's whistle and a knook's call. So  they left the hats, flew out of the case and began fluttering about  the room.    \"Poor dears!\" said the kind-hearted knook, \"you long to be in the  fields and forests again.\"    Then he opened the outer door for them and cried: \"Off with you! Fly  away, my beauties, and be happy again.\"    The astonished birds at once obeyed, and when they had soared away  into the night air the knook closed the door and continued his  wandering through the streets.    By dawn he saw many interesting sights, but day broke before he had  finished the city, and he resolved to come the next evening a few  hours earlier.    As soon as it was dark the following day he came again to the city  and on passing the millinery shop noticed a light within. Entering  he found two women, one of whom leaned her head upon the table and  sobbed bitterly, while the other strove to comfort her.    Of course Popopo was invisible to mortal eyes, so he stood by and  listened to their conversation.    \"Cheer up, sister,\" said one. \"Even though your pretty birds have  all been stolen the hats themselves remain.\"    \"Alas!\" cried the other, who was the milliner, \"no one will buy my  hats partly trimmed, for the fashion is to wear birds upon them. And  if I cannot sell my goods I shall be utterly ruined.\"    Then she renewed her sobbing and the knook stole away, feeling a  little ashamed to realized that in his love for the birds he had  unconsciously wronged one of the earth people and made her unhappy.    This thought brought him back to the millinery shop later in the  night, when the two women had gone home. He wanted, in some way, to  replace the birds upon the hats, that the poor woman might be happy  again. So he searched until he came upon a nearby cellar full of  little gray mice, who lived quite undisturbed and gained a  livelihood by gnawing through the walls into neighboring houses and  stealing food from the pantries.    \"Here are just the creatures,\" thought Popopo, \"to place upon the  woman's hats. Their fur is almost as soft as the plumage of the  birds, and it strikes me the mice are remarkably pretty and graceful  animals. Moreover, they now pass their lives in stealing, and were  they obliged to remain always upon women's hats their morals would  be much improved.\"    So he exercised a charm that drew all the mice from the cellar and  placed them upon the hats in the glass case, where they occupied the  places the birds had vacated and looked very becoming--at least, in  the eyes of the unworldly knook. To prevent their running about and  leaving the hats Popopo rendered them motionless, and then he was so  pleased with his work that he decided to remain in the shop and  witness the delight of the milliner when she saw how daintily her  hats were now trimmed.    She came in the early morning, accompanied by her sister, and her  face wore a sad and resigned expression. After sweeping and dusting  the shop and drawing the blinds she opened the glass case and took  out a hat.    But when she saw a tiny gray mouse nestling among the ribbons and  laces she gave a loud shriek, and, dropping the hat, sprang with one  bound to the top of the table. The sister, knowing the shriek to be  one of fear, leaped upon a chair and exclaimed:    \"What is it? Oh! what is it?\"    \"A mouse!\" gasped the milliner, trembling with terror.    Popopo, seeing this commotion, now realized that mice are especially  disagreeable to human beings, and that he had made a"]]]
