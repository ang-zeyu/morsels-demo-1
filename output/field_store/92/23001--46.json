I t'ought after that he was  layin' fer me, but de next time he seen me he put me wise to dis  place.\"    \"Coals of fire,\" said Jimmy. \"He was of a forgiving disposition.\" A  single rain-drop descended on the nape of his neck. In another  moment, a smart shower had begun.    \"This matter has passed out of our hands,\" said Jimmy. \"We must  break in, if only to get shelter. Get busy, my lad.\"    There was a handy window only a few feet from the ground. Spike  pulled from his pocket a small bottle.    \"What's that?\" inquired Jimmy.    \"Molasses, boss,\" said Spike, deferentially.    He poured the contents of the bottle on a piece of paper, which he  pressed firmly against the window-pane. Then, drawing out a short  steel instrument, he gave the paper a sharp tap. The glass broke  almost inaudibly. The paper came away, leaving a gap in the pane.  Spike inserted his hand, shot back the catch, and softly pushed up  the window.    \"Elementary,\" said Jimmy; \"elementary, but quite neat.\"    There was now a shutter to be negotiated. This took longer, but in  the end Spike's persuasive methods prevailed.    Jimmy became quite cordial.    \"You have been well-grounded, Spike,\" he said. \"And, after all, that  is half the battle. The advice I give to every novice is, 'Learn to  walk before you try to run.' Master the a, b, c, of the craft first.  With a little careful coaching, you will do. Just so. Pop in.\"    Spike climbed cautiously over the sill, followed by Jimmy. The  latter struck a match, and found the electric light switch. They  were in a parlor, furnished and decorated with surprising taste.  Jimmy had expected the usual hideousness, but here everything from  the wall-paper to the smallest ornaments was wonderfully well  selected.    Business, however, was business. This was no time to stand admiring  artistic effects in room-furnishing. There was that big J to be  carved on the front door. If 'twere done, then 'twere well 'twere  done quickly.    He was just moving to the door, when from some distant part of the  house came the bark of a dog. Another joined in. The solo became a  duet. The air was filled with their clamor.    \"Gee!\" cried Spike.    The remark seemed more or less to sum up the situation.    \"'Tis sweet,\" says Byron, \"to hear the watch-dog's honest bark.\"  Jimmy and Spike found two watch-dogs' honest barks cloying. Spike  intimated this by making a feverish dash for the open window.  Unfortunately for the success of this maneuver, the floor of the  room was covered not with a carpet but with tastefully scattered  rugs, and underneath these rugs it was very highly polished. Spike,  treading on one of these islands, was instantly undone. No power of  will or muscle can save a man in such a case. Spike skidded. His  feet flew from under him. There was a momentary flash of red head,  as of a passing meteor. The next moment, he had fallen on his back  with a thud that shook the house. Even in the crisis, the thought  flashed across Jimmy's mind that this was not Spike's lucky night.    Upstairs, the efforts of the canine choir had begun to resemble the  \"A che la morte\" duet in \"Il Trovatore.\" Particularly good work was  being done by the baritone dog.    Spike sat up, groaning. Equipped though he was by nature with a  skull of the purest and most solid ivory, the fall had disconcerted  him. His eyes, like those of Shakespeare's poet, rolling in a fine  frenzy, did glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. He  passed his fingers tenderly through his vermilion hair.    Heavy footsteps were descending the stairs. In the distance, the  soprano dog had reached A in alt., and was holding it, while his  fellow artiste executed runs in the lower register.    \"Get up!\" hissed Jimmy. \"There's somebody coming! Get up, you idiot,  can't you!\"    It was characteristic of Jimmy that it never even occurred to him to  desert the fallen one, and depart alone. Spike was his brother-in-arms.  He would as soon have thought of deserting him as a sea-captain  would of abandoning the ship.    Consequently, as Spike, despite all exhortations, continued to  remain on the floor, rubbing his head and uttering \"Gee!\" at  intervals in a melancholy voice, Jimmy resigned himself to fate, and  stood where he was, waiting for the door to open.    It opened the next moment as if a cyclone had been behind it.          CHAPTER VII    GETTING ACQUAINTED      A cyclone, entering a room, is apt to alter the position of things.  This cyclone shifted a footstool, a small chair, a rug, and Spike.  The chair, struck by a massive boot, whirled against the wall. The  foot-stool rolled away. The rug crumpled up and slid. Spike, with a  yell, leaped to his feet, slipped again, fell, and finally  compromised on an all-fours position, in which attitude he remained,  blinking.    While these stirring acts were in progress, there was the sound of a  door opening upstairs, followed by a scuttering of feet and an  appalling increase in the canine contribution to the current noises.  The duet had now taken on quite a Wagnerian effect.    There raced into the room first a white bull-terrier, he of the  soprano voice, and--a bad second--his fellow artiste, the baritone,  a massive bull-dog, bearing a striking resemblance to the big man  with the big lower jaw whose entrance had started the cyclone.    And, then, in theatrical parlance, the entire company \"held the  picture.\" Up-stage, with his hand still on the door, stood the man  with the jaw; downstage, Jimmy; center, Spike and the bull-dog,  their noses a couple of inches apart, inspected each other with  mutual disfavor. On the extreme O. P. side, the bull-terrier, who  had fallen foul of a wicker-work table, was crouching with extended  tongue and rolling eyes, waiting for the next move.    The householder looked at Jimmy. Jimmy looked at the householder.  Spike and the bull-dog looked at each other. The bull-terrier  distributed his gaze impartially around the company.    \"A typical scene of quiet American home-life,\" murmured Jimmy.    The householder glowered.    \"Hands up, you devils!\" he roared, pointing a mammoth revolver.    The two marauders humored his whim.    \"Let me explain,\" said Jimmy pacifically, shuffling warily around in  order to face the bull-terrier, who was now strolling in his  direction with an ill-assumed carelessness.    \"Keep still, you blackguard!\"    Jimmy kept still. The bull-terrier, with the same abstracted air,  was beginning a casual inspection of his right trouser-leg.    Relations between Spike and the bull-dog, meanwhile, had become more  strained. The sudden flinging up of the former's arms had had the  worst effects on the animal's nerves. Spike, the croucher on  all-fours, he might have tolerated; but Spike, the semaphore, inspired  him with thoughts of battle. He was growling in a moody, reflective  manner. His eye was full of purpose.    It was probably this that caused Spike to look at the householder.  Till then, he had been too busy to shift his gaze, but now the  bull-dog's eye had become so unpleasing that he cast a pathetic glance up  at the man by the door.    \"Gee!\" he cried. \"It's de boss. Say, boss, call off de dawg. It's  sure goin' to nip de hull head off'n me.\"    The other lowered the revolver in surprise.    \"So, it's you, you limb of Satan!\" he remarked. \"I thought I had  seen that damned red head of yours before. What are you doing in my  house?\"    Spike uttered a howl in which indignation and self-pity were nicely  blended.    \"I'll lay for that Swede!\" he cried. \"I'll soak it to him good!  Boss, I've had a raw deal. On de level, I has. Dey's a feller I  know, a fat Swede--Ole Larsen his monaker is--an' dis feller an' me  started in scrapping last week, an' I puts it all over him, so he  had it in for me. But he comes up to me, like as if he's meanin' to  be good, an' he says he's got a soft proposition fer me if I'll give  him half. So, I says all right, where is it? An' he gives me de  number of dis house, an' says dis is where a widder-lady lives all  alone, an' has got silver mugs and t'ings to boin, an' dat she's  away down Sout', so dere ain't nobody in de house. Gee! I'll soak it  to dat Swede! It was a raw deal, boss. He was just hopin' to put me  in bad wit' you. Dat's how it was, boss. Honest!\"    The big man listened to this sad story of Grecian gifts in silence.  Not so the bull-dog, which growled from start to finish.    Spike eyed it uneasily.    \"Won't you call off de dawg, boss?\" he said.    The other stooped, and grasped the animal's collar, jerking him  away.    \"The same treatment,\" suggested Jimmy with approval, \"would also do  a world of good to this playful and affectionate animal--unless he  is a vegetarian. In which case, don't bother.\"    The big man glowered at him.    \"Who are you?\" he demanded.    \"My name,\" began Jimmy, \"is--\"    \"Say,\" said Spike, \"he's a champion burglar, boss--\"    The householder shut the door.    \"Eh?\" he said.    \"He's a champion burglar from de odder side. He sure is. From  Lunnon. Gee, he's de guy! Tell him about de bank you opened, an' de  jools you swiped from de duchess, an' de what-d'ye-call-it  blow-pipe.\"    It seemed to Jimmy that Spike was showing a certain want of tact.  When you are discovered by a householder--with revolver--in his  parlor at half-past three in the morning, it is surely an  injudicious move to lay stress on your proficiency as a burglar. The  householder may be supposed to take that for granted. The side of  your character that should be advertised in such a crisis is the  non-burglarious. Allusion should be made to the fact that, as a  child, you attended Sunday school regularly, and to what the  minister said when you took the divinity prize. The idea should be  conveyed to the householder's mind that, if let off with a caution,  your innate goodness of heart will lead you to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#7)"],[1,"AEthelred and Bishop Ealhferth and Bishop AEthelhead and Earl Wulfhere  and Earl Eadwulf and Earl Cuthred and Abbot Tunberht and Milred my  thegn and AEthelwulf and Osric and Brihtulf and Cyma.

Amen.\"            Sons usually succeeded their fathers on the same land as shown  by this lifetime lease: \"Bishop Denewulf and the community at  Winchester lease to Alfred for his lifetime 40 hides of land at  Alresford, in accordance with the lease which Bishop Tunbriht had  granted to his parents and which had run out, on condition that he  renders every year at the autumnal equinox three pounds as rent, and  church dues, and the work connected with church dues; and when the need  arises, his men shall be ready both for harvesting and hunting; and  after his death the property shall pass undisputed to St. Peter's.  These are the signatures of the councilors and of the members of the  community who gave their consent, namely ...\"            Alfred invented a graduated candle with spaces indicating one  hour of burning, which could be used as a clock. He used a ventilated  cow's horn to put around the top of the candle to prevent its blowing  out, and then devised a wooden lantern with a horn window. He described  the world as like a yolk in the middle of an egg whose shell moves  around it. This agreed with the position of Ptolemy Claudius of  Alexandria, who showed the curvature of the earth from north to south  by observing that the Polar Star was higher in the north and lower in  the south. That it was curved from east to west followed from the  observation that two clocks placed one west and one east would record a  different time for the same eclipse of the moon.            Alfred wrote poems on the worthiness of wisdom and knowledge in  preference to material pleasures, pride, and fame, in dealing with  life's sorrow and strife. His observations on human nature and his  proverbs include:    1. As one sows, so will he mow.  2. Every man's doom [judgment] returns to his door.  3. He who will not learn while young, will repent of it when old.  4. Weal [prosperity] without wisdom is worthless.  5. Though a man had 70 acres sown with red gold, and the gold grew like  grass, yet he is not a whit the worthier unless he gain friends for  himself.  6. Gold is but a stone unless a wise man has it.  7. It's hard to row against the sea flood; so it is against misfortune.  8. He who toils in his youth to win wealth, so that he may enjoy ease  in his old age, has well bestowed his toil.  9. Many a man loses his soul through silver.  10. Wealth may pass away, but wisdom will remain, and no man may perish  who has it for his comrade.  11. Don't choose a wife for her beauty nor for wealth, but study her  disposition.  12. Many an apple is bright without and bitter within.  13. Don't believe the man of many words.  14. With a few words a wise man can compass much.  15. Make friends at market, and at church, with poor and with rich.  16. Though one man wielded all the world, and all the joy that dwells  therein, he could not therewith keep his life.  17. Don't chide with a fool.  18. A fool's bolt is soon shot.  19. If you have a child, teach it men's manners while it is little. If  you let him have his own will, he will cause you much sorrow when he  comes of age.  20. He who spares the rod and lets a young child rule, shall rue it  when the child grows old.  21. Either drinking or not drinking is, with wisdom, good.  22. Relatives often quarrel together.  23. The barkless dog bites ill.  24. Be wise of word and wary of speech, then all shall love you.  25. We may outride, but not outwit, the old man.  26. Be not so mad as to tell your friend all your thoughts.  27. If you and your friend fall out, then your enemy will know what  your friend knew before.  28. Don't choose a deceitful man as a friend, for he will do you harm.  29. The false one will betray you when you least expect it.  30. Don't choose a scornful false friend, for he will steal your goods  and deny the theft.  31. Take to yourself a steadfast man who is wise in word and deed; he  will prove a true friend in need.            To restore education and religion, Alfred disseminated the  Anglo- Saxon Chronicles; the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of  the English Nation; the \"Consolidation of Philosophy\" by Roman  philosopher Boethius, which related the use of adversity to develop the  soul, and described the goodness of God and how the highest happiness  comes from spiritual values and the soul, which are eternal, rather  than from material or earthly pursuits, which are temporal; and Pope  Gregory's Pastoral Care, which he had translated into English and was  the fundamental book on the duty of a bishop, which included a duty to  teach laymen; and Orosius' History of the World, which he had  translated into English. Alfred's advice to pastors was to live as they  had been taught from books and to teach this manner of life to others.  To be avoided was pride, the mind's deception of seeking glory in the  name of doing good works, and the corruption of high office. Bede was  England's first scholar, first theologian, and first historian. He  wrote poetry, theological books, homilies, and textbooks on grammar,  rhetoric [public speaking and debating], arithmetic, and astronomy. He  adhered to the doctrine that death entered the world by the sin of  Adam, the first man. He began the practice of dating years from the  birth of Christ and believed that the earth was round. Over the earth  was a fiery spherical firmament. Above this were the waters of the  heavens. Above this were the upper heavens, which contained the angels  and was tempered with ice. He declared that comets portend downfalls of  kingdoms, pestilence, war, winds, or heat. This reflected the church's  view that a comet was a ball of fire flung from the right hand of an  angry God as a warning to mankind, usually for disbelief. Storms were  begun by the devil.            A famous poem, the oral legend of Beowulf, a hero who led his  men into adventures and performed great feats and fought monsters and  dragons, was put into writing with a Christian theme. In it, loyalty to  one's lord is a paramount virtue. Also available in writing was the  story of King Arthur's twelve victorious battles against the pagan  Saxons, authored by Nennius.            There were professional story tellers attached to great men.  Others wandered from court to court, receiving gifts for their story  telling. Men usually told oral legends of their own feats and those of  their ancestors after supper.            Alfred had monasteries rebuilt with learned and moral men  heading them. He built a nunnery which was headed by his daughter as  prioress. He built a strong wall with four gates around London, which  he had taken into his control. He appointed his son-in-law, who was one  of his eorldormen, to be alderman [older man] to govern London and to  be the shire's earl. A later king built a palace in London, although  Winchester was still the royal capital town. When the king traveled, he  and his retinue were fed by the local people at their expense.            After Alfred's death, his daughter Aethelflared ruled the  country for seven years. She had more fortified burhs built and led  soldiers to victories.            Burhs grew into towns and some towns into boroughs by obtaining  a charter from the king. Their citizens were landholding freemen  called.\"burgesses\". A borough typically was a place of refuge with  earth works, and perhaps a garrrison; it had a market place in which  men could buy cattle and other goods and have the sale attested by  official witnesses and toll was taken from them; and it had a meeting  place at which a court was held.            Under the royalty were the nobles. An earl headed each shire as  representative of the King. The term \"earl\" came to denote an office  instead of a nobleman. He led the array of his shire to do battle if  the shire was attacked. He executed all royal commands. An earl  received grants of land and could claim hospitality and maintenance for  himself, his officers, and his servants. He collected a third of the  revenues derived from tolls and duties levied in the boroughs of his  shire. The office tended to be hereditary. Royal representatives called  \"reeves\" started to assist them. The reeve took security from every  person for the maintenance of the public peace. He also tracked cattle  thieves, brought suspects to court, gave judgments according to the  doom books, and delivered offenders to punishment.            Under the earls were the thegns. By service to the King, it was  possible for a coerl to rise to become a thegn and to be given land by  the King. Other thegns performed functions of magistrates. A thegn was  later identified as a person with five hides of land, a kitchen, a  church, a bell house, a judicial place at the burhgemote [a right of  magistracy], and an appointment in the King's hall. He was bound to  service in war by virtue of his landholding instead of by his  relationship to the king. Nobility was now a territorial attribute,  rather than one of birth. The wergeld of a thegn was 1200s. when that  of a ceorl or ordinary freeman was 200s. The wergeld of an earl or  bishop was four times that of a thegn: 5800s. The wergeld of a king or  archbishop was six times that of a thegn: 7200s. The higher a man's  wergeld, the higher was his legal status in the scale of punishment,  giving credible evidence, and participation in legal proceedings. The  sokemen were freemen who had inherited their own land, chose their own  lord, and attended and were subject to their lord's court. That is,  their lord has sake [sac] and soke [soc] jurisdiction over them - the  right to hold a court and to receive the profits of"]]]
