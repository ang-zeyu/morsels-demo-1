We have a rare store of shafts ready,  and they will find that their cross-bowmen are of little use against  picked English archers, even though there be but twenty-five of us in  all.\"    \"You know very well, Long Tom, that you would have come over here whether  there was any chance of your drawing your bow on a Frenchman or not.\"    \"That is true enough, Master Guy. Our lady wanted some bowmen, and I, who  have been born and bred on the estate, was of course bound to go with her.  Then you see, Master Guy, haven't I taught you to use the bow and the  quarter-staff, and carried you on my shoulder many a score of times when  you were a little lad and I was a big boy? It would not have been natural  for you to have gone out with a chance of getting into a fight without my  being there to draw a shaft when you needed it. Why, Ruth Gregory, whose  sworn bachelor you know I am, would have cried shame on me if I had  lingered behind. I told her that if I stayed it would be for her sake, and  you should have seen how she flouted me, saying that she would have no  tall lout hiding behind her petticoats, and that if I stayed, it should  not be as her man. And now I must be off to my supper, or I shall find  that there is not a morsel left for me.\"    The gates of the castle were closed that night, but it was not considered  necessary to lower the drawbridge. Two sentries were posted at the work  beyond the moat, and one above the gate, besides the watcher at the top of  the keep. The next day things were got into better order. More barricades  were erected for the separation of the cattle; a portion was set aside for  horses. The provisions brought in from the farms were stored away in the  magazines. The women and children began to settle down more comfortably in  their sheds. The best of the horses and cattle were removed into the inner  court-yard. The boys were set drawing water and filling the troughs, while  some of the farm men were told off to carry the fodder to the animals,  most of which, however, were for the time turned out to graze near the  castle. Many of the men who had come in had returned to their work on the  farms. During the day waggons continued to arrive with stores of grain and  forage; boys and girls drove in flocks of geese and turkeys and large  numbers of ducks and hens, until the yard in which the sheds were was  crowded with them. By nightfall every preparation was complete, and even  Jean Bouvard himself could find nothing further to suggest.    \"If they are coming,\" he said to Sir Eustace, \"the sooner they come the  better, my lord; we have done all that we can do, and had best get it over  without more ado.\"    \"I still hope that no one will come, Bouvard, but I agree with you, that  if it is to come the sooner the better. But there is no saying, it may be  to-morrow, it may be months before we are disturbed. Still, in a war like  this, it is likely that all will try and get as much as they can as  quickly as possible, for at any moment it may suit Burgundy and Orleans to  patch up their quarrel again. Burgundy is astute and cunning, and if he  sees that the Orleans princes with Armagnac and the Duke of Bourbon are  likely to get the best of it, he will use the king and queen to intervene  and stop the fighting. Seeing that this may be so, the rogues who have  their eye on their neighbours' goods and possessions will, you may be  sure, lose no time in stretching out their hands for them.\"    A week later came the news that Sir Clugnet de Brabant, who styled himself  Admiral of France, had gathered two thousand men from the Orleanist  garrisons and, with scaling-ladders and other warlike machines, had  attacked the town of Rethel. The inhabitants had, however, notice of their  coming, and resisted so stoutly that the Orleanists had been forced to  retreat, and had then divided into two parties, each of whom had scoured  the country, making prisoners all whom they met, firing the villages and  driving off the cattle, and then returned to the town of Ham and to the  various garrisons from which they had been drawn. Some of the tenants had  returned to their farms, but when the news spread they again took refuge  in the castle. It was probable that Artois, where almost all the towns  were held by the Burgundian party, would be the next object of attack. The  Orleanists remained quiet for eight days only, then the news came that  they had moved out again from Ham eight thousand strong, and were marching  west.    Two days later several fugitives from the country round arrived at the  castle with news that the Orleanists were advancing against Bapaume, and  the next morning they heard that they had, after a fierce fight, won their  way to the gate of the town. The Burgundian garrison had then sallied out  and at first met with success, but had been obliged to retreat within the  walls again. The Orleanists, however, considering the place too strong to  be captured without a long siege, which might be interrupted by a  Burgundian force from Flanders, had drawn off from the place, but were  still marching north burning and plundering.    \"It is likely enough that they will come this way,\" Sir Eustace said as he  and Jean Bouvard talked the matter over. \"Assuredly Arras will be too  strong for them to attempt. The straight line would take them to St. Pol,  but the castle there is a very strong one also. They may sack and burn  Avesne and Auvigni, and then, avoiding both St. Pol and Arras, march  between them to Pernes, which is large enough to give them much plunder,  but has no force that could resist them. As Pernes is but four miles away,  their next call may be here.\"    \"But why should they attack us, Sir Eustace? for here, too, they might  reckon upon more hard blows than plunder.\"    \"It will depend upon whom they have with them,\" Sir Eustace replied. \"They  say that our neighbour Hugh de Fruges went south ten days ago to join the  Duke of Bourbon; his castle is but a small place, and as most of Artois is  Burgundian he might be afraid he might be captured. He has never borne me  good-will, and might well persuade the duke that were my castle and  estates in his possession he might do good service to the cause; and that,  moreover, standing as we do within twelve miles of the English frontier,  its possession might be very valuable to him should the Orleanists ever  have occasion to call in the aid of England, or to oppose their advance  should the Burgundians take that step.\"    \"Surely neither of these factions will do that, Sir Eustace.\"    \"Why not, Bouvard? Every time that English armies have passed into France  they have done it at the invitation of French nobles who have embroiled  themselves with their kings. Burgundy and Orleans, Bourbon and Brittany,  each fights for his own hand, and cares little for France as a whole. They  may be vassals of the Valois, but they regard themselves as being nearly,  if not altogether, their equals, and are always ready to league themselves  with each other, or if it needs be with the English, against the throne.\"    At nine o'clock on the following evening Sir Eustace and his family were  startled by the report of the gun on the keep, and, running out, saw the  signal-fire beginning to blaze up.    \"Above there!\" Sir Eustace shouted, \"where is the alarm?\"    \"A fire has just blazed up on the road to St. Pol,\" the warder replied.    \"Blow your horn, then, loudly and urgently.\"    The news that the Orleanists were marching north from Bapaume had caused  the greater portion of the farmers to come in on the previous day, and in  a short time those who were nearest to the castle, and who had  consequently delayed as long as possible, began to arrive. The garrison  were already under arms, and had taken the places assigned to them on the  walls. All the tenants had brought their arms in with them, and were now  drawn up in the court-yard, where a large bonfire, that had been for some  days in readiness, was now blazing. The new-comers, after turning their  horses into the inclosure with those already there, joined them. All had  been acquainted with the share they were to bear should the place be  besieged. They were to be divided into two parties, one of which was to be  on duty on the walls with the garrison, the other to be held in reserve,  and was--every six hours when matters were quiet--to relieve the party on  the walls, or, when an attack took place, to be under arms and ready to  hasten to any spot where its aid was required. The men were now inspected  by Sir Eustace, additional arms were served out from the armoury to those  whose equipment was insufficient, and they were then dismissed to join  their wives and families until called to the walls.    [Illustration: \"THE TWO MEN WHO LIT THE ALARM FIRES RODE INTO THE  CASTLE.\"]          CHAPTER III -- A SIEGE      The two men who had lit the alarm fires had already ridden in. They  reported that they had, just as it became dark, seen flames rising from a  village three miles from them, and that the man in advance had ridden  forward until near enough to see that a great body of men were issuing  from the village in the direction of the castle.    Ten of the English men-at-arms, and as many French, were now posted in the  outwork at the head of the drawbridge under the command of Jean Bouvard.  Sir Eustace placed himself with his squire on the wall above the gate, and  four men were stationed at the chains of the drawbridge in readiness to  hoist it should the order be given. The English archers were on the wall  beside Sir Eustace, as their arrows commanded the ground beyond the  outwork. Half an hour after the first alarm was given the tale of the  tenants "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#7)"],[1," a fool--a man generally does in a  fix like that. I felt like one, anyway. I got up and walked away, and  it hurt me so much that I went over to West Bourke and went to the dogs  properly for a fortnight, and lost twenty quid on a game of draughts  against a blindfold player. Now both those women had umbrellas, but  I'm not sure to this day which of 'em it was that gave me the poke.  It wouldn't have mattered much anyway. I haven't borrowed one of Bret  Harte's books since.\"    Jake reflected a while. \"The worst of it was,\" he said ruefully, \"that  I wasn't sure that the girl or the woman didn't see through me, and  that worried me a bit. You never can tell how much a woman suspects, and  that's the worst of 'em. I found that out after I got married.\"    The Pretty Girl in the Army grew pale and thin and bigger-eyed. The  women said it was a shame, and that she ought to be sent home to her  friends, wherever they were. She was laid up for two or three days, and  some of the women cooked delicacies and handed 'em over the barracks  fence, and offered to come in and nurse her; but the square woman took  washing home and nursed the girl herself.    The Pretty Girl still sold _War Crys_ and took up collections, but in a  tired, listless, half shamed-faced way. It was plain that she was tired  of the Army, and growing ashamed of the Salvationists. Perhaps she had  come to see things too plainly.    You see, the Army does no good out back in Australia--except from a  business point of view. It is simply there to collect funds for hungry  headquarters. The bushmen are much too intelligent for the Army. There  was no poverty in Bourke--as it is understood in the city; there was  plenty of food; and camping out and roughing it come natural to the  bushmen. In cases of sickness, accident, widows or orphans, the chaps  sent round the hat, without banging a drum or testifying, and that was  all right. If a chap was hard up he borrowed a couple of quid from his  mate. If a strange family arrived without a penny, someone had to fix  'em up, and the storekeepers helped them till the man got work. For the  rest, we work out our own salvation, or damnation--as the case is--in  the bush, with no one to help us, except a mate, perhaps. The Army can't  help us, but a fellow-sinner can, sometimes, who has been through it all  himself. The Army is only a drag on the progress of Democracy, because  it attracts many who would otherwise be aggressive Democrats--and for  other reasons.    Besides, if we all reformed the Army would get deuced little from us for  its city mission.    The Pretty Girl went to service for a while with the stock inspector's  wife, who could get nothing out of her concerning herself or her  friends. She still slept at the barracks, stuck to the Army, and  attended its meetings.      It was Christmas morning, and there was peace in Bourke and goodwill  towards all men. There hadn't been a fight since yesterday evening, and  that had only been a friendly one, to settle an argument concerning  the past ownership, and, at the same time, to decide as to the future  possession of a dog.    It had been a hot, close night, and it ended in a suffocating sunrise.  The free portion of the male population were in the habit of taking  their blankets and sleeping out in \"the Park,\" or town square, in hot  weather; the wives and daughters of the town slept, or tried to sleep,  with bedroom windows and doors open, while husbands lay outside on the  verandas. I camped in a corner of the park that night, and the sun woke  me.    As I sat up I caught sight of a swagman coming along the white, dusty  road from the direction of the bridge, where the cleared road ran across  west and on, a hundred and thirty miles, through the barren, broiling  mulga scrubs, to Hungerford, on the border of Sheol. I knew that  swagman's walk. It was John Merrick (Jack Moonlight), one-time  Shearers' Union secretary at Coonamble, and generally \"Rep\" (shearers'  representative) in any shed where he sheared. He was a \"better-class  shearer,\" one of those quiet, thoughtful men of whom there are generally  two or three in the roughest of rough sheds, who have great influence,  and give the shed a good name from a Union point of view. Not quiet with  the resentful or snobbish reserve of the educated Englishman, but with a  sad or subdued sort of quietness that has force in it--as if they fully  realized that their intelligence is much higher than the average, that  they have suffered more real trouble and heartbreak than the majority of  their mates, and that their mates couldn't possibly understand them if  they spoke as they felt and couldn't see things as they do--yet men  who understand and are intensely sympathetic in their loneliness and  sensitive reserve.    I had worked in a shed with Jack Moonlight, and had met him in  Sydney, and to be mates with a bushman for a few weeks is to know him  well--anyway, I found it so. He had taken a trip to Sydney the Christmas  before last, and when he came back there was something wanting. He  became more silent, he drank more, and sometimes alone, and took to  smoking heavily. He dropped his mates, took little or no interest in  Union matters, and travelled alone, and at night.    The Australian bushman is born with a mate who sticks to him through  life--like a mole. They may be hundreds of miles apart sometimes, and  separated for years, yet they are mates for life. A bushman may have  many mates in his roving, but there is always one his mate, \"my mate;\"  and it is common to hear a bushman, who is, in every way, a true mate  to the man he happens to be travelling with, speak of _his mate's  mate_--\"Jack's mate\"--who might be in Klondyke or South Africa. A  bushman has always a mate to comfort him and argue with him, and work  and tramp and drink with him, and lend him quids when he's hard up, and  call him a b---- fool, and fight him sometimes; to abuse him to his face  and defend his name behind his back; to bear false witness and perjure  his soul for his sake; to lie to the girl for him if he's single, and to  his wife if he's married; to secure a \"pen\" for him at a shed where  he isn't on the spot, or, if the mate is away in New Zealand or South  Africa, to write and tell him if it's any good coming over this way. And  each would take the word of the other against all the world, and each  believes that the other is the straightest chap that ever lived-\"a white  man!\" And next best to your old mate is the man you're tramping, riding,  working, or drinking with.    About the first thing the cook asks you when you come along to a  shearers' hut is, \"Where's your mate?\" I travelled alone for a while  one time, and it seemed to me sometimes, by the tone of the inquiry  concerning the whereabouts of my mate, that the bush had an idea that  I might have done away with him and that the thing ought to be looked  into.    When a man drops mateship altogether and takes to \"hatting\" in the bush,  it's a step towards a convenient tree and a couple of saddle-straps  buckled together.    I had an idea that I, in a measure, took the place of Jack Moonlight's  mate about this time.    \"'Ullo, Jack!\" I hailed as he reached the corner of the park.    \"Good morning, Harry!\" said Jack, as if he'd seen me last yesterday  evening instead of three months ago. \"How are you getting on?\"    We walked together towards the Union Office, where I had a camp in the  skillion-room at the back. Jack was silent. But there's no place in  the world where a man's silence is respected so much (within reasonable  bounds) as in the Australian bush, where every man has a past more or  less sad, and every man a ghost--perhaps from other lands that we know  nothing of, and speaking in a foreign tongue. They say in the bush, \"Oh,  Jack's only thinking!\" And they let him think. Generally you want to  think as much as your mate; and when you've been together some time  it's quite natural to travel all day without exchanging a word. In  the morning Jim says, \"Well, I think I made a bargain with that horse,  Bill,\" and some time late in the afternoon, say twenty miles farther on,  it occurs to Bill to \"rejoin,\" \"Well, I reckon the blank as sold it to  you had yer proper!\"    I like a good thinking mate, and I believe that thinking in company is  a lot more healthy and more comfortable, as well as less risky, than  thinking alone.    On the way to the Union Office Jack and I passed the Royal Hotel, and  caught a glimpse, through the open door, of a bedroom off the veranda,  of the landlord's fresh, fair, young Sydney girl-wife, sleeping prettily  behind the mosquito-net, like a sleeping beauty, while the boss lay on  a mattress outside on the veranda, across the open door. (He wasn't  necessary for publication, but an evidence of good faith.)    I glanced at Jack for a grin, but didn't get one. He wore the pained  expression of a man who is suddenly hit hard with the thought of  something that might have been.    I boiled the billy and fried a pound of steak.    \"Been travelling all night, Tack?\" I asked.    \"Yes,\" said Jack. \"I camped at Emus yesterday.\"    He didn't eat. I began to reckon that he was brooding too much for  his health. He was much thinner than when I saw him last, and pretty  haggard, and he had something of the hopeless, haggard look that I'd  seen in Tom Hall's eyes after the last big shearing strike, when Tom had  worked day and night to hold his mates up all through the hard, bitter  struggle, and the battle was lost.    \"Look here, Jack!\" I said at last. \"What's up?\"    \"Nothing's up, Harry,\" said Jack. \"What made you think so?\"    \"Have you got yourself into any fix?\" I asked. \"What's the Hungerford  track been doing to you?\"    \"No, Harry,\" he said, \"I'm all right. How are you?\" And he pulled some  string and papers and a roll of dusty pound notes from his pocket and  threw them on the bunk.    I was hard up just then, so I "]]]
