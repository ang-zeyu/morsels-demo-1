The cubs scrambled up a tall poplar,  then the mother followed. Sousi came shouting in apparent fear;  I  rushed to the place, thinking he was attacked by something, perhaps  a Buffalo bull, but too late to stop the tragedy that followed.    That night he roasted one of the cubs, and as I watched the old  cannibal chewing the hands off that little baby Bear it gave me a  feeling of disgust for all flesh-eating that lasted for days. Major  Jarvis felt much as I did, and old Sousi had exclusive joy in all  his bear meat.        Next morning I was left at camp while Jarvis and Sousi went off to  seek for more Buffalo. I had a presentiment that they would find  none, so kept the camera and went off to the Lake a mile west, and  there made drawings of some tracks, took photos, etc., and on the  lake saw about twenty-five pairs of ducks, identified Whitewinged  Scoter, Pintail, Green-winged Teal, and Loon. I also watched the  manoeuvres of a courting Peetweet. He approached the only lady with  his feathers up and his wings raised; she paid no heed (apparently),  but I noticed that when he flew away she followed. I saw a large  garter snake striped black and green, and with 2 rows of red  spots, one on each side. It was very fat and sluggish. I took it  for a female about to lay. Later I learned from Sousi and others  that this snake is quite common here, and the only kind found,  but in the mountains that lie not far away in the west is another  kind, much thicker, fatter, and more sluggish. Its bite is fearfully  poisonous, often fatal; \"but the Good God has marked the beast by  putting a cloche (bell) in its tail.\"    About 10 I turned campward, but after tramping for nearly an  hour I was not only not at home, I was in a totally strange kind  of country, covered with a continuous poplar woods. I changed my  course and tried a different direction, but soon was forced to the  conclusion that (for the sixth or seventh time in my life) I was  lost.    \"Dear me,\" I said, \"this is an interesting opportunity. It comes  to me now that I once wrote an essay on 'What To Do and What Not  To Do When Lost In the Woods.' Now what in the world did I say in  it, and which were the things not to do. Yes, I remember now, these  were the pieces of advice:    \"1st. 'Don't get frightened.' Well, I'm not; I am simply amused.    \"2d. 'Wait for your friends to come.' Can't do that; I'm too busy;  they wouldn't appear till night.    \"3d. 'If you must travel, go back to a place where you were sure  of the way.' That means back to the lake, which I know is due west  of the camp and must be west of me now.\"    So back I went, carefully watching the sun for guidance, and soon  realised that whenever I did not, I swung to the left. After nearly  an hour's diligent travel I did get back to the lake, and followed  my own track in the margin to the point of leaving it; then, with  a careful corrected bearing, made for camp and arrived in 40 minutes,  there to learn that on the first attempt I had swung so far to the  left that I had missed camp by half a mile, and was half a mile  beyond it before I knew I was wrong. (See map on p. 46.)    At noon Jarvis and Sousi came back jubilant; they had seen countless  Buffalo trails, had followed a large bull and cow, but had left  them to take the trail of a considerable Band; these they discovered  in a lake. There were 4 big bulls, 4 little calves, 1 yearling, 3  2-year-olds, 8 cows. These allowed them to come openly within 60  yards. Then took alarm and galloped off. They also saw a Moose and  a Marten--and 2 Buffalo skeletons. How I did curse my presentiment  that prevented them having the camera and securing a really fine  photograph!    At 2 P. M. Sousi prepared to break camp. He thought that by going  back on our trail he might strike the trail of another herd off  to the south-east of the mountain. Jarvis shrewdly suspected that  our guide wanted to go home, having kept his promise, won the  reward, and got a load of Bear meat. However, the native was the  guide, we set out in a shower which continued more or less all day  and into the night, so we camped in the rain.    Next day it was obvious, and Sousi no longer concealed the fact,  that he was making for home as fast as he could go.    At Salt River I found the little Teal back on her eggs in the  burnt ground. At 3.30 we reached Smith Landing, having been absent  exactly 3 days, and having seen in that time 33 Buffalo, 4 of them  calves of this year, 3 old Buffalo skeletons of ancient date, but  not a track or sign of a Wolf, not a howl by night, or any evidence  of their recent presence, for the buffalo skeletons found were  obviously very old.    And our guide--the wicked one of evil ancestry and fame--he was  kind, cheerful, and courteous through out; he did exactly as he  promised, did it on time, and was well pleased with the pay we gave  him. Speak as you find. If ever I revisit that country I shall be  glad indeed to secure the services of good old Sousi, even if he  is a Beaulieu.          CHAPTER VIII    THOMAS ANDERSON        We were now back at Smith Landing, and fired with a desire to make  another Buffalo expedition on which we should have ampler time and  cover more than a mere corner of the range. We aimed, indeed, to  strike straight into the heart of the Buffalo country. The same  trouble about guides arose. In this case it was less acute, because  Sousi's account had inspired considerably more respect. Still it  meant days of delay which, however, I aimed to make profitable by  investigations near at hand.    After all, the most interesting of creatures is the two-legged one  with the loose and changeable skin, and there was a goodly colony  of the kind to choose from. Most prominent of them all was Thomas  Anderson, the genial Hudson's Bay Company officer in charge of  the Mackenzie River District. His headquarters are at Fort Smith,  16 miles down the river, but his present abode was Smith Landing,  where all goods are landed for overland transport to avoid the long  and dangerous navigation on the next 16 miles of the broad stream.  Like most of his official brethren, he is a Scotchman; he was born  in Nairn, Scotland, in 1848. At 19 he came to the north-west in  service of the company, and his long and adventurous life, as he  climbed to his present responsible position, may be thus skeletonised:      He spent six months at Fort Temiscamingue,  1 year at Grand Lac,  3 years at Kakabonga,  5 years at Hunter's Lodge, Chippeway,  10 years at Abitibi,  3 years at Dunvegan, Peace River,  1 year at Lesser Slave Lake,  2 months at Savanne, Fort William,  10 years at Nipigon House,  3 years at Isle a la Crosse,  4 years on the Mackenzie River, chiefly at Fort Simpson,  6 months at Fort Smith.      Which tells little to the ears of the big world, but if we say that  he spent 5 years in Berlin, then was moved for 3 years to Gibraltar,  2 years to various posts on the Rhine, whence he went for 4 years  to St. Petersburg; thence to relieve the officer in charge of  Constantinople, and made several flying visits to Bombay and Pekin,  we shall have some idea of his travels, for all were afoot, on  dogsled, or by canoe.    What wonderful opportunities he had to learn new facts about the  wood folk--man and beast--and how little he knew the value of the  glimpses that he got! I made it my business to gather all I could  of his memories, so far as they dwelt with the things of my world,  and offer now a resume of his more interesting observations on  hunter and hunted of the North. [Since these notes were made, Thomas  Anderson has \"crossed the long portage.\"]    The following are among the interesting animal notes:    Cougar. Ogushen, the Indian trapper at Lac des Quinze, found tracks  of a large cat at that place in the fall of 1879 (?). He saw them  all winter on South Bay of that Lake. One day he came on the place  where it had killed a Caribou. When he came back about March he saw  it. It came toward him. It was evidently a cat longer than a Lynx  and it had a very long tail, which swayed from side to side as  it walked. He shot it dead, but feared to go near it believing it  to be a Wendigo. It had a very bad smell. Anderson took it to be  a Puma. It was unknown to the Indian. Ogushen was a first-class  hunter and Anderson firmly believes he was telling the truth. Lac  des Quinze is 15 miles north of Lake Temiscamingue.    Seals. In old days, he says, small seals were found in Lake Ashkeek.  This is 50 miles north-east from Temiscamingue. It empties into  Kippewa River, which empties into Temiscamingue. He never saw one,  but the Indians of the vicinity told of it as a thing which commonly  happened 50 or 60 years ago. Ashkeek is Ojibwa for seal. It is  supposed that they wintered in the open water about the Rapids.    White Foxes, he says, were often taken at Cree Lake. Indeed one or  two were captured each year. Cree Lake is 190 miles south-east of  Fort Chipewyan. They are also taken at Fort Chipewyan from time to  time. One was taken at Fondulac, east end of Lake Athabaska, and  was traded at Smith Landing in 1906. They are found regularly at  Fondulac, the east end of Great Slave Lake, each year.    In the winter of 1885-6 he was to be in charge of Nipigon House,  but got orders beforehand to visit the posts on Albany River. He  set out from Fort William on Lake Superior on his 1,200-mile trip  through the snow with an Indian whose name was Joe Eskimo, from  Manitoulin Island, 400 miles away. At Nipigon House he got another  guide, but this one was in bad shape, spitting blood. After three  days' travel the guide said: \"I will go to the end if it kills me,  because I have promised, unless I can get you a better guide. At  Wayabimika (Lake Savanne) is an old man named Omeegi; he knows the  road better than I do.\" When they got there, Omeegi, although very  old and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#7)"],[1," so I looked through  some books by Rudyard Kipling, and found that Chela meant 'Disciple.'  What you have told me just now about 'Guru' being 'teacher,' seems to  piece the whole thing together.\"    \"And what did Daisy do?\" asked Mrs Lucas breathlessly.    \"She sat down too, and put her legs out straight in front of her like  the Guru, and tried to hold the toe of her shoe in her fingers, and  naturally she couldn't get within yards of it. I got nearer than she  did. And he said, 'Beloved lady, not too far at first.'\"    \"So you could hear too,\" said Lucia.    \"Naturally, for my window was open, and as you know Mrs Quantock's  pear-tree is quite close to the house. And then he told her to stop up  one nostril with her finger and inhale through the other, and then hold  her breath, while he counted six. Then she breathed it all out again,  and started with the other side. She repeated that several times and he  was very much pleased with her. Then she said, 'It is quite wonderful;  I feel so light and vigorous.'\"    \"It would be very wonderful indeed if dear Daisy felt light,\" remarked  Lucia. \"What next?\"    \"Then they sat and swayed backwards and forwards again and muttered  something that sounded like Pom!\"    \"That would be 'Om', and then?\"    \"I couldn't wait any longer for I had some letters to write.\"    She smiled at him.    \"I shall give you another cup of tea to reward you for your report,\"  she said. \"It has all been most interesting. Tell me again about the  breathing in and holding your breath.\"    Georgie did so, and illustrated in his own person what had happened.  Next moment Lucia was imitating him, and Peppino came round in order to  get a better view of what Georgie was doing. Then they all sat,  inhaling through one nostril, holding their breath, and then expelling  it again.    \"Very interesting,\" said Lucia at the end. \"Upon my word, it does give  one a sort of feeling of vigour and lightness. I wonder if there is  something in it.\"          Chapter THREE      Though \"The Hurst\" was, as befitted its Chatelaine, the most  Elizabethanly complete abode in Riseholme, the rest of the village in  its due degree, fell very little short of perfection. It had but its  one street some half mile in length but that street was a gem of  mediaeval domestic architecture. For the most part the houses that  lined it were blocks of contiguous cottages, which had been converted  either singly or by twos and threes into dwellings containing the  comforts demanded by the twentieth century, but externally they  preserved the antiquity which, though it might be restored or  supplemented by bathrooms or other conveniences, presented a truly  Elizabethan appearance. There were, of course, accretions such as old  inn signs above front-doors and old bell-pulls at their sides, but the  doors were uniformly of inconveniently low stature, roofs were of stone  slabs or old brick, in which a suspiciously abundant crop of  antirrhinums and stone crops had anchored themselves, and there was  hardly a garden that did not contain a path of old paving-stones, a  mulberry-tree and some yews cut into shape.    Nothing in the place was more blatantly mediaeval than the village  green, across which Georgie took his tripping steps after leaving the  presence of his queen. Round it stood a row of great elms, and in its  centre was the ducking-pond, according to Riseholme tradition, though  perhaps in less classical villages it might have passed merely for a  duck-pond. But in Riseholme it would have been rank heresy to dream,  even in the most pessimistic moments, of its being anything but a  ducking-pond. Close by it stood a pair of stocks, about which there was  no doubt whatever, for Mr Lucas had purchased them from a neighbouring  iconoclastic village, where they were going to be broken up, and, after  having them repaired, had presented them to the village-green, and  chosen their site close to the ducking pond. Round the green were  grouped the shops of the village, slightly apart from the residential  street, and at the far end of it was that undoubtedly Elizabethan  hostelry, the Ambermere Arms, full to overflowing of ancient tables and  bible-boxes, and fire-dogs and fire-backs, and bottles and chests and  settles. These were purchased in large quantities by the American  tourists who swarmed there during the summer months, at a high profit  to the nimble proprietor, who thereupon purchased fresh antiquities to  take their places. The Ambermere Arms in fact was the antique furniture  shop of the place, and did a thriving trade, for it was much more  interesting to buy objects out of a real old Elizabethan inn, than out  of a shop.    Georgie had put his smart military cape over his arm for his walk, and  at intervals applied his slim forefinger to one nostril, while he  breathed in through the other, continuing the practice which he had  observed going on in Mrs Quantock's garden. Though it made him a little  dizzy, it certainly produced a sort of lightness, but soon he  remembered the letter from Mrs Quantock which Lucia had read out,  warning her that these exercises ought to be taken under instruction,  and so desisted. He was going to deliver Lucia's answer at Mrs  Quantock's house, and with a view to possibly meeting the Guru, and  being introduced to him, he said over to himself \"Guru, Guru, Guru\"  instead of doing deep breathing, in order to accustom himself to the  unusual syllables.    It would, of course, have been very strange and un-Riseholme-like to  have gone to a friend's door, even though the errand was so impersonal  a one as bearing somebody else's note, without enquiring whether the  friend was in, and being instantly admitted if she was, and as a matter  of fact, Georgie caught a glimpse, when the knocker was answered (Mrs  Quantock did not have a bell at all), through the open door of the  hall, of Mrs Quantock standing in the middle of the lawn on one leg.  Naturally, therefore, he ran out into the garden without any further  formality. She looked like a little round fat stork, whose legs had not  grown, but who preserved the habits of her kind.    \"Dear lady, I've brought a note for you,\" he said, \"it's from Lucia.\"    The other leg went down, and she turned on him the wide firm smile that  she had learned in the vanished days of Christian Science.    \"Om,\" said Mrs Quantock, expelling the remainder of her breath. \"Thank  you, my dear Georgie. It's extraordinary what Yoga has done for me  already. Cold quite gone. If ever you feel out of sorts, or depressed  or cross you can cure yourself at once. I've got a visitor staying with  me.\"    \"Have you indeed?\" asked Georgie, without alluding to the thrilling  excitements which had trodden so close on each other's heels since  yesterday morning when he had seen the Guru in Rush's shop.    \"Yes; and as you've just come from dear Lucia's perhaps she may have  said something to you about him, for I wrote to her about him. He's a  Guru of extraordinary sanctity from Benares, and he's teaching me the  Way. You shall see him too, unless he's meditating. I will call to him;  if he's meditating he won't hear me, so we shan't be interrupting him.  He wouldn't hear a railway accident if he was meditating.\"    She turned round towards the house.    \"Guru, dear!\" she called.    There was a moment's pause, and the Indian's face appeared at a window.    \"Beloved lady!\" he said.    \"Guru dear, I want to introduce a friend of mine to you,\" she said.  \"This is Mr Pillson, and when you know him a little better you will  call him Georgie.\"    \"Beloved lady, I know him very well indeed. I see into his clear white  soul. Peace be unto you, my friend.\"    \"Isn't he marvellous? Fancy!\" said Mrs Quantock, in an aside.    Georgie raised his hat very politely.    \"How do you do?\" he said. (After his quiet practice he would have said  \"How do you do Guru?\" but it rhymed in a ridiculous manner and his red  lips could not frame the word.)    \"I am always well,\" said the Guru, \"I am always young and well because  I follow the Way.\"    \"Sixty at least he tells me,\" said Mrs Quantock in a hissing aside,  probably audible across the channel, \"and he thinks more, but the years  make no difference to him. He is like a boy. Call him 'Guru.'\"    \"Guru,--\" began Georgie.    \"Yes, my friend.\"    \"I am very glad you are well,\" said Georgie wildly. He was greatly  impressed, but much embarrassed. Also it was so hard to talk at a  second-story window with any sense of ease, especially when you had to  address a total stranger of extraordinary sanctity from Benares.    Luckily Mrs Quantock came to the assistance of his embarrassment.    \"Guru dear, are you coming down to see us?\" she asked.    \"Beloved lady, no!\" said the level voice. \"It is laid on me to wait  here. It is the time of calm and prayer when it is good to be alone. I  will come down when the guides bid me. But teach our dear friend what I  have taught you. Surely before long I will grasp his earthly hand, but  not now. Peace! Peace! and Light!\"    \"Have you got some Guides as well?\" asked Georgie when the Guru  disappeared from the window. \"And are they Indians too?\"    \"Oh, those are his spiritual guides,\" said Mrs Quantock, \"He sees them  and talks to them, but they are not in the body.\"    She gave a happy sigh.    \"I never have felt anything like it,\" she said. \"He has brought such an  atmosphere into the house that even Robert feels it, and doesn't mind  being turned out of his dressing-room. There, he has shut the window.  Isn't it all marvellous?\"    Georgie had not seen anything particularly marvellous yet, except the  phenomenon of Mrs Quantock standing on one leg in the middle of the  lawn, but presumably her emotion communicated itself to him by the  subtle infection of the spirit.    \"And what does he do?\" he asked.    \"My dear, it is not what he does, but what he is,\" said she. \"Why, even  my little bald account of"]]]
