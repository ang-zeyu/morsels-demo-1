The inhabitants of Prussia were originally not Germanic, but  rather Slavish in type; and, indeed, to-day in the forest of  the River Spree, on which Berlin is situated, and only about  fifty miles from that city, there still dwell descendants of  the original Wendish inhabitants of the country who speak the  Wendish language. The wet-nurses, whose picturesque dress is so  noticeable on the streets of Berlin, all come from this Wendish  colony, which has been preserved through the many wars that have  swept over this part of Germany because of the refuge afforded  in the swamps and forests of this district.    The inhabitants of the Rhine Valley drink wine instead of beer.  They are more lively in their disposition than the Prussians,  Saxons and Bavarians, who are of a heavy and phlegmatic nature.  The Bavarians are noted for their prowess as beer drinkers, and  it is not at all unusual for prosperous burghers of Munich to  dispose of thirty large glasses of beer in a day; hence the cures  which exist all over Germany and where the average German business  man spends part, at least, of his annual vacation.    In peace times the Germans are heavy eaters. As some one says,  \"It is not true that the Germans eat all the time, but they eat  all the time except during seven periods of the day when they  take their meals.\" And it is a fact that prosperous merchants of  Berlin, before the war, had seven meals a day; first breakfast  at a comfortably early hour; second breakfast at about eleven, of  perhaps a glass of milk or perhaps a glass of beer and sandwiches;  a very heavy lunch of four or five courses with wine and beer;  coffee and cakes at three; tea and sandwiches or sandwiches and  beer at about five; a strong dinner with several kinds of wines  at about seven or seven-thirty; and a substantial supper before  going to bed.    The Germans are wonderful judges of wines, and, at any formal  dinner, use as many as eight varieties. The best wine is passed  in glasses on trays, and the guests are not expected, of course,  to take this wine unless they actually desire to drink it. I  know one American woman who was stopping at a Prince's castle  in Hungary and who, on the first night, allowed the butler to  fill her glasses with wine which she did not drink. The second  evening the butler passed her sternly by, and she was offered  no more wine during her stay in the castle.    Many of the doctors who were with me thought that the heavy eating  and large consumption of wine and beer had unfavourably affected the  German national character, and had made the people more aggressive  and irritable and consequently readier for war. The influence of diet  on national character should not be under-estimated. Meat-eating  nations have always ruled vegetarians.          CHAPTER III    DIPLOMATIC WORK OF FIRST WINTER IN BERLIN    During this first winter in Berlin, I spent each morning in the  Embassy office, and, if I had any business at the Foreign Office,  called there about five o'clock in the afternoon. It was the  custom that all Ambassadors should call on Tuesday afternoons  at the Foreign Office, going in to see the Foreign Minister in  the order of their arrival in the waiting-room, and to have a  short talk with him about current diplomatic affairs.    In the previous chapter I have given a detailed account of the  ceremonies of court life, because a knowledge of this life is  essential to a grasp of the spirit which animates those ruling  the destinies of the German Empire.    My first winter, however, was not all cakes and ale. There were  several interesting bits of diplomatic work. First, we were then  engaged in our conflict with Huerta, the Dictator of Mexico,  and it was part of my work to secure from Germany promises that  she would not recognise this Mexican President.    I also spent a great deal of time in endeavouring to get the  German Government to take part officially in the San Francisco  Fair, but, so far as I could make out, Great Britain, probably  at the instance of Germany, seemed to have entered into some  sort of agreement, or at any rate a tacit understanding, that  neither country would participate officially in this Exposition.    After the lamentable failure of the Jamestown Exposition, the  countries of Europe were certainly not to be blamed for not spending  their money in aid of a similar enterprise. But I believe that the  attitude of Germany had a deeper significance, and that certain,  at least, of the German statesmen had contemplated a  _rapprochement_ with Great Britain and a mutual spanking  of America and its Monroe Doctrine by these two great powers.  Later I was informed, by a man high in the German Foreign Office,  that Germany had proposed to Great Britain a joint intervention  in Mexico, an invasion which would have put an end forever to  the Monroe Doctrine, of course to be followed by the forceful  colonisation of Central and South America by European Powers. I  was told that Great Britain refused. But whether this proposition  and refusal in fact were made, can be learned from the archives  of the British Foreign Office.    During this period of trouble with Mexico, the German Press,  almost without exception, and especially that part of it controlled  by the Government and by the Conservatives or Junkers, was most  bitter in its attitude towards America.    The reason for this was the underlying hatred of an autocracy  for a successful democracy, envy of the wealth, liberty and  commercial success of America, and a deep and strong resentment  against the Monroe Doctrine which prevented Germany from using  her powerful fleet and great military force to seize a foothold  in the Western hemisphere.    Germany came late into the field of colonisation in her endeavour  to find \"a place in the sun.\" The colonies secured were not habitable  by white men. Togo, Kameroons, German East Africa, are too tropical  in climate, too subject to tropical diseases, ever to become  successful German colonies. German Southwest Africa has a more  healthy climate but is a barren land. About the only successful  industry there has been that of gathering the small diamonds that  were discovered in the sands of the beaches and of the deserts  running back from the sea.    On the earnest request of Secretary Bryan, I endeavoured to persuade  the German authorities to have Germany become a signatory to the  so-called Bryan Peace Treaties. After many efforts and long  interviews, von Jagow, the Foreign Minister, finally told me  that Germany would not sign these treaties because the greatest  asset of Germany in war was her readiness for a sudden assault,  that they had no objection to signing the treaty with America,  but that they feared they would then be immediately asked to  sign similar treaties with Great Britain, France and Russia,  that if they refused to sign with these countries the refusal  would almost be equivalent to a declaration of war, and, if they  did sign, intending in good faith to stand by the treaty, that  Germany would be deprived of her greatest asset in war, namely,  her readiness for a sudden and overpowering attack.    I also, during this first winter, studied and made reports on  the commercial situation of Germany and especially the German  discriminations against American goods. To these matters I shall  refer in more detail in another chapter.    Opposition and attention to the oil monopoly project also occupied  a great part of my working hours. Petroleum is used very extensively  in Germany for illuminating purposes by the poorer part of the  population, especially in the farming villages and industrial  towns. This oil used in Germany comes from two sources of supply,  from America and from the oil wells of Galicia and Roumania. The  German American Oil Company there, through which the American  oil was distributed, although a German company, was controlled by  American capital, and German capital was largely interested in  the Galician and Roumanian oil fields. The oil from Galicia and  Roumania is not so good a quality as that imported from America.    [Illustration: PROGRAMME OF THE MUSIC AFTER DINNER WITH THE KAISER  AT THE ROYAL PALACE, BERLIN.]    Before my arrival in Germany the government had proposed a law  creating the oil monopoly; that is to say, a company was to be  created, controlled by the government for the purpose of carrying  on the entire oil business of Germany, and no other person or  company, by its provisions, was to be allowed to sell any  illuminating oil or similar products in the Empire. The bill  provided that the business of those engaged in the wholesale  selling of oil, and their plants, etc., should be taken over  by this government company, condemned and paid for. The German  American Company, however, had also a retail business and plant  throughout Germany for which it was proposed that no compensation  should be given. The government bill also contained certain curious  \"jokers\"; for instance, it provided for the taking over of all  plants \"within the customs limit of the German Empire,\" thus  leaving out of the compensation a refinery which was situated  in the free part of Hamburg, although, of course, by operation  of this monopoly bill the refinery was rendered useless to the  American controlled company which owned it.    In the course of this investigation it came to light that the  Prussian state railways were used as a means of discriminating  against the American oil. American oil came to Germany through  the port of Hamburg, and the Galician and Roumanian oil through  the frontier town of Oderberg. Taking a delivery point equally  distant between Oderberg and Hamburg, the rate charged on oil  from Hamburg to this point was twice as great as that charged  for a similar quantity of oil from Oderberg.    I took up this fight on the line that the company must be compensated  for all of its property, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7242"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 1. (#7)"],[1,"me cold.    But it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these,  as soon as a man's mercury has got down to a certain point there  comes a revulsion, and he rallies.  Hope springs up, and cheerfulness  along with it, and then he is in good shape to do something for  himself, if anything can be done.  When my rally came, it came with  a bound.  I said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me,  and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides; and straightway  my mercury went up to the top of the tube, and my solicitudes  all vanished.  I was as happy a man as there was in the world.  I was even impatient for to-morrow to come, I so wanted to gather  in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation's wonder  and reverence.  Besides, in a business way it would be the making  of me; I knew that.    Meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background  of my mind.  That was the half-conviction that when the nature  of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious  people, it would have such an effect that they would want to  compromise.  So, by and by when I heard footsteps coming, that  thought was recalled to me, and I said to myself, \"As sure as  anything, it's the compromise.  Well, if it is good, all right,  I will accept; but if it isn't, I mean to stand my ground and play  my hand for all it is worth.\"    The door opened, and some men-at-arms appeared.  The leader said:    \"The stake is ready. Come!\"    The stake!  The strength went out of me, and I almost fell down.  It is hard to get one's breath at such a time, such lumps come into  one's throat, and such gaspings; but as soon as I could speak, I said:    \"But this is a mistake--the execution is to-morrow.\"    \"Order changed; been set forward a day.  Haste thee!\"    I was lost.  There was no help for me.  I was dazed, stupefied;  I had no command over myself, I only wandered purposely about,  like one out of his mind; so the soldiers took hold of me, and  pulled me along with them, out of the cell and along the maze of  underground corridors, and finally into the fierce glare of daylight  and the upper world.  As we stepped into the vast enclosed court  of the castle I got a shock; for the first thing I saw was the stake,  standing in the center, and near it the piled fagots and a monk.  On all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank  above rank, forming sloping terraces that were rich with color.  The king and the queen sat in their thrones, the most conspicuous  figures there, of course.    To note all this, occupied but a second.  The next second Clarence  had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news  into my ear, his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness.  He said:    \"Tis through _me_ the change was wrought!  And main hard have I worked  to do it, too.  But when I revealed to them the calamity in store,  and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender, then saw I also  that this was the time to strike!  Wherefore I diligently pretended,  unto this and that and the other one, that your power against the sun  could not reach its full until the morrow; and so if any would save  the sun and the world, you must be slain to-day, while your  enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency.  Odsbodikins,  it was but a dull lie, a most indifferent invention, but you should  have seen them seize it and swallow it, in the frenzy of their  fright, as it were salvation sent from heaven; and all the while  was I laughing in my sleeve the one moment, to see them so cheaply  deceived, and glorifying God the next, that He was content to let  the meanest of His creatures be His instrument to the saving of  thy life.  Ah how happy has the matter sped!  You will not need  to do the sun a _real_ hurt--ah, forget not that, on your soul forget  it not!  Only make a little darkness--only the littlest little  darkness, mind, and cease with that.  It will be sufficient.  They  will see that I spoke falsely,--being ignorant, as they will fancy  --and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you  shall see them go mad with fear; and they will set you free and  make you great!  Go to thy triumph, now!  But remember--ah, good  friend, I implore thee remember my supplication, and do the blessed  sun no hurt.  For _my_ sake, thy true friend.\"    I choked out some words through my grief and misery; as much as  to say I would spare the sun; for which the lad's eyes paid me back  with such deep and loving gratitude that I had not the heart  to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me  to my death.    As the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was  so profound that if I had been blindfold I should have supposed  I was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people.  There was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity;  they were as rigid as stone images, and as pale; and dread sat  upon every countenance.  This hush continued while I was being  chained to the stake; it still continued while the fagots were  carefully and tediously piled about my ankles, my knees, my thighs,  my body.  Then there was a pause, and a deeper hush, if possible,  and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch; the multitude  strained forward, gazing, and parting slightly from their seats  without knowing it; the monk raised his hands above my head, and  his eyes toward the blue sky, and began some words in Latin; in  this attitude he droned on and on, a little while, and then stopped.  I waited two or three moments; then looked up; he was standing  there petrified.  With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly  up and stared into the sky.  I followed their eyes, as sure as guns,  there was my eclipse beginning!  The life went boiling through  my veins; I was a new man!  The rim of black spread slowly into  the sun's disk, my heart beat higher and higher, and still the  assemblage and the priest stared into the sky, motionless.  I knew  that this gaze would be turned upon me, next.  When it was, I was  ready.  I was in one of the most grand attitudes I ever struck,  with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun.  It was a noble  effect.  You could _see_ the shudder sweep the mass like a wave.  Two shouts rang out, one close upon the heels of the other:    \"Apply the torch!\"    \"I forbid it!\"    The one was from Merlin, the other from the king.  Merlin started  from his place--to apply the torch himself, I judged.  I said:    \"Stay where you are.  If any man moves--even the king--before  I give him leave, I will blast him with thunder, I will consume  him with lightnings!\"    The multitude sank meekly into their seats, and I was just expecting  they would.  Merlin hesitated a moment or two, and I was on pins  and needles during that little while.  Then he sat down, and I took  a good breath; for I knew I was master of the situation now.  The king said:    \"Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter,  lest disaster follow.  It was reported to us that your powers could  not attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but--\"    \"Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie?  It _was_ a lie.\"    That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands everywhere,  and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that  I might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed.  The king was eager to comply. He said:    \"Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom;  but banish this calamity, spare the sun!\"    My fortune was made.  I would have taken him up in a minute, but  I couldn't stop an eclipse; the thing was out of the question.  So  I asked time to consider.  The king said:    \"How long--ah, how long, good sir?  Be merciful; look, it groweth  darker, moment by moment.  Prithee how long?\"    \"Not long.  Half an hour--maybe an hour.\"    There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up  any, for I couldn't remember how long a total eclipse lasts.  I was  in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think.  Something  was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling.  If this wasn't the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this  was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?  Dear me, if I could  only prove it was the latter!  Here was a glad new hope.  If the boy  was right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it _wasn't_  the sixth century.  I reached for the monk's sleeve, in considerable  excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was.    Hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!  It made me turn cold  to hear him.  I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but  he was sure; he knew it was the 21st.  So, that feather-headed  boy had botched things again!  The time of the day was right  for the eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning,  by the dial that was near by.  Yes, I was in King Arthur's court,  and I might as well make the most out of it I could.    The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and  more distressed.  I now said:    \"I have reflected, Sir King.  For a lesson, I will let this darkness  proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out  the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you.  These are  the terms, to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions,  and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship;  but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive,  and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase  of revenue over and above its present amount as I may succeed  in creating for the state.  If I can't live on that, I sha'n't ask  anybody to give me a lift.  Is it satisfactory?\"    There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst  of it the king's voice rose, saying:    \"Away with his bonds, and set him free! and do him homage, high  and low, rich "]]]
