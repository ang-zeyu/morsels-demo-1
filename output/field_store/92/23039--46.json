In memorial of the countless martyrs it had offered, the Roman Church  granted to the order of Trinitarians, or Redemptorist Brothers, whose  duty it was to redeem from slavery the Christians who had fallen into  the hands of the Infidels, the distinction, only granted to this nation,  of wearing a crimson belt. These victims to benevolence were  generally from the establishments near the frontiers, such as those of  Kamieniec-Podolski.] it mingled the most heterogeneous elements, and  thus planted in its very bosom the seeds of ruin and decay.    The general culture of Latin letters, the knowledge of and love for  Italian and French literature gave a lustre and classical polish to the  startling contrasts we hare attempted to describe. Such a civilization  must necessarily impress all its manifestations with its own seal. As  was natural for a nation always engaged in war, forced to reserve its  deeds of prowess and valor for its enemies upon the field of battle, it  was not famed for the romances of knight-errantry, for tournaments or  jousts; it replaced the excitement and splendor of the mimic war by  characteristic fetes, in which the gorgeousness of personal display  formed the principal feature.    There is certainly nothing new in the assertion, that national character  is, in some degree, revealed by national dances. We believe, however,  there are none in which the creative impulses can be so readily  deciphered, or the ensemble traced with so much simplicity, as in the  Polonaise. In consequence of the varied episodes which each individual  was expected to insert in the general frame, the national intuitions  were revealed with the greatest diversity. When these distinctive marks  disappeared, when the original flame no longer burned, when no one  invented scenes for the intermediary pauses, when to accomplish  mechanically the obligatory circuit of a saloon, was all that was  requisite, nothing but the skeleton of departed glory remained.    We would certainly have hesitated to speak of the Polonaise, after  the exquisite verses which Mickiewicz has consecrated to it, and the  admirable description which he has given of it in the last Canto of the  \"Pan Tadeusz,\" but that this description is to be found only in a work  not yet translated, and, consequently, only known to the compatriots of  the Poet. [Footnote: It has been translated into German.--T.] It would  have been presumptuous, even under another form, to have ventured upon  a subject already sketched and colored by such a hand, in his romantic  Epic, in which beauties of the highest order are set in such a scene as  Ruysdael loved to paint; where a ray of sunshine, thrown through heavy  storm-clouds, falls upon one of those strange trees never wanting in his  pictures, a birch shattered by lightning, while its snowy bark is deeply  stained, as if dyed in the blood flowing from its fresh and gaping  wounds. The scenes of \"Pan Tadeusz\" are laid at the beginning of the  present century, when many still lived who retained the profound feeling  and grave deportment of the ancient Poles, mingled with those who were  even then under the sway of the graceful or giddying passions of modern  origin. These striking and contrasting types existing together at  that period, are now rapidly disappearing before that universal  conventionalism which is at present seizing and moulding the higher  classes in all cities and in all countries. Without doubt, Chopin  frequently drew fresh inspiration from this noble poem, whose scenes so  forcibly depict the emotions he best loved to reproduce.    The primitive music of the Polonaise, of which we have no example of  greater age than a century, possesses but little value for art. Those  Polonaises which do not bear the names of their authors, but are  frequently marked with the name of some hero, thus indicating  their date, are generally grave and sweet. The Polonaise styled \"de  Kosciuszko,\" is the most universally known, and is so closely linked  with the memories of his epoch, that we have known ladies who could not  hear it without breaking into sobs. The Princess F. L., who had been  loved by Kosciuszko, in her last days, when age had enfeebled all her  faculties, was only sensible to the chords of this piece, which her  trembling hands could still find upon the key-board, though the dim and  aged eye could no longer see the keys. Some contemporary Polonaises are  of a character so sad, that they might almost be supposed to accompany a  funeral train.    The Polonaises of Count Oginski [Footnote: Among the Polonaises of Count  Oginski, the one in F Major has especially retained its celebrity. It  was published with a vignette, representing the author in the act  of blowing his brains out with a pistol. This was merely a romantic  commentary, which was for a long time mistaken for a fact.] which next  appeared, soon attained great popularity through the introduction of an  air of seductive languor into the melancholy strains. Full of gloom  as they still are, they soothe by their delicious tenderness, by their  naive and mournful grace. The martial rhythm grows more feeble; the  march of the stately train, no longer rustling in its pride of state, is  hushed in reverential silence, in solemn thought, as if its course wound  on through graves, whose sad swells extinguish smiles and humiliate  pride. Love alone survives, as the mourners wander among the mounds  of earth so freshly heaped that the grass has not yet grown upon them,  repeating the sad refrain which the Bard of Erin caught from the wild  breezes of the sea:    \"Love born of sorrow, like sorrow is true!\"    In the well known pages of Oginski may be found the sighing of analogous  thoughts: the very breath of love is sad, and only revealed through the  melancholy lustre of eyes bathed in tears.    At a somewhat later stage, the graves and grassy mounds were all passed,  they are seen only in the distance of the shadowy background. The living  cannot always weep; life and animation again appear, mournful thoughts  changed into soothing memories, return on the ear, sweet as distant  echoes. The saddened train of the living no longer hush their breath as  they glide on with noiseless precaution, as if not to disturb the sleep  of those who have just departed, over whose graves the turf is not yet  green; the imagination no longer evokes only the gloomy shadows of  the past. In the Polonaises of Lipinski we hear the music of the  pleasure-loving heart once more beating joyously, giddily, happily, as  it had done before the days of disaster and defeat. The melodies breathe  more and more the perfume of happy youth; love, young love, sighs  around. Expanding into expressive songs of vague and dreamy character,  they speak but to youthful hearts, cradling them in poetic fictions, in  soft illusions. No longer destined to cadence the steps of the high  and grave personages who ceased to bear their part in these dances,  [Footnote: Bishops and Primates formerly assisted in these dances; at  a later date the Church dignitaries took no part in them.] they are  addressed to romantic imaginations, dreaming rather of rapture than of  renown. Meyseder advanced upon this descending path; his dances, full of  lively coquetry, reflect only the magic charms of youth and beauty.  His numerous imitations have inundated us with pieces of music, called  Polonaises, out which have no characteristics to justify the name.    The pristine and vigorous brilliancy of the Polonaise was again  suddenly given to it by a composer of true genius. Weber made of it a  Dithyrambic, in which the glittering display of vanished magnificence  again appeared in its ancient glory. He united all the resources of his  art to ennoble the formula which had been so misrepresented and debased,  to fill it with the spirit of the past; not seeking to recall  the character of ancient music, he transported into music the  characteristics of ancient Poland. Using the melody as a recital,  he accentuated the rhythm, he colored his composition, through his  modulations, with a profusion of hues not only suitable to his subject,  but imperiously demanded by it. Life, warmth, and passion again  circulated in his Polonaises, yet he did not deprive them of the  haughty charm, the ceremonious and magisterial dignity, the natural yet  elaborate majesty, which are essential parts of their character. The  cadences are marked by chords, which fall upon the ear like the rattling  of swords drawn from their scabbards. The soft, warm, effeminate  pleadings of love give place to the murmuring of deep, fall, bass  voices, proceeding from manly breasts used to command; we may almost  hear, in reply, the wild and distant neighings of the steeds of  the desert, as they toss the long manes around their haughty heads,  impatiently pawing the ground, with their lustrous eye beaming with  intelligence and full of fire, while they bear with stately grace the  trailing caparisons embroidered with turquoise and rubies, with which  the Polish Seigneurs loved to adorn them. [Footnote: Among the treasures  of Prince radziwill at Nieswirz were to be seen, in the days of former  splendor, twelve sets of horse trappings, each of a different color,  incrusted with precious stones. The twelve Apostles, life size, in  massive silver, were also to be seen there. This luxury will cease to  astonish us when we consider that the family of Radziwill was descended  from the last Grand Pontiff of Lithuania, to whom, when he embraced  Christianity, were given all the forests and plains which had before  been consecrated to the worship of the heathen Deities; and that toward  the close of the last century, the family still possessed eight hundred  thousand serfs, although its riches had then considerably diminished.  Among the collection of treasures of which we speak, was an exceedingly  curious relic, which is still in existence.

Oscar had  made eleven voyages in the Anne, and had twice saved the life of  the captain. He was an ugly specimen of the Scotch terrier, and  greatly resembled a bundle of old rope-yarn; but a more faithful or  attached creature I never saw. The captain was not a little jealous  of Oscar's friendship for me. I was the only person the dog had  ever deigned to notice, and his master regarded it as an act of  treason on the part of his four-footed favourite. When my arms were  tired with nursing, I had only to lay my baby on my cloak on deck,  and tell Oscar to watch her, and the good dog would lie down by  her, and suffer her to tangle his long curls in her little hands,  and pull his tail and ears in the most approved baby fashion,  without offering the least opposition; but if any one dared to  approach his charge, he was alive on the instant, placing his paws  over the child, and growling furiously. He would have been a bold  man who had approached the child to do her injury. Oscar was the  best plaything, and as sure a protector, as Katie had.    During the day, many of our passengers took their departure; tired  of the close confinement of the ship, and the long voyage, they  were too impatient to remain on board until we reached Montreal.  The mechanics obtained instant employment, and the girls who were  old enough to work, procured situations as servants in the city.  Before night, our numbers were greatly reduced. The old dragoon and  his family, two Scotch fiddlers of the name of Duncan, a Highlander  called Tam Grant, and his wife and little son, and our own party,  were all that remained of the seventy-two passengers that left the  Port of Leith in the brig Anne.    In spite of the earnest entreaties of his young wife, the said Tam  Grant, who was the most mercurial fellow in the world, would insist  upon going on shore to see all the lions of the place. \"Ah, Tam!  Tam! ye will die o' the cholera,\" cried the weeping Maggie. \"My  heart will brak if ye dinna bide wi' me an' the bairnie.\" Tam was  deaf as Ailsa Craig. Regardless of tears and entreaties, he jumped  into the boat, like a wilful man as he was, and my husband went  with him. Fortunately for me, the latter returned safe to the  vessel, in time to proceed with her to Montreal, in tow of the  noble steamer, British America; but Tam, the volatile Tam was  missing. During the reign of the cholera, what at another time  would have appeared but a trifling incident, was now invested with  doubt and terror. The distress of the poor wife knew no bounds.  I think I see her now, as I saw her then, sitting upon the floor  of the deck, her head buried between her knees, rocking herself to  and fro, and weeping in the utter abandonment of her grief. \"He is  dead! he is dead! My dear, dear Tam! The pestilence has seized upon  him; and I and the puir bairn are left alone in the strange land.\"  All attempts at consolation were useless; she obstinately refused  to listen to probabilities, or to be comforted. All through the  night I heard her deep and bitter sobs, and the oft-repeated name  of him that she had lost.    The sun was sinking over the plague-stricken city, gilding the  changing woods and mountain peaks with ruddy light; the river  mirrored back the gorgeous sky, and moved in billows of liquid  gold; the very air seemed lighted up with heavenly fires, and  sparkled with myriads of luminous particles, as I gazed my last  upon that beautiful scene.    The tow-line was now attached from our ship to the British America,  and in company with two other vessels, we followed fast in her  foaming wake. Day lingered on the horizon just long enough to  enable me to examine, with deep interest, the rocky heights of  Abraham, the scene of our immortal Wolfe's victory and death;  and when the twilight faded into night, the moon arose in solemn  beauty, and cast mysterious gleams upon the strange stern landscape.  The wide river, flowing rapidly between its rugged banks, rolled in  inky blackness beneath the overshadowing crags; while the waves in  mid-channel flashed along in dazzling light, rendered more intense  by the surrounding darkness. In this luminous track the huge  steamer glided majestically forward, flinging showers of red  earth-stars from the funnel into the clear air, and looking like  some fiery demon of the night enveloped in smoke and flame.    The lofty groves of pine frowned down in hearse-like gloom upon the  mighty river, and the deep stillness of the night, broken alone by  its hoarse wailings, filled my mind with sad forebodings--alas! too  prophetic of the future. Keenly, for the first time, I felt that I  was a stranger in a strange land; my heart yearned intensely for my  absent home. Home! the word had ceased to belong to my present--it  was doomed to live for ever in the past; for what emigrant ever  regarded the country of his exile as his home? To the land he has  left, that name belongs for ever, and in no instance does he bestow  it upon another. \"I have got a letter from home!\" \"I have seen a  friend from home!\" \"I dreamt last night that I was at home!\" are  expressions of everyday occurrence, to prove that the heart  acknowledges no other home than the land of its birth.    From these sad reveries I was roused by the hoarse notes of the  bagpipe. That well-known sound brought every Scotchman upon deck,  and set every limb in motion on the decks of the other vessels.  Determined not to be outdone, our fiddlers took up the strain,  and a lively contest ensued between the rival musicians, which  continued during the greater part of the night. The shouts of noisy  revelry were in no way congenial to my feelings. Nothing tends so  much to increase our melancholy as merry music when the heart is  sad; and I left the scene with eyes brimful of tears, and my mind  painfully agitated by sorrowful recollections and vain regrets.        The strains we hear in foreign lands,      No echo from the heart can claim;    The chords are swept by strangers' hands,      And kindle in the breast no flame,               Sweet though they be.    No fond remembrance wakes to fling      Its hallowed influence o'er the chords;    As if a spirit touch'd the string,      Breathing, in soft harmonious words,               Deep melody.      The music of our native shore      A thousand lovely scenes endears;    In magic tones it murmurs o'er      The visions of our early years;--               The hopes of youth;    It wreathes again the flowers we wreathed      In childhood's bright, unclouded day;    It breathes again the vows we breathed,      At beauty's shrine, when hearts were gay               And whisper'd truth;      It calls before our mental sight      Dear forms whose tuneful lips are mute,    Bright, sunny eyes long closed in night,      Warm hearts now silent as the lute               That charm'd our ears;    It thrills the breast with feelings deep,      Too deep for language to impart;    And bids the spirit joy and weep,      In tones that sink into the heart,               And melt in tears.          CHAPTER III    OUR JOURNEY UP THE COUNTRY          Fly this plague-stricken spot! The hot, foul air    Is rank with pestilence--the crowded marts    And public ways, once populous with life,    Are still and noisome as a churchyard vault;    Aghast and shuddering, Nature holds her breath    In abject fear, and feels at her strong heart    The deadly pangs of death.      Of Montreal I can say but little. The cholera was at its height,  and the fear of infection, which increased the nearer we approached  its shores, cast a gloom over the scene, and prevented us from  exploring its infected streets. That the feelings of all on board  very nearly resembled our own might be read in the anxious faces of  both passengers and crew. Our captain, who had never before hinted  that he entertained any apprehensions on the subject, now confided  to us his conviction that he should never quit the city alive:  \"This cursed cholera! Left it in Russia--found it on my return to  Leith--meets me again in Canada. No escape the third time.\" If the  captain's prediction proved true in his case, it was not so in  ours. We left the cholera in England, we met it again in Scotland,  and, under the providence of God, we escaped its fatal visitation  in Canada.    Yet the fear and the dread of it on that first day caused me to  throw many an anxious glance on my husband and my child. I had been  very ill during the three weeks that our vessel was becalmed upon  the Banks of Newfoundland, and to this circumstance I attribute my  deliverance from the pestilence. I was weak and nervous when the  vessel arrived at Quebec, but the voyage up the St. Lawrence, the  fresh air and beautiful scenery were rapidly restoring me to health.    Montreal from the river wears a pleasing aspect, but it lacks the  grandeur, the stern sublimity of Quebec. The fine mountain that  forms the background to the city, the Island of St. Helens in  front, and the junction of the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa--which  run side by side, their respective boundaries only marked by a  long ripple of white foam, and the darker blue tint of the former  river--constitute the most remarkable features in the landscape.    The town itself was, at that period, dirty and ill-paved; and the  opening of all the sewers, in order to purify the place and stop  the ravages of the pestilence, rendered the public thoroughfares  almost impassable, and loaded the air with intolerable effluvia,  more likely to produce than stay the course of the plague, the  violence of which had, in all probability, been increased by these  long-neglected receptacles of uncleanliness.    The dismal stories told us by the excise-officer who came to  inspect the unloading of the vessel, of the frightful ravages of  the cholera, by no means increased our desire to go on shore.    \"It will be a miracle if you"]]]
