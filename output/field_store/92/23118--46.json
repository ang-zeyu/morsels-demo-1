[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],[0,"Wastralls: A Novel (#7)"],[1,"Mill, at the head of the valley, a hamlet had gathered, a  few deep-set cottages built of cliff stone and planted irregularly about  a smithy.  Sheltered by a rise in the land from sea winds their gardens  were rich with produce.  A green broadened from their little gates and  in the wall of the smithy had been set a scarlet post-box, a flaring  touch of the official in a land sufficient unto itself.    In these, houses, which were known far and wide as 'Cottages,' dwelt a  cobbler, who was also the barber of the community: Mrs. Bate, the  Stripper; her friend Aunt Louisa Blewett, the seamstress: one or two  independent labourers, and an old sailor.  Here, too, was the Dolphin,  where could be obtained a little muddy cider and some home-brewed; also,  the village shop. The self-respecting and thrifty community was like a  family which, having grown up and married, had continued to live in a  group, separated only by the walls of their homes and gardens.  Ties,  acknowledged and unacknowledged, linked them, linked them also with the  farmer folk; and, as all respected the axiom that you must not 'step on  a Cornishman's tail,' the hamlet was to the outward eye an abode of  peace.    Mrs. Byron's accident had caught the imagination of her humble  neighbours.  For years they had watched her riding about, a wholesome  hearty woman with a ripe cheek and a commanding eye.  Not one of them,  but had had experience of her vigour and capacity. She was now reduced  to a helplessness greater than that of child or dotard and to her  helplessness was added the mystery of mutilation.    During the long light weeks the cottagers sat at their doors of an  evening and, while Charley Brenton trimmed hair in the front garden,  discussed the inopportune event.    \"I was almost sure there was ill luck comin',\" said Mrs. Bate, the woman  who was Stripper, or Nurse for the hamlet, that is to say who laid out  the dead.    The man upon whom the barber was operating was a Brenton from the  neighbouring valley of Polscore. The gossip was new to him.    \"'Ow d'yer think so?\" he asked.    \"I b'lieve she was ill-wished.  Never mind 'ow I think so, you wait an'  see.  My belief, there's they 'av got an evil eye on 'er.\"    Aunt Louisa Blewett looked up from her sewing.  She was a peculiarly  neat and clean old woman, who spent her time going from one house to  another, mending and making for the long families.  She did not speak,  but her toothless mouth worked as if over a choice morsel.    \"I thought the witches were all gone years ago,\" remarked the stranger  Brenton.    \"Well, there is witches, only they don't come out in their true colour,\"  asserted Mrs. Bate, whose mother was said to have been the last in  Tregols.    \"Besides,\" urged old Hawken, the sailor, who was sitting on a stone  awaiting his turn at Charley Brenton's hands, \"who's goin' to do Mrs.  Byron any 'arm?  A nicer woman never lived.  She's noted for 'er  kindness at Christmas time or any other time.\"    \"Iss, iss, we knaw she's well liked,\" said Mrs. Bate non-committally.  Unlike Aunt Louisa she had still an occasional milestone of tooth.  The  old women were handsome now, and what must they have been when they were  the village belles?  \"Still, I b'lieve there's one that bear 'er a  grudge.  I don't mention any names but you can think 'oo you like.\"    \"Go along, you don't think as 'e'd do 'er a mischief do yer?\"    \"Hush!\"    For some time the sound of approaching hoofs had been carried to them on  the still air of the evening; and the voices died into silence as  Leadville Byron, on his black stallion, clattered by.  The animal was as  usual flecked with foam, the master stained with the mud of the road.  Returning from his humiliating interview with Sabina, he had found in  the hard gallop up hill and down, an outlet for his rage and  disappointment.  What did he care if he lamed the horse?  Whirling  through the hamlet he noticed the curious cottagers no more than the  birds in the hedges.    \"'Ow 'e do ride,\" said old Hawken, as the furious figure melted into the  growing dusk and only the beat of the hoofs reached the listeners, a  beat which in turn was merged in the distant sound of the tide.  \"One of  these days 'e'll break 'is neck.\"    \"'Tis like 'e's tearin' away from something,\" said Aunt Louisa suddenly.    \"Do 'ee think,\" said Mrs. Bate, lowering her voice, \"do 'ee think th'  Old Squire knaw what's happenin' above ground?\"    \"If 'e do,\" said Hawken, \"'e must find it terr'ble 'ard for that feller  to be in 'is place.\"    \"And alterin' things,\" said Aunt Louisa.    \"Old Squire,\" said Mrs. Bate mysteriously, \"can look after's own.  You  mark my words, thiccy feller 'ont 'av all 'is own way.\"    Willie Brenton took the towel from his neck and handed it to the sailor.  \"Your turn, Mr. 'Awken.\"    The old man got up painfully.  \"My feet's terr'ble knucklin' to-day and  my poor laigs is stiff with the rheumatism; but still they'm better'n no  laigs.  I wonder 'ow poor Mrs. Byron'll manage?\"    This was a matter of interest to the cottagers.  They supposed that, for  the cooking and cleaning, Mrs. Byron would employ one of themselves.  Mrs. Bate, who had not been married, had yet grandchildren old enough to  go out to service.    \"We've all worked there in an' out,\" she said, \"but now the poor  thing'll 'av to 'av some one there altogether. She'll be so helpless as  a baby.\"    \"I bet she won't,\" said Aunt Louisa, folding together a patched garment  and preparing to go indoors for the night.  \"Mrs. Byron'll frighten us  all yet for what she can do.\"    \"I reckon she 'ont 'av the 'eaft to go about the work as she used to.  My mind tell me she's done for,\" said Hawken.    Aunt Louisa nodded her trim grey head in the direction of Church Town.  \"Not till she's laid alongside the Old Squire,\" she said and, going in,  shut her door with the precision of touch characteristic of her every  movement.    At Wastralls, the following morning, Byron went as usual into the yard.  Two breeding sows, black as a cave's mouth, were wandering about and, on  a heap of straw in the sun, lay an old sheep-dog.  The dog wagged its  tail but, unfortunately, did not rise and the man's sore heart  registered its laziness as an affront.    \"Shep's gone past for work,\" he said to George Biddick, who was standing  by waiting for orders.    \"Iss, I b'lieve 'e is.  Gettin' blind.\"    \"Better give'm a dose.  You come to me at twelve and I'll 'av it ready  for 'ee.\"  He cast a vindictive look at the old dog.  \"And, Biddick...\"    \"Iss, sir?\"    \"I've changed my mind about the li'l medder.  I'm afraid 'tis too late  for sugar-beet this year, I'll 'av it teeled in dredge-corn.\"    He went back to the kitchen, a roomy whitewashed place, the rafters of  which were dark above the blue flagstones, stones which had been worn  smooth by feet, trampling for a little to and fro, then going as they  had come.  In a wall-cupboard to the right of the slab-range, the farmer  kept such matters as ammunition, packets of seed, medicaments for the  stock.  Crossing the kitchen, with a step which was light for so  large-framed a man, he stood for a moment contemplating the medley of  articles--bluestone, cattle-salts, turpentine, oak-marbles which had  been through the coffee grinder, bottles of Red Drink--which confronted  him.  By the last named stood a small blue bottle with an orange label.  He had bought it some time ago, he had used it on old and useless  animals.  He would pour out a little now and give it to Biddick for the  sheep-dog; but the rest he would put by again.  He felt that to rid the  place of Shep would be a satisfaction.  If only other things which stood  in his way, which refused to recognize his authority, could be got rid  of as easily.    Sabina's interview with her husband had made her realize how necessary  she was to him.  She thought of him as a foolish child who, the moment  it was left to its own devices, got into mischief.  The conviction that  she stood between Leadville and disaster was soothing. It increased her  wish to live and was as good as a tonic. Not that tonics were necessary,  for once she had turned the first difficult corner she made good  progress and, when Raby Gregor came to discuss with her the trolly she  had designed, he was agreeably surprised to find her as cheerful as of  old.    This trolly was for long the wonder of those who saw it.  On a  three-wheeled stand, a cone of cushioned basket-work, itself  strengthened by iron stays, had been set upright.  Into this wicker  receptacle Sabina, who had strong arms, presently learnt to swing  herself and, once in place, the cushions supported her in comfort. The  front wheel of the trolly had a guiding handle and she was thus enabled,  as long as the ground was flat, to go where she would.    \"I want to be on a level with other people,\" she said, \"so don't make  the stand too low.  I can't bear to be down; 'av to look up to everybody  as I'm speaking to'm.\"    The little contrivance, when finished, proved admirably suited to her  needs.  The nurses, proud of her as a case, helped her over the first  difficulties; and, as the figure she cut did not trouble her, she soon  learnt to swing herself in and out.  Before long she was able to steer  herself about the ward and Mrs. Tom, coming in one afternoon with eggs  for the patients and saffron cake for the nurses' tea, found her pushing  herself about as contentedly as a child.    \"I shall be comin' 'ome next week,\" she said happily, \"so Leadville can  send in the cart for me.\"    \"I shall be pretty and glad for 'ee to come 'ome again, but why must 'e  send the old cart?\"    \"Why, to bring this 'ome in.\"  She put her hands to the sides of the  trolly and sat erect, a smiling cheerful woman.  Her face, though pale  from the long confinement, had lost its lines, was indeed showing a  tendency to over-fullness and she looked older, but she was herself  again.  \"If "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#7)"],[1,"in India?\"    He checked his inclination to grumble. \"It isn't a bungalow. It's part  of a Moghul fort, built on the walls of the old city; the wall goes  right round the compound; a compound is----\"    \"Yes, I know what compound means! I know compound, and tiffin, and  chuprassee, and peg, and lots of words. I find them in all the old  family letters put away in the lumber room. Do go on!\"    \"Well, I believe the city in the old days used to come close up to the  wall, but it has gradually been moved farther away. The back of the  house looks on to a desert that stretches for miles----\"    \"Is it a big station?\"    \"No; it's a small civil station; too small considering that it's the  headquarters of a big charge.\"    \"It must be ripping to feel you are ruling, governing all the time!  Don't you love power--spelt with a capital P?\"    \"Who doesn't? But there are definite drawbacks as well as compensations  in Indian service.\"    She sighed. \"I shall never see the country; never feel the Indian sun,  or smell an Indian bazaar. I shall never hear a tom-tom or the frogs'  chorus in the rains, or even see a snake, except in the Zoo or in a  bottle!\"    Colonel Crayfield gazed at the child in astonishment. He guessed nothing  of the grip that the old letters and memoirs, stored in the lumber room,  had on her imagination; he had no conception of the strength of  hereditary memory, of the spell bequeathed by a long line of forbears  whose lives had been spent in the East, whose hearts and minds and souls  had been bound up with India--their mighty relentless mistress. He met,  in puzzled silence, the frank gaze of the lovely limpid eyes that  stirred his blood, tempting him in all opposition to his reason and  foresight; yet, just as his activity in the race to the oak tree had  pleased him, flattered his pride in his physical preservation, so did  this amorous thrill.    Stella looked away, disconcerted; something in his expression reminded  her of his first glance on the platform the previous afternoon; she did  not understand it, and it made her vaguely uneasy. She rose, brushing  her skirt, uttering hasty little remarks--it was getting late, they  ought to go back, breakfast would be ready, look at the sun!    Yes, the sun by now was well up in the sky; a hot summer sun that sucked  the dew from foliage and turf, creating a mist, like smoke, dispensing  strong perfumes of earth, promising great heat for the day. To the man  whose youth lay behind him, it strengthened his ardour, tempting him to  take possession of this exquisite child by means of her mania for India,  her boredom with her present life and surroundings. Then, suddenly, he  remembered that his mission to The Chestnuts was to administer reproof;  to give profitable advice! As they re-started across the common he said  abruptly: \"You know why I have come to The Chestnuts?\"    The girl flushed. \"Yes,\" she said reluctantly; here it was at last, the  lecture, the blame, just when she had almost forgotten. It was beastly  of her godfather. \"Need we talk about it now?\"    \"We shall have to talk about it some time, I suppose.\" His tone  reassured her; it sounded as if, after all, he was rather more on her  side than on that of grandmamma and the aunts. Still she felt  suspicious.    \"What did you do, exactly?\"    \"Well, I made eyes at an awful young man when we were out for a walk in  the town,\" she blushed deeper at the recollection; \"it was just to see  what would happen more than anything else--like pulling a dog's tail.  Oh! I can't explain. Nobody will ever understand----\"    \"And what did happen?\"    With difficulty she told him, and awaited his censure. To her astonished  relief he said: \"Bad luck! You see the wicked don't always prosper!\"    \"But was I so wicked?\" she asked defensively. \"A girl I know told me she  had done the same kind of thing often; she didn't think it was so  dreadful. It seems to me an awful fuss about very little, and I don't  know why you should have been bothered, even though you are my  godfather. What shall you advise them to do?\"    \"At present,\" he said cryptically, \"I am not quite sure.\"    She glanced at him half-alarmed. He laughed. \"How would you like it if  I advised them to send you out to India?\"    Stella gasped. \"Oh! would you? But how? As a missionary, a companion, a  governess--what?\"    Again he laughed. \"As a companion, perhaps. I'm afraid you would not be  much good as a missionary or a governess. What do you think yourself?\"    \"I shouldn't care. I'd do anything to get to India.\"    \"Well, we shall see. Don't be too hopeful,\" he looked at his watch.  \"What time is breakfast?\"    \"Half-past eight--prayers first.\"    \"Then step out!\" Enough had been said for the moment.    \"Oh! dear,\" complained Stella, \"what a bother things are; you are as bad  as Aunt Augusta about being in time. Why don't you marry Aunt Augusta?\"    \"She mightn't appreciate India,\" he said with a grin.    Grandmamma seldom came down to breakfast. Augusta read prayers,  fiercely, glaring at her congregation as though to remind them of their  unworthiness. Ellen kept her eyes shut and responded with fervent  contrition. Neither sister was as yet aware of the guest's early  expedition with their niece, and, as Stella made no mention of it during  the meal, Colonel Crayfield preserved a discreet silence on the subject.  There was a letter for Stella on the breakfast table. The aunts eyed her  with suspicion as she read it and then hastily consigned it to her  pocket. The letter was from Maud Verrall; it contained wonderful news:           \"My dear, what do you think? I am engaged to be married in spite of       all my resolutions not to commit myself in a hurry. No, it is not       poor Fred Glossop, who is wild with despair, but a Captain Matthews       in the Indian Cavalry. He is a positive picture, if you like;       rather in the style of the riding-master I told you about, but       much, _much_ handsomer. My people aren't pleased, but that only       adds to the excitement. There is nothing they can object to       definitely; he has a little money of his own, and isn't badly       connected. Of course, they expected me to choose a lord, or a       baronet at least; but I am very unworldly. I am awfully happy, and       frightfully in love. I am sure I shall enjoy myself hugely in       India. Don't you wish you were me?\"      Stella groaned over this letter in the privacy of her bedroom. Indeed,  how she wished she were Maud!--who was going to India, not as a  missionary, or a governess, nor in any other servile capacity; but as  the wife of a cavalry officer! Colonel Crayfield was wrong; it was the  wicked who prospered. As compared with herself, Maud had certainly been  wicked, and now here was Maud rewarded with all that Stella would give  her ears to attain. She wept with envy; felt convinced that her  godfather had overrated his power to lighten her \"lot\"; and in any case  grandmamma and the aunts would oppose whatever plan he might suggest.  She was doomed to grow old at The Chestnuts; she was never to marry,  never to enjoy herself, never to reach India--the Mecca of her dreams.  If only that beast Maud had not been going to _India_! Stella felt  bitterly jealous; it was all so cruel, so hopeless....    Reluctant to appear with swollen eyelids, she remained in her room for  the rest of the morning; also because she wished to allow her godfather  every chance of imparting his advice, however fruitless it might be, to  her guardians. She presented herself at luncheon, but the atmosphere  seemed unchanged. Evidently nothing had happened, for she was still  ignored by her relations, and Colonel Crayfield, purposely, she  suspected, though not with unkindly intention, paid small heed to her  presence.    After luncheon she was dispatched by Aunt Augusta on household errands.    \"I am being got out of the way,\" said Stella to herself as she set off  with a can of soup for old Mrs. Bly, and an order for bacon and rice at  the post office--the postal department being a sort of incidental  appendage to the only shop of the village; stamps and post cards were  also required. Then she was to call for eggs and butter at a farmhouse  quite a mile and a half away. She made no haste; the longer the palaver  concerning her future, that she hoped was taking place during her  absence, the better. The farmer's wife, Mrs. Capper, made her welcome,  gave her tea with honey and fresh-baked bread, told her \"what a fine  growed young lady she was getting\"; all of which was pleasant and  consolatory for the time being, especially when young Capper came in,  looking quite gentlemanlike in a tweed coat with leather patches on the  shoulders, and breeches and gaiters; he betrayed unmistakable admiration  for his mother's guest--Stella could hardly prevent him from escorting  her home to carry the basket; not that she would have objected to his  company, but somebody would be sure to espy them and tell old Betty, and  old Betty would tell Aunt Augusta, and it would all be attributed to her  own fast and unladylike tendencies, and add to her present disfavour.  The risk was not good enough; young Capper would keep till she knew the  result of Colonel Crayfield's intercession on her behalf. Despite the  little distraction she strolled home listless and depressed.          CHAPTER IV      Tea in the drawing-room was over. Mrs. Carrington sat erect, motionless  as usual. Augusta and Ellen were pretending to knit; in reality their  whole attention was given to Colonel Crayfield, who perambulated about,  large and imposing, his hands in his pockets, a disturbance in the  old-world atmosphere. Augusta noticed with irritation how he scuffled up  the edge of the Persian rug spread in the centre of the room each time  he walked over it. Ellen suspected that he wanted to smoke, but she  dared not suggest the permission. The Carrington ancestor, gaily"]]]
