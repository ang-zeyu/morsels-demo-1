So he called a meeting of all the Whimsies and told them of the offer  made by the Nomes.  The creatures were delighted with the bargain, and  at once agreed to fight for the Nome King and help him to conquer Oz.    One Whimsie alone seemed to have a glimmer of sense, for he asked:    \"Suppose we fail to capture the Magic Belt?  What will happen then, and  what good will all our fighting do?\"    But they threw him into the river for asking foolish questions, and  laughed when the water ruined his pasteboard head before he could swim  out again.    So the compact was made and General Guph was delighted with his success  in gaining such powerful allies.    But there were other people, too, just as important as the Whimsies,  whom the clever old Nome had determined to win to his side.        7.  How Aunt Em Conquered the Lion    \"These are your rooms,\" said Dorothy, opening a door.    Aunt Em drew back at the sight of the splendid furniture and draperies.    \"Ain't there any place to wipe my feet?\" she asked.    \"You will soon change your slippers for new shoes,\" replied Dorothy.  \"Don't be afraid, Aunt Em.  Here is where you are to live, so walk  right in and make yourself at home.\"    Aunt Em advanced hesitatingly.    \"It beats the Topeka Hotel!\" she cried admiringly.  \"But this place is  too grand for us, child.  Can't we have some back room in the attic,  that's more in our class?\"    \"No,\" said Dorothy.  \"You've got to live here, 'cause Ozma says so.  And all the rooms in this palace are just as fine as these, and some  are better.  It won't do any good to fuss, Aunt Em.  You've got to be  swell and high-toned in the Land of Oz, whether you want to or not; so  you may as well make up your mind to it.\"    \"It's hard luck,\" replied her aunt, looking around with an awed  expression; \"but folks can get used to anything, if they try.  Eh,  Henry?\"    \"Why, as to that,\" said Uncle Henry, slowly, \"I b'lieve in takin'  what's pervided us, an' askin' no questions.  I've traveled some, Em,  in my time, and you hain't; an' that makes a difference atween us.\"    Then Dorothy showed them through the rooms.  The first was a handsome  sitting-room, with windows opening upon the rose gardens.  Then came  separate bedrooms for Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, with a fine bathroom  between them.  Aunt Em had a pretty dressing room, besides, and Dorothy  opened the closets and showed several exquisite costumes that had been  provided for her aunt by the royal dressmakers, who had worked all  night to get them ready.  Everything that Aunt Em could possibly need  was in the drawers and closets, and her dressing-table was covered with  engraved gold toilet articles.    Uncle Henry had nine suits of clothes, cut in the popular Munchkin  fashion, with knee-breeches, silk stockings, and low shoes with jeweled  buckles.  The hats to match these costumes had pointed tops and wide  brims with small gold bells around the edges.  His shirts were of fine  linen with frilled bosoms, and his vests were richly embroidered with  colored silks.    Uncle Henry decided that he would first take a bath and then dress  himself in a blue satin suit that had caught his fancy.  He accepted  his good fortune with calm composure and refused to have a servant to  assist him.  But Aunt Em was \"all of a flutter,\" as she said, and it  took Dorothy and Jellia Jamb, the housekeeper, and two maids a long  time to dress her and do up her hair and get her \"rigged like a  popinjay,\" as she quaintly expressed it.  She wanted to stop and admire  everything that caught her eye, and she sighed continually and declared  that such finery was too good for an old country woman, and that she  never thought she would have to \"put on airs\" at her time of life.    Finally she was dressed, and when she went into the sitting-room there  was Uncle Henry in his blue satin, walking gravely up and down the  room.  He had trimmed his beard and mustache and looked very dignified  and respectable.    \"Tell me, Dorothy,\" he said; \"do all the men here wear duds like these?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied; \"all 'cept the Scarecrow and the Shaggy Man--and of  course the Tin Woodman and Tiktok, who are made of metal.  You'll find  all the men at Ozma's court dressed just as you are--only perhaps a  little finer.\"    \"Henry, you look like a play-actor,\" announced Aunt Em, looking at her  husband critically.    \"An' you, Em, look more highfalutin' than a peacock,\" he replied.    \"I guess you're right,\" she said regretfully; \"but we're helpless  victims of high-toned royalty.\"    Dorothy was much amused.    \"Come with me,\" she said, \"and I'll show you 'round the palace.\"    She took them through the beautiful rooms and introduced them to all  the people they chanced to meet.  Also she showed them her own pretty  rooms, which were not far from their own.    \"So it's all true,\" said Aunt Em, wide-eyed with amazement, \"and what  Dorothy told us of this fairy country was plain facts instead of  dreams!  But where are all the strange creatures you used to know here?\"    \"Yes, where's the Scarecrow?\" inquired Uncle Henry.    \"Why, he's just now away on a visit to the Tin Woodman, who is Emp'ror  of the Winkie Country,\" answered the little girl.  \"You'll see him when  he comes back, and you're sure to like him.\"    \"And where's the Wonderful Wizard?\" asked Aunt Em.    \"You'll see him at Ozma's luncheon, for he lives here in this palace,\"  was the reply.    \"And Jack Pumpkinhead?\"    \"Oh, he lives a little way out of town, in his own pumpkin field.  We'll go there some time and see him, and we'll call on Professor  Wogglebug, too.  The Shaggy Man will be at the luncheon, I guess, and  Tiktok.  And now I'll take you out to see Billina, who has a house of  her own.\"    So they went into the back yard, and after walking along winding paths  some distance through the beautiful gardens they came to an attractive  little house where the Yellow Hen sat on the front porch sunning  herself.    \"Good morning, my dear Mistress,\" called Billina, fluttering down to  meet them.  \"I was expecting you to call, for I heard you had come back  and brought your uncle and aunt with you.\"    \"We're here for good and all, this time, Billina,\" cried Dorothy,  joyfully.  \"Uncle Henry and Aunt Em belong to Oz now as much as I do!\"    \"Then they are very lucky people,\" declared Billina; \"for there  couldn't be a nicer place to live.  But come, my dear; I must show you  all my Dorothys.  Nine are living and have grown up to be very  respectable hens; but one took cold at Ozma's birthday party and died  of the pip, and the other two turned out to be horrid roosters, so I  had to change their names from Dorothy to Daniel.  They all had the  letter 'D' engraved upon their gold lockets, you remember, with your  picture inside, and 'D' stands for Daniel as well as for Dorothy.\"    \"Did you call both the roosters Daniel?\" asked Uncle Henry.    \"Yes, indeed.  I've nine Dorothys and two Daniels; and the nine  Dorothys have eighty-six sons and daughters and over three hundred  grandchildren,\" said Billina, proudly.    \"What names do you give 'em all, dear?\" inquired the little girl.    \"Oh, they are all Dorothys and Daniels, some being Juniors and some  Double-Juniors.  Dorothy and Daniel are two good names, and I see no  object in hunting for others,\" declared the Yellow Hen.  \"But just  think, Dorothy, what a big chicken family we've grown to be, and our  numbers increase nearly every day!  Ozma doesn't know what to do with  all the eggs we lay, and we are never eaten or harmed in any way, as  chickens are in your country.  They give us everything to make us  contented and happy, and I, my dear, am the acknowledged Queen and  Governor of every chicken in Oz, because I'm the eldest and started the  whole colony.\"    \"You ought to be very proud, ma'am,\" said Uncle Henry, who was  astonished to hear a hen talk so sensibly.    \"Oh, I am,\" she replied.  \"I've the loveliest pearl necklace you ever  saw.  Come in the house and I'll show it to you.  And I've nine leg  bracelets and a diamond pin for each wing.  But I only wear them on  state occasions.\"    They followed the Yellow Hen into the house, which Aunt Em declared was  neat as a pin.  They could not sit down, because all Billina's chairs  were roosting-poles made of silver; so they had to stand while the hen  fussily showed them her treasures.    Then they had to go into the back rooms occupied by Billina's nine  Dorothys and two Daniels, who were all plump yellow chickens and  greeted the visitors very politely.  It was easy to see that they were  well bred and that Billina had looked after their education.    In the yards were all the children and grandchildren of these eleven  elders and they were of all sizes, from well-grown hens to tiny  chickens just out of the shell.  About fifty fluffy yellow youngsters  were at school, being taught good manners and good grammar by a young  hen who wore spectacles.  They sang in chorus a patriotic song of the  Land of Oz, in honor of their visitors, and Aunt Em was much impressed  by these talking chickens.    Dorothy wanted to stay and play with the young chickens for awhile, but  Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had not seen the palace grounds and gardens yet  and were eager to get better acquainted with the marvelous and  delightful land in which they were to live.    \"I'll stay here, and you can go for a walk,\" said Dorothy.  \"You'll be  perfec'ly safe anywhere, and may do whatever you want to.  When you get  tired, go back to the palace and find your rooms, and I'll come to you  before luncheon is ready.\"    So Uncle Henry and Aunt Em started out alone to explore the grounds,  and Dorothy knew that they couldn't get lost, because all the palace  grounds were enclosed by a high wall of green marble set with emeralds.

His doctrine is briefly  given in the second chapter.    [FN#48]  His Ching Tao Ko (Sho-do-ka), a beautiful metrical  exposition of Zen, is still read by most students of Zen.      After the death[FN#49] of the Sixth Patriarch (A.D. 713), the  Southern Zen was divided into two schools, one being represented by  Tsing Yuen (Sei-gen), the other by Nan Yoh (Nan-gaku.)  Out of these  two main schools soon developed the five[FN#50] branches of Zen, and  the faith made a splendid progress.  After Tsing Yuen and Nan Yoh,  one of the junior disciples of the Sixth Patriarch, Hwui Chung  (E-chu), held an honourable position for sixteen years as the  spiritual adviser to the Emperor Suh Tsung (A.D. 756762) and to the  Emperor Tai Tsung (A.D. 763-779).  These two Emperors were  enthusiastic admirers of Zen, and ordered several times the Kachaya  of Bodhidharma to be brought into the palace from the Pao Lin  Monastery that they might do proper homage to it.  Within some one  hundred and thirty years after the Sixth Patriarch, Zen gained so  great influence among higher classes that at the time of the Emperor  Suen Tsung (A.D. 847-859) both the Emperor and his Prime Minister,  Pei Hiu, were noted for the practice of Zen.  It may be said that Zen  had its golden age, beginning with the reign of the Emperor Suh  Tsung, of the Tang dynasty, until the reign of the Emperor Hiao Tsung  (1163-1189), who was the greatest patron of Buddhism in the Southern  Sung dynasty.  To this age belong almost all the greatest Zen  scholars[FN#51] of China.      [FN#49]  There exists Luh Tan Fah Pao Tan King  (Roku-so-ho-bo-dan-kyo), a collection of his sermons.  It is full of  bold statements of Zen in its purest form, and is entirely free from  ambiguous and enigmatical words that encumber later Zen books.  In  consequence it is widely read by non-Buddhist scholars in China and  Japan.  Both Hwui Chung (E-chu), a famous disciple of the Sixth  Patriarch, and Do-gen, the founder of the Soto Sect in Japan, deny  the authority of the book, and declare it to be misleading, because  of errors and prejudices of the compilers.  Still, we believe it to  be a collection of genuine sections given by the Sixth Patriarch,  though there are some mistakes in its historical narratives.    [FN#50]  (1) The Tsao Tung (So-to) Sect, founded by Tsing Yuen (died  in A.D. 740) and his successors; (2) the Lin Tsi (Rin-Zai) Sect,  founded by Nan Yoh (died in 744) and his successors; (3) the Wei Yan  (Yi-gyo) Sect, founded by Wei Shan (Yi-san, died in 853) and his  disciple Yen Shan (Kyo-zan, died in 890); (4) the Yun Man (Un-mon)  Sect, founded by Yun Man (died in 949); (5) the Pao Yen (Ho-gen)  Sect, founded by Pao Yen (died in 958).    [FN#51]  During the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-906) China produced,  besides the Sixth Patriarch and his prominent disciples, such great  Zen teachers as Ma Tsu (Ba-so, died in 788), who is probably the  originator of the Zen Activity; Shih Teu (Seki-to, died in 790), the  reputed author of Tsan Tung Ki (San-do-kai), a metrical writing on  Zen; Poh Chang (Hyaku-jo, died 814), who first laid down regulations  for the Zen Monastery; Wei Shan (Yi-san), Yang Shan (Kyo-zan), the  founders of the Wei Yang Sect; Hwang Pah (O-baku, died in 850), one  of the founders of the Lin Tsi Sect, and the author of Chwen Sin Pao  Yao, (Den-sin-ho-yo), one of the best works on Zen; Lin Tsi (Rin-zai,  died in 866), the real founder of the Lin Tsi Sect; Tung Shan  (To-zan, died in 869), the real founder of the Tsao Tung Sect; Tsao  Shan (So-zan, died in 901), a famous disciple of Tung Shan; Teh Shan  (Toku-san, died in 865), who was used to strike every questioner with  his staff; Chang Sha (Cho-sha, died in 823); Chao Cheu (Jo-shu, died  in 897); Nan Tsuen (Nan-sen, died in 834); Wu Yeh (Mu-go, died in  823); who is said to have replied, 'Away with your idle thoughts,' to  every questioner; Yun Yen (Un-gan, died in 829); Yoh Shan (Yaku-san,  died in 834); Ta Mei (Tai-bai, died in 839), a noted recluse; Ta Tsz  (Dai-ji, died in 862); Kwei Fung (Kei-ho, died in 841), the author of  'The Origin of Man,' and other numerous works; and Yun Ku (Un-go,  died in 902).    To the period of the Five Dynasties (A.D. 907-959) belong such  teachers as Sueh Fung (Set-po, died in. 908); Huen Sha (Gen-sha, died  in 908); Yun Man (Un-mon, died in 949), the founder of the Yun Man  Sect; Shen Yueh (Zen-getsu, died in 912), a renowned Zen poet; Pu Tai  (Ho-tei, died in 916), well known for his peculiarities; Chang King  (Cho-kei, died in 932); Nan Yuen (Nan-in, died in 952); Pao Yen  (Ho-gen, died in 958), the founder of the Pao Yen Sect.  During the  Sung dynasty (A.D. 960-1126) appeared such teachers as Yang Ki  (Yo-gi, died in 1049), the founder of the Yang Ki School of Zen; Sueh  Teu (Set-cho, died in 1052), noted for poetical works; Hwang Lung (O  ryu, died in 1069), the founder of the Hwang Lung School of Zen;  Hwang Lin (Ko-rin, died in 987); Tsz Ming (Ji-myo, died in 1040); Teu  Tsy (To-shi, died in 1083); Fu Yun (Fu-yo, died in 1118); Wu Tsu  (Go-so, died in 1104); Yung Ming (Yo-myo, died in 975), the author of  Tsung King Luh (Shu-kyo-roku); Ki Sung (Kai-su, died in 1071), a  great Zen historian and author.  In the Southern Sung dynasty (A.D.  1127-1279) flourished such masters as Yuen Wu (En-go, died in 1135),  the author of Pik Yen Tsih (Heki-gan-shu); Chan Hieh (Shin-ketsu,  flourished in 1151); Hung Chi (Wan-shi, died in 1157), famous for his  poetical works; Ta Hwui (Dai-e, died in 1163), a noted disciple of  Yuen Wu; Wan Sung (Ban-sho), flourished in 1193-1197), the author of  Tsung Yun Luh (Sho-yo-roku); Ju Tsing (Nyo-jo), died in 1228), the  teacher to Do-gen, or the founder of the So-to Sect in Japan.      To this age belong almost all the eminent men of letters,[FN#52]  statesmen, warriors, and artists who were known as the practisers of  Zen.  To this age belongs the production of almost all Zen  books,[FN#53] doctrinal and historical.      [FN#52]  Among the great names of Zen believers the following are  most important: Pang Yun (Ho-on, flourished in 785-804), whose whole  family was proficient in Zen; Tsui Kiun (Sai-gun, flourished in  806-824); Luh Kang (Rik-ko), a lay disciple to Nan Tsun; Poh Loh Tien  (Haku-raku-ten, died in 847), one of the greatest Chinese literary  men; Pei Hiu (Hai-kyu, flourished 827-856), the Prime Minister under  the Emperor Suen Tsung, a lay disciple to Hwang Pah; Li Ngao (Ri-ko,  lived about 806), an author and scholar who practised Zen under Yoh  Shan; Yu Chuh (U-teki, flourished 785-804), a local governor, a  friend of Pang Yun; Yang Yih (Yo-oku, flourished in 976), one of the  greatest writers of his age; Fan Chung Ngan (Han-chu an, flourished  1008-1052), an able statesman and scholar; Fu Pih (Fu shitsu,  flourished 1041-1083), a minister under the Emperor Jan Tsung; Chang  Shang Ying (Cho-sho-yei, 1086-1122), a Buddhist scholar and a  statesman; Hwang Ting Kien (Ko-tei-ken, 1064-1094), a great poet; Su  Shih (So-shoku, died in 1101), a great man of letters, well known as  So-to-ba; Su Cheh (So-tetsu, died in 1112), a younger brother of  So-to-ba, a scholar and minister under the Emperor Cheh Tsung; Chang  Kiu Ching (Cho-Kyu-sei, flourished about 1131), a scholar and lay  disciple of Ta Hwui; Yang Kieh (Yo-ketsu, flourished 1078-1086), a  scholar and statesman.    [FN#53]  Of doctrinal Zen books, besides Sin Sin Ming by the Third  Patriarch, and Fah Pao Tan King by the Sixth Patriarch, the following  are of great importance:    (1) Ching Tao Ko (Sho-do-ka), by Huen Kioh (Gen-kaku).  (2) Tsan Tung Ki (San-do-kai), by Shih Ten (Seki-to).  (3) Pao King San Mei (Ho-kyo-san-mai), by Tung Shan (To-zan).  (4) Chwen Sin Pao Yao (Den-sin-ho-yo), by Hwang Pah (O-baku).  (5) Pih Yen Tsih (Heki-gan-shu), by Yuen Wu (En-go).  (6) Lin Tsi Luh (Rin-zai-roku), by Lin Tsi (Rin-zai).  (7) Tsung Yun Luh (Sho-yo-roku), by Wan Sung (Ban-sho).

To understand how Zen developed during some four hundred years after  the Sixth Patriarch, we should know that there are three important  elements in Zen.  The first of these is technically called the Zen  Number--the method of practising Meditation by sitting cross-legged,  of which we shall treat later.[FN#54]  This method is fully developed  by Indian teachers before Bodhidharma's introduction of Zen into  China, therefore it underwent little change during this period.  The  second is the Zen Doctrine, which mainly consists of Idealistic and  Pantheistic ideas of Mahayana Buddhism, but which undoubtedly  embraces some tenets of Taoism.  Therefore, Zen is not a pure Indian  faith, but rather of Chinese origin.  The third is the Zen Activity,  or the mode of expression of Zen in action, which is entirely absent  in any other faith.      [FN#54]  See Chapter VII.      It was for the sake of this Zen Activity that Hwang Pah gave a slap  three times to the Emperor Suen Tsung; that Lin Tsi so often burst  out into a loud"]]]
