I was watching  him yesterday, and he is working away now as if he liked work. He has  the makings of a first-rate sailor. I hold that a man will never become  a first-class seaman unless he likes work for its own sake. There are  three sorts of hands. There is the fellow who shirks his work whenever  he has a chance; there is the man who does his work, but who does it  because he has to do it, and always looks glad when a job is over; and  there is the lad who jumps to his work, chucks himself right into it,  and puts his last ounce of strength on a rope. That is the fellow who  will make a good officer, and who, if needs be, can set an example to  the men when they have to go aloft to reef a sail in a stiff gale. So,  as I understand, Mr. Prendergast, he is going to leave the sea for a  bit. It seems a pity too.\"    \"He will be none the worse for it, Captain. A year or so knocking about  among the mountains of Peru will do more good to him than an equal time  on board ship. It will sharpen him up, and give him habits of reliance  and confidence. He will be all the better for it afterwards, even  putting aside the advantage it will be to him to pick up Spanish.\"    \"Yes, it may do him good,\" the captain agreed, \"if it does not take  away his liking for the sea.\"    \"I don't think it will do that. If the first voyage or two don't sicken  a lad, I think it is pretty certain he is cut out for the sea. Of  course it is a very hard life at first, especially if the officers are  a rough lot, but when a boy gets to know his duty things go more easily  with him; he is accustomed to the surroundings, and takes to the food,  which you know is not always of the best, with a good appetite. Bertie  has had three years of it now, and when he has come home I have never  heard a grumble from him; and he is not likely to meet with such  luxuries while we are knocking about as to make him turn up his nose at  salt junk.\"    The tide was already turning when they reached Gravesend. As soon as  the anchor was down the steward came up to say that dinner was ready.    \"I am not at all sorry,\" Harry said as he went below with the captain.  \"I ate a good breakfast before I started at half-past six, and I went  below and had a biscuit and bottle of beer at eleven, but I feel as  hungry as a hunter now. There is nothing like a sea appetite. I have  been nearly two years on shore, and I never enjoyed a meal as I do at  sea.\"    The crew had been busy ever since they left the dock, and the deck had  now been scrubbed and made tidy, and presented a very different  appearance from that which met Harry's eye as he came on board.    Johnson, the first mate, also dined with the skipper. He was a tall,  powerfully-built man. He was singularly taciturn, and took no share in  the conversation unless directly asked. He seemed, however, to be able  to appreciate a joke, but never laughed audibly, contenting himself  with drawing his lips apart and showing his teeth.    The wind was light and baffling, so that they did not round the South  Foreland until the seventh day after leaving dock. After that it was  favourable and steady, and they ran without any change until they  approached the line; then there was a fortnight of calm. At last they  got the wind again, and made a rapid run until within five hundred  miles of Cape Horn. The captain was in high glee.    \"We have done capitally so far, Mr. Prendergast. I don't think I ever  made so rapid a run. If she goes on like this we shall reach Callao  within three months of starting.\"    \"I don't think the weather will continue like this,\" the mate said.    This was the first original observation he had made since he had  sailed, and Harry and the captain looked at him in surprise.    \"You think there is going to be a change, Mr. Johnson?\" the captain  said, after a short pause to recover from his astonishment.    The mate nodded.    \"Glass falling, sky hazy.\"    \"Is the glass falling? I am ashamed to say I have not looked at it for  the past twenty-four hours. It has stuck so long at the same point that  I have quite ceased to look at it two or three times a day as I usually  do.\"    \"It has not fallen much, but it is sinking.\"    The captain got up from the table, and went to look at the glass.    \"You are right, it has fallen a good eighth; but that may mean a change  of wind. Did you notice any change, Mr. Prendergast?\"    \"No, I can't say that I did. I looked up, as a sailor always does, when  I was on deck this morning, but it was clear enough then, and I have  not noticed it particularly since.\"    But when they went up on deck half an hour later both agreed that the  mate was right. The change overhead was slight, but away to the west a  dull reddish mist seemed to obscure the horizon.    \"We will get the upper sails off at once, Mr. Johnson. These storms  come so suddenly off the coast that it is as well to lose no time in  shortening sail when one sees any indication of such a change.\"    The mate at once gave the necessary orders. The sailors started up with  looks of surprise.    \"Look sharp, men!\" the mate said. \"We shall have wind, and plenty of  it. It will be here before long.\"    The men, who were by no means sorry for a spell of work after going so  long without shifting sail or tack, worked hard, and the white sheets  of canvas were soon snugly furled. By this time all the sailors who had  been to sea for any time recognized the utility of their work. The low  bank had risen and extended the whole width of the western horizon.    \"What do you think, Mr. Prendergast? Have we got enough off her?\"    \"I don't know about your storms here, Captain; but if it were in the  Levant I should get every stitch of canvas off her excepting  closely-reefed topsails, a storm jib, and fore stay-sail. The first  burst over, one can always shake out more canvas. However, you know  these seas, and I do not.\"    \"I think you are right. These pamperos, as we call them, are not to be  trifled with.\"    \"In that case there is no time to be lost, Captain, and with your  permission I will lend a hand.\"    \"All hands take in sail!\" the captain shouted.    The mate led the way up the starboard shrouds, while Harry, throwing  off his coat, mounted those to port, closely followed by Bertie. Five  minutes' hard work, and the _Para_ was stripped for the struggle.    \"That is a good job done,\" the skipper said to Harry as he reached the  deck.    \"A very good job, sir. The wind may come, but we are prepared for it;  there is nothing like being ready in time.\"    \"She is in good trim for it,\" said the captain, \"not above two-thirds  laden, and as the wind is off the land, there is nothing to worry us  except the Falklands. I shall go outside them. Of course that will  lengthen the voyage, but with this westerly wind I should not care  about being between them and the mainland. You think the same, Mr.  Prendergast?\"    \"I do, sir; they are a scattered group, and it would not be pleasant to  have them under lee.\"    It had grown sensibly darker, but the line of mist had not risen  higher. Harry remarked upon this.    \"I almost doubt whether it is coming after all,\" he said.    The captain shook his head.    \"It does not spread over the sky,\" he said, \"because it is largely dust  blown off the land. After the first burst you will see that we shall  have a bright blue sky and a roaring wind, just as one gets it  sometimes in an easterly gale in the Channel. We shall have it in  another five minutes, I fancy. I don't think it will be very strong, or  we should have had it here before this.\"    It was not long before a dull, moaning sound was heard, the brown-red  fog changed its appearance, swirls of vapour seemed to dash out in  front of it, and the whole swelled and heaved as if it were being  pushed forward by some tremendous pressure in its rear.    The ship's head was pointing nearly east, the canvas hung down  motionless, and there was not a breath of wind.    \"Hold on all!\" the captain shouted. Half a minute later the billowly  clouds swept across the vessel, and a sudden darkness overspread them.  Then there was a glow of white light, a line of foam approached as  fleet as a race-horse, and with a shriek the gale was upon them. The  vessel shook from stem to stern as if she had struck against a rock,  and her bow was pressed down lower and lower until she seemed as if she  were going to dive head-foremost. But as she gathered way, her bow  rose, and in a minute she was flying along at some eighteen knots an  hour.    \"She is all right now, Mr. Prendergast,\" the captain said. \"It is well  we stripped her so thoroughly, and that she is not heavily laden.\"    Four men had been placed at the wheel, and it needed all their strength  to keep her from yawing. In half an hour the sea began to get up, and  the captain laid her course south-east, which put the wind on her  quarter.    \"It is well we were not a degree or so farther south, Captain.\"    \"Yes; it would have been as much as we could do to weather the  Falklands; for with this small amount of sail we should have made a  terrible amount of leeway. As it is, all is fair sailing.\"    The darkness gradually passed away, and in an hour after the gale had  struck her the _Para_ was sailing under a bright blue sky. Although but  few points off the wind, she was lying down till her lee scuppers were  under water. The spray was flying over her sparkling in the sun; the  sailors were crouched under the weather bulwark, lashed to  belaying-pins and stanchions to prevent themselves from shifting down  to leewards. Six hours later it was evident that there was some slight  diminution in the force of the wind.    \"She is going about fourteen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/708"],[0,"The Princess and the Goblin (#7)"],[1," I once saw the queen's  feet.'    'Without her shoes?'    'Yes--without her shoes.'    'No!  Did you?  How was it?'    'Never you mind how it was.  She didn't know I saw them.  And what do  you think!--they had toes!'    'Toes!  What's that?'    'You may well ask!  I should never have known if I had not seen the  queen's feet.  Just imagine! the ends of her feet were split up into  five or six thin pieces!'    'Oh, horrid!  How could the king have fallen in love with her?'    'You forget that she wore shoes.  That is just why she wore them. That  is why all the men, and women too, upstairs wear shoes.  They can't  bear the sight of their own feet without them.'    'Ah! now I understand.  If ever you wish for shoes again, Helfer, I'll  hit your feet--I will.'    'No, no, mother; pray don't.'    'Then don't you.'    'But with such a big box on my head--'    A horrid scream followed, which Curdie interpreted as in reply to a  blow from his mother upon the feet of her eldest goblin.    'Well, I never knew so much before!' remarked a fourth voice.    'Your knowledge is not universal quite yet,' said the father.  'You  were only fifty last month.  Mind you see to the bed and bedding. As  soon as we've finished our supper, we'll be up and going.  Ha! ha! ha!'    'What are you laughing at, husband?'    'I'm laughing to think what a mess the miners will find themselves  in--somewhere before this day ten years.'    'Why, what do you mean?'    'Oh, nothing.'    'Oh, yes, you do mean something.  You always do mean something.'    'It's more than you do, then, wife.' 'That may be; but it's not more  than I find out, you know.'    'Ha! ha!  You're a sharp one.  What a mother you've got, Helfer!'    'Yes, father.'    'Well, I suppose I must tell you.  They're all at the palace consulting  about it tonight; and as soon as we've got away from this thin place  I'm going there to hear what night they fix upon. I should like to see  that young ruffian there on the other side, struggling in the agonies  of--'    He dropped his voice so low that Curdie could hear only a growl. The  growl went on in the low bass for a good while, as inarticulate as if  the goblin's tongue had been a sausage; and it was not until his wife  spoke again that it rose to its former pitch.    'But what shall we do when you are at the palace?' she asked.    'I will see you safe in the new house I've been digging for you for the  last two months.  Podge, you mind the table and chairs.  I commit them  to your care.  The table has seven legs--each chair three.  I shall  require them all at your hands.'    After this arose a confused conversation about the various household  goods and their transport; and Curdie heard nothing more that was of  any importance.    He now knew at least one of the reasons for the constant sound of the  goblin hammers and pickaxes at night.  They were making new houses for  themselves, to which they might retreat when the miners should threaten  to break into their dwellings.  But he had learned two things of far  greater importance.  The first was, that some grievous calamity was  preparing, and almost ready to fall upon the heads of the miners; the  second was--the one weak point of a goblin's body; he had not known  that their feet were so tender as he had now reason to suspect.  He had  heard it said that they had no toes: he had never had opportunity of  inspecting them closely enough, in the dusk in which they always  appeared, to satisfy himself whether it was a correct report.  Indeed,  he had not been able even to satisfy himself as to whether they had no  fingers, although that also was commonly said to be the fact.  One of  the miners, indeed, who had had more schooling than the rest, was wont  to argue that such must have been the primordial condition of humanity,  and that education and handicraft had developed both toes and  fingers--with which proposition Curdie had once heard his father  sarcastically agree, alleging in support of it the probability that  babies' gloves were a traditional remnant of the old state of things;  while the stockings of all ages, no regard being paid in them to the  toes, pointed in the same direction.  But what was of importance was  the fact concerning the softness of the goblin feet, which he foresaw  might be useful to all miners.  What he had to do in the meantime,  however, was to discover, if possible, the special evil design the  goblins had now in their heads.    Although he knew all the gangs and all the natural galleries with which  they communicated in the mined part of the mountain, he had not the  least idea where the palace of the king of the gnomes was; otherwise he  would have set out at once on the enterprise of discovering what the  said design was.  He judged, and rightly, that it must lie in a farther  part of the mountain, between which and the mine there was as yet no  communication.  There must be one nearly completed, however; for it  could be but a thin partition which now separated them.  If only he  could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated!  A  few blows would doubtless be sufficient--just where his ear now lay;  but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe, he would only  hasten the departure of the family, put them on their guard, and  perhaps lose their involuntary guidance.  He therefore began to feel  the wall With his hands, and soon found that some of the stones were  loose enough to be drawn out with little noise.    Laying hold of a large one with both his hands, he drew it gently out,  and let it down softly.    'What was that noise?' said the goblin father.    Curdie blew out his light, lest it should shine through.    'It must be that one miner that stayed behind the rest,' said the  mother.    'No; he's been gone a good while.  I haven't heard a blow for an hour.  Besides, it wasn't like that.'    'Then I suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook  inside.'    'Perhaps.  It will have more room by and by.'    Curdie kept quite still.  After a little while, hearing nothing but the  sounds of their preparations for departure, mingled with an occasional  word of direction, and anxious to know whether the removal of the stone  had made an opening into the goblins' house, he put in his hand to  feel.  It went in a good way, and then came in contact with something  soft.  He had but a moment to feel it over, it was so quickly  withdrawn: it was one of the toeless goblin feet.  The owner of it gave  a cry of fright.    'What's the matter, Helfer?' asked his mother.    'A beast came out of the wall and licked my foot.'    'Nonsense!  There are no wild beasts in our country,' said his father.    'But it was, father.  I felt it.'    'Nonsense, I say.  Will you malign your native realms and reduce them  to a level with the country upstairs?  That is swarming with wild  beasts of every description.'    'But I did feel it, father.'    'I tell you to hold your tongue.  You are no patriot.'    Curdie suppressed his laughter, and lay still as a mouse--but no  stiller, for every moment he kept nibbling away with his fingers at the  edges of the hole.  He was slowly making it bigger, for here the rock  had been very much shattered with the blasting.    There seemed to be a good many in the family, to judge from the mass of  confused talk which now and then came through the hole; but when all  were speaking together, and just as if they had bottle-brushes--each at  least one--in their throats, it was not easy to make out much that was  said.  At length he heard once more what the father goblin was saying.    'Now, then,' he said, 'get your bundles on your backs.  Here, Helfer,  I'll help you up with your chest.'    'I wish it was my chest, father.'    'Your turn will come in good time enough!  Make haste.  I must go to  the meeting at the palace tonight.  When that's over, we can come back  and clear out the last of the things before our enemies return in the  morning.  Now light your torches, and come along. What a distinction it  is, to provide our own light, instead of being dependent on a thing  hung up in the air--a most disagreeable contrivance--intended no doubt  to blind us when we venture out under its baleful influence!  Quite  glaring and vulgar, I call it, though no doubt useful to poor creatures  who haven't the wit to make light for themselves.'    Curdie could hardly keep himself from calling through to know whether  they made the fire to light their torches by.  But a moment's  reflection showed him that they would have said they did, inasmuch as  they struck two stones together, and the fire came.        CHAPTER 9    The Hall of the Goblin Palace    A sound of many soft feet followed, but soon ceased.  Then Curdie flew  at the hole like a tiger, and tore and pulled.  The sides gave way, and  it was soon large enough for him to crawl through.  He would not betray  himself by rekindling his lamp, but the torches of the retreating  company, which he found departing in a straight line up a long avenue  from the door of their cave, threw back light enough to afford him a  glance round the deserted home of the goblins.  To his surprise, he  could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary natural cave  in the rock, upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners  in the progress of their excavations.  The goblins had talked of coming  back for the rest of their household gear: he saw nothing that would  have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single  night.  The floor was rough and stony; the walls full of projecting  corners; the roof in one place twenty feet high, in another endangering  his forehead; while on one side a stream, no thicker than a needle, it  is true, but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall,  flowed down the face of the rock.  But the troop in front of him was  toiling under heavy burdens.  He could distinguish Helfer now and then,"]]]
