[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#7)"],[1,"came from the spacious area below.    His first impression was of overwhelming architecture. The place into  which he looked was an aisle of Titanic buildings, curving spaciously in  either direction. Overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the  huge width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material shut out  the sky. Gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams  that filtered down through the girders and wires. Here and there a  gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the  chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. A cliff of edifice  hung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and the opposite  facade was grey and dim and broken by great archings, circular  perforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vast  windows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief. Athwart these  ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering.  Here and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were  fastened, and drooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the  opposite side of the space, and even as Graham noted these a remote  and tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention.  This little figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher  fastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward from a little ledge  of masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent from  the line. Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent Graham's heart into his  mouth, this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round  opening on the hither side of the way. Graham had been looking up as he  came out upon the balcony, and the things he saw above and opposed to  him had at first seized his attention to the exclusion of anything else.  Then suddenly he discovered the roadway! It was not a roadway at all,  as Graham understood such things, for in the nineteenth century the  only roads and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling  rivulets of vehicles between narrow footways. But this roadway was three  hundred feet across, and it moved; it moved, all save the middle,  the lowest part. For a moment, the motion dazzled his mind. Then he  understood.    Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to Graham's  right, an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century  express train, an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping  slats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures  of the street. Upon it were seats, and here and there little kiosks,  but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein. From  this nearest and swiftest platform a series of others descended to the  centre of the space. Each moved to the right, each perceptibly slower  than the one above it, but the difference in pace was small enough to  permit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent, and so walk  uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless middle way. Beyond  this middle way was another series of endless platforms rushing with  varying pace to Graham's left. And seated in crowds upon the two widest  and swiftest platforms, or stepping from one to another down the steps,  or swarming over the central space, was an innumerable and wonderfully  diversified multitude of people.    \"You must not stop here,\" shouted Howard suddenly at his side. \"You must  come away at once.\"    Graham made no answer. He heard without hearing. The platforms ran with  a roar and the people were shouting. He perceived women and girls  with flowing hair, beautifully robed, with bands crossing between the  breasts. These first came out of the confusion. Then he perceived that  the dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume was the pale blue that  the tailor's boy had worn. He became aware of cries of \"The Sleeper.  What has happened to the Sleeper?\" and it seemed as though the rushing  platforms before him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of  human faces, and then still more thickly. He saw pointing fingers. He  perceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade just  opposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blue-clad people. Some  sort of struggle had sprung into life. People seemed to be pushed up the  running platforms on either side, and carried away against their will.  They would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick of the  confusion, and run back towards the conflict.    \"It is the Sleeper. Verily it is the Sleeper,\" shouted voices. \"That is  never the Sleeper,\" shouted others. More and more faces were turned to  him. At the intervals along this central area Graham noted openings,  pits, apparently the heads of staircases going down with people  ascending out of them and descending into them. The struggle it seemed  centred about the one of these nearest to him. People were running  down the moving platforms to this, leaping dexterously from platform to  platform. The clustering people on the higher platforms seemed to divide  their interest between this point and the balcony. A number of sturdy  little figures clad in a uniform of bright red, and working methodically  together, were employed it seemed in preventing access to this  descending staircase. About them a crowd was rapidly accumulating.  Their brilliant colour contrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their  antagonists, for the struggle was indisputable.    He saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm.  And then suddenly Howard was gone and he stood alone.    He perceived that the cries of \"The Sleeper\" grew in volume, and that  the people on the nearer platform were standing up. The nearer swifter  platform he perceived was empty to the right of him, and far across the  space the platform running in the opposite direction was coming crowded  and passing away bare. With incredible swiftness a vast crowd had  gathered in the central space before his eyes; a dense swaying mass  of people, and the shouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous  incessant clamour: \"The Sleeper! The Sleeper!\" and yells and cheers, a  waving of garments and cries of \"Stop the ways!\" They were also crying  another name strange to Graham. It sounded like \"Ostrog.\" The slower  platforms were soon thick with active people, running against the  movement so as to keep themselves opposite to him.    \"Stop the ways,\" they cried. Agile figures ran up swiftly from the  centre to the swift road nearest to him, were borne rapidly past him,  shouting strange, unintelligible things, and ran back obliquely to the  central way. One thing he distinguished: \"It is indeed the Sleeper. It  is indeed the Sleeper,\" they testified.    For a space Graham stood without a movement. Then he became vividly  aware that all this concerned him. He was pleased at his wonderful  popularity, he bowed, and, seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his  arm. He was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked. The  tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence. He  became aware of crowded balconies, of men sliding along ropes, of men  in trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space. He heard voices behind  him, a number of people descending the steps through the archway; he  suddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was back again and gripping  his arm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear.    He turned, and Howard's face was white. \"Come back,\" he heard. \"They  will stop the ways. The whole city will be in confusion.\"    He perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars  behind Howard, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall  man in vivid vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and  all these people had anxious eager faces.    \"Get him away,\" cried Howard.    \"But why?\" said Graham. \"I don't see--\"    \"You must come away!\" said the man in red in a resolute voice. His face  and eyes were resolute, too. Graham's glances went from face to face,  and he was suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavour in life,  compulsion. Some one gripped his arm.... He was being dragged away. It  seemed as though the tumult suddenly became two, as if half the shouts  that had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung into the  passages of the great building behind him. Marvelling and confused,  feeling an impotent desire to resist, Graham was half led, half thrust,  along the passage of blue pillars, and suddenly he found himself alone  with Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward.        CHAPTER VI. THE HALL OF THE ATLAS    From the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment  when Graham found himself in the lift, was altogether barely five  minutes. And as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about  him, as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in  this remote age touched everything with wonder, with a sense of the  irrational, with something of the quality of a realistic dream. He was  still detached, an astonished spectator, still but half involved in  life. What he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed  in the setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing  witnessed from the box of a theatre. \"I don't understand,\" he said.  \"What was the trouble? My mind is in a whirl. Why were they shouting?  What is the danger?\"    \"We have our troubles,\" said Howard. His eyes avoided Graham's enquiry.  \"This is a time of unrest. And, in fact, your appearance, your waking  just now, has a sort of connexion--\"    He spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. He stopped  abruptly.    \"I don't understand,\" said Graham.    \"It will be clearer later,\" said Howard.    He glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the lift  slow.    \"I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen my way about  a little,\" said Graham puzzled. \"It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7766"],[0,"A Dog of Flanders (#7)"],[1,"ugh, and in some sense miserable enough, and  yet their hearts clove to it with a great affection. They had been  so happy there, and in the summer, with its clambering vine and its  flowering beans, it was so pretty and bright in the midst of the  sunlighted fields! There life in it had been full of labor and  privation, and yet they had been so well content, so gay of heart,  running together to meet the old man's never-failing smile of welcome!    All night long the boy and the dog sat by the fireless hearth in the  darkness, drawn close together for warmth and sorrow. Their bodies were  insensible to the cold, but their hearts seemed frozen in them.    When the morning broke over the white, chill earth it was the morning  of Christmas Eve. With a shudder, Nello clasped close to him his only  friend, while his tears fell hot and fast on the dog's frank forehead.  \"Let us go, Patrasche--dear, dear Patrasche,\" he murmured. \"We will not  wait to be kicked out: let us go.\"    Patrasche had no will but his, and they went sadly, side by side, out  from the little place which was so dear to them both, and in which every  humble, homely thing was to them precious and beloved. Patrasche drooped  his head wearily as he passed by his own green cart: it was no longer  his--it had to go with the rest to pay the rent, and his brass harness  lay idle and glittering on the snow. The dog could have lain down beside  it and died for very heart-sickness as he went, but whilst the lad lived  and needed him Patrasche would not yield and give way.    They took the old accustomed road into Antwerp. The day had yet scarce  more than dawned, most of the shutters were still closed, but some of  the villagers were about. They took no notice whilst the dog and the boy  passed by them. At one door Nello paused and looked wistfully within:  his grandfather had done many a kindly turn in neighbor's service to the  people who dwelt there.    \"Would you give Patrasche a crust?\" he said, timidly. \"He is old, and he  has had nothing since last forenoon.\"    The woman shut the door hastily, murmuring some vague saying about wheat  and rye being very dear that season. The boy and the dog went on again  wearily: they asked no more.    By slow and painful ways they reached Antwerp as the chimes tolled ten.    \"If I had anything about me I could sell to get him bread!\" thought  Nello, but he had nothing except the wisp of linen and serge that  covered him, and his pair of wooden shoes. Patrasche understood, and  nestled his nose into the lad's hand, as though to pray him not to be  disquieted for any woe or want of his.    The winner of the drawing-prize was to be proclaimed at noon, and to the  public building where he had left his treasure Nello made his way. On  the steps and in the entrance-hall there was a crowd of youths--some of  his age, some older, all with parents or relatives or friends. His heart  was sick with fear as he went among them, holding Patrasche close to  him. The great bells of the city clashed out the hour of noon with  brazen clamor. The doors of the inner hall were opened; the eager,  panting throng rushed in: it was known that the selected picture would  be raised above the rest upon a wooden dais..    A mist obscured Nello's sight, his head swam, his limbs almost failed  him. When his vision cleared he saw the drawing raised on high: it was  not his own! A slow, sonorous voice was proclaiming aloud that victory  had been adjudged to Stephen Kiesslinger, born in the burgh of Antwerp,  son of a wharfinger in that town.    When Nello recovered his consciousness he was lying on the stones  without, and Patrasche was trying with every art he knew to call him  back to life. In the distance a throng of the youths of Antwerp were  shouting around their successful comrade, and escorting him with  acclamations to his home upon the quay.    The boy staggered to his feet and drew the dog into his embrace. \"It is  all over, dear Patrasche,\" he murmured--\"all over!\"    He rallied himself as best he could, for he was weak from fasting, and  retraced his steps to the village. Patrasche paced by his side with his  head drooping and his old limbs feeble from hunger and sorrow.    The snow was falling fast: a keen hurricane blew from the north: it  was bitter as death on the plains. It took them long to traverse the  familiar path, and the bells were sounding four of the clock as they  approached the hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused, arrested by a scent in  the snow, scratched, whined, and drew out with his teeth a small case of  brown leather. He held it up to Nello in the darkness. Where they were  there stood a little Calvary, and a lamp burned dully under the cross:  the boy mechanically turned the case to the light: on it was the name of  Baas Cogez, and within it were notes for two thousand francs.    The sight roused the lad a little from his stupor. He thrust it in his  shirt, and stroked Patrasche and drew him onward. The dog looked up  wistfully in his face.    Nello made straight for the mill-house, and went to the house-door and  struck on its panels. The miller's wife opened it weeping, with little  Alois clinging close to her skirts. \"Is it thee, thou poor lad?\" she  said kindly through her tears. \"Get thee gone ere the Baas see thee.  We are in sore trouble to-night. He is out seeking for a power of money  that he has let fall riding homeward, and in this snow he never will  find it; and God knows it will go nigh to ruin us. It is Heaven's own  judgment for the things we have done to thee.\"    Nello put the note-case in her hand and called Patrasche within the  house. \"Patrasche found the money to-night,\" he said quickly. \"Tell Baas  Cogez so: I think he will not deny the dog shelter and food in his old  age. Keep him from pursuing me, and I pray of you to be good to him.\"    Ere either woman or dog knew what he meant he had stooped and kissed  Patrasche: then closed the door hurriedly, and disappeared in the gloom  of the fast--falling night.    The woman and the child stood speechless with joy and fear: Patrasche  vainly spent the fury of his anguish against the iron-bound oak of the  barred house-door. They did not dare unbar the door and let him forth:  they tried all they could to solace him. They brought him sweet cakes  and juicy meats; they tempted him with the best they had; they tried to  lure him to abide by the warmth of the hearth; but it was of no avail.  Patrasche refused to be comforted or to stir from the barred portal.    It was six o'clock when from an opposite entrance the miller at last  came, jaded and broken, into his wife's presence. \"It is lost forever,\"  he said, with an ashen cheek and a quiver in his stern voice. \"We have  looked with lanterns everywhere: it is gone--the little maiden's portion  and all!\"    His wife put the money into his hand, and told him how it had come to  her. The strong man sank trembling into a seat and covered his face,  ashamed and almost afraid. \"I have been cruel to the lad,\" he muttered  at length: \"I deserved not to have good at his hands.\"    Little Alois, taking courage, crept close to her father and nestled  against him her fair curly head. \"Nello may come here again, father?\"  she whispered. \"He may come to-morrow as he used to do?\"    The miller pressed her in his arms: his hard, sunburned face was very  pale and his mouth trembled. \"Surely, surely,\" he answered his child.  \"He shall bide here on Christmas Day, and any other day he will. God  helping me, I will make amends to the boy--I will make amends.\"    Little Alois kissed him in gratitude and joy, then slid from his knees  and ran to where the dog kept watch by the door. \"And to-night I may  feast Patrasche?\" she cried in a child's thoughtless glee.    Her father bent his head gravely: \"Ay, ay: let the dog have the best;\"  for the stern old man was moved and shaken to his heart's depths.    It was Christmas Eve, and the mill-house was filled with oak logs and  squares of turf, with cream and honey, with meat and bread, and the  rafters were hung with wreaths of evergreen, and the Calvary and the  cuckoo clock looked out from a mass of holly. There were little paper  lanterns, too, for Alois, and toys of various fashions and sweetmeats  in bright-pictured papers. There were light and warmth and abundance  everywhere, and the child would fain have made the dog a guest honored  and feasted.    But Patrasche would neither lie in the warmth nor share in the cheer.  Famished he was and very cold, but without Nello he would partake  neither of comfort nor food. Against all temptation he was proof, and  close against the door he leaned always, watching only for a means of  escape.    \"He wants the lad,\" said Baas Cogez. \"Good dog! good dog! I will go over  to the lad the first thing at day-dawn.\" For no one but Patrasche knew  that Nello had left the hut, and no one but Patrasche divined that Nello  had gone to face starvation and misery alone.    The mill-kitchen was very warm: great logs crackled and flamed on the  hearth; neighbors came in for a glass of wine and a slice of the fat  goose baking for supper. Alois, gleeful and sure of her playmate back  on the morrow, bounded and sang and tossed back her yellow hair. Baas  Cogez, in the fulness of his heart, smiled on her through moistened  eyes, and spoke of the way in which he would befriend her favorite  companion; the house-mother sat with calm, contented face at the  spinning-wheel; the cuckoo in the clock chirped mirthful hours. Amidst  it all Patrasche was bidden with a thousand words of welcome to tarry  there a cherished guest. But neither peace nor plenty could allure him  where Nello was not.    When the supper smoked on the board, and the voices were loudest  and gladdest, and the Christ-child brought choicest gifts to Alois,  Patrasche, watching always an occasion, glided out when the door was  unlatched by a careless new-comer, and as swiftly "]]]
