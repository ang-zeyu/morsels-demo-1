[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#7)"],[1,". \"A personal friend?\"    \"Never saw him in my life before last night!\" replied the tall man. \"We  just chanced to meet in the train coming down from London, got talking,  and discovered we were both coming to the same place--Wrychester.  So--we came to this house together. No--no friend of mine--not even an  acquaintance--previous, of course, to last night. Is--is it anything  serious?\"    \"He's dead, sir,\" replied Mitchington. \"And now we want to know who he  is.\"    \"God bless my soul! Dead? You don't say so!\" exclaimed Mr. Dellingham.  \"Dear, dear! Well, I can't help you--don't know him from Adam. Pleasant,  well-informed man--seemed to have travelled a great deal in foreign  countries. I can tell you this much, though,\" he went on, as if a sudden  recollection had come to him; \"I gathered that he'd only just arrived in  England--in fact, now I come to think of it, he said as much. Made some  remark in the train about the pleasantness of the English landscape,  don't you know?--I got an idea that he'd recently come from some country  where trees and hedges and green fields aren't much in evidence. But--if  you want to know who he is, officer, why don't you search him? He's sure  to have papers, cards, and so on about him.\"    \"We have searched him,\" answered Mitchington. \"There isn't a paper, a  letter, or even a visiting card on him.\"    Mr. Dellingham looked at the landlady.    \"Bless me!\" he said. \"Remarkable! But he'd a suit-case, or something of  the sort--something light--which he carried up from the railway station  himself. Perhaps in that--\"    \"I should like to see whatever he had,\" said Mitchington. \"We'd better  examine his room, Mrs. Partingley.\"    Bryce presently followed the landlady and the inspector upstairs--Mr.  Dellingham followed him. All four went into a bedroom which looked  out on Monday Market. And there, on a side-table, lay a small leather  suit-case, one which could easily be carried, with its upper half thrown  open and back against the wall behind.    The landlady, Mr. Dellingham and Bryce stood silently by while the  inspector examined the contents of this the only piece of luggage in  the room. There was very little to see--what toilet articles the visitor  brought were spread out on the dressing-table--brushes, combs, a case  of razors, and the like. And Mitchington nodded side-wise at them as he  began to take the articles out of the suit-case.    \"There's one thing strikes me at once,\" he said. \"I dare say you  gentlemen notice it. All these things are new! This suit-case hasn't  been in use very long--see, the leather's almost unworn--and those  things on the dressing-table are new. And what there is here  looks new, too. There's not much, you see--he evidently had  no intention of a long stop. An extra pair of trousers--some  shirts--socks--collars--neckties--slippers--handkerchiefs--that's about  all. And the first thing to do is to see if the linen's marked with name  or initials.\"    He deftly examined the various articles as he took them out, and in the  end shook his head.    \"No name--no initials,\" he said. \"But look here--do you see, gentlemen,  where these collars were bought? Half a dozen of them, in a box. Paris!  There you are--the seller's name, inside the collar, just as in England.  Aristide Pujol, 82, Rue des Capucines. And--judging by the look  of 'em--I should say these shirts were bought there, too--and the  handkerchiefs--and the neckwear--they all have a foreign look. There may  be a clue in that--we might trace him in France if we can't in England.  Perhaps he is a Frenchman.\"    \"I'll take my oath he isn't!\" exclaimed Mr. Dellingham. \"However long  he'd been out of England he hadn't lost a North-Country accent! He was  some sort of a North-Countryman--Yorkshire or Lancashire, I'll go bail.  No Frenchman, officer--not he!\"    \"Well, there's no papers here, anyway,\" said Mitchington, who had now  emptied the suit-case. \"Nothing to show who he was. Nothing here, you  see, in the way of paper but this old book--what is it--History of  Barthorpe.\"    \"He showed me that in the train,\" remarked Mr. Dellingham. \"I'm  interested in antiquities and archaeology, and anybody who's long in my  society finds it out. We got talking of such things, and he pulled out  that book, and told me with great pride, that he'd picked it up from  a book-barrow in the street, somewhere in London, for one-and-six. I  think,\" he added musingly, \"that what attracted him in it was the  old calf binding and the steel frontispiece--I'm sure he'd no great  knowledge of antiquities.\"    Mitchington laid the book down, and Bryce picked it up, examined the  title-page, and made a mental note of the fact that Barthorpe was a  market-town in the Midlands. And it was on the tip of his tongue to  say that if the dead man had no particular interest in antiquities and  archaeology, it was somewhat strange that he should have bought a book  which was mainly antiquarian, and that it might be that he had so  bought it because of a connection between Barthorpe and himself. But he  remembered that it was his own policy to keep pertinent facts for his  own private consideration, so he said nothing. And Mitchington presently  remarking that there was no more to be done there, and ascertaining from  Mr. Dellingham that it was his intention to remain in Wrychester for  at any rate a few days, they went downstairs again, and Bryce and the  inspector crossed over to the police-station.    The news had spread through the heart of the city, and at the  police-station doors a crowd had gathered. Just inside two or three  principal citizens were talking to the Superintendent--amongst them was  Mr. Stephen Folliot, the stepfather of young Bonham--a big, heavy-faced  man who had been a resident in the Close for some years, was known to be  of great wealth, and had a reputation as a grower of rare roses. He was  telling the Superintendent something--and the Superintendent beckoned to  Mitchington.    \"Mr. Folliot says he saw this gentleman in the Cathedral,\" he said.  \"Can't have been so very long before the accident happened, Mr. Folliot,  from what you say.\"    \"As near as I can reckon, it would be five minutes to ten,\" answered Mr.  Folliot. \"I put it at that because I'd gone in for the morning service,  which is at ten. I saw him go up the inside stair to the clerestory  gallery--he was looking about him. Five minutes to ten--and it must have  happened immediately afterwards.\"    Bryce heard this and turned away, making a calculation for himself. It  had been on the stroke of ten when he saw Ransford hurrying out of the  west porch. There was a stairway from the gallery down to that west  porch. What, then, was the inference? But for the moment he drew  none--instead, he went home to his rooms in Friary Lane, and shutting  himself up, drew from his pocket the scrap of paper he had taken from  the dead man.          CHAPTER V. THE SCRAP OF PAPER      When Bryce, in his locked room, drew that bit of paper from his pocket,  it was with the conviction that in it he held a clue to the secret of  the morning's adventure. He had only taken a mere glance at it as he  withdrew it from the dead man's purse, but he had seen enough of what  was written on it to make him certain that it was a document--if such a  mere fragment could be called a document--of no ordinary importance.  And now he unfolded and laid it flat on his table and looked at it  carefully, asking himself what was the real meaning of what he saw.    There was not much to see. The scrap of paper itself was evidently a  quarter of a leaf of old-fashioned, stoutish notepaper, somewhat yellow  with age, and bearing evidence of having been folded and kept flat in  the dead man's purse for some time--the creases were well-defined,  the edges were worn and slightly stained by long rubbing against the  leather. And in its centre were a few words, or, rather abbreviations of  words, in Latin, and some figures:              In Para.  Wrycestr.  juxt.  tumb.            Ric. Jenk. ex cap.  xxiii. xv.    Bryce at first sight took them to be a copy of some inscription but his  knowledge of Latin told him, a moment later, that instead of being an  inscription, it was a direction. And a very plain direction, too!--he  read it easily. In Paradise, at Wrychester, next to, or near, the tomb  of Richard Jenkins, or, possibly, Jenkinson, from, or behind, the head,  twenty-three, fifteen--inches, most likely. There was no doubt that  there was the meaning of the words. What, now, was it that lay behind  the tomb of Richard Jenkins, or Jenkinson, in Wrychester Paradise?--in  all probability twenty-three inches from the head-stone, and fifteen  inches beneath the surface. That was a question which Bryce immediately  resolved to find a satisfactory answer to; in the meantime there were  other questions which he set down in order on his mental tablets. They  were these:     1.  Who, really, was the man who had registered at the       Mitre under the name of John Braden?     2.  Why did he wish to make a personal call on the       Duke of Saxonsteade?     3.  Was he some man who had known Ransford in time       past--and whom Ransford had no desire to meet again?     4.  Did Ransford meet him--in the Cathedral?     5.  Was it Ransford who flung him to his death down       St. Wrytha's Stair?     6.  Was that the real reason of the agitation in which       he, Bryce, had found Ransford a few moments after       the discovery of the body?    There was plenty of time before him for the due solution of these  mysteries, reflected Bryce--and for solving another problem which might  possibly have some relationship to them--that of the exact connection  between Ransford and his two wards. Bryce, in telling Ransford that  morning of what was being said amongst the tea-table circles of the old  cathedral city, had purposely only told him half a tale. He knew,  and had known for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#7)"],[1," had asserted that Tennyson was a greater  poet than Walt Whitman; and the boosters of the Camden poet had  enlivened the evening with missiles. It seems that the chief Whitman  disciple in Camden is Mr. Traubel; and Mr. Mifflin had started the  rumpus by asserting that Tennyson, too, had \"Traubels of his own.\"  What an absurd creature the Professor was, I thought, as I lay  comfortably lulled by the rolling wheels.    Greenbriar is a straggling little town, built around a large common  meadow. Mifflin's general plan in towns, he had told me, was to  halt Parnassus in front of the principal store or hotel, and when  a little throng had gathered he would put up the flaps of the van,  distribute his cards, and deliver a harangue on the value of good  books. I lay concealed inside, but I gathered from the sounds that  this was what was happening. We came to a stop; I heard a growing  murmur of voices and laughter outside, and then the click of the  raised sides of the wagon. I heard Mifflin's shrill, slightly nasal  voice making facetious remarks as he passed out the cards. Evidently  Bock was quite accustomed to the routine, for though his tail wagged  gently when the Professor began to talk, he lay quite peaceably  dozing at my feet.    \"My friends,\" said Mr. Mifflin. \"You remember Abe Lincoln's joke  about the dog? If you call a tail a leg, said Abe, how many legs  has a dog? Five, you answer. No, says Abe; because calling a tail a  leg doesn't make it a leg. Well, there are lots of us in the same  case as that dog's tail. Calling us men doesn't _make_ us men. No  creature on earth has a right to think himself a human being if he  doesn't know at least one good book. The man that spends every  evening chewing Piper Heidsieck at the store is unworthy to catch  the intimations of a benevolent Creator. The man that's got a few  good books on his shelf is making his wife happy, giving his  children a square deal, and he's likely to be a better citizen  himself. How about that, parson?\"    I heard the deep voice of Reverend Kane, the Methodist minister:  \"You're dead right, Professor!\" he shouted. \"Tell us some more about  books. I'm right with you!\" Evidently Mr. Kane had been attracted  by the sight of Parnassus, and I could hear him muttering to himself  as he pulled one or two books from the shelves. How surprised he  would have been if he had known I was inside the van! I took the  precaution of slipping the bolt of the door at the back, and drew  the curtains. Then I crept back into the bunk. I began to imagine  what an absurd situation there would be if Andrew should arrive on  the scene.    \"You are all used to hucksters and pedlars and fellows selling every  kind of junk from brooms to bananas,\" said the Professor's voice.  \"But how often does any one come round here to sell you books?  You've got your town library, I dare say; but there are some books  that folks ought to own. I've got 'em all here from Bibles to cook  books. They'll speak for themselves. Step up to the shelves,  friends, and pick and choose.\"    I heard the parson asking the price of something he had found on the  shelves, and I believe he bought it; but the hum of voices around  the flanks of Parnassus was very soothing, and in spite of my  interest in what was going on I'm afraid I fell asleep. I must have  been pretty tired; anyway I never felt the van start again. The  Professor says he looked in through the little window from the  driver's seat, and saw me sound asleep. And the next thing I knew I  woke up with a start to find myself rolling leisurely in the dark.  Bock was still lying over my feet, and there was a faint, musical  clang from the bucket under the van which struck against something  now and then. The Professor was sitting in front, with a lighted  lantern hanging from the peak of the van roof. He was humming some  outlandish song to himself, with a queer, monotonous refrain:      Shipwrecked was I off Soft Perowse      And right along the shore,    And so I did resolve to roam      The country to explore.    Tommy rip fal lal and a balum tip      Tommy rip fal lal I dee;    And so I did resolve to roam      The country for to see!    I jumped out of the bunk, cracked my shins against something, and  uttered a rousing halloo. Parnassus stopped, and the Professor  pushed back the sliding window behind the driver's seat.    \"Heavens!\" I said. \"Father Time, what o'clock is it?\"    \"Pretty near supper time, I reckon. You must have fallen asleep  while I was taking money from the Philistines. I made nearly three  dollars for you. Let's pull up along the road and have a bite to  eat.\"    He guided Pegasus to one side of the road, and then showed me how  to light the swinging lamp that hung under the skylight. \"No use  to light the stove on a lovely evening like this,\" he said. \"I'll  collect some sticks and we can cook outside. You get out your basket  of grub and I'll make a fire.\" He unhitched Pegasus, tied her to a  tree, and gave her a nose bag of oats. Then he rooted around for  some twigs and had a fire going in a jiffy. In five minutes I had  bacon and scrambled eggs sizzling in a frying pan, and he had  brought out a pail of water from the cooler under the bunk, and was  making tea.    I never enjoyed a picnic so much! It was a perfect autumn evening,  windless and frosty, with a dead black sky and a tiny rim of new  moon like a thumb-nail paring. We had our eggs and bacon, washed  down with tea and condensed milk, and followed by bread and jam.  The little fire burned blue and cozy, and we sat on each side of it  while Bock scoured the pan and ate the crusts.    \"This your own bread, Miss McGill?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" I said. \"I was calculating the other day that I've baked more  than 400 loaves a year for the last fifteen years. That's more than  6,000 loaves of bread. They can put that on my tombstone.\"    \"The art of baking bread is as transcendent a mystery as the art of  making sonnets,\" said Redbeard. \"And then your hot biscuits--they  might be counted as shorter lyrics, I suppose--triolets perhaps.  That makes quite an anthology, or a doxology, if you prefer it.\"    \"Yeast is yeast, and West is West,\" I said, and was quite surprised  at my own cleverness. I hadn't made a remark like that to Andrew in  five years.    \"I see you are acquainted with Kipling,\" he said.    \"Oh, yes, every governess is.\"    \"Where and whom did you govern?\"    \"I was in New York, with the family of a wealthy stockbroker. There  were three children. I used to take them walking in Central Park.\"    \"Did you ever go to Brooklyn?\" he asked abruptly.    \"Never,\" I replied.    \"Ah!\" he said. \"That's just the trouble. New York is Babylon;  Brooklyn is the true Holy City. New York is the city of envy, office  work, and hustle; Brooklyn is the region of homes and happiness. It  is extraordinary: poor, harassed New Yorkers presume to look down on  low-lying, home-loving Brooklyn, when as a matter of fact it is the  precious jewel their souls are thirsting for and they never know it.  Broadway: think how symbolic the name is. Broad is the way that  leadeth to destruction! But in Brooklyn the ways are narrow, and  they lead to the Heavenly City of content. Central Park: there you  are--the centre of things, hemmed in by walls of pride. Now how  much better is Prospect Park, giving a fair view over the hills of  humility! There is no hope for New Yorkers, for they glory in their  skyscraping sins; but in Brooklyn there is the wisdom of the lowly.\"    \"So you think that if I had been a governess in Brooklyn I should  have been so contented that I would never have come with Andrew  and compiled my anthology of 6,000 loaves of bread and the lesser  lyrics?\"    But the volatile Professor had already soared to other points of  view, and was not to be thwarted by argument.    \"Of course Brooklyn is a dingy place, really,\" he admitted. \"But to  me it symbolizes a state of mind, whereas New York is only a state  of pocket. You see I was a boy in Brooklyn: it still trails clouds  of glory for me. When I get back there and start work on my book  I shall be as happy as Nebuchadnezzar when he left off grass and  returned to tea and crumpets. 'Literature Among the Farmers' I'm  going to call it, but that's a poor title. I'd like to read you some  of my notes for it.\"    I'm afraid I poorly concealed a yawn. As a matter of fact I was  sleepy, and it was growing chilly.    \"Tell me first,\" I said, \"where in the world are we, and what time  is it?\"    He pulled out a turnip watch. \"It's nine o'clock,\" he said, \"and  we're about two miles from Shelby, I should reckon. Perhaps we'd  better get along. They told me in Greenbriar that the Grand Central  Hotel in Shelby is a good place to stop at. That's why I wasn't  anxious to get there. It sounds so darned like New York.\"    He bundled the cooking utensils back into Parnassus, hitched Peg up  again, and tied Bock to the stern of the van. Then he insisted on  giving me the two dollars and eighty cents he had collected in  Greenbriar. I was really too sleepy to protest, and of course it was  mine anyway. We creaked off along the dark and silent road between  the pine woods. I think he talked fluently about his pilgrim's  progress among the farmers of a dozen states, but (to be honest)  I fell asleep in my corner of the seat. I woke up when we halted  before the one hotel in Shelby--a plain, unimposing country inn,  despite its absurd name. I left him to put Parnassus and the animals  away for the night, while I engaged a room. Just as I got my key  from the clerk he came into the dingy lobby.    \"Well, Mr. Mifflin,\" I said. \"Shall I see you in the morning?\"    \"I had intended to push on to Port Vigor to-night,\" he said, \"but as  it's fully eight miles (they tell me), I guess I'll bivouac here. I  think I'll go into the smoking-room and put them wise to some good  books. We won't say good-bye till to-morrow.\"    My"]]]
