This region of the  colony is remarkably dry, and stock of all kinds thrive well and are  very free from disease. At Bourke, the driest place in the colony, the  humidity for a long series of years is--in the spring 51 degrees, in the  summer 49 degrees, in the autumn 61 degrees, and in the winter 74 degrees.  At Sydney the humidity in the Spring is 69 degrees, in the summer 70  degrees, in the autumn 79 degrees, and in the winter 79 degrees.    Victoria.--The humidity of the air of Melbourne is low, the average  being 71 per cent. In the summer it falls to 65, and on hot days is  generally very low. The characteristic of our hot weather is that it is  usually extremely dry; the exceptions are very few, and occur in the  late Spring and early autumn during thundery, muggy weather. On the  hottest days, with north winds, the dryness makes the heat much more  endurable, and the humidity frequently falls to between 30 and 40 per  cent.    South Australia.--Attention has already been drawn to the fact that  the hot, dry air met with on the Adelaide plains is far more endurable  than a lower temperature in which the atmosphere is surcharged with  aqueous vapour. A damp atmosphere is a rare thing in South  Australia during the summer, though in March there are at times some  warm and humid days. In the winter the air for the most part is dry,  although the nights are often damp. The Mount Lofty Ranges, close to  Adelaide, afford a cool retreat; they have a very large rainfall, in  some years over 50 inches. The climate at Mount Gambier, in the  south-eastern part of the colony, is cooler and damper; it has also a much  heavier rainfall than the Adelaide plains.    OF WHAT DURATION ARE THE DIFFERENT SEASONS, AND TO WHAT MONTHS WOULD  YOU APPORTION EACH SEASON?    New South Wales and Victoria.--Spring--September, October, November;  Summer--December, January, February; Autumn--March, April, May;  Winter--June, July, August.    South Australia.--Spring--September, October; Summer comprises the  five months from November to March inclusive; Autumn--April, May;  Winter--June, July, August. Practically, in South Australia the year  may be divided into two seasons, namely, Spring, the seven months from  April to October inclusive; and Summer, the five months from November  to March inclusive.    Queensland.--With regard to Southern Queensland, the seasons may be  provisionally apportioned as follows: Spring--August, September,  October; Summer--November, December, January, February, Autumn--  March, April, May; Winter--June, July.    WHAT ARE THE PREVAILING WINDS, AND WHAT PARTICULAR ROLE DO THE HOT  WINDS PLAY?    New South Wales.--A general statement is not sufficient, for the winds  vary much at different places; but taking the colony as a whole, its  prevailing winds come from some point between north-west and  south-west, and hence the dry climate. In Sydney no less than 39.6 per  cent. of the wind comes from this quarter. The winds known as southerly  bursters are generally to be expected from November to the end of  February; they are always attended with strong electrical excitement, a  stream of sparks being sometimes produced for an hour at the  electrometer. The approach of the true burster is indicated by a  peculiar roll of clouds, which, when once seen, cannot be mistaken. It  is just above the South horizon, and extends on either side of it 15  degrees or 20  degrees, and looks as if a thin sheet of cloud were being  rolled up like a scroll by the advancing wind. The change of wind is  sometimes very sudden; it may be fresh N.E. and in ten minutes a gale  from S. Hence vessels not on the look-out are sometimes caught unprepared,  and suffer accordingly. When a southerly wind commences anywhere south of  Sydney it is at once telegraphed to its principal coast towns, and a  signal put up indicating its approach. As to the hot winds, they are so  insignificant in number that it cannot be said they play any particular  ROLE. Their effect is to raise the temperature, because they flow from  the heated interior of Australia; but they do not last long. and for  the majority of people are dry, healthy winds. Indeed, they are by no  means so oppressive as the warm north-east wind, so charged with  moisture, which comes in the summer.    Victoria.--In summer the N. winds blow to the extent of 8 per cent.,  the S.W. winds 24.1 per cent., and the S. winds 201 per cent.  Northerly, or warm-quarter winds, in summer are 20 per cent., and  southerly, or cool-quarter winds, 64 per cent. The northerly winds in  winter, however, are bleak and cold, like easterly winds in England.  The particular ROLE played by the hot wind is to precede a cyclonic  movement, and is always in front of a low pressure area or V-shaped  depression. It is frequently followed by thunderstorms and rain  of short duration. It dries the surface and raises dust storms when  strong. So far as its effects on the people are concerned, it does not  appear to hinder the ordinary occupations of life. Some invalids are  better during its continuance, some worse; but all weakly people feel  some depression after \"the change\" comes. The aged are generally better  in hot winds, unless they suffer from disease.    South Australia.--As far as the southern regions of the colony are  concerned, we may say, speaking generally, that light winds and calms  are a very distinctive characteristic. The prevailing wind in the  summer is the S.E., varied by sea-breezes during the day. In the winter  there are mostly dry, cold N.E. winds, broken at intervals by westerly  and S.W. gales of moderate strength, squalls, and rain. The best and  heaviest rainfalls are those which set in with the surface winds at  N.E., the rain increasing in intensity as the wind veers to N.W., and  breaking up into showers and squalls as it veers to S.W. In the  interior, north of, say, latitude 30 degrees to about 18 degreess., the  prevailing wind all the year is the S.E. North of latitude 18 degrees to  the north coast the country is well within the influence of the north-nest  monsoon during the summer months, with frequent thunderstorms and heavy  rains; and during, the winter dry S.E. winds prevail.    Queensland.--Eastern Queensland (or rather the Pacific Slope) is very  seldom troubled with hot winds. The hot winds of \"continental\"  Queensland are always very dry, and are usually accompanied by dust  storms.          CHAPTER II.        THE ALPHABETICAL PENTAGON OF HEALTH FOR AUSTRALIA.      A few introductory remarks on this subject will serve a useful purpose.  It will be seen that I have referred to the alphabetical pentagon of  health--which is purely a provisional arrangement of my own. It  consists of five headings, which fall naturally into alphabetical  order. They are best considered, therefore, in the following way,  namely:    * (a) Ablution--the Skin and the Bath.  *  * (b) Bedroom Ventilation.  *  * (c) Clothing.  *  * (d) Diet.  *  * (e) Exercise.  *    This is a convenient method of remembering the five great fundamental  principles concerned in the preservation of health. It will serve,  moreover, as a means of impressing them upon the memory, superior to  any other with which I am acquainted.    This very number five, indeed, has a more than ordinary significance  belonging to itself. It has been termed a mystical number. \"Five,\" says  Pythagoras, \"has peculiar force in expiations. It is everything. It  stops the power of poisons and is redoubted by evil spirits.\" According  to the Pythagorean school of philosophy, the world is a piece of  harmony and man the full chord. The major chord consists of a  fundamental or tonic, its major third and its just fifth. The eighth  note, or complement of the octave, is the diapason of man. These are of  course very highly imaginative speculations. It is interesting to  remember, however, that the system of astronomy first taught by  Pythagoras was afterwards developed into the solar system by  Copernicus, and is now received as the Copernican system. But, turning  from grave to gay, we find that five wits have been described, viz.,  common sense, imagination, fantasy, estimation, and memory. Of these,  common sense passes judgment on all things; imagination brings the mind  to realise what comes before it; fantasy stimulates the mind to act;  estimation has to do with all that pertains to time, space, locality,  etc.; and memory is \"the warder of the brain.\" Then again, have we not  also the five senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, and  tasting? Have we not likewise five fingers and five toes on either hand  and foot? Moreover, is not fives an ancient and hollowed game, still  popular wherever the English language is spoken, and is not its name  derived from its being played with the \"bunch of FIVES,\" namely the  hand? And further, there must be numbers of Australians who know well  what \"five-corners\" are. In addition to the foregoing, the number five  has an important historical and legal association in connection with  the Code Napoleon. Prior to Napoleon's time, different ways and customs  prevailed in different parts of France, and altogether legal matters  were in a chaotic state. It was greatly to his credit, therefore that  he recognised the necessity for the entire alteration and remodelling  of the whole system. But what was more striking than the recognition of  the existing, defects was the speediness with which they were  rectified, for the CODE NAPOLEON was devised and actually in operation  between 1804 and 1810.

[42] Doc. and Cov. xlix, 24-25.    =33.= A most remarkable prediction regarding national affairs was  uttered by Joseph Smith, December 25th, 1832; it was soon thereafter  promulgated among the members of the Church, and was preached by the  elders, but did not appear in print until 1851.[43] The revelation  reads in part as follows:--\"Verily thus saith the Lord, concerning the  wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of  South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and  misery of many souls. The days will come that war will be poured out  upon all nations, beginning at that place; For, behold, the Southern  States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern  States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great  Britain; ... And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall  rise up against their masters, who shall be marshalled and disciplined  for war.\" Every student of United States history is acquainted with  the facts establishing a complete fulfilment, even to the minutest  detail, of this astounding prophecy. In 1861, more than twenty-eight  years after the foregoing prediction was recorded, and ten years after  its publication in England, the Civil War broke out, beginning in  South Carolina. The ghastly records of that fratricidal strife sadly  support the prediction concerning \"the death and misery of many  souls.\" It is well known that slaves deserted the South and were  marshalled in the armies of the North, and that the Confederate States  solicited aid of Great Britain. While no open alliance between the  Southern States and England was effected, the British government gave  indirect assistance and substantial encouragement to the South, and  this in such a way as to produce serious international complications.  Vessels were built and equipped at British ports in the interests of  the Confederacy; and the results of this violation of the laws of  neutrality cost Great Britain the sum of fifteen and a half millions  of dollars, which sum was awarded the United States at the Geneva  arbitration in settlement of the \"Alabama claims.\" The Confederacy  appointed commissioners to Great Britain and France; these appointees  were forcibly taken by United States officers from the British steamer  on which they had embarked. This act, which the United States  government had to admit as overt, threatened for a time to precipitate  a war between this nation and Great Britain.      [43] See Pearl of Great Price, British edition of 1851, and    Millennial Star, Vol. XLIX, p. 396. The prophecy is now a part of    the Doctrine and Covenants, see section lxxxvii.    =34.= The revelation cited, as given through Joseph Smith, contained  other predictions, some of which are yet awaiting fulfilment.[44] The  evidence presented is sufficient to prove that Joseph Smith is  prominent among men by reason of his instrumentality in fulfilling  prophecies uttered by the Lord's representatives in former times, and  that his own claim to the rank of prophet is abundantly vindicated.  But the endowment of prophecy so richly bestowed upon this Elias of  the last days, and so freely yet unerringly exercised by him, is but  one of the many spiritual gifts by which he, in common with a host of  others who have received the priesthood from him, was distinguished.  The scriptures declare that certain signs shall attend the Church of  Christ, among them the gifts of tongues, healing, immunity from  threatening death, and the power to control evil spirits.[45] The  exercise of these powers, resulting in what are ordinarily termed  miracles, is by no means an infallible proof of divine authority; for  many true prophets have wrought no such wonders, and men have been  known to work miracles at the instigation of evil spirits.[46]  Nevertheless, the possession of the power implied by the working of  miracles is an essential characteristic of the Church; and when such  acts are wrought in the accomplishment of holy purposes, they serve as  confirmatory evidence of divine authority. Therefore we may expect to  find, as find we do, in the ministry of Joseph Smith and in that of  the Church in general, the attested record of miracles, comprising  manifestations of all the promised gifts of the Spirit. This subject  will be further considered on another occasion.[47]      [44] See Doc. and Cov. lxxxvii, 5-7.      [45] Mark xvi, 16-18; Luke x, 19, etc.; Doc. and Cov. lxxxiv,    65-72.

The Doctrines Taught by Joseph Smith= and by the Church  to-day are true and scriptural. To sustain this statement we must  examine the principal teachings of the Church in separate order. The  Articles of Faith furnish us a convenient summary of many of the  doctrines pertaining to the latter-day work; and these we will proceed  to study in the course of the lectures that are to follow.      NOTES.         =1. The \"Articles of Faith\"= date from March 1, 1841. They       constitute a portion of a letter from the Prophet Joseph Smith to       a Mr. Wentworth, of Chicago. The \"Articles\" were published in the       History of Joseph Smith: (See _Millennial Star_, vol. XIX, p.       120; also _Times and Seasons_, vol. III, p. 709.) As stated       elsewhere, the Articles have been formally adopted by the Church       as an authorized summary of its principal doctrines.         =2. Joseph Smith's Early Persecution.=--The Prophet wrote as       follows concerning the persecution of his boyhood days, which       dated from the time of his first mention of his vision of the       Father and the Son:--\"It has often caused me serious reflection,       both then and since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy,       a little over fourteen years of age, and one too who was doomed       to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily       labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to       attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects       of the day, so as to create in them a spirit of the hottest       persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and was       often cause of great sorrow to myself. However, it was,       nevertheless, a fact that I had had a vision. I have thought       since that I felt much like Paul when he made his defense before       King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when       he saw a light and heard a voice, but still there were but a few       who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was       mad, and he was ridiculed and reviled; but all this did not       destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew       he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it       otherwise; ... So it was with me; I had actually seen a light,       and in the midst of that light I saw two personages, and they did       in reality speak unto me, or one of them did; and though I was       hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it       was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and       speaking all manner of evil against me, falsely, for so saying, I       was led to say in my heart, Why persecute for telling the truth?       I had actually seen a vision, and who am I that I can withstand       God?\" _Pearl of Great Price_:--Extracts from the History of       Joseph Smith: 23-25.         =3. Tribute to Joseph Smith.=--While few people outside the       Church have had much to say in commendation of this modern       prophet, it is interesting to note that there are some honorable       exceptions to the rule. Josiah Quincy, a prominent American, made       the acquaintance of Joseph Smith a short time before the latter's       martyrdom; and after the tragic event he wrote: \"It is by no       means improbable that some future text-book, for the use of       generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like       this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has       exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his       countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to       that interrogatory may be thus written: _Joseph Smith, the Mormon       Prophet_. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men       now, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. History       deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The       man who establishes a religion in this age of free debate, who       was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct       emissary from the Most High,--such a rare human being is not to       be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets....       The most vital questions Americans are asking each other today       have to do with this man and what he has left us.... Burning       questions they are, which must give a prominent place in the       history of the country to that sturdy self-asserter whom I       visited at Nauvoo, Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired       teacher, faced adversity, such as few men have been called to       meet, enjoyed a brief season of prosperity, such as few men have       ever attained, and, finally, forty-three days after I saw him,       went cheerfully to a martyr's death. When he surrendered his       person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the shedding of       blood, the Prophet had a presentiment of what was before him. 'I       am going like a lamb to the slaughter,' he is reported to have       said, 'but I am as calm as a summer's morning. I have a       conscience void of "]]]
