He had, however, gone to Heddington  to learn further news of the massacre. He was thinking of his Uncle  Benn-all else could wait. His anxiety was infinitely greater than  that of Luke Claridge, for his mind had been disturbed by frequent  premonitions; and those sudden calls in his sleep-his uncle's  voice--ever seemed to be waking him at night. He had not meant to speak  at the meeting, but the last words of the speaker decided him; he was  in a flame of indignation. He heard the voice of Faith whisper over the  heads of the people. \"David, David, do thee speak.\" Turning, he met her  eyes, then rose to his feet, came steadily to the platform, and raised a  finger towards the chairman.    A great whispering ran through the audience. Very many recognised  him, and all had heard of him--the history of his late banishment and  self-approving punishment were familiar to them. He climbed the steps  of the platform alertly, and the chairman welcomed him with nervous  pleasure. Any word from a Quaker, friendly to the feeling of national  indignation, would give the meeting the new direction which all desired.    Something in the face of the young man, grown thin and very pale during  the period of long thought and little food in the lonely and meditative  life he had led; something human and mysterious in the strange tale of  his one day's mad doings, fascinated them. They had heard of the liquor  he had drunk, of the woman he had kissed at the cross-roads, of the  man he had fought, of his discipline and sentence. His clean, shapely  figure, and the soft austerity of the neat grey suit he wore, his  broad-brimmed hat pushed a little back, showing well a square white  forehead--all conspired to send a wave of feeling through the audience,  which presently broke into cheering.    Beginning with the usual formality, he said: \"I am obliged to differ  from nearly every sentiment expressed by the Earl of Eglington, the  member for Levizes, who has just taken his seat.\"    There was an instant's pause, the audience cheered, and cries of delight  came from all parts of the house. \"All good counsel has its sting,\" he  continued, \"but the good counsel of him who has just spoken is a sting  in a wound deeper than the skin. The noble Earl has bidden us to be  consistent and reasonable. I have risen here to speak for that to which  mere consistency and reason may do cruel violence. I am a man of peace,  I am the enemy of war--it is my faith and creed; yet I repudiate the  principle put forward by the Earl of Eglington, that you shall not  clinch your hand for the cause which is your heart's cause, because, if  you smite, the smiting must be paid for.\"    He was interrupted by cheers and laughter, for the late event in his own  life came to them to point his argument.    \"The nation that declines war may be refusing to inflict that just  punishment which alone can set the wrong-doers on the better course. It  is not the faith of that Society to which I belong to decline correction  lest it may seem like war.\"    The point went home significantly, and cheering followed. \"The high  wall of Tibet, a stark refusal to open the door to the wayfarer, I can  understand; but, friend\"--he turned to the young peer--\"friend, I cannot  understand a defence of him who opens the door upon terms of mutual  hospitality, and then, in the red blood of him who has so contracted,  blots out the just terms upon which they have agreed. Is that thy faith,  friend?\"    The repetition of the word friend was almost like a gibe, though it was  not intended as such. There was none present, however, but knew of the  defection of the Earl's father from the Society of Friends, and they  chose to interpret the reference to a direct challenge. It was a  difficult moment for the young Earl, but he only smiled, and cherished  anger in his heart.    For some minutes David spoke with force and power, and he ended with  passionate solemnity. His voice rang out: \"The smoke of this burning  rises to Heaven, the winds that wail over scattered and homeless dust  bear a message of God to us. In the name of Mahomet, whose teaching  condemns treachery and murder, in the name of the Prince of Peace, who  taught that justice which makes for peace, I say it is England's duty  to lay the iron hand of punishment upon this evil city and on the  Government in whose orbit it shines with so deathly a light. I fear it  is that one of my family and of my humble village lies beaten to death  in Damascus. Yet not because of that do I raise my voice here to-day.  These many years Benn Claridge carried his life in his hands, and in  a good cause it was held like the song of a bird, to be blown from his  lips in the day of the Lord. I speak only as an Englishman. I ask you  to close your minds against the words of this brilliant politician, who  would have you settle a bill of costs written in Christian blood, by a  promise to pay, got through a mockery of armed display in those waters  on which once looked the eyes of the Captain of our faith. Humanity has  been put in the witness-box of the world; let humanity give evidence.\"    Women wept. Men waved their hats and cheered; the whole meeting rose to  its feet and gave vent to its feelings.    For some moments the tumult lasted, Eglington looking on with face  unmoved. As David turned to leave the table, however, he murmured,  \"Peacemaker! Peacemaker!\" and smiled sarcastically.    As the audience resumed their seats, two people were observed making  their way to the platform. One was Elder Fairley, leading the way to a  tall figure in a black robe covering another coloured robe, and wearing  a large white turban. Not seeing the new-comers, the chairman was about  to put the resolution; but a protesting hand from John Fairley stopped  him, and in a strange silence the two new-comers mounted the platform.  David rose and advanced to meet them. There flashed into his mind that  this stranger in Eastern garb was Ebn Ezra Bey, the old friend of Benn  Claridge, of whom his uncle had spoken and written so much. The same  instinct drew Ebn Ezra Bey to him--he saw the uncle's look in the  nephew's face. In a breathless stillness the Oriental said in perfect  English, with a voice monotonously musical:    \"I came to thy house and found thee not. I have a message for thee from  the land where thine uncle sojourned with me.\"    He took from a wallet a piece of paper and passed it to David, adding:  \"I was thine uncle's friend. He hath put off his sandals and walketh  with bare feet!\" David read eagerly.    \"It is time to go, Davy,\" the paper said. \"All that I have is thine. Go  to Egypt, and thee shall find it so. Ebn Ezra Bey will bring thee. Trust  him as I have done. He is a true man, though the Koran be his faith.  They took me from behind, Davy, so that I was spared temptation--I die  as I lived, a man of peace. It is too late to think how it might have  gone had we met face to face; but the will of God worketh not according  to our will. I can write no more. Luke, Faith, and Davy--dear Davy, the  night has come, and all's well. Good morrow, Davy. Can you not hear me  call? I have called thee so often of late! Good morrow! Good morrow!...  I doff my hat, Davy--at last--to God!\"    David's face whitened. All his visions had been true visions, his dreams  true dreams. Brave Benn Claridge had called to him at his door--\"Good  morrow! Good morrow! Good morrow!\" Had he not heard the knocking and the  voice? Now all was made clear. His path lay open before him--a far land  called him, his quiet past was infinite leagues away. Already the staff  was in his hands and the cross-roads were sinking into the distance  behind. He was dimly conscious of the wan, shocked face of Faith in the  crowd beneath him, which seemed blurred and swaying, of the bowed  head of Luke Claridge, who, standing up, had taken off his hat in the  presence of this news of his brother's death which he saw written in  David's face. David stood for a moment before the great throng, numb and  speechless. \"It is a message from Damascus,\" he said at last, and could  say no more.    Ebn Ezra Bey turned a grave face upon the audience.    \"Will you hear me?\" he said. \"I am an Arab.\" \"Speak--speak!\" came from  every side.    \"The Turk hath done his evil work in Damascus,\" he said. \"All the  Christians are dead--save one; he hath turned Muslim, and is safe.\" His  voice had a note of scorn. \"It fell sudden and swift like a storm in  summer. There were no paths to safety. Soldiers and those who led them  shared in the slaying. As he and I who had travelled far together these  many years sojourned there in the way of business, I felt the air grow  colder, I saw the cloud gathering. I entreated, but he would not go. If  trouble must come, then he would be with the Christians in their peril.  At last he saw with me the truth. He had a plan of escape. There was a  Christian weaver with his wife in a far quarter--against my entreaty he  went to warn them. The storm broke. He was the first to fall, smitten in  'that street called Straight.' I found him soon after. Thus did he speak  to me--even in these words: 'The blood of women and children shed  here to-day shall cry from the ground. Unprovoked the host has turned  wickedly upon his guest. The storm has been sown, and the whirlwind must  be reaped. Out of this evil good shall come. Shall not the Judge of all  the earth do right?' These were his last words to me then. As his life  ebbed out, he wrote a letter which I have brought hither to one\"--he  turned to David--\"whom he loved. At the last he took off his hat, and  lay with it in his hands, and died.... I am a Muslim, but the God of  pity, of justice, and of right is my God; and in His name be it said  that was a crime of Sheitan the accursed.\"    In a low voice the chairman put the resolution. The Earl of Eglington  voted in its favour.    Walking the hills homeward with Ebn Ezra"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#7)"],[1,"could see two sides of a  thing was born. The wonderful synthesis so familiar in nature; the  upper and the under side of the medal of Jove; the union of  impossibilities, which reappears in every object; its real and its  ideal power,--was now, also, transferred entire to the consciousness  of a man.    The balanced soul came. If he loved abstract truth, he saved himself  by propounding the most popular of all principles, the absolute good,  which rules rulers, and judges the judge. If he made transcendental  distinctions, he fortified himself by drawing all his illustrations  from sources disdained by orators, and polite conversers; from mares  and puppies; from pitchers and soup-ladles; from cooks and criers;  the shops of potters, horse-doctors, butchers, and fishmongers. He  cannot forgive in himself a partiality, but is resolved that the two  poles of thought shall appear in his statement. His arguments and his  sentences are self-poised and spherical. The two poles appear; yes,  and become two hands, to grasp and appropriate their own.    Every great artist has been such by synthesis. Our strength is  transitional, alternating; or, shall I say, a thread of two strands.  The seashore, sea seen from shore, shore seen from sea; the taste of  two metals in contact; and our enlarged powers at the approach and at  the departure of a friend; the experience of poetic creativeness, which  is not found in staying at home, nor yet in traveling, but in  transitions from one to the other, which must therefore be adroitly  managed to present as much transitional surface as possible; this  command of two elements must explain the power and charm of Plato. Art  expresses the one, or the same by the different. Thought seeks to know  unity in unity; poetry to show it by variety; that is, always by an  object or symbol. Plato keeps the two vases, one of aether and one of  pigment, at his side, and invariably uses both. Things added to things,  as statistics, civil history, are inventories. Things used as language  are inexhaustibly attractive. Plato turns incessantly the obverse and  the reverse of the medal of Jove.    To take an example:--The physical philosophers have sketched each his  theory of the world; the theory of atoms, of fire, of flux, of spirit;  theories mechanical and chemical in their genius. Plato, a master of  mathematics, studious of all natural laws and causes, feels these, as  second causes, to be no theories of the world, but bare inventories  and lists. To the study of nature he therefore prefixes the dogma,--\"Let  us declare the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and  compose the universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of  envy. Exempt from envy, he wished that all things should be as much  as possible like himself. Whosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit  this as the prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world,  will be in the truth.\" \"All things are for the sake of the good, and  it is the cause of everything beautiful.\" This dogma animates and  impersonates his philosophy. The synthesis which makes the character  of his mind appears in all his talents. Where there is great compass  of wit, we usually find excellencies that combine easily in the living  man, but in description appear incompatible. The mind of Plato is not  to be exhibited by a Chinese catalogue, but is to be apprehended by  an original mind in the exercise of its original power. In him the  freest abandonment is united with the precision of a geometer. His  daring imagination gives him the more solid grasp of facts; as the  birds of highest flight have the strongest alar bones. His patrician  polish, his intrinsic elegance, edged by an irony so subtle that it  stings and paralyzes, adorn the soundest health and strength of frame.  According to the old sentence, \"If Jove should descend to the earth,  he would speak in the style of Plato.\"    With this palatial air, there is, for the direct aim of several of his  works, and running through the tenor of them all, a certain earnestness,  which mounts, in the Republic, and in the Phaedo, to piety. He has  been charged with feigning sickness at the time of the death of  Socrates. But the anecdotes that have come down from the times attest  his manly interference before the people in his master's behalf, since  even the savage cry of the assembly to Plato is preserved; and the  indignation towards popular government, in many of his pieces, expresses  a personal exasperation. He has a probity, a native reverence for  justice and honor, and a humanity which makes him tender for the  superstitions of the people. Add to this, he believes that poetry,  prophecy, and the high insight, arc from a wisdom of which man is not  master; that the gods never philosophize; but, by a celestial mania,  these miracles are accomplished. Horsed on these winged steeds, he  sweeps the dim regions, visits worlds which flesh cannot enter; he saw  the souls in pain; he hears the doom of the judge; he beholds the penal  metempsychosis; the Fates, with the rock and shears; and hears the  intoxicating hum of their spindle.    But his circumspection never forsook him. One would say, he had read  the inscription on the gates of Busyrane,--\"Be bold;\" and on the second  gate,--\"Be bold, be bold and evermore be bold;\" and then again he  paused well at the third gate,--\"Be not too bold.\" His strength is  like the momentum of a falling planet; and his discretion, the return  of its due and perfect curve,--so excellent is his Greek love of  boundary, and his skill in definition. In reading logarithms, one is  not more secure, than in following Plato in his flights. Nothing can  be colder than his head, when the lightnings of his imagination are  playing in the sky. He has finished his thinking, before he brings it  to the reader; and he abounds in the surprises of a literary master.  He has that opulence which furnishes, at every turn, the precise weapon  he needs. As the rich man wears no more garments, drives no more horses,  sits in no more chambers, than the poor,--but has that one dress, or  equipage, or instrument, which is fit for the hour and the need; so  Plato, in his plenty, is never restricted, but has the fit word. There  is, indeed, no weapon in all the armory of wit which he did not possess  and use,--epic, analysis, mania, intuition, music, satire, and irony,  down to the customary and polite. His illustrations are poetry and his  jests illustrations. Socrates' profession of obstetric art is good  philosophy; and his finding that word \"cookery,\" and \"adulatory art,\"  for rhetoric, in the Gorgias, does us a substantial service still. No  orator can measure in effect with him who can give good nicknames.    What moderation, and understatement, and checking his thunder in mid  volley! He has good-naturedly furnished the courtier and citizen with  all that can be said against the schools. \"For philosophy is an elegant  thing, if any one modestly meddles with it; but, if he is conversant  with it more than is becoming, it corrupts the man.\" He could well  afford to be generous,--he, who from the sunlike centrality and reach  of his vision, had a faith without cloud. Such as his perception, was  his speech: he plays with the doubt, and makes the most of it: he  paints and quibbles; and by and by comes a sentence that moves the sea  and land. The admirable earnest comes not only at intervals, in the  perfect yes and no of the dialogue, but in bursts of light. \"I,  therefore, Callicles, am persuaded by these accounts, and consider how  I may exhibit my soul before the judge in a healthy condition.  Wherefore, disregarding the honors that most men value, and looking  to the truth, I shall endeavor in reality to live as virtuously as I  can and, when I die, to die so. And I invite all other men, to the  utmost of my power; and you, too, I in turn invite to this contest,  which, I affirm, surpasses all contests here.\"    He is a great average man one who, to the best thinking, adds a  proportion and equality in his faculties, so that men see in him their  own dreams and glimpses made available, and made to pass for what they  are. A great common sense is his warrant and qualification to be the  world's interpreter. He has reason, as all the philosophic and poetic  class have: but he has, also, what they have not,--this strong solving  sense to reconcile his poetry with the appearances of the world, and  build a bridge from the streets of cities to the Atlantis. He omits  never this graduation, but slopes his thought, however picturesque the  precipice on one side, to an access from the plain. He never writes  in ecstasy, or catches us up into poetic rapture.    Plato apprehended the cardinal facts. He could prostrate himself on  the earth, and cover his eyes, whilst he adorned that which cannot be  numbered, or gauged, or known, or named: that of which everything can  be affirmed and denied: that \"which is entity and nonentity.\" He called  it super-essential. He even stood ready, as in the Parmenides, to  demonstrate that it was so,--that this Being exceeded the limits of  intellect. No man ever more fully acknowledged the Ineffable. Having  paid his homage, as for the human race, to the Illimitable, he then  stood erect, and for the human race affirmed, \"And yet things are  knowable!\"--that is, the Asia in his mind was first heartily  honored,--the ocean of love and power, before form, before will, before  knowledge, the Same, the Good, the One; and now, refreshed and empowered  by this worship, the instinct of Europe, namely, culture, returns; and  he cries, Yet things are knowable! They are knowable, because, being  from one, things correspond. There is a scale: and the correspondence  of heaven to earth, of matter to mind, of the part to the whole, is  our guide. As there is a science of stars, called astronomy; a science  of quantities called mathematics; a science of "]]]
