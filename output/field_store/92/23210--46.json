The  governors who reside at Angostura have struggled against them with  very unequal success, according as the ministry of Madrid showed a  complaisant deference for the ecclesiastical hierarchy, or sought to  limit its power. In 1768 Don Manuel Centurion carried off twenty  thousand head of cattle from the missionaries, in order to distribute  them among the indigent inhabitants. This liberality, exerted in a  manner not very legal, produced very serious consequences. The  governor was disgraced on the complaint of the Catalonian monks though  he had considerably extended the territory of the missions toward the  south, and founded the Villa de Barceloneta, above the confluence of  the Carony with the Rio Paragua, and the Ciudad de Guirior, near the  union of the Rio Paragua and the Paraguamusi. From that period the  civil administration has carefully avoided all intervention in the  affairs of the Capuchins, whose opulence has been exaggerated like  that of the Jesuits of Paraguay.    The missions of the Carony, by the configuration of their soil* and  the mixture of savannahs and arable lands, unite the advantages of the  Llanos of Calabozo and the valleys of Aragua. (* It appears that the  little table-lands between the mountains of Upata, Cumanu, and  Tupuquen, are more than one hundred and fifty toises above the level  of the sea.) The real wealth of this country is founded on the care of  the herds and the cultivation of colonial produce. It were to be  wished that here, as in the fine and fertile province of Venezuela,  the inhabitants, faithful to the labours of the fields, would not  addict themselves too hastily to the research of mines. The example of  Germany and Mexico proves, no doubt, that the working of metals is not  at all incompatible with a flourishing state of agriculture; but,  according to popular traditions, the banks of the Carony lead to the  lake Dorado and the palace of the gilded man* (* El Dorado, that is,  el rey o hombre dorado. See volume 2.23.): and this lake, and this  palace, being a local fable, it might be dangerous to awaken  remembrances which begin gradually to be effaced. I was assured that  in 1760, the independent Caribs went to Cerro de Pajarcima, a mountain  to the south of Vieja Guayana, to submit the decomposed rock to the  action of washing. The gold-dust collected by this labour was put into  calabashes of the Crescentia cujete and sold to the Dutch at  Essequibo. Still more recently, some Mexican miners, who abused the  credulity of Don Jose Avalo, the intendant of Caracas, undertook a  very considerable work in the centre of the missions of the Rio  Carony, near the town of Upata, in the Cerros del Potrero and de  Chirica. They declared that the whole rock was auriferous;  stamping-mills, brocards, and smelting-furnaces were constructed.  After having expended very large sums, it was discovered that the  pyrites contained no trace whatever of gold. These essays, though  fruitless, served to renew the ancient idea that every shining rock in  Guiana is teeming with gold (una madre del oro). Not contented with  taking the mica-slate to the furnace, strata of amphibolic slates were  shown to me near Angostura, without any mixture of heterogeneous  substances, which had been worked under the whimsical name of black  ore of gold (oro negro).    This is the place to make known, in order to complete the description  of the Orinoco, the principal results of my researches on El Dorado,  the White Sea, or Laguna Parime, and the sources of the Orinoco, as  they are marked in the most recent maps. The idea of an auriferous  earth, eminently rich, has been connected, ever since the end of the  sixteenth century, with that of a great inland lake, which furnishes  at the same time waters to the Orinoco, the Rio Branco and the Rio  Essequibo. I believe, from a more accurate knowledge of the country, a  long and laborious study of the Spanish authors who treat of El  Dorado, and, above all, from comparing a great number of ancient maps,  arranged in chronological order, I have succeeded in discovering the  source of these errors. All fables have some real foundation; that of  El Dorado resembles those myths of antiquity, which, travelling from  country to country, have been successively adapted to different  localities. In the sciences, in order to distinguish truth from error,  it often suffices to retrace the history of opinions, and to follow  their successive developments. The discussion to which I shall devote  the end of this chapter is important, not only because it throws light  on the events of the Conquest, and that long series of disastrous  expeditions made in search of El Dorado, the last of which was in the  year 1775; it also furnishes, in addition to this simply historical  interest, another, more substantial and more generally felt, that of  rectifying the geography of South America, and of disembarrassing the  maps published in our days of those great lakes, and that strange  labyrinth of rivers, placed as if by chance between sixty and  sixty-six degrees of longitude. No man in Europe believes any longer  in the wealth of Guiana and the empire of the Grand Patiti. The town  of Manoa and its palaces covered with plates of massy gold have long  since disappeared; but the geographical apparatus serving to adorn the  fable of El Dorado, the lake Parima, which, similar to the lake of  Mexico, reflected the image of so many sumptuous edifices, has been  religiously preserved by geographers. In the space of three centuries,  the same traditions have been differently modified; from ignorance of  the American languages, rivers have been taken for lakes, and portages  for branches of rivers; one lake, the Cassipa, has been made to  advance five degrees of latitude toward the south, while another, the  Parima or Dorado, has been transported the distance of a hundred  leagues from the western to the eastern bank of the Rio Branco. From  these various changes, the problem we are going to solve has become  much more complicated than is generally supposed. The number of  geographers who discuss the basis of a map, with regard to the three  points of measures, of the comparison of descriptive works, and of the  etymological study* of names, is extremely small. (* I use this  expression, perhaps an improper one, to mark a species of philological  examination, to which the names of rivers, lakes, mountains, and  tribes, must be subjected, in order to discover their identity in a  great number of maps. The apparent diversity of names arises partly  from the difference of the dialects spoken by one and the same family  of people, partly from the imperfection of our European orthography,  and from the extreme negligence with which geographers copy one  another. We recognize with difficulty the Rio Uaupe in the Guaupe or  Guape; the Xie, in the Guaicia; the Raudal de Atures, in Athule; the  Caribbees, in the Calinas and Galibis; the Guaraunos or Uarau, in the  Oaraw-its; etc. It is, however, by similar mutations of letters, that  the Spaniards have made hijo of filius; hambre, of fames; and Felipo  de Urre, and even Utre, of the Conquistador Philip von Huten; that the  Tamanacs in America have substituted choraro for soldado; and the Jews  in China, Ialemeiohang for Jeremiah. Analogy and a certain  etymological tact must guide geographers in researches of this kind,  in which they would be exposed to serious errors, if they were not to  study at the same time the respective situations of the upper and  lower tributary streams of the same river. Our maps of America are  overloaded with names, for which rivers have been created. This desire  of compiling, of filling up vacancies, and of employing, without  investigation, heterogeneous materials, has given our maps of  countries the least visited an appearance of exactness, the falsity of  which is discovered when we arrive on the spot.) Almost all the maps  of South America which have appeared since the year 1775 are, in what  regards the interior of the country, comprised between the steppes of  Venezuela and the river of the Amazons, between the eastern back of  the Andes and the coast of Cayenne, a simple copy of the great Spanish  map of La Cruz Olmedilla. A line, indicating the extent of country  which Don Jose Solano boasted of having discovered and pacified by his  troops and emissaries, was taken for the road followed by that  officer, who never went beyond San Fernando de Atabapo, a village one  hundred and sixty leagues distant from the pretended lake Parima. The  study of the work of Father Caulin, who was the historiographer of the  expedition of Solano, and who states very clearly, from the testimony  of the Indians, how the name of the river Parima gave rise to the  fable of El Dorado, and of an inland sea, has been neglected. No use  either has been made of a map of the Orinoco, three years posterior to  that of La Cruz, and traced by Surville from the collection of true or  hypothetical materials preserved in the archives of the Despacho  universal de Indias. The progress of geography, as manifested on our  maps, is much slower than might be supposed from the number of useful  results which are found scattered in the works of different nations.  Astronomical observations and topographic information accumulate  during a long lapse of years, without being made use of; and from a  principle of stability and preservation, in other respects  praiseworthy, those who construct maps often choose rather to add  nothing, than to sacrifice a lake, a chain of mountains, or an  interbranching of rivers, which have figured there during ages.    The fabulous traditions of El Dorado and the lake Parima having been  diversely modified according to the aspect of the countries to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#7)"],[1,"texts which speak of Brahman as  cause, Brahman must be taken as being 'without a second', i.e. without  any other being of the same or a different kind; and the text which aims  at defining Brahman has then to be interpreted in accordance with this  characteristic of Brahman, viz. its being without a second. The  statement of the Chândogya as to Brahman being without a second must  also be taken to imply that Brahman is non-dual as far as qualities are  concerned; otherwise it would conflict with those passages which speak  of Brahman as being without qualities and without stain. We therefore  conclude that the defining Taittirîya-text teaches Brahman to be an  absolutely homogeneous substance.    But, the above explanation of the passage being accepted, it follows  that the words 'true being,' 'knowledge,' &c., have to be viewed as  abandoning their direct sense, and merely suggesting a thing distinct in  nature from all that is opposite (to what the three words directly  denote), and this means that we resort to so-called implication (implied  meaning, lakshanâ)!--What objection is there to such a proceeding? we  reply. The force of the general purport of a sentence is greater than  that of the direct denotative power of the simple terms, and it is  generally admitted that the purport of grammatical co-ordination is  oneness (of the matter denoted by the terms co-ordinated).--But we never  observe that all words of a sentence are to be understood in an implied  sense!--Is it then not observed, we reply, that _one_ word is to be  taken in its implied meaning if otherwise it would contradict the  purport of the whole sentence? And if the purport of the sentence, which  is nothing but an aggregate of words employed together, has once been  ascertained, why should we not take two or three or all words in an  implied sense--just as we had taken one--and thus make them fit in with  the general purport? In agreement herewith those scholars who explain to  us the sense of imperative sentences, teach that in imperative sentences  belonging to ordinary speech all words have an implied meaning only (not  their directly denotative meaning). For, they maintain, imperative forms  have their primary meaning only in (Vedic) sentences which enjoin  something not established by other means; and hence in ordinary speech  the effect of the action is conveyed by implication only. The other  words also, which form part of those imperative sentences and denote  matters connected with the action, have their primary meaning only if  connected with an action not established by other means; while if  connected with an ordinary action they have a secondary, implied,  meaning only [FOOTNOTE 30:1]. Perception reveals to us non-differenced  substance only    We have so far shown that in the case of a conflict between Scripture  and Perception and the other instruments of knowledge, Scripture is of  greater force. The fact, however, is that no such conflict is observed  to exist, since Perception itself gives rise to the apprehension of a  non-differenced Brahman whose nature is pure Being.--But how can it be  said that Perception, which has for its object things of various kinds--  and accordingly expresses itself in judgments such as 'Here is a jar,'  'There is a piece of cloth'--causes the apprehension of mere Being? If  there were no apprehension of difference, all cognitions would have one  and the same object, and therefore would give rise to one judgment only--  as takes place when one unbroken perceptional cognition is continued for  some time.--True. We therefore have to enquire in what way, in the  judgment 'here is a jar,' an assertion is made about being as well as  some special form of being. These implied judgments cannot both be  founded on perception, for they are the results of acts of cognition  occupying different moments of time, while the perceptional cognition  takes place in one moment (is instantaneous). We therefore must decide  whether it is the essential nature of the jar, or its difference from  other things, that is the object of perception. And we must adopt the  former alternative, because the apprehension of difference presupposes  the apprehension of the essential nature of the thing, and, in addition,  the remembrance of its counterentities (i.e. the things from which the  given thing differs). Hence difference is not apprehended by Perception;  and all judgments and propositions relative to difference are founded on  error only.    Difference--bheda--does not admit of logical definition    The Logicians, moreover, are unable to give a definition of such a thing  as 'difference.' Difference cannot in the first place be the essential  nature (of that which differs); for from that it would follow that on  the apprehension of the essential nature of a thing there would at once  arise not only the judgment as to that essential nature but also  judgments as to its difference from everything else.--But, it may be  objected to this, even when the essential nature of a thing is  apprehended, the judgment 'this thing is different from other things'  depends on the remembrance of its counterentities, and as long as this  remembrance does not take place so long the judgment of difference is  not formed!--Such reasoning, we reply, is inadmissible. He who maintains  that 'difference' is nothing but 'essential nature' has no right to  assume a dependence on counterentities since, according to him,  essential nature and difference are the same, i.e. nothing but essential  nature: the judgment of difference can, on his view, depend on  counterentities no more than the judgment of essential nature does. His  view really implies that the two words 'the jar' and 'different' (in the  judgment 'the jar is different') are synonymous, just as the words  'hasta' and 'kara' are (both of which mean 'hand').    Nor, in the second place, can 'difference' be held to be an attribute  (dharma). For if it were that, we should have to assume that  'difference' possesses difference (i.e. is different) from essential  nature; for otherwise it would be the same as the latter. And this  latter difference would have to be viewed as an attribute of the first  difference, and this would lead us on to a third difference, and so in  infinitum. And the view of 'difference' being an attribute would further  imply that difference is apprehended on the apprehension of a thing  distinguished by attributes such as generic character and so on, and at  the same time that the thing thus distinguished is apprehended on the  apprehension of difference; and this would constitute a logical seesaw.--  'Difference' thus showing itself incapable of logical definition, we are  confirmed in our view that perception reveals mere 'Being' only.    Moreover, it appears that in states of consciousness such as 'Here is a  jar,' 'There is a piece of cloth,' 'The jar is perceived,' 'The piece of  cloth is perceived,' that which constitutes the things is Being  (existence; sattâ) and perception (or 'consciousness'; anubhûti). And we  observe that it is pure Being only which persists in all states of  cognition: this pure Being alone, therefore, is _real_. The differences,  on the other hand, which do not persist, are unreal. The case is  analogous to that of the snake-rope. The rope which persists as a  substrate is real, while the non-continuous things (which by wrong  imagination are superimposed on the rope) such as a snake, a cleft in  the ground, a watercourse, and so on, are unreal.    But--our adversary objects--the instance is not truly analogous. In the  case of the snake-rope the non-reality of the snake results from the  snake's being sublated (bâdhita) by the cognition of the true nature of  the substrate 'This is a rope, not a snake'; it does not result from the  non-continuousness of the snake. In the same way the reality of the rope  does not follow from its persistence, but from the fact of its being not  sublated (by another cognition). But what, we ask, establishes the  non-reality of jars and pieces of cloth?--All are agreed, we reply, that  we observe, in jars and similar things, individual difference  (vyâvritti, literally 'separation,' 'distinction'). The point to decide  is of what nature such difference is. Does it not mean that the judgment  'This is a jar' implies the negation of pieces of cloth and other  things? But this means that by this judgment pieces of cloth and other  things are sublated (bâdhita). Individual difference (vyâvritti) thus  means the cessation (or absence), due to sublation, of certain objects  of cognition, and it proves the non-reality of whatever has  non-continuous existence; while on the other hand, pure Being, like the  rope, persists non-sublated. Hence everything that is additional to pure  Being is non-real.--This admits of being expressed in technical form.  'Being' is real because it persists, as proved by the case of the rope  in the snake-rope; jars and similar things are non-real because they are  non-continuous, as proved by the case of the snake that has the rope for  its substrate.    From all this it follows that persisting consciousness only has real  being; it alone is.    Being and consciousness are one. Consciousness is svayamprakâsa.    But, our adversary objects, as mere Being is the object of consciousness,  it is different therefrom (and thus there exists after all 'difference'  or 'plurality').--Not so, we reply. That there is no such thing as  'difference,' we have already shown above on the grounds that it is not  the object of perception, and moreover incapable of definition. It  cannot therefore be proved that 'Being' is the object of consciousness.  Hence Consciousness itself is 'Being'--that which is.--This  consciousness is self-proved, just because it is consciousness. Were it  proved through something else, it would follow that like jars and  similar things it is not consciousness."]]]
