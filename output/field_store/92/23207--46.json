(#7)"],[1," her ladies in waiting:  namely, Miss Angela Bohun, and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains,  the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star  in her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a  slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side--a couple  of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw.  Also among  the missing were several mere baronesses--and I wanted them to  stay missing; but no, all that sausage-meat had to be found; so  servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills  to that end.    Of course, the whole drove was housed in the house, and, great  guns!--well, I never saw anything like it.  Nor ever heard anything  like it.  And never smelt anything like it.  It was like an  insurrection in a gasometer.        CHAPTER XXI    THE PILGRIMS    When I did get to bed at last I was unspeakably tired; the stretching  out, and the relaxing of the long-tense muscles, how luxurious,  how delicious! but that was as far as I could get--sleep was out of  the question for the present.  The ripping and tearing and squealing  of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium  come again, and kept me broad awake.  Being awake, my thoughts  were busy, of course; and mainly they busied themselves with Sandy's  curious delusion.  Here she was, as sane a person as the kingdom  could produce; and yet, from my point of view she was acting like  a crazy woman.  My land, the power of training! of influence!  of education!  It can bring a body up to believe anything.  I had  to put myself in Sandy's place to realize that she was not a  lunatic.  Yes, and put her in mine, to demonstrate how easy it is  to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have  been taught.  If I had told Sandy I had seen a wagon, uninfluenced  by enchantment, spin along fifty miles an hour; had seen a man,  unequipped with magic powers, get into a basket and soar out of  sight among the clouds; and had listened, without any necromancer's  help, to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles  away, Sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy, she  would have thought she knew it.  Everybody around her believed in  enchantments; nobody had any doubts; to doubt that a castle could  be turned into a sty, and its occupants into hogs, would have been  the same as my doubting among Connecticut people the actuality  of the telephone and its wonders,--and in both cases would be  absolute proof of a diseased mind, an unsettled reason.  Yes, Sandy  was sane; that must be admitted.  If I also would be sane--to Sandy  --I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous  locomotives, balloons, and telephones, to myself.  Also, I believed  that the world was not flat, and hadn't pillars under it to support  it, nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that  occupied all space above; but as I was the only person in the kingdom  afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions, I recognized  that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter, too,  if I did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody  as a madman.    The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining-room and  gave them their breakfast, waiting upon them personally and  manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of  her island, ancient and modern, have always felt for rank, let its  outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may.  I could have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my  lofty official rank; but I hadn't, and so accepted the unavoidable  slight and made no complaint.  Sandy and I had our breakfast at  the second table.  The family were not at home.  I said:    \"How many are in the family, Sandy, and where do they keep themselves?\"    \"Family?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Which family, good my lord?\"    \"Why, this family; your own family.\"    \"Sooth to say, I understand you not.  I have no family.\"    \"No family?  Why, Sandy, isn't this your home?\"    \"Now how indeed might that be?  I have no home.\"    \"Well, then, whose house is this?\"    \"Ah, wit you well I would tell you an I knew myself.\"    \"Come--you don't even know these people?  Then who invited us here?\"    \"None invited us.  We but came; that is all.\"    \"Why, woman, this is a most extraordinary performance.  The  effrontery of it is beyond admiration.  We blandly march into  a man's house, and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility  the sun has yet discovered in the earth, and then it turns out  that we don't even know the man's name.  How did you ever venture  to take this extravagant liberty?  I supposed, of course, it was  your home.  What will the man say?\"    \"What will he say?  Forsooth what can he say but give thanks?\"    \"Thanks for what?\"    Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise:    \"Verily, thou troublest mine understanding with strange words.  Do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice  in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace  his house withal?\"    \"Well, no--when you come to that.  No, it's an even bet that this  is the first time he has had a treat like this.\"    \"Then let him be thankful, and manifest the same by grateful speech  and due humility; he were a dog, else, and the heir and ancestor  of dogs.\"    To my mind, the situation was uncomfortable.  It might become more so.  It might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on.  So I said:    \"The day is wasting, Sandy.  It is time to get the nobility together  and be moving.\"    \"Wherefore, fair sir and Boss?\"    \"We want to take them to their home, don't we?\"    \"La, but list to him!  They be of all the regions of the earth!  Each must hie to her own home; wend you we might do all these  journeys in one so brief life as He hath appointed that created  life, and thereto death likewise with help of Adam, who by sin  done through persuasion of his helpmeet, she being wrought upon  and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man, that  serpent hight Satan, aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that  evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart  through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst  so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes  its brethren-born in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein  all such as native be to that rich estate and--\"    \"Great Scott!\"    \"My lord?\"    \"Well, you know we haven't got time for this sort of thing.  Don't  you see, we could distribute these people around the earth in less  time than it is going to take you to explain that we can't.  We  mustn't talk now, we must act.  You want to be careful; you mustn't  let your mill get the start of you that way, at a time like this.  To business now--and sharp's the word.  Who is to take the  aristocracy home?\"    \"Even their friends.  These will come for them from the far parts  of the earth.\"    This was lightning from a clear sky, for unexpectedness; and the  relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner.  She would remain to  deliver the goods, of course.    \"Well, then, Sandy, as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully  ended, I will go home and report; and if ever another one--\"    \"I also am ready; I will go with thee.\"    This was recalling the pardon.    \"How?  You will go with me?  Why should you?\"    \"Will I be traitor to my knight, dost think?  That were dishonor.  I may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field  some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me.  I were to blame an I thought that that might ever hap.\"    \"Elected for the long term,\" I sighed to myself.  \"I may as well  make the best of it.\"  So then I spoke up and said:    \"All right; let us make a start.\"    While she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork, I gave that  whole peerage away to the servants.  And I asked them to take  a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly  lodged and promenaded; but they considered that that would be  hardly worth while, and would moreover be a rather grave departure  from custom, and therefore likely to make talk.  A departure from  custom--that settled it; it was a nation capable of committing any  crime but that.  The servants said they would follow the fashion,  a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance; they would  scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls, and then the  evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible.  It was a kind of satire on Nature: it was the scientific method,  the geologic method; it deposited the history of the family in  a stratified record; and the antiquary could dig through it and  tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family  had introduced successively for a hundred years.    The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims.  It was not going our way, but we joined it, nevertheless; for it  was hourly being borne in upon me now, that if I would govern  this country wisely, I must be posted in the details of its life,  and not at second hand, but by personal observation and scrutiny.    This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer's in this: that it  had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions  the country could show, and a corresponding variety of costume.  There were young men and old men, young women and old women,  lively folk and grave folk.  They rode upon mules and horses, and  there was not a side-saddle in the party; for this specialty was  to remain unknown in England for nine hundred years yet.    It was a pleasant, friendly, sociable herd; pious, happy, merry and  full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies.  What  they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused  no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best English  society twelve centuries later.

Finally, all princes of the blood should  have free choice; join that regiment, get that great title, and  renounce the royal grant, or stay out and receive a grant.  Neatest  touch of all: unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be  _born_ into the regiment, and start fair, with good wages and a  permanent situation, upon due notice from the parents.    All the boys would join, I was sure of that; so, all existing  grants would be relinquished; that the newly born would always  join was equally certain.  Within sixty days that quaint and  bizarre anomaly, the Royal Grant, would cease to be a living fact,  and take its place among the curiosities of the past.        CHAPTER XXVI    THE FIRST NEWSPAPER    When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman  to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life  of the people, he was all afire with the novelty of the thing  in a minute, and was bound to take a chance in the adventure  himself--nothing should stop him--he would drop everything and  go along--it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many  a day.  He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once;  but I showed him that that wouldn't answer.  You see, he was billed  for the king's-evil--to touch for it, I mean--and it wouldn't be  right to disappoint the house and it wouldn't make a delay worth  considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand.  And I thought  he ought to tell the queen he was going away.  He clouded up at  that and looked sad.  I was sorry I had spoken, especially when  he said mournfully:    \"Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here; and where Launcelot is,  she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth.\"    Of course, I changed the Subject.  Yes, Guenever was beautiful,  it is true, but take her all around she was pretty slack.  I never  meddled in these matters, they weren't my affair, but I did hate  to see the way things were going on, and I don't mind saying that  much.  Many's the time she had asked me, \"Sir Boss, hast seen  Sir Launcelot about?\" but if ever she went fretting around for  the king I didn't happen to be around at the time.    There was a very good lay-out for the king's-evil business--very  tidy and creditable.  The king sat under a canopy of state; about  him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals.  Conspicuous, both for location and personal outfit, stood Marinel,  a hermit of the quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick.  All  abroad over the spacious floor, and clear down to the doors,  in a thick jumble, lay or sat the scrofulous, under a strong light.  It was as good as a tableau; in fact, it had all the look of being  gotten up for that, though it wasn't.  There were eight hundred  sick people present.  The work was slow; it lacked the interest  of novelty for me, because I had seen the ceremonies before;  the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties required me  to stick it out.  The doctor was there for the reason that in all  such crowds there were many people who only imagined something  was the matter with them, and many who were consciously sound  but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, and  yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of  coin that went with the touch.  Up to this time this coin had been  a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar.  When you  consider how much that amount of money would buy, in that age  and country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead,  you would understand that the annual king's-evil appropriation was  just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it  took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the  surplus.  So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself  for the king's-evil.  I covered six-sevenths of the appropriation  into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my  adventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into  five-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk  of the King's Evil Department; a nickel to take the place of each  gold coin, you see, and do its work for it.  It might strain the  nickel some, but I judged it could stand it.  As a rule, I do not  approve of watering stock, but I considered it square enough  in this case, for it was just a gift, anyway.  Of course, you can  water a gift as much as you want to; and I generally do.  The old  gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown  origin, as a rule, but some of them were Roman; they were ill-shapen,  and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they  were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use that  the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked  like them.  I judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a  first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever  on the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out  of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous  fancy more; and I was right.  This batch was the first it was  tried on, and it worked to a charm.  The saving in expense was  a notable economy.  You will see that by these figures: We touched  a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would  have cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled  through for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop.  To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these  other figures: the annual expenses of a national government amount  to the equivalent of a contribution of three days' average wages of  every individual of the population, counting every individual as  if he were a man.  If you take a nation of 60,000,000, where average  wages are $2 per day, three days' wages taken from each individual  will provide $360,000,000 and pay the government's expenses.  In my  day, in my own country, this money was collected from imposts,  and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it, and it  made him comfortable to think so; whereas, in fact, it was paid  by the American people, and was so equally and exactly distributed  among them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and the  annual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was precisely  the same--each paid $6.  Nothing could be equaler than that,  I reckon.  Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur,  and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to  something less than 1,000,000.  A mechanic's average wage was  3 cents a day, when he paid his own keep.  By this rule the national  government's expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day.  Thus, by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king's-evil  day, I not only injured no one, dissatisfied no one, but pleased  all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day's national expense  into the bargain--a saving which would have been the equivalent  of $800,000 in my day in America.  In making this substitution  I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source--the wisdom  of my boyhood--for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom,  howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my boyhood I had always  saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary  cause.  The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as  the coin, the coin would answer me better than the buttons; all  hands were happy and nobody hurt.    Marinel took the patients as they came.  He examined the candidate;  if he couldn't qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passed  along to the king.  A priest pronounced the words, \"They shall  lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\"  Then the king  stroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, the  patient graduated and got his nickel--the king hanging it around  his neck himself--and was dismissed.  Would you think that that  would cure?  It certainly did.  Any mummery will cure if the  patient's faith is strong in it.  Up by Astolat there was a chapel  where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd  geese around there--the girl said so herself--and they built the  chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the  occurrence--a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick  person to approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lame  and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away  whole and sound; and even the well could look upon it and live.  Of course, when I was told these things I did not believe them;  but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb.  I saw the  cures effected myself; and they were real cures and not questionable.  I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches,  arrive and pray before that picture, and put down their crutches  and walk off without a limp.  There were piles of crutches there  which had been left by such people as a testimony.    In other places people operated on a patient's mind, without saying  a word to him, and cured him.  In others, experts assembled patients  in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and  those patients went away cured.  Wherever you find a king who can't  cure the king's-evil you can be sure that the most valuable  superstition that supports his throne--the subject's belief in  the divine appointment of his sovereign--has passed away.  In my  youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil,  but there was no occasion for this diffidence: they could have  cured it forty-nine times in fifty.    Well, when the priest had been droning for three hours, and the  good king polishing the evidences, and the sick were still pressing  forward as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored.  I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of"]]]
