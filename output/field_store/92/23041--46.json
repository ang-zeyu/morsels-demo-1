In a moment or two Lanti looked up.    'What ails thee, Beatrice?'    'I am not hungry.'    The word had scarcely left her lips before, leaping to his feet, and  sprawling across the table, he had snatched the untasted dish from under  her hands, turned, and dashed it with its contents full in the face of  Narcisso, who waited, with others, behind.  Fouled, bleeding,  half-stunned, the man crashed down in a heap, and in the same instant  his master was upon him, poniard in hand.    'Confess, wretch, before I kill thee!' he roared.  'It was meant for my  guest!  Thou wouldst have poisoned him.'    'Mercy!' shrieked the creature, through his filthy mask.  'O lord,  mercy!'    The girl, risen in her place, stood panting as if she had been running.  She had voice no more than to gasp across, 'Bernardo!  For the love of  God!  Bernardo!' and that was all.    'No mercy, beast!' thundered Carlo.  'Down with thee to hell unshriven!'    His strenuous lifted arm was caught in a baby grasp.    'Carlo! forbear!  The right is mine!  Give me the knife!  Nay, I am the  stronger!'    With the blood-lust halted in him for one moment, the powerful creature  turned upon his puny assailant with a roar:--    'The stronger!  Thou!'    Nevertheless he rose, though he held the reptile crushed under his foot,  while the company, landlord and all, stood huddled aghast.  His breast  was heaving like the pulse of a volcano.    'The knife!' he gurgled hoarsely; 'well, the right is thine, as thou  sayest.  Take it--under with thee, dog!--and drive in.'    Bembo seized and flung the dagger into the thick of the vines; then  threw himself on his knees, and, with all his strength, tore the heavy  foot from its victim.    'Narcisso,' he said, 'is it true? wouldst have slain Love!  Ah, fool,  not to know that Love is immortal!'    'Now, Christ in heaven,' roared Carlo, 'if that shall save him!'    Bernardo rose, and sprang, and cast himself upon his breast, writhing  his limbs about him.    'Fly!' he shrieked, 'fly! while I hold him!'  Then to Lanti: 'Ah, dear,  do not hurt me, who owe thee so much!'    The fallen scoundrel was quick to the opportunity. He rose and fled,  bloody and bemired, from the arbour. Madonna, seeing him escape, sunk,  with a fainting sigh, upon her bench.    Carlo mouthed after his vanishing prey; yet he was tender with his  burden.    'Love!' he groaned: 'Thou ow'st me?  Not this--so damned to folly!  There, let go.  He was but the tool--and, for the rest----'    He glowered round.    'Hush!' said Bembo.  'It is but the fruits of her teaching.  Blame not  thy pupil, Carlo.'    '_My_ pupil!'    'Is she Christ's--or art thou?  Love gives life, Carlo; and all life is  God's, since Christ redeemed it.'    'What then?'    'Why, is not thine honour thy life?'    'I would die at least to prove it.'    'Alas! and thou hast dishonoured love, which is life, which is God's.  Wouldst eat thy cake and have it, great schoolboy?'    'Pish!  Art beyond me.'    'Why, if love is life, and life is honour--ergo, love is honour.'    'Is it?  I dare say.'    'But thou must know it.'    'I know nothing but that thou hast balked my vengeance; and with that,  and having exercised thy jaw, let us go back to dinner.'    '_Domine, emitte tuam lucem!_' sighed Bembo.                                        *CHAPTER IV*      Galeazzo Maria Sforza, third Duke of Milan of his line, was very  characteristically engaged in a very characteristic room of his  resplendent castello of the Porta Giovia, which dominated the whole city  from the north-east.  This room, buried like a captivating lust in the  heart of the Rocca, or inner citadel of the castello, swarmed with those  deft procurers to the great, panders between Art and emotion, who are  satisfied, by contributing, each his share, to the glorification of a  sensual despotism, to partake a rediffused flavour of its sum.  They  were poets, painters, and musicians, sculptors and learned doctors, and  every one, despite his independent calling, a sycophant.  Before the  power, central and paramount, which alone in their particular orbit  could amass within itself the total of their lesser lights, they  prostrated themselves as before a God.  It is so in all ages of man.  He  will contribute, of choice, to the prosperous charity; he will lay his  gifts at the opulent shrine.  The worldling, says Shakespeare, makes his  testament of more to much.  '_Ah! c'est le plus grand roi du monde!_'  once cried Madame de Sevigne of Louis XIV., who had danced with her.  'He is the finest gentleman I have ever seen!' cried Johnson  enthusiastically at a later date, after an interview with Farmer George;  and though--perhaps because--the stout old Colossus was as independent  as reason itself, he spoke the general moral.  Professors were here,  too, who did not blush to proclaim the exalted scion of Condottieri, the  blood-lusting monster, the infernal atavism of Caligula, for the first  gentleman in Italy, or to prostitute their erudition in his service.    It was Madonna Beatrice who had drawn that analogy, and there was plenty  of justification for it; as also, it must be said, plenty of more  immediate precedent for the abominations of this Galeazzo.  If, like the  grand-matricidal Roman, he had poisoned his mother, the Visconti, his  predecessors, with their atrocious blood-profanations and exaltations of  bastardy, were responsible for the conditions which had made so dreadful  an act conceivable.  If, emulating Caligula's treatment of frail  vestals, he had buried alive some too-accommodating virgin of the  cloister, whom he had first debauched, he could quote the Visconti  precedent of carnality indulged till it became a very ecstasy of  fiend-possession.  Between old Rome and modern Milan, indeed, there was  little to prefer.  Caligula used to throw spectators in the theatres to  the beasts, having first torn out the tongues of his victims, lest his  ears should be offended by their articulate appeals.  Bernabo Visconti  and his brother, with whom he shared the duchy, agreed upon an edict  subjecting State criminals to a scale of tortures which was calculated  to culminate in death in not less than forty days. Giovanni Maria and  Filippo Maria, last of the accursed race, organised man-hunts in the  streets of their capitals, and fed their hounds on human flesh.    To starve his victims to death, and, when they complained (it was an age  of practical jokes), to stuff their mouths with filth, was a pet sport  with Galeazzo.  Once, for a wretch who had killed a hare, a crime  unpardonable, he procured a death of laughable, unspeakable torment by  forcing him to devour the animal, bones and fur and all.    It is enough.  They were all madmen, in fact, moral abortions of that  'breeding-in' of demi-gods which sows the world with chimeras.  It is  not good for any man to be subject to no government but his own, and  least of all when a vicious heredity has imposed a sickness on his  reason.  Blood affinities on the near side of incest, power  unquestioned, unbridled self-indulgences--these are no progenitors of  temperance and liberality.  Amongst savages, generations of  inter-marryings will but refine exquisitely on savagery; and the despots  of this era were little more than the last expressions of a decadent  barbarism.  Galeazzo, and such as Galeazzo, were, it is true, to project  the long shadows of their lusts and cruelties over the times  forthcoming; yet it is as certain that with him the limits of the worst  were reached, and hereafter peoples and rulers were to grow to some  common accord of participation in the enlightenments of their ages.    One might have fancied in him, in his apparent reachings to foreclose on  such a state, to appropriate to himself not its moral but its material  accessories, some uneasy premonition of the truth.  He stood on the line  of partition, his sympathies with the past, his greed for the opulent  future, and, hesitating, was presently to drop between.  That paradox of  the lusts of savagery and the lusts of intellect hobnobbing in the  individual, which characterised so many of his contemporaries, cried  aloud in him.  He was superstitious and a sceptic.  Like Malatesta of  Rimini--who could enshrine beneath the shadow of one glorious church the  bones of a favourite mistress and those of an admired heathen  philosopher which he had brought expressly from Greece for the  purpose--he would make a compromise between Paganism and Christianity.  He worshipped God and the devil, as if his arrogance halted at nothing  short of reconciling two equal but antagonistic powers.  He surrounded  himself with monks and infidels; acclaimed impartially an illuminated  psalter or a painting for a bagnio, a Roman canticle or a hymn to the  Paphian Venus; sobbed in the soft throbbings of a lute, and went sobbing  to witness a captive's torturing; conceived himself an enlightened  patron of the arts, and, in a mad caprice, ordered his craftsmen, under  penalty of instant death, to paint and hang with portraits of the ducal  family in a single night a hall of the castello.  He groped and  grovelled in bestiality; founded a library and peopled a university with  erudition; encouraged profligacy and printing; was covetous and lavish,  and splendid as the clusters of diamonds on a Jewess's unclean fingers.  His palaces swarmed with cutthroats and physicians, philosophers and  empirics, pimps and theologians, heaven-commissioned artists and  pope-commissioned agents for indulgences, who would sell one absolution  beforehand for the foulest excesses in lust or violence.  His crowded  halls were the very stage of the ante-renaissance, where the priest, the  poisoner, the romantic hero and the sordid villain, the flaunting doxy  and the white dove of innocence, rubbed shoulders with the scene-painter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],[0,"Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#7)"],[1,"Giovanni della Rovere           480                       Remission and rehabilitation of Duke                     Francesco Maria I.                           481                       Letter from Cardinal Wolsey to Lorenzo                     de' Medici                                   484          MEMOIRS OF THE DUKES OF URBINO--II      NOTE.--The Editor's notes are marked with an asterisk.          BOOK THIRD    (_continued_)    OF GUIDOBALDO DI MONTEFELTRO, THIRD DUKE OF URBINO          MEMOIRS OF THE DUKES OF URBINO          CHAPTER XIX         The massacre of Sinigaglia--Death of Alexander VI.--Narrow       escape of Cesare Borgia.      The principal object of the new combination having been attained  by the submission of Urbino, followed by that of Camerino, Borgia  hastened to anticipate the suspicions of his allies by sending  the French succours back to Milan. He however retained a body of  troops, and proposed that the chiefs should co-operate with him in  reducing Sinigaglia, which was held by the late Prefect's widow.  Accordingly, Paolo Orsini, his relation the Duke of Gravina,  Vitellozzo, and Liverotto advanced upon that town, the garrison of  which was commanded by the celebrated Andrea Doria. This remarkable  man, finding himself excluded by the state of parties at Genoa  from all prospect of preferment, had in youth adopted the career  of a condottiere. He took service with Giovanni della Rovere,  distinguishing himself greatly in the campaign of Charles VIII. at  Naples; after which he continued attached to the Prefect and his  widow, with a hundred light horse. Seeing the case of Sinigaglia  desperate, and dreading Liverotto's bitter hatred of the Rovere  race, he retired, having first sent off the Prefectess on horseback  to Florence, disguised as a friar. On the 28th of December, the  assailants took undisputed possession of the city, and sacked it.  His prey now in his toils, Valentino, who had lulled their suspicion  by keeping aloof with his troops in Romagna, flew to the spot on the  pretext of reducing the citadel, and on the 31st arrived at the town  with a handful of cavalry.    He was met three miles outside of the gate by the chiefs, and  immediately requested their attendance in the house of one Bernardino  di Parma, to receive his congratulations and thanks on their success.  At the same time he desired quarters to be provided for their  respective followings outside of the city, in order to admit his own  army, amounting to two thousand cavalry and ten thousand infantry.  Startled at the appearance of a force so disproportioned to the  service in hand, they would gladly have demurred to this distribution  of the troops, but Cesare had contrived that there should be no  opportunity for remonstrance, and resistance would have obviously  been too late. Affecting a confidence they were far from feeling, the  leaders accepted the invitation, and were received with cordiality  and distinction. After an interchange of compliments, Borgia withdrew  upon some pretext, when there immediately entered his chosen agent  of iniquity, Don Michelotto, with several armed followers, who,  after some resistance, arrested the Duke of Gravina, Paolo Orsini,  Vitellozzo, and Liverotto, with some ten others. Before morning the  two last were strangled with a Pisan cord, or violin-string, and a  wrench-pin, by the hands of that monster, in his master's presence.  Their death, according to Machiavelli, was cowardly, especially that  of the blood-stained Liverotto; and their bodies, after being dragged  round the piazza, were exposed for three days before burial.    That night Valentino, at the head of his Gascons, attacked six  thousand of these captains' troops, which had not dispersed on  hearing the capture of their leaders, slaughtering and plundering  them with the same barbarity they had themselves used towards the  citizens. The greater portion were cut to pieces, and those who  escaped reached their homes naked, having only straw tied round their  legs. Fabio Orsini was saved by his accidental absence from Borgia's  levee; Petrucci and Baglioni, suspicious of treachery, had avoided  their fate by previously retiring home. Against the last of these,  Borgia marched in a few days, carrying with him the remaining chiefs,  of whom he reserved the Orsini until he should hear his father's  intentions; but each night after supper he is said to have had one  of the others brought out, and put to a cruel death before him. Thus  did he, by a dexterous stroke of the most refined duplicity, turn the  tools of his ambition into victims of his vengeance, and at the same  time ridded himself of faithless adherents, whom any change in his  fortune would have again converted into overt and implacable foes.[1]    [Footnote 1: Our chief authorities for this tragic scene are  Machiavelli's despatches and separate narrative, with the Diaries of  Burchard, Buonaccorsi, and Sanuto. Some details are taken from the  Ricordi of Padre Gratio, guardian of the Monastery delle Grazie at  Sinigaglia, a contemporary, and probably an eye-witness to many of  them. Vat. Urb. MSS. 1023, art. 17.[*A]]    [Footnote *A: Cf. MADIAI, _Diario delle Cose di Urbino_,  in _Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_, tom. III., p. 437.  Machiavelli, who was with Cesare at the time, describes the massacre  of Sinigaglia as \"il bellissimo inganno di Sinigaglia.\" Cesare wrote  an account of it to Isabella d'Este. Cf. her letter to her husband  (D'ARCO, _Notizie di Isabella Estense_, in _Arch. St. Ital._, ser. i.,  App., vol. I., No. II. (1845), p. 262).]    Vermiglioli, in his life of Malatesta Baglioni, has printed, from  the archives of Perugia, a letter from Borgia to the magistrates of  that city, which, in consideration of the comparative obscurity of  that interesting volume, we shall here translate. It is, perhaps, the  only known document fully stating the case of the writer, and so may  be regarded as his defence from the charges we have brought against  him: the style and orthography are remarkably rude; and the matter  abounds in that common expedient, whereby bold and bad men seek to  evade merited accusations, by throwing them upon those they have  outraged.[2]    [Footnote 2: Our version is from the original letter. Nearly similar  in purport, but much shorter, is a despatch written by him to the  Doge of Venice on the very night of the raid, so anxious was he to  conciliate the Signory.]         \"Magnificent and potent Lords, my special Friends and       Brothers;         \"Superfluous were it to narrate from their outset the       perfidious rebellion and atrocious treason, so known to       yourselves and to all the world, and so detestable, which       your [lords, the Baglioni,] and their accomplices have       committed against his Holiness the Pope and ourselves.       And although all were our vassals, and most of them in       our pay, received and caressed by us as sons or brothers,       and favoured with high promotion, they nevertheless,       regardless of the kindness of his Holiness and our own,       as of their individual honour, banded in schemes of       overweening ambition, and blinded by greed of tyranny,       have failed us at the moment of our utmost need, turning       his Holiness' arms and ours against him and ourselves,       for the overthrow of our sovereignty and person. They       commenced their aggressions upon us by raising our       states of Urbino, Camerino, and Montefeltro, throwing       all Romagna into confusion by force and by seditious       plots, and proceeding under the mask of reconciliation to       fresh offences, until our new levies were brought up in       irresistible force. And so atrocious was their baseness,       that neither the beneficent clemency of his [Holiness]       aforesaid, nor our renewed indulgence to them, weaned them       from the slough of their first vile designs, in which       they still persisted. And as soon as they learned the       departure of the French troops on their return towards       Lombardy, whereby they deemed us weakened and left with no       effective force, they, feigning an urgent desire to aid       in our attack upon Sinigaglia, mustered a third only of       their infantry, and concealed the remainder in the houses       about, with instructions to draw together at nightfall,       and unite with the men-at-arms, whom they had posted in       the neighbourhood, meaning, at a given moment, to throw       the infantry, through the garrison (with whom they had an       understanding), upon the new town, in the narrow space       whereof they calculated upon our being lodged with few       attendants, and so to complete their long-nourished plans       by crushing us at unawares. But we, distinctly forewarned       of all, so effectively and quickly anticipated them, that       we at once made prisoners of the Duke of Gravina, Paolo       Orsini, Vitellozzo of Castello, and Liverotto of Fermo,       and discovered, sacked, and overthrew their foot and       horse, whether concealed or not; whereupon the castellan,       seeing the plot defeated, quickly surrendered the fortress       at discretion. And this we have done, under pressure       of necessity imposed by the measures of these persons       aforesaid, and in order to make an end of the unmeasured       perfidy and villanies of them and their coadjutors,       thereby restraining their boundless ambition and insensate       cupidity, which were truly a public nuisance to the nations       of Italy. Thus your highnesses have good cause for great       rejoicing at your deliverance from these dangers. And on       your highnesses' account, I am now, by his Holiness's       commands, to march with my army, for the purpose of       rescuing you from the rapacious and sanguinary oppression       whereby you have been vexed, and to restore you to free       and salutary"]]]
