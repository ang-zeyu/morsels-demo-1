[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#7)"],[1,"hand--rather large, but beautifully formed--was  given to me with the easy, unaffected self-reliance of a highly-bred  woman.  We sat down together at the breakfast-table in as cordial and  customary a manner as if we had known each other for years, and had met  at Limmeridge House to talk over old times by previous appointment.    \"I hope you come here good-humouredly determined to make the best of  your position,\" continued the lady.  \"You will have to begin this  morning by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine.  My  sister is in her own room, nursing that essentially feminine malady, a  slight headache; and her old governess, Mrs. Vesey, is charitably  attending on her with restorative tea.  My uncle, Mr. Fairlie, never  joins us at any of our meals: he is an invalid, and keeps bachelor  state in his own apartments.  There is nobody else in the house but me.  Two young ladies have been staying here, but they went away yesterday,  in despair; and no wonder.  All through their visit (in consequence of  Mr. Fairlie's invalid condition) we produced no such convenience in the  house as a flirtable, danceable, small-talkable creature of the male  sex; and the consequence was, we did nothing but quarrel, especially at  dinner-time.  How can you expect four women to dine together alone  every day, and not quarrel? We are such fools, we can't entertain each  other at table.  You see I don't think much of my own sex, Mr.  Hartright--which will you have, tea or coffee?--no woman does think  much of her own sex, although few of them confess it as freely as I do.  Dear me, you look puzzled.  Why? Are you wondering what you will have  for breakfast? or are you surprised at my careless way of talking? In  the first case, I advise you, as a friend, to have nothing to do with  that cold ham at your elbow, and to wait till the omelette comes in.  In the second case, I will give you some tea to compose your spirits,  and do all a woman can (which is very little, by-the-bye) to hold my  tongue.\"    She handed me my cup of tea, laughing gaily.  Her light flow of talk,  and her lively familiarity of manner with a total stranger, were  accompanied by an unaffected naturalness and an easy inborn confidence  in herself and her position, which would have secured her the respect  of the most audacious man breathing.  While it was impossible to be  formal and reserved in her company, it was more than impossible to take  the faintest vestige of a liberty with her, even in thought.  I felt  this instinctively, even while I caught the infection of her own bright  gaiety of spirits--even while I did my best to answer her in her own  frank, lively way.    \"Yes, yes,\" she said, when I had suggested the only explanation I could  offer, to account for my perplexed looks, \"I understand. You are such a  perfect stranger in the house, that you are puzzled by my familiar  references to the worthy inhabitants.  Natural enough: I ought to have  thought of it before.  At any rate, I can set it right now.  Suppose I  begin with myself, so as to get done with that part of the subject as  soon as possible? My name is Marian Halcombe; and I am as inaccurate as  women usually are, in calling Mr. Fairlie my uncle, and Miss Fairlie my  sister.  My mother was twice married: the first time to Mr. Halcombe,  my father; the second time to Mr. Fairlie, my half-sister's father.  Except that we are both orphans, we are in every respect as unlike each  other as possible.  My father was a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's father  was a rich man.  I have got nothing, and she has a fortune.  I am dark  and ugly, and she is fair and pretty. Everybody thinks me crabbed and  odd (with perfect justice); and everybody thinks her sweet-tempered and  charming (with more justice still).  In short, she is an angel; and I  am----  Try some of that marmalade, Mr. Hartright, and finish the  sentence, in the name of female propriety, for yourself.  What am I to  tell you about Mr. Fairlie? Upon my honour, I hardly know.  He is sure  to send for you after breakfast, and you can study him for yourself. In  the meantime, I may inform you, first, that he is the late Mr.  Fairlie's younger brother; secondly, that he is a single man; and  thirdly, that he is Miss Fairlie's guardian.  I won't live without her,  and she can't live without me; and that is how I come to be at  Limmeridge House.  My sister and I are honestly fond of each other;  which, you will say, is perfectly unaccountable, under the  circumstances, and I quite agree with you--but so it is.  You must  please both of us, Mr. Hartright, or please neither of us: and, what is  still more trying, you will be thrown entirely upon our society.  Mrs.  Vesey is an excellent person, who possesses all the cardinal virtues,  and counts for nothing; and Mr. Fairlie is too great an invalid to be a  companion for anybody.  I don't know what is the matter with him, and  the doctors don't know what is the matter with him, and he doesn't know  himself what is the matter with him.  We all say it's on the nerves,  and we none of us know what we mean when we say it.  However, I advise  you to humour his little peculiarities, when you see him to-day.  Admire his collection of coins, prints, and water-colour drawings, and  you will win his heart.  Upon my word, if you can be contented with a  quiet country life, I don't see why you should not get on very well  here.  From breakfast to lunch, Mr. Fairlie's drawings will occupy you.  After lunch, Miss Fairlie and I shoulder our sketch-books, and go out  to misrepresent Nature, under your directions. Drawing is her favourite  whim, mind, not mine.  Women can't draw--their minds are too flighty,  and their eyes are too inattentive. No matter--my sister likes it; so I  waste paint and spoil paper, for her sake, as composedly as any woman  in England.  As for the evenings, I think we can help you through them.  Miss Fairlie plays delightfully.  For my own poor part, I don't know  one note of music from the other; but I can match you at chess,  backgammon, ecarte, and (with the inevitable female drawbacks) even at  billiards as well.  What do you think of the programme? Can you  reconcile yourself to our quiet, regular life? or do you mean to be  restless, and secretly thirst for change and adventure, in the humdrum  atmosphere of Limmeridge House?\"    She had run on thus far, in her gracefully bantering way, with no other  interruptions on my part than the unimportant replies which politeness  required of me.  The turn of the expression, however, in her last  question, or rather the one chance word, \"adventure,\" lightly as it  fell from her lips, recalled my thoughts to my meeting with the woman  in white, and urged me to discover the connection which the stranger's  own reference to Mrs. Fairlie informed me must once have existed  between the nameless fugitive from the Asylum, and the former mistress  of Limmeridge House.    \"Even if I were the most restless of mankind,\" I said, \"I should be in  no danger of thirsting after adventures for some time to come.  The  very night before I arrived at this house, I met with an adventure; and  the wonder and excitement of it, I can assure you, Miss Halcombe, will  last me for the whole term of my stay in Cumberland, if not for a much  longer period.\"    \"You don't say so, Mr. Hartright! May I hear it?\"    \"You have a claim to hear it.  The chief person in the adventure was a  total stranger to me, and may perhaps be a total stranger to you; but  she certainly mentioned the name of the late Mrs. Fairlie in terms of  the sincerest gratitude and regard.\"    \"Mentioned my mother's name! You interest me indescribably.  Pray go  on.\"    I at once related the circumstances under which I had met the woman in  white, exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what she had said  to me about Mrs. Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.    Miss Halcombe's bright resolute eyes looked eagerly into mine, from the  beginning of the narrative to the end.  Her face expressed vivid  interest and astonishment, but nothing more.  She was evidently as far  from knowing of any clue to the mystery as I was myself.    \"Are you quite sure of those words referring to my mother?\" she asked.    \"Quite sure,\" I replied.  \"Whoever she may be, the woman was once at  school in the village of Limmeridge, was treated with especial kindness  by Mrs. Fairlie, and, in grateful remembrance of that kindness, feels  an affectionate interest in all surviving members of the family.  She  knew that Mrs. Fairlie and her husband were both dead; and she spoke of  Miss Fairlie as if they had known each other when they were children.\"    \"You said, I think, that she denied belonging to this place?\"    \"Yes, she told me she came from Hampshire.\"    \"And you entirely failed to find out her name?\"    \"Entirely.\"    \"Very strange.  I think you were quite justified, Mr. Hartright, in  giving the poor creature her liberty, for she seems to have done  nothing in your presence to show herself unfit to enjoy it. But I wish  you had been a little more resolute about finding out her name.  We  must really clear up this mystery, in some way.  You had better not  speak of it yet to Mr. Fairlie, or to my sister. They are both of them,  I am certain, quite as ignorant of who the woman is, and of what her  past history in connection with us can be, as I am myself.  But they  are also, in widely different ways, rather nervous and sensitive; and  you would only fidget one and alarm the other to no purpose.  As for  myself, I am all aflame with curiosity, and I devote my whole energies  to the business of discovery from this moment.  When my mother came  here, after her second marriage, she certainly established the village  school just as it exists at the present time.  But the old teachers are  all dead, or gone elsewhere; and no enlightenment is to be hoped for  from that quarter.

She must be left free to her own choice.    Jane sent Henry a letter of dismission; he her one of a legal bearing,  in which he balanced his disappointment by a few hundreds.    To brave her mother's fury, nearly overcame her, but the consolation of  a kind father and aunt cheered her on. After a suitable interval she was  married to George, and removed to his home in Vermont. Thus another  light disappeared from Nig's horizon. Another was soon to follow. Jack  was anxious to try his skill in providing for his own support; so a  situation as clerk in a store was procured in a Western city, and six  months after Jane's departure, was Nig abandoned to the tender mercies  of Mary and her mother. As if to remove the last vestige of earthly joy,  Mrs. Bellmont sold the companion and pet of Frado, the dog Fido.          CHAPTER VI.    VARIETIES.    \"Hard are life's early steps; and but that youth is buoyant, confident,  and strong in hope, men would behold its threshold and despair.\"      THE sorrow of Frado was very great for her pet, and Mr. Bellmont by  great exertion obtained it again, much to the relief of the child. To be  thus deprived of all her sources of pleasure was a sure way to exalt  their worth, and Fido became, in her estimation, a more valuable  presence than the human beings who surrounded her.    James had now been married a number of years, and frequent requests for  a visit from the family were at last accepted, and Mrs. Bellmont made  great preparations for a fall sojourn in Baltimore. Mary was installed  housekeeper--in name merely, for Nig was the only moving power in the  house. Although suffering from their joint severity, she felt safer than  to be thrown wholly upon an ardent, passionate, unrestrained young lady,  whom she always hated and felt it hard to be obliged to obey. The trial  she must meet. Were Jack or Jane at home she would have some refuge; one  only remained; good Aunt Abby was still in the house.    She saw the fast receding coach which conveyed her master and mistress  with regret, and begged for one favor only, that James would send for  her when they returned, a hope she had confidently cherished all these  five years.    She was now able to do all the washing, ironing, baking, and the common  et cetera of household duties, though but fourteen. Mary left all for  her to do, though she affected great responsibility. She would show  herself in the kitchen long enough to relieve herself of some command,  better withheld; or insist upon some compliance to her wishes in some  department which she was very imperfectly acquainted with, very much  less than the person she was addressing; and so impetuous till her  orders were obeyed, that to escape the turmoil, Nig would often go  contrary to her own knowledge to gain a respite.    Nig was taken sick! What could be done The WORK, certainly, but not by  Miss Mary. So Nig would work while she could remain erect, then sink  down upon the floor, or a chair, till she could rally for a fresh  effort. Mary would look in upon her, chide her for her laziness,  threaten to tell mother when she came home, and so forth.    \"Nig!\" screamed Mary, one of her sickest days, \"come here, and sweep  these threads from the carpet.\" She attempted to drag her weary limbs  along, using the broom as support. Impatient of delay, she called again,  but with a different request. \"Bring me some wood, you lazy jade,  quick.\" Nig rested the broom against the wall, and started on the fresh  behest.    Too long gone. Flushed with anger, she rose and greeted her with, \"What  are you gone so long for? Bring it in quick, I say.\"    \"I am coming as quick as I can,\" she replied, entering the door.    \"Saucy, impudent nigger, you! is this the way you answer me?\" and taking  a large carving knife from the table, she hurled it, in her rage, at the  defenceless girl.    Dodging quickly, it fastened in the ceiling a few inches from where she  stood. There rushed on Mary's mental vision a picture of bloodshed, in  which she was the perpetrator, and the sad consequences of what was so  nearly an actual occurrence.    \"Tell anybody of this, if you dare. If you tell Aunt Abby, I'll  certainly kill you,\" said she, terrified. She returned to her room,  brushed her threads herself; was for a day or two more guarded, and so  escaped deserved and merited penalty.    Oh, how long the weeks seemed which held Nig in subjection to Mary; but  they passed like all earth's sorrows and joys. Mr. and Mrs. B. returned  delighted with their visit, and laden with rich presents for Mary. No  word of hope for Nig. James was quite unwell, and would come home the  next spring for a visit.    This, thought Nig, will be my time of release. I shall go back with him.    From early dawn until after all were retired, was she toiling,  overworked, disheartened, longing for relief.    Exposure from heat to cold, or the reverse, often destroyed her health  for short intervals. She wore no shoes until after frost, and snow even,  appeared; and bared her feet again before the last vestige of winter  disappeared. These sudden changes she was so illy guarded against,  nearly conquered her physical system. Any word of complaint was severely  repulsed or cruelly punished.    She was told she had much more than she deserved. So that manual labor  was not in reality her only burden; but such an incessant torrent of  scolding and boxing and threatening, was enough to deter one of maturer  years from remaining within sound of the strife.    It is impossible to give an impression of the manifest enjoyment of Mrs.  B. in these kitchen scenes. It was her favorite exercise to enter the  apartment noisily, vociferate orders, give a few sudden blows to quicken  Nig's pace, then return to the sitting room with SUCH a satisfied  expression, congratulating herself upon her thorough house-keeping  qualities.    She usually rose in the morning at the ringing of the bell for  breakfast; if she were heard stirring before that time, Nig knew well  there was an extra amount of scolding to be borne.    No one now stood between herself and Frado, but Aunt Abby. And if SHE  dared to interfere in the least, she was ordered back to her \"own  quarters.\" Nig would creep slyly into her room, learn what she could of  her regarding the absent, and thus gain some light in the thick gloom of  care and toil and sorrow in which she was immersed.    The first of spring a letter came from James, announcing declining  health. He must try northern air as a restorative; so Frado joyfully  prepared for this agreeable increase of the family, this addition to her  cares.    He arrived feeble, lame, from his disease, so changed Frado wept at his  appearance, fearing he would be removed from her forever. He kindly  greeted her, took her to the parlor to see his wife and child, and said  many things to kindle smiles on her sad face.    Frado felt so happy in his presence, so safe from maltreatment! He was  to her a shelter. He observed, silently, the ways of the house a few  days; Nig still took her meals in the same manner as formerly, having  the same allowance of food. He, one day, bade her not remove the food,  but sit down to the table and eat.    \"She WILL, mother,\" said he, calmly, but imperatively; I'm determined;  she works hard; I've watched her. Now, while I stay, she is going to sit  down HERE, and eat such food as we eat.\"    A few sparks from the mother's black eyes were the only reply; she  feared to oppose where she knew she could not prevail. So Nig's standing  attitude, and selected diet vanished.    Her clothing was yet poor and scanty; she was not blessed with a Sunday  attire; for she was never permitted to attend church with her mistress.  \"Religion was not meant for niggers,\" SHE said; when the husband and  brothers were absent, she would drive Mrs. B. and Mary there, then  return, and go for them at the close of the service, but never remain.  Aunt Abby would take her to evening meetings, held in the neighborhood,  which Mrs. B. never attended; and impart to her lessons of truth and  grace as they walked to the place of prayer.    Many of less piety would scorn to present so doleful a figure; Mrs. B.  had shaved her glossy ringlets; and, in her coarse cloth gown and  ancient bonnet, she was anything but an enticing object. But Aunt Abby  looked within. She saw a soul to save, an immortality of happiness to  secure.    These evenings were eagerly anticipated by Nig; it was such a pleasant  release from labor.    Such perfect contrast in the melody and prayers of these good people to  the harsh tones which fell on her ears during the day.    Soon she had all their sacred songs at command, and enlivened her toil  by accompanying it with this melody.    James encouraged his aunt in her efforts. He had found the SAVIOUR, he  wished to have Frado's desolate heart gladdened, quieted, sustained, by  HIS presence. He felt sure there were elements in her heart which,  transformed and purified by the gospel, would make her worthy the esteem  and friendship of the world. A kind, affectionate heart, native wit, and  common sense, and the pertness she sometimes exhibited, he felt if  restrained properly, might become useful in originating a self-reliance  which would be of service to her in after years.    Yet it was not possible to compass all this, while she remained where  she was. He wished to be cautious about pressing too closely her claims  on his mother, as it would increase the burdened one he so anxiously  wished to relieve. He cheered her on with the hope of returning with his  family, when he recovered sufficiently.    Nig seemed awakened to new hopes and aspirations, and realized a longing  for the future, hitherto unknown.    To complete Nig's"]]]
