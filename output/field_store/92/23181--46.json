Back and back it slid for ten feet until it had disclosed at its  right a narrow doorway leading into a dark and narrow corridor that  paralleled the outer wall.  Scarcely was the entrance uncovered  than Woola and I had leaped through--then the door slipped quietly  back into place.    Down the corridor at some distance I saw the faint reflection of  a light, and toward this we made our way.  At the point where the  light shone was a sharp turn, and a little distance beyond this a  brilliantly lighted chamber.    Here we discovered a spiral stairway leading up from the center of  the circular room.    Immediately I knew that we had reached the center of the base of  the Temple of the Sun--the spiral runway led upward past the inner  walls of the prison cells.  Somewhere above me was Dejah Thoris,  unless Thurid and Matai Shang had already succeeded in stealing  her.    We had scarcely started up the runway when Woola suddenly displayed  the wildest excitement.  He leaped back and forth, snapping at my  legs and harness, until I thought that he was mad, and finally when  I pushed him from me and started once more to ascend he grasped my  sword arm between his jaws and dragged me back.    No amount of scolding or cuffing would suffice to make him release  me, and I was entirely at the mercy of his brute strength unless  I cared to use my dagger upon him with my left hand; but, mad or  no, I had not the heart to run the sharp blade into that faithful  body.    Down into the chamber he dragged me, and across it to the side  opposite that at which we had entered.  Here was another doorway  leading into a corridor which ran directly down a steep incline.  Without a moment's hesitation Woola jerked me along this rocky  passage.    Presently he stopped and released me, standing between me and the  way we had come, looking up into my face as though to ask if I would  now follow him voluntarily or if he must still resort to force.    Looking ruefully at the marks of his great teeth upon my bare arm  I decided to do as he seemed to wish me to do.  After all, his strange  instinct might be more dependable than my faulty human judgment.    And well it was that I had been forced to follow him.  But a  short distance from the circular chamber we came suddenly into a  brilliantly lighted labyrinth of crystal glass partitioned passages.    At first I thought it was one vast, unbroken chamber, so clear and  transparent were the walls of the winding corridors, but after I  had nearly brained myself a couple of times by attempting to pass  through solid vitreous walls I went more carefully.    We had proceeded but a few yards along the corridor that had given  us entrance to this strange maze when Woola gave mouth to a most  frightful roar, at the same time dashing against the clear partition  at our left.    The resounding echoes of that fearsome cry were still reverberating  through the subterranean chambers when I saw the thing that had  startled it from the faithful beast.    Far in the distance, dimly through the many thicknesses of intervening  crystal, as in a haze that made them seem unreal and ghostly, I  discerned the figures of eight people--three females and five men.    At the same instant, evidently startled by Woola's fierce cry, they  halted and looked about.  Then, of a sudden, one of them, a woman,  held her arms out toward me, and even at that great distance I could  see that her lips moved--it was Dejah Thoris, my ever beautiful  and ever youthful Princess of Helium.    With her were Thuvia of Ptarth, Phaidor, daughter of Matai Shang,  and Thurid, and the Father of Therns, and the three lesser therns  that had accompanied them.    Thurid shook his fist at me, and then two of the therns grasped  Dejah Thoris and Thuvia roughly by their arms and hurried them on.  A moment later they had disappeared into a stone corridor beyond  the labyrinth of glass.    They say that love is blind; but so great a love as that of Dejah  Thoris that knew me even beneath the thern disguise I wore and across  the misty vista of that crystal maze must indeed be far from blind.          THE SECRET TOWER      I have no stomach to narrate the monotonous events of the tedious  days that Woola and I spent ferreting our way across the labyrinth  of glass, through the dark and devious ways beyond that led beneath  the Valley Dor and Golden Cliffs to emerge at last upon the flank  of the Otz Mountains just above the Valley of Lost Souls--that  pitiful purgatory peopled by the poor unfortunates who dare not  continue their abandoned pilgrimage to Dor, or return to the various  lands of the outer world from whence they came.    Here the trail of Dejah Thoris' abductors led along the mountains'  base, across steep and rugged ravines, by the side of appalling  precipices, and sometimes out into the valley, where we found  fighting aplenty with the members of the various tribes that make  up the population of this vale of hopelessness.    But through it all we came at last to where the way led up a narrow  gorge that grew steeper and more impracticable at every step until  before us loomed a mighty fortress buried beneath the side of an  overhanging cliff.    Here was the secret hiding place of Matai Shang, Father of Therns.  Here, surrounded by a handful of the faithful, the hekkador of  the ancient faith, who had once been served by millions of vassals  and dependents, dispensed the spiritual words among the half dozen  nations of Barsoom that still clung tenaciously to their false and  discredited religion.    Darkness was just falling as we came in sight of the seemingly  impregnable walls of this mountain stronghold, and lest we be seen  I drew back with Woola behind a jutting granite promontory, into  a clump of the hardy, purple scrub that thrives upon the barren  sides of Otz.    Here we lay until the quick transition from daylight to darkness  had passed.  Then I crept out to approach the fortress walls in  search of a way within.    Either through carelessness or over-confidence in the supposed  inaccessibility of their hiding place, the triple-barred gate stood  ajar.  Beyond were a handful of guards, laughing and talking over  one of their incomprehensible Barsoomian games.    I saw that none of the guardsmen had been of the party that  accompanied Thurid and Matai Shang; and so, relying entirely upon  my disguise, I walked boldly through the gateway and up to the  thern guard.    The men stopped their game and looked up at me, but there was no  sign of suspicion.  Similarly they looked at Woola, growling at my  heel.    \"Kaor!\" I said in true Martian greeting, and the warriors arose and  saluted me.  \"I have but just found my way hither from the Golden  Cliffs,\" I continued, \"and seek audience with the hekkador, Matai  Shang, Father of Therns.  Where may he be found?\"    \"Follow me,\" said one of the guard, and, turning, led me across  the outer courtyard toward a second buttressed wall.    Why the apparent ease with which I seemingly deceived them did  not rouse my suspicions I know not, unless it was that my mind was  still so full of that fleeting glimpse of my beloved princess that  there was room in it for naught else.  Be that as it may, the fact  is that I marched buoyantly behind my guide straight into the jaws  of death.    Afterward I learned that thern spies had been aware of my coming  for hours before I reached the hidden fortress.    The gate had been purposely left ajar to tempt me on.  The guards  had been schooled well in their part of the conspiracy; and I,  more like a schoolboy than a seasoned warrior, ran headlong into  the trap.    At the far side of the outer court a narrow door let into the  angle made by one of the buttresses with the wall.  Here my guide  produced a key and opened the way within; then, stepping back, he  motioned me to enter.    \"Matai Shang is in the temple court beyond,\" he said; and as Woola  and I passed through, the fellow closed the door quickly upon us.    The nasty laugh that came to my ears through the heavy planking of  the door after the lock clicked was my first intimation that all  was not as it should be.    I found myself in a small, circular chamber within the buttress.  Before me a door opened, presumably, upon the inner court beyond.  For a moment I hesitated, all my suspicions now suddenly, though  tardily, aroused; then, with a shrug of my shoulders, I opened the  door and stepped out into the glare of torches that lighted the  inner court.    Directly opposite me a massive tower rose to a height of three  hundred feet.  It was of the strangely beautiful modern Barsoomian  style of architecture, its entire surface hand carved in bold  relief with intricate and fanciful designs.  Thirty feet above  the courtyard and overlooking it was a broad balcony, and there,  indeed, was Matai Shang, and with him were Thurid and Phaidor,  Thuvia, and Dejah Thoris--the last two heavily ironed.  A handful  of thern warriors stood just behind the little party.    As I entered the enclosure the eyes of those in the balcony were  full upon me.    An ugly smile distorted the cruel lips of Matai Shang.  Thurid  hurled a taunt at me and placed a familiar hand upon the shoulder  of my princess.  Like a tigress she turned upon him, striking the  beast a heavy blow with the manacles upon her wrist.    He would have struck back had not Matai Shang interfered, and then  I saw that the two men were not over-friendly; for the manner of  the thern was arrogant and domineering as he made it plain to the  First Born that the Princess of Helium was the personal property  of the Father of Therns.  And Thurid's bearing toward the ancient  hekkador savored not at all of liking or respect.    When the altercation in the balcony had subsided Matai Shang turned  again to me.    \"Earth man,\" he cried, \"you have earned a more ignoble death than  now lies within our weakened power to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#7)"],[1,"a story which, if accurate, entitles him to the civic crown  which the Romans used to give to one who saved the life of a citizen.  When Gollaher was eleven and Lincoln eight the two boys were in the  woods in pursuit of partridges; in trying to \"coon\" across Knob Creek  on a log, Lincoln fell in and Gollaher fished him out with a sycamore  branch--a service to the Republic, the value of which it would be  difficult to compute.]          CHAPTER II    INDIANA      [Sidenote: 1818.]    By the time the boy Abraham had attained his seventh year, the social  condition of Kentucky had changed considerably from the early pioneer  days. Life had assumed a more settled and orderly course. The old  barbarous equality of the earlier time was gone; a difference of  classes began to be seen. Those who held slaves assumed a distinct  social superiority over those who did not. Thomas Lincoln, concluding  that Kentucky was no country for a poor man, determined to seek his  fortune in Indiana. He had heard of rich and unoccupied lands in Perry  County in that State, and thither he determined to go. He built a rude  raft, loaded it with his kit of tools and four hundred gallons of  whisky, and trusted his fortunes to the winding water-courses. He met  with only one accident on his way: his raft capsized in the Ohio  River, but he fished up his kit of tools and most of the ardent  spirits, and arrived safely at the place of a settler named Posey,  with whom he left his odd invoice of household goods for the  wilderness, while he started on foot to look for a home in the dense  forest. He selected a spot which pleased him in his first day's  journey. He then walked back to Knob Creek and brought his family on  to their new home. No humbler cavalcade ever invaded the Indiana  timber. Besides his wife and two children, his earthly possessions  were of the slightest, for the backs of two borrowed horses sufficed  for the load. Insufficient bedding and clothing, a few pans and  kettles, were their sole movable wealth. They relied on Lincoln's kit  of tools for their furniture, and on his rifle for their food. At  Posey's they hired a wagon and literally hewed a path through the  wilderness to their new habitation near Little Pigeon Creek, a mile  and a half east of Gentryville, in a rich and fertile forest country.    Thomas Lincoln, with the assistance of his wife and children, built a  temporary shelter of the sort called in the frontier language \"a half-  faced camp\"; merely a shed of poles, which defended the inmates on  three sides from foul weather, but left them open to its inclemency in  front. For a whole year his family lived in this wretched fold, while  he was clearing a little patch of ground for planting corn, and  building a rough cabin for a permanent residence. They moved into the  latter before it was half completed; for by this time the Sparrows had  followed the Lincolns from Kentucky, and the half-faced camp was given  up to them. But the rude cabin seemed so spacious and comfortable  after the squalor of \"the camp,\" that Thomas Lincoln did no further  work on it for a long time. He left it for a year or two without  doors, or windows, or floor. The battle for existence allowed him no  time for such superfluities. He raised enough corn to support life;  the dense forest around him abounded in every form of feathered game;  a little way from his cabin an open glade was full of deer-licks, and  an hour or two of idle waiting was generally rewarded by a shot at a  fine deer, which would furnish meat for a week, and material for  breeches and shoes. His cabin was like that of other pioneers. A few  three-legged stools; a bedstead made of poles stuck between the logs  in the angle of the cabin, the outside corner supported by a crotched  stick driven into the ground; the table, a huge hewed log standing on  four legs; a pot, kettle, and skillet, and a few tin and pewter dishes  were all the furniture. The boy Abraham climbed at night to his bed of  leaves in the loft, by a ladder of wooden pins driven into the logs.    This life has been vaunted by poets and romancers as a happy and  healthful one. Even Dennis Hanks, speaking of his youthful days when  his only home was the half-faced camp, says, \"I tell you, Billy, I  enjoyed myself better then than I ever have since.\" But we may  distrust the reminiscences of old settlers, who see their youth in the  flattering light of distance. The life was neither enjoyable nor  wholesome. The rank woods were full of malaria, and singular epidemics  from time to time ravaged the settlements. In the autumn of 1818 the  little community of Pigeon Creek was almost exterminated by a  frightful pestilence called the milk-sickness, or, in the dialect of  the country, \"the milk-sick.\" It is a mysterious disease which has  been the theme of endless wrangling among Western physicians, and the  difficulty of ascertaining anything about it has been greatly  increased by the local sensitiveness which forbids any one to admit  that any well-defined case has ever been seen in his neighborhood,  \"although just over the creek (or in the next county) they have had it  bad.\" It seems to have been a malignant form of fever--attributed  variously to malaria and to the eating of poisonous herbs by the  cattle--attacking cattle as well as human beings, attended with  violent retching and a burning sensation in the stomach, often  terminating fatally on the third day. In many cases those who  apparently recovered lingered for years with health seriously  impaired. Among the Pioneers of Pigeon Creek, so ill-fed, ill-housed,  and uncared for, there was little prospect of recovery from such a  grave disorder. The Sparrows, husband and wife, died early in October,  and Nancy Hanks Lincoln followed them after an interval of a few days.  Thomas Lincoln made the coffins for his dead \"out of green lumber cut  with a whipsaw,\" and they were all buried, with scant ceremony, in a  little clearing of the forest. It is related of young Abraham, that he  sorrowed most of all that his mother should have been laid away with  such maimed rites, and that he contrived several months later to have  a wandering preacher named David Elkin brought to the settlement, to  deliver a funeral sermon over her grave, already white with the early  winter snows. [Footnote: A stone has been placed over the site of the  grave \"by P. E. Studebaker, of South Bend, Indiana.\" The stone bears  the following inscription: \"Nancy Hanks Lincoln, mother of President  Lincoln, died October 5th, A. D. 1818, aged 35 years. Erected by a  friend of her martyred son, 1879.\"]    This was the dreariest winter of his life, for before the next  December came his father had brought from Kentucky a new wife, who was  to change the lot of all the desolate little family very much for the  better. Sarah Bush had been an acquaintance of Thomas Lincoln before  his first marriage; she had, it is said, rejected him to marry one  Johnston, the jailer at Elizabethtown, who had died, leaving her with  three children, a boy and two girls. When Lincoln's widowhood had  lasted a year, he went down to Elizabethtown to begin again the wooing  broken off so many years before. He wasted no time in preliminaries,  but promptly made his wishes known, and the next morning they were  married. It was growing late in the autumn, and the pioneer probably  dreaded another lonely winter on Pigeon Creek. Mrs. Johnston was not  altogether portionless. She had a store of household goods which  filled a four-horse wagon borrowed of Ralph Grume, Thomas Lincoln's  brother-in-law, to transport the bride to Indiana. It took little time  for this energetic and honest Christian woman to make her influence  felt, even in those discouraging surroundings, and Thomas Lincoln and  the children were the better for her coming all the rest of their  lives. The lack of doors and floors was at once corrected. Her honest  pride inspired her husband to greater thrift and industry. The goods  she brought with her compelled some effort at harmony in the other  fittings of the house. She dressed the children in warmer clothing and  put them to sleep in comfortable beds. With this slight addition to  their resources the family were much improved in appearance, behavior,  and self-respect.    [Illustration:   SARAH BUSH LINCOLN AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY-SIX.]    Thomas Lincoln joined the Baptist church at Little Pigeon in 1823; his  oldest child, Sarah, followed his example three years later. They were  known as active and consistent members of that communion. Lincoln was  himself a good carpenter when he chose to work at his trade; a walnut  table made by him is still preserved as part of the furniture of the  church to which he belonged.    [Sidenote: MS. letter from the Rev. T.V. Robertson, pastor of the  Little Pigeon Baptist church.]    Such a woman as Sarah Bush could not be careless of so important a  matter as the education of her children, and they made the best use of  the scanty opportunities the neighborhood afforded. \"It was a wild  region,\" writes Mr. Lincoln, in one of those rare bits of  autobiography which he left behind him, \"with many bears and other  wild animals still in the woods. There were some schools so-called,  but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond 'readin',  writin', and cipherin' to the Rule of Three.' If a straggler supposed  to understand Latin happened to sojourn in the neighborhood, he was  looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely nothing to excite  ambition for education.\" But in the case of this ungainly boy there  was no necessity of any external incentive. A thirst for knowledge as  a means of rising in the world was innate in him. It had nothing to do  with that love of science for its own sake which has been so often  seen in lowly savants, who have sacrificed their lives to the pure  desire of knowing the works of God.
