True, while the boy was eating, he kept one eye on the  giant who was going at such rapid strides; but that gentleman  continued his progress in an unexceptionable manner, and needed no  attention.    When the afternoon was mostly gone, Baldy declared that they had gone  the better part of a hundred miles.    The boy could hardly credit it at first; but, when he recalled that  they had scarcely paused for seven hours, and had gone a portion of  the distance at a very high rate, he saw that his friend was not far  out of the way.    It lacked yet several hours of dusk, when the trapper exclaimed:    'Yonder is an emigrant train, now make for 'em!'                                CHAPTER VIII. INDIANS.    THE STEAM man was headed straight toward the emigrant train, and  advanced at a speed which rapidly came up with it.    They could see, while yet a considerable distance away, that they had  attracted notice, and the emigrants had paused and ware surveying them  with a wonder which it would be difficult to express.    It is said that when Robert Fulton's first steamboat ascended the  Hudson, it created a consternation and terror such as had never before  been known, many believing that it was the harbinger of the final  destruction of the world.    Of course, at this late day, no such excitement can be created by any  human invention, but the sight of a creature speeding over the country,  impelled by steam, and bearing such a grotesque resemblance to a  gigantic man, could not but startle all who should see it for the  first time.    The steam man advanced at a rate which was quite moderate, until  within a quarter of a mile of the astonished train, when the boy let  on a full head of steam and instantly bounded forward like a meteor.  As it came opposite the amazed company, the whistle was palled, and  it-gave forth a shriek hideous enough to set a man crazy.    The horses and animals of the emigrant train could be seen rearing and  plunging, while the men stood too appalled to do anything except gaze  in stupid and speechless amazement.    There were one or two, however, who had sense enough to perceive that  there was nothing at all very supernatural about it, and they shouted  to them to halt; but our two friends concluded it was not desirable to  have any company, and they only slackened their speed, without  halting.    But there was one of the emigrants who determined to know something  more about it and, mounting his horse, he started after it on a full  run. The trapper did not perceive him until he had approached quite  close, when they again put on a full head of steam, and they went  bounding forward at a rate which threatened to tear them to pieces.    But the keen perception of the boy had detected what they were able to  do without real risk: and, without putting his invention to its very  best, he kept up a speed which steadily drew them away from their  pursuer, who finally became discouraged, checked his animal, and  turned round and rode back to his friends, a not much wiser man.    This performance gave our friends great delight. It showed them that  they were really the owners of a prize whose value was incalculable.    'Ef the old thing will only last,' said Baldy, when they had sunk down  to a moderate trot again.    'What's to binder?'    'Dunno; yer oughter be able to tell. But these new-fangled things  generally go well at first, and then, afore yer know it, they bust all  to blazes.'    'No fear of this. I made this fellow so big that there is plenty of  room to have everything strong and give it a chance to work.'    'Wal, you're the smartest feller I ever seen, big or little. Whoever  heard of a man going by steam?'    'I have, often; but I never saw it. I expect when I go back to make  steam horses.'    'And birds, I s'pose?'    'Perhaps so; it will take some time to get such things in shape, but I  hope to do it after awhile.'    'Skulp me! but thar must be some things that you can't do, and I think  you've mentioned 'em.    'Perhaps so,' was the quiet reply. 'When you git through with this  'Western trip, what are you goin' to do with this old feller?'    'I don't know. I may sell him, if anybody wants him.'    'No fear of that; I'll take him off your hands, and give you a good  price for him.'    'What good will' he do you?'    'Why, you can make more money with him than Barnum ever did with his  Woolly Home.'    'How so?' inquired the boy, with great simplicity.    'Take him through the country and show him to the people. I tell yer  they'd run after such things. Get out yer pictures of him, and the  folks would break thar necks to see him. I tell yer, thar's a fortune  thar!'    The trapper spoke emphatically like one who knows.    As it was growing dusk, they deemed it best to look for some  camping-place. There was considerable danger in running at night, as  there was no moon, and they might run into some gully or ravine and  dislocate or wrench some portion of their machinery, which might  result in an irreparable catastrophe.    Before it was fairly dark they headed toward a small clump of trees,  where everything looked favorable.    'You see we must find a place where there is plenty water and fuel,  for we need both,' remarked the boy.    'Thar's plenty of wood, as yer see with yer eyes,' replied Baldy, 'and  when trees look as keen as that, thar's purty sure sign thar's water  not fur off.'    'That's all we want,' was the observation of the engineer as he headed  toward the point indicated.    Things were growing quite indistinct, when the steam man gave its last  puff, and came to rest in the margin of the grove. The fires were  instantly drawn, and every-thing was put in as good shape as possible,  by the boy, while the trapper made a tour of examination through the  grove. He came back with the report that everything was as they  wished.    'Thar's a big stream of water runnin' right through the middle, and  yer can see the wood fur yourself.'    'Any signs of Indians?' asked the boy, in a low voice, as if fearful  of being overheard. 'Dunno; it's too dark to tell.'    'If it's dangerous here, we had better go on.'    'Yer ain't much used to this part the world. You may keep powerful  easy till mornin'.'    As they could not feel certain whether in danger or not, it was the  part of prudence to believe that some peril threatened them.  Accordingly they ate their evening meal in silence, and curled up in  the bottom of their wagon, first taking the precaution to fill their  tank with water, and placing a portion of wood and kindlings in the  bowels of the steam man, so that in case of danger, they would be able  to leave at a short notice.    Johnny Brainerd was soon sound asleep, and the trapper followed, but  it was with that light, restless slumber which is disturbed by the  slightest noise.    So it came about that, but a few hours had passed, when he was aroused  by some slight disturbance in the grove. Raising his head he  endeavored to peer into the darkness, but he could detect nothing.    But he was certain that something was there, and he gently aroused the  boy beside him.    'What is it?' queried the latter in a whisper, but fully wide-awake.    'I think thar ar Ingins among the trees.' 'Good heavens! what shall we  do?'    'Keep still and don't git skeart! sh!' At this juncture he heard a  slight noise, and cautiously raising his head, he caught the outlines  of an Indian, in a crouching position, stealing along in front of the  wagon, as though examining the curious contrivance. He undoubtedly was  greatly puzzled, but he remained only a few minutes, when he withdrew  as silently as he had come.    'Stay yer, while I take a look around!' whispered Baldy, as he slid  softly out the wagon, while the boy did the same, waiting; until sure  that the trapper would not see him.    Baldy spent a half-hour in making his reconnoissance. The result of it  was that he found there were fully twenty Indians, thoroughly  wide-awake, who were moving stealthily through the grove.    When he came back, it was with the conviction that their only safety  lay in getting away without delay.    'We've got to learn,' said he, 'how long it will take yer to git up  steam, youngster?'    'There is a full head on now. I fired up the minute you left  the-wagon.'    'Good!' exclaimed Baldy, who in his excitement did not observe that  the steam man was seething, and apparently ready to explode with the  tremendous power pent up in its vitals.                        CHAPTER IX. THE STEAM MAN AS A HUNTER.    AT this juncture the trapper whispered that the Indians were again  stealing around them. Johnny's first proceeding was to pull the  whistle wide open, awaking the stillness of the night by a hideous,  prolonged screech.    Then, letting on the steam, the man made a bound forward, and the next  moment was careering over the prairie like a demon of darkness, its  horrid whistle giving forth almost one continual yell, such as no  American Indian has ever been able to imitate.    When they had gone a few hundred yards, Johnny again slackened the  speed, for there was great risk in going at this tremendous rate,  where all was entire blank darkness, and there was no telling into  what danger they might run. At the speed at which they were going they  would have bounded into a river before they could have checked  themselves.    'Yer furgot one thing,' said Baldy, when they had considerably  moderated their gait, and were using great caution.    'What is that?'    'Yer oughter had a lamp in front, so we could travel at night, jist as  well as day.'    'You are right; I don't see how I came to forget that. We could have  frightened the Indians more completely, and there would have been some  consolation in traveling at such a time.'    'Is it too late yet?'    'Couldn't do it without going"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#7)"],[1,"g, in addition to ordering Grant to return and survey the  deep bay which he had passed in Bass Strait between Cape Sir William  Grant and Wilson's Promontory, instructed him to ascertain the correct  latitude of the promontory and of the islands lying off it. He was also  told to survey King Island, then to sail to King George's Sound and, in  returning to Wilson's Promontory, to make a general survey of the whole  of the south coast, going to the head of every inlet as far as possible.  Dr. Bass, when discovering Bass Strait, had rounded the promontory and  entered a harbour which, as Grant has told us, he named from its relative  situation--Western Port. In his journal Grant says that it was reserved  for the Lady Nelson to ascertain accurately the extent of Bass Strait,  but he did not carry out the whole of King's instructions on this second  voyage although his examinations of Jervis Bay and of Western Port proved  of great value and added much to the knowledge of both harbours.    Besides Ensign Barrallier, Mr. Caley, botanist, four soldiers of the New  South Wales Corps and two natives (Euranabie and his wife Worogan) went  with the expedition, and Mr. John Murray joined the ship as first mate*  (* Formerly Master's Mate on board H.M.S. Porpoise.). The Bee, of 15  tons, formerly a ship's launch, was also fitted out to accompany her.    The two ships left Port Jackson on March 8th, Lieutenant Grant  particularly wishing to make the examination of Jervis Bay* (* Jervis  Bay, named in honour of John Jervis, Lord St. Vincent, was discovered by  Lieutenant Richard Bowen in 1791.) on his way southwards in order \"to  secure a harbour\" if obliged to run out of Bass Strait. The Bee, however,  did not stay long with the Lady Nelson. On the morning of the 9th the  Master hove to and informed Grant that he had shipped much water and that  the sea was too heavy for him. Before sending the vessel back to Port  Jackson Grant wrote a letter to the Governor at Sydney stating the reason  of her return. He placed the letter between two flat pieces of lead, and  running close to the Bee threw it on board. The Lady Nelson then  continued her voyage, and at 4 P.M. on the 10th sighted the north head of  Jervis Bay bearing west-south-west 8 or 9 miles distant. At seven o'clock  on the following morning the first mate was sent in the boat to look for  an anchorage, and returned at nine with one of the natives, bringing the  information that there was good holding ground in the southernmost cove  between an island and the main. At half-past ten the Lady Nelson anchored  in this cove in four fathoms water, fine sandy bottom, having run over a  shallow some four cables' length which was easily distinguished by the  colour of the water. The native who came on board was a middle-aged man,  stout and muscular, who showed no symptoms of fear. It was evident that  he had seen white men before and he often repeated the words \"blanket\"  and \"woman.\"    Grant tells us that he was much surprised at several articles on board  particularly the compasses in the binnacle. \"On my conducting him down  into the cabin and placing him before a looking-glass he expressed wonder  by innumerable gestures, attitudes and grimaces. He narrowly examined it  to see if any one was behind it; and he did not seem satisfied till I  unscrewed it from the place it was fastened to. The sound of a small  bugle horn had a very great effect on him, and he endeavoured, by  applying it to his own mouth, to make it sound, but without effect...This  stranger whom I had placed near the natives of Sydney, sat by them,  without saying a word, for about half an hour, soon after the expiration  of which time, great familiarity took place betwixt them. It appeared  evident to me that...the stranger's attention was directed to the woman,  though like the rest of her countrywomen, she was, according to our  notions, far from being possessed of any beauty: however, not only this  man, but many other natives who visited us at this place, thought her  very handsome; nor was I surprised at this when I saw some of the females  here...It appeared as if they did not readily understand each other...    \"Before we got to an anchor several canoes came round us, in one of which  was an old man whose hair had become perfectly white with age, which,  joined to his long white beard, made him a very interesting figure. The  natives appeared to pay the old man great respect and obedience of which  I saw more afterwards...I admitted some of the natives on board but the  old man could not be prevailed on to be of the party. They all testified  much surprise at what they saw.\"    The natives of Jervis Bay seemed to be stronger and more athletic than  those at Sydney, and in the management of their canoes--they differed  from any Grant had ever seen, \"particularly in paddling, sometimes making  use of an oval piece of bark, and at others, of their hands, sending the  canoe along very swiftly by either means. When paddling with the hand  they were apt to throw more or less water into the canoe, which, with a  small calabash, they dexterously threw out by a backward motion of the  other hand without turning their heads.\" At one end of their canoes he  observed two or three wooden pins which he thought were designed to  steady their fish-gigs or to receive the heads of their spears.    He tells how the sailors clipped their beards: \"From observing the  smoothness of our chins, they all expressed a desire to have theirs the  same, which some of my people instantly set about, clipping them close  with scissors. Not seeing any of these people painted, I was desirous of  knowing if they were addicted to it. I accordingly got some red paint  which as soon as one of them saw, he immediately made signs for me to rub  his nose with it. About our settlements they are often seen with their  noses painted with a red gum. They likewise form a circle nearly round  their eyes with a whitish clay. The latter, it is said, is by way of  mourning for the death of a friend...The women also paint their noses  red, and their breasts with a streak of red and white alternately. Having  occasion to leave the deck for a while, one of my young men (who had  contrived to get hold of some of the vessel's paint pots) very  deliberately painted the man (whose nose I had rubbed with red paint)  with different colours from head to foot while he grinned his approbation  at his own motley appearance. His comrades seemed to enjoy it as much as  he did and they quitted the vessel in great glee.\"    \"The Lady Nelson lay abreast of a fine sandy beach suitable for hauling  the seine, and the commander's party, which included Mr. Barrallier and  the Sydney native, went on shore. A number of blacks immediately  surrounded Euranabie and began to converse with him, using many words  that seemed to resemble the Sydney dialect, such as 'Bail,' which Grant  says signified 'No,' and 'Maun' to take off or carry away. These natives,  when the seine was hauled, showed their delight by gathering round and  giving their assistance unsolicited. A few large whiting were caught, and  except three that were kept back for the white party, were distributed  among them.    \"Shortly afterwards, other natives arrived who also wished to have some  fish, so the nets were cast a second time, and the whole of the catch was  handed to them without division.\"    Their number was so considerable that it was believed that many more were  concealed in the bushes...They were all perfectly naked except one young  fellow who had a bunch of grass fastened round his waist which came up  behind like the tail of a kangaroo. He was very merry, and from his  gestures, possessed a keen sense of humour. \"He would throw himself into  a thousand antic shapes, and afforded no small entertainment.\"    \"Having sent the boat on board with the seine,\" continues Grant, \"I was  anxious to get some kangaroos which, from the appearance of the shore, I  made no doubt were to be found in plenty. I made signs to the natives for  that purpose, and one of them offered his services. We walked towards the  end of the beach we were then on, and entered the woods. We saw several  parrots and smaller birds of beautiful plumage. Mr. Barrallier fired at  one of the latter, which so frightened our guide that he took to his  heels and ran back to his companions.\"    In this excursion the explorers were impressed by the silent grandeur of  the forest trees: there was no underwood, but there was excellent grass,  from which sprang coveys of quail, or partridges of New Holland.    The trees in general were the tall she-oak so common in the neighbourhood  of Sydney.* (* Casuarina suberosa, commonly known as Beefwood.) Grant  returned to the beach and went on board to dinner. In the afternoon he  again made a party for the shore, consisting of Mr. Barrallier, Mr.  Caley, botanist, and two soldiers. They entered the woods at the same  place as before, intending to make a circuit back to the boat. Again,  beautiful birds were seen, among them, some cockatoos which were  perfectly black \"excepting the breast and a few feathers on the wing  which were yellow.\" They were so shy that no one could get near them.  Other birds were killed--whose flesh, when cooked, was very palatable;  that of the parrot resembled our pigeon in taste--\"possibly because they  feed on seeds of wild plants.\"    According to Grant, \"no country in the world abounds with a greater  variety of insects. We saw numbers buzzing about the trees...Having  pursued our walk inland we fell in with a swampy land in a valley with  much brush wood; a rivulet of excellent fresh water ran briskly through  it, emptying itself in the sea near to where I had ordered our boat to  haul the seine. We found the track of the natives and fell in with  several of their gunnies or habitations. These are constructed with a few  boughs stuck up to screen them from "]]]
