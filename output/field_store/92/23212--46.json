That particular government could no longer exist for them with their  consent. In their judgment, it had become destructive of the proper ends  of all government, and so they proclaimed that the inalienable right to  liberty made it--to use the words of the Declaration--\"the right, the  duty, of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to  institute a new government.\"    In the New York Constitutional Convention of 1867, Mr. George William  Curtis defended the proposition so to amend the Constitution as to extend  the suffrage to women. In the course of his eloquent remarks he said: \"The  Chairman of the Committee asked Miss Anthony whether, if suffrage was a  natural right, it could be denied to children? Her answer seemed to me  perfectly satisfactory. She said simply, 'All that we ask is an equal and  not an arbitrary regulation. If _you_ have the right, _we_ have it.'\" To  me it seems to discredit the logical powers both of Miss Anthony and of  Mr. Curtis that one should have made this reply and the other should have  rested content with it. That was a pertinent question, and it was not  answered at all. To say \"if you have the right, we have it,\" is not to  tell whether one thinks children should have it. As a matter of fact, an  agitation of \"the rights of minors\" arose from the discussion of \"natural  right,\" and also an agitation for \"minority representation\" that is  continued to this day. Mr. Curtis added: \"The honorable Chairman would  hardly deny that to regulate the exercise of a right according to obvious  reason and experience is one thing, to deny it absolutely and forever is  another.\" To regulate a law is to abolish it, either relatively or  absolutely, for some, and to maintain it for others. When the State of New  York says that no alien who has not been naturalized shall vote, that no  boy under twenty-one shall vote, that no person resident in one town or  ward shall vote in another, that no criminal or pauper shall vote,--it  acts on the natural principle of self-defence, which contravenes the dogma  of a natural right of any one to the suffrage. On that principle it would  be impossible for the Congress to impeach a President; to forbid, as it  did, those who had been in rebellion from voting; or to deny the suffrage  to a child or to any human being. Government itself becomes impossible.  Judge Story, whom Suffrage writers claim as favorable to their cause on  other grounds, says that the right of voting has always been treated as a  granted and not a natural right, derived from and regulated by each  country according to its ideas of government. Both Federal and State  courts have decided again and again that there is no such thing as a  natural right to suffrage.    The \"consent of the governed\" certainly meant something very different to  our fathers, and to our statesmen, and to ourselves, from what it could  mean to any other government on earth. Although the phrase itself may have  been a euphemism which sprang from Jefferson's sympathy with the mighty  rumblings of feeling that preceded the French Revolution, still, it was  certainly meant that, so far as they could make it so, there should be  vastly more consenting by popular vote than had been dreamed of in the  mother country. But it did not mean that each and every individual in the  state must consent to each and every law that governed him; for not only  has no government ever been instituted which derived \"just powers\" in that  way, but none ever will be, for there never can be such unanimity. It did  not mean that every individual must consent to be governed somehow, by  some scheme of government; for its laws were carefully framed so as to  compel the external allegiance of those who never consent--the criminal  and the anarchist. It did not mean even that consent, in the sense of  agreement, was expected from a large body, or a small body, as the case  might happen, of those who held views opposed to the policies that were  controlling at any given time. It meant just what Jefferson meant in that  other dictum of his: \"The will of the majority is the natural law of every  society, and the only sure guardian of the rights of man.\" Together they  interpret each other, and are worthy of our Declaration and our Bill of  Rights.    The inalienable right to liberty in all mankind forbids the right of  anarchy in any of mankind; and the question of woman suffrage, strange as  it may appear, actually narrows itself down, as it seems to me, to the  question whether we shall have democracy or anarchy. Democratic government  is at an end when those who issue decrees are not identical with those who  can enforce those decrees.    But, after all, the claim to suffrage as a natural right has been  practically abandoned by those who first made that claim. Their next  proposition was, that it was a universal right, springing from the  necessary conditions of organized society, and so should be granted to  woman as a member of that society. They say in their Declaration: \"He  deprived her of the first right of a citizen--the elective franchise.\"  Chief Justice Waite of the United States Supreme Court decided that  citizenship carried with it no voting power or right. The same decision  has been handed down by many courts in disposing of test cases.    It seems to me quite as evident that what is now called universal manhood  suffrage does not rest upon any belief by the state that this is \"the  first right of a citizen,\" because no one doubts that if the time came  when a majority deemed that the preservation of the state depended upon  disfranchising a number of voters, they would be disfranchised although  they remained citizens. The Suffrage leaders have, in theory at least,  also abandoned the claim to suffrage on the ground of their universal  right as citizens. A proof of this is seen in the fact that at various  times they have suggested the extension of suffrage under qualification.  Among the latest that I have noticed, is an address of Mrs. Stanton's to a  Suffrage Convention, held in 1894, in which she proposed the following:  \"Resolved, that the women of New York petition the Legislature of the  State to extend the suffrage to women on an educational qualification.\"  She must therefore believe that the Legislature has the _legal_ right to  qualify it for men; and to withhold it from women is but an extension of  the right to qualify suffrage, because it only says: \"We do not consider  woman citizens qualified to be voters.\" Writing a year ago, Mrs. Stanton  said: \"It is the duty of the educated women of this Republic to protest  against the extension of the suffrage to another man until they themselves  are enfranchised!\" Thus it would appear that Mrs. Stanton does not believe  in universal suffrage. A Suffrage speaker in New York not long ago said  naively: \"We [the women, when enfranchised] will vote to withhold the  suffrage from the ignorant.\" She did not explain what would happen if the  ignorant voted not to have the suffrage withheld; nor did she appear to  realize that she was practically admitting that the present voters have  the right to withhold the suffrage from those whom _they_ consider  unfitted for it.    But it is not true that American women did not, and do not, \"consent to be  governed.\" They have always consented loyally and joyfully. From the time  of the Boston Tea Party down to the Civil War, and in such times of peace  and prosperity as were indicated by the Columbian Exposition, when the  Government formally asked the assistance of its woman citizens, they  showed their consent by their deeds, and only the suffrage faction treated  the invitation to share in the Exposition after the immemorial fashion of  a discontented element. And the Suffragists themselves consent to be  governed every time they accept the protection of the law or invoke it  against a debtor; for they thereby acknowledge its proper application to  themselves if the case were reversed.    The second count in the list of political grievances runs: \"He has  compelled her to submit to laws in the formation of which she had no  voice.\" This was not true, for the women who wrote that sentence were free  to use their voices in regard to every law they desired to affect, and  circumstances have proved that they were sure of being heard, and, if the  law were just, and for the general good, of assisting materially to  establish it. At the very time when Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia  Mott were writing that indictment against the United States Government,  Dorothea Dix was presenting a memorial to the National Congress asking for  an appropriation of five hundred thousand acres of the public lands to  endow hospitals for the indigent insane. That bill failed to pass, but in  1850 another bill, which she presented, asking for ten millions of acres,  passed the House and failed in the Senate merely for want of time to  consider it. Four years later a bill making appropriations of the ten  millions of acres to the separate States passed both houses, and President  Pierce vetoed it, because he believed the general Government had no  constitutional power to make such appropriations. She then went to the  Legislatures of the States, with the result that is so well known. Rhode  Island, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, and North  Carolina founded lunatic asylums, and the work was begun which is  culminating in the separation of the insane from the criminal, the women  from the men, in every town and county of the land. The right of petition  is not only as open to women as to men, but because of the non-partisan  character of their claims and suggestions they find quicker hearing.

Just in the nick of time.    Hunston and Toro were there both with their hands full, while the  Greeks had all their work to do to take care of the two captive girls.    Little Emily and Paquita, having now recovered from their surprise,  were lending assistance to the cause by keeping all the Greeks fully  occupied in looking after them.    And while they were thus occupied, Sunday and Dick Harvey were engaged  with Toro and Hunston.    Dick had rushed so violently upon Hunston that the latter was toppled  over, and it looked as though Harvey was about to make short work with  their old enemy.    But alas for Sunday!    The poor negro was overmatched.    His heart was good, but the weight and enormous strength of the Italian  were too much for him to vanquish.    That he had not as yet succumbed to Toro, was due only to his vastly  superior agility and activity.    It was all in vain for the Italian ruffian to try and close with him.    Sunday would not have this.    He knew that his chance lay in keeping Toro at a respectful distance.    And so he danced round him, dropping in an occasional smart rap which  goaded the Italian to fury.    \"Help!\" cried Hunston. \"Cut him down! cut him down!\"    One of the brigands rushed at Harvey knife in hand, and thus created a  momentary diversion in his favour.    Had not Harkaway just then appeared upon the scene it might have gone  hard with his comrade Dick.    Prompt, however, to act at this critical juncture, Harkaway spurred his  horse into the group and rode them down.    Then reining up, he flung himself from his horse, and went into the  melee.    \"I'm in it, Dick, old boy,\" cried Jack; \"here's one for Harkaway.\"    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Dick, in great excitement. \"A Harkaway! a Harkaway to  the rescue!\"    Toro turned to Harkaway with a cry of rage.    \"Curse you!\" he exclaimed; \"I'll have your life now, or you shall have  mine.\"    \"By all means,\" said old Jack, cheerfully.    \"Cur!\"    \"Come, now,\" said Harkaway, with subdued rage, \"I can't stand that;  take this!\"    And before Toro knew where he was, he got it.    It was not as pleasant as he could have wished when he did get it.    A devil of a thud it came upon his nose, a fair blow with Harkaway's  fist, and being delivered straight from the shoulder, it seemed to the  Italian like the kick of a donkey.    Toro shook all over.    His eyes flashed fireworks, and he was half stunned for the moment.    Harkaway's triumph was but temporary.    One of the Greeks, who was watching the conflict between these giants  of the combat in great interest, had by now crept up behind Jack, and  seizing him suddenly round the middle, hurled him to the ground.    \"Ha, ha!\" yelled Toro.    And bounding forward, he fell upon Harkaway, knife in hand.    \"At last, at last, your life is in my hands,\" he cried in fiend-like  joy.    The knife gleamed in the air.    A piercing shriek from little Emily was heard.    A cry of fear from Paquita, and suddenly the latter, disengaging  herself from her captors, bounded forward and seized Toro by the hair.    She dragged him back with all her strength, and little as it was, it  saved the life of Jack Harkaway.    Jack put forth all his strength at this most critical juncture, and  succeeded in grappling once more with his herculean opponent.    Toro lost his balance.    A moment more and he was rolling upon the ground in deadly battle with  brave Jack Harkaway.    So fierce a strife could not last long.    In the heat of the combat cries were heard encouraging Harkaway and  Harvey to fresh exertions, and up dashed the bold Monday, closely  followed by Jefferson and several gentlemen from the contessa's fete.    The Greeks now began to lose heart.    The odds were veering round to the wrong side.    Greeks can fight moderately well when they are three or four to one  Englishman, but when the numbers are equal, they do not care to provoke  hostilities.    And so they blew upon their whistles for assistance, and soon the  answering calls came in every direction, causing the gravest fears to  the Harkaway faction.    \"Hah!\" ejaculated Jefferson; \"they are coming to help you. But at least  I'll make sure of you, Master Toro.\"    The Italian did not shirk the encounter.    Toro, to do him justice, was, with all his faults, no coward.    He had felt the weight of Jefferson's arm, and he had reason to  remember it.    Yet he met his old adversary boldly.    Jefferson fell upon the huge Italian with tiger-like fury, and in spite  of his prodigious size and weight, he lifted him in his arms, swung him  round, and hurled him to the ground.    The Greeks now, seeing their leaders in such dire peril, thought of  avenging themselves by the most dastardly o| expedients.    \"Kill the girls!\" cried one of them.    The hint was caught up with avidity.    A savage yell responded to the bloodthirsty suggestion, and the lives  of the two innocent girls were in real peril.    \"Look to the girls!\" shouted Dick Harvey, who was fully occupied with  two of the Greek brigands who were pressing him closely.    There was a cheer in response to this appeal, and over went two of the  Greeks.    Jefferson too lent a hand at this juncture.    Finding himself free from Toro's attentions, for the huge Italian had  received such a desperate shaking with his fall that he was not fit for  much now, he rushed into the _melee_, and dealt out such slogging  blows that there were at least a dozen bleeding noses and black eyes  distributed amongst the bandits in rather less time than it takes to  note the fact.    The Greeks were thoroughly discouraged.    This unpleasant British mode of attack was not at all to their liking.    They could do pretty well with knives or swords, or even with firearms,  but they could only regard men who used their fists in the lights of  savages.    Gradually they retreated before the fierce onslaught of the Britishers  and their gallant Yankee ally.    This was no small triumph.    The brigands mustered at least twenty men.    Their enemies were five.    The five were Harkaway, Harvey, Jefferson, and the two negroes Sunday  and Monday.    The chicken-hearted Greeks, however, did not altogether turn tail, for  ere they could get fairly off this hardly-contested field, they  received considerable reinforcements.    About ten more Greeks put in an appearance.    A ragged, ruffianly crew, and ill armed.    The Harkaway party were not armed at all.    The Greeks fell back and made attempts to re-form in something like  good order.    But Jefferson saw the danger, and he followed them up closely.    Jack and Dick Harvey were at his heels.    Neither of our old friends were inferior to the bold Jefferson in  courage; but they did not possess his great advantages of size and  strength.    Jefferson's right arm went out like a battering ram, and each time he  struck out, down dropped his man.    At all events, the brigands did not give any particular signs of coming  up for a repetition dose.    The huge American dashed into the thick of the enemy.    The assassination of poor little Magog Brand had fired his fury, and  his charge was something terrific.    He dashed into the midst of the half cowed bandits, and swinging his  arms around him like the sails of a windmill, he \"grassed\" a man at  every stroke.    But this could not last for long.    As the Greeks grew stronger in numbers, they stood upon the defensive.    They were reassured.    They had seven-and-twenty men against the five.    The five, too, large-hearted though they were, had the two girls to  look after.    Amongst the latest comers upon the bandits' side was one man who was a  petty officer of the brigands, and he gave a few hurried commands,  which had the effect of putting Harkaway and his friends into a very  awkward predicament.    \"Load and fire,\" said the brigand, \"Shoot them all down.\"    If they could but succeed in getting a shot or two at the bold  Jefferson, or at any of the party, it would speedily be all over with  them.    But now, when individual bravery could no longer avail them, they had a  rare slice of luck.    Suddenly a rattling volley of musketry was heard, and three of the  Greeks bit the dust, while a number of cries told that several were  hit.    And then a detachment of gendarmes dashed up into the open at a  swinging trot.    And who headed this very welcome party?    Who but two youths that have been heard of before in these pages?    Who indeed but young Jack Harkaway and his friend Harry Girdwood?          CHAPTER VI.    SUNDAY RUBS OFF AN OLD SCORE--THE BRIGANDS--WHAT HAPPENED AT  THE PORTER'S LODGE--A STRANGE BLIND BEGGAR.      \"Hurrah!\"    \"Give them another.\"    \"Load again.\"    \"Another volley.\"    A rapid, irregular discharge followed, and the Greeks, with cries of  fear and rage, dropped their arms and fled precipitately, panic-stricken.    The gendarmes followed them up, and several were knocked over and  secured; and behind them the brigands had left no less than seven of  their number who had not been able to get off.    Amongst those seven were two men that it was no small gratification to  the Harkaway party to see once more in their power.    These two men were Hunston and Toro the Italian.    Sunday stood over the latter, leathering into his half insensible  carcase in a way that threatened to cover it with bruises; and at every  blow he had something fresh to say.    \"Take dat!\" he exclaimed, punching into Toro's ribs, \"you dam nigger.\"    Toro, dazed with what he had suffered in his shaking, could offer no  resistance.    \"And dere's another, you ugly tief!\" said the virtuous Sunday. \"I'll  gib you what for; you shall hab what Paddy gib the drum, you 'fernal  black skunk; I show yar what John up the orchard is, you--you Italian  organ-grinding sweep--You chestnut-munching beast!\"    Sunday had never forgotten his first acquaintance with"]]]
