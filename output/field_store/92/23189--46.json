[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#7)"],[1," the eldest brother. Johan was, as you know,  unmarried. Elizabeth, the wife of Louis, lay ill at the time, or  doubtless she would have fared the same as the rest. She has gone  with her two daughters to Haarlem, where her family live. All their  property was, of course, seized and confiscated, and the house burnt  down; for, as you know, they all lived together. Now, my friend,  I will leave you. I dare not ask you in for I know not who may be  watching us, and to entertain even the brother-in-law of men who  have been sent to the gallows might well cost a man his life in  our days.\"    Then Captain Martin's grief and passion found vent in words, and  he roundly cursed the Spaniards and their works, regardless of  who might hear him; then he entered the garden, visited the summer  house where he had so often talked with the old man and his sons,  and then sat down and gave full vent to his grief. Ned felt almost  stunned by the news; being so often away at sea he had never given  the fact that so long a time had elapsed since his mother had  received a letter from her family much thought. It had, indeed,  been mentioned before him; but, knowing the disturbed state of the  country, it had seemed to him natural enough that his uncles should  have had much to think of and trouble them, and might well have  no time for writing letters. His father's words the evening before  had for the first time excited a feeling of real uneasiness about  them, and the shock caused by the sight of the ruined house, and  the news that his grandfather, his three uncles, and one of his  aunts, had been murdered by the Spaniards, completely overwhelmed  him.    \"Let us be going, Ned,\" his father said at last; \"there is nothing  for us to do here, let us get back to our ship. I am a peaceable  man, Ned, but I feel now as if I could join the beggars of the  sea, and go with them in slaying every Spaniard who fell into their  hands. This will be terrible news for your mother, lad.\"    \"It will indeed,\" Ned replied. \"Oh, father, I wish you would let me  stay here and join the prince's bands and fight for their freedom.  There were English volunteers coming out to Brill and Flushing when  we sailed from the Thames, and if they come to fight for Holland who  have no tie in blood, why should not I who am Dutch by my mother's  side and whose relations have been murdered?\"    \"We will talk of it later on, Ned,\" his father said. \"You are young  yet for such rough work as this, and this is no common war. There  is no quarter given here, it is a fight to the death. The Spaniards  slaughter the Protestants like wild beasts, and like wild beasts  they will defend themselves. But if this war goes on till you have  gained your full strength and sinew I will not say you nay. As you  say, our people at home are ready to embark in a war for the cause  of liberty and religion, did the queen but give the word; and when  others, fired solely by horror at the Spaniards' cruelty, are ready  to come over here and throw in their lot with them, it seems to  me that it will be but right that you, who are half Dutch and have  had relatives murdered by these fiends, should come over and side  with the oppressed. If there is fighting at sea, it may be that I  myself will take part with them, and place the Good Venture at the  service of the Prince of Orange. But of that we will talk later  on, as also about yourself. When you are eighteen you will still  be full young for such work.\"    As they talked they were walking fast towards Amsterdam. \"We will  go straight on board, Ned; and I will not put my foot ashore again  before we sail. I do not think that I could trust myself to meet  a Spaniard now, but should draw my knife and rush upon him. I have  known that these things happened, we have heard of these daily  butcherings, but it has not come home to me as now, when our own  friends are the victims.\"    Entering the gate of the town they made their way straight down  to the port, and were soon on board the Good Venture where Captain  Martin retired to his cabin. Ned felt too restless and excited to  go down at present; but he told the crew what had happened, and  the exclamations of anger among the honest sailors were loud and  deep. Most of them had sailed with Captain Martin ever since he had  commanded the Good Venture, and had seen the Plomaerts when they  had come on board whenever the vessel put in at Amsterdam. The fact  that there was nothing to do, and no steps to take to revenge the  murders, angered them all the more.    \"I would we had twenty ships like our own, Master Ned,\" one of  them said. \"That would give us four hundred men, and with those we  could go ashore and hang the magistrates and the councillors and  all who had a hand in this foul business, and set their public  buildings in a flame, and then fight our way back again to the  port.\"    \"I am afraid four hundred men would not be able to do it here as  they did at Brill. There was no Spanish garrison there, and here  they have a regiment; and though the Spaniards seem to have the  hearts of devils rather than men, they can fight.\"    \"Well, we would take our chance,\" the sailor replied. \"If there was  four hundred of us, and the captain gave the word, we would show  them what English sailors could do, mates--wouldn't we?\"    \"Aye, that would we;\" the others growled in a chorus.    The next morning the work of unloading began. The sailors worked  hard; for, as one of them said, \"This place seems to smell of  blood--let's be out of it, mates, as soon as we can.\" At four in the  afternoon a lad of about Ned's age came on board. He was the son  of the merchant to whom the larger part of the cargo of the Good  Venture was consigned.    \"I have a letter that my father charged me to give into your hands,  Captain Martin. He said that the matter was urgent, and begged me  to give it you in your cabin. He also told me to ask when you think  your hold will be empty, as he has goods for you for the return  voyage.\"    \"We shall be well nigh empty by tomorrow night,\" Captain Martin  said, as he led the way to his cabin in the poop. \"The men have  been working faster than usual, for it generally takes us three  days to unload.\"    \"I do not think my father cared about that,\" the lad said when he  entered the cabin; \"it was but an excuse for my coming down here,  and he gave me the message before all the other clerks. But methinks  that the letter is the real object of my coming.\"    Captain Martin opened the letter. Thanks to his preparation for  taking his place in his father's business, he had learnt to read  and write; accomplishments by no means general among sea captains  of the time.    \"It is important, indeed,\" he said, as he glanced through the  letter. It ran as follows: \"Captain Martin,--A friend of mine,  who is one of the council here, has just told me that at the meeting  this afternoon a denunciation was laid against you for having  publicly, in the street of Vordwyk, cursed and abused his Majesty  the King of Spain, the Duke of Alva, the Spaniards, and the Catholic  religion. Some were of opinion that you should at once be arrested  on board your ship, but others thought that it were better to wait  and seize you the first time you came on shore, as it might cause  trouble were you taken from under the protection of the British  flag. On shore, they urged, no question could arise, especially  as many English have now, although the two nations are at peace,  openly taken service under the Prince of Orange.    \"I have sent to tell you this, though at no small risk to myself  were it discovered that I had done so; but as we have had dealings  for many years together, I think it right to warn you. I may say  that the counsel of those who were for waiting prevailed; but if,  after a day or two, they find that you do not come ashore, I fear  they will not hesitate to arrest you on your own vessel. Please  to destroy this letter at once after you have read it, and act as  seems best to you under the circumstances. I send this to you by  my son's hand, for there are spies everywhere, and in these days  one can trust no one.\"    \"I am much obliged to you, young sir, for bringing me this letter.  Will you thank your father from me, and say that I feel deeply  indebted to him, and will think over how I can best escape from  this strait. Give him the message from me before others, that I  shall be empty and ready to receive goods by noon on the day after  tomorrow.\"    When the lad had left, Captain Martin called in Ned and William  Peters, his first mate, and laid the case before them.    \"It is an awkward business, Captain Martin,\" Peters said. \"You  sha'n't be arrested on board the Good Venture, as long as there is  a man on board can wield a cutlass; but I don't know whether that  would help you in the long run.    \"Not at all, Peters. We might beat off the first party that came  to take me, but it would not be long before they brought up a force  against which we should stand no chance whatever. No, it is not by  fighting that there is any chance of escape. It is evident by this  that I am safe for tomorrow; they will wait at least a day to see  if I go ashore, which indeed they will make certain I shall do  sooner or later. As far as my own safety is concerned, and that  of Ned here, who, as he was with me, is doubtless included in the  denunciation, it is easy enough. We have only to get into the boat  after dark, to muffle the oars, and to row for Haarlem, which lies  but ten miles away, and has declared for the Prince of Orange. But  I do not like to leave the ship, for if they found us gone they  might seize and declare it confiscated. And although, when we got  back to England, we might lay a complaint before the queen, there  would be no chance of our getting the ship or her value from the  Spaniards. There are so many causes of complaint between the two  nations, that the seizure "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#7)"],[1,"e,\" said His Highness affably.    Breakfast over, Mr. Scobell replaced the remains of his cigar between  his lips, and turned to business.    \"Eh, Prince?\" he said.    \"Yes!\"    \"I want you, Prince,\" said Mr. Scobell, \"to help boom this place.  That's where you come in.\"    \"Sure,\" said John.    \"As to ruling and all that,\" continued Mr. Scobell, \"there isn't any to  do. The place runs itself. Some guy gave it a shove a thousand years  ago, and it's been rolling along ever since. What I want you to do is  the picturesque stunts. Get a yacht and catch rare fishes. Whoop it up.  Entertain swell guys when they come here. Have a Court--see what I  mean?--same as over in England. Go around in aeroplanes and that style  of thing. Don't worry about money. That'll be all right. You draw your  steady hundred thousand a year and a good chunk more besides, when we  begin to get a move on, so the dough proposition doesn't need to scare  you any.\"    \"Do I, by George!\" said John. \"It seems to me that I've fallen into a  pretty soft thing here. There'll be a joker in the deck somewhere, I  guess. There always is in these good things. But I don't see it yet.  You can count me in all right.\"    \"Good boy,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"And now you'll be wanting to get to the  Palace. I'll have them bring the automobile round.\"    The council of state broke up.    Having seen John off in the car, the financier proceeded to his  sister's sitting-room. Miss Scobell had breakfasted apart that morning,  by request, her brother giving her to understand that matters of state,  unsuited to the ear of a third party, must be discussed at the meal.  She was reading her _New York Herald_.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Scobell, \"he's come.\"    \"Yes, dear?\"    \"And just the sort I want. Saw the idea of the thing right away, and is  ready to go the limit. No nonsense about him.\"    \"Is he nice-looking, Bennie?\"    \"Sure. All these Mervo princes have been good-lookers, I hear, and this  one must be near the top of the list. You'll like him, Marion. All the  girls will be crazy about him in a week.\"    Miss Scobell turned a page.    \"Is he married?\"    Her brother started.    \"Married? I never thought of that. But no, I guess he's not. He'd have  mentioned it. He's not the sort to hush up a thing like that. I--\"    He stopped short. His green eyes gleamed excitedly.    \"Marion!\" he cried. \"_Marion!_\"    \"Well, dear?\"    \"Listen. Gee, this thing is going to be the biggest ever. I gotta new  idea. It just came to me. Your saying that put it into my head. Do you  know what I'm going to do? I'm going to cable over to Betty to come  right along here, and I'm going to have her marry this prince guy. Yes,  sir!\"    For once Miss Scobell showed signs that her brother's conversation  really interested her. She laid down her paper, and stared at him.    \"Betty!\"    \"Sure, Betty. Why not? She's a pretty girl. Clever too. The Prince'll  be lucky to get such a wife, for all his darned ancestors away back to  the flood.\"    \"But suppose Betty does not like him?\"    \"Like him? She's gotta like him. Say, can't you make your mind soar, or  won't you? Can't you see that a thing like this has gotta be fixed  different from a marriage between--between a ribbon-counter clerk and  the girl who takes the money at a twenty-five-cent hash restaurant in  Flatbush? This is a royal alliance. Do you suppose that when a European  princess is introduced to the prince she's going to marry, they let her  say: 'Nothing doing. I don't like the shape of his nose'?\"    He gave a spirited imitation of a European princess objecting to the  shape of her selected husband's nose.    \"It isn't very romantic, Bennie,\" sighed Miss Scobell. She was a  confirmed reader of the more sentimental class of fiction, and this  business-like treatment of love's young dream jarred upon her.    \"It's founding a dynasty. Isn't that romantic enough for you? You make  me tired, Marion.\"    Miss Scobell sighed again.    \"Very well, dear. I suppose you know best. But perhaps the Prince won't  like Betty.\"    Mr. Scobell gave a snort of disgust.    \"Marion,\" he said, \"you've got a mind like a chunk of wet dough. Can't  you understand that the Prince is just as much in my employment as the  man who scrubs the Casino steps? I'm hiring him to be Prince of Mervo,  and his first job as Prince of Mervo will be to marry Betty. I'd like  to see him kick!\" He began to pace the room. \"By Heck, it's going to  make this place boom to beat the band. It'll be the biggest kind of  advertisement. Restoration of Royalty at Mervo. That'll make them take  notice by itself. Then, biff! right on top of that, Royal  Romance--Prince Weds American Girl--Love at First Sight--Picturesque  Wedding! Gee, we'll wipe Monte Carlo clean off the map. We'll have 'em  licked to a splinter. We--It's the greatest scheme on earth.\"    \"I have no doubt you are right, Bennie,\" said Miss Scobell, \"but--\" her  voice became dreamy again--\"it's not very romantic.\"    \"Oh, shucks!\" said the schemer impatiently. \"Here, where's a cable  form?\"          CHAPTER VI    YOUNG ADAM CUPID      On a red sandstone rock at the edge of the water, where the island  curved sharply out into the sea, Prince John of Mervo sat and brooded  on first causes. For nearly an hour and a half he had been engaged in  an earnest attempt to trace to its source the acute fit of depression  which had come--apparently from nowhere--to poison his existence that  morning.    It was his seventh day on the island, and he could remember every  incident of his brief reign. The only thing that eluded him was the  recollection of the exact point when the shadow of discontent had begun  to spread itself over his mind. Looking back, it seemed to him that he  had done nothing during that week but enjoy each new aspect of his  position as it was introduced to his notice. Yet here he was, sitting  on a lonely rock, consumed with an unquenchable restlessness, a kind of  trapped sensation. Exactly when and exactly how Fate, that king of  gold-brick men, had cheated him he could not say; but he knew, with a  certainty that defied argument, that there had been sharp practise, and  that in an unguarded moment he had been induced to part with something  of infinite value in exchange for a gilded fraud.    The mystery baffled him. He sent his mind back to the first definite  entry of Mervo into the foreground of his life. He had come up from his  stateroom on to the deck of the little steamer, and there in the  pearl-gray of the morning was the island, gradually taking definite  shape as the pink mists shredded away before the rays of the rising  sun. As the ship rounded the point where the lighthouse still flashed a  needless warning from its cluster of jagged rocks, he had had his first  view of the town, nestling at the foot of the hill, gleaming white  against the green, with the gold-domed Casino towering in its midst. In  all Southern Europe there was no view to match it for quiet beauty. For  all his thews and sinews there was poetry in John, and the sight had  stirred him like wine.    It was not then that depression had begun, nor was it during the  reception at the quay.    The days that had followed had been peaceful and amusing. He could not  detect in any one of them a sign of the approaching shadow. They had  been lazy days. His duties had been much more simple than he had  anticipated. He had not known, before he tried it, that it was possible  to be a prince with so small an expenditure of mental energy. As Mr.  Scobell had hinted, to all intents and purposes he was a mere ornament.  His work began at eleven in the morning, and finished as a rule at  about a quarter after. At the hour named a report of the happenings of  the previous day was brought to him. When he had read it the state  asked no more of him until the next morning.    The report was made up of such items as \"A fisherman named Lesieur  called Carbineer Ferrier a fool in the market-place at eleven minutes  after two this afternoon; he has not been arrested, but is being  watched,\" and generally gave John a few minutes of mild enjoyment.  Certainly he could not recollect that it had ever depressed him.    No, it had been something else that had worked the mischief and in  another moment the thing stood revealed, beyond all question of doubt.  What had unsettled him was that unexpected meeting with Betty Silver  last night at the Casino.    He had been sitting at the Dutch table. He generally visited the Casino  after dinner. The light and movement of the place interested him. As a  rule, he merely strolled through the rooms, watching the play; but last  night he had slipped into a vacant seat. He had only just settled  himself when he was aware of a girl standing beside him. He got up.    \"Would you care--?\" he had begun, and then he saw her face.    It had all happened in an instant. Some chord in him, numbed till then,  had begun to throb. It was as if he had awakened from a dream, or  returned to consciousness after being stunned. There was something in  the sight of her, standing there so cool and neat and composed, so  typically American, a sort of goddess of America, in the heat and stir  of the Casino, that struck him like a blow.    How long was it since he had seen her last? Not more than a couple of  years. It seemed centuries. It all came back to him. It was during his  last winter at Harvard that they had met. A college friend of hers had  been the sister of a college friend of his. They had met several times,  but he could not recollect having taken any particular notice of her  then, beyond recognizing that she was certainly pretty. The world had  been full of pretty American girls then. But now--    He looked at her. And, as he looked, he heard America calling to him.  Mervo, by the appeal of its novelty, had caused him to forget. But now,  quite suddenly, he knew that he was homesick--and it astonished him,  the readiness "]]]
