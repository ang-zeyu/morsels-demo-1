[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#7)"],[1," Jewish communal  organisation and the incomparable affection and mutual devotion of  the home-life was the habit of charity. Charity, in the sense both of  almsgiving and of loving-kindness, was the virtue of virtues. The very  word which in the Hebrew Bible means righteousness means in Rabbinic  Hebrew charity. 'On three things the world stands,' says a Rabbi,  'on law, on public worship, and on the bestowal of loving-kindness.'    Some other concepts of Judaism and their influence on character will  be treated in a later chapter. Here a final word must be said on the  Hallowing of Knowledge.    In one of the oldest prayers of the Synagogue, repeated thrice daily,  occurs this paragraph: 'Thou dost graciously bestow on man knowledge,  and teachest mortals understanding; O let us be graciously endowed by  Thee with knowledge, understanding, and discernment. Blessed art Thou,  O Lord, gracious Giver of Knowledge.' The intellect was to be turned  to the service of the God from whom intelligence emanated. The Jewish  estimate of intellect and learning led to some unamiable contempt of the  fool and the ignoramus. But the evil tendency of identifying learning  with religion was more than mitigated by the encouragement which this  concept gave to education. The ideal was that every Jew must be a scholar,  or at all events a student. Obscurantism could not for any lengthy period  lodge itself in the Jewish camp. There was no learned caste. The fact that  the Bible and much of the most admired literature was in Hebrew made most  Jews bilingual at least. But it was not merely that knowledge was useful,  that it added dignity to man, and realised part of his possibilities.  The service of the Lord called for the dedication of the reason as well  as for the purification of the heart. The Jew had to think as well as  feel He had to serve with the mind as well as with the body. Therefore  it was that he was always anxious to justify his religion to his reason.  Maimonides devoted a large section of his _Guide_ to the explanation  of the motives of the commandments. And his example was imitated.  The Law was the expression of the Will of God, and obeyed and loved  as such. But the Law was also the expression of the Divine Reason.  Hence man had the right and the duty to examine and realise how his own  human reason was satisfied by the Law. In a sense the Jew was a quite  simple believer. But never a simpleton. '_Know_ the Lord thy God'  was the key-note of this aspect of Jewish theology.        CHAPTER V    SOME OBSERVANCES OF JUDAISM      The historical consciousness of Israel was vitalised by a unique  adaptability to present conditions. This is shown in the fidelity  with which a number of ancient festivals have been maintained through  the ages. Some of these were taken over from pre-Israelite cults. They  were nature feasts, and these are among the oldest rites of men. But,  as Maimonides wisely said eight centuries ago, religious rites depend  not so much on their origins as on the use men make of them. People who  wish to return to the primitive usages of this or that church have no  grasp of the value and significance of ceremonial. Here, at all events,  we are not concerned with origins. The really interesting thing is that  feasts, which originated in the fields and under the free heaven, were  observed and enjoyed in the confined streets of the Ghetto. The influence  of ceremonial is undying when it is bound up with a community's life. 'It  is impossible to create festivals to order. One must use those which  exist, and where necessary charge them with new meanings.' So writes  Mr. Montefiore in his _Liberal Judaism_ (p. 155).    This is precisely what has happened with the Passover, Pentecost, and  the Feast of Tabernacles. These three festivals were originally, as has  been said, nature feasts. But they became also pilgrim feasts. After the  fall of the Temple the pilgrimages to Jerusalem, of course, ceased, and  there was an end to the sacrificial rites connected with them all. The  only sense in which they can still be called pilgrim feasts is that,  despite the general laxity of Sabbath observance and Synagogue attendance,  these three celebrations are nowadays occasions on which, in spring,  summer, and autumn, a large section of the Jewish community contrives  to wend its way to places of public worship.    In the Jewish Liturgy the three feasts have special designations. They  are called respectively 'The Season of our Freedom,' 'the Season of the  Giving of our Law,' and 'the Season of our Joy.' These descriptions are  not biblical, nor are they found in this precise form until the fixation  of the Synagogue liturgy in the early part of the Middle Ages. But they  have had a powerful influence in perpetuating the hold that the three  pilgrim feasts have on the heart and consciousness of Israel. Liberty,  Revelation, Joy--these are a sequence of wondrous appeal. Now it is  easily seen that these ideas have no indissoluble connection with specific  historical traditions. True, 'Freedom' implies the Exodus; 'Revelation,'  the Sinaitic theophany; 'Joy,' the harvest merry-makings, and perhaps  some connection with the biblical narrative of Israel's wanderings in the  wilderness. But the connection, though essential for the construction of  the association, is not essential for its retention. 'The Passover,' says  Mr. Montefiore (_Liberal Judaism_, p. 155), 'practically celebrates  the formation of the Jewish people. It is also the festival of liberty. In  view of these two central features, it does not matter that we no longer  believe in the miraculous incidents of the Exodus story. They are mere  trappings which can easily be dispensed with. A festival of liberty,  the formation of a people for a religious task, a people destined to  become a purely religious community whose continued existence has no  meaning or value except on the ground of religion,--here we have ideas,  which can fitly form the subject of a yearly celebration.' Again, as  to Pentecost and the Ten Commandments, Mr. Montefiore writes: 'We do  not believe that any divine or miraculous voice, still less that God  Himself, audibly pronounced the Ten Words. But their importance lies in  themselves, not in their surroundings and origin. Liberals as well as  orthodox may therefore join in the festival of the Ten Commandments.  Pentecost celebrates the definite union of religion with morality,  the inseparable conjunction of the \"service\" of God with the \"service\"  of man. Can any religious festival have a nobler subject?' Finally, as  to tabernacles, Mr. Montefiore thus expresses himself: 'For us, to-day,  the connection with the wanderings from Egypt, which the latest [biblical]  legislators attempted, has again disappeared. Tabernacles is a harvest  festival; it is a nature festival. Should not a religion have a festival  or holy day of this kind? Is not the conception of God as the ruler and  sustainer of nature, the immanent and all-pervading spirit, one aspect of  the Divine, which can fitly be thought of and celebrated year by year?  Thus each of the three great Pentateuchal festivals may reasonably and  joyfully be observed by liberals and orthodox alike. We have no need or  wish to make a change.' And of the actual ceremonial rites connected  with the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, it is apparently only  the avoidance of leaven on the first of the three that is regarded as  unimportant. But even there Mr. Montefiore's own feeling is in favour  of the rite. 'It is,' he says, 'a matter of comparative unimportance  whether the practice of eating unleavened bread in the house for the  seven days of the Passover be maintained or not. Those who appreciate  the value of a pretty and ancient symbol, both for children and adults,  will not easily abandon the custom.'    This is surely a remarkable development. In the Christian Church it seems  that certain festivals are retaining their general hold because they  are becoming public, national holidays. But in Judaism the hold is to be  maintained precisely on the ground that there is to be nothing national  about them, they are to be reinterpreted ideally and symbolically. It  remains to be seen whether this is possible, and it is too early to  predict the verdict of experience. The process is in active incubation  in America as well as in Europe, but it cannot be claimed that the eggs  are hatched yet. On the other hand, Zionism has so far had no effect in  the opposite direction. There has been no nationalisation of Judaism as  a result of the new striving after political nationality. Many who had  previously been detached from the Jewish community have been brought back  by Zionism, but they have not been re-attached to the religion. There  has been no perceptible increase, for instance, in the number of those  who fast on the Ninth of Ab, the anniversary of the destruction of the  Temple. Hence, from these and other considerations, of which limited  space prevents the specification, it seems on the whole likely that,  as in the past so in the future, the Festivals of the Synagogue will  survive by changes in religious significance rather than by any deepening  of national association.    Except that the Synagogues are decked with flowers, while the Decalogue  is solemnly intoned from the Scroll of the Pentateuch, the Feast of  Pentecost has no ceremonial trappings even with the orthodox. Passover and  Tabernacles stand on a different footing. The abstention from leavened  bread on the former feast has led to a closely organised system of  cleansing the houses, an interminable array of rules as to food; while  the prescriptions of the Law as to the bearing of palm-branches and other  emblems, and the ordinance as to dwelling in booths, have surrounded  the Feast of Tabernacles with a considerable, if less extensive,  ceremonial. But there is this difference. The Passover is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#7)"],[1,"jawing away as if you were paid for it.  Oh, I say, by the way, who's setting the paper tomorrow?'    'Mellish, of course,' said White.    'No, he isn't,' I said. 'Shows what a lot you know about it. Mellish is  setting the Livy paper.'    'Then, who's doing this one?' asked Bradshaw.    'Yorke.'    Yorke was the master of the Upper Fifth. He generally set one of the  upper fourth book-papers.    'Certain?' said Bradshaw.    'Absolutely.'    'Thanks. That's all I wanted to know. By Jove, I advise you chaps to  read this. It's grand. Shall I read out this bit about a fight?'    'No!' we shouted virtuously, all together, though we were dying to hear  it, and we turned once more to the loathsome inanities of the second  chorus. If we had been doing Homer, we should have felt more in touch  with Bradshaw. There's a good deal of similarity, when you come to  compare them, between Homer and Haggard. They both deal largely in  bloodshed, for instance. As events proved, the Euripides paper, like  many things which seem formidable at a distance, was not nearly so bad  as I had expected. I did a fair-to-moderate paper, and Kendal and White  both seemed satisfied with themselves. Bradshaw confessed without  emotion that he had only attempted the last half of the last question,  and on being pressed for further information, merely laughed  mysteriously, and said vaguely that it would be all right.    It now became plain that he had something up his sleeve. We expressed a  unanimous desire to know what it was.    'You might tell a chap,' I said.    'Out with it, Bradshaw, or we'll lynch you,' added Kendal.    Bradshaw, however, was not to be drawn. Much of his success in the  paths of crime, both at school and afterwards, was due to his secretive  habits. He never permitted accomplices.    On the following Wednesday the marks were read out. Out of a possible  hundred I had obtained sixty--which pleased me very much indeed--White,  fifty-five, Kendal, sixty-one. The unspeakable Bradshaw's net total was  four.    Mellish always read out bad marks in a hushed voice, expressive of  disgust and horror, but four per cent was too much for him. He shouted  it, and the form yelled applause, until Ponsonby came in from the Upper  Fifth next door with Mr Yorke's compliments, 'and would we recollect  that his form were trying to do an examination'.    When order had been restored, Mellish settled his glasses and glared  through them at Bradshaw, who, it may be remarked, had not turned a  hair.    'Bradshaw,' he said, 'how do you explain this?'    It was merely a sighting shot, so to speak. Nobody was ever expected to  answer the question. Bradshaw, however, proved himself the exception to  the rule.    'I can explain, sir,' he said, 'if I may speak to you privately  afterwards.'    I have seldom seen anyone so astonished as Mellish was at these words.  In the whole course of his professional experience, he had never met  with a parallel case. It was hard on the poor man not to be allowed to  speak his mind about a matter of four per cent in a book-paper, but  what could he do? He could not proceed with his denunciation, for if  Bradshaw's explanation turned out a sufficient excuse, he would have to  withdraw it all again, and vast stores of golden eloquence would be  wasted. But, then, if he bottled up what he wished to say altogether,  it might do him a serious internal injury. At last he hit on a  compromise. He said, 'Very well, Bradshaw, I will hear what you have to  say,' and then sprang, like the cat in the poem, 'all claws', upon an  unfortunate individual who had scored twenty-nine, and who had been  congratulating himself that Bradshaw's failings would act as a sort of  lightning-conductor to him. Bradshaw worked off his explanation in  under five minutes. I tried to stay behind to listen, on the pretext of  wanting to tidy up my desk, but was ejected by request. Bradshaw  explained that his statement was private.    After a time they came out together like long-lost brothers, Mellish  with his hand on Bradshaw's shoulder. It was some small comfort to me  to remember that Bradshaw had the greatest dislike to this sort of  thing.    It was evident that Bradshaw, able exponent of the art of fiction that  he was, must have excelled himself on this occasion. I tried to get the  story out of him in the study that evening. White and Kendal assisted.  We tried persuasion first. That having failed, we tried taunts. Then we  tried kindness. Kendal sat on his legs, and I sat on his head, and  White twisted his arm. I think that we should have extracted something  soon, either his arm from its socket or a full confession, but we were  interrupted. The door flew open, and Prater (the same being our  House-master, and rather a good sort) appeared.    'Now then, now then,' he said. Prater's manner is always abrupt.    'What's this? I can't have this. I can't have this. Get up at once.  Where's Bradshaw?'    I rose gracefully to my feet, thereby disclosing the classic features  of the lost one.    'The Headmaster wants to see you at once, Bradshaw, at the School  House. You others had better find something to do, or you will be  getting into trouble.'    He and Bradshaw left together, while we speculated on the cause of the  summons.    We were not left very long in suspense. In a quarter of an hour  Bradshaw returned, walking painfully, and bearing what, to the expert's  eye, are the unmistakable signs of a 'touching up', which, being  interpreted, is corporal punishment.    'Hullo,' said White, as he appeared, 'what's all this?'    'How many?' enquired the statistically-minded Kendal. 'You'll be  thankful for this when you're a man, Bradshaw.'    'That's what I always say to myself when I'm touched up,' added Kendal.    I said nothing, but it was to me that the wounded one addressed  himself.    'You utter ass,' he said, in tones of concentrated venom.    'Look here, Bradshaw--' I began, protestingly.    'It's all through you--you idiot,' he snarled. 'I got twelve.'    'Twelve isn't so dusty,' said White, critically. 'Most I ever got was  six.'    'But why was it?' asked Kendal. 'That's what we want to know. What have  you been and gone and done?'    'It's about that Euripides paper,' said Bradshaw.    'Ah!' said Kendal.    'Yes, I don't mind telling you about it now. When Mellish had me up  after school today, I'd got my yarn all ready. There wasn't a flaw in  it anywhere as far as I could see. My idea was this. I told him I'd  been to Yorke's room the day before the exam, to ask him if he had any  marks for us. That was all right. Yorke was doing the two Unseen  papers, and it was just the sort of thing a fellow would do to go and  ask him about the marks.'    'Well?'    'Then when I got there he was out, and I looked about for the marks,  and on the table I saw the Euripides paper.'    'By Jove!' said Kendal. We began to understand, and to realize that  here was a master-mind.    'Well, of course, I read it, not knowing what it was, and then, as the  only way of not taking an unfair advantage, I did as badly as I could  in the exam. That was what I told Mellish. Any beak would have  swallowed it.'    'Well, didn't he?'    'Mellish did all right, but the rotter couldn't keep it to himself.  Went and told the Old Man. The Old Man sent for me. He was as decent as  anything at first. That was just his guile. He made me describe exactly  where I had seen the paper, and so on. That was rather risky, of  course, but I put it as vaguely as I could. When I had finished, he  suddenly whipped round, and said, \"Bradshaw, why are you telling me all  these lies?\" That's the sort of thing that makes you feel rather a  wreck. I was too surprised to say anything.'    'I can guess the rest,' said Kendal. 'But how on earth did he know it  was all lies? Why didn't you stick to your yarn?'    'And, besides,' I put in, 'where do I come in? I don't see what I've  got to do with it.'    Bradshaw eyed me fiercely. 'Why, the whole thing was your fault,' he  said. 'You told me Yorke was setting the paper.'    'Well, so he did, didn't he?'    'No, he didn't. The Old Man set it himself,' said Bradshaw, gloomily.          [6]    A SHOCKING AFFAIR      The Bradshaw who appears in the following tale is the same youth who  figures as the hero--or villain, label him as you like--of the  preceding equally veracious narrative. I mention this because I should  not care for you to go away with the idea that a waistcoat marked with  the name of Bradshaw must of necessity cover a scheming heart. It may,  however, be noticed that a good many members of the Bradshaw family  possess a keen and rather sinister sense of the humorous, inherited  doubtless from their great ancestor, the dry wag who wrote that  monument of quiet drollery, _Bradshaw's Railway Guide_. So with  the hero of my story.    Frederick Wackerbath Bradshaw was, as I have pointed out, my  contemporary at St Austin's. We were in the same House, and together we  sported on the green--and elsewhere--and did our best to turn the  majority of the staff of masters into confirmed pessimists, they in the  meantime endeavouring to do the same by us with every weapon that lay  to their hand. And the worst of these weapons were the end-of-term  examination papers. Mellish was our form-master, and once a term a  demon entered into Mellish. He brooded silently apart from the madding  crowd. He wandered through dry places seeking rest, and at intervals he  would smile evilly, and jot down a note on the back of an envelope.  These notes, collected and printed closely on the vilest paper, made up  the examination questions.    Our form read two authors a term, one Latin and one Greek. It was the  Greek that we feared most. Mellish had a sort of genius for picking out  absolutely untranslatable passages, and desiring us (in print) to  render the same with full notes.
