To a stranger the tribe is visible,  and not the gens. The instances are extremely rare, among the  American aborigines, in which the tribe embraced peoples speaking  different dialects. When such cases are found it has resulted from  the union of a weaker with a stronger tribe speaking a closely  related dialect, as the union of the Missouris with the Otoet, after  the overthrow of the former. The fact that the great body of the  aborigines were found in independent tribes illustrates the slow and  difficult growth of the idea of government under gentile institutions.  A small portion only had attained to the ultimate stage known Among  them, that of a confederacy of tribes speaking dialects of the same  stock language. A coalescence of tribes into a nation had not  occurred in any case in any part of America.    A constant tendency to disintegration, which has proved such a  hindrance to progress among savage and barbarous tribes, existed in  the elements of the gentile organization. It was aggravated by a  further tendency to divergence of speech, which was inseparable from  their social state and the large areas of their occupation. An oral  language, although remarkably persistent in its vocables, and still  more persistent in its grammatical forms, is incapable of permanence.  Separation of the people in area was followed in time by variation  in speech; and this, in turn, led to separation in interests and  ultimate independence. It was not the work of a brief period, but of  centuries of time, aggregating finally into thousands of years; and  the multiplication of the languages and dialects of the different  families of North and South America probably required for their  formation the time measured by three ethnical periods.    New tribes, as well as new gentes, were constantly forming by  natural growth, and the process was sensibly accelerated by the  great expanse of the American continent. The method was simple. In  the first place there would occur a gradual outflow of people from  some overstocked geographical center, which possessed superior  advantages in the means of subsistence. Continued from year to year,  a considerable population would thus be developed at a distance from  the original seat of the tribe In course of time the emigrants would  become distinct in interests, strangers in feeling, and, last of all,  divergent in speech. Separation and independence would follow,  although their territories were contiguous. A new tribe was thus  created. This is a concise statement of the manner in which the  tribes of the American aborigines were formed, but the statement  must be taken as general. Repeating itself from age to age in newly  acquired as well as in old areas, it must be regarded as a natural  as well as inevitable result of the gentile organization, united  with the necessities of their condition. When increased numbers  pressed upon the means of subsistence, the surplus removed to a new  seat, where they established themselves with facility, because the  government was perfect in every gens, and in any number of gentes  united in a band. Among the Village Indians the same thing repeated  itself in a slightly different manner. When a village became  overcrowded with numbers, a colony went up or down on the same  stream and commenced a new village. Repeated at intervals of time,  several such villages would appear, each independent of the other  and a self-governing body, but united in a league or confederacy for  mutual protection. Dialectic variation would finally spring up, and  thus complete their growth into tribes.    The manner in which tribes are evolved from each other can be shown  directly by examples. The fact of separation can be derived in part  from tradition, in part from the possession by each of a number of  the same gentes, and deduced in part from the relations of their  dialects. Tribes formed by the subdivisions of an original tribe  would possess a number of gentes in common, and speak dialects of  the same language. After several centuries of separation they would  still have a number of the same gentes. Thus the Hurons, now Wyandots,  have six gentes of the same name with six of the gentes of the  Seneca-Iroquois, after at least four hundred years of separation.  The Potawattamies have eight gentes of the same name with eight  among the Ojibwas, while the former have six, and the latter fourteen,  which are different, showing that new gentes have been formed in  each tribe by segmentation since their separation. A still older  offshoot from the Ojibwas, or from the common parent tribe of both,  the Miamis, have but three gentes in common with the former, namely,  the Wolf, the Loon, and the Eagle. The minute social history of the  tribes of the Ganowanian family is locked up in the life and growth  of the gentes. If investigation is ever turned strongly in this  direction, the gentes themselves would become reliable guides, in  respect to the order of separation from each other of the tribes of  the same stock.    This process of subdivision has been operating among the American  aborigines for thousands of years, until several hundred tribes have  been developed from about seventy stocks as existing in as many  families of language. Their experience, probably was but a  repetition of that of the tribes of Asia, Europe, and Africa when  they were in corresponding conditions.    From the preceding observations it is apparent that an American  Indian tribe is a very simple as well as humble organization. It  required but a few hundred, and, at most, a few thousand people to  form a tribe and place it in a respectable position in the  Ganowanian family.    It remains to present the functions and attributes of an Indian tribe,  which are contained in the following propositions:    I The possession of a territory and a name    II The exclusive possession of a dialect    III The right to invest sachems and chiefs elected by the gentes.    IV The right to depose these sachems and chiefs    V The possession of a religious faith and worship    VI A supreme government consisting of a council of chiefs    VII A head-chief of the tribe in some instances    For a discussion of these characteristics of a tribe, reference is  made to Ancient Society, pp. 113-118.    The growth of the idea of government commenced with the organization  into gentes in savagery. It reveals three great stages of  progressive development between its commencement and the institution  of political society after civilization had been attained. The first  stage was the government of a tribe by a council of chiefs elected  by the gentes. It may be called a government of one power, namely  the council. It prevailed generally among tribes in the Lower Status  of barbarism. The second stage was a government co-ordinated between  a council of chiefs and a general military commander, one  representing the civil and the other the military functions. This  second form began to manifest itself in the Lower Status of  barbarism after confederacies were formed, and it became definite in  the Middle Status. The office of general, or principal military  commander, was the germ of that of a chief executive magistrate, the  king, the emperor, and the president. It may be called a government  of two powers, namely, the council of chiefs and the general. The  third stage was the government of a people or nation by a council of  chiefs an assembly of the people, and a general military commander.  It appeared among the tribes who had attained to the Upper Status of  barbarism, such, for example, as the Homeric Greeks and the Italian  tribes of the period of Romulus. A Large increase in the number of  people united in a nation, their establishment in walled cities, and  the creation of wealth in lands and in flocks and herds, brought in  the assembly of the people as an instrument of government. The  council of chiefs, which still remained, found it necessary, no doubt,  through popular constraint, to submit the most important public  measures to an assembly of the people for acceptance or rejection;  whence the popular assembly. This assembly did not originate measures.  It was its function to adopt or reject, and its action was final.  From its first appearance it became a permanent power in the  government. The council no longer passed important public measures,  but became a preconsidering council, with power to originate and  mature public acts to which the assembly alone could give validity.  It may be called a government of three powers, namely, the  preconsidering council, the assembly of the people, and the general.  This remained until the institution of political society, when, for  example, among the Athenians, the council of chiefs became the senate,  and the assembly of the people the ecclesia or popular assembly. The  same organizations have come down to modern times in the two houses  of Parliament, of Congress, and of legislatures. In like manner the  office of general military commander, as before stated, was the germ  of the office of the modern chief executive magistrate.    Recurring to the tribe, it was limited in the numbers of the people,  feeble in strength, and poor in resources; but yet a completely  organized society. It illustrates the condition of mankind in the  Lower Status of barbarism. In the Middle Status there was a sensible  increase of numbers in a tribe, and an improved condition, but with  a continuance of gentile society without essential change. Political  society was still impossible from want of advancement. The gentes  organized into tribes remained as before, but confederacies must  have been more frequent. In some areas, as in the Valley of Mexico,  large numbers were developed under a common government, with  improvements in the arts of life, but no evidence exists of the  overthrow among them of gentile society and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#7)"],[1,"of the earth. There Odysseus dug a trench  into which he poured the blood of slain victims which he did not allow  the dead spirits to touch till Teiresias appeared. The seer told him of  the sorrows that awaited him and vaguely indicated that his death should  come upon him from the sea; he added that any spirit he allowed to touch  the blood would tell him truly all whereof he was as yet ignorant, and  that those ghosts he drove away would return to the darkness.    First arose the spirit of his dead mother Anticleia who told him that  his wife and son were yet alive and his father was living away from the  town in wretchedness.        \"For me, it was not the visitation of Apollo that took me, nor any      sickness whose corruption drove the life from my frame; rather it      was longing for thee and thy counsels and thy gentleness which      spoiled me of my spirit.\"    Thrice he tried to embrace her, and thrice the ghost eluded him, for it  was \"as a dream that had fled away from the white frame of the body\". A  procession of famous women followed, then came the wraith of Agamemnon  who told how he had been foully slain by his own wife, as faithless as  Penelope was prudent. Achilles next approached; when Odysseus tried to  console him for his early death by reminding him of the honour he had  when he was alive, he answered:        \"Speak not comfortingly of death; I would rather be a clown and a      thrall on earth to another man than rule among the departed.\"    On hearing that his son Neoptolemus had won great glory in the capture  of Troy, the spirit left him, exulting with joy that his son was worthy  of him. Ajax turned from Odysseus in anger at the loss of Achilles'  armour for the possession of which they had striven. The last figure  that came was the ghost of Heracles, though the hero himself was with  the gods in Olympus.        \"Round him was the whirr of the dead as of birds fleeing in panic.      Like to black night, with his bow ready and an arrow on the string,      he glared about him terribly, as ever intending to shoot. Over his      breast was flung a fearful belt, whereon were graven bears and lions      and fights, battles, murders and man-slayings.\"    He recognised Odysseus before he passed back to death; when a crowd of  terrifying apparitions came thronging to the trench, Odysseus fled to  his ship lest the Gorgon might be sent from the awful Queen of the dead.    Returning to Circe, he learned from her of the remaining dangers. The  first of these was the island of the Sirens, who by the marvellous  sweetness of their song charmed to their ruin all who passed. Odysseus  filled the ears of his crews with wax, bidding them to tie him to the  mast of his ship and to row hard past the temptresses in spite of his  strugglings. They then entered the dangerous strait, on one side of  which was Scylla, a dreadful monster who lived in a cave near by, on the  other was the deadly whirlpool of Charybdis. Scylla carried off six  of his men who called in vain to Odysseus to save them, stretching out  their hands to him in their last agony. From the strait they passed to  the island of Trinacria, where they found grazing the cattle of the Sun.  Odysseus had learned from both Teiresias and Circe that an evil doom  would come upon them if they touched the animals; he therefore made his  companions swear a great oath not to touch them if they landed. For  a whole month they were wind-bound in the island and ate all the  provisions which Circe had given them. At a time when Odysseus had gone  to explore the island Eurylochus persuaded his men to kill and eat; as  he returned Odysseus smelled the savour of their feast and knew that  destruction was at hand. For nine days the feasting continued. When  the ship put out to sea Zeus, in answer to the prayer of the offended  Sun-God, sent a storm which drowned all the crew and drove Odysseus back  to the dreaded strait. Escaping through it with difficulty, he drifted  helplessly over the deep and on the tenth day landed on the island of  \"the dread goddess who used human speech\", Calypso, who tended him and  kept him in captivity.    On the next day the Phaeacians loaded Odysseus with presents and landed  him on his own island while he slept. Poseidon in anger at the arrival  of the hero changed the returning Phaeacian ship into stone when it was  almost within the harbour of the city. When Odysseus awoke he failed to  recognise his own land. Athena appeared to him disguised as a shepherd,  telling him he was indeed in Ithaca:        \"Thou art witless or art come from afar, if thou enquirest about      this land. It is not utterly unknown; many know it who dwell in the      East and in the West. It is rough and unfitted for steeds, yet it is      not a sorry isle, though narrow. It hath plenteous store of corn and      the vine groweth herein. It hath alway rain and glistening dew. It      nourisheth goats and cattle and all kinds of woods and its streams      are everlasting.\"    Such is the description of the land for which Odysseus forsook Calypso's  offer of immortality. After smiling at Odysseus' pretence that he was  a Cretan Athena counselled him how to slay the suitors and hurried to  fetch Telemachus from Sparta. The poet tells why Athena loved Odysseus  more than all others.        \"Crafty would he be and a cunning trickster who surpassed thee in      wiles, though it were a god who challenged thee. We know craft      enough, both of us, for thou art by far the best of mortals in speech      and counsel and I among the gods am famed for devices and cunning.\"    Transformed by her into an old beggar, Odysseus went to the hut of  his faithful old swineherd Eumaeus; the dogs set upon him, but Eumaeus  scared them away and welcomed him to his dwelling. In spite of Odysseus'  assurance that the master would return Eumaeus, who had been often  deceived by similar words, refused to believe. Feigning himself to be  a Cretan, Odysseus saw for himself that the old servant's loyalty was  steadfast; a deft touch brings out his care for his master's substance:        \"laying a bed for Odysseus before the fire, he went out and slept      among the dogs in a cave beneath the breath of the winds.\"    By the intervention of Athena the two leading characters are brought  together. She stood beside the sleeping Telemachus in Sparta, warning  him of the ambush set for him in Ithaca and bidding him to land on a  lonely part of the coast whence he was to proceed to the hut of Eumaeus.  On his departure from Sparta an omen was interpreted by Helen to mean  that Odysseus was not far from home. As he was on the point of leaving  Pylos on the morrow a bard named Theoclymenus appealed to him for  protection, for he had slain a man and was a fugitive from justice.  Taking him on board Telemachus frustrated the ambush, landing in safety;  he proceeded to Eumaeus' hut, where Odysseus had with some difficulty  been persuaded to remain.    The dogs were the first to announce the arrival of a friend, gambolling  about him. After speaking a word of cheer to Eumaeus Telemachus enquired  who the stranger was; hearing that he was a Cretan he lamented his  inability to give him a welcome in his home owing to the insolence of  his enemies. Remembering the anxiety of his mother during his absence he  sent Eumaeus to the town to acquaint her with his arrival. Athena seized  the opportunity to reveal Odysseus to his son, transforming him to  his own shape. After a moment of utter amazement at the marvel of the  change, Telemachus ran to his father and fell upon his neck, his joy  finding expression in tears. The two then laid their plans for the  destruction of the suitors. By the time Eumaeus had returned Odysseus  had resumed his sorry and tattered appearance.    Telemachus went to the town alone, bidding Eumaeus bring the stranger  with him. They were met by one Melanthius a goatherd, who covered them  with insults. \"In truth one churl is leading another, for the god ever  bringeth like to like. Whither art thou taking this glutton, this evil  pauper, a kill-joy of the feast? He hath learned many a knavish trick  and is like to refuse to labour; creeping among the people he would  rather ask alms to fill his insatiate maw.\" Leaping on Odysseus, he  kicked at him, yet failed to stir him from the pathway. Swallowing the  insult Odysseus walked towards his house. A superb stroke of art has  created the next incident. In the courtyard lay Argus, a hound whom  Odysseus had once fed. Neglected in the absence of his master he had  crept to a dung-heap, full of lice. When he marked Odysseus coming  towards him he wagged his tail and dropped his ears, but could not come  near his lord. Seeing him from a little distance Odysseus wiped away his  tears unnoticed of Eumaeus and asked whose the hound was. Eumaeus told  the story of his neglect: \"but the doom of death took Argus straightway  after seeing Odysseus in the twentieth year\". In the palace Telemachus  sent his father food, bidding him ask a charity of the wooers. Antinous  answered by hurling a stool which struck his shoulder. The noise of the  high words which followed brought down Penelope who protested against  the godless behaviour of the suitors and asked to interview the stranger  in hope of learning some tidings of her husband, but Odysseus put her  off till nightfall when they would be less likely to suffer from the  insolence of the suitors.    In Ithaca was a beggar named Irus, gluttonous and big-boned but a  coward. Encouraged by the winkings and noddings of the suitors he bade  Odysseus begone. A quiet answer made him imagine he had to deal with  a poltroon and he challenged him to a fight. The proposal was welcomed  with glee by the suitors, who promised on oath to see fair play for  the old man in his quarrel with a younger. But when they saw the mighty  limbs and stout frame of Odysseus, they deemed that Irus had"]]]
