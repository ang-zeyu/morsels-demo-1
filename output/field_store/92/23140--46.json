Then you will feel quite safe, I  hope.\"    \"Oh, yes! quite safe, citizen!\" the woman replied with a sigh of genuine  relief. Then only did Chauvelin turn on his heel and go his way.      IX    But that crumpled and soiled scrap of paper given to him by the woman  Leridan still lay in his clenched hand as he strode back rapidly  citywards. It seemed to scorch his palm. Even before he had glanced at  the contents he knew what they were. That atrocious English doggerel,  the signature--a five-petalled flower traced in crimson! How well he  knew them!    \"We seek him here, we seek him there!\"    The most humiliating moments in Chauvelin's career were associated with  that silly rhyme, and now here it was, mocking him even when he knew  that his bitter enemy lay fettered and helpless, caught in a trap, out  of which there was no escape possible; even though he knew for a  positive certainty that the mocking voice which had spoken those rhymes  on that far-off day last September would soon be stilled for ever.    No doubt one of that army of abominable English spies had placed this  warning outside the Leridans' door. No doubt they had done that with a  view to throwing dust in the eyes of the Public Prosecutor and causing a  confusion in his mind with regard to the identity of the prisoner at the  Abbaye, all to the advantage of their chief.    The thought that such a confusion might exist, that Fouquier-Tinville  might be deluded into doubting the real personality of Paul Mole,  brought an icy sweat all down Chauvelin's spine. He hurried along the  interminably long Chemin de Pantin, only paused at the Barriere du  Combat in order to interview the Commissary of the Section on the matter  of sending men to watch over the Leridans' house. Then, when he felt  satisfied that this would be effectively and quickly done, an  unconquerable feeling of restlessness prompted him to hurry round to the  lodgings of the Public Prosecutor in the Rue Blanche--just to see him,  to speak with him, to make quite sure.    Oh! he must be sure that no doubts, no pusillanimity on the part of any  official would be allowed to stand in the way of the consummation of all  his most cherished dreams. Papers or no papers, testimony or no  testimony, the incarcerated Paul Mole was the Scarlet Pimpernel--of this  Chauvelin was as certain as that he was alive. His every sense had  testified to it when he stood in the narrow room of the Rue des  Cordeliers, face to face--eyes gazing into eyes--with his sworn enemy.    Unluckily, however, he found the Public Prosecutor in a surly and  obstinate mood, following on an interview which he had just had with  citizen Commissary Cuisinier on the matter of the prisoner Paul Mole.    \"His papers are all in order, I tell you,\" he said impatiently, in  answer to Chauvelin's insistence. \"It is as much as my head is worth to  demand a summary execution.\"    \"But I tell you that, those papers of his are forged,\" urged Chauvelin  forcefully.    \"They are not,\" retorted the other. \"The Commissary swears to his own  signature on the identity book. The concierge at the Abbaye swears that  he knows Mole, so do all the men of the Surete who have seen him. The  Commissary has known him as an indigent, good-for-nothing lubbard who  has begged his way in the streets of Paris ever since he was released  from gaol some months ago, after he had served a term for larceny. Even  your own man Hebert admits to feeling doubtful on the point. You have  had the nightmare, citizen,\" concluded Fouquier-Tinville with a harsh  laugh.    \"But, name of a dog!\" broke in Chauvelin savagely. \"You are not  proposing to let the man go?\"    \"What else can I do?\" the other rejoined fretfully. \"We shall get into  terrible trouble if we interfere with a man like Paul Mole. You know  yourself how it is these days. We should have the whole of the rabble of  Paris clamouring for our blood. If, after we have guillotined him, he is  proved to be a good patriot, it will be my turn next. No! I thank you!\"    \"I tell you, man,\" retorted Chauvelin desperately, \"that the man is not  Paul Mole--that he is the English spy whom we all know as the Scarlet  Pimpernel.\"    \"EH BIEN!\" riposted Fouquier-Tinville. \"Bring me more tangible proof  that our prisoner is not Paul Mole and I'll deal with him quickly  enough, never fear. But if by to-morrow morning you do not satisfy me on  the point ... I must let him go his way.\"    A savage oath rose to Chauvelin's lips. He felt like a man who has been  running, panting to reach a goal, who sees that goal within easy  distance of him, and is then suddenly captured, caught in invisible  meshes which hold him tightly, and against which he is powerless to  struggle. For the moment he hated Fouquier-Tinville with a deadly  hatred, would have tortured and threatened him until he wrung a consent,  an admission, out of him.    Name of a name! when that damnable English spy was actually in his  power, the man was a pusillanimous fool to allow the rich prize to slip  from his grasp! Chauvelin felt as if he were choking; his slender  fingers worked nervily around his cravat; beads of perspiration trickled  unheeded down his pallid forehead.    Then suddenly he had an inspiration--nothing less! It almost seemed as  if Satan, his friend, had whispered insinuating words into his ear. That  scrap of paper! He had thrust it awhile ago into the breast pocket of  his coat. It was still there, and the Public Prosecutor wanted a  tangible proof.... Then, why not....?    Slowly, his thoughts still in the process of gradual coordination,  Chauvelin drew that soiled scrap of paper out of his pocket.  Fouquier-Tinville, surly and ill-humoured, had his back half-turned  towards him, was moodily picking at his teeth. Chauvelin had all the  leisure which he required. He smoothed out the creases in the paper and  spread it out carefully upon the desk close to the other man's elbow.  Fouquier-Tinville looked down on it, over his shoulder.    \"What is that?\" he queried.    \"As you see, citizen,\" was Chauvelin's bland reply. \"A message, such as  you yourself have oft received, methinks, from our mutual enemy, the  Scarlet Pimpernel.\"    But already the Public Prosecutor had seized upon the paper, and of a  truth Chauvelin had no longer cause to complain of his colleague's  indifference. That doggerel rhyme, no less than the signature, had the  power to rouse Fouquier-Tinville's ire, as it had that of disturbing  Chauvelin's well-studied calm.    \"What is it?\" reiterated the Public Prosecutor, white now to the lips.    \"I have told you, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin imperturbably. \"A message  from that English spy. It is also the proof which you have demanded of  me--the tangible proof that the prisoner, Paul Mole, is none other than  the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"    \"But,\" ejaculated the other hoarsely, \"where did you get this?\"    \"It was found in the cell which Paul Mole occupied in the depot of the  Rue de Tourraine, where he was first incarcerated. I picked it up there  after he was removed ... the ink was scarcely dry upon it.\"    The lie came quite glibly to Chauvelin's tongue. Was not every method  good, every device allowable, which would lead to so glorious an end?    \"Why did you not tell me of this before?\" queried Fouquier-Tinville,  with a sudden gleam of suspicion in his deep-set eyes.    \"You had not asked me for a tangible proof before,\" replied Chauvelin  blandly. \"I myself was so firmly convinced of what I averred that I had  well-nigh forgotten the existence of this damning scrap of paper.\"    Damning indeed! Fouquier-Tinville had seen such scraps of paper before.  He had learnt the doggerel rhyme by heart, even though the English  tongue was quite unfamiliar to him. He loathed the English--the entire  nation--with all that deadly hatred which a divergence of political aims  will arouse in times of acute crises. He hated the English government,  Pitt and Burke and even Fox, the happy-go-lucky apologist of the young  Revolution. But, above all, he hated that League of English spies--as he  was pleased to call them--whose courage, resourcefulness, as well as  reckless daring, had more than once baffled his own hideous schemes of  murder, of pillage, and of rape.    Thank Beelzebub and his horde of evil spirits, citizen Chauvelin had  been clear-sighted enough to detect that elusive Pimpernel under the  disguise of Paul Mole.    \"You have deserved well of your country,\" said Tinville with lusty  fervour, and gave Chauvelin a vigorous slap on the shoulder. \"But for  you I should have allowed that abominable spy to slip through our  fingers.\"    \"I have succeeded in convincing you, citizen?\" Chauvelin retorted dryly.    \"Absolutely!\" rejoined the other. \"You may now leave the matter to me.  And 'twill be friend Mole who will be surprised to-morrow,\" he added  with a harsh guffaw, \"when he finds himself face to face with me, before  a Court of Justice.\"    He was all eagerness, of course. Such a triumph for him! The indictment  of the notorious Scarlet Pimpernel on a charge of espionage would be the  crowning glory of his career! Let other men look to their laurels! Those  who brought that dangerous enemy of revolution to the guillotine would  for ever be proclaimed as the saviours of France.    \"A short indictment,\" he said, when Chauvelin, after a lengthy  discussion on various points, finally rose to take his leave, \"but a  scathing one! I tell you, citizen Chauvelin, that to-morrow you will be  the first to congratulate me on an unprecedented triumph.\"    He had been arguing in favour of a sensational trial and no less"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker — or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#7)"],[1,"e. He is a splendid  man that--we class him No. 1, letter A. One night I  chanced to go into General Peep's tavern at Boston, and  who should I see there but the great Mr. Everett, a  studying over a map of the Province of Nova-Scotia. Why  it aint possible! said I--if that aint Professor Everett,  as I am alive! why how do you do, Professor? Pretty well,  I give you thanks, said he; how be you? but I aint no  longer Professor; I gin that up, and also the trade of  Preaching, and took to politics. You don't say so, said  I; why what on airth is the cause o' that? Why, says he,  look here, Mr. Slick. What IS the use of reading the  Proverbs of Solomon to our free and enlightened citizens,  that are every mite and mortal as wise as he was? That  are man undertook to say there was nothing new under the  sun. I guess he'd think he spoke a little too fast, if  he was to see our steam boats, rail-roads, and India  rubber shoes--three inventions worth more nor all he knew  put in a heap together. Well, I don't know, said I, but  somehow or another, I guess you'd have found preaching  the best speculation in the long run; them are Unitarians  pay better than Uncle Sam (we call, said the Clockmaker,  the American public Uncle Sam, as you call the British  John Bull.)    That remark seemed to grig him a little; he felt oneasy  like, and walked twice across the room, fifty fathoms  deep in thought: at last he said, which way are you from,  Mr. Slick, this hitch? Why, says I, I've been away up  south a speculating in nutmegs. I hope, says the Professor,  they were a good article, the real right down genuine  thing. No mistake, says I,--no mistake, Professor: they  were all prime, first chop, but why did you ax that are  question? Why, says he, that eternal scoundrel, that  Captain John Allspice of Nahant, he used to trade to  Charleston, and he carried a cargo once there of fifty  barrels of nutmegs: well, he put half a bushel of good  ones into each eend of the barrel, and the rest he filled  up with wooden ones, so like the real thing, no soul  could tell the difference until HE BIT ONE WITH HIS TEETH,  and that he never thought of doing, until he was first  BIT HIMSELF. Well, its been a standing joke with them  southerners agin us ever since. It was only tother day  at Washington, that everlasting Virginy duellist General  Cuffy, afore a number of senators, at the President's  house, said to me, 'Well Everett,' says he--'you know I  was always dead agin your Tariff bill, but I have changed  my mind since your able speech on it; I shall vote for  it now.' 'Give me your hand,' says I, 'General Cuffy;  the Boston folks will be dreadful glad when they hear  your splendid talents are on our side--I think it will  go now--we'll carry it.' 'Yes,' says he, 'your factories  down east beat all natur; they go ahead on the English  a long chalk.' You may depend I was glad to hear the New  Englanders spoken of that way--I felt proud I tell  you--'and,' says he, 'there's one manufacture that might  stump all Europe to produce the like.' 'What's that?'  says I, looking as pleased all the time as a gall that's  tickled. 'Why,' says be, 'the facture of wooden nutmegs;  that's a cap sheef that bangs the bush--its a real Yankee  patent invention.' With that all the gentlemen set up a  laugh, you might have heard away down to Sandy Hook--and  the General gig gobbled like a great turkey cock, the  half nigger, half alligator like looking villain as he  is. I tell you what, Mr. Slick, said the Professor, I  wish with all my heart them are damned nutmegs were in  the bottom of the sea. That was the first oath I ever  heerd him let slip: but he was dreadful ryled, and it  made me feel ugly too, for its awful to hear a minister  swear; and the only match I know for it, is to hear a  regular sneezer of a sinner quote scripture. Says I, Mt.  Everett, that's the fruit that politics bear; for my part  I never seed a good graft on it yet, that bore any thing  good to eat, or easy to digest.    Well, he stood awhile looking down on the carpet, with  his hands behind him, quite taken up a cyphering in his  head, and then he straightened himself up, and he put  his hand upon his heart, just as he used to do in the  pulpit, (he looked pretty I tell you) and slowly lifting  his hand off his breast, he said, 'Mr. Slick, our tree  of liberty was a beautiful tree--a splendid tree--it  was a sight to look at; it was well fenced and well  protected, and it grew so stately and so handsome, that  strangers came from all parts of the globe to see it.  They all allowed it was the most splendid thing in the  world. Well, the mobs have broken in and tore down the  fences, and snapped off the branches, and scattered all  the leaves about, and it looks no better than a gallows  tree.' 'I am afeared,' said he, 'I tremble to think on  it, but I am afeared our ways will no longer be ways of  pleasantness, nor our paths, paths of peace; I am, indeed,  I vow, Mr. Slick.' He looked so streaked and so chop-fallen,  that I felt kinder sorry for him; I actilly thought he'd  a boo-hood right out. So, to turn the conversation, says  I, Professor, what are great map is that I seed you a  studyin' over when I came in? Says he, it's a map of Nova  Scotia. That, says he, is a valuable province, a real  clever province; we hant got the like on it, but its most  plagily in our way. Well, says I, send for Sam Patch  (that are man was a great diver, says the Clockmaker,  and the last dive he took was off the falls of Niagara,  and he was never heerd of agin till tother day, when  Captain Enoch Wentworth, of the Susy Ann Whaler, saw him  in the South Sea. Why, says Capt. Enoch to him, why Sam,  says he, how on airth did you get here? I thought you  was drowned at the Canadian lines. Why, says he, I didn't  get ON airth here at all, but I came right slap THROUGH  it. In that are Niagara dive, I went so everlasting deep,  I thought it was just as short to come up tother side,  so out I came in those parts. If I don't take the shine  off the Sea Serpent, when I get back to Boston, then my  name's not Sam Patch.)    Well, says I, Professor, send for Sam Patch, the diver,  and let him dive down and stick a torpedo in the bottom  of the Province and blow it up; or if that won't do, send  for some of our steam tow boats from our great Eastern  cities, and tow it out to sea; you know there's nothing  our folks can't do, when they once fairly take hold on  a thing in airnest. Well, that made him laugh; he seemed  to forget about the nutmegs, and says he, that's a bright  scheme, but it won't do; we shall want the Province some  day, and I guess we'll buy it of King William; they say  he is over head and ears in debt, and owes nine hundred  millions of pounds starling--we'll buy it, as we did  Florida. In the meantime we must have a canal from Bay  Fundy to Bay Varte, right through Cumberland neck, by  Shittyack, for our fishing vessels to go to Labradore.  I guess you must ax leave first, said I; that's jist what  I was cyphering at, says he, when you came in. I believe  we won't ax them at all, but jist fall to and do it; ITS  A ROAD OF NEEDCESSITY. I once heard Chief Justice Marshall  of Baltimore say; 'If the people's highway is dangerous  --a man may take down a fence--and pass through the fields  as a way of NEEDCESSITY;' and we shall do it on that  principle, as the way round by Isle Sable is dangerous.  I wonder the Novascotians don't do it for their own  convenience. Said I, it would'nt make a bad speculation  that. The critters don't know no better, said he.    Well, says I, the St. John's folks, why don't they? for  they are pretty cute chaps them. They remind me, says  the Professor, of Jim Billings. You knew Jim Billings,  did'nt you, Mr. Slick? Oh yes, said I, I knew him. It  was he that made such a talk by shipping blankets to the  West Indies; the same, says he. Well, I went to see him  the other day at Mrs. Lecain's Boarding House, and says  I, Billings, you have a nice location here. A plaguy  sight too nice, said he. Marm Lecain makes such an etarnal  touss about her carpets, that I have to go along that  everlasting long entry, and down both staircases, to the  street door to spit; and it keeps all the gentlemen a  running with their mouths full all day. I had a real bout  with a New Yorker this morning, I run down to the street  door, and afore I see'd any body a coming, I let go, and  I vow if I did'nt let a chap have it all over his white  waistcoat. Well, he makes a grab at me, and I shuts the  door right to on his wrist, and hooks the door chain  taught and leaves him there, and into Marm Lecain's bed  room like a shot, and hides behind the curtain. Well, he  roared like a bull, till black Lucretia, one of the house  helps, let him go, and they looked into all the gentlemen's  rooms and found nobody--so I got out of that are scrape.  So, what with Marm Lecain's carpets in the house, and  other folks' waistcoats in the street, its too nice a  location for me, I guess, so I shall up killoch and off  to morrow to the TREE-mont.    Now, says the Professor, the St. John's folks are jist  like Billings, fifty cents would have bought him a spit  box, and saved him all them are journeys to the street  door--and a canal at Bay Varte would save the St. John's  folks a voyage all round Nova-Scotia. Why, they can't  get at their own backside settlements, without a voyage  most as long as one to Europe. If we had that are neck  of land in Cumberland, we'd have a ship canal there, and  a town at each end of it as big as Portland. You may  talk of Solomon, said the Professor, but if Solomon in  all his glory was not arrayed like a lily of the field,  neither was he in all his wisdom, equal in knowledge to  a reel free American citizen. Well, said I, Professor,  we are a most enlightened people, that's sartain, but  somehow I don't like to hear you run down King Solomon  neither;"]]]
