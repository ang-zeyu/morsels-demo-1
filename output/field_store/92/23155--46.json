He expects it,  as a matter of course, and as every female is a lady, every woman has  a right to ask you to quit, without notice, for her accommodation. Now  it's all very well and very proper to be respectful to preachers; and  to be polite and courteous to women, and more especially those that  are unprotected; but there is a limit, tother side of which lies  absurdity.    \"Now if you had seen as much of the world as I have, and many other  travelled Yankees, when bonnet man asked you to give up your seat to  the maid, you would have pretended not to understand English, and not  to know what he wanted, but would have answered him in French and  offered him the book, and said certainly you would give it to him with  pleasure, and when he said he didn't speak French, but what he desired  was your place for the lady, you would have addressed her in German,  and offered her the book, and when they looked at each other, and  laughed at their blunder, in thus taking you for a Yankee, perhaps the  man next to you would have offered his seat, and then when old bonnet  man walked off to look at the Chinese Junk, you would have entered  into conversation with the lady's-maid, and told her it was a rise you  took out of the old fellow to get her along-side of you, and she would  enjoy the joke, and you would have found her a thousand times more  handsome and more conversational and agreeable than her mistress.    \"But this wouldn't last long, for the sick gall would be carried up on  deck agin, woman like, though ill, very restless, and chock full of  curiosity to see the Chinese Junk also; so you are caught by your own  bam, and have to move again once more. The bell comes in aid, and  summons you to dinner. Ah, the scene in the Tower of Babel is  rehearsed; what a confusion of tongues! what a clatter of knives and  forks and dishes! the waiter that goes and won't come back; and he who  sees, pities but can't help you; and he who is so near sighted, he  can't hear; and he who is intercepted, and made prisoner on his way.    \"What a profusion of viands--but how little to eat! this is cold; that  under-done; this is tough; that you never eat; while all smell oily;  oh, the only dish you did fancy, you can't touch, for that horrid  German has put his hand into it. But it is all told in one short  sentence; two hundred and fifty passengers supply two hundred and  fifty reasons themselves, why I should prefer a sailing vessel with a  small party to a crowded steamer. If you want to see them in  perfection go where I have been it on board the California boats, and  Mississippi river crafts. The French, Austrian, and Italian boats are  as bad. The two great Ocean lines, American and English, are as good  as anything bad can be, but the others are all abominable. They are  small worlds over-crowded, and while these small worlds exist, the  evil will remain; for alas, their passengers go backward and forward,  they don't emigrate--they migrate; they go for the winter and return  for the spring, or go in the spring and return in the fall.    \"Come, Commodore, there is old Sorrow ringing his merry bell for us to  go to dinner. I have an idea we shall have ample room; a good  appetite, and time enough to eat and enjoy it: come, Sir, let us, like  true Americans, never refuse to go where duty calls us.\"    After dinner, Cutler reverted to the conversation we had had before we  went below, though I don't know that I should call it conversation,  either; for I believe I did, as usual, most of the talking myself.    \"I agree with you,\" said he, \"in your comparative estimate of a  sailing vessel and a steamer, I like the former the best myself. It is  more agreeable for the reasons you have stated to a passenger, but it  is still more agreeable to the officer in command of her on another  account. In a sailing vessel, all your work is on deck, everything is  before you, and everybody under your command. One glance of a seaman's  eye is sufficient to detect if anything is amiss, and no one man is  indispensable to you. In a steamer the work is all below, the  machinery is out of your sight, complicated, and one part dependent on  another. If it gets out of order you are brought up with a round turn,  all standing, and often in a critical situation too. You can't repair  damage easily; sometimes, can't repair at all.    \"Whereas carrying away a sail, a spar, a topmast, or anything of that  kind, impedes but don't stop you, and if it is anything very serious  there are a thousand ways of making a temporary rig that will answer  till you make a port. But what I like best is, when my ship is in the  daldrums, I am equal to the emergency; there is no engineer to bother  you by saying this can't be done, or that won't do, and to stand  jawing and arguing instead of obeying and doing. Clippers of the right  lines, size, and build, well found, manned, and commanded, will make  nearly as good work, in ordinary times, as steamers. Perhaps it is  prejudice though, for I believe we sailors are proverbial for that.  But, Slick, recollect it ain't all fair weather sailing like this at  sea. There are times when death stares you wildly in the face.\"    \"Exactly,\" sais I, \"as if he would like to know you the next time he  came for you, so as not to apprehend the wrong one. He often leaves  the rascal and seizes the honest man; my opinion is, he don't see very  well.\"    \"What a droll fellow you are,\" said he; \"it appears to me as if you  couldn't be serious for five minutes at a time. I can tell you, if you  were on a rocky lee-shore, with the wind and waves urging you on, and  you barely holding your own, perhaps losing ground every tack, you  wouldn't talk quite so glibly of death. Was you ever in a real heavy  gale of wind?\"    \"Warn't I,\" said I; \"the fust time I returned from England it blew  great guns all the voyage, one gale after another, and the last always  wuss than the one before. It carried away our sails as fast as we bent  them.\"    \"That's nothing unusual,\" said Cutler; \"there are worse things than  that at sea.\"    \"Well, I'll tell you,\" sais I, \"what it did; and if that ain't an  uncommon thing, then my name ain't Sam Slick. It blew all the hair off  my dog, except a little tuft atween his ears. It did, upon my soul. I  hope I may never leave--\"    \"Don't swear to it, Slick,\" said he, \"that's a good fellow. It's  impossible.\"    \"Attestin' to it will make your hair stand on eend too, I suppose,\"  said I; \"but it's as true as preachin' for all that. What will you bet  it didn't happen?\"    \"Tut, man, nonsense,\" said he, \"I tell you the thing is impossible.\"    \"Ah!\" said I, \"that's because you have been lucky, and never saw a  riprorious hurricane in all your life. I'll tell you how it was. I  bought a blood-hound from a man in Regent's Park, just afore I sailed,  and the brute got sea-sick, and then took the mange, and between that  and death starin' him in the face, his hair all came off, and in  course it blew away. Is that impossible?\"    \"Well, well,\" said he, \"you have the most comical way with you of any  man I ever see. I am sure it ain't in your nature to speak of death in  that careless manner, you only talked that way to draw me out. I know  you did. It's not a subject however to treat lightly, and if you are  not inclined to be serious just now, tell us a story.\"    \"Serious,\" sais I, \"I am disposed to be; but not sanctimonious, and  you know that. But here goes for a story, which has a nice little  moral in it too.    \"'Once on a time, when pigs were swine, and turkeys chewed tobacco,  and little birds built their nests in old men's beards.'    \"Pooh!\" said he, turning off huffy like, as if I was a goin' to bluff  him off. \"I wonder whether supper is ready?\"    \"Cutler,\" sais I, \"come back, that's a good fellow, and I'll tell you  the story. It's a short one, and will just fill up the space between  this and tea-time. It is in illustration of what you was a sayin',  that it ain't always fair weather sailing in this world. There was a  jack-tar once to England who had been absent on a whaling voyage for  nearly three years, and he had hardly landed when he was ordered off  to sea again, before he had time to go home and see his friends. He  was a lamentin' this to a shipmate of his, a serious-minded man, like  you.    \"Sais he, 'Bill, it breaketh my heart to have to leave agin arter this  fashion. I havn't seen Polly now goin' on three years, nor the little  un either.' And he actilly piped his eye.    \"'It seemeth hard, Tom,' said Bill, tryin' to comfort him; 'it seemeth  hard; but I'm an older man nor you be, Tom, the matter of several  years;' and he gave his trowsers a twitch (you know they don't wear  galluses, though a gallus holds them up sometimes), shifted his quid,  gave his nor'wester a pull over his forehead, and looked solemncholly,  'and my experience, Tom, is, that this life ain't all beer and  skittles.'    \"Cutler, there is a great deal of philosophy in that maxim: a preacher  couldn't say as much in a sermon an hour long, as there is in that  little story with that little moral reflection at the eend of it.    \"'This life ain't all leer and skittles.' Many a time since I heard  that anecdote--and I heard it in Kew Gardens, of all places in the  world--when I am disappointed sadly, I say that saw over, and console  myself with it. I can't expect to go thro' the world, Cutler, as I  have done: stormy days, long and dark nights, are before me. As I grow  old I shan't be so full of animal spirits as I have been. In the natur  of things I must have my share of aches, and pains, and  disappointment, as well as others; and when they come, nothing will  better help me to bear them than that little simple reflection of the  sailor, which appeals so directly to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#7)"],[1,"be happy. And permit me, on my bended knees, to thank you for all the  benefits and favours you have heaped upon me; for the opportunities I  have had of improvement and learning, through my good lady's means, and  yours. I will now forget all your honour has offered me: and I promise  you, that I will never let your name pass my lips, but with reverence  and gratitude: and so God Almighty bless your honour, for ever and ever!  Amen.    Then rising from my knees, I went away with another-guise sort of  heart than I came into his presence with: and so I fell to writing this  letter. And thus all is happily over.    And now, my dearest father and mother, expect to see soon your poor  daughter, with an humble and dutiful mind, returned to you: and don't  fear but I know how to be as happy with you as ever: for I will be in  the loft, as I used to do; and pray let my little bed be got ready; and  I have a small matter of money, which will buy me a suit of clothes,  fitter for my condition than what I have; and I will get Mrs. Mumford  to help me to some needle-work: and fear not that I shall be a burden  to you, if my health continues. I know I shall be blessed, if not for  my own sake, for both your sakes, who have, in all your trials and  misfortunes, preserved so much integrity as makes every body speak  well of you both. But I hope he will let good Mrs. Jervis give me a  character, for fear it should be thought that I was turned away for  dishonesty.    And so, my dear parents, may you be blest for me, and I for you! And I  will always pray for my master and Mrs. Jervis. So good night; for it is  late, and I shall be soon called to bed.    I hope Mrs. Jervis is not angry with me. She has not called me to  supper: though I could eat nothing if she had. But I make no doubt I  shall sleep purely to-night, and dream that I am with you, in my dear,  dear, happy loft once more.    So good night again, my dear father and mother, says                                              Your poor honest DAUGHTER.    Perhaps I mayn't come this week, because I must get up the linen, and  leave in order every thing belonging to my place. So send me a line, if  you can, to let me know if I shall be welcome, by John, who will call  for it as he returns. But say nothing of my coming away to him, as yet:  for it will be said I blab every thing.          LETTER XVII      MY DEAREST DAUGHTER,    Welcome, welcome, ten times welcome shall you be to us; for you come  to us innocent, and happy, and honest; and you are the staff of our old  age, and our comfort. And though we cannot do for you as we would, yet,  fear not, we shall live happily together; and what with my diligent  labour, and your poor mother's spinning, and your needle-work, I make no  doubt we shall do better and better. Only your poor mother's eyes begin  to fail her; though, I bless God, I am as strong and able, and willing  to labour as ever; and, O my dear child! your virtue has made me, I  think, stronger and better than I was before. What blessed things are  trials and temptations, when we have the strength to resist and subdue  them!    But I am uneasy about those same four guineas; I think you should give  them back again to your master; and yet I have broken them. Alas! I have  only three left; but I will borrow the fourth, if I can, part upon my  wages, and part of Mrs. Mumford, and send the whole sum back to you,  that you may return it, against John comes next, if he comes again  before you.    I want to know how you come. I fancy honest John will be glad to bear  you company part of the way, if your master is not so cross as to forbid  him. And if I know time enough, your mother will go one five miles, and  I will go ten on the way, or till I meet you, as far as one holiday will  go; for that I can get leave to make on such an occasion.    And we shall receive you with more pleasure than we had at your birth,  when all the worst was over; or than we ever had in our lives.    And so God bless you till the happy time comes! say both your mother and  I, which is all at present, from                                   Your truly loving PARENTS.          LETTER XVIII      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I thank you a thousand tines for your goodness to me, expressed in your  last letter. I now long to get my business done, and come to my new old  lot again, as I may call it. I have been quite another thing since my  master has turned me off: and as I shall come to you an honest daughter,  what pleasure it is to what I should have had, if I could not have seen  you but as a guilty one. Well, my writing-time will soon be over, and so  I will make use of it now, and tell you all that has happened since my  last letter.    I wondered Mrs. Jervis did not call me to sup with her, and feared she  was angry; and when I had finished my letter, I longed for her coming  to bed. At last she came up, but seemed shy and reserved; and I said,  My dear Mrs. Jervis, I am glad to see you: you are not angry with me, I  hope. She said she was sorry things had gone so far; and that she had  a great deal of talk with my master, after I was gone; that he seemed  moved at what I said, and at my falling on my knees to him, and my  prayer for him, at my going away. He said I was a strange girl; he knew  not what to make of me. And is she gone? said he: I intended to say  something else to her; but she behaved so oddly, that I had not power  to stop her. She asked, if she should call me again? He said, Yes; and  then, No, let her go; it is best for her and me too; and she shall go,  now I have given her warning. Where she had it, I can't tell; but I  never met with the fellow of her in any life, at any age. She said,  he had ordered her not to tell me all: but she believed he would never  offer any thing to me again; and I might stay, she fancied, if I would  beg it as a favour; though she was not sure neither.    I stay! dear Mrs. Jervis; said I; why it is the best news that could  have come to me, that he will let me go. I do nothing but long to go  back again to my poverty and distress, as he threatened I should; for  though I am sure of the poverty, I shall not have half the distress I  have had for some months past, I'll assure you.    Mrs. Jervis, dear good soul! wept over me, and said, Well, well, Pamela,  I did not think I had shewn so little love to you, as that you should  express so much joy upon leaving me. I am sure I never had a child half  so dear to me as you are.    I went to hear her so good to me, as indeed she has always been, and  said, What would you have me to do, dear Mrs. Jervis? I love you next to  my own father and mother, and to leave you is the chief concern I have  at quitting this place; but I am sure it is certain ruin if I stay.  After such offers, and such threatenings, and his comparing himself to a  wicked ravisher in the very time of his last offer; and turning it into  a jest, that we should make a pretty story in a romance; can I stay and  be safe? Has he not demeaned himself twice? And it behoves me to beware  of the third time, for fear he should lay his snares surer; for perhaps  he did not expect a poor servant would resist her master so much. And  must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions, if  I stay after this? For, I think, when one of our sex finds she is  attempted, it is an encouragement to the attempter to proceed, if one  puts one's self in the way of it, when one can help it: 'Tis neither  more nor less than inviting him to think that one forgives, what, in  short, ought not to be forgiven: Which is no small countenance to foul  actions, I'll assure you.    She hugged me to her, and said I'll assure you! Pretty-face, where  gottest thou all thy knowledge, and thy good notions, at these years?  Thou art a miracle for thy age, and I shall always love thee.--But, do  you resolve to leave us, Pamela?    Yes, my dear Mrs. Jervis, said I; for, as matters stand, how can I do  otherwise?--But I'll finish the duties of my place first, if I may; and  hope you'll give me a character, as to my honesty, that it may not be  thought I was turned away for any harm. Ay, that I will, said she; I  will give thee such a character as never girl at thy years deserved. And  I am sure, said I, I will always love and honour you, as my third-best  friend, wherever I go, or whatever becomes of me.    And so we went to bed; and I never waked till 'twas time to rise;  which I did as blithe as a bird, and went about my business with great  pleasure.    But I believe my master is fearfully angry with me; for he passed by me  two or three times, and would not speak to me; and towards evening, he  met me in the passage, going into the garden, and said such a word to  me as I never heard in my life from him to man, woman, or child; for he  first said, This creature's always in the way, I think. I said, standing  up as close as I could, (and the entry was wide enough for a coach too,)  I hope I shan't be long in your honour's way. D--mn you! said he, (that  was the hard word,) for a little witch; I have no patience with you.    I profess I trembled to hear him say so; but I saw he was vexed; and,  as I am going away, I minded it the less. Well! I see, my dear parents,  that when a person will do wicked things, it is no wonder he will speak  wicked words. May God keep me out of the way of them both!                                                Your dutiful DAUGHTER.            LETTER XIX      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    Our John having an opportunity to go your way, I write again, and send  both letters at once. I can't say, yet, when I shall get away, nor how  I shall come, because Mrs. Jervis shewed my master the waistcoat I  am flowering for him, and he said, It looks well enough: I think the  creature had best stay till she has finished it.    There is some private talk carried on betwixt him and Mrs. Jervis,  that she don't tell me of; but yet"]]]
