What did you do next, Polly?\"    \"Well, we all marched into the 'Provision Room,'\" went on Polly, her  cheeks aglow, \"expecting to see our Tree just as we had left it; all but  Ben, he was going to jump into the window at the right time, when the  first thing\"--    \"Polly sat right down on the floor, saying, 'Oh!'\" cried Joel, taking  the words out of her mouth.    \"I couldn't help it, I was so surprised,\" said Polly, with shining eyes.  \"There was a most beautiful Tree, full of just everything; and there was  Mamsie, almost crying, she was so happy; and there was Cherry singing  away in his cage, and the corner of the room was all a-bloom with  flowers, and\"--    \"And Grandma Bascom was there--wasn't she funny? She used to give us  hard old raisins sometimes,\" said Joel, afraid to show what he was  feeling.    \"And Phronsie screamed right out,\" went on Polly, \"and Davie said it was  Fairyland.\"    By this time, Alexia had dropped the present she was holding, and had  run back to Polly's side again, and somehow most of the other workers  followed her example, the circle of listeners closing around the little  bunch of Peppers. \"And Jasper sent a Christmas greeting, beside the  Tree,\" Polly ended, \"and it was perfectly lovely.\"    \"And Santa Claus and Polly took hold of hands and danced around the  Tree,\" said Joel; \"I'll never forget that.\"    \"Well, you would better take hold of hands and dance down to the  recitation room,\" said Parson Henderson's deep voice, as he suddenly  appeared in their midst, \"the children are all ready to give their  carols. Come.\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE FESTIVITIES.      Phronsie looked down into the sea of eager faces \"Oh, Grandpapa,\" she  exclaimed softly, and plucking his sleeve, \"don't you think we might  hurry and begin?\"    \"Dear me, Phronsie,\" cried the old gentleman, whirling around in his big  chair to look at her, \"why, they aren't all in, child,\" glancing down  the aisle where Jasper as chief usher with Ben and the others were  busily settling the children. \"Bless me, what is Joel doing?\"    Phronsie looked too, to see Joel hurrying up to the platform with a  little colored child perched on his shoulder. She was crying all over  his new coat, and at every step uttered a sharp scream.    \"Toss the little beggar out,\" advised Livingston Bayley, as Joel shot by  with his burden.    \"Here, Joe, I'll give her a seat\" cried David from a little knot of  children, all turning excitedly around at the commotion, \"there's just  one here.\"    \"Much obliged,\" said Joel, stalking on, \"but she says she wants to see  Phronsie about something.\"    Polly, who caught the last words, looked down reproachfully at him from  the platform where Phronsie always insisted that she should sit close to  her. \"Can't help it,\" Joel telegraphed back, \"I can't stop her crying.\"    Phronsie heard now, and getting out of her chair, she stepped to the  platform edge. \"Let me take her,\" she begged.    \"Phronsie, you can't have her up here!\" Polly exclaimed, while old Mr.  King put forth an uneasy hand to stop all such proceedings, and two or  three of the others hurried up to remonstrate with Joel.    \"She wants to see me,\" said Phronsie, putting her cool cheek against the  dark little one; \"it's the new child that came yesterday,\" and she took  her off from Joel's shoulder, and staggered back to her seat by Polly's  side.    \"Phronsie, do put her down,\" whispered Polly, \"it's almost time to  begin,\" glancing off at the clock under its wealth of evergreen at the  farther end of the hall. \"Here, do let me take her.\"    But Phronsie was whispering so fast that she didn't hear.    \"What is it? Please tell me quickly, for it is almost time to have the  Tree.\"    At mention of the Tree, the little creature sat straight in Phronsie's  white lap. \"May I have some of it, if I am black?\" she begged, her beady  eyes running with tears.    \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, \"I've tied a big doll on it for you my very own  self.\" Then she put her lips on the dark little cheek. \"Now you must get  down, for I have to talk to the children, and tell them all about  things, and why they have a Christmas.\"    But the little thing huddled up against Phronsie's waist-ribbons. \"I'm  the only one that's black,\" she said. \"I want to stay here.\"    \"Now you see, Joel,\" began old Mr. King harshly. Phronsie laid a soft  hand on his arm. \"Please, Grandpapa dear, may she have a little cricket  up here? She feels lonely down with the other children, for she's only  just come.\"    \"Oh, dear--dear!\" groaned Polly, looking down at the little black object  in Phronsie's lap. \"Now what shall we do?\" This last to Jasper as he  hurried up.    \"I suppose we shall have to let her stay,\" he began.    \"When Phronsie looks like that, she won't ever let her go,\" declared  Ben, with a wise nod over at the two.    \"She's just as determined as she was that day when she would send Mr.  King her gingerbread boy,\" cried Polly, clasping her hands.    Jasper gave her a bright smile. \"I wouldn't worry, Polly,\" he said.  \"See, Joel has just put a cricket--it's all right,\" looking into Polly's  troubled eyes.    Phronsie, having seated her burden on the cricket at her feet, got out  of her own chair, and took one step toward the platform edge, beginning,  \"Dear children.\" But the small creature left behind clutched the  floating hem of the white gown, and screamed harder than ever.    \"Bless me!\" ejaculated Mr. King in great distress. \"Here, will somebody  take this child down where she belongs?\" While Polly with flushed  cheeks, leaned over, and tried to unclasp the little black fingers.    \"Go up there, Joe, and stop the row,\" said Livingston Bayley from the  visitor's seat at the end of the hall; \"you started it.\"    Jack Loughead took a step or two in the direction of the platform, then  thought better of it, and got back into his place again, hoping no one  had noticed him in the confusion.    Phronsie leaned over as well as she could for the little hands pulling  her back. \"Jasper,\" she begged, \"do move the cricket so that she may sit  by me.\"    And before anybody quite knew how it was done, there was the new child  sitting on her cricket, and huddled up against the soft folds of  Phronsie's white gown, while Phronsie, standing close to the platform  edge, began again, \"Dear children, you know this is Christmas Day--your  very own Christmas Day. And every Christmas Day since you came to the  Home, I have told you the story of the dear beautiful Lady; and every  single Christmas I am going to tell it to you again, so that you will  never, never forget her.\"    Here Phronsie turned, and pointed up to a large, full-length portrait of  Mrs. Chatterton hanging on the wall over the platform. It was painted in  her youth by a celebrated French artist, and represented a beautiful  young woman in a yellow satin gown, whose rich folds of lace fell away  from perfectly molded neck and arms.    All the children stared at the portrait as usual in this stage of the  proceedings. \"Now you must say after me, 'I thank my beautiful Lady for  this Home,'\" said Phronsie slowly.    \"I thank my beautiful Lady for this Home,\" said every child distinctly.    \"Because without her I could not have had it,\" said Phronsie. \"You must  always remember that, children. Now say it.\" She stood very patiently,  her hands folded together, and waited to hear them repeat it.    \"Because without her I could not have had it,\" said the children, one or  two coming in shrilly as a belated echo.    [Illustration: \"Will you?\" asked Phronsie, looking down into their  faces.]    \"And I thank her for the beautiful Tree,\" said Phronsie. \"Now say it,  please.\"    \"I thank her for the beautiful Tree,\" shouted the children, craning  their necks away from the portrait to get a glimpse of the  curtain-veiled Tree in the other room. \"Please can't we have it now?\"  begged several voices.    \"No; not until you all hear the story. Well, now, God took the beautiful  Lady away to Heaven; but she is always going to be here too,\" again  Phronsie pointed to the portrait, \"just as long as there is any Home.  And she is going to smile at you, because you are all going to be good  children and try to study and learn all that dear Mr. Henderson teaches  you; and you are going to obey every single thing that dear Mrs.  Henderson tells you, just as soon as she speaks,\" said Phronsie slowly,  and turning her head to look at the different rows.    \"I hope we'll be forgiven for sitting here and listening to old lady  Chatterton's praises,\" whispered Mrs. Hamilton Dyce to her husband. \"It  makes me feel dreadfully wicked to swallow it all without a protest.\"    \"Oh, we've swallowed that annually for three years now,\" said Mr. Dyce  with a little laugh, \"and grown callous. Your face is just as bad as it  was the first time Phronsie eulogized her.\"    \"I can't help it,\" declared his wife, \"when I think of that dreadful  old\"--    \"Oh, come,\" remonstrated "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#7)"],[1,"surprised the Government party, and by one on Sunday  most of the Government buildings were in their hands. It is now eight  in the morning and the firing is terrible. Volunteers are coming into  the town from all parts, so the rebels are bound to win the stronghold  shortly. News has just come that the Government troops have  surrendered. Four p.m.--I have been out to see the dead and wounded  gathered up by the ambulance wagons. I should think the dead are less  than a hundred, and the wounded about four times that number. The  surprise was so sudden that the victory has been easy and with little  loss of life. The Revolutionists are behaving well and not destroying  property as they might have done. The whole town is rejoicing; flags of  all nations are flying everywhere. The saddest thing about the affair  is that some fifty murderers have escaped from the prison. I saw many  of them running away when I got upon the spot. The order has been given  to recapture them. I trust they may be caught, for we have too many of  that class at liberty already. * * * * It is estimated that over  100,000 rounds of ammunition were fired in the two days. * * * The  insurgents fed on horse-meat and beef, the former being obtained by  killing the horses belonging to the police, the latter from the various  dairies, from which the cows were seized.\"    In 1911 the two largest Dreadnoughts of the world, the _Rivadavia_ and  the _Moreno_, were launched for the Argentine Government. These two  battleships are _half as powerful again_ as the largest British  Dreadnought.          CHAPTER III.    _THE CRIOLLO VILLAGE_.      The different centres of trade and commerce in the Argentine can easily  be reached by train or river steamer. Rosario, with its 140,000  inhabitants, in the north; Bahia Blanca, where there is the largest  wheat elevator in the world, in the south, and Mendoza, at the foot of  the Andes, several times destroyed by earthquake, five hundred miles  west--all these are more or less like the capital.    To arrive at an isolated village of the interior the traveller must be  content to ride, as I did, on horseback, or be willing to jolt along  for weeks in a wagon without springs. These carts are drawn by eight,  ten, or more bullocks, as the weight warrants, and are provided with  two very strong wheels, without tires, and often standing eight and ten  feet high. The patient animals, by means of a yoke fastened to their  horns with raw-hide, draw these carts through long prairie grass or  sinking morass, through swollen rivers or oozing mud, over which  malaria hangs in visible forms.    The _voyager_ must be prepared to suffer a little hunger and thirst on  the way. He must sleep amongst the baggage in the cart, or on the  broader bed of the ground, where snakes and tarantulas creep and the  heavy dew saturates one through and through.    As is well known, the bullock is a slow animal, and these never travel  more than two or three miles an hour.    Time with the native is no object. The words, \"With patience we win  heaven,\" are ever on his lips.    The Argentine countryman is decidedly lazy.    Darwin relates that he asked two men the question: \"Why don't you  work?\" One said: \"The days are too long!\" Another answered: \"I am too  poor.\"    With these people nothing can succeed unless it is begun when the moon  is on the increase. The result is that little is accomplished.    You cannot make the driver understand your haste, and the bullocks  understand and care still less.    The mosquitoes do their best to eat you up alive, unless your body has  already had all the blood sucked out of it, a humiliating, painful and  disfiguring process. You must carry with you sufficient food for the  journey, or it may happen that, like me, you are only able to shoot a  small ring dove, and with its entrails fish out of the muddy stream a  monster turtle for the evening meal.    If, on the other hand, you pass a solitary house, they will with  pleasure give you a sheep. If you killed one without permission your  punishment would perhaps be greater than if you had killed a man.    If a bullock becomes ill on the road, the driver will, with his knife,  cut all around the sod where the animal has left its footprint. Lifting  this out, he will cut a cross on it and replace it the other side  uppermost. This cure is most implicitly believed in and practised.    [Illustration]    The making of the cross is supposed to do great wonders, which your  guide is never tired of recounting while he drinks his _mate_ in the  unbroken stillness of the evening. Alas! the many bleaching bones on  the road testify that this, and a hundred other such remedies, are not  always effectual, but the mind of the native is so full of  superstitious faith that the testimony of his own eyes will not  convince him of the absurdity of his belief. As he stoops over the fire  you will notice on his breast some trinket or relic--anything will do  if blessed by the priest--and that, he assures you, will save him from  every unknown and unseen danger in his land voyage. The priest has said  it, and he rests satisfied that no lightning stroke will fell him, no  lurking panther pounce upon him, nor will he die of thirst or any other  evil. I have remarked men of the most cruel, cutthroat description  wearing these treasures with zealous care, especially one, of whom it  was said that he had killed two wives.    When your driver is young and amorously inclined you will notice that  he never starts for the regions beyond without first providing himself  with an owl's skin. This tied on his breast, he tells you, will ensure  him favor in the eyes of the females he may meet on the road, and on  arrival at his destination.    I once witnessed what at first sight appeared to be a heavy fall of  snow coming up with the wind from the south. Strange to relate, this  phenomenon turned out to be millions of white butterflies of large  size. Some of these, when measured, I found to be four and five inches  across the wings. Darwin relates his having, in 1832, seen the same  sight, when his men exclaimed that it was \"snowing butterflies.\"    The inhabitants of these trackless wilds are very, very few, but in all  directions I saw numbers of ostriches, which run at the least sign of  man, their enemy. The fastest horse could not outstrip this bird as  with wings outstretched he speeds before the hunter. As Job, perhaps  the oldest historian of the world, truly says: \"What time she lifteth  herself up on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.\" The male  bird joins his spouse in hatching the eggs, sitting on them perhaps  longer turns than the female, but the weather is so hot that little  brooding is required. I have had them on the shelf of my cupboard for a  week, when the little ones have forced their way out Forty days is the  time of incubation, so, naturally, those must have been already sat on  for thirty-three days. With open wings these giant birds often manage  to cover from twenty-five to forty-five eggs, although, I think, they  seldom bring out more than twenty. The rest they roll out of the nest,  where, soon rotting, they breed innumerable insects, and provide tender  food for the coming young. The latter, on arrival, are always reared by  the male ostrich, who, not being a model husband, ignominiously drives  away the partner of his joys. It might seem that he has some reason for  doing this, for the old historian before referred to says: \"She is  hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers.\"    As the longest road leads somewhere, the glare of the whitewashed  church at last meets your longing gaze on the far horizon. The village  churches are always whitewashed, and an old man is frequently employed  to strike the hours on the tower bell by guess.    I was much struck by the sameness of the many different interior towns  and villages I visited. Each wore the same aspect of indolent repose,  and each was built in exact imitation of the other. Each town possesses  its plaza, where palms and other semi-tropical plants wave their leaves  and send out their perfume.    From the principal city to the meanest village, the streets all bear  the same names. In every town you may find a _Holy Faith street_, a  _St. John street_ and a _Holy Ghost street_, and these streets are  shaded by orange, lemon, pomegranate, fig and other trees, the fruit of  which is free to all who choose to gather. All streets are in all parts  in a most disgraceful condition, and at night beneath the heavy foliage  of the trees Egyptian darkness reigns. Except in daylight, it is  difficult to walk those wretched roads, where a goat often finds  progress a difficulty. Rotten fruit, branches of trees, ashes, etc.,  all go on the streets. A hole is often bridged over by a putrefying  animal, over which run half-naked urchins, pelting each other with  oranges or lemons--common as stones. When the highways are left in such  a state, is it to be wondered at that, while standing on my own  door-step, I have been able to count eleven houses where smallpox was  doing its deadly work, all within a radius of one hundred yards?    Even in the city of La Plata, the second of importance in Argentina, I  once had the misfortune to fall into an open drain while passing down  one of the principal streets. The night was intensely dark, and yet  there was no light left there to warn either pedestrian or  vehicle-driver, and _this sewer was seven feet deep_.    Simple rusticity and ignorance are the chief characteristics of the  country people. They used to follow and stare at me as though I were a  visitor from Mars or some other planet. When I spoke to them in their  language they were delighted, and respectfully hung on my words with  bared heads. When, however, I told them of electric cars and  underground railways, they turned away in incredulity, thinking that  such marvels"]]]
