The Hon. Z. Snow then proceeded to hold his court, unmolested by gentile  law or judges. He tried and convicted several Spaniards of buying Indian  children for slaves, took the children from the Spaniards, and turned  them over to the \"brethren.\"    The Indians now began to be hostile, and the brethren were obliged to  cease pursuing the gentiles, and prepare to defend themselves against  the \"Lamanites.\" During the years 1852-53-54, more or less disturbances  prevailed.    In October, 1852, Judge Shaver arrived, as successor to Judge Brochus;  and Lazarus H. Reed, of New York, was appointed Chief Justice, to  succeed Judge Brandenburg. Judge Reed arrived in the Territory in June,  1853. Of these, Brigham said,--         \"One of our judges, Judge Shaver, has been here during the       winter, and, as far as he is known, he is a straightforward,       judicious, upright man, and a good adjudicator in the law. He       and Judge Reed, who has lately arrived, I believe will do the       best they can, and all is right.\"    Judge Snow continued to hold his office until succeeded by Judge Stiles,  in the fall of 1854.    Judge Shaver lived among the saints until his death, and was \"buried  with the faithful.\"    It is currently reported, and believed by many, that Judge Shaver died  from the effects of poison, administered by the hands of a Mormon. He  was a Southerner by birth, agreed very well with the Mormons, gave  suppers, and drank with them, and was considered a \"hail-fellow well  met.\" There was, however, some difficulty between the Judge and the  Prophet, the nature of which was not distinctly known. The difficulty  increased, and one morning the Judge was found dead in his bed. The  heads of the church took great pains to have the affair investigated,  and came to the conclusion that the Judge had died of some \"disease of  the head.\" He was followed to the grave by a large concourse of people,  and preceded by a band of music.    Less regard would be paid to these invidious reports, were it not for  the fact that Brigham Young's connection with the violent death of  divers other persons is too notorious to be denied. To say nothing of  the Mountain Meadow massacre, in which he is distinctly implicated by  evidence of an overwhelming character, there are other cases in which  his agency in causing in some way the death of the party, is scarcely  denied by himself.    For instance, the death of Almon W. Babbitt, at the hands of \"Indians,\"  on the Plains. In the summer of 1862, Brigham was referring to this  affair, in a tea-table conversation, at which Judge Waite and the writer  of this were present. On that occasion, after making some remarks to  impress upon the minds of those present the necessity of maintaining  friendly relations between the federal officers and the authorities of  the church, he used language substantially as follows:--         \"There is no need of any difficulty, and there need be none,       if the officers do their duty, and mind their own affairs. If       they do not, if they undertake to interfere in affairs that do       not concern them, I will not be far off. _There was Almon W.       Babbitt. He undertook to quarrel with me, but soon afterwards       was killed by Indians._ He lived like a fool, and died like a       fool.\"    People determined to believe only that Brigham Young is a good citizen,  and that he and his people are mostly in the right in their difficulties  with the federal officers, will doubtless be able to put an innocent  construction upon the foregoing language. But to the minds of those who  heard it, and who were most interested in its meaning, it never had but  one signification, and went far to disclose the dark and damning  character of the man.    But to return to our narrative. Judge Reed seems to have been more  fortunate in his intercourse with these people. The Mormons wished to  eradicate from his mind all unfavorable impressions created by the  sudden departure of his predecessors. They therefore treated him with  marked consideration. They hoped, through his influence, to reinstate  themselves with the authorities at Washington, and they partially  succeeded. The Judge formed quite a favorable opinion of the Mormons,  though not indorsing the administration of Brigham Young. He remained in  the valley about a year, and then went to the States, intending to  return, but died suddenly, while at his home, in Bath, Steuben County,  New York.          CHAPTER III.    POLITICAL HISTORY CONTINUED.         Col. Steptoe and Brigham Young.--Brigham reappointed Governor.       --John F. Kinney.--Western Utah, or Nevada.--Letter of Hon.       James M. Crane.--Judge Stiles and the Records.--W. W. Drummond.      In 1854 Col. Steptoe, with about 300 men, came to Salt Lake. His command  was intended for California and Oregon, but spent the winter of 1854-55  at Salt Lake City.    About this time John F. Kinney, of Iowa, was appointed Chief Justice, to  succeed Reed, and George P. Stiles, Associate Justice; Joseph Hollman,  also of Iowa, Attorney-General, and Almon W. Babbitt, Secretary. In the  spring of 1855, W. W. Drummond, of Illinois, was appointed Associate  Justice.    During the winter of 1854-55, news reached Salt Lake that President  Pierce had commissioned Col. Steptoe as Governor of Utah. This alarmed  the saints exceedingly. The Lion of the Lord was roused. Something must  be done.    Col. Steptoe had the appointment under consideration for several weeks,  and finally _refused to accept it_, and joined with Chief Justice Kinney  and others in recommending the continuance in office of Governor Young.    The question naturally arises, Why did Col. Steptoe refuse to accept the  appointment, and recommend Brigham Young? Mormons would tell you, in  confidence, that Brigham \"put a hook in his nose,\" and he was compelled  to do as he did. The Prophet of the Lord had said he would be Governor,  and no power but the Lord Almighty could hinder it.    Daring and unscrupulous as a brigand, having the means at his command,  and the ingenuity to use them, why should he not outwit the government  and deceive the people of the United States? He was determined not to  relinquish, without an effort to retain them, the power and emoluments  of his position. The following narrative of the manner in which he  accomplished his purposes, has been furnished by a Mormon who was  residing in Salt Lake City at the time, and the employment of similar  appliances on more than one occasion afterward, gives the coloring of  truth to the story.    There were in Salt Lake City, at that time, two beautiful and  fascinating women, one of whom was by marriage nearly related to the  Prophet; the other was an actress in the church theatre. Their husbands  were both \"on a mission.\" These ladies were a great deal in the society  of Col. Steptoe and his officers. Much attention was paid to the  military officers, and it would be but natural that these men should be  both pleased and flattered by the attention of sisters occupying so high  a place in the hierarchy. According to report, however, the character of  these women was not such as their exalted position in the church would  seem to require.    One evening Brigham called \"the girls\" to him, and explained that he had  a plan in which he needed their assistance. They at once consented to do  anything he might desire. The plan was soon agreed upon. He placed his  Danites at a convenient distance around the Colonel's office, and calmly  awaited developments. In a short time one of the \"police\" came to the  Prophet, and signified that it was time for him to appear on the field.  He went immediately down to the Colonel's office, which was on Main  Street, and knocked for admittance. For some time no one responded, but  the knocking continuing violently, Col. Steptoe asked who was there.  \"Brigham Young,\" said the angry Prophet; \"and I want to come in, and I  will come in.\" At this Steptoe opened the door, and Brigham entered the  front office. He seemed excited, and without being seated, asked if  Mary and Mrs. ---- were there; adding,--\"I want the girls.\" Steptoe  denied their presence; but could a prophet be deceived? \"I know better,\"  said he; \"I know they are here;\" at the same time walking into the back  office. There, on the sofa, sat two young gentlemen dressed in the  highest style, but wearing their hats. Brigham advanced, lifted the hats  of the fancy gentlemen, and the ladies he was seeking sat before him. Of  course, the righteous indignation of the Prophet knew no bounds. He  threatened Steptoe with exposure and prosecution, and told him his life  would not be safe if the friends of the ladies came to hear of the  affair. He censured the girls, and told them to go home, and finally  calmed down, and left the office.    Steptoe was greatly alarmed, and, as a compromise, offered to recommend  Brigham for the appointment which had just been tendered to himself.  With ill-concealed satisfaction on the part of Brigham and his friends,  the proposition was accepted, and \"the matter arranged.\"    Soon after, a petition was sent to the President, dated December 30,  1854, and asking for the reappointment of Young as Governor. This was  signed by Col. Steptoe and most of his officers, and by all the federal  officers then in Utah.    This array of gentile names was not to be disregarded, and Brigham Young  was reappointed Governor of Utah.    In 1854 John F. Kinney was appointed, by Franklin Pierce, Chief Justice  of Utah, and came to the valley with his family and a large stock of  goods the same year. He was known in Iowa as a \"Jack Mormon,\" and  subsequent events have proven that he was such. He sold goods and kept a  boarding-house; and at once entered into favor with the Mormon  administration. He was pecuniarily "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#7)"],[1,"not to disappoint little John Charles, for some  reason or other the next two or three years of Peace's career would seem  to have been spent in an endeavour to earn an honest living by picture  framing, a trade in which Peace, with that skill he displayed in  whatever he turned his hand to, was remarkably proficient. In Sheffield  his children attended the Sunday School. Though he never went to church  himself, he was an avowed believer in both God and the devil. As he  said, however, that he feared neither, no great reliance could be placed  on the restraining force of such a belief to a man of Peace's daring  spirit. There was only too good reason to fear that little John Charles'  period of waiting would be a prolonged one.    In 1875 Peace moved from Sheffield itself to the suburb of Darnall. Here  Peace made the acquaintance--a fatal acquaintance, as it turned out--of  a Mr. and Mrs. Dyson. Dyson was a civil engineer. He had spent some  years in America, where, in 1866, he married.    Toward the end of 1873 or the beginning of 1874, he came to England with  his wife, and obtained a post on the North Eastern Railway. He was a  tall man, over six feet in height, extremely thin, and gentlemanly in  his bearing. His engagement with the North Eastern Railway terminated  abruptly owing to Dyson's failing to appear at a station to which he had  been sent on duty.    It was believed at the time by those associated with Dyson that this  unlooked-for dereliction of duty had its cause in domestic trouble.  Since the year 1875, the year in which Peace came to Darnall, the  domestic peace of Mr. Dyson had been rudely disturbed by this same ugly  little picture-framer who lived a few doors away from the Dysons'  house. Peace had got to know the Dysons, first as a tradesman, then as  a friend. To what degree of intimacy he attained with Mrs. Dyson it is  difficult to determine. In that lies the mystery of the case Mrs. Dyson  is described as an attractive woman, \"buxom and blooming\"; she was  dark-haired, and about twenty-five years of age. In an interview with  the Vicar of Darnall a few days before his execution, Peace asserted  positively that Mrs. Dyson had been his mistress. Mrs. Dyson as  strenuously denied the fact. There was no question that on one occasion  Peace and Mrs. Dyson had been photographed together, that he had given  her a ring, and that he had been in the habit of going to music halls  and public-houses with Mrs. Dyson, who was a woman of intemperate  habits.    Peace had introduced Mrs. Dyson to his wife and daughter, and on one  occasion was said to have taken her to his mother's house, much to the  old lady's indignation. If there were not many instances of ugly men who  have been notably successful with women, one might doubt the likelihood  of Mrs. Dyson falling a victim to the charms of Charles Peace. But  Peace, for all his ugliness, could be wonderfully ingratiating when he  chose. According to Mrs. Dyson, Peace was a demon, \"beyond the power of  even a Shakespeare to paint,\" who persecuted her with his attentions,  and, when he found them rejected, devoted all his malignant energies  to making the lives of her husband and herself unbearable. According to  Peace's story he was a slighted lover who had been treated by Mrs. Dyson  with contumely and ingratitude.    Whether to put a stop to his wife's intimacy with Peace, or to protect  himself against the latter's wanton persecution, sometime about the end  of June, 1876, Dyson threw over into the garden of Peace's house a card,  on which was written: \"Charles Peace is requested not to interfere with  my family.\" On July 1 Peace met Mr. Dyson in the street, and tried to  trip him up. The same night he came up to Mrs. Dyson, who was talking  with some friends, and threatened in coarse and violent language to  blow out her brains and those of her husband. In consequence of  these incidents Mr. Dyson took out a summons against Peace, for whose  apprehension a warrant was issued. To avoid the consequences of this  last step Peace left Darnall for Hull, where he opened an eating-shop,  presided over by Mrs. Peace.    But he himself was not idle. From Hull he went to Manchester on  business, and in Manchester he committed his first murder. Entering the  grounds of a gentleman's home at Whalley Range, about midnight on  August 1, he was seen by two policemen. One of them, Constable Cock,  intercepted him as he was trying to escape.    Peace took out his revolver and warned Cock to stand back. The policeman  came on. Peace fired, but deliberately wide of him. Cock, undismayed,  drew out his truncheon, and made for the burglar. Peace, desperate,  determined not to be caught, fired again, this time fatally. Cock's  comrade heard the shots, but before he could reach the side of the dying  man, Peace had made off. He returned to Hull, and there learned shortly  after, to his intense relief, that two brothers, John and William  Habron, living near the scene of the murder, had been arrested and  charged with the killing of Constable Cock.    If the Dysons thought that they had seen the last of Peace, they were  soon to be convinced to the contrary. Peace had not forgotten his  friends at Darnall. By some means or other he was kept informed of all  their doings, and on one occasion was seen by Mrs. Dyson lurking near  her home. To get away from him the Dysons determined to leave Darnall.  They took a house at Banner Cross, another suburb of Sheffield, and  on October 29 moved into their new home. One of the first persons Mrs.  Dyson saw on arriving at Banner Cross was Peace himself. \"You see,\"  he said, \"I am here to annoy you, and I'll annoy you wherever you go.\"  Later, Peace and a friend passed Mr. Dyson in the street. Peace took out  his revolver. \"If he offers to come near me,\" said he, \"I will make him  stand back.\" But Mr. Dyson took no notice of Peace and passed on. He had  another month to live.    Whatever the other motives of Peace may have been--unreasoning passion,  spite, jealousy, or revenge it must not be forgotten that Dyson, by  procuring a warrant against Peace, had driven him from his home in  Sheffield. This Peace resented bitterly. According to the statements of  many witnesses, he was at this time in a state of constant irritation  and excitement on the Dyson's account. He struck his daughter because  she alluded in a way he did not like to his relations with Mrs. Dyson.  Peace always believed in corporal chastisement as a means of keeping  order at home. Pleasant and entertaining as he could be, he was feared.  It was very dangerous to incur his resentment. \"Be sure,\" said his wife,  \"you do nothing to offend our Charley, or you will suffer for it.\" Dyson  beyond a doubt had offended \"our Charley.\" But for the moment Peace was  interested more immediately in the fate of John and William Habron,  who were about to stand their trial for the murder of Constable Cock at  Whalley Range.    The trial commenced at the Manchester Assizes before Mr. Justice (now  Lord) Lindley on Monday, November 27. John Habron was acquitted.    The case against William Habron depended to a great extent on the fact  that he, as well as his brother, had been heard to threaten to \"do for\"  the murdered man, to shoot the \"little bobby.\" Cock was a zealous young  officer of twenty-three years of age, rather too eager perhaps in  the discharge of his duty. In July of 1876 he had taken out summonses  against John and William Habron, young fellows who had been several  years in the employment of a nurseryman in Whalley Range, for being  drunk and disorderly. On July 27 William was fined five shillings,  and on August 1, the day of Cock's murder, John had been fined half  a sovereign. Between these two dates the Habrons had been heard to  threaten to \"do for\" Cock if he were not more careful. Other facts  relied upon by the prosecution were that William Habron had inquired  from a gunsmith the price of some cartridges a day or two before the  murder; that two cartridge percussion caps had been found in the pocket  of a waistcoat given to William Habron by his employer, who swore that  they could not have been there while it was in his possession; that the  other constable on duty with Cock stated that a man he had seen lurking  near the house about twelve o'clock on the night of the murder appeared  to be William Habron's age, height and complexion, and resembled him in  general appearance; and that the boot on Habron's left foot, which was  \"wet and sludgy\" at the time of his arrest, corresponded in certain  respects with the footprints of the murderer. The prisoner did not  help himself by an ineffective attempt to prove an alibi. The Judge was  clearly not impressed by the strength of the case for the prosecution.  He pointed out to the jury that neither the evidence of identification  nor that of the footprint went very far. As to the latter, what evidence  was there to show that it had been made on the night of the murder? If  it had been made the day before, then the defence had proved that it  could not have been Habron's. He called their attention to the facts  that Habron bore a good character, that, when arrested on the night of  the murder, he was in bed, and that no firearms had been traced to him.  In spite, however, of the summing-up the jury convicted William Habron,  but recommended him to mercy. The Judge without comment sentenced him to  death. The Manchester Guardian expressed its entire concurrence with the  verdict of the jury. \"Few persons,\" it wrote, \"will be found to dispute  the justice of the conclusions reached.\" However, a few days later  it opened its columns to a number of letters protesting against the  unsatisfactory nature of the conviction. On December 6 a meeting of  some forty gentlemen was held, at which it was resolved to petition Mr.  Cross, the Home Secretary, to reconsider the sentence. Two days before  the day of"]]]
