THIOSTOLF GOES TO GLUM'S HOUSE    Thiostolf had beaten one of Hauskuld's house-carles, so he drove  him away.  He took his horse and weapons, and said to Hauskuld,  \"Now, I will go away and never come back.\"    \"All will be glad at that,\" says Hauskuld.    Thiostolf rode till he came to Varmalek, and there he got a  hearty welcome from Hallgerda, and not a bad one from Glum.  He  told Hallgerda how her father had driven him away, and begged her  to give him her help and countenance.  She answered him by  telling him she could say nothing about his staying there before  she had seen Glum about it.    \"Does it go well between you?\" he says.    \"Yes,\" she says, \"our love runs smooth enough.\"    After that she went to speak to Glum, and threw her arms round  his neck and said, \"Wilt thou grant me a boon which I wish to ask  of thee?\"    \"Grant it I will,\" he says, \"if it be right and seemly; but what  is it thou wishest to ask?\"    \"Well,\" she said, \"Thiostolf has been driven away from the west,  and what I want thee to do is to let him stay here; but I will  not take it crossly if it is not to thy mind.\"    Glum said, \"Now that thou behavest so well, I will grant thee thy  boon; but I tell thee, if he takes to any ill he shall be sent  off at once.\"    She goes then to Thiostolf and tells him, and he answered, \"Now,  thou art still good, as I had hoped.\"    After that he was there, and kept himself down a little while,  but then it was the old story, he seemed to spoil all the good he  found; for he gave way to no one save to Hallgerda alone, but she  never took his side in his brawls with others.  Thorarin, Glum's  brother, blamed him for letting him be there, and said ill luck  would come of it, and all would happen as had happened before if  he were there.  Glum answered him well and kindly, but still kept  on in his own way.        16. GLUM'S SHEEP HUNT    Now once on a time when autumn came, it happened that men had  hard work to get their flocks home, and many of Glum's wethers  were missing.  Then Glum said to Thiostolf, \"Go thou up on the  fell with my house-carles and see if ye cannot find out anything  about the sheep.\"    \"'Tis no business of mine,\" says Thiostolf, \"to hunt up sheep,  and this one thing is quite enough to hinder it.  I won't walk in  thy thralls' footsteps.  But go thyself, and then I'll go with  thee.\"    About this they had many words.  The weather was good, and  Hallgerda was sitting out of doors.  Glum went up to her and  said, \"Now Thiostolf and I have had a quarrel, and we shall not  live much longer together.\"  And so he told her all that they had  been talking about.    Then Hallgerda spoke up for Thiostolf, and they had many words  about him.  At last Glum gave her a blow with his hand, and said,  \"I will strive no longer with thee,\" and with that he went away.    Now she loved him much, and could not calm herself, but wept out  loud.  Thiostolf went up to her and said, \"This is sorry sport  for thee, and so it must not be often again.\"    \"Nay,\" she said, \"but thou shalt not avenge this, nor meddle at  all whatever passes between Glum and me.\"    He went off with a spiteful grin.        17. GLUM'S SLAYING    Now Glum called men to follow him, and Thiostolf got ready and  went with them.  So they went up South Reykiardale and then up  along by Baugagil and so south to Crossfell.  But some of his  band he sent to the Sulafells, and they all found very many  sheep.  Some of them, too, went by way of Scoradale, and it came  about at last that those twain, Glum and Thiostolf, were left  alone together.  They went south from Crossfell and found there a  flock of wild sheep, and they went from the south towards the  fell, and tried to drive them down; but still the sheep got away  from them up on the fell.  Then each began to scold the other,  and Thiostolf said at last that Glum had no strength save to  tumble about in Hallgerda's arms.    Then Glum said, \"`A man's foes are those of his own house.'  Shall I take upbraiding from thee, runaway thrall as thou art?\"    Thiostolf said, \"Thou shalt soon have to own that I am no thrall,  for I will not yield an inch to thee.\"    Then Glum got angry, and cut at him with his hand-axe, but he  threw his axe in the way, and the blow fell on the haft with a  downward stroke and bit into it about the breadth of two fingers.  Thiostolf cut at him at once with his axe, and smote him on the  shoulder, and the stroke hewed asunder the shoulderbone and  collarbone, and the wound bled inwards.  Glum grasped at  Thiostolf with his left hand so fast, that he fell; but Glum  could not hold him, for death came over him.  Then Thiostolf  covered his body with stones, and took off his gold ring.  Then  he went straight to Varmalek.  Hallgerda was sitting out of  doors, and saw that his axe was bloody.  He said, \"I know not  what thou wilt think of it, but I tell thee Glum is slain.\"    \"That must be thy deed,\" she says.    \"So it is,\" he says.    She laughed and said, \"Thou dost not stand for nothing in this  sport.\"    \"What thinkest thou is best to be done now?\" he asked.    \"Go to Hrut, my father's brother,\" she said, \"and let him see  about thee.\"    \"I do not know,\" says Thiostolf, \"whether this is good advice;  but still I will take thy counsel in this matter.\"    So he took his horse, and rode west to Hrutstede that night.  He  binds his horse at the back of the house, and then goes round to  the door, and gives a great knock.  After that he walks round the  house, north about.  It happened that Hrut was awake.  He sprang  up at once, and put on his jerkin and pulled on his shoes.  Then  he took up his sword, and wrapped a cloak about his left arm, up  as far as the elbow.  Men woke up just as he went out; there he  saw a tall stout man at the back of the house, and knew it was  Thiostolf.  Hrut asked him what news?    \"I tell thee Glum is slain.\" says Thiostolf.    \"Who did the deed?\" says Hrut.    \"I slew him,\" says Thiostolf.    \"Why rodest thou hither?\" says Hrut.    \"Hallgerda sent me to thee,\" says Thiostolf.    \"Then she has no hand in this deed,\" says Hrut, and drew his  sword.  Thiostolf saw that, and would not be behind hand, so he  cuts at Hrut at once.  Hrut got out of the way of the stroke by a  quick turn, and at the same time struck the back of the axe so  smartly with a side-long blow of his left hand, that it flew out  of Thiostolf's grasp.  Then Hrut made a blow with his sword in  his right hand at Thiostolf's leg, just above the knee, and cut  it almost off so that it hung by a little piece, and sprang in  upon him at the same time, and thrust him hard back.  After that  he smote him on the head, and dealt him his death-blow.  Thiostolf fell down on his back at full length, and then out came  Hrut's men, and saw the tokens of the deed.  Hrut made them take  Thiostolf away, and throw stones over his body, and then he went  to find Hauskuld, and told him of Glum's slaying, and also of  Thiostolf's.  He thought it harm that Glum was dead and gone, but  thanked him for killing Thiostolf.  A little while after,  Thorarin Ragi's brother hears of his brother Glum's death, then  he rides with eleven men behind him west to Hauskuldstede, and  Hauskuld welcomed him with both hands, and he is there the night.  Hauskuld sent at once for Hrut to come to him, and he went at  once, and next day they spoke much of the slaying of Glum, and  Thorarin said \"Wilt thou make me any atonement for my brother,  for I have had a great loss?\"    Hauskuld answered, \"I did not slay thy brother, nor did my  daughter plot his death; but as soon as ever Hrut knew it he slew  Thiostolf.\"    Then Thorarin held his peace, and thought the matter had taken a  bad turn.  But Hrut said, \"Let us make his journey good; he has  indeed had a heavy loss, and if we do that we shall be well  spoken of.  So let us give him gifts, and then he will be our  friend ever afterwards.\"    So the end of it was, that those brothers gave him gifts, and he  rode back south.  He and Hallgerda changed homesteads in the  spring, and she went south to Laugarness and he to Varmalek.  And  now Thorarin is out of the story.        18. FIDDLE MORD'S DEATH    Now it must be told how Fiddle Mord took a sickness and breathed  his last; and that was thought great scathe.  His daughter Unna  took all the goods he left behind him.  She was then still  unmarried the second time.  She was very layish, and unthrifty of  her property; so that her goods and ready money wasted away, and  at last she had scarce anything left but land and stock.        19. GUNNAR COMES INTO THE STORY    There was a man whose name was Gunnar.  He was one of Unna's  kinsmen, and his mother's name was Rannveig (1).  Gunnar's father  was named Hamond (2).  Gunnar Hamond's son dwelt at Lithend, in  the Fleetlithe.  He was a tall man in growth, and a strong man --  best skilled in arms of all men.  He could cut or thrust or shoot  if he chose as well with his left as with his right hand, and he  smote so swiftly with his sword, that three seemed to flash  through the air at once.  He was the best shot with the bow of  all men, and never missed his mark.  He could leap more than his  own height, with all his war-gear, and as far backwards as  forwards.  He could swim like a seal, and there was no game in  which it was any good for any one to strive with him; and so it  has been said that no man was his match.  He was handsome of  feature, and fair skinned.  His nose was straight, and a little  turned up at the end.  He was blue-eyed and bright-eyed, and  ruddy-cheeked.  His hair thick, and of good hue, and hanging down  in comely curls.  The most courteous of men was he, of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#7)"],[1,"tale many scores of times to his apothecary, Dr. Gollop,  when he came to inquire about the liver and the blue-pill.    Being an invalid, Joseph Sedley contented himself with a bottle of  claret besides his Madeira at dinner, and he managed a couple of plates  full of strawberries and cream, and twenty-four little rout cakes that  were lying neglected in a plate near him, and certainly (for novelists  have the privilege of knowing everything) he thought a great deal about  the girl upstairs.  \"A nice, gay, merry young creature,\" thought he to  himself.  \"How she looked at me when I picked up her handkerchief at  dinner!  She dropped it twice.  Who's that singing in the drawing-room?  'Gad! shall I go up and see?\"    But his modesty came rushing upon him with uncontrollable force. His  father was asleep: his hat was in the hall: there was a hackney-coach  standing hard by in Southampton Row.  \"I'll go and see the Forty  Thieves,\" said he, \"and Miss Decamp's dance\"; and he slipped away  gently on the pointed toes of his boots, and disappeared, without  waking his worthy parent.    \"There goes Joseph,\" said Amelia, who was looking from the open windows  of the drawing-room, while Rebecca was singing at the piano.    \"Miss Sharp has frightened him away,\" said Mrs. Sedley.  \"Poor Joe, why  WILL he be so shy?\"        CHAPTER IV    The Green Silk Purse    Poor Joe's panic lasted for two or three days; during which he did not  visit the house, nor during that period did Miss Rebecca ever mention  his name.  She was all respectful gratitude to Mrs. Sedley; delighted  beyond measure at the Bazaars; and in a whirl of wonder at the theatre,  whither the good-natured lady took her.  One day, Amelia had a  headache, and could not go upon some party of pleasure to which the two  young people were invited: nothing could induce her friend to go  without her. \"What! you who have shown the poor orphan what happiness  and love are for the first time in her life--quit YOU?  Never!\"  and  the green eyes looked up to Heaven and filled with tears; and Mrs.  Sedley could not but own that her daughter's friend had a charming kind  heart of her own.    As for Mr. Sedley's jokes, Rebecca laughed at them with a cordiality  and perseverance which not a little pleased and softened that  good-natured gentleman.  Nor was it with the chiefs of the family alone  that Miss Sharp found favour.  She interested Mrs. Blenkinsop by  evincing the deepest sympathy in the raspberry-jam preserving, which  operation was then going on in the Housekeeper's room; she persisted in  calling Sambo \"Sir,\" and \"Mr. Sambo,\" to the delight of that attendant;  and she apologised to the lady's maid for giving her trouble in  venturing to ring the bell, with such sweetness and humility, that the  Servants' Hall was almost as charmed with her as the Drawing Room.    Once, in looking over some drawings which Amelia had sent from school,  Rebecca suddenly came upon one which caused her to burst into tears and  leave the room. It was on the day when Joe Sedley made his second  appearance.    Amelia hastened after her friend to know the cause of this display of  feeling, and the good-natured girl came back without her companion,  rather affected too.  \"You know, her father was our drawing-master,  Mamma, at Chiswick, and used to do all the best parts of our drawings.\"    \"My love! I'm sure I always heard Miss Pinkerton say that he did not  touch them--he only mounted them.\" \"It was called mounting, Mamma.  Rebecca remembers the drawing, and her father working at it, and the  thought of it came upon her rather suddenly--and so, you know, she--\"    \"The poor child is all heart,\" said Mrs. Sedley.    \"I wish she could stay with us another week,\" said Amelia.    \"She's devilish like Miss Cutler that I used to meet at Dumdum, only  fairer.  She's married now to Lance, the Artillery Surgeon.  Do you  know, Ma'am, that once Quintin, of the 14th, bet me--\"    \"O Joseph, we know that story,\" said Amelia, laughing. \"Never mind about  telling that; but persuade Mamma to write to Sir Something Crawley for  leave of absence for poor dear Rebecca: here she comes, her eyes red  with weeping.\"    \"I'm better, now,\" said the girl, with the sweetest smile possible,  taking good-natured Mrs. Sedley's extended hand and kissing it  respectfully.  \"How kind you all are to me! All,\" she added, with a  laugh, \"except you, Mr. Joseph.\"    \"Me!\" said Joseph, meditating an instant departure. \"Gracious Heavens!  Good Gad! Miss Sharp!'    \"Yes; how could you be so cruel as to make me eat that horrid  pepper-dish at dinner, the first day I ever saw you? You are not so  good to me as dear Amelia.\"    \"He doesn't know you so well,\" cried Amelia.    \"I defy anybody not to be good to you, my dear,\" said her mother.    \"The curry was capital; indeed it was,\" said Joe, quite gravely.  \"Perhaps there was NOT enough citron juice in it--no, there was NOT.\"    \"And the chilis?\"    \"By Jove, how they made you cry out!\" said Joe, caught by the ridicule  of the circumstance, and exploding in a fit of laughter which ended  quite suddenly, as usual.    \"I shall take care how I let YOU choose for me another time,\" said  Rebecca, as they went down again to dinner.  \"I didn't think men were  fond of putting poor harmless girls to pain.\"    \"By Gad, Miss Rebecca, I wouldn't hurt you for the world.\"    \"No,\" said she, \"I KNOW you wouldn't\"; and then she gave him ever so  gentle a pressure with her little hand, and drew it back quite  frightened, and looked first for one instant in his face, and then down  at the carpet-rods; and I am not prepared to say that Joe's heart did  not thump at this little involuntary, timid, gentle motion of regard on  the part of the simple girl.    It was an advance, and as such, perhaps, some ladies of indisputable  correctness and gentility will condemn the action as immodest; but, you  see, poor dear Rebecca had all this work to do for herself.  If a  person is too poor to keep a servant, though ever so elegant, he must  sweep his own rooms: if a dear girl has no dear Mamma to settle matters  with the young man, she must do it for herself.  And oh, what a mercy  it is that these women do not exercise their powers oftener! We can't  resist them, if they do.  Let them show ever so little inclination, and  men go down on their knees at once: old or ugly, it is all the same.  And this I set down as a positive truth. A woman with fair  opportunities, and without an absolute hump, may marry WHOM SHE LIKES.  Only let us be thankful that the darlings are like the beasts of the  field, and don't know their own power.  They would overcome us entirely  if they did.    \"Egad!\" thought Joseph, entering the dining-room, \"I exactly begin to  feel as I did at Dumdum with Miss Cutler.\" Many sweet little appeals,  half tender, half jocular, did Miss Sharp make to him about the dishes  at dinner; for by this time she was on a footing of considerable  familiarity with the family, and as for the girls, they loved each  other like sisters.  Young unmarried girls always do, if they are in a  house together for ten days.    As if bent upon advancing Rebecca's plans in every way--what must  Amelia do, but remind her brother of a promise made last Easter  holidays--\"When I was a girl at school,\" said she, laughing--a promise  that he, Joseph, would take her to Vauxhall.  \"Now,\" she said, \"that  Rebecca is with us, will be the very time.\"    \"O, delightful!\" said Rebecca, going to clap her hands; but she  recollected herself, and paused, like a modest creature, as she was.    \"To-night is not the night,\" said Joe.    \"Well, to-morrow.\"    \"To-morrow your Papa and I dine out,\" said Mrs. Sedley.    \"You don't suppose that I'm going, Mrs. Sed?\" said her husband, \"and  that a woman of your years and size is to catch cold, in such an  abominable damp place?\"    \"The children must have someone with them,\" cried Mrs. Sedley.    \"Let Joe go,\" said-his father, laughing.  \"He's big enough.\" At which  speech even Mr. Sambo at the sideboard burst out laughing, and poor fat  Joe felt inclined to become a parricide almost.    \"Undo his stays!\" continued the pitiless old gentleman. \"Fling some  water in his face, Miss Sharp, or carry him upstairs: the dear  creature's fainting.  Poor victim! carry him up; he's as light as a  feather!\"    \"If I stand this, sir, I'm d------!\" roared Joseph.    \"Order Mr. Jos's elephant, Sambo!\" cried the father. \"Send to Exeter  'Change, Sambo\"; but seeing Jos ready almost to cry with vexation, the  old joker stopped his laughter, and said, holding out his hand to his  son, \"It's all fair on the Stock Exchange, Jos--and, Sambo, never mind  the elephant, but give me and Mr. Jos a glass of Champagne.  Boney  himself hasn't got such in his cellar, my boy!\"    A goblet of Champagne restored Joseph's equanimity, and before the  bottle was emptied, of which as an invalid he took two-thirds, he had  agreed to take the young ladies to Vauxhall.    \"The girls must have a gentleman apiece,\" said the old gentleman. \"Jos  will be sure to leave Emmy in the crowd, he will be so taken up with  Miss Sharp here.  Send to 96, and ask George Osborne if he'll come.\"    At this, I don't know in the least for what reason, Mrs. Sedley looked  at her husband and laughed.  Mr. Sedley's eyes twinkled in a manner  indescribably roguish, and he looked at Amelia; and Amelia, hanging  down her head, blushed as only young ladies of seventeen know how to  blush, and as Miss Rebecca Sharp never blushed in her life--at least  not since she was eight years old, and when she was caught stealing jam  out of a cupboard by her godmother.  \"Amelia had better write a note,\"  said her father; \"and let George Osborne see what a beautiful  handwriting we have brought back from Miss Pinkerton's.  Do you  remember when you wrote to him to come on Twelfth-night, Emmy, and  spelt twelfth without the f?\"    \"That was years ago,\" said Amelia.  "]]]
