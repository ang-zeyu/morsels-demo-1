A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to  Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.    Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and  Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be  able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.    THE END          THE TALE OF MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE    for THE REAL LITTLE LUCIE OF NEWLANDS      ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a  farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl--only she was always  losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!    One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!  \"I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen  them, Tabby Kitten?\"    THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled  hen--    \"Sally Henny-penny, has YOU found three pocket-handkins?\"    But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--    \"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\"    AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.    Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he  flew over a stile and away.    Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind  Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had  no top!    And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things  spread upon the grass.    LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her;  she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right  away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.    Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the  water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an  egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks  of a VERY small person.    Lucie ran on, and on.    THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and  there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited  rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!    But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside  it some one was singing--        \"Lily-white and clean, oh!      With little frills between, oh!      Smooth and hot--red rusty spot      Never here be seen, oh!\"    LUCIE, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. A little  frightened voice called out \"Who's that?\"    Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the  hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just  like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's  head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was  everything there.    THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her  hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.    Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her  striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle,  and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie  had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!    \"WHO are you?\" said Lucie. \"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?\"    The little person made a bob-curtsey--\"Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name  is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent  clear-starcher!\" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and  spread it on the ironing-blanket.    \"WHAT'S that thing?\" said Lucie--\"that's not my pocket-handkin?\"    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to  Cock Robin!\"    And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse--\"That isn't my pinny?\"  said Lucie.    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny  Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!\"  said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes  went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    \"THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!\" cried Lucie--\"and there's my  pinny!\"    Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.    \"Oh that IS lovely!\" said Lucie.    \"AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?\"    \"Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how  she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon  go barefoot!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    \"WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?\"    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID  so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the  smell.\"    \"There's another one of mine,\" said Lucie.    \"WHAT are those funny little white things?\"    \"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron  them; she washes them herself.\"    \"There's my last pocket-handkin!\" said Lucie.    \"AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?\"    \"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most  terrible particular!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \"Now I've finished my  ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.\"    \"WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?\" said Lucie.    \"Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.\"    \"Will their jackets take off?\" asked Lucy.    \"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And  here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.  They're ALWAYS marked at washing!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of  mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat  with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue  jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had  gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.  They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and  very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her  cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't  like to sit too near her.    WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and  Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and  fastened with a silver safety-pin.    And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the  door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the  bundles of clothes!    All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet  them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!    AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals  and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was  nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.    LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she  turned to say \"Good-night,\" and to thank the washer-woman--But what a  VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or  for the washing bill!    She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white  frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    AND how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with PRICKLES!    Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.        * * * *    (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the  stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and  a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?    And besides--_I_ have seen that door into the back of the hill called  Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs.  Tiggy-winkle!)      THE TALE OF GINGER & PICKLES    ONCE upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was  \"Ginger and Pickles.\"    It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls--Lucinda and  Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.    The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and  Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.    They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.    In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything  --except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces,  hair-pins and mutton chops.    Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a  yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.    The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.    The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid  of Ginger.    Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made  his mouth water.    \"I cannot bear,\" said he, \"to see them going out at the door carrying  their little parcels.\"    \"I have the same feeling about rats,\" replied Pickles, \"but it would  never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha  Twitchit's.\"    \"On the contrary, they would go nowhere,\" replied Ginger gloomily.    (Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not  give credit.)    Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.    Now the meaning of \"credit\" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap,  instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it--she says  she will pay another time.    And Pickles makes a low bow and says, \"With pleasure, madam,\" and it is  written down in a book.    The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of  being afraid of Ginger and Pickles. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#7)"],[1,"implied,  for reasons which remain obscure, that what can have no importance for  us cannot be real, and that therefore matter, if it is not composed of  minds or of mental ideas, is impossible and a mere chimaera.    To go into this argument fully at our present stage would be impossible,  since it raises points requiring a considerable preliminary discussion;  but certain reasons for rejecting the argument may be noticed at  once. To begin at the end: there is no reason why what cannot have any  _practical_ importance for us should not be real. It is true that,  if _theoretical_ importance is included, everything real is of _some_  importance to us, since, as persons desirous of knowing the truth about  the universe, we have some interest in everything that the universe  contains. But if this sort of interest is included, it is not the case  that matter has no importance for us, provided it exists even if we  cannot know that it exists. We can, obviously, suspect that it may  exist, and wonder whether it does; hence it is connected with our desire  for knowledge, and has the importance of either satisfying or thwarting  this desire.    Again, it is by no means a truism, and is in fact false, that we cannot  know that anything exists which we do not know. The word 'know' is here  used in two different senses. (1) In its first use it is applicable to  the sort of knowledge which is opposed to error, the sense in which  what we know is _true_, the sense which applies to our beliefs and  convictions, i.e. to what are called _judgements_. In this sense of the  word we know _that_ something is the case. This sort of knowledge may  be described as knowledge of _truths_. (2) In the second use of the word  'know' above, the word applies to our knowledge of _things_, which we  may call _acquaintance_. This is the sense in which we know sense-data.  (The distinction involved is roughly that between _savoir_ and  _connaitre_ in French, or between _wissen_ and _kennen_ in German.)    Thus the statement which seemed like a truism becomes, when re-stated,  the following: 'We can never truly judge that something with which we  are not acquainted exists.' This is by no means a truism, but on the  contrary a palpable falsehood. I have not the honour to be acquainted  with the Emperor of China, but I truly judge that he exists. It may  be said, of course, that I judge this because of other people's  acquaintance with him. This, however, would be an irrelevant retort,  since, if the principle were true, I could not know that any one else  is acquainted with him. But further: there is no reason why I should not  know of the existence of something with which nobody is acquainted. This  point is important, and demands elucidation.    If I am acquainted with a thing which exists, my acquaintance gives  me the knowledge that it exists. But it is not true that, conversely,  whenever I can know that a thing of a certain sort exists, I or some one  else must be acquainted with the thing. What happens, in cases where I  have true judgement without acquaintance, is that the thing is known to  me by _description_, and that, in virtue of some general principle, the  existence of a thing answering to this description can be inferred  from the existence of something with which I am acquainted. In order  to understand this point fully, it will be well first to deal with  the difference between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by  description, and then to consider what knowledge of general principles,  if any, has the same kind of certainty as our knowledge of the existence  of our own experiences. These subjects will be dealt with in the  following chapters.        CHAPTER V. KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION    In the preceding chapter we saw that there are two sorts of knowledge:  knowledge of things, and knowledge of truths. In this chapter we shall  be concerned exclusively with knowledge of things, of which in turn we  shall have to distinguish two kinds. Knowledge of things, when it is  of the kind we call knowledge by _acquaintance_, is essentially simpler  than any knowledge of truths, and logically independent of knowledge  of truths, though it would be rash to assume that human beings ever,  in fact, have acquaintance with things without at the same time knowing  some truth about them. Knowledge of things by _description_, on the  contrary, always involves, as we shall find in the course of the present  chapter, some knowledge of truths as its source and ground. But first of  all we must make clear what we mean by 'acquaintance' and what we mean  by 'description'.    We shall say that we have _acquaintance_ with anything of which we are  directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference  or any knowledge of truths. Thus in the presence of my table I am  acquainted with the sense-data that make up the appearance of my  table--its colour, shape, hardness, smoothness, etc.; all these are  things of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching  my table. The particular shade of colour that I am seeing may have many  things said about it--I may say that it is brown, that it is rather  dark, and so on. But such statements, though they make me know truths  about the colour, do not make me know the colour itself any better  than I did before so far as concerns knowledge of the colour itself, as  opposed to knowledge of truths about it, I know the colour perfectly and  completely when I see it, and no further knowledge of it itself is even  theoretically possible. Thus the sense-data which make up the  appearance of my table are things with which I have acquaintance, things  immediately known to me just as they are.    My knowledge of the table as a physical object, on the contrary, is not  direct knowledge. Such as it is, it is obtained through acquaintance  with the sense-data that make up the appearance of the table. We have  seen that it is possible, without absurdity, to doubt whether there is  a table at all, whereas it is not possible to doubt the sense-data. My  knowledge of the table is of the kind which we shall call 'knowledge  by description'. The table is 'the physical object which causes  such-and-such sense-data'. This describes the table by means of the  sense-data. In order to know anything at all about the table, we must  know truths connecting it with things with which we have acquaintance:  we must know that 'such-and-such sense-data are caused by a physical  object'. There is no state of mind in which we are directly aware of the  table; all our knowledge of the table is really knowledge of truths, and  the actual thing which is the table is not, strictly speaking, known  to us at all. We know a description, and we know that there is just one  object to which this description applies, though the object itself is  not directly known to us. In such a case, we say that our knowledge of  the object is knowledge by description.    All our knowledge, both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths,  rests upon acquaintance as its foundation. It is therefore important to  consider what kinds of things there are with which we have acquaintance.    Sense-data, as we have already seen, are among the things with which  we are acquainted; in fact, they supply the most obvious and striking  example of knowledge by acquaintance. But if they were the sole example,  our knowledge would be very much more restricted than it is. We should  only know what is now present to our senses: we could not know anything  about the past--not even that there was a past--nor could we know any  truths about our sense-data, for all knowledge of truths, as we shall  show, demands acquaintance with things which are of an essentially  different character from sense-data, the things which are sometimes  called 'abstract ideas', but which we shall call 'universals'. We have  therefore to consider acquaintance with other things besides sense-data  if we are to obtain any tolerably adequate analysis of our knowledge.    The first extension beyond sense-data to be considered is acquaintance  by _memory_. It is obvious that we often remember what we have seen or  heard or had otherwise present to our senses, and that in such cases we  are still immediately aware of what we remember, in spite of the fact  that it appears as past and not as present. This immediate knowledge by  memory is the source of all our knowledge concerning the past: without  it, there could be no knowledge of the past by inference, since we  should never know that there was anything past to be inferred.    The next extension to be considered is acquaintance by _introspection_.  We are not only aware of things, but we are often aware of being aware  of them. When I see the sun, I am often aware of my seeing the sun; thus  'my seeing the sun' is an object with which I have acquaintance. When  I desire food, I may be aware of my desire for food; thus 'my desiring  food' is an object with which I am acquainted. Similarly we may be  aware of our feeling pleasure or pain, and generally of the events which  happen in our minds. This kind of acquaintance, which may be called  self-consciousness, is the source of all our knowledge of mental things.  It is obvious that it is only what goes on in our own minds that can be  thus known immediately. What goes on in the minds of others is known  to us through our perception of their bodies, that is, through the  sense-data in us which are associated with their bodies. But for our  acquaintance with the contents of our own minds, we should be unable to  imagine the minds of others, and therefore we could never arrive at  the knowledge that they have minds. It seems natural to suppose that  self-consciousness is one of the things that distinguish men from  animals: animals, we may suppose, though they have acquaintance with  sense-data, never become aware of this acquaintance.
