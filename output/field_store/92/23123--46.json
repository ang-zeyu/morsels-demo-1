[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis â€” Complete (#7)"],[1," building, on Market Street, and in the middle  of the block, what had once been a golden hand pointed up a narrow dusty  stairway.    Here was a sign, \"Law office of Silas Whipple.\"    Stephen climbed the stairs, and arrived at a ground glass door, on which  the sign was repeated. Behind that door was the future: so he opened it  fearfully, with an impulse to throw his arm above his head. But he was  struck dumb on beholding, instead of a dragon, a good-natured young  man who smiled a broad welcome. The reaction was as great as though one  entered a dragon's den, armed to the teeth, to find a St. Bernard doing  the honors.    Stephen's heart went out to this young man,--after that organ had jumped  back into its place. This keeper of the dragon looked the part. Even the  long black coat which custom then decreed could not hide the bone and  sinew under it. The young man had a broad forehead, placid Dresden-blue  eyes, flaxen hair, and the German coloring. Across one of his high  cheek-bones was a great jagged scar which seemed to add distinction  to his appearance. That caught Stephen's eye, and held it. He wondered  whether it were the result of an encounter with the Judge.    \"You wish to see Mr. Whipple?\" he asked, in the accents of an educated  German.    \"Yes,\" said Stephen, \"if he isn't busy.\"    \"He is out,\" said the other, with just a suspicion of a 'd' in the word.  \"You know he is much occupied now, fighting election frauds. You read  the papers?\"    \"I am a stranger here,\" said Stephen.    \"Ach!\" exclaimed the German, \"now I know you, Mr. Brice. The young  one from Boston the Judge spoke of. But you did not tell him of your  arrival.\"    \"I did not wish to bother him,\" Stephen replied, smiling.    \"My name is Richter--Carl Richter, sir.\"    The pressure of Mr. Richter's big hands warmed Stephen as nothing else  had since he had come West. He was moved to return it with a little more  fervor than he usually showed. And he felt, whatever the Judge might be,  that he had a powerful friend near at hand--Mr. Richter's welcome came  near being an embrace.    \"Sit down, Mr. Brice,\" he said; \"mild weather for November, eh? The  Judge will be here in an hour.\"    Stephen looked around him: at the dusty books on the shelves, and the  still dustier books heaped on Mr. Richter's big table; at the cuspidors;  at the engravings of Washington and Webster; at the window in the jog  which looked out on the court-house square; and finally at another  ground-glass door on which was printed:                   SILAS WHIPPLE                    PRIVATE    This, then, was the den,--the arena in which was to take place a  memorable interview. But the thought of waiting an hour for the dragon  to appear was disquieting. Stephen remembered that he had something over  nine hundred dollars in his pocket (which he had saved out of his last  year's allowance at the Law School). So he asked Mr. Richter, who was  dusting off a chair, to direct him to the nearest bank.    \"Why, certainly,\" said he; \"Mr. Brinsmade's bank on Chestnut Street.\" He  took Stephen to the window and pointed across the square. \"I am sorry I  cannot go with you,\" he added, \"but the Judge's negro, Shadrach, is out,  and I must stay in the office. I will give you a note to Mr. Brinsmade.\"    \"His negro!\" exclaimed Stephen. \"Why, I thought that Mr. Whipple was an  Abolitionist.\"    Mr. Richter laughed.    \"The man is free,\" said he. \"The Judge pays him wages.\"    Stephen thanked his new friend for the note to the bank president, and  went slowly down the stairs. To be keyed up to a battle-pitch, and then  to have the battle deferred, is a trial of flesh and spirit.    As he reached the pavement, he saw people gathering in front of the wide  entrance of the Court House opposite, and perched on the copings.  He hesitated, curious. Then he walked slowly toward the place, and  buttoning his coat, pushed through the loafers and passers-by dallying  on the outskirts of the crowd. There, in the bright November sunlight, a  sight met his eyes which turned him sick and dizzy.    Against the walls and pillars of the building, already grimy with  soot, crouched a score of miserable human beings waiting to be sold at  auction. Mr. Lynch's slave pen had been disgorged that morning. Old and  young, husband and wife,--the moment was come for all and each. How  hard the stones and what more pitiless than the gaze of their  fellow-creatures in the crowd below! O friends, we who live in peace and  plenty amongst our families, how little do we realize the terror and  the misery and the dumb heart-aches of those days! Stephen thought with  agony of seeing his own mother sold before his eyes, and the building in  front of him was lifted from its foundation and rocked even as shall the  temples on the judgment day.    The oily auctioneer was inviting the people to pinch the wares. Men came  forward to feel the creatures and look into their mouths, and one brute,  unshaven and with filthy linen, snatched a child from its mother's  lap Stephen shuddered with the sharpest pain he had ever known. An  ocean-wide tempest arose in his breast, Samson's strength to break  the pillars of the temple to slay these men with his bare hands. Seven  generations of stern life and thought had their focus here in him,--from  Oliver Cromwell to John Brown.    Stephen was far from prepared for the storm that raged within him.  He had not been brought up an Abolitionist--far from it. Nor had his  father's friends--who were deemed at that time the best people in  Boston--been Abolitionists. Only three years before, when Boston had  been aflame over the delivery of the fugitive Anthony Burns, Stephen  had gone out of curiosity to the meeting at Faneuil Hall. How well he  remembered his father's indignation when he confessed it, and in his  anger Mr. Brice had called Phillips and Parker \"agitators.\" But his  father, nor his father's friends in Boston had never been brought face  to face with this hideous traffic.    Hark! Was that the sing-song voice of the auctioneer He was selling the  cattle. High and low, caressing an menacing, he teased and exhorted them  to buy. The were bidding, yes, for the possession of souls, bidding in  the currency of the Great Republic. And between the eager shouts came a  moan of sheer despair. What was the attendant doing now? He was tearing  two of then: from a last embrace.    Three--four were sold while Stephen was in a dream    Then came a lull, a hitch, and the crowd began to chatter gayly. But the  misery in front of him held Stephen in a spell. Figures stood out from  the group. A white-haired patriarch, with eyes raised to the sky;  a flat-breasted woman whose child was gone, whose weakness made her  valueless. Then two girls were pushed forth, one a quadroon of great  beauty, to be fingered. Stephen turned his face away,--to behold Mr.  Eliphalet Hopper looking calmly on.    \"Wal, Mr. Brice, this is an interesting show now, ain't it? Something we  don't have. I generally stop here to take a look when I'm passing.\" And  he spat tobacco juice on the coping.    Stephen came to his senses.    \"And you are from New England?\" he said.    Mr. Hopper laughed.    \"Tarnation!\" said he, \"you get used to it. When I came here, I was a  sort of an Abolitionist. But after you've lived here awhile you get to  know that niggers ain't fit for freedom.\"    Silence from Stephen.    \"Likely gal, that beauty,\" Eliphalet continued unrepressed. \"There's a  well-known New Orleans dealer named Jenkins after her. I callate she'll  go down river.\"    \"I reckon you're right, Mistah,\" a man with a matted beard chimed in,  and added with a wink: \"She'll find it pleasant enough--fer a while.  Some of those other niggers will go too, and they'd rather go to hell.  They do treat 'em nefarious down thah on the wholesale plantations.  Household niggers! there ain't none better off than them. But seven  years in a cotton swamp,--seven years it takes, that's all, Mistah.\"    Stephen moved away. He felt that to stay near the man was to be  tempted to murder. He moved away, and just then the auctioneer yelled,  \"Attention!\"    \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"I have heah two sisters, the prope'ty of the  late Mistah Robe't Benbow, of St. Louis, as fine a pair of wenches as  was ever offe'd to the public from these heah steps--\"    \"Speak for the handsome gal,\" cried a wag.    \"Sell off the cart hoss fust,\" said another.    The auctioneer turned to the darker sister:    \"Sal ain't much on looks, gentlemen,\" he said, \"but she's the best  nigger for work Mistah Benbow had.\" He seized her arm and squeezed it,  while the girl flinched and drew back. \"She's solid, gentlemen, and  sound as a dollar, and she kin sew and cook. Twenty-two years old. What  am I bid?\"    Much to the auctioneer's disgust, Sal was bought in for four hundred  dollars, the interest in the beautiful sister having made the crowd  impatient. Stephen, sick at heart, turned to leave. Halfway to the  corner he met a little elderly man who was the color of a dried gourd.  And just as Stephen passed him, this man was overtaken by an old  negress, with tears streaming down her face, who seized the threadbare  hem of his coat. Stephen paused involuntarily.    \"Well, Nancy,\" said the little man, \"we had marvellous luck. I was able  to buy your daughter for you with less than the amount of your savings.\"    \"T'ank you, Mistah Cantah,\" wailed the poor woman, \"t'ank you, suh.  Praised be de name ob de Lawd. He gib me Sal again. Oh, Mistah Cantah\"  (the agony in that cry), \"is you gwineter stan' heah an' see her sister  Hester sol' to--to--oh, ma little Chile! De little Chile dat I nussed,  dat I raised up in God's 'ligion. Mistah Cantah, save her, suh, f'om dat  wicked life o' sin. De Lawd Jesus'll rewa'd you, suh.

Indeed, the crown alone betokened majesty; in all else the  Scarecrow King was but a simple scarecrow--flimsy, awkward, and  unsubstantial.    But if the strange appearance of his Majesty the Scarecrow seemed startling  to Jack, no less wonderful was the form of the Pumpkinhead to the Scarecrow.  The purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the  wooden joints Tip had manufactured, and the carved face on the pumpkin  grinned perpetually, as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing  imaginable.    At first, indeed, His Majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him,  and was inclined to resent such a liberty; but it was not without reason  that the Scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage  in the Land of Oz. He made a more careful examination of his visitor, and  soon discovered that Jack's features were carved into a smile and that he  could not look grave if he wished to.    The King was the first to speak. After regarding        73               Line-Art Drawing    Jack for some minutes he said, in a tone of wonder:    \"Where on earth did you come from, and how do you happen to be alive?\"    \"I beg your Majesty's pardon,\" returned the Pumpkinhead; \"but I do not  understand you.\"        74    \"What don't you understand?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"Why, I don't understand your language. You see, I came from the Country of  the Gillikins, so that I am a foreigner.\"    \"Ah, to be sure!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow. \"I myself speak the language of  the Munchkins, which is also the language of the Emerald City. But you, I  suppose, speak the language of the Pumpkinheads?\"    \"Exactly so, your Majesty\" replied the other, bowing; \"so it will be  impossible for us to understand one another.\"    \"That is unfortunate, certainly,\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. \"We must  have an interpreter.\"    \"What is an interpreter?\" asked Jack.    \"A person who understands both my language and your own. When I say  anything, the interpreter can tell you what I mean; and when you say  anything the interpreter can tell me what you mean. For the interpreter can  speak both languages as well as understand them.\"    \"That is certainly clever,\" said Jack, greatly pleased at finding so simple  a way out of the difficulty.    So the Scarecrow commanded the Soldier with the Green Whiskers to search  among his people        75  until he found one who understood the language of the Gillikins as well as  the language of the Emerald City, and to bring that person to him at once.    When the Soldier had departed the Scarecrow said:    \"Won't you take a chair while we are waiting?\"    \"Your Majesty forgets that I cannot understand you,\" replied the  Pumpkinhead. \"If you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do  so.\" The Scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a  position behind the Pumpkinhead. Then he gave Jack a sudden push that sent  him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up  like a jackknife, and had hard work to untangle himself.    \"Did you understand that sign?\" asked His Majesty, politely.    \"Perfectly,\" declared Jack, reaching up his arms to turn his head to the  front, the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it.    \"You seem hastily made,\" remarked the Scarecrow, watching Jack's efforts to  straighten himself.    \"Not more so than your Majesty,\" was the frank reply.    \"There is this difference between us,\" said the Scarecrow, \"that whereas I  will bend, but not break, you will break, but not bend.\"        76               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"HE GAVE JACK A SUDDEN PUSH\"        77    At this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand. She  seemed very sweet and modest, having a pretty face and beautiful green eyes  and hair. A dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees, showing silk  stockings embroidered with pea-pods, and green satin slippers with bunches  of lettuce for decorations instead of bows or buckles. Upon her silken waist  clover leaves were embroidered, and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed  with sparkling emeralds of a uniform size.    \"Why, it's little Jellia Jamb!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, as the green maiden  bowed her pretty head before him. \"Do you understand the language of the  Gillikins, my dear?\"    \"Yes, your Majesty,\" she answered, \"for I was born in the North Country.\"    \"Then you shall be our interpreter,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and explain to  this Pumpkinhead all that I say, and also explain to me all that he says. Is  this arrangement satisfactory?\" he asked, turning toward his guest.    \"Very satisfactory indeed,\" was the reply.    \"Then ask him, to begin with,\" resumed the Scarecrow, turning to Jellia,  \"what brought him to the Emerald City.\"    But instead of this the girl, who had been staring at Jack, said to him:        78    \"You are certainly a wonderful creature. Who made you?\"    \"A boy named Tip,\" answered Jack.    \"What does he say?\" inquired the Scarecrow. \"My ears must have deceived me.  What did he say?\"    \"He says that your Majesty's brains seem to have come loose,\" replied the  girl, demurely.    The Scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne, and felt of his head with his  left hand.    \"What a fine thing it is to understand two different languages,\" he said,  with a perplexed sigh. \"Ask him, my dear, if he has any objection to being  put in jail for insulting the ruler of the Emerald City.\"    \"I didn't insult you!\" protested Jack, indignantly.    \"Tut--tut!\" cautioned the Scarecrow \"wait, until Jellia translates my  speech. What have we got an interpreter for, if you break out in this rash  way?\"    \"All right, I'll wait,\" replied the Pumpkinhead, in a surly tone--although  his face smiled as genially as ever. \"Translate the speech, young woman.\"    \"His Majesty inquires if you are hungry, said Jellia.    \"Oh, not at all!\" answered Jack, more pleasantly, \"for it is impossible for  me to eat.\"    \"It's the same way with me,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"What did he say,  Jellia, my dear?\"        79    \"He asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger than the  other,\" said the girl, mischievously.    \"Don't you believe her, your Majesty, cried Jack.    \"Oh, I don't,\" answered the Scarecrow, calmly. Then, casting a sharp look at  the girl, he asked:    \"Are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the Gillikins  and the Munchkins?\"    \"Quite certain, your Majesty,\" said Jellia Jamb, trying hard not to laugh in  the face of royalty.    \"Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?\" inquired the  Scarecrow.    \"Because they are one and the same!\" declared the girl, now laughing  merrily. \"Does not your Majesty know that in all the land of Oz but one  language is spoken?\"    \"Is it indeed so?\" cried the Scarecrow, much relieved to hear this; \"then I  might easily have been my own interpreter!\"    \"It was all my fault, your Majesty,\" said Jack, looking rather foolish, \"I  thought we must surely speak different languages, since we came from  different countries.\"    \"This should be a warning to you never to think,\" returned the Scarecrow,  severely. \"For        80  unless one can think wisely it is better to remain a dummy--which you most  certainly are.\"    \"I am!--I surely am!\" agreed the Pumpkinhead.    \"It seems to me,\" continued the Scarecrow, more mildly, \"that your  manufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man.\"    \"I assure your Majesty that I did not ask to be created,\" answered Jack.    \"Ah! It was the same in my case,\" said the King, pleasantly. \"And so, as we  differ from all ordinary people, let us become friends.\"    \"With all my heart!\" exclaimed Jack.    \"What! Have you a heart?\" asked the Scarecrow, surprised.    \"No; that was only imaginative--I might say, a figure of speech,\" said the  other.    \"Well, your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood; so I must  beg you to restrain an imagination which, having no brains, you have no  right to exercise,\" suggested the Scarecrow, warningly.    \"To be sure!\" said Jack, without in the least comprehending.    His Majesty then dismissed Jellia Jamb and the Soldier with the Green  Whiskers, and when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and led  him into the courtyard to play a game of quoits.        81               Full page line-art drawing.        82               Full page line-art drawing.        83               Gen. Jinjur's Army of Revolt      Tip was so anxious to rejoin his man Jack and the Saw-Horse that he walked a  full half the distance to the Emerald City without stopping to rest. Then he  discovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided  for the Journey had all been eaten.    While wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl  sitting by the roadside. She wore a costume that struck the boy as being  remarkably brilliant: her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt  of four distinct colors--blue in front, yellow at the left side, red at  the back and purple at the right side. Fastening        84  the waist in front were four buttons--the top one blue, the next yellow, a  third red and the last purple.                     Line-Art Drawing        The splendor of this dress was almost barbaric; so Tip was fully justified  in staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by  the        85  pretty face above it. Yes, the face was pretty enough, he decided; but it  wore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity.    While the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly. A lunch basket stood  beside her, and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hard-boiled egg  in the other, eating with an evident appetite that aroused Tip's sympathy.    He was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up"]]]
