All day long the fight continued, both parties being strongly reinforced  from time to time; but in fighting of this kind the discipline of the  French soldiers, and the military knowledge of their officers, gave them  a great advantage over the Italians, who fought with desperate bravery,  but without that order and community of effort essential in such a  struggle. In vain did Garibaldi and Colonel Medici, the best of his  officers, expose themselves recklessly in their endeavours to get their  men to attack in military order and to concentrate their efforts at the  given point; in vain did the soldiers show a contempt for death beyond  all praise. When night fell the French still held possession of the  outposts they had gained, and the Italians fell back within the walls.    That night Garibaldi held a council of war, at which Captain Percival  was present. The latter and Colonel Medici were strongly of opinion that  a renewal of the fighting of that day would be disastrous. The loss had  already been very great, and it had been proved that, however valiantly  they fought, the volunteers were unable to wrest the strong positions  held by a superior force of well-disciplined men; for the French army  now numbered forty thousand, while that of the defenders was but twelve  thousand, and of these more than half had joined within the last three  weeks. A series of such failures as those they had encountered would  very quickly break the spirit of the young troops, and would but  precipitate the end. These opinions prevailed, and it was decided that  for the present they should remain on the defensive, maintaining a heavy  cannonade from the walls, and making occasional sorties to harass the  besiegers. In the meantime, the bridge across the Tiber should be  destroyed, and, if possible, mines should be driven to blow up the  batteries that would be erected by the French under cover of the  positions they held.    These tactics were followed out. The French engaged upon the erection of  the batteries were harassed by a continuous cannonade. Sorties were  frequently made, but these were ere long abandoned; the loss suffered on  each occasion being so heavy that the troops no longer fought with the  courage and enthusiasm that had so animated them during the first day's  fighting. The attempt to blow up the bridge across the river by means of  a barge loaded with explosives failed, and none of the defenders  possessed the knowledge that would have enabled them to blow in the  centres of the arches. The mines were equally unsuccessful, as the  French countermined, and by letting in the water formed a streamlet that  ran into the Tiber, filled the Italian works, and compelled the  defenders to desist from their labours. Nevertheless, the progress of  the siege was hindered; and although it was certain that the city, if  unaided, must fall ere long, Mazzini still clung to the hope that the  treaty made by Lesseps and carried by him to Paris would be recognised.  This last hope was crushed by the arrival of a French envoy with the  declaration that the French Government disavowed any participation in  the Convention signed by M. de Lesseps.    Even Garibaldi now admitted that further resistance would only bring  disaster upon the city, and cause an absolutely useless loss of life.  Mazzini and his two colleagues persisted in their resolution to defend  the town to the last, even if the French laid it in ashes, and they even  reproached Garibaldi with cowardice. On the night of the 21st the French  gained possession of the San Pancrazio gate, having driven a passage up  to it unnoticed by the defenders. They at once seized the wall and  captured two bastions, after a desperate defence by Garibaldi. They then  planted cannon upon these and began to bombard the city. Twelve guns  were also planted in a breach that had been effected in the wall, and  terrible havoc was made among the villas and palaces in the western part  of the city.    Roselli proposed that the whole defending force should join in an attack  on the French batteries; but to that Garibaldi would not consent, on the  grounds that these could not be carried without immense loss, and that,  even if captured, they could not be held against the force the French  would bring up to retake them. Gradually the assailants pushed their way  forward, encountering a determined resistance at the capture of the  Villa Savorelli. On the evening of the 27th no fewer than four hundred  of its defenders fell by bayonet wounds, showing how desperately they  had contested every foot of the advance. On the morning of the 30th  three heavy columns of French advanced simultaneously, and carried the  barricades the Romans had erected. Garibaldi, with the most determined  of his men, flung himself upon the enemy; and for a time the desperation  with which they fought arrested the advance. But it was a last effort,  and Garibaldi sent to Mazzini to say that further resistance was  impossible.    He was summoned before the triumvirate, and there stated that, unless  they were resolved to make Rome a second Saragossa, there was no  possible course but to surrender. In the end the triumvirate resigned,  issuing a proclamation that the republic gave up a defence which had  become impossible. The assembly then appointed Garibaldi as dictator,  and he opened negotiations with the French. So enthusiastic were the  citizens that, in spite of the disasters that had befallen them, many  were still in favour of erecting barricades in every street and  defending every house. The majority, however, acquiesced in Garibaldi's  decision that further resistance would be a crime, since it would only  entail immense loss of life and the destruction of the city. For three  days negotiations were carried on, and then Garibaldi, with four  thousand men, left the city and marched for Tuscany, while the French  occupied Rome. But in Tuscany the patriots met with but a poor  reception, for the people, though favourable, dared not receive them.  The French had followed in hot pursuit; the Austrians in Tuscany were on  the look-out for them; and at last, exhausted and starving, they took  refuge in the little republic of San Marino. Here they were kindly  received; but an Austrian army was advancing, and the authorities of the  republic were constrained to petition that the Garibaldians, now reduced  to but fifteen hundred men, should be allowed to capitulate, and that  they themselves should not be punished for having given them refuge.    These terms were granted, but the Archduke insisted upon Garibaldi  himself surrendering. The general, however, effected his escape with his  wife and twelve followers, embarking on board a fishing-boat, and they  reached the mouth of the Po; the rest of the band were permitted by the  Austrians to return to their homes. Garibaldi, alone, with his dying  wife, was able to conceal himself among some bushes near the river; his  companions were all taken by the Austrians and shot. Nine other boats,  laden with his followers, could not get off before the pursuing  Austrians arrived; and a heavy fire being directed upon them, they were  forced to surrender. Garibaldi's faithful wife, who had been his  companion throughout all his trials, died a few days later. The Austrian  pursuit was so hot that he was forced to leave her body; and after many  dangers, he reached Genoa. He was not allowed to remain in Sardinia; and  from thence took ship to Liverpool, and there embarked for New York.    Fortunately for Captain Percival, he and Professor Forli had, when on  June 27th Garibaldi himself recognised that all further resistance was  useless, determined to leave the city. When he stated his decision to  Garibaldi, the latter warmly approved.    \"You have done all that could be done, comrade,\" he said; \"it would be  worse than folly for you to remain here, and throw away your life. Would  that all my countrymen had fought as nobly for freedom as you have done,  for a cause that is not yours!\"    \"I have a right to consider it so, having made Rome my home for years,  and being married to the daughter of a Roman. However, we may again  fight side by side, for assuredly this will not be the last time that an  attempt will be made to drive out the despots; and I feel sure that  Italy will yet be free. I trust that you do not mean to stay here until  it is too late to retire. You must remember that your life is of the  greatest value to the cause, and that it is your duty, above all things,  to preserve it for your country.\"    \"I mean to do so,\" Garibaldi said. \"As soon as all see that further  resistance is useless, I shall leave Rome. If I find that any spark of  life yet remains in the movement, I shall try to fan it into flame; if  not, I shall again cross the Atlantic until my country calls for me.\"    That evening Captain Percival and the professor left the town. There  was no difficulty in doing so, as the whole French force was  concentrated at the point of attack. The professor had exchanged his  ordinary clothes for some of his companion's, and their appearance was  that of two English tourists, when in the morning they entered Ostia, at  the mouth of the Tiber, by the road leading from Albano. As many  fugitives from Rome had, during the past month, embarked from the little  port, and it was no unusual thing for English tourists to find their way  down there, they had no difficulty in chartering a fishing-craft to take  them to Leghorn, it being agreed that they should be landed a mile or  two from the town, so that they could walk into it without attracting  any attention, as they would assuredly be asked for passports were they  to land at the port.    The voyage was altogether unattended by incident; and on landing they  made a detour and entered the town from the west, sauntering quietly  along, as if they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#7)"],[1,"Nora in form. My mother did not dare to break  this news to me, and you may be sure that Nora herself kept it a secret:  it was only by chance that I discovered it.    Shall I tell you how? The minx had been to see me one day, as I sat up  in my bed, convalescent; she was in such high spirits, and so gracious  and kind to me, that my heart poured over with joy and gladness, and I  had even for my poor mother a kind word and a kiss that morning. I felt  myself so well that I ate up a whole chicken, and promised my uncle, who  had come to see me, to be ready against partridge-shooting, to accompany  him, as my custom was.    The next day but one was a Sunday, and I had a project for that day  which I determined to realise, in spite of all the doctor's and my  mother's injunctions: which were that I was on no account to leave the  house, for the fresh air would be the death of me.    Well, I lay wondrous quiet, composing a copy of verses, the first I ever  made in my life; and I give them here, spelt as I spelt them in those  days when I knew no better. And though they are not so polished and  elegant as 'Ardelia ease a Love-sick Swain,' and 'When Sol bedecks the  Daisied Mead,' and other lyrical effusions of mine which obtained me  so much reputation in after life, I still think them pretty good for a  humble lad of fifteen:--    THE ROSE OF FLORA.    Sent by a Young Gentleman of Quality to Miss Brady, of Castle Brady.     On Brady's tower there grows a flower,     It is the loveliest flower that blows,--   At Castle Brady there lives a lady    (And how I love her no one knows):   Her name is Nora, and the goddess Flora    Presents her with this blooming rose.    'O Lady Nora,' says the goddess Flora,    'I've many a rich and bright parterre;   In Brady's towers there's seven more flowers,    But you're the fairest lady there:   Not all the county, nor Ireland's bounty,    Can projuice a treasure that's half so fair!     What cheek is redder? sure roses fed her!    Her hair is maregolds, and her eye of blew   Beneath her eyelid is like the vi'let,    That darkly glistens with gentle jew?   The lily's nature is not surely whiter    Than Nora's neck is,--and her arrums too.    'Come, gentle Nora,' says the goddess Flora,    'My dearest creature, take my advice,   There is a poet, full well you know it,    Who spends his lifetime in heavy sighs,--   Young Redmond Barry, 'tis him you'll marry,    If rhyme and raisin you'd choose likewise.'    On Sunday, no sooner was my mother gone to church, than I summoned Phil  the valet, and insisted upon his producing my best suit, in which I  arrayed myself (although I found that I had shot up so in my illness  that the old dress was wofully too small for me), and, with my notable  copy of verses in my hand, ran down towards Castle Brady, bent upon  beholding my beauty. The air was so fresh and bright, and the birds sang  so loud amidst the green trees, that I felt more elated than I had been  for months before, and sprang down the avenue (my uncle had cut down  every stick of the trees, by the way) as brisk as a young fawn. My heart  began to thump as I mounted the grass-grown steps of the terrace, and  passed in by the rickety hall-door. The master and mistress were at  church, Mr. Screw the butler told me (after giving a start back at  seeing my altered appearance, and gaunt lean figure), and so were six of  the young ladies.    'Was Miss Nora one?' I asked.    'No, Miss Nora was not one,' said Mr. Screw, assuming a very puzzled,  and yet knowing look.    'Where was she?' To this question he answered, or rather made believe  to answer, with usual Irish ingenuity, and left me to settle whether she  was gone to Kilwangan on the pillion behind her brother, or whether she  and her sister had gone for a walk, or whether she was ill in her room;  and while I was settling this query, Mr. Screw left me abruptly.    I rushed away to the back court, where the Castle Brady stables stand,  and there I found a dragoon whistling the 'Roast Beef of Old England,'  as he cleaned down a cavalry horse. 'Whose horse, fellow, is that?'  cried I.    'Feller, indeed!' replied the Englishman: 'the horse belongs to my  captain, and he's a better FELLER nor you any day.'    I did not stop to break his bones, as I would on another occasion, for  a horrible suspicion had come across me, and I made for the garden as  quickly as I could.    I knew somehow what I should see there. I saw Captain Quin and Nora  pacing the alley together. Her arm was under his, and the scoundrel was  fondling and squeezing the hand which lay closely nestling against his  odious waistcoat. Some distance beyond them was Captain Fagan of the  Kilwangan regiment, who was paying court to Nora's sister Mysie.    I am not afraid of any man or ghost; but as I saw that sight my knees  fell a-trembling violently under me, and such a sickness came over me,  that I was fain to sink down on the grass by a tree against which I  leaned, and lost almost all consciousness for a minute or two: then  I gathered myself up, and, advancing towards the couple on the walk,  loosened the blade of the little silver-hilted hanger I always wore in  its scabbard; for I was resolved to pass it through the bodies of the  delinquents, and spit them like two pigeons. I don't tell what feelings  else besides those of rage were passing through my mind; what bitter  blank disappointment, what mad wild despair, what a sensation as if the  whole world was tumbling from under me; I make no doubt that my reader  hath been jilted by the ladies many times, and so bid him recall his own  sensations when the shock first fell upon him.    'No, Norelia,' said the Captain (for it was the fashion of those times  for lovers to call themselves by the most romantic names out of novels),  'except for you and four others, I vow before all the gods, my heart has  never felt the soft flame!'    'Ah! you men, you men, Eugenio!' said she (the beast's name was John),  'your passion is not equal to ours. We are like--like some plant I've  read of--we bear but one flower and then we die!'    'Do you mean you never felt an inclination for another?' said Captain  Quin.    'Never, my Eugenio, but for thee! How can you ask a blushing nymph such  a question?'    'Darling Norelia!' said he, raising her hand to his lips.    I had a knot of cherry-coloured ribands, which she had given me out of  her breast, and which somehow I always wore upon me. I pulled these out  of my bosom, and flung them in Captain Quin's face, and rushed out with  my little sword drawn, shrieking, 'She's a liar--she's a liar, Captain  Quin! Draw, sir, and defend yourself, if you are a man!' and with these  words I leapt at the monster, and collared him, while Nora made the air  echo with her screams; at the sound of which the other captain and Mysie  hastened up.    Although I sprang up like a weed in my illness, and was now nearly  attained to my full growth of six feet, yet I was but a lath by the side  of the enormous English captain, who had calves and shoulders such as no  chairman at Bath ever boasted. He turned very red, and then exceedingly  pale at my attack upon him, and slipped back and clutched at his  sword--when Nora, in an agony of terror, flung herself round him,  screaming, 'Eugenio! Captain Quin, for Heaven's sake spare the child--he  is but an infant.'    'And ought to be whipped for his impudence,' said the Captain; 'but  never fear, Miss Brady, I shall not touch him; your FAVOURITE is safe  from me.' So saying, he stooped down and picked up the bunch of ribands  which had fallen at Nora's feet, and handing it to her, said in a  sarcastic tone, 'When ladies make presents to gentlemen, it is time for  OTHER gentlemen to retire.'    'Good heavens, Quin!' cried the girl; 'he is but a boy.'    'I am a man,' roared I, 'and will prove it.'    'And don't signify any more than my parrot or lap-dog. Mayn't I give a  bit of riband to my own cousin?'    'You are perfectly welcome, miss,' continued the Captain, 'as many yards  as you like.'    'Monster!' exclaimed the dear girl; 'your father was a tailor, and  you are always thinking of the shop. But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Reddy, will you see me insulted?'    'Indeed, Miss Nora,' says I, 'I intend to have his blood as sure as my  name's Redmond.'    'I'll send for the usher to cane you, little boy,' said the Captain,  regaining his self-possession; 'but as for you, miss, I have the honour  to wish you a good-day.'    He took off his hat with much ceremony, made a low CONGE, and was just  walking off, when Mick, my cousin, came up, whose ear had likewise been  caught by the scream.    'Hoity-toity! Jack Quin, what's the matter here?' says Mick; 'Nora in  tears, Redmond's ghost here with his sword drawn, and you making a bow?'    'I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Brady,' said the Englishman: 'I have had  enough of Miss Nora, here, and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em,  sir.'    'Well, well! what is it?' said Mick good-humouredly (for he owed Quin a  great deal of money as it turned out); 'we'll make you used to our ways,  or adopt English ones.'    'It's not the English way for ladies to have two lovers' (the 'Henglish  way,' as the captain called it), 'and so, Mr. Brady, I'll thank you  to pay me the sum you owe me, and I'll resign all claims to this young  lady. If she has a fancy for schoolboys, let her take 'em, sir.'    'Pooh, pooh! Quin, you are joking,' said Mick.    'I never was more in earnest,' replied the other.    'By Heaven, then, look to yourself!' shouted Mick. 'Infamous seducer!  infernal deceiver!--you come and wind your toils round this suffering  angel here--you win her heart and leave her--and fancy her brother won't  defend her? Draw this minute, you slave! and let me cut the wicked heart  out of your body!'    'This is regular assassination,' said Quin, starting back; 'there's two  on 'em on me at once. Fagan, you won't"]]]
