Having therefore no corn or grain of their own growth, they  are obliged to fetch it from other places;4 and Hashem, Mohammed's great-  grandfather, then prince of his tribe, the more effectually to supply them  with provisions, appointed two caravans to set out yearly for that purpose,  the one in summer, and the other in winter: 5 these caravans of purveyors are  mentioned in the Korân.  The provisions brought by them were distributed also  twice a year, viz., in the month of Rajeb, and at the arrival of the pilgrims.  They are supplied with dates in great plenty from the adjacent country, and  with grapes from Tayef, about sixty miles distant, very few growing at Mecca.  The inhabitants of this city are generally very rich, being considerable  gainers by the prodigious concourse of people of almost all nations at the  yearly pilgrimage, at which time there is a great fair or mart for all kinds  of merchandise.  They have also great numbers of cattle, and particularly of  camels: however, the poorer sort cannot but live very indifferently in a place  where almost every necessary of life must be purchased with money.

Medina, which till Mohammed's retreat thither was called Yathreb, is a  walled city about half as big as Mecca,7 built in a plain, salt in many  places, yet tolerably fruitful, particularly in dates, but more especially  near the mountains, two of which, Ohod on the north, and Air on the south, are  about two leagues distant.  Here lies Mohammed interred1 in a magnificent  building, covered with a cupola, and adjoining to the east side of the great  temple, which is built in the midst of the city.2     The province of Tehâma was so named from the vehement heat of its sandy  soil, and is also called Gaur from its low situation; it is bounded on the  west by the Red Sea, and on the other sides by Hejâz and Yaman, extending  almost from Mecca to Aden.3     The province of Najd, which word signifies a rising country, lies between  those of Yamâma, Yaman, and Hejâz, and is bounded on the east by Irak.4     The province of Yamâma, also called Arûd from its oblique situation, in  respect of Yaman, is surrounded by the provinces of Najd, Tehâma, Bahrein,  Omân, Shihr, Hadramaut, and Saba.  The chief city is Yamâma, which gives name  to the province: it was anciently called Jaw, and is particularly famous for  being the residence of Mohammed's competitor, the false prophet Moseilama.5     The Arabians, the inhabitants of this spacious country, which they have  possessed from the most remote antiquity, are distinguished by their own  writers into two classes, viz., the old lost Arabians, and the present.     The former were very numerous, and divided into several tribes, which are  now all destroyed, or else lost and swallowed up among the other tribes, nor  are any certain memoirs or records extant concerning them;6 though the memory  of some very remarkable events and the catastrophe of some tribes have been  preserved by tradition, and since confirmed by the authority of the Korân.     The most famous tribes amongst these ancient Arabians were Ad, Thamûd,  Tasm, Jadîs, the former Jorham, and Amalek.       6  Sharif al Edrisi ubi supra, 125. 7  Id. Vulgò Geogr. Nubiensis, 5.     1  Though the notion of Mohammed's being buried at Mecca has been so long  exploded, yet several modern writers, whether through ignorance or negligence  I will not determine, have fallen into it.  It shall here take notice only of  two; one is Dr. Smith, who having lived some time in Turkey, seems to be  inexcusable: that gentleman in his Epistles de Moribus ac Institutis Turcarum,  no less than thrice mentions the Mohammedans visiting the tomb of their  prophet at Mecca, and once his being born at Medina-the reverse of which is  true (see Ep. I, p. 22, Ep. 2, p. 63 and 64).  The other is the publisher of  the last edition of Sir J. Mandevile's Travels, who on his author's saying  very truly (p. 50) that the said tomb was at Methone, i.e., Medina, undertakes  to correct the name of the town, which is something corrupted, by putting at  the bottom of the page, Mecca.  The Abbot de Vertot, in his History of the  Order of Malta (vol. i. p. 410, ed. 8vo.), seems also to have confounded these  two cities together, though he had before mentioned Mohammed's sepulchre at  Medina.  However, he is certainly mistaken, when he says that one point of the  religion, both of the Christians and Mohammedans, was to visit, at least once  in their lives, the tomb of the author of their respective faith.  Whatever  may be the opinion of some Christians, I am well assured the Mohammedans think  themselves under no manner of obligation in that respect.  2  Gol. ad Alfragan. 97, Abulfeda Descr.

The tribe of Ad were descended from Ad, the son of Aws,1 the son of Aram,2  the son of Sem, the son of Noah, who, after the confusion of tongues, settled  in al Ahkâf, or the winding sands in the province of Hadramaut, where his  posterity greatly multiplied.  Their first king was Shedâd the son of Ad, of  whom the eastern writers deliver many fabulous things, particularly that he  finished the magnificent city his father had begun, wherein he built a fine  palace, adorned with delicious gardens, to embellish which he spared neither  cost nor labour, proposing thereby to create in his subjects a superstitious  veneration of himself as a god.3  This garden or paradise was called the  garden of Irem, and is mentioned in the Korân,4 and often alluded to by the  oriental writers.  The city, they tell us, is still standing in the deserts of  Aden, being preserved by providence as a monument of divine justice, though it  be invisible, unless very rarely, when GOD permits it to be seen, a favour one  Colabah pretended to have received in the reign of the Khalîf Moâwiyah, who  sending for him to know the truth of the matter, Colabah related his whole  adventure; that as he was seeking a camel he had lost, he found himself on a  sudden at the gates of this city, and entering it saw not one inhabitant, at  which, being terrified, he stayed no longer than to take with him some fine  stones which he showed the Khalîf.5     The descendants of Ad in process of time falling from the worship of the  true God into idolatry, GOD sent the prophet Hûd (who is generally agreed to  be Heber6) to preach to and reclaim them.  But they refusing to acknowledge  his mission, or to obey him, GOD sent a hot and suffocating wind, which blew  seven nights and eight days together, and entering at their nostrils passed  through their bodies.7 and destroyed them all, a very few only excepted, who  had believed in Hûd and retired with him to another place.8  That prophet  afterwards returned into Hadramaut, and was buried near Hasec, where there is  a small town now standing called Kabr Hûd, or the sepulchre of Hûd.  Before  the Adites were thus severely punished, GOD, to humble them, and incline them  to hearken to the preaching of his prophet, afflicted them with a drought for  four years, so that all their cattle perished, and themselves were very near  it; upon which they sent Lokmân (different from one of the same name who lived  in David's time) with sixty others to Mecca to beg rain, which they not  obtaining, Lokmân with some of his company stayed at Mecca, and thereby  escaped destruction, giving rise to a tribe called the latter Ad, who were  afterward changed into monkeys.1     Some commentators on the Korân2 tell us these old Adites were of prodigious  stature, the largest being 100 cubits high, and the least 60; which  extraordinary size they pretend to prove by the testimony of the Korân.3     The tribe of Thamûd were the posterity of Thamûd the son of Gather4 the son  of Aram, who falling into idolatry, the prophet Sâleh was sent to bring them  back to the worship of the true GOD.  This prophet lived between the time of  Hûd and of Abraham, and therefore cannot be the       1  Or Uz.  Gen. x. 22, 23.  2  Vide Kor. c. 89.

It is, however, possible that the singular instinct of tho southern  puma, which is unique among animals in a state of nature, is not  possessed by the entire species, ranging as it does over a hundred  degrees of latitude, from British North America to Tierra del Fuego. The  widely different conditions of life in the various regions it inhabits  must necessarily have caused some divergence. Concerning its habits in  the dense forests of the Amazonian region, where it must have developed  special instincts suited to its semi-arboreal life, scarcely anything  has been recorded. Everyone is, however, familiar with the dreaded  cougar, catamount, or panther--sometimes called \"painter\"--of North  American literature, thrilling descriptions of encounters with this  imaginary man-eating monster being freely scattered through the  backwoods or border romances, many of them written by authors who have  the reputation of being true to nature. It may be true that this cougar  of a cold climate did occasionally attack man, or, as it is often  stated, follow him in the forest with the intention of springing on him  unawares; but on this point nothing definite will ever be known, as the  pioneers hunters of the past were only anxious to shoot cougar and not  to study its instinct and disposition. It is now many years since  Audubon and Bachman wrote, \"This animal, which has excited so much  terror in the minds of the ignorant and timid, has been nearly  exterminated in all the Atlantic States, and we do not recollect a  single well-authenticated instance where any hunter's life fell a  sacrifice in a cougar hunt.\" It might be added, I believe, that no  authentic instance has been recorded of the puma making an unprovoked  attack on any human being. In South America also the traveller in the  wilderness is sometimes followed by a puma; but he would certainly be  very much surprised if told that it follows with the intention of  springing on him unawares and devouring his flesh.    I have spoken of the comparative ease with which the puma overcomes even  large animals, comparing it in this respect with the peregrine falcon;  but all predacious species are liable to frequent failures, sometimes to  fatal mishaps, and even the cunning, swift-killing puma is no exception.  Its attacks are successfully resisted by the ass, which does not, like  the horse, lose his presence of mind, but when assaulted thrusts his  head well down between its fore-legs and kicks violently until the enemy  is thrown or driven off. Pigs, when in large herds, also safely defy the  puma, massing themselves together for defence in their well-known  manner, and presenting a serried line of tusks to the aggressor. During  my stay in Patagonia a puma met its fate in a manner so singular that  the incident caused considerable sensation among the settlers on the Rio  Negro at the time. A man named Linares, the chief of the tame Indians  settled in the neighbourhood of El Carmen, while riding near the river  had his curiosity aroused by the appearance and behaviour of a young cow  standing alone in the grass, her head, armed with long and exceedingly  sharp horns, much raised, and watching his approach in a manner which  betokened a state of dangerous excitement. She had recently dropped her  calf, and he at once conjectured that it had been attacked, and perhaps  killed, by some animal of prey. To satisfy himself on this point he  began to search for it, and while thus engaged the cow repeatedly  charged him with the greatest fury. Presently he discovered the calf  lying dead among the long grass; and by its side lay a full-grown puma,  also dead, and with a large wound in its side, just behind the shoulder.  The calf had been killed by the puma, for its throat showed the wounds  of large teeth, and the puma had been killed by the cow. When he saw it  he could, he affirmed, scarcely believe the evidence of his own senses,  for was an unheard-of thing that a puma should be injured by any other  animal. His opinion was that it had come down from the hills in a  starving condition, and having sprung upon the calf, the taste of blood  had made it for a moment careless of its own safety, and during that  moment the infuriated cow had charged, and driving one of her long sharp  horns into some vital part, killed it instantly.    The puma is, with the exception of some monkeys, the most playful animal  in existence. The young of all the Felidae spend a large portion of  their time in characteristic gambols; the adults, however, acquire a  grave and dignified demeanour, only the female playing on occasions with  her offspring; but this she always does with a certain formality of  manner, as if the relaxation were indulged in not spontaneously, but for  the sake of the young and as being a necessary part of their education.  Some writer has described the lion's assumption of gaiety as more grim  than its most serious moods. The puma at heart is always a kitten,  taking unmeasured delight in its frolics, and when, as often happens,  one lives alone in the desert, it will amuse itself by the hour fighting  mock battles or playing at hide-and-seek with imaginary companions, and  lying in wait and putting all its wonderful strategy in practice to  capture a passing butterfly. Azara kept a young male for four months,  which spent its whole time playing with the slaves. This animal, he  says, would not refuse any food offered to it; but when not hungry it  would bury the meat in the sand, and when inclined to eat dig it up,  and, taking it to the water-trough, wash it clean. I have only known one  puma kept as a pet, and this animal, in seven or eight years had never  shown a trace of ill-temper. When approached, he would lie down, purring  loudly, and twist himself about a person's legs, begging to be caressed.  A string or handkerchief drawn about was sufficient to keep him in a  happy state of excitement for an hour; and when one person was tired of  playing with him he was ready for a game with the next comer.    I was told by a person who had spent most of his life on the pampas that  on one occasion, when travelling in the neighbourhood of Cape  Corrientes, his horse died under him, and he was compelled to continue  his journey on foot, burdened with his heavy native horse-gear. At night  he made his bed under the shelter of a rock, on the slope of a stony  sierra; a bright moon was shining, and about nine o'clock in the evening  four pumas appeared, two adults with their two half-grown young. Not  feeling the least alarm at their presence, he did not stir; and after a  while they began to gambol together close to him, concealing themselves  from each other among the rocks, just as kittens do, and frequently  while pursuing one another leaping over him. He continued watching them  until past midnight, then fell asleep, and did not wake until morning,  when they had left him.    This man was an Englishman by birth, but having gone very young to South  America he had taken kindly to the semi-barbarous life of the gauchos,  and had imbibed all their peculiar notions, one of which is that human  life is not worth very much. \"What does it matter?\" they often say, and  shrug their shoulders, when told of a comrade's death; \"so many  beautiful horses die!\" I asked him if he had ever killed a puma, and he  replied that he had killed only one and had sworn never to kill another.  He said that while out one day with another gaucho looking for cattle a  puma was found. It sat up with its back against a stone, and did not  move even when his companion threw the noose of his lasso over its neck.  My informant then dismounted, and, drawing his knife, advanced to kill  it: still the puma made no attempt to free itself from the lasso, but it  seemed to know, he said, what was coming, for it began to tremble, the  tears ran from its eyes, and it whined in the most pitiful manner. He  killed it as it sat there unresisting before him, but after  accomplishing the deed felt that he had committed a murder. It was the  only thing ho had ever done in his life, he added, which filled him with  remorse when he remembered it. This I thought a rather startling  declaration, as I knew that he had killed several individuals of his own  species in duels, fought with knives, in the fashion of the gauchos.    All who have killed or witnessed the killing of the puma--and I have  questioned scores of hunters on this point--agree that it resigns itself  in this unresisting, pathetic manner to death at the hands of man.  Claudio Gay, in his _Natural History of Chili,_ says, \"When attacked by  man its energy and daring at once forsake it, and it becomes a weak,  inoffensive animal, and trembling, and uttering piteous moans, and  shedding abundant tears, it seems to implore compassion from a generous  enemy.\" The enemy is not often generous; but many gauchos have assured  me, when speaking on this subject, that although they kill the puma  readily to protect their domestic animals, they consider it an evil  thing to take its life in desert places, where it is man's only friend  among the wild animals.    When the hunter is accompanied by dogs, then the puma, instead of  drooping and shedding tears, is roused to a sublime rage: its hair  stands erect; its eyes shine like balls of green flame; it spits and  snarls like a furious torn cat. The hunter's presence seems at such  times to be ignored altogether, its whole attention being given to the  dogs and its rage directed against them. In Patagonia a sheep-farming  Scotchman, with whom I spent some days, showed me the skulls of five  pumas which he had shot in the vicinity of his ranche. One was of an  exceptionally"]]]
