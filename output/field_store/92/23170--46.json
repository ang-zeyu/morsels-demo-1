To restore education and religion, Alfred disseminated the Anglo-  Saxon Chronicles; the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of  the English Nation; the \"Consolidation of Philosophy\" by Roman  philosopher Boethius, which related the use of adversity to  develop the soul, and described the goodness of God and how the  highest happiness comes from spiritual values and the soul, which  are eternal, rather than from material or earthly pursuits, which  are temporal; and Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care, which he had  translated into English and was the fundamental book on the duty  of a bishop, which included a duty to teach laymen; and Orosius'  History of the World, which he had translated into English.  Alfred's advice to pastors was to live as they had been taught  from books and to teach this manner of life to others. To be  avoided was pride, the mind's deception of seeking glory in the  name of doing good works, and the corruption of high office. Bede  was England's first scholar, first theologian, and first  historian. He wrote poetry, theological books, homilies, and  textbooks on grammar, rhetoric [public speaking and debating],  arithmetic, and astronomy. He adhered to the doctrine that death  entered the world by the sin of Adam, the first man. He began the  practice of dating years from the birth of Christ and believed  that the earth was round. Over the earth was a fiery spherical  firmament. Above this were the waters of the heavens. Above this  were the upper heavens, which contained the angels and was  tempered with ice. He declared that comets portend downfalls of  kingdoms, pestilence, war, winds, or heat. This reflected the  church's view that a comet was a ball of fire flung from the right  hand of an angry God as a warning to mankind, usually for  disbelief. Storms were begun by the devil.    A famous poem, the oral legend of Beowulf, a hero who led his men  into adventures and performed great feats and fought monsters and  dragons, was put into writing with a Christian theme. In it,  loyalty to one's lord is a paramount virtue. Also available in  writing was the story of King Arthur's twelve victorious battles  against the pagan Saxons, authored by Nennius.    There were professional story tellers attached to great men.  Others wandered from court to court, receiving gifts for their  story telling. Men usually told oral legends of their own feats  and those of their ancestors after supper.    Alfred had monasteries rebuilt with learned and moral men heading  them. He built a nunnery which was headed by his daughter as  prioress. He built a strong wall with four gates around London,  which he had taken into his control. He appointed his son-in-law,  who was one of his eorldormen, to be alderman [older man] to  govern London and to be the shire's earl. A later king built a  palace in London, although Winchester was still the royal capital  town. When the king traveled, he and his retinue were fed by the  local people at their expense.    After Alfred's death, his daughter Aethelflared ruled the country  for seven years. She had more fortified burhs built and led  soldiers to victories.    Under the royalty were the nobles. An earl headed each shire as  representative of the King. The term  \"earl\" came to denote an  office instead of a nobleman. He led the array of his shire to do  battle if the shire was attacked. He executed all royal commands.  An earl received grants of land and could claim hospitality and  maintenance for himself, his officers, and his servants. He  presided over the shire court. He received one-third of the fines  from the profits of justice and collected as well a third of the  revenues derived from tolls and duties levied in the boroughs of  his shire. The office tended to be hereditary. Royal  representatives called \"reeves\" started to assist them. The reeve  took security from every person for the maintenance of the public  peace. He also tracked cattle thieves, brought suspects to court,  gave judgments according to the doom books, and delivered  offenders to punishment.    Under the earls were the thegns. By service to the King, it was  possible for a coerl to rise to become a thegn and to be given  land by the King. Other thegns performed functions of magistrates.  A thegn was later identified as a person with five hides of land,  a kitchen, a church, a bell house, a judicial place at the burh-  gemot [a right of magistracy], and an appointment in the King's  hall. He was bound to to service in war by virtue of his  landholding instead of by his relationship to the king. Nobility  was now a territorial attribute, rather than one of birth. The  wergeld of a thegn was 1200s. when that of a ceorl or ordinary  freeman was 200s. The wergeld of an earl or bishop was four times  that of a thegn: 5800s. The wergeld of a king or archbishop was  six times that of a thegn: 7200s. The higher a man's wergeld, the  higher was his legal status in the scale of punishment, giving  credible evidence, and participation in legal proceedings. The  sokemen were freemen who had inherited their own land, chose their  own lord, and attended and were subject to their lord's court.  That is, their lord has soke [soc] jurisdiction over them. A ceorl  typically had a single hide of land. A smallholder rented land of  about 30 acres from a landlord, which he paid by doing work on the  lord's demesne [household or messuage] land, paying money rent, or  paying a food rent such as in eggs or chickens. Smallholders made  up about two fifths of the population. A cottager had one to five  acres of land and depended on others for his living. Among these  were shepherds, ploughmen, swineherds, and blacksmiths. They also  participated in the agricultural work, especially at harvest time.    It was possible for a thegn to become an earl, probably by the  possession of forty hides. He might even acquire enough land to  qualify him for the witan. Women could be present at the  witenagemot and shire-gemot [meeting of the people of the shire].  They could sue and be sued in the courts. They could independently  inherit, possess, and dispose of property. A wife's inheritance  was her own and under no control of her husband.    Marriage required the consent of the lady and her friends. The man  also had to arrange for the foster lean, that is, remuneration for  rearing and support of expected children. He also declared the  amount of money or land he would give the lady for her consent,  that is, the morgengift, and what he would bequeath her in case of  his death. It was given to her on the morning after the wedding  night. The family of the bride was paid a \"mund\" for transferring  the rightful protection they possessed over her to the family of  the husband. If the husband died and his kindred did not accept  the terms sanctioned by law, her kindred could repurchase the  rightful protection. If she remarried within a year of his death,  she had to forfeit the morgengift and his nearest kin received the  lands and possessions she had. The word for man was \"waepnedmenn\"  or weaponed person. A woman was \"wifmenn\" or wife person, with  \"wif\" being derived from the word for weaving.    Great men and monasteries had millers, smiths, carpenters,  architects, agriculturists, fishermen, weavers, embroiders, dyers,  and illuminators.    For entertainment, minstrels sang ballads about heroes or Bible  stories, harpers played, jesters joked, and tumblers threw and  caught balls and knives. There was gambling, dice games, and  chasing deer with hounds.    Fraternal guilds were established for mutual advantage and  protection. A guild imposed fines for any injury of one member by  another member. It assisted in paying any murder fine imposed on a  member. It avenged the murder of a member and abided by the  consequences. It buried its members and purchased masses for his  soul.    Mercantile guilds in seaports carried out commercial speculations  not possible by the capital of only one person.    There were some ale houses, probably part of certain dwellings.                                      - The Law -    Alfred issued a set of laws to cover the whole country, which were  drawn from the best laws of each region. There was no real  distinction between the concepts of law, morals, and religion.    The importance of telling the truth and keeping one's word are  expressed by this law: \"1.

THE RAMAPO SALAMANDER    A curious tale of the Rosicrucians runs to the effect that more than two  centuries ago a band of German colonists entered the Ramapo valley and  put up houses of stone, like those they had left in the Hartz Mountains,  and when the Indians saw how they made knives and other wonderful things  out of metal, which they extracted from the rocks by fire, they believed  them to be manitous and went away, not wishing to resist their possession  of the land. There was treasure here, for High Tor, or Torn Mountain, had  been the home of Amasis, youngest of the magi who had followed the star  of Bethlehem. He had found his way, through Asia and Alaska, to this  country, had taken to wife a native woman, by whom he had a child, and  here on the summit he had built a temple. Having refused the sun worship,  when the Indians demanded that he should take their faith, he was set  upon, and would have been killed had not an earthquake torn the ground at  his feet, opening a new channel for the Hudson and precipitating into it  every one but the magus and his daughter. To him had been revealed in  magic vision the secrets of wealth in the rocks.    The leader in the German colony, one Hugo, was a man of noble origin, who  had a wife and two children: a boy, named after himself; a girl,--Mary.  Though it had been the custom in the other country to let out the forge  fires once in seven years, Hugo opposed that practice in the forge he had  built as needless. But his men murmured and talked of the salamander that  once in seven years attains its growth in unquenched flame and goes forth  doing mischief. On the day when that period was ended the master entered  his works and saw the men gazing into the furnace at a pale form that  seemed made from flame, that was nodding and turning in the fire,  occasionally darting its tongue at them or allowing its tail to fall out  and lie along the stone floor. As he came to the door he, too, was  transfixed, and the fire seemed burning his vitals, until he felt water  sprinkled on his face, and saw that his wife, whom he had left at home  too ill to move, stood behind him and was casting holy water into the  furnace, speaking an incantation as she did so. At that moment a storm  arose, and a rain fell that put out the fire; but as the last glow faded  the lady fell dead.    When her children were to be consecrated, seven years later, those who  stood outside of the church during the ceremony saw a vivid flash, and  the nurse turned from the boy in her fright. She took her hands from her  eyes. The child was gone. Twice seven years had passed and the daughter  remained unspotted by the world, for, on the night when her father had  led her to the top of High Torn Mountain and shown her what Amasis had  seen,--the earth spirits in their caves heaping jewels and offering to  give them if Hugo would speak the word that binds the free to the earth  forces and bars his future for a thousand years,--it was her prayer that  brought him to his senses and made the scene below grow dim, though the  baleful light of the salamander clinging to the rocks at the bottom of  the cave sent a glow into the sky.    Many nights after that the glow was seen on the height and Hugo was  missing from his home, but for lack of a pure soul to stand as  interpreter he failed to read the words that burned in the triangle on  the salamander's back, and returned in rage and jealousy. A knightly man  had of late appeared in the settlement, and between him and Mary a tender  feeling had arisen, that, however, was unexpressed until, after saving  her from the attack of a panther, he had allowed her to fall into his  arms. She would willingly then have declared her love for him, but he  placed her gently and regretfully from him and said, \"When you slept I  came to you and put a crown of gems on your head: that was because I was  in the power of the earth spirit. Then I had power only over the element  of fire, that either consumes or hardens to stone; but now water and life  are mine. Behold! Wear these, for thou art worthy.\" And touching the  tears that had fallen from her eyes, they turned into lilies in his  hands, and he put them on her brow.    \"Shall we meet again?\" asked the girl.    \"I do not know,\" said he. \"I tread the darkness of the universe alone,  and I peril my redemption by yielding to this love of earth. Thou art  redeemed already, but I must make my way back to God through obedience  tested in trial. Know that I am one of those that left heaven for love of  man. We were of that subtle element which is flame, burning and glowing  with love,--and when thy mother came to me with the power of purity to  cast me out of the furnace, I lost my shape of fire and took that of a  human being,--a child. I have been with thee often, and was rushing to  annihilation, because I could not withstand the ordeal of the senses. Had  I yielded, or found thee other than thou art, I should have become again  an earth spirit. I have been led away by wish for power, such as I have  in my grasp, and forgot the mission to the suffering. I became a wanderer  over the earth until I reached this land, the land that you call new.  Here was to be my last trial and here I am to pass the gate of fire.\"    As he spoke voices arose from the settlement.    \"They are coming,\" said he. The stout form of Hugo was in advance. With a  fierce oath he sprang on the young man. \"He has ruined my household,\" he  cried. \"Fling him into the furnace!\" The young man stood waiting, but his  brow was serene. He was seized, and in a few moments had disappeared  through the mouth of the burning pit. But Mary, looking up, saw a shape  in robes of silvery light, and it drifted upward until it vanished in the  darkness. The look of horror on her face died away, and a peace came to  it that endured until the end.          CHIEF CROTON    Between the island of Manhattoes and the Catskills the Hudson shores were  plagued with spooks, and even as late as the nineteenth century Hans  Anderson, a man who tilled a farm back of Peekskill, was worried into his  grave by the leaden-face likeness of a British spy whom he had hanged on  General Putnam's orders. \"Old Put\" doubtless enjoyed immunity from this  vexatious creature, because he was born with few nerves. A region  especially afflicted was the confluence of the Croton and the Hudson, for  the Kitchawan burying-ground was here, and the red people being disturbed  by the tramping of white men over their graves, \"the walking sachems of  Teller's Point\" were nightly to be met on their errands of protest.    These Indians had built a palisade on Croton Point, and here they made  their last stand against their enemies from the north. Throughout the  fight old chief Croton stood on the wall with arrows showering around  him, and directed the resistance with the utmost calm. Not until every  one of his men was dead and the fort was going up in flame about him did  he confess defeat. Then standing amid the charring timbers, he used his  last breath in calling down the curse of the Great Spirit against the  foe. As the victorious enemy rushed into the enclosure to secure the  scalps of the dead he fell lifeless into the fire, and their jubilant  yell was lost upon his ears. Yet, he could not rest nor bear to leave his  ancient home, even after death, and often his form, in musing attitude,  was seen moving through the woods. When a manor was built on the ruins of  his fort, he appeared to the master of it, to urge him into the  Continental army, and having seen this behest obeyed and laid a solemn  injointure to keep the freedom of the land forever, he vanished, and  never appeared again.          THE RETREAT FROM MAHOPAC    After the English had secured the city of New Amsterdam and had begun to  extend their settlements along the Hudson, the Indians congregated in  large numbers about Lake Mahopac, and rejected all overtures for the  purchase of that region. In their resolution they were sustained by their  young chief Omoyao, who refused to abandon on on any terms the country  where his fathers had solong hunted, fished, and built their lodges. A  half-breed, one Joliper, a member of this tribe, was secretly in the pay  of the English, but the allurements and insinuations that he put forth on  their behalf were as futile as the breathing of wind in the leaves. At  last the white men grew angry. Have the land they would, by evil course  if good ways were refused, and commissioning Joliper to act for them in a  decisive manner, they guaranteed to supply him with forces if his  negotiations fell through. This man never thought it needful to  negotiate. He knew the temper of his tribe and he was too jealous of his  chief to go to him for favors, because he loved Maya, the chosen one of  Omoyao.    At the door of Maya's tent he entreated her to go with him to the white  settlements, and on her refusal he broke into angry threats, declaring,  in the self-forgetfulness of passion, that he would kill her lover and  lead the English against the tribe. Unknown to both Omoyao had overheard  this interview, and he immediately sent runners to tell all warriors of  his people to meet him at once on the island in the lake. Though the  runners were cautioned to keep their errand secret, it is probable that  Joliper suspected that the alarm had gone forth, and he resolved to  strike at once; so he summoned his renegades, stole into camp next  evening and made toward Maya's wigwam, intending to take her to a place  of safety. Seeing the chief at the door, he shot an arrow at him, but the  shaft went wide and slew the girl's father. Realizing, upon this assault,  that he was outwitted and that his people were outnumbered, the chief  called to Maya to meet him at the island, and plunged into the brush,  after seeing that she had taken flight in an opposite direction.
