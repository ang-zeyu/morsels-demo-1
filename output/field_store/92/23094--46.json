But Jabez never had no fondness for any  of his kin. You--you are all alone in the world, child?\"    \"All alone save for Uncle Jabez.\"    She had come near to the old woman again. As she dropped quietly on  her knees Aunt Alviry gathered her head close to her bosom; but Ruth  did not weep any more. She only said:    \"I know I shall love you very, very much, dear Aunt Alvirah. And I  hope I shall help your back and your bones a great deal, too!\"      CHAPTER VIII     HOARDING UP: PASSIONS--MONEY--WATER    This was Ruth Fielding's introduction to the Red Mill, its occupants,  and its surroundings. The spot was, indeed, beautiful, and an hour  after she had arrived she knew that she would love it. The Lumano  River was a wide stream and from the little window of the chamber that  Aunt Alviry said would be her own, she could look both up and down the  river for several miles.    Uncle Jabez had a young man to help him in the mill. It was true, Aunt  Alviry said, that Jasper Parloe had worked for some time at the Red  Mill; but he was quarrelsome and Mr. Potter had declared he was not  honest. When the mill owner was obliged to be absent and people had  come to have corn or wheat ground, paying for the milling instead of  giving toll, Jasper had sometimes kept the money instead of turning it  over to Mr. Potter. This had finally resulted in a quarrel between the  two, and Mr. Potter had discharged Parloe without paying him for his  last month's work.    The young newcomer had learned a great deal about the big mill and the  homestead, and about the work Aunt Alviry had to do, before the first  meal was prepared. She was of much assistance, too, and when Uncle  Jabez came in, after washing at the pump, but bringing a cloud of  flour with him on his clothes, the old woman was seated comfortably in  her chair and Ruth \"dished up the dinner.\"    At the end of his meal her uncle spoke just once to Ruth. \"You have  l'arned to work, I see. Your Aunt Alviry has trouble with her back and  bones. If you make yourself of use to her you can stay here. I expect  all cats to catch mice around the Red Mill. Them that don't goes into  the sluice. There's enough to do here. You won't be idle for want of  work.\"    And this was every word of his welcome, in a tone that showed neither  interest nor care for the girl. It was what help she could be and how  much he could save by her. It was plain enough that Uncle Jabez Potter  was as saving as a person could possibly be. There was none too much  food on the table, and Ruth watched the ravenous hunger of the hired  man, when he came in, with a feeling as though she were watching a  half-starved dog at his meal.    Jabez Potter was not like the misers Ruth had read about, save in his  personal appearance. He was not well dressed, nor was he very clean.  But naturally the mill-dust would stick to him and to his clothing. It  seemed to have worked into the very texture of his skin during all the  years he had controlled the mill, until he was all of a dead gray.    Sometimes there were half a dozen wagons or buggies waiting at the  mill, and not all of them gave toll for their milling. Ruth, in the  afternoon, and because it had begun to rain and she could not go out,  went into the mill to quench her curiosity regarding it. She saw that  there was a tiny office over the water, with a fireproof safe in it.  Her uncle brought the money he took from his customers and put it in a  little locked, japanned box, which he kept upon a shelf. The safe  appeared to be full of ledgers.    Farther down the mill was a wide door and platform overhanging the  water (this was below the dam) where flour and meal could be loaded  upon barges for transportation to Osago Lake, some miles away. There  were great bins of wheat and corn, many elevator pipes, several mills  turning all the time, grinding different grains, and a great  corn-sheller that went by power, and which the young man fed when he  had nothing else to do.    All the time the building trembled and throbbed, and this throbbing  was communicated to the house. As she sat with Aunt Alvirah, and sewed  carpet-rags for a braided mat, the distant thunder of the mills and  the trembling of the machinery made the whole house vibrate.    Late in the afternoon Ruth heard the honking of an auto horn and ran  out upon the covered porch. Between the scuds of rain that drove along  the valley she saw the gray automobile coming slowly past the mill.  There was a man driving it now, and he stopped and let Helen Cameron  out so that she could run up to great Ruth under the shelter of the  porch.    \"Oh, you dear! How are you getting on?\" cried Helen, kissing her  impulsively and as glad to see Ruth as though they had been separated  for days instead of for only a few hours. \"Colfax wanted to drive down  to the station alone for Daddy--for we won't bring poor Tom home in  this rain--but I just couldn't resist coming to see how you were  getting on.\" She looked around with big eyes. \"How does the Ogre treat  you?\" she whispered.    But Ruth could laugh now and did so, saying, cheerfully: \"He hasn't  eaten me up yet! And Aunt Alvirah is the dearest little lady who ever  lived.\"    \"She likes you, then?\"    \"Of course she does.\"    \"I knew she would, she was bound to love you. But I don't know about  the Ogre,\" and she shook her head. \"But there! I must run. We don't  want to be late for the train. That will put Daddy out. And I must  stop and see Tom at the doctor's, too.\"    \"I hope you will find your brother ever so mach better,\" cried Ruth,  as her friend ran down the walk again.    \"You'll see him come by here to-morrow, if it quits raining,\" returned  Helen, over her shoulder.    But it did not stop raining that night, nor for a full week. The scuds  of rain, blowing across the river, slapped sharply against the side of  the house, and against Ruth's window all night. She did not sleep that  first night as well as she had in the charitable home of the station  master and his good wife. The evening meal had been as stiff and  unpleasant as the noon meal. The evening was spent in the same room--  the kitchen. Aunt Alviry knitted and sewed; Uncle Jabez pored over  certain accounts and counted money very softly behind the uplifted  cover of the japanned cash-box that he had brought in from the mill.    She got in time to know that cash-box very well indeed. It often came  into the house under Uncle Jabez's arm at dinner, too. He scarcely  seemed willing to trust it out of his sight. And Ruth was sure that he  locked himself into his room with it at night.    A loaded shotgun lay upon rests over the kitchen door all the time,  and there was a big, two-barreled, muzzle-loading pistol on the stand  beside Uncle Jabez's bed. Ruth was much more afraid of these loaded  weapons than she was of burglars. But the old man evidently expected  to be attacked for his wealth at some time although, Aunt Alvirah told  her, nobody had ever troubled him in all the years she had lived at  the Red Mill.    So it was not fear of marauders that kept Ruth so wakeful on this  first night under her uncle's roof. She thought of all the kind  friends she had left in Darrowtown, and her long journey here, and her  cold welcome to what she supposed would be her future home. Without  Helen, and without Aunt Alvirah, she knew she would have gotten up,  put on her clothing, packed her bag, and run away in the rain to some  other place. She could not have stood Uncle Jabez alone.    Jabez Potter was hoarding up something besides money, too. Ruth did  not understand this until it had already rained several days, and the  roaring of the waters fretting against the river banks and against the  dam, had become all but deafening in her ears.    Then, during a lull in the storm, and on the afternoon that Tom  Cameron was taken home from Dr. Davison's, the old doctor himself  stopped at the mill and shouted for Jabez to come out. The doctor  drove a very fast red and white mare and had difficulty in holding her  in, for she was eager to be moving.    Uncle Jabez came out and seemed to look upon the doctor in no very  friendly way. Ruth, standing at the open door of the kitchen, could  hear Dr. Davison's voice plainly.    \"Jabez,\" he said, \"do you know how the river is at Minturn?\"    \"No,\" returned the miller, briefly.    \"It's higher than it's ever been. That dam is not safe. Why don't you  let your water out so that, if Minturn should break, she'd have free  sweep here and so do less damage below? Let this small flood out and  when the greater one comes there'll be less danger of a disaster.\"    \"And how do I know the Minturn dam will burst, Dr. Davison?\" asked Mr.  Potter, tartly.    \"You don't know it. I'm only advising that precaution.\"    \"And if it don't burst I'll have my pains for my trouble--and no  water for the summer, perhaps. They wouldn't let me have water later,  if I needed it.\"    \"But you're risking your own property here.\"    \"And it's mine to risk, Dr. Davison,\" said Potter, in his sullen way.    \"But there are other people to think of--\"    \"I don't agree with you,\" interrupted the miller. \"I have enough to do  to attend to my own concerns. I don't bother about other people's  business.\"    \"Meaning that I do when I speak to you about the water; eh?\" said the  old doctor, cheerfully. \"Well, I've done my duty. You'll learn some  time, Jabez.\"    He let out the impatient mare then, and the mud spattered from his  wheels as he flew up the road toward Cheslow.      CHAPTER IX     THE CREST OF THE WAVE    The rain could not last forever; Nature must cease weeping some time.  Just as girls, far away from their old homes and their old friends,  must cease wetting their pillows with regretful tears after a time,  and look forward to the new interests and new friends to which they  have come.    Not that Ruth wept much. But the rainy days of that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#7)"],[1," he is very much afraid this young Beecher will  not only be first on the site of the underground city, but that he may  be the first to discover the idol of gold.  It would be a great thing  for a young archaeologist like Beecher to accomplish a mission of this  sort, and beat Professor Bumper in the race.\"    \"Do you think that's why Beecher decided to go on the same steamer we  are to take?\" asked Ned.    \"Yes, I do,\" said Mr. Damon.  \"Though from what Professor Bumper said I  know he regards Professor Beecher as a perfectly honorable man, as well  as a brilliant student.  I do not believe Beecher or his party would  stoop to anything dishonorable or underhand, though they would not  hesitate, nor would we, to take advantage of every fair chance to win  in the race.\"    \"No, I suppose that's right,\" observed Tom; but there was a queer gleam  in his eye, and his chum wondered if Tom did not have in mind the  prospective race between himself and Fenimore Beecher for the regard of  Mary Nestor.  \"We'll do our best to win, and any one is at liberty to  travel on the same steamer we are to take,\" added the young inventor,  and his tone became more incisive.    \"It will be all the livelier with two expeditions after the same golden  idol,\" remarked Ned.    \"Yes, I think we're in for some excitement,\" observed Tom grimly.  But  even he did not realize all that lay before them ere they would reach  Kurzon.    Mr. Damon, having delivered his message, and remarking that his  preparations for leaving were nearly completed, went back to  Waterfield, from there to proceed to New York in a few days with Tom  and Ned, to meet Professor Bumper.    \"Well, I guess we have everything in pretty good shape,\" remarked Tom  to his chum a day or so after the visit of Mr. Damon.  \"Everything is  packed, and as I have a few personal matters to attend to I think I'll  take the afternoon off.\"    \"Go to it!\" laughed Ned, guessing a thing of two.  \"I've got a raft of  stuff myself to look after, but don't let that keep you.\"    \"If there is anything I can do,\" began Tom, \"don't hesitate to----\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Ned.  \"I can do it all alone.  It's some of the  company's business, anyhow, and I'm paid for looking after that.\"    \"All right, then I'll cut along,\" Tom said, and he wore a relieved air.    \"He's going to see Mary,\" observed Ned with a grin, as he observed Tom  hop into his trim little roadster, which under his orders, Koku had  polished and cleaned until it looked as though it had just come from  the factory.    A little later the trim and speedy car drew up in front of the Nestor  home, and Tom bounded up on the front porch, his heart not altogether  as light as his feet.    \"No, I'm sorry, but Mary isn't in,\" said Mrs. Nestor, answering his  inquiry after greeting him.    \"Not at home?\"    \"No, she went on a little visit to her cousin's at Fayetteville.  She  said something about letting you know she was going.\"    \"She did drop me a card,\" answered Tom, and, somehow he did not feel at  all cheerful.  \"But I thought it wasn't until next week she was going.\"    \"That was her plan, Tom.  But she changed it.  Her cousin wired, asking  her to advance the date, and this Mary did.  There was something about  a former school chum who was also to be at Myra's house--Myra is Mary's  cousin you know.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" assented the young inventor.  \"And so Mary is gone.  How  long is she going to stay?\"    \"Oh, about two weeks.  She wasn't quite certain.  It depends on the  kind of a time she has, I suppose.\"    \"Yes, I suppose so,\" agreed Tom.  \"Well, if you write before I do you  might say I called, Mrs. Nestor.\"    \"I will, Tom.  And I know Mary will be sorry she wasn't here to take a  ride with you; it's such a nice day,\" and the lady smiled as she looked  at the speedy roadster.    \"Maybe--maybe you'd like to come for a spin?\" asked Tom, half  desperately.    \"No, thank you.  I'm too old to be jounced around in one of those small  cars.\"    \"Nonsense! She rides as easily as a Pullman sleeper.\"    \"Well, I have to go to a Red Cross meeting, anyhow, so I can't come,  Tom.  Thank you, just the same.\"    Tom did not drive back immediately to his home.  He wanted to do a bit  of thinking, and he believed he could do it best by himself.  So it was  late afternoon when he again greeted Ned, who, meanwhile, had been kept  very busy.    \"Well?\" called Tom's chum.    \"Um!\" was the only answer, and Tom called Koku to put the car away in  the garage.    \"Something wrong,\" mused Ned.    The next three days were crowded with events and with work.  Mr. Damon  came over frequently to consult with Tom and Ned, and finally the last  of their baggage had been packed, certain of Tom's inventions and  implements sent on by express to New York to be taken to Honduras, and  then our friends themselves followed to the metropolis.    \"Good-bye, Tom,\" said his father.  \"Good-bye, and good luck! If you  don't get the idol of gold I'm sure you'll have experiences that will  be valuable to you.\"    \"We're going to get the idol of gold!\" said Tom determinedly.    \"Look out for the bad bugs,\" suggested Eradicate.    \"We will,\" promised Ned.    Tom's last act was to send a message to Mary Nestor, and then he, with  Ned and Mr. Damon, who blessed everything in sight from the gasoline in  the automobile to the blue sky overhead, started for the station.    New York was reached without incident.  The trio put up at the hotel  where Professor Bumper was to meet them.    \"He hasn't arrived yet,\" said Tom, after glancing over the names on the  hotel register and not seeing Professor Bumper's among them.    \"Oh, he'll be here all right,\" asserted Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my galvanic  battery! he sent me a telegram at one o'clock this morning saying he'd  be sure to meet us in New York.  No fear of him not starting for the  land of wonders.\"    \"There are some other professors registered, though,\" observed Ned, as  he glanced at the book, noting the names of several scientists of whom  he and Tom had read.    \"Yes.  I wonder what they're doing in New York,\" replied Tom.  \"They  are from New England.  Maybe there's a convention going on.  Well,  we'll have to wait, that's all, until Professor Bumper comes.\"    And during that wait Tom heard something that surprised him and caused  him no little worry.  It was when Ned came back to his room, which  adjoined Tom's, that the young treasurer gave his chum the news.    \"I say, Tom!\" Ned exclaimed.  \"Who do you think those professors are,  whose names we saw on the register?\"    \"I haven't the least idea.\"    \"Why, they're of Beecher's party!\"    \"You don't mean it!\"    \"I surely do.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"I happened to overhear two of them talking down in the lobby a while  ago.  They didn't make any secret of it.  They spoke freely of going  with Beecher to some ancient city in Honduras, to look for an idol of  gold.\"    \"They did?  But where is Beecher?\"    \"He hasn't joined them yet.  Their plans have been changed.  Instead of  leaving on the same steamer we are to take in the morning they are to  come on a later one.  The professors here are waiting for Beecher to  come.\"    \"Why isn't he here now?\"    \"Well, I heard one of the other scientists say that he had gone to a  place called Fayetteville, and will come on from there.\"    \"Fayetteville!\" ejaculated Tom.    \"Yes.  That isn't far from Shopton.\"    \"I know,\" assented Tom.  \"I wonder--I wonder why he is going there?\"    \"I can tell you that, too.\"    \"You can?  You're a regular detective.\"    \"No, I just happened to overhear it.  Beecher is going to call on Mary  Nestor in Fayetteville, so his friends here said he told them, and his  call has to do with an important matter--to him!\" and Ned gazed  curiously at his chum.          CHAPTER VIII    OFF FOR HONDURAS      Just what Tom's thoughts were, Ned, of course, could not guess.  But by  the flush that showed under the tan of his chum's cheeks the young  financial secretary felt pretty certain that Tom was a bit apprehensive  of the outcome of Professor Beecher's call on Mary Nestor.    \"So he is going to see her about 'something important,' Ned?\"    \"That's what some members of his party called it.\"    \"And they're waiting here for him to join them?\"    \"Yes.  And it means waiting a week for another steamer.  It must be  something pretty important, don't you think, to cause Beecher to risk  that delay in starting after the idol of gold?\"    \"Important?  Yes, I suppose so,\" assented Tom.  \"And yet even if he  waits for the next steamer he will get to Honduras nearly as soon as we  do.\"    \"How is that?\"    \"The next boat is a faster one.\"    \"Then why don't we take that?  I hate dawdling along on a slow  freighter.\"    \"Well, for one thing it would hardly do to change now, when all our  goods are on board.  And besides, the captain of the _Relstab_, on  which we are going to sail, is a friend of Professor Bumper's.\"    \"Well, I'm just as glad Beecher and his party aren't going with us,\"  resumed Ned, after a pause.  \"It might make trouble.\"    \"Oh, I'm ready for any trouble HE might make!\" quickly exclaimed Tom.    He meant trouble that might be developed in going to Honduras, and  starting the search for the lost city and the idol of gold.  This kind  of trouble Tom and his friends had experienced before, on other trips  where rivals had sought to frustrate their ends.    But, in his heart, though he said nothing to Ned about it, Tom was  worried.  Much as he disliked to admit it to himself, he feared the  visit of Professor Beecher to Mary Nestor in Fayetteville had but one  meaning.    \"I wonder if he's going to propose to her,\" thought Tom.  \"He has the  field all to himself now, and her father likes him.  That's in his  favor.  I guess Mr. Nestor has never quite forgiven me for that mistake  about the dynamite box, and that wasn't my fault.  Then, too, the  Beecher and Nestor families have been friends "]]]
