When, however,  the time for voting came, and the Saints voted according to their  convictions of duty, or as their inclinations prompted, the defeated  party or candidates blamed them for the defeat, and straightway favored  the adoption of an anti-Mormon policy, which found support not only in  the defeated party, but also among those who felt a grievance against  the Saints on other accounts; some because Nauvoo's prosperity and  constantly increasing importance as a center of population and trade  and commerce was rapidly eclipsing all other towns of the state; and  others, over-anxious to retard, if not destroy, a rival system on  account of religious prejudice. When an anti-Mormon party took the  field, pledged itself to repeal the Nauvoo charter, and to drive the  Mormons from the state--as was the pledge of Joseph Duncan, Whig  candidate for Governor of Illinois in 1841, [20] there was really no  other course for the Saints to pursue but to combine solidly for the  defeat of the candidate and {XXXIII} party making such pledges; the  instinct of self-preservation impelled such a course, rather than the  prompting of inclination.    For a time, as in all such cases, the party receiving the support of  this practically solid Mormon vote could be relied upon to protect  and defend those who had made success possible for them; but at the  first indication that the hold of the favored party upon such vote is  precarious, that there is a possibility that it might go to the other  side, [21] naturally the ardor of their friendship, seldom or never  sincere, cools; and they are as ready to combine for the destruction  of their former allies as others have been. And when in addition to  precariousness of hold upon those who possess the balance of power  there stands up in the back ground of things the possibility that  the balance of power party may become strong enough in the political  subdivision in which they are located to run affairs on their own  account, the likelihood of all parties combining against them becomes  all the more assured. In Illinois the Latter-day Saints ran the entire  political gamut of experience as a \"balance of power\" factor in the  politics of western Illinois. The final phase of that experience had  been reached when at a mass meeting held at Carthage on the sixth of  September, 1843, it was--        _Resolved,_ That as it has been too common for several years past      for politicians of both political parties, not only of this county,      but likewise of the state, to go to Nauvoo and truckle to the heads      of the Mormon clan for their influence, we pledge ourselves that we      will not support any man of either party in the future who shall      thus debase himself. [22]    Politicians still sought Mormon aid to encompass their own political  ends, but, as Governor Ford later remarked, \"they were willing and  anxious for Mormon voters at elections, but they were unwilling to risk  their popularity with the people, by taking part in their favor even  when law and justice, and the Constitution, were all on their side;\"  [23] and {XXXIV} so finally all parties turned against them, and they  were at the last, as we shall see in the future volume of this history,  expelled without mercy from the state.    _XII. Joseph Smith's Candidacy for the Presidency._    The mischief that threatened during the Prophet's life time, and  which finally befell the Saints, was clearly foreseen by the Church  leaders; and the desire to escape from the threatening portents of it  prompted the nomination of Joseph Smith for the office of President of  the United States, in the general election of 1844. Of course there  could be no hope seriously entertained that he would be elected; but,  as explained by an editorial in the _Times and Seasons,_ [24] if the  Saints could not succeed in electing their candidate, they would have  the satisfaction of knowing that they had acted conscientiously; they  had used their best judgment, under the circumstances, and if they  had to throw away their votes, it was better to do so upon a worthy  than upon an unworthy individual who might use the weapon they put  into his hand to destroy them. The Prophet himself evidently regarded  his nomination humorously rather than seriously, except that it might  result in withdrawing the Saints from the position of shuttle-cock  between the battle doors of the two old political parties. \"I care but  little about the presidential chair,\" he said on one occasion. \"I would  not give half as much for the office of President of the United States  as I would for the one I now hold as Lieutenant General of the Nauvoo  Legion.\" Again he said: \"When I get hold of eastern papers, and see  how popular I am; I am afraid myself that I shall be elected; but if  I should be, I would not say [_i. e._ to the Latter-day Saints] your  cause is just but I can do nothing for you.\"    As a further evidence that Joseph Smith did not regard his candidacy  as likely to be successful, he was, at the time of his nomination and  afterwards, pushing vigorously his project of a western movement for  the Church. He had drawn up a memorial and ordinance to the national  congress asking to be authorized by the general government to raise  one hundred thousand armed volunteers to police the intermountain and  Pacific coast west from Oregon to Texas, for the purpose of assuring  Texas her independence, and maintaining the claims of the United  States to Oregon, and affording the whole western population of our  country protection from Indian depredations; and thus contribute to  the rapid settlement and development of that noble extent of country  lying between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean. His agents, Orson  Hyde and Orson Pratt, presented the matter to senators {XXXV} and  representatives at Washington, and a number favored the project of the  removal of the Mormons to the west, but generally urged that Joseph  Smith go without seeking special authorization from the government.  Reference to Orson Hyde's report of the procedure among congressmen  and their views upon the subject will be found in his two important  communications to the Prophet from Washington, in chapter XVI of this  volume. Mr. John Wentworth, representative to Congress from northern  Illinois, introduced President Smith's Memorial and Ordinance into  the House on the 25th of May, to be read for the information of the  House; but before the reading was concluded, objection was made, and  as it required unanimous consent to have it read, further reading was  prevented. A vote to suspend the rules in order that Mr. Wentworth  might secure the reading of the memorial stood 79 yeas, and 86 nays,  which vote gives evidence at least of a widespread desire to have the  matter presented to the House. [25]    _XIII. Missouri as a Factor in the Affairs of Nauvoo._    In addition to all the Illinois factors that entered into the complex  situation confronting the Saints at Nauvoo, at the time of the  Prophet's death, and some time previous to his arrest, was the attitude  and course pursued by Missouri with reference to Nauvoo and the Saints.  Disgraced as a state by her own conduct towards the Latter-day Saints,  when they were inhabitants within her borders, her people were all too  willing to co-operate with any party or agency that would continue to  make war upon them. If the state of Illinois which with open arms had  received the people that Missouri exiled from her borders, under such  circumstances of cruelty, could also be brought to drive them from that  state, it would be regarded, in a way, as a vindication of Missouri  and the course she had taken in her treatment of the Saints, since in  effect it would say, that the people of Illinois, no less than the  people of Missouri, found it impossible to tolerate the \"Mormons;\"  and therefore there must be something fundamentally wrong with them,  rather than with the people of these states. Hence the anti-Mormons of  Hancock and adjoining counties in Illinois, always found support in  whatever of violence or wrong they planned against the Saints. Hence  the constant threats of invasion of mobs from Missouri, emphasized by  occasional kidnapping expeditions into Hancock county, together with  frequent requisitions upon the Illinois authorities for the arrest and  extradition of Joseph Smith on the old charges against him in Missouri.  And these {XXXVI} Missouri threats and outrages were not among the  least of the annoyances and anxieties of the Saints; and they make  clear the necessity that was felt for an efficient militia force at  Nauvoo. Hence the Nauvoo Legion and the lively interest manifested in  its frequent musters and drills, and its thorough equipment; all of  which, but for the constant danger of invasion from Missouri mobs,  and the co-operation with them of like forces in Illinois, would have  been inconsistent with the deportment of a religious community whose  mission was one of peace and good will towards men; and who had been  especially commanded to \"renounce war and proclaim peace\" (Doc and Cov.  Sec. 98:16); and commanded also to \"sue for peace,\" both to those who  had \"smitten\" them--the revelation was given after the expulsion from  Jackson county, Missouri--and \"to all people;\" and \"lift up an ensign  of peace, and make a proclamation of peace unto the ends of the earth\"  (Doc. and Cov. sec 105: 38-40). But invasions from Missouri constantly  menacing them, and the danger of mob violence breaking out in Illinois,  justified the organization of the Legion, and the maintenance of its  efficiency by full equipment of arms and frequent drills and musters;  for the right of self-preservation is not abrogated by any divine law  given to the Saints; and duty to protect home and family against the  assaults of the evil-disposed, presses as firmly upon the Saints, as  upon those who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6087"],[0,"The Vampyre; a Tale (#7)"],[1,"lishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast;  opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the  monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in  a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him  why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked  as if he did not understand her--then seizing her hands, and gazing  on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear  that she would never wed this monster, for he----  But he could not  advance--it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his  oath--he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him  but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had  heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder,  entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him.  He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to  delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they  imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him,  and retired.    Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had  been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill  health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when  he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure  could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this  information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by  constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the  brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss  Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils  to recount--could speak of himself as of an individual having no  sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he  addressed himself;--could tell how, since he knew her, his existence,  had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he  might listen to her soothing accents;--in fine, he knew so well how to  use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained  her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to  him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for  hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,)  which was to take place the very day before his departure for the  continent.    Aubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted  to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was  given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she  valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now  in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the  hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on  which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they  would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better  not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered,  the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy  inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more  easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation.  Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey  grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame  their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody  of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound  was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment  where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to  perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by  force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the  staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear--\"Remember your oath,  and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women  are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who,  roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no  longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a  blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to  his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was  afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride  and bridegroom left London.    Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms  of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might  be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related  composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.    The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived,  it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had  glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!        ________________________________________________________________                             EXTRACT OF A LETTER,                            CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT                                      OF                            LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE                                    IN THE                             ISLAND OF MITYLENE.    ________________________________________________________________                                   ACCOUNT                                      OF                         LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.                              ______________    \"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and                          Providence his guide.\"    IN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his  Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of  Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and  the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there,  induce many British vessels to visit it--both men of war and  merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships  bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a  voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the  men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle  with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave  called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On  the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and  engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio  with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our  arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek,  \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit  Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very  good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him,  and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the  wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English  currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not  constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different  islands.\"    This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in  hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were  kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It  consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor--an entrance hall, a  drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious  closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained  walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and  a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the  branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus  in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture.  In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty  book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The  bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two  stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow--the common bed throughout Greece.  In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man  told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large  seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think  ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the  recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works  complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German  language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of  the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at  Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at  Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description.  Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a  pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all  over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.    The old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening  before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\"  said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so  particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would  frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once  did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble  of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged  Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord  brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"    The appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in  front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble  pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now  customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the  roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by  a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most  of the house-tops are thus furnished, as"]]]
