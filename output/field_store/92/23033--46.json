The salad was a delicate leaf from some seaweed that Trot  thought was much nicer than lettuce. Several courses were served,  and the lobsters changed the plates with each course, chattering and  scolding as they worked, and as Trot said, \"doing everything  backwards\" in their nervous, fussy way.    Many of the things offered them to eat were unknown to the visitors,  and the child was suspicious of some of them, but Cap'n Bill asked  no questions and ate everything offered him, so Trot decided to  follow his example. Certain it is they found the meal very  satisfying, and evidently there was no danger of their being hungry  while they remained the guests of the mermaids. When the fruits  came, Trot thought that must be the last course of the big dinner,  but following the fruits were ice creams frozen into the shape of  flowers.    \"How funny,\" said the child, \"to be eating ice cream at the bottom  of the sea.\"    \"Why does that surprise you?\" inquired the Queen.    \"I can't see where you get the ice to freeze it,\" Trot replied.    \"It is brought to us from the icebergs that float in the northern  parts of the ocean,\" explained Merla.    \"O' course, Trot. You orter thought o' that. I did,\" said Cap'n  Bill.    The little girl was glad there was no more to eat, for she was  ashamed to feel she had eaten every morsel she could. Her only  excuse for being so greedy was that \"ev'rything tasted just  splendid!\" as she told the queen.    \"And now,\" said Aquareine, \"I will send you out for a swim with  Merla, who will show you some of the curious sights of our sea. You  need not go far this afternoon, and when you return, we will have  another interesting talk together.\" So the blonde mermaid led Trot  and Cap'n Bill outside the palace walls, where they found themselves  in the pretty flower gardens.    \"I'd feel all right, mate, if I could have a smoke,\" remarked the  old sailor to the child, \"but that's a thing as can't be did here in  the water.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Merla, who overheard him.    \"A pipe has to be lighted, an' a match wouldn't burn,\" he replied.    \"Try it,\" suggested the mermaid. \"I do not mind your smoking at all,  if it will give you pleasure.\"    \"It's a bad habit I've got, an' I'm too old to break myself of it,\"  said Cap'n Bill. Then he felt in the big pocket of his coat and took  out a pipe and a bag of tobacco. After he had carefully filled his  pipe, rejoicing in the fact that the tobacco was not at all wet, he  took out his matchbox and struck a light. The match burned brightly,  and soon the sailor was puffing the smoke from his pipe in great  contentment. The smoke ascended through the water in the shape of  bubbles, and Trot wondered what anyone who happened to be floating  upon the surface of the ocean would think to see smoke coming from  the water.    \"Well, I find I can smoke, all right,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"but it  bothers me to understand why.\"    \"It is because of the air space existing between the water and  everything you have about you,\" explained Merla. \"But now, if you  will come this way, I will take you to visit some of our neighbors.\"  They passed over the carpet of sea flowers, the gorgeous blossoms  swaying on their stems as the motion of the people in the water  above them disturbed their repose, and presently the three entered  the dense shrubbery surrounding the palace. They had not proceeded  far when they came to a clearing among the bushes, and here Merla  paused.    Trot and Cap'n Bill paused, too, for floating in the clear water was  a group of beautiful shapes that the child thought looked like molds  of wine jelly. They were round as a dinner plate, soft and  transparent, but tinted in such lovely hues that no artist's brush  has ever been able to imitate them. Some were deep sapphire blue;  others rose pink; still others a delicate topaz color. They seemed  to have neither heads, eyes nor ears, yet it was easy to see they  were alive and able to float in any direction they wished to go. In  shape they resembled inverted flowerpots, with the upper edges  fluted, and from the centers floated what seemed to be bouquets of  flowers.    \"How pretty!\" exclaimed Trot, enraptured by the sight.    \"Yes, this is a rare variety of jellyfish,\" replied Merla. \"The  creatures are not so delicate as they appear, and live for a long  time--unless they get too near the surface and the waves wash them  ashore.\"    After watching the jellyfish a few moments, they followed Merla  through the grove, and soon a low chant, like that of an Indian  song, fell upon their ears. It was a chorus of many small voices and  grew louder as they swam on. Presently a big rock rose suddenly  before them from the bottom of the sea, rearing its steep side far  up into the water overhead, and this rock was thickly covered with  tiny shells that clung fast to its surface. The chorus they heard  appeared to come from these shells, and Merla said to her  companions, \"These are the singing barnacles. They are really very  amusing, and if you listen carefully, you can hear what they say.\"    So Trot and Cap'n Bill listened, and this is what the barnacles  sang:      \"We went to topsy-turvy land to see a man-o'-war,    And we were much attached to it, because we simply were;    We found an anchor-ite within the mud upon the lea    For the ghost of Jonah's whale he ran away and went to sea.    Oh, it was awful!    It was unlawful!    We rallied round the flag in sev'ral millions;    They couldn't shake us;    They had to take us;    So the halibut and cod they danced cotillions.\"    \"What does it all mean?\" asked Trot.    \"I suppose they refer to the way barnacles have of clinging to  ships,\" replied Merla, \"but usually the songs mean nothing at all.  The little barnacles haven't many brains, so we usually find their  songs quite stupid.\"    \"Do they write some comic operas?\" asked the child.    \"I think not,\" answered the mermaid.    \"They seem to like the songs themselves,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.    \"Oh yes, they sing all day long. But it never matters to them  whether their songs mean anything or not. Let us go in this  direction and visit some other sea people.\"    So they swam away from the barnacle-covered rock, and Trot heard the  last chorus as she slowly followed their conductor. The barnacles  were singing:    \"Oh, very well, then, I hear the curfew,  Please go away and come some other day;  Goliath tussels  With Samson's muscles,  Yet the muscles never fight in Oyster Bay.\"    \"It's jus' nonsense!\" said Trot scornfully. \"Why don't they sing  'Annie Laurie' or 'Home, Sweet Home' or else keep quiet?\"    \"Why, if they were quiet,\" replied Merla, \"they wouldn't be singing  barnacles.\"    They now came to one of the avenues which led from the sea garden  out into the broad ocean, and here two swordfishes were standing  guard. \"Is all quiet?\" Merla asked them.    \"Just as usual, your Highness,\" replied one of the guards.  \"Mummercubble was sick this morning and grunted dreadfully, but he's  better now and has gone to sleep. King Anko has been stirring around  some, but is now taking his after-dinner nap. I think it will be  perfectly safe for you to swim out for a while, if you wish.\"    \"Who's Mummercubble?\" asked Trot as they passed out into deep water.    \"He's the sea pig,\" replied Merla. \"I am glad he's asleep, for now  we won't meet him.\"    \"Don't you like him?\" inquired Trot.    \"Oh, he complains so bitterly of everything that he bores us,\" Merla  answered. \"Mummercubble is never contented or happy for a single  minute.\"    \"I've seen people like that,\" said Cap'n Bill with a nod of his  head. \"An' they has a way of upsettin' the happiest folks they  meet.\"    \"Look out!\" suddenly cried the mermaid. \"Look out for your fingers!  Here are the snapping eels.\"    \"Who? Where?\" asked Trot anxiously.    And now they were in the midst of a cluster of wriggling, darting  eels which sported all around them in the water with marvelous  activity. \"Yes, look out for your fingers and your noses!\" said one  of the eels, making a dash for Cap'n Bill. At first the sailor was  tempted to put out a hand and push the creature away, but  remembering that his fingers would thus be exposed, he remained  quiet, and the eel snapped harmlessly just before his face and then  darted away.    \"Stop it!\" said Merla. \"Stop it this minute, or I'll report your  impudence to Aquareine.\"    \"Oh, who cares?\" shouted the Eels. \"We're not afraid of the  mermaids.\"    \"She'll stiffen you up again, as she did once before,\" said Merla,  \"if you try to hurt the earth people.\"    \"Are these earth people?\" asked one. And then they all stopped their  play and regarded Trot and Cap'n Bill with their little black eyes.    \"The old polliwog looks something like King Anko,\" said one of them.    \"I'm not a polliwog!\" answered Cap'n Bill angrily. \"I'm a respec'ble  sailor man, an' I'll have you treat me decent or I'll know why.\"    \"Sailor!\" said another. \"That means to float on the water--not IN  it. What are you doing down here?\"    \"I'm jes' a-visitin',\" answered Cap'n Bill.    \"He is the guest of our queen,\" said Merla, \"and so is this little  girl. If you do not behave nicely to them, you will surely be  sorry.\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" replied one of the biggest eels, wriggling  around in a circle and then snapping at a companion, which as  quickly snapped out of his way. \"We know how to be polite to company  as well as the mermaids. We won't hurt them.\"    \"Come on, fellows, let's go scare old Mummercubble,\" cried another;  and then in a flash they all darted away and left our friends to  themselves. Trot was greatly relieved.    \"I don't like eels,\" she said.    \"They are more mischievous than harmful,\" replied Merla, \"but I do  not care much for them myself.\"    \"No,\" added Cap'n Bill, \"they ain't respec'ful.\"          CHAPTER 7    THE ARISTOCRATIC"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#7)"],[1,"s, taking from him the electric tube and the silver box  containing his tablets.  These they carried to the cabin and threw upon  the heap of other valuables they had stolen.  They did not notice his  traveling machine, however, but seeing him now unarmed they began  jeering and laughing at him, while the brutal captain relieved his  anger by giving the prisoner several malicious kicks.    Rob bore his misfortune meekly, although he was almost ready to cry  with grief and disappointment.  But when one of the pirates, to inflict  further punishment on the boy, came towards him with a heavy strap, he  resolved not to await the blow.    Turning the indicator to the word \"up\" he found, to his joy and relief,  that it would yet obey the influence of the power of repulsion.  Seeing  him rise into the air the fellow made a grab for his foot and held it  firmly, while his companions ran to help him.  Weight seemed to make no  difference in the machine; it lifted the pirate as well as Rob; it  lifted another who clung to the first man's leg, and another who clung  to him.  The other two also caught hold, hoping their united strength  would pull him down, and the next minute Rob was soaring through the  air with the entire string of five buccaneers dangling from his left  leg.    At first the villains were too astounded to speak, but as they realized  that they were being carried through the air and away from their ship  they broke into loud shouts of dismay, and finally the one who grasped  Rob's leg lost his hold and the five plunged downward and splashed into  the sea.    Finding the machine disposed to work accurately, Rob left the  buccaneers to swim to the ship in the best way they could, while he  dropped down to the deck again and recovered from the cabin his box of  tablets and the electric tube.  The fellows were just scrambling on  board when he again escaped, shooting into the air with considerable  speed.    Indeed, the instrument now worked better than at any time since he had  reached the cannibal island, and the boy was greatly delighted.    The wind at first sent him spinning away to the south, but he continued  to rise until he was above the air currents, and the storm raged far  beneath him.  Then he set the indicator to the northwest and  breathlessly waited to see if it would obey.  Hurrah! away he sped at a  fair rate of speed, while all his anxiety changed to a feeling of sweet  contentment.    His success had greatly surprised him, but he concluded that the jar  caused by dropping the instrument had relieved the pressure upon the  works, and so helped rather than harmed the free action of the electric  currents.    While he moved through the air with an easy, gliding motion he watched  with much interest the storm raging below.  Above his head the sun was  peacefully shining and the contrast was strange and impressive.  After  an hour or so the storm abated, or else he passed away from it, for the  deep blue of the ocean again greeted his eyes.  He dropped downward  until he was about a hundred feet above the water, when he continued  his northwesterly course.    But now he regretted having interfered for a moment with the action of  the machine, for his progress, instead of being swift as a bird's  flight, became slow and jerky, nor was he sure that the damaged machine  might not break down altogether at any moment.  Yet so far his progress  was in the right direction, and he resolved to experiment no further  with the instrument, but to let it go as it would, so long as it  supported him above the water.  However irregular the motion might be,  it was sure, if continued, to bring him to land in time, and that was  all he cared about just then.    When night fell his slumber was broken and uneasy, for he wakened more  than once with a start of fear that the machine had broken and he was  falling into the sea.  Sometimes he was carried along at a swift pace,  and again the machine scarcely worked at all; so his anxiety was  excusable.    The following day was one of continued uneasiness for the boy, who  began to be harrassed by doubts as to whether, after all, he was moving  in the right direction.  The machine had failed at one time in this  respect and it might again.  He had lost all confidence in its accuracy.    In spite of these perplexities Rob passed the second night of his  uneven flight in profound slumber, being exhausted by the strain and  excitement he had undergone.  When he awoke at daybreak, he saw, to his  profound delight, that he was approaching land.    The rising sun found him passing over a big city, which he knew to be  Boston.    He did not stop.  The machine was so little to be depended upon that he  dared make no halt.  But he was obliged to alter the direction from  northwest to west, and the result of this slight change was so great a  reduction in speed that it was mid-day before he saw beneath him the  familiar village in which he lived.    Carefully marking the location of his father's house, he came to a stop  directly over it, and a few moments later he managed to land upon the  exact spot in the back yard whence he had taken his first successful  flight.          7.  The Demon Becomes Angry      When Rob had been hugged and kissed by his mother and sisters, and even  Mr. Joslyn had embraced him warmly, he gave them a brief account of his  adventures.  The story was received with many doubtful looks and much  grave shaking of heads, as was quite natural under the circumstances.    \"I hope, my dear son,\" said the father, \"that you have now passed  through enough dangers to last you a lifetime, so that hereafter you  will be contented to remain at home.\"    \"Oh, Robert!\" cried his mother, with tears in her loving eyes, \"you  don't know how we've all worried about you for the past week!\"    \"A week?\" asked Rob, with surprise.    \"Yes; it's a week to-morrow morning since you flew into the air and  disappeared.\"    \"Then,\" said the boy, thoughtfully, \"I've reached home just in time.\"    \"In time for what?\" she asked.    But he did not answer that question.  He was thinking of the Demon, and  that on the afternoon of this very day he might expect the wise and  splendid genius to visit him a second time.    At luncheon, although he did not feel hungry, he joined the family at  the table and pleased his mother by eating as heartily as of old.  He  was surprised to find how good the food tasted, and to realize what a  pleasure it is to gratify one's sense of taste.  The tablets were all  right for a journey, he thought, but if he always ate them he would be  sure to miss a great deal of enjoyment, since there was no taste to  them at all.    At four o'clock he went to his workshop and unlocked the door.  Everything was exactly as he had left it, and he looked at his simple  electrical devices with some amusement.  They seemed tame beside the  wonders now in his possession; yet he recollected that his numerous  wires had enabled him to strike the Master Key, and therefore should  not be despised.    Before long he noticed a quickening in the air, as if it were suddenly  surcharged with electric fluid, and the next instant, in a dazzling  flash of light, appeared the Demon.    \"I am here!\" he announced.    \"So am I,\" answered Rob.  \"But at one time I really thought I should  never see you again.  I've been--\"    \"Spare me your history,\" said the Demon, coldly.  \"I am aware of your  adventures.\"    \"Oh, you are!\" said Rob, amazed.  \"Then you know--\"    \"I know all about your foolish experiences,\" interrupted the Demon,  \"for I have been with you constantly, although I remained invisible.\"    \"Then you know what a jolly time I've had,\" returned the boy.  \"But why  do you call them foolish experiences?\"    \"Because they were, abominably foolish!\" retorted the Demon, bitterly.  \"I entrusted to you gifts of rare scientific interest--electrical  devices of such utility that their general adoption by mankind would  create a new era in earth life.  I hoped your use of these devices  would convey such hints to electrical engineers that they would quickly  comprehend their mechanism and be able to reproduce them in sufficient  quantities to supply the world.  And how do you treat these marvelous  gifts?  Why, you carry them to a cannibal island, where even your crude  civilization has not yet penetrated!\"    \"I wanted to astonish the natives,\" said Rob, grinning.    The Demon uttered an exclamation of anger, and stamped his foot so  fiercely that thousands of electric sparks filled the air, to disappear  quickly with a hissing, crinkling sound.    \"You might have astonished those ignorant natives as easily by showing  them an ordinary electric light,\" he cried, mockingly.  \"The power of  your gifts would have startled the most advanced electricians of the  world.  Why did you waste them upon barbarians?\"    \"Really,\" faltered Rob, who was frightened and awed by the Demon's  vehement anger, \"I never intended to visit a cannibal island.  I meant  to go to Cuba.\"    \"Cuba!  Is that a center of advanced scientific thought?  Why did you  not take your marvels to New York or Chicago; or, if you wished to  cross the ocean, to Paris or Vienna?\"    \"I never thought of those places,\" acknowledged Rob, meekly.    \"Then you were foolish, as I said,\" declared the Demon, in a calmer  tone.  \"Can you not realize that it is better to be considered great by  the intelligent thinkers of the earth, than to be taken for a god by  stupid cannibals?\"    \"Oh, yes, of course,\" said Rob.  \"I wish now that I had gone to Europe.  But you're not the only one who has a kick coming,\" he continued.  \"Your flimsy traveling machine was nearly the death of me.\"    \"Ah, it is true,\" acknowledged the Demon, frankly.  \"The case was made  of too light material.  When the rim was bent it pressed against the  works and impeded the proper action of the currents.  Had you gone to a  civilized country such an accident could "]]]
