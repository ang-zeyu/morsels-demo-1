As for the calamitous events of the Church during the Kirtland  period, what shall we say of them? Are they to be accounted wholly  deplorable, or as part of that experience of the Church which makes  for advancement? Unquestionably every experience is of value to an  individual or an organization. Some experiences may be sad, and  accounted at the time as disastrous; but are they really so? The rough  wind which shakes it helps the young and slow-growing oak; for by  reason of this very shaking the tree takes firmer hold of the earth;  wider spread the roots; deeper down into the soil are they thrust,  until the sapling, once so easily shaken, becomes a monarch in the  forest, mocks the howling tempest, until its height and frame become  worthy of the land and atmosphere in which it grows a giant tree.  So may grow a government--civil or ecclesiastical--so may grow the  Church, helped by the adverse circumstances which shake it to the very  foundations on which it rests. Profitable if not sweet are the uses of  adversity. As the winter's wind when it bites and blows upon man's body  is no flatterer, but feelingly persuades him what he is, so the adverse  circumstances which overtake an organization, such as the Church of  Christ, may be very profitable to it. Such rebellions and apostasies  as occurred in this Kirtland period of the Church's history but test  and exhibit the strength of the fabric. Such circumstances force a  review of the work as far as accomplished. The whole is re-examined to  see if in it there is any flaw or defect; if any worthless material  is being worked into its structure. Hence periods usually considered  calamitous are accompanied by corrections of what may be wrong;  and the body religious is purified by the expulsion of those whose  rebellion and apostasy but prove them unworthy of the Lord's work.  Let me be rightly understood here. I am not contending that adverse  circumstances, rebellions and apostasies are in themselves good.  Whatever may be the over-ruled results to the body religious, rebellion  and apostasy spell condemnation and the destruction of spiritual life  for the individuals overtaken by such calamities. But so long as human  nature is what it now is--weak and sinful--just so long as out of that  intractable material the Church of Christ has the mission to prepare  men for the Father's kingdom, just so long will there be occasional  calamities periods in the history of the Church such as was the year  1837 at Kirtland. But what after all are such periods but times of  purification, of cleansing? During the previous years of success in the  ministry, there had been gathered into the Church all classes of men.  As in former dispensations of the Gospel, so in this last dispensation;  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net cast into the sea, that  gathers of every kind of fish; and when it is full, they draw it to  shore, and sit down, and gather the good into vessels, and cast  the bad away. The first step in the process of correcting human nature  is to discover its defects. It may not always follow that when the  defects are made known they will be corrected. But it is true that no  correction will be made until the necessity of correction is manifest,  until the defects are pointed out. Hence God has said: \"If men will  come unto me, I will show unto them their weaknesses.\" But, unhappily,  it sometimes is the case that men resist God, they love their sins,  they become hardened in their iniquity, they resist the Spirit, and  prove themselves unworthy of the Father's kingdom. What then? Shall  they pollute that kingdom, or shall they be cast out as material  unfitted for the Master's use, and of their own volition choose to  remain so? There can be but one reasonable answer to the question. They  refuse to go peaceably, however. They are boisterous, they accuse the  innocent, they justify their own course, they seek to wreck the Church,  to bring to pass chaos; and in the midst of this disorder they are cast  out; and although this may not always end their power to work mischief,  or create annoyance for the body--religious--for the power to work evil  is still with them--yet the Church is rid of them, and in no way can  be regarded as responsible for their wickedness. It is our custom to  enumerate such scenes as among the calamitous events of the Church; and  they are so, in some aspects of the case. As already remarked it is a  calamitous time for those who are cast out, for they are overcome of  the evil one; and as the heavens wept when the Son of the Morning and  his following were cast out of heaven, so it is to be expected that  the Saints will be sad, and sorrow over those who are overcome of the  adversary. But for the Church herself it is well that this intractable  material is gotten rid of; that the body religious is purged of those  who can only be a source of weakness and of shame to her. She is helped  by the event; purified by it; strengthened; made more acceptable with  God and pleasing to reasonable men. It is only in a modified sense,  then, that this latter part of the Kirtland period of the Church's  history can be regarded as a calamitous time. There is more adversity  yet to follow in the experience of the Saints; much distress and many  sore trials; and so shall there continue to be such times of trial as  long as the Church remains the Church militant. Not until she becomes  the Church triumphant, and is glorified by the presence of her Great  Head, the Lord Jesus Christ, can the Saints hope for an absolute  discontinuance of the occasional recurrence of what are generally  considered trying or calamitous events.

[Sidenote: Condition of the Saints in Missouri.]    _January 1, 1834_.--The scattered Saints in Missouri commenced the year  eighteen hundred and thirty-four, with a conference, which they held  in Clay county, on the first day of January, at which Bishop Partridge  presided. After transacting much business relative to comforting and  strengthening the scattered members of the Church, it was        _Resolved_, That Lyman Wight and Parley P. Pratt be sent as special      messengers, to represent the situation of the scattered brethren in      Missouri, to the Presidency and Church in Kirtland, and ask their      advice.    {2} [Sidenote: Excommunication of Wesley Hurlburt.]    On the evening of the 2nd of January, a Bishop's court assembled in  Kirtland to investigate the case of Wesley Hurlburt, against whom  charges had been preferred by Harriet Howe and others to the effect  \"that Hurlburt had denied the faith, spoken reproachfully of the  Church, did not believe Joseph was a true Prophet,\" etc. Hurlburt was  in the place, but did not appear before the court, consequently was cut  off.    [Sidenote: Mob Threats at Kirtland.]    The threats of the mob about Kirtland through the fall and winter had  been such as to cause the brethren to be constantly on the lookout,  and those who labored on the temple were engaged at night watching  to protect the walls they had laid during the day, from threatened  violence. On the morning of the 8th of January, about 1 o'clock, the  inhabitants of Kirtland were alarmed by the firing of about thirteen  rounds of cannon, by the mob, on the hill about half a mile northwest  of the village. [1]    [Sidenote: A Prayer.]    On the evening of the 11th of January, Joseph Smith, Jun., Frederick  G. Williams, Newel K. Whitney, John Johnson, Oliver Cowdery, and Orson  Hyde united in prayer, and asked the Lord to grant the following  petitions:    1.--That the Lord would grant that our lives might be precious in His  sight; that He would watch over our persons, and give His angels charge  concerning us and our families, that no evil nor unseen hand might be  permitted to harm us.    2.--That the Lord would also hold the lives of all the United Order as  sacred, and not suffer that any of them should be taken.    {3} 3.--That the Lord would grant that Brother Joseph might prevail  over his enemy, even Dr. Hurlburt, who has threatened his life, whom  Joseph has caused to be taken with a precept; that the Lord would fill  the heart of the court with a spirit to do justice, and cause that the  law of the land may be magnified in bringing Hurlburt to justice.    4.--That the Lord in the order of His providence, would provide the  Bishop of this Church [at Kirtland] with means sufficient to discharge  every debt, in due season, that the Order owes, that the Church may not  be brought into disrepute, and the Saints be afflicted by the hands of  their enemies.    5.--That the Lord would protect our printing press from the hands  of evil men, and give us means to send forth His record, even His  Gospel, that the ears of all may hear it; and also that we may print  His Scriptures; and also that He would give those who were appointed  to conduct the press, wisdom sufficient that the cause may not be  hindered, but that men's eyes may thereby be opened to see the truth, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#7)"],[1,"t.    16. But let us examine a little the received opinion.--It is said  EXTENSION is a MODE or accident OF MATTER, and that Matter is the  SUBSTRATUM that supports it. Now I desire that you would explain to me  what is meant by Matter's SUPPORTING extension. Say you, I have no idea  of Matter and therefore cannot explain it. I answer, though you have no  positive, yet, if you have any meaning at all, you must at least have a  relative idea of Matter; though you know not what it is, yet you must be  supposed to know what relation it bears to accidents, and what is meant  by its supporting them. It is evident SUPPORT cannot here be taken in  its usual or literal sense--as when we say that pillars support a  building; in what sense therefore must it be taken? [Note.]    [Note: \"For my part, I am not able to discover any sense at all that can  be applicable to it.\"--Edit 1710.]    17. PHILOSOPHICAL MEANING OF \"MATERIAL SUBSTANCE\" DIVISIBLE INTO TWO  PARTS.--If we inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare  themselves to mean by MATERIAL SUBSTANCE, we shall find them acknowledge  they have no other meaning annexed to those sounds but the idea of BEING  IN GENERAL, together WITH THE RELATIVE NOTION OF ITS SUPPORTING  ACCIDENTS. The general idea of Being appeareth to me the most abstract  and incomprehensible of all other; and as for its supporting accidents,  this, as we have just now observed, cannot be understood in the common  sense of those words; it must therefore be taken in some other sense, but  what that is they do not explain. So that when I consider the TWO PARTS  or branches which make the signification of the words MATERIAL SUBSTANCE,  I am convinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them. But why  should we trouble ourselves any farther, in discussing this material  SUBSTRATUM or support of figure and motion, and other sensible qualities?  Does it not suppose they have an existence without the mind? And is not  this a direct repugnancy, and altogether inconceivable?    18. THE EXISTENCE OF EXTERNAL BODIES WANTS PROOF.--But, though it  were possible that solid, figured, movable substances may exist  without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies,  yet HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO KNOW THIS? Either we must know it by  sense or by reason. As for our senses, by them we have the knowledge ONLY  OF OUR SENSATIONS, ideas, or those things that are immediately perceived  by sense, call them what you will: but they do not inform us that things  exist without the mind, or unperceived, like to those which are  perceived. This the materialists themselves acknowledge. It remains  therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things, it  must be by REASON, inferring their existence from what is immediately  perceived by sense. But what reason can induce us to believe the  existence of bodies without the mind, from what we perceive, since the  very patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend there is ANY NECESSARY  CONNEXION BETWIXT THEM AND OUR IDEAS? I say it is granted on all hands  (and what happens in dreams, phrensies, and the like, puts it beyond  dispute) that IT IS POSSIBLE WE MIGHT BE AFFECTED WITH ALL THE IDEAS WE  HAVE NOW, THOUGH THERE WERE NO BODIES EXISTING WITHOUT RESEMBLING THEM.  Hence, it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary  for the producing our ideas; since it is granted they are produced  sometimes, and might possibly be produced always in the same order, we  see them in at present, without their concurrence.    19.  THE EXISTENCE OF EXTERNAL BODIES AFFORDS NO EXPLICATION OF THE  MANNER IN WHICH OUR IDEAS ARE PRODUCED.--But, though we might possibly  have all our sensations without them, yet perhaps it may be thought  EASIER to conceive and explain the MANNER of their production,  by supposing external bodies in their likeness rather than otherwise;  and so it might be at least probable there are such things as bodies  that excite their ideas in our minds. But neither can this be said;  for, though we give the materialists their external bodies, they  by their own confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas  are produced; since they own themselves unable to comprehend in  what manner BODY CAN ACT UPON SPIRIT, or how it is possible it should  imprint any idea in the mind. Hence it is evident the production of ideas  or sensations in our minds can be no reason why we should suppose Matter  or corporeal substances, SINCE THAT IS ACKNOWLEDGED TO REMAIN EQUALLY  INEXPLICABLE WITH OR WITHOUT THIS SUPPOSITION. If therefore it were  possible for bodies to exist without the mind, yet to hold they do so,  must needs be a very precarious opinion; since it is to suppose, without  any reason at all, that God has created innumerable beings THAT ARE  ENTIRELY USELESS, AND SERVE TO NO MANNER OF PURPOSE.    20. DILEMMA.--In short, if there were external bodies, it is impossible we  should ever come to know it; and if there were not, we might have the very  same reasons to think there were that we have now. Suppose--what no one  can deny possible--an intelligence without the help of external bodies, to  be affected with the same train of sensations or ideas that you are,  imprinted in the same order and with like vividness in his mind. I ask  whether that intelligence has not all the reason to believe the  existence of corporeal substances, represented by his ideas, and exciting  them in his mind, that you can possibly have for believing the same  thing? Of this there can be no question--which one consideration were  enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever  arguments be may think himself to have, for the existence of bodies  without the mind.    21. Were it necessary to add any FURTHER PROOF AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF  MATTER after what has been said, I could instance several of those errors  and difficulties (not to mention impieties) which have sprung from that  tenet. It has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in  philosophy, and not a few of far greater moment in religion. But I shall  not enter into the detail of them in this place, as well because I think  arguments A POSTERIORI are unnecessary for confirming what has been, if I  mistake not, sufficiently demonstrated A PRIORI, as because I shall  hereafter find occasion to speak somewhat of them.    22. I am afraid I have given cause to think I am needlessly prolix in  handling this subject. For, to what purpose is it to dilate on that which  may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two, to any one  that is capable of the least reflexion? It is but looking into your own  thoughts, and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound,  or figure, or motion, or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived.  This easy trial may perhaps make you see that what you contend for is a  downright contradiction. Insomuch that I am content to put the whole upon  this issue:--If you can but CONCEIVE it possible for one extended movable  substance, or, in general, for any one idea, or anything like an idea, to  exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up the  cause. And, as for all that COMPAGES of external bodies you contend for,  I shall grant you its existence, THOUGH (1.) YOU CANNOT EITHER GIVE ME ANY  REASON WHY YOU BELIEVE IT EXISTS [Vide sect. lviii.], OR (2.) ASSIGN ANY  USE TO IT WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO EXIST [Vide sect. lx.]. I say, the bare  possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that  it is so. [Note: i.e. although your argument be deficient in the two  requisites of an hypothesis.--Ed.]    23. But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine  trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet, and nobody  by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it;  but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind  certain ideas which you call BOOKS and TREES, and the same time omitting  to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? BUT DO NOT YOU  YOURSELF PERCEIVE OR THINK OF THEM ALL THE WHILE? This therefore is  nothing to the purpose; it only shows you have the power of imagining or  forming ideas in your mind: but it does not show that you can conceive it  possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind. To make  out this, IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU CONCEIVE THEM EXISTING UNCONCEIVED OR  UNTHOUGHT OF, WHICH IS A MANIFEST REPUGNANCY. When we do our utmost to  conceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only  contemplating our own ideas. But the mind taking no notice of itself, is  deluded to think it can and does conceive bodies existing unthought of or  without the mind, though at the same time they are apprehended by or  exist in itself. A little attention will discover to any one the truth  and evidence of what is here said, and make it unnecessary to insist on  any other proofs against the existence of material substance.    24. THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF UNTHINKING THINGS ARE WORDS WITHOUT  A MEANING.--It is very obvious, upon the least inquiry into our thoughts,  to know whether it is possible for us to understand what is meant by the  ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF SENSIBLE OBJECTS IN THEMSELVES, OR WITHOUT THE MIND.  To me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction, or  else nothing at all. And to convince others of this, I know no readier or  fairer way than to entreat they would calmly attend to their own  thoughts; and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those  expressions does appear, surely nothing more is requisite for the  conviction. It is on this therefore that I insist, to wit, that the  ABSOLUTE existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or  which include a contradiction. This is what I repeat and inculcate, and  earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader.    25."]]]
