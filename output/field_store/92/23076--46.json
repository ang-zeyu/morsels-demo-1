CHAPTER II.    THE WITNESS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE    One thing with reference to modern discoveries of confirmatory  evidences of the Bible is singular. That one thing is the fact that all  these modern discoveries of evidences are confined to the eastern half  of the world, to Asia and Africa. Can it be that God left no witnesses  for himself in the western half of the world? Did he ignore and leave  to perish without spiritual enlightenment, or knowledge of any means  of salvation, all those tribes of men, those nations and empires, that  inhabited the western hemisphere through so many ages? It should be  remembered while considering these questions that the scriptures teach  that        God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on      all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before      appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should      seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him,      though he be not far from every one of us: for in him we live, and      move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have      said, For we are also his offspring. [1]    From this it appears that all races of men have a common origin.  They are all made \"of one blood,\" and have one common Father--God.  Yet if one judge the spirit of orthodox believers in the Bible, he  would conclude that this Father's anxiety had all been expended in  the enlightenment of those races and nations inhabiting the eastern  hemisphere. That he had made ample provision for their instruction  in the ways of God, and revealed to them, through his Son, the means  of their salvation; but left the untold millions of his children in  the western hemisphere to perish in ignorance. No prophets instructed  them; no Son of God came to announce to them the means of salvation,  or proclaim by his own resurrection the reality of the future life and  immortality of man. And hence no one has unearthed the half-buried  cities, or examined the ruined temples, or the fallen palaces--the  extent and greatness of which proclaim the grandeur of ancient  America's civilization--for confirmatory evidence of the Bible.  The inscriptions upon their temple walls and monuments have not  been deciphered for that purpose, nor their history and traditions  investigated with that end in view, except in a few instances where  men have been imbued with the idea that the aborigines of America  might be the descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel. These, with  a few others prompted by a desire to solve the mystery of America's  ancient civilization, have explored the ruined cities, described the  crumbling pyramids and temples, and remains of splendid aqueducts.  They have collected and detailed their mythologies, traditions, and  history; some circumstances of which bear strong evidence to the  fact that the ancient inhabitants of the western hemisphere, in some  way, had been made acquainted with some of the chief events of Bible  history, including some knowledge of the atonement and other doctrines  of Messiah. But such evidences of these facts as have been collected  are not received into the collection of modern evidences for the truth  of the Bible. I do not know of a single book in which they are so  received. From the profound silence enforced upon American monuments  and inscriptions, one would be left to suppose that they are as silent  in testimony for the revealed truth of God as the birds of the South  continent, however resplendent in gaudy plumage, are silent as to song.  It is just here, however, where the importance of the Book of Mormon is  best exhibited. It is here where it can be proclaimed as the voice of  the western hemisphere proclaiming the sublime truth that God did not  leave himself without witness among the races and nations of men that  inhabited the western world. It is here that its importance is felt as  the voice of sleeping nations speaking as out of the dust to the whole  world, not only vindicating the quality of justice in God, in that  he did not leave the inhabitants of the western hemisphere to perish  in ignorance of himself and the plan of life and salvation which had  been ordained for the redemption of mankind; but also in that it bears  witness to the world that the collection of books known as the Bible is  the word of God, authentic, credible, and binding upon the consciences  of men. It is a Witness for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and of the truth  of the Bible, which in value far surpasses all the evidences discovered  in Egypt, the valley of the Euphrates, the Sinaitic Peninsula, and  the land of Palestine throughout the nineteenth century. Let us here  consider it.    First in chronological order, if not in importance, is the book of  Ether, within the Book of Mormon. This book of Ether is an abridgment  of a very ancient American record that was engraven upon twenty-four  gold plates, by a prophet named Ether, hence the name of the book. He  wrote his record most likely in the early part of the sixth century B.  C. The plates were discovered by a branch of the Nephite nation about  120 years B. C., and were preserved by the Nephites with other sacred  records, which finally were placed in the keeping of a prophet named  Moroni, about the close of the fourth century A. D. This Moroni is  the one who translated the record engraven upon the plates of Ether,  an abridgment of which he placed with the Book of Mormon. The book  of Ether contained an account of the most ancient events from the  creation of Adam to the confusion of languages; but as Moroni supposed  the information of this part of the book of Ether would be in the  possession of the Jews, he did not transcribe that part of it, but  began his abridgment from the confounding of the languages at Babel.  The book of Ether speaks of one Jared and his brother, the latter a  most remarkable prophet, living at Babel previous to the confusion of  languages, and to whom the Lord revealed his intention of confounding  the language of the people. At the solicitation of Jared, to whom  he had imparted the knowledge of the coming calamity, this prophet  besought the Lord that the language of Jared, himself, and their  families might not be confounded, and the Lord had respect unto his  prayer and confounded not their language; but directed the formation  of a colony consisting of Jared, his brother, and their families and  friends which the Lord led forth from Babylon and finally brought to  the north continent of the western hemisphere. The colony grew into a  great nation, occupying at least the greater part of North America, and  were known to the Nephites as the people of Jared.    The book of Ether confirms the special particulars of the Bible  concerning there being in existence a record of the creation; the  existence of Adam; the erection of the tower of Babel; the confounding  of languages; and the scattering of the people into all the lands of  the earth.    Second: Six hundred years before Christ, a prophet of the Lord named  Lehi, being warned of the destruction of Jerusalem, departed with his  family into the wilderness, traveling southward from the Holy City  until he reached the borders of the Red Sea; and while camped on its  shores he received direction from the Lord that his sons should return  to Jerusalem and obtain a certain record in the hands of one Laban,  containing a record of the Jews and also the genealogy of Lehi's  forefathers engraven upon plates of brass. Agreeable to the heavenly  commandment the sons returned, and after overcoming some difficulties  finally succeeded in securing the records and returning with them  to the encampment of Lehi. Finally, when Lehi's colony embarked for  America, they brought those records with them. These records are thus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#7)"],[1,"seq.), but  afterwards is of quite general occurrence among the Hebrews.  At  Shechem and Gibeon the transition takes place almost in the full  light of history; some other old-Israelite places of worship,  certain of which are afterwards represented as Levitical towns,  betray their origin by their names at least, e.g., Bethshemesh or  Ir Heres (Sun-town), and Ashtaroth Karnaim (the two-horned  Astarte).  In the popular recollection, also, the memory of the  fact that many of the most prominent sacrificial seats were  already in existence at the date of the immigration continues to  survive.  Shechem, Bethel, Beersheba, figure in Genesis as  instituted by the patriarchs; other equally important holy  sites, not so.  The reason for the distinction can only lie in a  consciousness of the more recent origin of the latter; those of  the one class had been found by the people when they came, those  of the other category they had themselves established.   For of  course, if the Hebrews did not hesitate to appropriate to  themselves the old holy places of the country, neither did they  feel any difficulty in instituting new ones.  In Gilgal and  Shiloh, in the fixed camps where, in the first instance, they had  found a permanent foothold in Palestine proper, there forthwith  arose important centres of worship; so likewise in other places of  political importance, even in such as only temporarily come into  prominence, as Ophrah, Ramah, and Nob near Gibeah.  And, apart from  the greater cities with their more or less regular religious  service, it is perfectly permissible to erect an altar extempore,  and offer sacrifice wherever an occasion presents itself.  When,  after the battle of Michmash, the people, tired and hungry, fell  upon the cattle they had taken, and began to devour the flesh with  the blood (that is, without pouring out the blood on the altar),  Saul caused a great stone to be erected, and ordered that every  man should slaughter his ox or his sheep there.  This was the  first altar which Saul erected to Jehovah, adds the narrator,  certainly not as a reproach, nor even to signalise his conduct as  anything surprising or exceptional.  The instance is all the more  instructive, because it shows how the prohibition to eat flesh  without rendering the blood back to God at a time when the people  did not live crowded together within a quite limited area  necessarily presupposed liberty to sacrifice anywhere--or to  slaughter anywhere; for originally the two words are absolutely  synonymous.    It need not be said that the sacrificial seats (even when the  improvised ones are left out of account) were not all alike in the  regard in which they were held, or in the frequency with which  they were resorted to.  Besides purely local ones, there were  others to which pilgrimages were made from far and near.  Towards  the close of the period of the judges, Shiloh appears to have  acquired an importance that perhaps extended even beyond the limits  of the tribe of Joseph.  By a later age the temple there was even  regarded as the prototype of the temple of Solomon, that is, as the  one legitimate place of worship to which Jehovah had made a grant  of all the burnt-offerings of the children of Israel (Jer. vii.12;  1Samuel ii. 27-36).  But, in point-of fact, if a prosperous man of  Ephraim or Benjamin made a pilgrimage to the joyful festival at  Shiloh at the turn of the year, the reason for his doing so was not  that he could have had no opportunity at his home in Ramah or  Gibeah for eating and drinking before the Lord.  Any strict  centralisation is for that period inconceivable, alike in the  religious as in every other sphere.  This is seen even in the  circumstance that the destruction of the temple of Shiloh, the  priesthood of which we find officiating at Nob a little later, did  not exercise the smallest modifying influence upon the character  and position of the cultus; Shiloh disappears quietly from the  scene, and is not mentioned again until we learn from Jeremiah that  at least from the time when Solomon's temple was founded its temple  lay in ruins.    For the period during which the temple of Jerusalem was not yet in  existence, even the latest redaction of the historical books (which  perhaps does not everywhere proceed from the same hand, but all  dates from the same period--that of the Babylonian exile--and has  its origin in the same spirit) leaves untouched the multiplicity  of altars and of holy places.  No king after Solomon is left  uncensured for having tolerated the high places, but Samuel is  permitted in his proper person to preside over a sacrificial feast  at the Bamah of his native town, and Solomon at the beginning of  his reign to institute a similar one at the great Bamah of Gibeon,  without being blamed.  The offensive name is again and again  employed in the most innocent manner in 1Samuel ix., x., and the  later editors allow it to pass unchallenged.  The principle which  guides this apparently unequal distribution of censure becomes  clear from 1Kings iii. 2: \"The people sacrificed upon the high  places, for as yet no house to the name of Jehovah had been  built.\"  Not until the house had been built to the name of  Jehovah--such is the idea--did the law come into force which  forbade having other places of worship besides./1/    **********************************  1. Compare 1Kings viii. 16.  According to Deut. xii.10 seq.,  the local unity of worship becomes law from the time when  the Israelites have found rest (menuha).  Comparing 2Samuel vii.11  and 1Kings v. 18 (A.V., v.4), we find that \"menuha\" first came in  with David and Solomon.  The period of the judges must at that time  have been regarded as much shorter than appears in the present chronology.  ***********************************    From the building of the temple of Solomon, which is also treated  as a leading epoch in chronology, a new period in the history of worship  is accordingly dated,--and to a certain extent with justice.  The monarchy in Israel owed its origin to the need which, under severe  external pressure, had come to be felt for bringing together  into the oneness of a people and a kingdom the hitherto  very loosely connected tribes and families of the Hebrews;  it had an avowedly centralising tendency, which very naturally  laid hold of the cultus as an appropriate means for the attainment  of the political end.  Gideon even, the first who came near  a regal position, erected a costly sanctuary in his city, Ophrah.  David caused the ark of Jehovah to be fetched into his fortress  on Mount Sion, and attached value to the circumstance  of having for its priest the representative of the old family  which had formerly kept it at Shiloh.  Solomon's temple also was  designed to increase the attractiveness of the city of his  residence.  It is indubitable that in this way political  centralisation gave an impulse to a greater centralisation of  worship also, and the tendency towards the latter continued to  operate after the separation of the two kingdoms,--in Israel not  quite in the same manner as in Judah.  Royal priests, great  national temples, festal gatherings of the whole people, sacrifices  on an enormous scale, these were the traits by which the cultus,  previously (as it would seem) very simple, now showed the impress  of a new time.  One other fact is significant: the domestic feasts  and sacrifices of single families, which in David's time must still  have been general, gradually declined and lost their importance as  social circles widened and life became more public.    But this way of regarding the influence of the monarchy upon the  history of the worship is not that of the author of the Books of  Kings.  He views the temple of Solomon as a work undertaken  exclusively in the interests of pure worship, and as differing  entirely in origin from the sacred buildings of the kings of  Israel, with which accordingly it is not compared, but contrasted  as the genuine is contrasted with the spurious.  It is in its  nature unique, and from the outset had the design of setting aside  all other holy places,--a religious design independent of and  unconnected with politics.  The view, however, is unhistorical; it  carries back to the original date of the temple, and imports into  the purpose of its foundation the significance which it had  acquired in Judah shortly before the exile.  In reality the  temple was not at the outset all that it afterwards became.  Its  influence was due to its own weight, and not to a monopoly  conferred by Solomon.  We nowhere learn that that king, like a  forerunner of Josiah, in order to favour his new sanctuary sought  to abolish all the others; there is not the faintest historical  trace of any such sudden and violent interference with the  previously existing arrangements of worship.  Never once did  Solomon's successors, confined though they were to the little  territory of Judah, and therefore in a position in which the  experiment might perhaps have been practicable, make the attempt  (which certainly would have been in their interest) to concentrate  all public worship within their own temple, though in other  directions we find them exercising a very arbitrary control over  affairs of religion.  The high places were not removed; this is  what is regularly told us in the case of them all.  For Israel  properly so called, Jerusalem was at no time, properly speaking,  the place which Jehovah had chosen; least of all was it so after  the division of the kingdom.    The Ephraimites flocked in troops through the entire length of the  southern kingdom as pilgrims to Beersheba, and, in common with the  men of Judah, to Gilgal on the frontier.  Jerusalem they left  unvisited.  In their own land they served Jehovah at Bethel and  Dan, at Shechem and Samaria, at Penuel and Mizpah, and at many  other places.  Every town had its Bamah, in the earlier times"]]]
