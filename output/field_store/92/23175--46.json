Our narrow breeches and long skirts only add  to the evidence, however uncomplimentary the idea may be to us.    Still, if you consider seriously, what are we to say when Science, in  the person of Darwin, concedes this hypothesis to the wisdom of ancient  Aryas. We must perforce submit. And, really, it is better to have for a  forefather Hanu-man, the poet, the hero, the god, than any other monkey,  even though it be a tailless one. Sita-Rama belongs to the category  of mythological dramas, something like the tragedies of Aeschylus.  Listening to this production of the remotest antiquity, the spectators  are carried back to the times when the gods, descending upon earth, took  an active part in the everyday life of mortals. Nothing reminds one of  a modern drama, though the exterior arrangement is the same. \"From the  sublime to the ridiculous there is but a step,\" and vice versa. The  goat, chosen for a sacrifice to Bacchus, presented the world tragedy  (greek script here). The death bleatings and buttings of the quadrupedal  offering of antiquity have been polished by the hands of time and of  civilization, and, as a result of this process, we get the dying  whisper of Rachel in the part of Adrienne Lecouvreur, and the fearfully  realistic \"kicking\" of the modern Croisette in the poisoning scene of  The Sphinx. But, whereas the descendants of Themistocles gladly receive,  whether captive or free, all the changes and improvements considered  as such by modern taste, thinking them to be a corrected and enlarged  edition of the genius of Aeschylus; Hindus, happily for archaeologists  and lovers of antiquity, have never moved a step since the times of our  much honoured forefather Hanuman.    We awaited the performance of Sita-Rama with the liveliest curiosity.  Except ourselves and the building of the theatre, everything was  strictly indigenous and nothing reminded us of the West. There was not  the trace of an orchestra. Music was only to be heard from the stage,  or from behind it. At last the curtain rose. The silence, which had been  very remarkable before the performance, considering the huge crowd  of spectators of both sexes, now became absolute. Rama is one of the  incarnations of Vishnu and, as most of the audience were worshippers of  Vishnu, for them the spectacle was not a mere theatrical performance,  but a religious mystery, representing the life and achievements of their  favourite and most venerated gods.    The prologue was laid in the epoch before creation began (it may safely  be said that no dramatist would dare to choose an earlier one)--or,  rather, before the last manifestation of the universe. All the  philosophical sects of India, except Mussulmans, agree that the universe  has always existed. But the Hindus divide the periodical appearances and  vanishings into days and nights of Brahma. The nights, or withdrawals of  the objective universe, are called Pralayas, and the days, or epochs  of new awakening into life and light, are called Manvantaras, Yugas, or  \"centuries of the gods.\" These periods are also called, respectively,  the inbreathings and outbreathings of Brahma. When Pralaya comes to an  end Brahma awakens, and, with this awakening, the universe that rested  in deity, in other words, that was reabsorbed in its subjective essence,  emanates from the divine principle and becomes visible. The gods, who  died at the same time as the universe, begin slowly to return to life.  The \"Invisible\" alone, the \"Infinite,\" the \"Lifeless,\" the One who is  the unconditioned original \"Life\" itself, soars, surrounded by shoreless  chaos. Its holy presence is not visible. It shows itself only in the  periodical pulsation of chaos, represented by a dark mass of waters  filling the stage. These waters are not, as yet, separated from the  dry land, because Brahma, the creative spirit of Narayana, has not yet  separated from the \"Ever Unchanging.\" Then comes a heavy shock of  the whole mass and the waters begin to acquire transparency. Rays,  proceeding from a golden egg at the bottom, spread through the chaotic  waters. Receiving life from the spirit of Narayana, the egg bursts and  the awakened Brahma rises to the surface of the water in the shape of a  huge lotus. Light clouds appear, at first transparent and web-like. They  gradually become condensed, and transform themselves into Prajapatis,  the ten personified creative powers of Brahma, the god of everything  living, and sing a hymn of praise to the creator. Something naively  poetical, to our unaccustomed ears, breathed in this uniform melody  unaccompanied by any orchestra.    The hour of general revival has struck. Pralaya comes to an end.  Everything rejoices, returning to life. The sky is separated from the  waters and on it appear the Asuras and Gandharvas, the heavenly singers  and musicians. Then Indra, Yama, Varuna, and Kuvera, the spirits  presiding over the four cardinal points, or the four elements, water,  fire, earth, and air, pour forth atoms, whence springs the serpent  \"Ananta.\" The monster swims to the surface of the waves and, bending its  swanlike neck, forms a couch on which Vishnu reclines with the Goddess  of Beauty, his wife Lakshmi, at his feet. \"Swatha! Swatha! Swatha!\"  cries the choir of heavenly musicians, hailing the deity. In the Russian  church service this is pronounced Swiat! Swiat! Swiat! and means holy!  holy! holy!    In one of his future avatars Vishnu will incarnate in Rama, the son of  a great king, and Lakshmi will become Sita. The motive of the whole poem  of Ramayana is sung in a few words by the celestial musicians. Kama, the  God of Love, shelters the divine couple and, that very moment, a flame  is lit in their hearts and the whole world is created.    Later there are performed the fourteen acts of the drama, which is well  known to everybody, and in which several hundred personages take part.  At the end of the prologue the whole assembly of gods come forward,  one after another, and acquaint the audience with the contents and the  epilogue of their performance, asking the public not to be too exacting.  It is as though all these familiar deities, made of painted granite and  marble, left the temples and came down to remind mortals of events long  past and forgotten.    The hall was full of natives. We four alone were representatives of  Europe. Like a huge flower bed, the women displayed the bright colors of  their garments. Here and there, among handsome, bronze-like heads, were  the pretty, dull white faces of Parsee women, whose beauty reminded me  of the Georgians. The front rows were occupied by women only. In India  it is quite easy to learn a person's religion, sect, and caste, and even  whether a woman is married or single, from the marks painted in bright  colors on everyone's forehead.    Since the time when Alexander the Great destroyed the sacred books of  the Gebars, they have constantly been oppressed by the idol worshippers.  King Ardeshir-Babechan restored fire worship in the years 229-243 A.C.  Since then they have again been persecuted during the reign of one of  the Shakpurs, either II., IX., or XI., of the Sassanids, but which of  them is not known. It is, however, reported that one of them was a great  protector of the Zartushta doctrines. After the fall of Yesdejird,  the fire-worshippers emigrated to the island of Ormasd, and, some time  later, having found a book of Zoroastrian prophecies, in obedience to  one of them they set out for Hindustan. After many wanderings,  they appeared, about 1,000 or 1,200 years ago, in the territory of  Maharana-Jayadeva, a vassal of the Rajput King Champanir, who allowed  them to colonize his land, but only on condition that they laid down  their weapons, that they abandoned the Persian language for Hindi, and  that their women put off their national dress and clothed themselves  after the manner of Hindu women. He, however, allowed them to wear  shoes, since this is strictly prescribed by Zoroaster. Since then very  few changes have been made. It follows that the Parsee women could only  be distinguished from their Hindu sisters by very slight differences.  The almost white faces of the former were separated by a strip of smooth  black hair from a sort of white cap, and the whole was covered with a  bright veil. The latter wore no covering on their rich, shining hair,  twisted into a kind of Greek chignon. Their foreheads were brightly  painted, and their nostrils adorned with golden rings. Both are fond of  bright, but uniform, colors, both cover their arms up to the elbow with  bangles, and both wear saris.    Behind the women a whole sea of most wonderful turbans was waving in the  pit. There were long-haired Rajputs with regular Grecian features and  long beards parted in the middle, their heads covered with \"pagris\"  consisting of, at least, twenty yards of finest white muslin, and  their persons adorned with earrings and necklaces; there were Mahrata  Brahmans, who shave their heads, leaving only one long central lock, and  wear turbans of blinding red, decorated in front with a sort of golden  horn of plenty; Bangas, wearing three-cornered helmets with a kind of  cockscomb on the top; Kachhis, with Roman helmets; Bhillis, from the  borders of Rajastan, whose chins are wrapped three times in the ends  of their pyramidal turbans, so that the innocent tourist never fails to  think that they constantly suffer from toothache; Bengalis and Calcutta  Babus, bare-headed all the year round, their hair cut after an Athenian  fashion, and their bodies clothed in the proud folds of a white  toga-virilis, in no way different from those once worn by Roman  senators; Parsees, in their black, oilcloth mitres; Sikhs, the followers  of Nanaka, strictly monotheist and mystic,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6693"],[0,"People of Africa (#7)"],[1,"these people are still very ignorant and miserable.  When they find  out that it is better to be peaceful and work to help each other, then  they will be able to grow wise and strong like the other Central  African people in Uganda, and like the dark-skinned people of South  Africa whom we shall read about in the next chapter.                                      VI                               -----------                     THE MINE-WORKERS OF SOUTH AFRICA                       1. The Cooler Land of the South    The Congo rivers and another great river called the Zambezi stretch  right across Africa from east to west.  North of this the country is  called Central Africa, about some of whose people we have been  reading.  South of it across the Zambezi lies South Africa.  East and  west of this land is the salt sea, on the east called the Indian  Ocean, on the west the Atlantic Ocean.  As we travel south the country  gets narrower and narrower, until the two great oceans meet at the  Cape of Good Hope.  Near the Congo and the Zambezi towards Central  Africa the sun is very hot, but as we journey southwards it gets  cooler.  When we reach the colder lands of the south we find that the  grass and maize do not grow so tall, and that there are no great  forests.  For long distances the land stretches as far as we can see,  covered with short grass, but there are no trees.  This kind of  country is called \"veld\" in South Africa.  There are some waterless  deserts here, too, but none so large as the Sahara in North Africa.  In other parts there are rivers, though some of them dry up in the  summer and only have water in the rainy season.  In South Africa, as  in Central Africa, it rains some months of the year and is dry the  others.                              2. Black and White    In South Africa there are two races of people living side by side.  First, there are dark-skinned Africans like those of Uganda and the  Congo.  These belong to many tribes, each speaking its own language.  Secondly, there are many Europeans who, about three hundred years ago,  began to come across the great salt sea to live in South Africa.  Their own countries in Europe were too small for all the people in  them, but South Africa is so large that there was plenty of room.  These Europeans live in houses of brick or stone, and wear the same  kind of clothes which are worn by the people in Europe.  Their skins  are lighter-coloured than even those of the Egyptians and Arabs of  North Africa, and their hair is straight and often very fair.  There  are two chief European peoples in South Africa, the English and the  Dutch.  These speak different languages, but many of them can speak  both.  Europeans, as perhaps you know, are very clever at making  machines of iron to work for them.  They have made motor-cars to carry  them quickly along ordinary roads, and another machine called an  \"engine\" which draws many cars on its own road, which is made of two  iron rails.    Among the African people of South Africa there are many different  customs, but most people live in their own villages very much like  those of Central Africa.  Some tribes keep great herds of cattle,  which find plenty of food on the grassy plains of the \"veldt.\" Many  have learned to copy European customs, especially those living near  the great European towns.  Some go long distances to work in these  towns, especially in places where gold or other valuable things are  found under the ground in the \"mines.\" It is about these men who work  on the mines that we will read now.                             3. Work in the Mines    When men first found gold in the ground it was near the surface, and  was not very difficult to get.  But when this had all been taken, they  had to dig deeper and deeper, until at last they found it easier to  cut out roads and rooms far down underneath the ground, and to look  for the gold among the earth and stones they found there.  Perhaps you  wonder how the miners get so deep down in the earth every day.  There  are no steps, but they get into a kind of cage called a \"lift,\" which  slips down on a rope skip into a deep hole called a \"shaft,\" to where  they want to work.  It is a wonderful machine, something like a  motor-car, only it goes down into the earth instead of along the top.  When the men get out of the skip down in the mine, there are many  different roads in it, and each man has to go to his own part to work.  When he reaches his place he has to drill holes in the rock for the  dynamite which breaks up the rock, and the loose stones are taken away  along the roads to the lift and then up to the top.  There it is  stamped with great hammers into dust, and washed, until the gold-dust  is separated from the rest.  There are thousands of men, both  underground and at the top, always at work at the mines.    Down in the mines it is always dark because the sunlight cannot get  down there, and so the people have to use lanterns.  In the larger  openings there are lamps fixed to the walls and ceilings lighted by  \"electricity.\" Although it is dark below the ground, we must not  think it is cold.  On the contrary, it is very hot and difficult to  breathe, because there is no wind, so that the bad air does not get  cleared away.  It is hot and stuffy, like a house where people have  been sleeping all night with no windows open.  When people first made  mines, a great many died because of the bad air and because of fires,  but now they have machines which blow good air down into the ground,  and electric and other lamps which do not set fire to things easily,  and so there are not many people killed in the mines now.  Nevertheless, it is very hard and tiring work, and men are often ill  because of the dust which fills the air they breathe.  So the  Europeans to whom the mines belong pay for doctors and hospitals  where the sick can be cared for until they are well.    Many valuable minerals, besides gold, are found in South Africa, but  the chief mines are for gold, diamonds, and coal.  Diamonds are  beautiful stones, clear like water, which flash red, blue, and green  when they are turned about.  They are very hard, and are sometimes  used to cut glass.  But they are valuable because European and Indian  ladies will pay large prices for them, as they like to wear them as  ornaments.  Coal is a hard, black, shiny mineral used for burning.  It  makes better fires than wood, and burns much longer.  These  three--gold, diamonds, and coal--are the chief things found in mines  in South Africa.  But in other countries men find iron and silver and  copper (of which pennies are made), and tin and salt, and many other  useful things, in mines dug deep under the ground.                            4. How the Miners Live    People often come from very long distances to work in the diamond  mines at Kimberley and in the gold mines at Johannesburg.  Sometimes  they walk, but in South Africa there are railways and trains to take  people to all the large towns, and a person can travel in one day by  train as far as he could walk in three or four days.    Very few people spend all their lives at the mines.  Most of the  workers come for six months or a year, because they want money for  clothes or food, as well as to buy cattle to pay the dowry for the  girls they wish to marry.  When they arrive at the mines, after their  long journey, their names are written in a book as miners, and they  are given places where they can live.  If the men are single they live  together in a large compound, which is a place enclosed by walls and  gates.  In these compounds there are houses where the men sleep, and  places where they can do their washing, and the European mine masters  provide people to clean these houses and to do the cooking.    If the workman has a wife he is given a house in a mine village,  called a \"location.\" A location or a compound is like a village with a  great number of houses placed close together along straight roads.  The houses are sometimes built of stones or bricks, but more often of  corrugated iron.    In each location there are hundreds of people who have come to work at  the mines for a few months from different parts of South Africa.  They  are all strangers to each other and speak many different languages.  Most of them try to copy the dress of Europeans; but as European  clothes are very expensive to buy and soon wear out, the natives often  look ragged and dirty in them.    These native workers in the mines are supplied with food, such as  maize, corn, and meal; but there are shops in the locations and  compounds where they can buy other food, such as tea, coffee, sugar,  and bread, and where they can also get clothes and other European  things.    There are hospitals with doctors and nurses at all the mines to attend  to the sick and the injured.  There are also schools for the children  in the location.  It is difficult to teach in these schools because  the children speak different languages, and their parents only stay  for a short time.  But a great many do learn to read, write, to do  sums, and to sew.    The country near the mines is very often dry and dusty.  There are no  fields nor trees, unless planted by Europeans.    There are many laws regulating the life and work of the native miner;  for example, he must go to work every day unless the doctor says he is  too ill to do so.  At night every one must be in the location, unless  he be given a letter, which is called a \"pass,\" from his master giving  the reason why he is not in the location.                          5. Strict Laws for Miners    The reason for these laws is that all these people are far away from  their homes, and often no one can speak their language.  Their  relations and chiefs are far away and cannot help them, and so the  Government has to make laws to prevent bad people robbing and perhaps  killing them.
