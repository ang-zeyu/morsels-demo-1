In Esperanto the terminations \"-ata\", \"being\", denoting \"incompleteness\"  or \"present\" time, \"-ita\", \"having been\", denoting \"completeness\"  or \"past\" time, and \"-ota\", \"about to be\" (going to be), denoting  \"action not yet begun\", or \"future\" time, are added to the root of the  verb, as \"ami\", to love, \"amata\", being loved, \"amita\", having been  loved, \"amota\", going to be loved. \"La sxtelisto estas sercxata de la  policanoj\" [Footnote: \"De\" is used after these participles to denote the  \"doer\" of the action.], The thief is being searched for by the police.  \"La fenestro estas rompita\", The window has been broken. \"La laboro  estas finota morgaux\", The work is going to be finished to-morrow.    It will be seen that these words ending in \"-ata\", \"-ita\", \"-ota\"  describe the subject or show the \"condition\" or \"state\" in which  the subject is, therefore they are adjectival; the thief is a  \"searched-for\" thief, the window was a \"broken\" window, the work  is a \"going-to-be-finished\" work (compare The work will be \"ready\"  to-morrow). They are called PARTICIPLES, and being adjectival, take  \"j\" when the noun to which they belong is plural.         Mi estas tenata ............. I am (being) held.     Li estis tenata .............

The one who is being beaten.     La batito ....... The one who has been beaten.     La batoto ....... The one who is about to be beaten.      Note that the participles which have \"n\" in the termination refer to the  \"doer\"; they are called \"active\" participles. Those without \"n\" refer to  the one to whom the action is done; they are \"passive\" participles.

Then the thing may be said to have begun.    Yes, said Burge, interrogated on the point five minutes later, he  _had_ had enough.    \"Good,\" said Thomas pleasantly. \"Want a handkerchief?\"    That evening he wrote to his mother and, thanking her for kind  inquiries, stated that he was not being bullied. He added, also in  answer to inquiries, that he had not been tossed in a blanket, and  that--so far--no Hulking Senior (with scowl) had let him down from the  dormitory window after midnight by a sheet, in order that he might  procure gin from the local public-house. As far as he could gather,  the seniors were mostly teetotallers. Yes, he had seen Spencer several  times. He did not add that he had seen him from a distance.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I'm so glad I asked Mrs. Davy to get her nephew to look after Tom,\"  said Mrs. Shearne, concluding the reading of the epistle at breakfast.  \"It makes such a difference to a new boy having somebody to protect  him at first.\"    \"Only drawback is,\" said his eldest brother gloomily--\"won't get cheek  knocked out of him. Tom's kid wh'ought get'sheadsmacked reg'ly. Be no  holding him.\"    And he helped himself to marmalade, of which delicacy his mouth was  full, with a sort of magnificent despondency.    By the end of the first fortnight of his school career, Thomas  Beauchamp Algernon had overcome all the little ruggednesses which  relieve the path of the new boy from monotony. He had been taken in by  a primaeval \"sell\" which the junior day-room invariably sprang on the  new-comer. But as he had sat on the head of the engineer of the same  for the space of ten minutes, despite the latter's complaints of pain  and forecasts of what he would do when he got up, the laugh had not  been completely against him. He had received the honourable  distinction of extra lesson for ragging in French. He had been  \"touched up\" by the prefect of his dormitory for creating a  disturbance in the small hours. In fact, he had gone through all the  usual preliminaries, and become a full-blown Eckletonian.    His letters home were so cheerful at this point that a second postal  order relieved the dwindling fortune of Spencer. And it was this,  coupled with the remonstrances of Phipps, that induced the Dencroftian  to break through his icy reserve.    \"Look here, Spencer,\" said Phipps, his conscience thoroughly stirred  by this second windfall, \"it's all rot. You must either send back that  postal order, or go and see the chap. Besides, he's quite a decent  kid. We're in the same game at cricket. He's rather a good bowler. I'm  getting to know him quite well. I've got a jolly sight more right to  those postal orders than you have.\"    \"But he's an awful ass to look at,\" pleaded Spencer.    \"What's wrong with him? Doesn't look nearly such a goat as you,\" said  Phipps, with the refreshing directness of youth.    \"He's got yellow hair,\" argued Spencer.    \"Why shouldn't he have?\"    \"He looks like a sort of young Sunday-school kid.\"    \"Well, he jolly well isn't, then, because I happen to know that he's  had scraps with some of the fellows in his house, and simply mopped  them.\"    \"Well, all right, then,\" said Spencer reluctantly.    The historic meeting took place outside the school shop at the quarter  to eleven interval next morning. Thomas was leaning against the wall,  eating a bun. Spencer approached him with half a jam sandwich in his  hand. There was an awkward pause.    \"Hullo!\" said Spencer at last.    \"Hullo!\" said Thomas.    Spencer finished his sandwich and brushed the crumbs off his trousers.  Thomas continued operations on the bun with the concentrated  expression of a lunching python.    \"I believe your people know my people,\" said Spencer.    \"We have some awfully swell friends,\" said Thomas. Spencer chewed this  thoughtfully awhile.    \"Beastly cheek,\" he said at last.    \"Sorry,\" said Thomas, not looking it.    Spencer produced a bag of gelatines.    \"Have one?\" he asked.    \"What's wrong with 'em?\"    \"All right, don't.\"    He selected a gelatine and consumed it.    \"Ever had your head smacked?\" he inquired courteously.    A slightly strained look came into Thomas's blue eyes.    \"Not often,\" he replied politely. \"Why?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Spencer. \"I was only wondering.\"    \"Oh?\"    \"Look here,\" said Spencer, \"my mater told me to look after you.\"    \"Well, you can look after me now if you want to, because I'm going.\"    And Thomas dissolved the meeting by walking off in the direction of  the junior block.    \"That kid,\" said Spencer to his immortal soul, \"wants his head  smacked, badly.\"    At lunch Phipps had questions to ask.    \"Saw you talking to Shearne in the interval,\" he said. \"What were you  talking about?\"    \"Oh, nothing in particular.\"    \"What did you think of him?\"    \"Little idiot.\"    \"Ask him to tea this afternoon?\"    \"No.\"    \"You must. Dash it all, you must do something for him. You've had ten  bob out of his people.\"    Spencer made no reply.    Going to the school shop that afternoon, he found Thomas seated there  with Phipps, behind a pot of tea. As a rule, he and Phipps tea'd  together, and he resented this desertion.    \"Come on,\" said Phipps. \"We were waiting for you.\"    \"Pining away,\" added Thomas unnecessarily.    Spencer frowned austerely.    \"Come and look after me,\" urged Thomas.    Spencer sat down in silence. For a minute no sound could be heard but  the champing of Thomas's jaws as he dealt with a slab of gingerbread.    \"Buck up,\" said Phipps uneasily.    \"Give me,\" said Thomas, \"just one loving look.\"    Spencer ignored the request. The silence became tense once more.    \"Coming to the house net, Phipps?\" asked Spencer.    \"We were going to the baths. Why don't you come?\"    \"All right,\" said Spencer.    Doctors tell us that we should allow one hour to elapse between taking  food and bathing, but the rule was not rigidly adhered to at Eckleton.  The three proceeded straight from the tea-table to the baths.    The place was rather empty when they arrived. It was a little earlier  than the majority of Eckletonians bathed. The bath filled up as lock-up  drew near. With the exception of a couple of infants splashing about in  the shallow end, and a stout youth who dived in from the spring-board,  scrambled out, and dived in again, each time flatter than the last, they  had the place to themselves.    \"What's it like, Gorrick,\" inquired Phipps of the stout youth, who had  just appeared above the surface again, blowing like a whale. The  question was rendered necessary by the fact that many years before the  boiler at the Eckleton baths had burst, and had never been repaired,  with the consequence that the temperature of the water was apt to  vary. That is to say, most days it was colder than others.    \"Simply boiling,\" said the man of weight, climbing out. \"I say, did I  go in all right then?\"    \"Not bad,\" said Phipps.    \"Bit flat,\" added Thomas critically.    Gorrick blinked severely at the speaker. A head-waiter at a  fashionable restaurant is cordial in his manner compared with a boy  who has been at a public school a year, when addressed familiarly by a  new boy. After reflecting on the outrage for a moment, he dived in  again.    \"Worse than ever,\" said Truthful Thomas.    \"Look here!\" said Gorrick.    \"Oh, come _on_!\" exclaimed Phipps, and led Thomas away.    \"That kid,\" said Gorrick to Spencer, \"wants his head smacked, badly.\"    \"That's just what I say,\" agreed Spencer, with the eagerness of a  great mind which has found another that thinks alike with itself.    Spencer was the first of the trio ready to enter the water. His  movements were wary and deliberate. There was nothing of the  professional diver about Spencer. First he stood on the edge and  rubbed his arms, regarding the green water beneath with suspicion and  dislike. Then, crouching down, he inserted three toes of his left  foot, drew them back sharply, and said \"Oo!\" Then he stood up again.  His next move was to slap his chest and dance a few steps, after which  he put his right foot into the water, again remarked \"Oo!\" and resumed  Position I.    \"Thought you said it was warm,\" he shouted to Gorrick.    \"So it is; hot as anything. Come on in.\"    And Spencer came on in. Not because he wanted to--for, by rights,  there were some twelve more movements to be gone through before he  should finally creep in at the shallow end--but because a cold hand,  placed suddenly on the small of his back, urged him forward. Down he  went, with the water fizzing and bubbling all over and all round him.  He swallowed a good deal of it, but there was still plenty left; and  what there was was colder than one would have believed possible.    He came to the surface after what seemed to him a quarter of an hour,  and struck out for the side. When he got out, Phipps and Thomas had  just got in. Gorrick was standing at the end of the cocoanut matting  which formed a pathway to the spring-board. Gorrick was blue, but  determined.    \"I say! Did I go in all right then?\" inquired Gorrick.    \"How the dickens do I know?\" said Spencer, stung to fresh wrath by the  inanity of the question.    \"Spencer did,\" said Thomas, appearing in the water below them and  holding on to the rail.    \"Look here!\" cried Spencer; \"did you shove me in then?\"    \"Me! Shove!\" Thomas's voice expressed horror and pain. \"Why, you dived  in. Jolly good one, too. Reminded me of the diving elephants at the  Hippodrome.\"    And he swam off.    \"That kid,\" said Gorrick, gazing after him, \"wants his head smacked.\"    \"Badly,\" agreed Spencer. \"Look here! did he shove me in? Did you see  him?\"    \"I was doing my dive. But it must have been him. Phipps never rags in  the bath.\"    Spencer grunted--an expressive grunt--and, creeping down the steps,  entered the water again.    It was Spencer's ambition to swim ten lengths of the bath.
