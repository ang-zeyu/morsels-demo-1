Besides  this danger, the presence of pigs on the run keeps the sheep in an  excited state. They have an uneasy consciousness that their foes are  looking after them, and they move restlessly up and down the hills, not  stopping to feed sufficiently to get fat. If a sheep-farmer thinks his  sheep are not in good condition, one of the first questions he asks  his shepherd is, \"Are there any pigs about?\" Our run had a good many of  these troublesome visitors on it, especially in the winter, when they  would travel down from the back country to grub up acres on acres of  splendid sheep pasture in search of roots. The only good they do is to  dig up the Spaniards for the sake of their delicious white fibres, and  the fact of their being able to do this will give a better idea of the  toughness of a wild pig's snout than anything else I can say.    It may be strange to English ears to hear a woman of tolerably peaceful  disposition, and as the advertisements in the _Times_ so often state,  \"thoroughly domesticated,\" aver that she found great pleasure in going  after wild pigs; but the circumstances of the ease must be taken into  consideration before I am condemned. First of all, it seemed terribly  lonely at home if F---- was out with his rifle all day. Next, there was  the temptation to spend those delicious hours of a New Zealand winter's  day, between ten and four, out of doors, wandering over hills and  exploring new gullies. And lastly, I had a firm idea that I was taking  care of F----. And so I was in a certain sense, for if his rifle had  burst, or any accident had happened to him, and he had been unable to  reach the homestead, we should never have known where to find him, and  days would probably have passed before every nook and corner of a run  extending over many thousand acres could have been thoroughly searched.    I had heard terrible stories of shepherds slipping down and injuring  themselves so that they could not move, and of their dead bodies being  only found after weeks of careful seeking. F---- himself delighted to  terrify me by descriptions of narrow escapes; and, as the pigs had to  be killed, I resolved to follow in the hunter's train. The sport is  conducted exactly like deer stalking, only it is much harder work, and a  huge boar is not so picturesque an object as a stag of many tines, when  you do catch sight of him. There is just the same accurate knowledge  needed of the animal's habits and customs, and the same untiring  patience. It is quite as necessary to be a good shot, for a grey pig  standing under the lee of a boulder of exactly his own colour is a much  more difficult object to hit from the opposite side of a ravine than a  stag; and a wild boar is every whit as keen of scent and sharp of eye  and ear as any antlered \"Monarch of the Glen.\"    Imagine then a beautiful winter's morning without wind or rain. There  has been perhaps a sharp frost over-night, but after a couple of hours  of sunshine the air is as warm and bright as midsummer. We used to be  glad enough of a wood fire at breakfast; but after that meal had been  eaten we went into the verandah, open to the north-east (our warm  quarter), which made a delicious winter parlour, and basked in the  blazing sunshine. I used often to bring out a chair and a table, and  work and read there all the morning, without either hat or jacket. But  it sometimes happened that once or twice a week, on just such a lovely  morning, F---- would proclaim his intention of going out to look for  pigs, and, sooner than be left behind, I nearly always begged to be  allowed to come too. There was no fear of my getting tired or lagging  behind; and as I was willing to make myself generally useful, by  carrying the telescope, a revolver for close quarters, and eke a few  sandwiches, the offer of my company used to be graciously accepted. We  could seldom procure the loan of a good pig-dog, and after one excursion  with a certain dog of the name of \"Pincher,\" I preferred going out by  ourselves.     On that occasion F---- did not take his rifle, as there was no  chance of getting a long shot at our game; for the dog would surely  bring the pig to bay, and then the hunter must trust to a revolver or  the colonial boar-spear, half a pair of shears (I suppose it should be  called _a shear_) bound firmly on a flax stick by green flax-leaves. We  had heard of pigs having been seen by our out-station shepherd at the  back of the run, and as we were not encumbered by the heavy rifle, we  mounted our horses and rode as far as we could towards the range where  the pigs had been grubbing up the hill sides in unmolested security for  some time past. Five miles from home the ground became so rough that  our horses could go no further; we therefore jumped off, tied them to  a flax-bush, taking off the saddles in case they broke loose, and  proceeded on foot over the jungly, over-grown saddle. On the other side  we came upon a beautiful gully, with a creek running through it, whose  banks were so densely fringed with scrub that we could not get through  to the stream, which we heard rippling amid the tangled shrubs. If we  could only have reached the water our best plan would have been to get  into it and follow its windings up the ravine; but even Pincher could  hardly squeeze and burrow through the impenetrable fence of matapo and  goi, which were woven together by fibres of a thorny creeper called \"a  lawyer\" by the shepherds.      It was very tantalising, for in less than five minutes we heard trusty  Pincher \"speaking\" to a boar, and knew that he had baled it up against a  tree, and was calling to us to come and help him. F----ran about like a  lunatic, calling out; \"Coming Pincher: round him up, good dog!\" and so  forth; but they were all vain promises, for he could not get in. I did  my best in searching for an opening, and gave many false hopes of having  found one. At last I said, \"If I run up the mountain side, and look down  on that mass of scrub, perhaps I may see some way into it from above.\"  \"No: do you stay here, and see, if the pig breaks cover, which way  he goes.\" Up the steep hill, therefore, F---- rushed, as swiftly and  lightly as one of his own mountain sheep; and in a minute or two I  saw him standing, revolver in hand, on an overhanging rock, peering  anxiously down on the leafy mass below.    Pincher and the creek made such a noise between them that I could not  hear what F---- said, and only guessed from his despairing gestures that  there was no trap door visible in the green roof. I signalled as well as  I could that he was to come down directly, for his-standing-place looked  most insecure. Insecure indeed it proved. As I spoke the great fragment  of rock loosely embedded in earth on the mountain side gave way with a  crash, and came tumbling majestically down on the top of the scrub.  As for F----, he described a series of somersaults in the air, which  however agreeable in themselves, were very trying to the nerves of the  spectatrix below. My first dread was least the rock should crush him,  but to my great joy I saw at once that it was rolling slowly down the  hill, whilst F----'s vigorous bound off it as it gave way, had carried  him well into the middle of the leafy cushion beneath him, where he  presently landed flat on his back!    I expected every moment to hear the revolver go off, but mercifully it  did not do so; and as his thorny bed was hardly to be endured, F----  soon kicked himself off it, and before I could realize that he was  unhurt, had scrambled to his feet, and was rushing off, crying in  school-boy glee, \"That will fetch him out\" That (the rock) certainly did  fetch him (the pig) out in a moment, and Pincher availed himself of the  general confusion to seize hold of his enemy's hind leg, which he never  afterwards let go. The boar kept snapping and champing his great tusks;  but Pincher, even with the leg in his mouth, was too active to be  caught: so as the boar found that it was both futile and undignified  to try to run away with a dog hanging on his hind-quarters, he tried  another plan. Making for a clump of Ti-ti palms he went to bay, and  contrived to take up a very good defensive position. Pincher would have  never given up his mouthful of leg if F---- had not called him off, for  it seemed impossible to fire the revolver whilst the dog held on. This  change of tactics was much against Pincher's judgment, and he kept  rushing furiously in between F---- and the boar. As for me, I prudently  retired behind a big boulder, on which I could climb if the worst came  to the worst, and called out from time to time, to both dog and man,  \"Oh, don't!\"    They did not even hear me, for the din of battle was loud. The pig  dodged about so fast, that although F----'s bullets lodged in the palm  tree at his back, not one struck a vulnerable part, and at last F----,  casting his revolver behind him for me to pick up and reload, closed  with his foe, armed only with the shear-spear. Pincher considered  this too dangerous, and rushed in between them to distract the boar's  attention. Just as F---- aimed a thrust at his chest,--for it was of  no use trying to penetrate his hide,--the boar lowered his head,  caught poor faithful Pincher's exposed flank, and tore it open with his  razor-like tusk; but in the meantime the spear had gone well home into  his brawny chest, exactly beneath the left shoulder, and his life-blood  came gushing out. I was so infuriated at the sight of Pincher's  frightful wound that I felt none of my usual pity for the victim;  and rushing up to F---- with the revolver, of which only a couple of  chambers were loaded, thrust it into his hand with an entreaty to \"kill  him quickly.\" This F---- was quite willing to do for his own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#7)"],[1," scattered and the old plantation devastated. The three with their  families journeyed to Texas--the then Land of Promise! At twenty-five  cents an acre they bought river-bottom lands which are to-day  priceless, and the losses of the past were soon forgotten in the rapid  prosperity of the following years.    Mrs. McDonald represented all that high type of character which the  dark years of the war brought out in so many instances of Southern  womanhood. Patient, hopeful, uncomplaining she lived through the four  years of war-time separation, left her own people and journeyed to the  Southwest to begin life anew. She was particularly robust of physique,  domestic in a high sense, gentle and deeply kind. She passed through  hardship, privation and prosperity practically not knowing sickness.  Her children could not have had better mother-stock, and the scant  days were in the past, so they never knew the lack of plenty. There  were eight, from Edith, born in 1870, to Frank, in 1885, including the  twins.    Did whiskey-drinking hurt?    Edith grew into a slender, retiring girl, her paleness accentuated by  her black hair. She was quiet, read much, and took little interest in  out-of-door activities, entering into the play-life of the other  children but rarely. Her father insisted, later, on her riding, and  she became a fair horsewoman. She was refined in all her relations.  Edith went to New Orleans at seventeen. The spring after, she  developed a hacking cough and had one or two slight hemorrhages, but  at twenty was better and married an excellent young merchant. The  child was born when she was twenty-two; three weeks later the mother  died, leaving a pitiable, scrofulous baby, which medical and nursing  skill kept lingering eighteen months.    The first boy was named James, Jr., as we should expect, and, as we  should not expect, was never called \"Jim.\" But James was not right. He  developed slowly, did not walk till over three, was talking poorly at  five; he was subject to convulsions and destructive outbreaks; he was  uncertain and clumsy in his movements, so provision was made that he  might always have some one with him. But even in the face of this  care, he stumbled and fell into the laundry-pot with its boiling  family-wash, was badly scalded and seriously blinded. James mercifully  died two years later in one of his convulsions.    Mabel was the flower of the family. Through her girlhood she was  lovable in every way, and beloved. She was blond like her father,  though not as robust as either father or mother, and in ideals and  character was truly the latter's daughter. She finished in a finishing  school, had musical ability and charm, and soon married and made a  happy home--an unusual home, until the birth of the first child. Since  then it has been a fight for health, with the pall of her family's  history smothering each rekindling hope. Operations and sanatoria,  health-resorts and specialists have not restored, and she lives, a  neurasthenic mother of two neurotic children. Happiness has long fled  the home where it so loved to bide those early days, before the strain  and stress of maternity had drained the mother's poor reserve of  vitality.    The history of Will and John, named for the two uncles, would prove  racy reading through many chapters. \"The Twins\" were the father's text  for spicy stories galore many years before their death. From the  first, they were \"two young sinners.\" They both had active minds--  overactive in devising deviltry. Mischievous as little fellows, never  punished, practically never corrected by their father, humored by  sisters, house-servants, and the plantation-hands, feared and admired  by other boys, they seemed proof against any helpful influence from  the earnest, pained, prayerful mother. As boys of ten, they had become  \"town talk\" and were held responsible for all pranks and practical  jokes perpetrated in Donaldsville or thereabout, unless other guilty  ones were captured red-handed. Multiply your conception of a \"bad boy\"  by two and you will have Will at twelve; repeat the process and you  will have John. They possessed one quality--dare we call it virtue?--  which kept them dear to Doctor Jim's heart through their very worst.  They never lied to him, no matter what their misdeeds. They could lie  as veritable troopers, but from him the truth in its rankest boldness  was never withheld. As the years passed, they made many and deep  excursions into the old doctor's pocket. But he paid the bills  cheerfully and sent his reverberating laugh chasing the speedy  dollars, as soon as he got with some of his Main Street cronies. The  boys planned and worked together, protecting each other most cleverly.  Still they were expelled from every school they attended after they  were thirteen. A military academy noted for its ability to handle hard  cases found them quite too mature in their wild ways, and sent them  home. They may, for reasons best known to themselves, have been  \"square with the old man,\" but they were a pair of thoroughgoing  toughs by twenty, not only fast but cruel, even brutal, in their evil-  doing.    Will was the first to show the strain of the pace. When twenty-two,  the warning cough sobered him a bit, and in John's faithful and  congenial company, he went first to Denver, then to New Mexico.  Doctors' orders were irksome, whiskey and cards the only available  recreation for the boys, and so they tried to follow their father's  example in developing a powerful physique on Kentucky Bourbon  (\"best\"). John suddenly quit drinking. \"Acute nephritis\" was on the  shipping paster. Delirium tremens was the truth. Will was too frail to  accompany his brother's remains home. He was pretty lonely and  anxious, and miserable without John, but for several weeks behaved  quite to the doctor's satisfaction. It didn't last long, and within  the year tuberculosis and Bourbon laid him beside his brother.    May was a promising girl, \"almost a hoiden,\" the neighbors said. She  rode the ponies bareback; she played boys' games, and at twelve looked  as though the problem of health could never complicate her glad, young  life. But cough and hemorrhage, twin specters, stalked in at sixteen  and the poor child fairly melted away and was gone in a year.    Annabel, the youngest girl, was a quiet child and thoughtful. Some  called her dull, but rather, it seems, she early sensed her fate. When  but a child she was sent to \"San Antone\" and operated on by a throat  specialist. After May's death she went to the mountains each summer  and spent two winters in South Texas. But she grew more and more thin,  and in the end it was tuberculosis.    Frank, the last child, was different from all the others. He seemed  bright of mind and active of body. He attended school as had none of  the other boys; he even went to Sunday-school. Physically and  mentally, he gave promise of prolonging the family line--but he proved  his father's only admitted regret. He lied and he stole. The money  which his father would have given him freely he preferred to get by  cunning. Doctor Jim could not tolerate what he called dishonesty, and  from time to time they would have words and Frank would be gone for  months. His cleverness made him a fairly successful gambler; that he  played the game \"crooked\" is probably evidenced by his being shot in a  gambling-joint before he was thirty.    We have thus scanned the-wreckage of a generation bred in alcohol.  Children they were of unusual physical and mental parentage, parents  who never knowingly offended their consciences, children reared in  most healthful surroundings with every comfort and opportunity for  normal development. Four of them showed their physical inferiority  through the early infection and unusually poor resistance to  tuberculosis; one was born an imbecile; one died directly from the  effects of drink; the only girl who survived early maturity, the best  of them all, spent twenty years a nervous sufferer, mothering two  nervously defective children; the physically best was the morally  worst and died a criminal.    Doctor Jim lived on with his habits unchanged, his laugh, only, losing  something in volume and more in infectiousness. Still proud of his  health he preached the gospel of good whiskey well drunk, never  sensing his part in the tragedy of his own fireside. He was nearly  eighty when the stroke came which bereft him of any possibility of  understanding, or of knowing remorse. He had laid his wife away some  years previously and for months he lingered on paralyzed, demented, in  the big, empty house, cared for by an old negro couple, hardly  recognizing Mabel when she came twice a year, but never forgetting  that, \"Whiskey won't hurt anybody.\"          CHAPTER V    THE NERVOUSLY DAMAGED MOTHER      His name is not Lawrence Adams Abbott. The surname really is that of  one of America's first families. He, himself, is among the few living  of a third generation of large wealth.    It was an early-summer afternoon and Dr. Abbott--for he was a graduate  of Cornell Medical--was standing at one of the train gates of the  Grand Central Station in New York. As he waits apart from the small  crowd assembled to welcome, he attracts observing attention. His face  appears thirty; he is thirty-six. The features are finely cut, the  chin is especially good. The eyes are blue-gray, and a slight pallor  probably adds to his apparent distinction. His attitude is languid,  the handling of his cane gracefully indolent, the almost habitual  twisting of his chestnut-brown mustache attractively self-satisfied.  His clothing is handsome, of distinctive materials, and tailored to  the day. So much for an observing estimate. The critical observer  would note more. He would detect a sluggishness in the responses of  the pupils, as the eyes listlessly travel from face to face, producing  an effect of haunting dulness. Mumbling movements "]]]
