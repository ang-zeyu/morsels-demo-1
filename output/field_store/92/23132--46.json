As we have been indebted to a revelation which God made of himself  to his creatures in the first instance, for the idea of his existence,  so in like manner we are indebted to the revelations which he has given  to us, for a correct understanding of his character, perfections, and  attributes; because, without the revelations which he has given to  us, no man by searching could find out God. Job 11:7,8,9. First Cor.  2:9,10,11: But as it is written, eye has not seen, nor ear heard,  neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath  prepared for them that love him; but God hath revealed them unto us by  his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things  of God. For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man  which is in him? Even so, the things of God knows no man but by the  Spirit of God.    8. Having said so much, we proceed to examine the character which the  revelations have given of God.    9. Moses gives us the following account in Exodus, 34:6 And the Lord  passed by before him, and proclaimed, 'The Lord God, the Lord God,  merciful and gracious, long suffering and abundant in goodness and  truth. Psalm 103:6,7,8 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment  for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts  unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow  to anger and plenteous in mercy: Psalm 103:17,18: But the mercy of  the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,  and his righteousness unto children's children, to such as keep his  covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. Psalm  90:2: Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed  the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are  God. Heb. 1:10,11,12 And you, Lord, in the beginning, have laid the  foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:  they shall perish, but you remain; and they shall wax old as a garment;  and as a vesture shall you fold them up, and they shall be changed;  but you are the same and your years shall not fail James 1:17: Every  good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down from  the Father of lights; with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of  turning. Malachi 3:6. For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye  sons of Jacob are not consumed.    10. Book of Commandments, chpt. 2nd, commencing in the third line of  the first paragraph: For God does not walk in crooked paths, neither  does he turn to the right hand or the left, or vary from that which he  has said, therefore his paths are strait, and his course is one eternal  round: Book of Commandments, chapt. 37:1. Listen to the voice of the  Lord your God, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, whose  course is one eternal round, the same yesterday to-day and forever.    11. Numbers, 23:19. God is not a man, that he should lie, neither the  son of man that he should repent. First John, 4:8. He that loves not,  knows not God; for God is love. Acts 10:34: Then Peter opened his mouth  and said Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but  in every nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted  with him.    12. From the foregoing testimonies, we learn the following things  respecting the character of God.    13. First, That he was God before the world was created, and the same  God that he was, after it was created.    14. Secondly, That he is merciful, and gracious, slow to anger,  abundant in goodness, and that he was so from everlasting, and will be  to everlasting.    15. Thirdly, That he changes not, neither is there variableness with  him; but that he is the same from everlasting to everlasting, being the  same yesterday to-day and forever; and that his course is one eternal  round, without variation.    16. Fourthly, That he is a God of truth and cannot lie.    17. Fifthly, That he is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he  that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him.    18. Sixthly, That he is love.    19. An acquaintance with these attributes in the divine character,  is essentially necessary, in order that the faith of any rational  being can center in him for life and salvation. For if he did not, in  the first instance, believe him to be God, that is, the Creator and  upholder of all things, he could not _center_ his faith in him for life  and salvation, for fear there should be greater than he, who would  thwart all his plans, and he, like the gods of the heathen, would be  unable to fulfill his promises; but seeing he is God over all, from  everlasting to everlasting, the Creator and upholder of all things, no  such fear can exist in the minds of those who put their trust in him,  so that in this respect their faith can be without wavering.    20. But secondly: unless he was merciful and gracious, slow to anger,  long-suffering and full of goodness, such is the weakness of human  nature, and so great the frailties and imperfections of men, that  unless they believed that these excellencies existed in the divine  character, the faith necessary to salvation could not exist; for doubt  would take the place of faith, and those who know their weakness and  liability to sin would be in constant doubt of salvation if it were  not for the idea which they have of the excellency of the character of  God, that he is slow to anger and long-suffering, and of a forgiving  disposition, and does forgive iniquity, transgression, and sin. An idea  of these facts does away doubt, and makes faith exceedingly strong.    21. But it is equally as necessary that men should have the idea that  he is a God who changes not, in order to have faith in him, as it is  to have the idea that he is gracious and long-suffering. For without  the idea of unchangeableness in the character of the Deity, doubt  would take the place of faith. But with the idea that he changes not,  faith lays hold upon the excellencies in his character with unshaken  confidence, believing he is the same yesterday, to-day and forever, and  that his course is one eternal round.    22. And again, the idea that he is a God of truth and cannot lie, is  equally as necessary to the exercise of faith in him, as the idea of  his unchangeableness. For without the idea that he was a God of truth  and could not lie, the confidence necessary to be placed in his word in  order to the exercise of faith in him, could not exist. But having the  idea that he is not man that he can lie, it gives power to the minds of  men to exercise faith in him.    23. But it is also necessary that men should have an idea that he is no  respecter of persons; for with the idea of all the other excellencies  in his character, and this one wanting, men could not exercise faith  in him, because if he were a respecter of persons, they could not  tell what their privileges were, nor how far they were authorized to  exercise faith in him or whether they were authorized to do it at all,  but all must be confusion; but no sooner are the minds of men made  acquainted with the truth on this point, that he is no respecter of  persons, than they see that they have authority by faith to lay hold on  eternal life the richest boon of heaven, because God is no respecter of  persons, and that every man in every nation has an equal privilege.    24. And lastly, but not less important to the exercise of faith in God,  is the idea that he is love; for with all the other excellencies in his  character, without this one to influence them, they could not have such  powerful dominion over the minds of men; but when the idea is planted  in the mind that he is love, who cannot see the just ground that men of  every nation, kindred, and tongue, have to exercise faith in God so as  to obtain eternal life?    25. From the above description of the character of the Deity which is  given him in the revelations to men, there is a sure foundation for the  exercise of faith in him among every people, nation and kindred, from  age to age, and from generation to generation.    26. Let us here observe that the foregoing is the character which is  given of God in his revelations to the Former Day Saints, and it is  also the character which is given of him in his revelations to the  Latter Day Saints, so that the saints of former days, and those of  latter days, are both alike in this respect; the \"Latter Day Saints\"  having as good grounds to exercise faith in God, as the former day  saints had; because the same character is given of him to both.    Q. What was shown in the second lecture?    A. It was shown how the knowledge of the existence of God came into the  world--[§ III. ¶ 1.]    Q. What is the effect of the idea of his existence among men?    A. It lays the foundation for the exercise of faith in him.--[§ III. ¶  1.]    Q. Is the idea of his existence, in the first instance, necessary in  order for the exercise of faith in him?    A. It is. [§ III. ¶ 1.]    Q. How do you prove it?    A. By the tenth chapter of Romans and fourteenth verse. [§ III. ¶ 1.]    Q. How many things are necessary for us to understand, respecting the  Deity and our relation to him, in order that we may exercise faith in  him for life and salvation?    A. Three. [§ III. ¶ 2.]    Q. What are they?    A. First, that God does actually exist; secondly, correct ideas of his  character, his perfections and attributes; and thirdly, that the course  which we pursue is according to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#7)"],[1,"constitution, would generally  be best also in an absolute monarchy, only an absolute monarchy is not  so likely to practice it. The laws of property, for example; the  principles of evidence and judicial procedure; the system of taxation  and of financial administration, need not necessarily be different in  different forms of government. Each of these matters has principles  and rules of its own, which are a subject of separate study. General  jurisprudence, civil and penal legislation, financial and commercial  policy, are sciences in themselves, or, rather, separate members of  the comprehensive science or art of government; and the most  enlightened doctrines on all these subjects, though not equally likely  to be understood and acted on under all forms of government, yet, if  understood and acted on, would in general be equally beneficial under  them all. It is true that these doctrines could not be applied without  some modifications to all states of society and of the human mind;  nevertheless, by far the greater number of them would require  modifications solely of detail to adapt them to any state of society  sufficiently advanced to possess rulers capable of understanding them.  A government to which they would be wholly unsuitable must be one so  bad in itself, or so opposed to public feeling, as to be unable to  maintain itself in existence by honest means.    It is otherwise with that portion of the interests of the community  which relate to the better or worse training of the people themselves.  Considered as instrumental to this, institutions need to be radically  different, according to the stage of advancement already reached. The  recognition of this truth, though for the most part empirically rather  than philosophically, may be regarded as the main point of superiority  in the political theories of the present above those of the last age,  in which it was customary to claim representative democracy for  England or France by arguments which would equally have proved it the  only fit form of government for Bedouins or Malays. The state of  different communities, in point of culture and development, ranges  downwards to a condition very little above the highest of the beasts.  The upward range, too, is considerable, and the future possible  extension vastly greater. A community can only be developed out of one  of these states into a higher by a concourse of influences, among the  principal of which is the government to which they are subject. In all  states of human improvement ever yet attained, the nature and degree  of authority exercised over individuals, the distribution of power,  and the conditions of command and obedience, are the most powerful of  the influences, except their religious belief, which make them what  they are, and enable them to become what they can be. They may be  stopped short at any point in their progress by defective adaptation  of their government to that particular stage of advancement. And the  one indispensable merit of a government, in favor of which it may be  forgiven almost any amount of other demerit compatible with progress,  is that its operation on the people is favorable, or not unfavorable,  to the next step which it is necessary for them to take in order to  raise themselves to a higher level.    Thus (to repeat a former example), a people in a state of savage  independence, in which every one lives for himself, exempt, unless by  fits, from any external control, is practically incapable of making  any progress in civilization until it has learned to obey. The  indispensable virtue, therefore, in a government which establishes  itself over a people of this sort is that it make itself obeyed. To  enable it to do this, the constitution of the government must be  nearly, or quite despotic. A constitution in any degree popular,  dependent on the voluntary surrender by the different members of the  community of their individual freedom of action, would fail to enforce  the first lesson which the pupils, in this stage of their progress,  require. Accordingly, the civilization of such tribes, when not the  result of juxtaposition with others already civilized, is almost  always the work of an absolute ruler, deriving his power either from  religion or military prowess--very often from foreign arms.    Again, uncivilized races, and the bravest and most energetic still  more than the rest, are averse to continuous labor of an unexciting  kind. Yet all real civilization is at this price; without such labor,  neither can the mind be disciplined into the habits required by  civilized society, nor the material world prepared to receive it.  There needs a rare concurrence of circumstances, and for that reason  often a vast length of time, to reconcile such a people to industry,  unless they are for a while compelled to it. Hence even personal  slavery, by giving a commencement to industrial life, and enforcing it  as the exclusive occupation of the most numerous portion of the  community, may accelerate the transition to a better freedom than that  of fighting and rapine. It is almost needless to say that this excuse  for slavery is only available in a very early state of society. A  civilized people have far other means of imparting civilization to  those under their influence; and slavery is, in all its details, so  repugnant to that government of law, which is the foundation of all  modern life, and so corrupting to the master-class when they have once  come under civilized influences, that its adoption under any  circumstances whatever in modern society is a relapse into worse than  barbarism.    At some period, however, of their history, almost every people, now  civilized, have consisted, in majority, of slaves. A people in that  condition require to raise them out of it a very different polity from  a nation of savages. If they are energetic by nature, and especially  if there be associated with them in the same community an industrious  class who are neither slaves nor slave-owners (as was the case in  Greece), they need, probably, no more to insure their improvement than  to make them free: when freed, they may often be fit, like Roman  freedmen, to be admitted at once to the full rights of citizenship.  This, however, is not the normal condition of slavery, and is  generally a sign that it is becoming obsolete. A slave, properly so  called, is a being who has not learned to help himself. He is, no  doubt, one step in advance of a savage. He has not the first lesson of  political society still to acquire. He has learned to obey. But what  he obeys is only a direct command. It is the characteristic of _born_  slaves to be incapable of conforming their conduct to a rule or law.  They can only do what they are ordered, and only when they are ordered  to do it. If a man whom they fear is standing over them and  threatening them with punishment, they obey; but when his back is  turned, the work remains undone. The motive determining them must  appeal, not to their interests, but to their instincts; immediate hope  or immediate terror. A despotism, which may tame the savage, will, in  so far as it is a despotism, only confirm the slaves in their  incapacities. Yet a government under their own control would be  entirely unmanageable by them. Their improvement can not come from  themselves, but must be superinduced from without. The step which they  have to take, and their only path to improvement, is to be raised from  a government of will to one of law. They have to be taught  self-government, and this, in its initial stage, means the capacity to  act on general instructions. What they require is not a government of  force, but one of guidance. Being, however, in too low a state to  yield to the guidance of any but those to whom they look up as the  possessors of force, the sort of government fittest for them is one  which possesses force, but seldom uses it; a parental despotism or  aristocracy, resembling the St. Simonian form of Socialism;  maintaining a general superintendence over all the operations of  society, so as to keep before each the sense of a present force  sufficient to compel his obedience to the rule laid down, but which,  owing to the impossibility of descending to regulate all the minutiae  of industry and life, necessarily leaves and induces individuals to do  much of themselves. This, which may be termed the government of  leading-strings, seems to be the one required to carry such a people  the most rapidly through the next necessary step in social progress.  Such appears to have been the idea of the government of the Incas of  Peru, and such was that of the Jesuits of Paraguay. I need scarcely  remark that leading-strings are only admissible as a means of  gradually training the people to walk alone.    It would be out of place to carry the illustration further. To attempt  to investigate what kind of government is suited to every known state  of society would be to compose a treatise, not on representative  government, but on political science at large. For our more limited  purpose we borrow from political philosophy only its general  principles. To determine the form of government most suited to any  particular people, we must be able, among the defects and shortcomings  which belong to that people, to distinguish those that are the  immediate impediment to progress--to discover what it is which (as it  were) stops the way. The best government for them is the one which  tends most to give them that for want of which they can not advance,  or advance only in a lame and lopsided manner. We must not, however,  forget the reservation necessary in all things which have for their  object improvement or Progress, namely, that in seeking the good which  is needed, no damage, or as little as possible, be done to that  already possessed. A people of savages should be taught obedience, but  not in such a manner as to convert them into a"]]]
