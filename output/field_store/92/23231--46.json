O ye best of Brahmanas, arithmeticians  have calculated that the number of chariots in an Akshauhini is twenty-one  thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure of elephants must be fixed  at the same number. O ye pure, you must know that the number of foot-  soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three hundred and fifty, the  number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six hundred and ten. These, O  Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the numbers of an Akshauhini as  said by those acquainted with the principles of numbers. O best of  Brahmanas, according to this calculation were composed the eighteen  Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army. Time, whose acts are  wonderful assembled them on that spot and having made the Kauravas the  cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with choice of weapons,  fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava Vahinis for five days.  Karna the desolator of hostile armies fought for two days; and Salya for  half a day. After that lasted for half a day the encounter with clubs  between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that day, Aswatthaman and  Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night while sleeping  without suspicion of danger.    \"O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be  repeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of  Janamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into several  sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika parvas,  describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work whose  description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It contains an  account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the wise, as the  state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release. As Self among  things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so is this history  that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of Brahma the first  among all the sastras. There is not a story current in this world but doth  depend upon this history even as the body upon the foot that it taketh. As  masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by servants desirous of  preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets. As the words  constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining to the world  and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this excellent history  displayeth only the highest wisdom.    \"Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas)  of this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and  feet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical  connections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.    \"The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then  Paushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana.

They thought the crust of the earth was too hard to be  broken up for seed, even if they knew what grain and bread were. They  supposed that what nature provided in the forest was the only food for  men. Besides this, they made their women do all the work and cook the  acorns and brew the honey into mead, while they went out to fish and  hunt and fight.    So the fairies took pity on the cold, northern people, who lived where  it rained and snowed a great deal. They held a council and agreed that  it was time to send down to the earth an animal, with tusks, to tear up  the ground. Then the people would see the riches of the earth and learn  what soil was. They would be blessed with farms and gardens, barns and  stalls, hay and grain, horses and cattle, wheat and barley, pigs and  clover.    Now there were powerful fairies, of a certain kind, who lived in a Happy  Land far, far away, who had charge of everything in the air and water.  One of them was named Fro, who became lord of the summer sunshine and  warm showers, that make all things grow. It was in this bright region  that the white elves lived.    It was a pretty custom in fairy-land that when a fairy baby cut its  first tooth, the mother's friends should make the little one some pretty  present.    When Nerthus, the mother of the infant Fro, looked into its mouth and  saw the little white thing that had come up through the baby's gums, she  went in great glee and told the glad news to all the other fairies. It  was a great event and she tried to guess what present her wonderful  boy-baby should receive.    There was one giant-like fairy as strong as a polar bear, who agreed to  get, for little Fro, a creature that could put his nose under the sod  and root up the ground. In this way he would show men what the earth,  just under its surface, contained, without their going into mines and  caverns.    One day this giant fairy heard two stout dwarfs talking loudly in the  region under the earth. They were boasting as to which could beat the  other at the fire and bellows, for both were blacksmiths. One was the  king of the dwarfs, who made a bet that he could excel the other. So he  set them to work as rivals, while a third dwarf worked the bellows. The  dwarf-king threw some gold in the flames to melt; but, fearing he might  not win the bet, he went away to get other fairies to help him. He told  the bellows dwarf to keep on pumping air on the fire, no matter what  might happen to him.    So when one giant fairy, in the form of a gadfly, flew at him, and bit  him in the hand, the bellows-blower did not stop for the pain, but kept  on until the fire roared loudly, as to make the cavern echo. Then all  the gold melted and could be transformed. As soon as the dwarf-king came  back, the bellows-blower took up the tongs and drew out of the fire a  boar having golden bristles.    This fire-born golden boar had the power of travelling through the air  as swiftly as a streak of lightning. It was named Gullin, or Golden, and  was given to the fairy Fro, and he, when grown, used the wonderful  creature as his steed. All the other good fairies and the elves  rejoiced, because men on the earth would now be helped to do great  things.    Even more wonderful to tell, this fire-born creature became the father  of all the animals that have tusks and that roam in the woods. A tusk is  a big tooth, of which the hardest and sharpest part grows, long and  sharp, outside of the mouth and it stays there, even when the mouth is  shut.    When Gullin was not occupied, or being ridden by Fro on his errands over  the world, he taught his sons, that is, the wild boars of the forest,  how to root up the ground and make it soft for things to grow in. Then  his master Fro sent the sunbeams and the warm showers to make the  turned-up earth fruitful.    To do this, the wild boars were given two long tusks, as pointed as  needles and sharp as knives. With one sweep of his head a boar could rip  open a dog or a wolf, a bull or a bear, or furrow the earth like a  ploughshare.    Now there were several cousins in the Tusk family. The elephant on land,  and the walrus and narwhal in the seas; but none of these could plough  ground, but because the boar's tusks grew out so long and were so sharp,  and hooked at the end, it could tear open the earth's hard crust and  root up the ground. This made a soil fit for tender plants to grow in,  and even the wild flowers sprang up in them.    All this, when they first noticed it, was very wonderful to human  beings. The children called one to the other to come and see the unusual  sight. The little troughs, made first by the ripping of the boar's  tusks, were widened by rooting with their snouts. These were welcomed by  the birds, for they hopped into the lines thus made, to feed on the  worms. So the birds, supposing that these little gutters in the ground  were made especially for them, made great friends with the boars. They  would even perch near by, or fly to their backs, and ride on them.    As for the men fathers, when they looked at the clods and the loose  earth thus turned over, they found them to be very soft. So the women  and girls were able to break them up with their sticks. Then the seeds,  dropped by the birds that came flying back every spring time, from  far-away lands, sprouted. It was noticed that new kinds of plants grew  up, which had stalks. In the heads or ears of these were a hundredfold  more seeds. When the children tasted them, they found, to their delight,  that the little grains were good to eat. They swallowed them whole, they  roasted them at the fire, or they pounded them with stones. Then they  baked the meal thus made or made it into mush, eating it with honey.    For the first time people in the Dutch world had bread. When they added  the honey, brought by the bees, they had sweet cakes with mead. Then,  saving the seeds over, from one summer to another, they in the spring  time planted them in the little trenches made by the animal's tusks.  Then the Dutch words for \"boar\" and \"row\" were put together, meaning  boar row, and there issued, in time, our word \"furrow.\"    The women were the first to become skilful in baking. In the beginning  they used hot stones on which to lay the lump of meal, or flour and  water, or the batter. Then having learned about yeast, which \"raised\"  the flour, that is, lifted it up, with gas and bubbles, they made real  bread and cakes and baked them in the ovens which the men had made. When  they put a slice of meat between upper and lower layers of bread, they  called it \"broodje,\" that is, little bread; or, sandwich. In time,  instead of one kind of bread, or cake, they had a dozen or twenty  different sorts, besides griddle cakes and waffles.    Now when the wise men of the mark, or neighborhood, saw that the women  did such wonderful things, they put their heads together and said one to  the other:    \"We are quite ready to confess that fairies, and elves, and even the  kabouters are smarter than we are. Our women, also, are certainly  wonderful; but it will never do to let the boars think that they know  more than we do. They did indeed teach us how to make furrows, and the  birds brought us grain; but we are the greater, for we can hunt and kill  the boars with our spears.    \"Although they can tear up the sod and root in the ground with tusk and  snout, they cannot make cakes, as our women can. So let us see if we  cannot beat both the boars and birds, and even excel our women. We shall  be more like the fairies, if we invent something that will outshine them  all.\"    So they thought and planned, and, little by little, they made the  plough. First, with a sharp stick in their hands, the men scratched the  surface of the ground into lines that were not very deep. Then they  nailed plates of iron on those sticks. Next, they fixed this iron-shod  wood in a frame to be pulled forward, and, by and by, they added  handles. Men and women, harnessed together, pulled the plough. Indeed it  was ages before they had oxen to do this heavy work for them. At last  the perfect plough was seen. It had a knife in front to cut the clods, a  coulter, a beam, a mould board and handles, and, after a while, a wheel  to keep it straight. Then they set horses to draw it.    Fro the fairy was the owner, not only of the boar with the golden  bristles, but also of the lightning-like horse, Sleipnir, that could  ride through fire and water with the speed of light. Fro also owned the  magic ship, which could navigate both land and sea. It was so very  elastic that it could be stretched out to carry a host of warriors over  the seas to war, or fold up like a lady's handkerchief. With this flying  vessel, Fro was able to move about like a cloud and also to change like  them. He could also appear, or disappear, as he pleased, in one place or  another.    By and by, the wild boars were all hunted to death and disappeared. Yet  in one way, and a glorious one also, their name and fame were kept in  men's memories. Brave knights had the boar's head painted on their  shields and coats of arms. When the faith of the Prince of Peace made  wars less frequent, the temples in honor of Fro were deserted, but the  yule log and the revels, held to celebrate the passing of the Mother  Night, in December, that is, the longest one of the year, were changed  for the Christmas festival.    Then again, the memory of man's teacher of the plough was still kept  green; for the boar was remembered as the giver, not only of nourishing  meat, but of ideas for men's brains. Baked in the oven, and made  delightful to the appetite, served on the dish, with its own savory  odors; withal, decorated with sprigs of rosemary, the boar's head was  brought in for the great dinner, with the singing of Christmas carols.
