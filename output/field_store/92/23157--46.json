The \"drawer\" is the one who makes the check.    The \"payee\" is the one for whom the check is made.    In making a check, the best plan is to fill out the stub first,  and from the data on it make out the check. This tends to  accuracy.    Be sure to number your check, beginning with I.    Be sure that the number on the stub is the same as on the check.    A person having money in bank and wishing to draw for his own use,  makes his check payable to \"self\" or to \"cash.\"    Usual form of check:               First National Bank.   No. 27              Kingston, Vt., Oct. 13, 1910.        Pay to order of John Smith        Seventy-five 75/100  ------ dollars.        $75.75               George F. Brown.    It is proper form to specify on the face of the check the purpose  for which it is given, but while this is permissible it is not  usual.    Write the amount of the check first in words then in figures. This  makes more certain the amount.    Always begin first word of amount close to left-hand side of  check; when the whole sum is written down draw a heavy stroke  along the line to the word \"dollars.\"    When a check is made payable to John Smith or order, John Smith  must sign his name on the back of the check--left-hand end and  about an inch from the top.    Never sign a check until you are ready to collect, or to bank it.    The payee can endorse the check to another by writing on the back  as follows:          Pay to the order of                 Thomas Brown.                              John Smith.    A check payable to \"bearer\" may be negotiated by any one. When  such checks are presented by a stranger, at the bank of the maker,  the paying teller always insists that the stranger be identified.    Never make a check payable to \"bearer\" if it can be avoided.    Sometimes checks are dated ahead, for reasons satisfactory to the  maker and payee.    A check drawn on August 5th, but dated August 20th cannot be  collected till the latter date.    Never date a check ahead unless you are positive that you will  have the money in bank to meet it on the day named.    Never, if you can avoid it in trade, receive a post-dated check.    Cash or deposit your checks as soon as possible after they are  received.    If the bank should fail, while you are holding the check, the  maker cannot be held for the loss.    CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT    Often when a depositor is travelling, he finds it convenient to  carry with him a form of paper that is as good as cash, and much  better in the event of loss.    Banks will issue \"certified checks\" to depositors. These checks  are stamped by the bank \"certified\" with the date and officer's  signature attached.    On issuing such a check, the bank debits the receiver's account  with the amount, and so can guarantee the payment whenever or  wherever presented.    Such a check may be received with as much certainty of its value  as if it were a bank bill.    When a person places money in a bank with no intention of checking  it out for some time to come, he may have issued to him a  \"Certificate of deposit.\"    While holding this certificate he cannot check against the money  in the bank.    The holder of a certificate of deposit may transfer it.    The money may be paid in part by the bank, if the certificate is  presented, and the amount is endorsed on the back.    To withdraw all the money the certificate must be surrendered.    USE OF CHECKS    There is no form of commercial paper in such general use as the  check.    The total of all the checks in use at some seasons is far more  than the total of all the money in all the banks.    Checks are balanced in the money centers through what are known as  clearing houses. In these a bank is charged with checks against it  and credited with those in its favor.    The differences are settled by cash.    Often a few thousand dollars will settle check accounts amounting  to millions.    If by any chance you should receive a check in which your name is  misspelled, or not given as you write it, endorse the check  exactly as the name is written on the face, then add your name in  the regular way.          CHAPTER IX    SAVINGS BANKS        While of National importance, savings banks are chartered by the  respective states in which they exist, and as such are distinctly  local institutions.    Unlike the National, the savings bank is not established as a  money-making corporation.    The ostensible and actual purpose of the savings bank is to  encourage people of small means to save.    The savings bank provides a safe place for the care of such  deposits, and it pays such rates of interest on such deposits as  are warranted by the earnings of its investments after paying the  expenses incident to the proper conduct of its officers.    When a savings bank receives authorization to act, through a  charter from the state, the organizers choose a board of directors  and the proper officers.    Usually the officers occupying positions of trust and  responsibility are required to give bonds for the proper discharge  of their duties.    HOW BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED    With all the legal conditions complied with, and a suitable office  provided, the savings bank is ready for business.    Some savings banks will receive on deposit any sum from five cents  to five thousand dollars.    Other banks will not receive less than one dollar at a time, nor  more than a thousand.    We have heard of \"penny savings banks,\" but they are rarely  chartered, and are organized, only to encourage thrift among  children.    Fractional parts of a dollar are not usually reckoned as drawing  interest.    Some banks require as much as three, four or five dollars before  allowing interest.    Savings banks in the eastern states pay from three to four per  cent. In the west it is sometimes as high as six.    Each bank has certain dates at which calculation of interest  begins. As a rule this is January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and  October 1st.    Money deposited at any time between these dates does not draw  interest till the beginning of the next quarter.    But never mind the interest.    The best time to make a deposit is when you have the money.    The bank is safer than your pocket.    HOW TO DEPOSIT    Count your money carefully and make a memorandum of the amount  before giving to the savings bank to deposit.    Hand the money to the officer--usually \"the receiving teller\"--  authorized to receive it.    The teller writes down the name, age, occupation and residence of  the depositor.    If money is deposited in the name of one under legal age, the  names of the parents and the birthplace of the minor are also  recorded.    The adult depositor must write his name in a book provided by the  bank for the signature of clients.    When these conditions are complied with, the depositor receives a  memorandum book, known as a \"deposit book\", in which, with his  name and date, is written the amount of his first deposit.    The deposit book must be carefully guarded, for without its  presentation at the savings bank money cannot be drawn. You cannot  check against your savings bank account, as with a commercial  bank.    HOW THE ACCOUNT GROWS    After the first account is opened the rest is easy.    On the second, as on all subsequent visits, the deposit book, with  the amount to be entered, is handed to the receiving teller. He  counts the money, makes a record of it for his own use, enters it  on your book as a deposit, and hands the book back. That is all.    Whenever interest is due it is written down in the book as if it  were a cash deposit.    The interest, if desired, will be paid in cash, but if allowed to  remain, it begins at once to earn interest for itself.    Interest grows like a rolling snow ball. On such small beginnings  great fortunes have been built.    Savings banks keep a reserve, made up of earnings in excess of  interest and all expenses.    This reserve earns money.    The money so earned is reckoned as a net profit, and it may be  distributed, and usually is, among its depositors as a \"dividend.\"    THE LIMIT OF DEPOSIT    Different banks have different limits of deposit, that is fixed  sums beyond which they will not receive.    The limit is from one thousand to five thousand dollars.    When the fortunate depositor has reached the limit with one  savings bank, there is no law to prevent his opening another  account with another, or with any number of similar banks.    Remember the savings banks are not meant for capitalists, but for  small depositors.    After deposits and interests have reached a total of $1,600, the  interest will not go on earning interest, but will be regarded  simply as a deposit.    This is in compliance with law.    Depositors, posted as to the law, open another account with  another bank, and keep on till the interest limit is reached.    HOW TO DRAW MONEY    A savings bank depositor may either draw money himself or through  some properly authorized person.    This is the method:    The deposit book is presented to the paying teller. The owner  states the sum he wants to draw.    Having assured himself that the bearer of the book is the right  person, the teller takes a receipt in a book kept for the purpose,  for the amount, enters the same on the right hand or debit side of  the book, and hands out the money.    There is a form of authorization for another to draw, printed on  the deposit book. This must be copied and its directions complied  with.    Most banks will not allow depositors to draw out less than a fixed  sum, say $5.00.    This saves trouble, and prevents thoughtless depositors from going  to the bank every time they want a dollar.    Before a depositor can draw a large sum from a savings bank he may  be compelled, under the law, to give from one week to six weeks'  notice of his intention.

All flew to the flowers in the queen's right hand. Not one of  the bees so much as looked at those in her left hand.    \"O Queen of Sheba, the bees have given you my answer,\" then said  Solomon.    And the queen said, \"You are wise, King Solomon. You gather knowledge  from the little things which common men pass by unnoticed.\"    King Solomon lived three thousand years ago. He built a great temple  in Jerusalem, and was famous for his wisdom.          OUR FIRST GREAT PAINTER        A long time ago there lived, in Pennsylvania, a little boy whose name  was Benjamin West.    This boy loved pictures. Indeed, there were few things that he loved  more. But he had never seen any pictures except a few small ones in  a book. His father and mother were Quakers, and they did not think it  was right to spend money for such things. They thought that pictures  might take one's mind away from things that were better or more useful.    One day Benjamin's mother had to go to a neighbor's on some errand.  So she told Benjamin to stay in the house and take care of his baby  sister till she came back.    He was glad to do this; for he loved the baby.    \"Yes, mother,\" he said, \"I will watch her every minute. I won't let  anything hurt her.\"    The baby was asleep in her cradle, and he must not make a noise and  waken her. For some time he sat very still. He heard the clock ticking.  He heard the birds singing. He began to feel a little lonesome.    A fly lighted on the baby's cheek, and he brushed it away. Then he  thought what a pretty picture might be made of his sister's sweet face  and little hands.    He had no paper, but he knew where there was a smooth board. He had  no pencil, but there was a piece of black charcoal on the hearth. How  pretty the baby was! He began to draw. The baby smiled but did not  wake up.    [Illustration]    As often as he touched the charcoal to the smooth board, the picture  grew. Here was her round head, covered with pretty curls. Here was her  mouth. Here were her eyes, and here her dainty ears. Here was her fat  little neck. Here were her wonderful hands.    So busy was he with the drawing that he did not think of anything else.  He heard neither the clock nor the birds. He did not even hear his  mother's footsteps as she came into the room. He did not hear her soft  breathing as she stood over him and watched him finish the wonderful  drawing. \"O Benjamin! what has thee been doing?\" she cried.    The lad sprang up alarmed.    \"It's only a picture of the baby, mother,\" he said.    \"A picture of the baby! Oh, wonderful! It looks just like her!\"    The good woman was so overjoyed that she caught him in her arms and  kissed him. Then suddenly she began to wonder whether this was right.    \"Benjamin, how did thee learn to draw such a picture?\" she asked.    \"I didn't learn,\" he answered. \"I just did it. I couldn't help but do  it.\"    When Benjamin's father came home, his mother showed him the picture.  \"It looks just like her, doesn't it?\" she said. \"But I am afraid. I  don't know what to think. Does thee suppose that it is very wrong for  Benjamin to do such a thing?\"    The father did not answer. He turned the picture this way and that,  and looked at it from every side. He compared it with the baby's pretty  face. Then he handed it back to his wife and said:--    \"Put it away. It may be that the hand of the Lord is in this.\"    Several weeks afterward, there came a visitor to the home of the Wests.  It was a good old Friend, whom everybody loved--a-white-haired,  pleasant-faced minister, whose words were always wise.    Benjamin's parents showed him the picture. They told him how the lad  was always trying to draw something. And they asked what they should  do about it.    The good minister looked at the picture for a long time. Then he called  little Benjamin to him. He put his hands on the lad's head and said:--    \"This child has a wonderful gift. We cannot understand it nor the  reason of it. Let us trust that great good may come from it, and that  Benjamin West may grow up to be an honor to our country and the world.\"    And the words of the old minister came true. The pictures of Benjamin  West made him famous. He was the first great American painter.          THE YOUNG SCOUT        When Andrew Jackson was a little boy he lived with his mother in South  Carolina. He was eight years old when he heard about the ride of Paul  Revere and the famous fight at Lexington.    It was then that the long war, called the Revolutionary War, began.  The king's soldiers were sent into every part of the country. The  people called them the British. Some called them \"red-coats.\"    There was much fighting; and several great battles took place between  the British and the Americans.    At last Charleston, in South Carolina, was taken by the British. Andrew  Jackson was then a tall white-haired boy, thirteen years old.    \"I am going to help drive those red-coated British out of the country,\"  he said to his mother.    Then, without another word, he mounted his brother's little farm horse  and rode away. He was not old enough to be a soldier, but he could be  a scout--and a good scout he was.    He was very tall--as tall as a man. He was not afraid of anything. He  was strong and ready for every duty.    One day as he was riding through the woods, some British soldiers saw  him. They quickly surrounded him and made him their prisoner.    \"Come with us,\" they said, \"and we will teach you that the king's  soldiers are not to be trifled with.\"    They took him to the British camp.    \"What is your name, young rebel?\" said the British captain.    \"Andy Jackson.\"    \"Well, Andy Jackson, get down here and clean the mud from my boots.\"    Andrew's gray eyes blazed as he stood up straight and proud before the  haughty captain.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"I am a prisoner of war, and demand to be treated as  such.\"    \"You rebel!\" shouted the captain. \"Down with you, and clean those boots  at once.\"    The slim, tall boy seemed to grow taller, as he answered, \"I'll not  be the servant of any Englishman that ever lived.\"    [Illustration]    The captain was very angry. He drew his sword to hit the boy with its  flat side. Andrew threw out his hand and received an ugly gash across  the knuckles.    Some other officers, who had seen the whole affair, cried out to the  captain, \"Shame! He is a brave boy. He deserves to be treated as a  gentleman.\"    Andrew was not held long as a prisoner. The British soldiers soon  returned to Charleston, and he was allowed to go home.    In time, Andrew Jackson became a very great man. He was elected to  Congress, he was chosen judge of the supreme court of Tennessee, he  was appointed general in the army, and lastly he was for eight years  the president of the United States.          THE LAD WHO RODE SIDESADDLE        When Daniel Webster was a child he lived in the country, far from any  city. He was not strong enough to work on the farm like his brothers;  but he loved books and study.    He was very young when he was first sent to school. The schoolhouse  was two or three miles from home, but he did not mind the long walk  through the woods and over the hills.    He soon learned all that his teacher could teach; for he was bright  and quick, and had a good memory.    His father hoped that Daniel would grow up to be a wise and famous  man. \"But,\" said he, \"no man can rightly succeed without an education.\"    So it was decided that the boy should go to some school where he might  be prepared for college.    One evening his father said to him, \"Daniel, you must be up early in  the morning. You are going to Exeter with me.\"    \"To Exeter, father!\" said Daniel.    \"Yes, to Exeter. I am going to put you in the academy there.\"    The academy at Exeter was a famous school for preparing boys for  college. It is still a famous school. But Daniel's father did not say  anything about college.    There were no railroads at that time, and Exeter was nearly fifty miles  away. Daniel and his father would ride there on horseback.    Early in the morning two horses were brought to the door. One was Mr.  Webster's horse; the other was an old gray nag with a lady's sidesaddle  on its back.    \"Who is going to ride that nag?\" asked Daniel.    \"Young Dan Webster,\" answered his father.    \"But I don't want a sidesaddle. I'm not a lady.\"    \"I understand,\" said Mr. Webster. \"But our neighbor, Johnson, is  sending the nag to Exeter for the use of a lady who is to ride back  with me. He does me a favor by allowing you to ride on the animal, and  I do him a favor by taking care of it.\"    \"But won't it look rather funny for me to ride to Exeter on a  sidesaddle?\"    \"Well, if a lady can ride on it, perhaps Dan Webster can do as much.\"    And so they set out on their journey to Exeter. Mr. Webster rode in  front, and Daniel, on the old gray nag, followed behind. The roads  were muddy, and they went slowly. It took them two days to reach  Exeter.    The people whom they met gazed at them and wondered who they could be.  They scarcely noticed the sidesaddle; they noticed only the boy's dark  eyes and his strong, noble face.    His clothes were of homemade stuff; his shoes were coarse and heavy;  he had no gloves on his hands; he was awkward and bashful.    Yet there was something in his manner and voice that caused everybody  to admire him.    Daniel Webster lived to become a famous orator and a great statesman.  He was honored at home and abroad.          THE WHISPERERS        \"Boys, what did I tell you?\"    The schoolmaster spoke angrily. He was in trouble because his scholars  would not study. Whenever his back was turned, they were sure to begin  whispering to one another.    \"Girls, stop your whispering, I say.\"    But still they would whisper, and he could not prevent it. The  afternoon was half gone, and the trouble was growing. Then the master  thought of a"]]]
