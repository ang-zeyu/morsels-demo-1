But the reason which leads many to persuade them selves that there is a  difficulty in knowing this truth, and even also in knowing what their  mind really is, is that they never raise their thoughts above sensible  objects, and are so accustomed to consider nothing except by way of  imagination, which is a mode of thinking limited to material objects,  that all that is not imaginable seems to them not intelligible.  The  truth of this is sufficiently manifest from the single circumstance,  that the philosophers of the schools accept as a maxim that there is  nothing in the understanding which was not previously in the senses, in  which however it is certain that the ideas of God and of the soul have  never been; and it appears to me that they who make use of their  imagination to comprehend these ideas do exactly the some thing as if,  in order to hear sounds or smell odors, they strove to avail themselves  of their eyes; unless indeed that there is this difference, that the  sense of sight does not afford us an inferior assurance to those of  smell or hearing; in place of which, neither our imagination nor our  senses can give us assurance of anything unless our understanding  intervene.    Finally, if there be still persons who are not sufficiently persuaded  of the existence of God and of the soul, by the reasons I have adduced,  I am desirous that they should know that all the other propositions, of  the truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured, as that  we have a body, and that there exist stars and an earth, and such like,  are less certain; for, although we have a moral assurance of these  things, which is so strong that there is an appearance of extravagance  in doubting of their existence, yet at the same time no one, unless his  intellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a  metaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude  entire assurance, in the observation that when asleep we can in the  same way imagine ourselves possessed of another body and that we see  other stars and another earth, when there is nothing of the kind.  For  how do we know that the thoughts which occur in dreaming are false  rather than those other which we experience when awake, since the  former are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter?  And  though men of the highest genius study this question as long as they  please, I do not believe that they will be able to give any reason  which can be sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose  the existence of God.  For, in the first place even the principle which  I have already taken as a rule, viz., that all the things which we  clearly and distinctly conceive are true, is certain only because God  is or exists and because he is a Perfect Being, and because all that we  possess is derived from him:  whence it follows that our ideas or  notions, which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness are  real, and proceed from God, must to that extent be true.  Accordingly,  whereas we not infrequently have ideas or notions in which some falsity  is contained, this can only be the case with such as are to some extent  confused and obscure, and in this proceed from nothing (participate of  negation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we are not wholly  perfect.  And it is evident that it is not less repugnant that falsity  or imperfection, in so far as it is imperfection, should proceed from  God, than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing.  But if  we did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds  from a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas  might be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance  that they possessed the perfection of being true.    But after the knowledge of God and of the soul has rendered us certain  of this rule, we can easily understand that the truth of the thoughts  we experience when awake, ought not in the slightest degree to be  called in question on account of the illusions of our dreams.  For if  it happened that an individual, even when asleep, had some very  distinct idea, as, for example, if a geometer should discover some new  demonstration, the circumstance of his being asleep would not militate  against its truth; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams,  which consists in their representing to us various objects in the same  way as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us  very properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense; for we are  not infrequently deceived in the same manner when awake; as when  persons in the jaundice see all objects yellow, or when the stars or  bodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are.  For, in fine, whether awake or asleep, we ought never to allow  ourselves to be persuaded of the truth of anything unless on the  evidence of our reason.  And it must be noted that I say of our reason,  and not of our imagination or of our senses:  thus, for example,  although we very clearly see the sun, we ought not therefore to  determine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight  presents; and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined  to the body of a goat, without being therefore shut up to the  conclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of reason  that what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent; but it plainly  tells us that all our ideas or notions contain in them some truth; for  otherwise it could not be that God, who is wholly perfect and  veracious, should have placed them in us.  And because our reasonings  are never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake,  although sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and  distinct, if not more so than in our waking moments, reason further  dictates that, since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our  partial imperfection, those possessing truth must infallibly be found  in the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our  dreams.        PART V    I would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of  truths which I deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it  would have been necessary now to treat of many questions in dispute  among the earned, with whom I do not wish to be embroiled, I believe  that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition, and only  mention in general what these truths are, that the more judicious may  be able to determine whether a more special account of them would  conduce to the public advantage.  I have ever remained firm in my  original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which I  have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of God and  of the soul, and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me  more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had  formerly appeared; and yet I venture to state that not only have I  found means to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal  difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy, but I have  also observed certain laws established in nature by God in such a  manner, and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions, that  after we have reflected sufficiently upon these, we cannot doubt that  they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the  world and farther, by considering the concatenation of these laws, it  appears to me that I have discovered many truths more useful and more  important than all I had before learned, or even had expected to learn.    But because I have essayed to expound the chief of these discoveries in  a treatise which certain considerations prevent me from publishing, I  cannot make the results known more conveniently than by here giving a  summary of the contents of this treatise.  It was my design to comprise  in it all that, before I set myself to write it, I thought I knew of  the nature of material objects.  But like the painters who, finding  themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the  different faces of a solid body, select one of the chief, on which  alone they make the light fall, and throwing the rest into the shade,  allow them to appear only in so far as they can be seen while looking  at the principal one; so, fearing lest I should not be able to compense  in my discourse all that was in my mind, I resolved to expound singly,  though at considerable length, my opinions regarding light; then to  take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed  stars, since light almost wholly proceeds from them; on the heavens  since they transmit it; on the planets, comets, and earth, since they  reflect it; and particularly on all the bodies that are upon the earth,  since they are either colored, or transparent, or luminous; and finally  on man, since he is the spectator of these objects.  Further, to enable  me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade, and to  express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom, without being  necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned, I resolved  to leave all the people here to their disputes, and to speak only of  what would happen in a new world, if God were now to create somewhere  in the imaginary spaces matter sufficient to compose one, and were to  agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so  that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned,  and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to  nature,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#7)"],[1,"their god.'  The strains of his heredity were very     curiously, but very clearly, mingled.  It may surprise some readers to     find him speaking of 'the family evil, despondency,' but he spoke with     knowledge.  He inherited from his father not only a stern Scottish     intentness on the moral aspect of life ('I would rise from the dead to     preach'), but a marked disposition to melancholy and hypochondria.     From his mother, on the other hand, he derived, along with his     physical frailty, a resolute and cheery stoicism.  These two elements     in his nature fought many a hard fight, and the besieging forces from     without--ill-health, poverty, and at one time family dissensions--were     by no means without allies in the inner citadel of his soul.  His     spirit was courageous in the truest sense of the word: by effort and     conviction, not by temperamental insensibility to fear.  It is clear     that there was a period in his life (and that before the worst of his     bodily ills came upon him) when he was often within measurable     distance of Carlylean gloom.  He was twenty-four when he wrote thus,     from Swanston, to Mrs Sitwell:       \"'It is warmer a bit; but my body is most decrepit, and I can just     manage to be cheery and tread down hypochondria under foot by work.  I     lead such a funny life, utterly without interest or pleasure outside     of my work: nothing, indeed, but work all day long, except a short     walk alone on the cold hills, and meals, and a couple of pipes with my     father in the evening.  It is surprising how it suits me, and how     happy I keep.'       \"This is the serenity which arises, not from the absence of fuliginous     elements in the character, but from a potent smoke-consuming faculty,     and an inflexible will to use it.  Nine years later he thus admonishes     his backsliding parent:       \"'MY DEAR MOTHER,--I give my father up.  I give him a parable: that     the Waverley novels are better reading for every day than the tragic     _Life_.  And he takes it back-side foremost, and shakes his head, and     is gloomier than ever.  Tell him that I give him up.  I don't want no     such a parent.  This is not the man for my money.  I do not call that     by the name of religion which fills a man with bile.  I write him a     whole letter, bidding him beware of extremes, and telling him that his     gloom is gallows-worthy; and I get back an answer--.  Perish the     thought of it.       \"'Here am I on the threshold of another year, when, according to all     human foresight, I should long ago have been resolved into my     elements: here am I, who you were persuaded was born to disgrace     you--and, I will do you the justice to add, on no such insufficient     grounds--no very burning discredit when all is done; here am I     married, and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of the first     order.  A1 at Lloyd's.  There is he, at his not first youth, able to     take more exercise than I at thirty-three, and gaining a stone's     weight, a thing of which I am incapable.  There are you; has the man     no gratitude? . . .       \"'Even the Shorter Catechism, not the merriest epitome of religion,     and a work exactly as pious although not quite so true as the     multiplication table--even that dry-as-dust epitome begins with a     heroic note.  What is man's chief end?  Let him study that; and ask     himself if to refuse to enjoy God's kindest gifts is in the spirit     indicated.'       \"As may be judged from this half-playful, half-serious remonstrance,     Stevenson's relation to his parents was eminently human and beautiful.     The family dissensions above alluded to belonged only to a short but     painful period, when the father could not reconcile himself to the     discovery that the son had ceased to accept the formulas of Scottish     Calvinism.  In the eyes of the older man such heterodoxy was for the     moment indistinguishable from atheism; but he soon arrived at a better     understanding of his son's position.  Nothing appears more     unmistakably in these letters than the ingrained theism of Stevenson's     way of thought.  The poet, the romancer within him, revolted from the     conception of formless force.  A personal deity was a necessary     character in the drama, as he conceived it.  And his morality, though     (or inasmuch as) it dwelt more on positive kindness than on negative     lawlessness, was, as he often insisted, very much akin to the morality     of the New Testament.\"    Anyway it is clear that much in the interminglings of blood we _can_  trace, may go to account for not a little in Stevenson.  His peculiar  interest in the enormities of old-time feuds, the excesses, the  jealousies, the queer psychological puzzles, the desire to work on the  outlying and morbid, and even the unallowed and unhallowed, for purposes  of romance--the delight in dealing with revelations of primitive feeling  and the out-bursts of the mere natural man always strangely checked and  diverted by the uprise of other tendencies to the dreamy, impalpable,  vague, weird and horrible.  There was the undoubted Celtic element in him  underlying what seemed foreign to it, the disregard of conventionality in  one phase, and the falling under it in another--the reaction and the  retreat from what had attracted and interested him, and then the return  upon it, as with added zest because of the retreat.  The confessed  Hedonist, enjoying life and boasting of it just a little, and yet the  Puritan in him, as it were, all the time eyeing himself as from some  loophole of retreat, and then commenting on his own behaviour as a  Hedonist and Bohemian.  This clearly was not what most struck Beerbohm  Tree, during the time he was in close contact with Stevenson, while  arranging the production of _Beau Austin_ at the Haymarket Theatre, for  he sees, or confesses to seeing, only one side, and that the most  assertive, and in a sense, unreal one:       \"Stevenson,\" says Mr Tree, \"always seemed to me an epicure in life.  He     was always intent on extracting the last drop of honey from every     flower that came in his way.  He was absorbed in the business of the     moment, however trivial.  As a companion, he was delightfully witty;     as a personality, as much a creature of romance as his own creations.\"    This is simple, and it looks sincere; but it does not touch 'tother side,  or hint at, not to say, solve the problem of Stevenson's personality.  Had  he been the mere Hedonist he could never have done the work he did.  Mr  Beerbohm Tree certainly did not there see far or all round.    Miss Simpson says:       \"Mr Henley recalls him to Edinburgh folk as he was and as the true     Stevenson would have wished to be known--a queer, inexplicable     creature, his Celtic blood showing like a vein of unknown metal in the     stolid, steady rock of his sure-founded Stevensonian pedigree.  His     cousin and model, 'Bob' Stevenson, the art critic, showed that this     foreign element came from the men who lit our guiding lights for     seamen, not from the gentle-blooded Balfours.       \"Mr Henley is right in saying that the gifted boy had not much humour.     When the joke was against himself he was very thin-skinned and had a     want of balance.  This made him feel his honest father's sensible     remarks like the sting of a whip.\"    Miss Simpson then proceeds to say:       \"The R. L. Stevenson of old Edinburgh days was a conceited,     egotistical youth, but a true and honest one: a youth full of fire and     sentiment, protesting he was misunderstood, though he was not.  Posing     as 'Velvet Coat' among the slums, he did no good to himself.  He had     not the Dickens aptitude for depicting the ways of life of his adopted     friends.  When with refined judgment he wanted a figure for a novel,     he went back to the Bar he scorned in his callow days and then drew in     _Weir of Hermiston_.\"          CHAPTER V--TRAVELS      His interest in engineering soon went--his mind full of stories and  fancies and human nature.  As he had told his mother: he did not care  about finding what was \"the strain on a bridge,\" he wanted to know  something of human beings.    No doubt, much to the disappointment and grief of his father, who wished  him as an only son to carry on the traditions of the family, though he  had written two engineering essays of utmost promise, the engineering was  given up, and he consented to study law.  He had already contributed to  College Magazines, and had had even a short spell of editing one; of one  of these he has given a racy account.  Very soon after his call to the  Bar articles and essays from his pen began to appear in _Macmillan's_,  and later, more regularly in the _Cornhill_.  Careful readers soon began  to note here the presence of a new force.  He had gone on the _Inland  Voyage_ and an account of it was in hand; and had done that tour in the  Cevennes which he has described under the title _Travels with a Donkey in  the Cevennes_, with Modestine, sometimes doubting which was the donkey,  but on that tour a chill caught either developed a germ of lung disease  already present, or produced it; and the results unfortunately remained.    He never practised at the Bar, though he tells facetiously of his one  brief.  He had chosen his own vocation, which was literature, and the  years which followed were, despite the delicacy which showed itself, very  busy years.  He produced volume on volume.  He had written many stories  which had never seen the light, but, as he says, passed through the  ordeal of the fire by more or less circuitous ways.    By this time some trouble and cause for anxiety had arisen about the  lungs, and trials of various places had been made.  _Ordered South_  suggests the Mediterranean, sunny Italy, the Riviera.  Then a sea-trip to  America was recommended and undertaken.  Unfortunately,"]]]
