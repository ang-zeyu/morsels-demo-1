He stood still for a few minutes and then the heavenly vision faded,  and like any other boy he forgot all about beauty and colour, and only  longed to be out in a boat enjoying the strange new delight.    Very lucky he thought himself when he reached the shore to find a boat  just putting of, and to hear himself invited to jump in by the boys who  were going for a sail.    Away they went, further and further from the shore, laughing and  talking. The boys were so busy telling wonderful sea-tales to the young  stranger that they did not notice how far they had gone. Then suddenly  they looked ahead and sat speechless with fear.    A great Moorish galley was bearing down upon them, its rows of oars  flashed in the sunlight, and its great painted sails towered above  their heads. It was no use trying to escape. Those strong rowers easily  overtook them, and in a few minutes Filippo and his companions were  hoisted up on board the galley.    It was all so sudden that it seemed like a dream. But the chains were  very real that were fastened round their wrists and ankles, and the  dark cruel faces of the Moors as they looked on smiling at their misery  were certainly no dream.    Then followed long days of misery when the new slaves toiled at the  oars under the blazing sun, and nights of cold and weariness. Many a  time did Filippo long for the quiet convent, the kindly brothers, and  the long peaceful days. Many a time did he long to hear the bells  calling him to prayer, which had once only filled him with restless  impatience.    But at last the galley reached the coast of Barbary, and the slaves  were unchained from the oars and taken ashore. In all his misery  Filippo's keen eyes still watched with interest the people around him,  and he was never tired of studying the swarthy faces and curious  garments of the Moorish pirates.    Then one day when he happened to be near a smooth white wall, he took a  charred stick from a fire which was built close by, and began to draw  the figure of his master.    What a delight it was to draw those rapid strokes and feel the likeness  grow beneath his fingers! He was so much interested that he did not  notice the crowd that gathered gradually round him, but he worked  steadily on until the figure was finished.    Just as the band of monks had stood silent round his first picture in  the cloister of the Carmine, so these dark Moors stood still in wonder  and amazement gazing upon the bold black figure sketched upon the  smooth white wall.    No one had ever seen such a thing in that land before, and it seemed to  them that this man must be a dealer in magic. They whispered together,  and one went off hurriedly to fetch the captain.    The master, when he came, was as astonished as the men. He could  scarcely believe his eyes when he saw a second self drawn upon the  wall, more like than his own shadow. This indeed must be no common man;  and he ordered that Filippo's chains should be immediately struck off,  and that he should be treated with respect and honour.    Nothing now was too good for this man of magic, and before long Filippo  was put on board a ship and carried safely back to Italy. They put him  ashore at Naples, and for some little time Filippo stayed there  painting pictures for the king; but his heart was in his own beloved  town, and very soon he returned to Florence.    Perhaps he did not deserve a welcome, but every one was only too  delighted to think that the runaway had really returned. Even the  prior, though he shook his head, was glad to welcome back the brother  whose painting had already brought fame and honour to the convent.    But in spite of all the troubles Filippo had gone through, he still  dearly loved the merry world and all its pleasures. For a long time he  would paint his saints and angels with all due diligence, and then he  would dash down brushes and pencils, leave his paints scattered around,  and of he would go for a holiday. Then the work would come to a  stand-still, and people must just wait until Filippo should feel  inclined to begin again.    The great Cosimo de Medici, who was always the friend of painters,  desired above all things that Fra Filippo should paint a picture for  him. And what is more, having heard so many tales about the idle ways  of this same brother, he was determined that the picture should be  painted without any interruptions.    'Fra Filippo shall take no holidays while at work for me,' he said, as  he talked the matter over with the prior.    'That may not be so easy as thou thinkest,' said the prior, for he knew  Filippo better than did this great Cosimo.    But Cosimo did not see any difficulty in the matter whatever. High in  his palace he prepared a room for the painter, and placed there  everything he could need. No comfort was lacking, and when Filippo came  he was treated as an honoured guest, except for one thing. Whenever the  heavy door of his room swung to, there was a grating sound heard, and  the key in the lock was turned from outside. So Filippo was really a  captive in his handsome prison.    That was all very well for a few days. Filippo laughed as he painted  away, and laid on the tender blue of the Virgin's robe, and painted  into her eyes the solemn look which he had so often seen on the face of  some poor peasant woman as she knelt at prayer. But after a while he  grew restless and weary of his work.    'Plague take this great man and his fine manners,' he cried. 'Does he  think he can catch a lark and train it to sing in a cage at his  bidding? I am weary of saints and angels. I must out to breathe the  fresh sweet air of heaven.'    But the key was always turned in the lock and the door was strong.  There was the window, but it was high above the street, and the grey  walls, built of huge square stones, might well have been intended to  enclose a prison rather than a palace.    It was a dark night, and the air felt hot as Filippo leaned out of the  window. Scarce a breath stirred the still air, and every sound could be  heard distinctly. Far below in the street he could hear the tread of  the people's feet, and catch the words of a merry song as a company of  boys and girls danced merrily along.         'Flower of the rose,       If I've been happy, what matter who knows,'    they sang.    It was all too tempting; out he must get. Filippo looked round his  room, and his eye rested on the bed. With a shout of triumphant delight  he ran towards it. First he seized the quilt and tore it into strips,  then the blankets, then the sheets.    'Whoever saw a grander rope?' he chuckled to himself as he knotted the  ends together.    Quick as thought he tied it to the iron bar that ran across his window,  and, squeezing out, he began to climb down, hand over hand, dangling  and swinging to and fro. The rope was stout and good, and now he could  steady himself by catching his toes in the great iron rings fastened  into the wall, until at last he dropped breathless into the street  below.    Next day, when Cosimo came to see how the painting went on, he saw  indeed the pictures and the brushes, but no painter was there. Quickly  he stepped to the open window, and there he saw the dangling rope of  sheets, and guessed at once how the bird had flown.    Through the streets they searched for the missing painter, and before  long he was found and brought back. Filippo tried to look penitent, but  his eyes were dancing with merriment, and Cosimo must needs laugh too.    'After all,' said Filippo, 'my talent is not like a beast of burden, to  be driven and beaten into doing its work. It is rather like one of  those heavenly visitors whom we willingly entertain when they deign to  visit us, but whom we can never force either to come or go at will.'    'Thou art right, friend painter,' answered the great man. 'And when I  think how thou and thy talent might have taken wings together, had not  the rope held good, I vow I will never seek to keep thee in against thy  will again.'    'Then will I work all the more willingly,' answered Filippo.    So with doors open, and freedom to come and go, Filippo no longer  wished to escape, but worked with all his heart. The beautiful Madonna  and angel were soon finished, and besides he painted a wonderful  picture of seven saints with St. John sitting in their midst.    From far and near came requests that Fra Filippo Lippi should paint  pictures for different churches and convents. He would much rather have  painted the scenes and the people he saw every day, but he remembered  the prior's lecture, and still painted only the stories of saints and  holy people--the gentle Madonna with her scarlet book of prayers, the  dove fluttering near, and the angel messenger with shining wings  bearing the lily branch. True, the saints would sometimes look out of  his pictures with the faces of some of his friends, but no one seemed  to notice that. On the whole his was a happy life, and he was always  ready to paint for any one that should ask him.    Many people now were proud to know the famous young painter, but his  old companion Fra Diamante was still the friend he loved best. Whenever  it was possible they still would work together; so, great was their  delight when one day an order came from Prato that they should both go  there to paint the walls of San Stefano.    'Good-bye to old Florence for a while,' cried Filippo as they set out  merrily together. He looked back as he spoke at the spires and sunbaked  roofs, the white marble facade of San Miniato, and the dark cypresses  standing clear against the pure warm sky of early spring.

Mi son scordato di darvi nuova,  che abbiamo qui trovato quel Sign. Belardo, ballerina, che abbiamo  conosciuto in Haye ed in Amsterdam, quello che attaco colla spada il  ballerino, il Sign. Neri, perche credeva che lui fosse cagione che non  ebbe la permission di ballar in teatro. Addio, non scordarvi di me, io  sono sempre il vostro fidele fratello.    [FOOTNOTE: \"DEAREST SISTER,--I hope you have been to see the lady--you  know who. I beg that when you see her you will give her my compliments.  I hope, and do not doubt, that you are in good health. I forgot to tell  you that we found Signor Belardo here, a dancer whom we knew at the  Hague and at Amsterdam--the same person who attacked Signor Neri with  a sword, because he thought he was the cause of his not obtaining  permission to dance in the theatre. Adieu! Do not forget me, always your  faithful brother.\"]        45.    Milan, Nov. 21, 1772.    I thank you exceedingly--you know for what. I cannot possibly write to  Herr von Heffner. When you see him, make him read aloud what follows. I  hope he will be satisfied with it:--    \"I am not to take it amiss that my unworthy friend has not answered my  letter; as soon as he has more leisure, he will certainly, beyond all  doubt, positively and punctually send me a reply.\"        46.    Milan, Nov. 28, 1772.    We both send our congratulations to Herr von Aman; tell him from me  that, owing to his having all along made a mystery of the affair, I feel  much annoyed, for I fear I may have said more than I ought about his  bride. I thought he had been more straightforward. One thing more. Say  to Herr von Aman that, if he wishes to have a right merry wedding, he  must be so kind as to wait till we return, so that what he promised me  may come to pass, namely, that I was to dance at his wedding. Tell Herr  Leitgeb [a horn-player in the Archbishop's orchestra] that he must come  straight to Milan, for he is sure to succeed well here; but he must come  soon. Pray let him know this, for I am anxious about it.        47.    Milan, Dec. 5, 1772.    I have now about fourteen pieces to write, and then I shall have  finished. [Footnote: He alludes to his Milan opera, \"Lucio Silla.\"]  Indeed, the trio and the duet may be considered as four. I cannot  possibly write much, for I have no news, and in the next place I  scarcely know what I am writing, as all my thoughts are absorbed in my  opera, so there is some danger of my writing you a whole aria instead of  a letter. I have learned a new game here, called mercanti in fiera. As  soon as I come home we can play at it together. I have also learned  a new language from Frau von Taste, which is easy to speak, though  troublesome to write, but still useful. It is, I own, rather a little  childish, but will do capitally for Salzburg. My kind regards to  pretty Nandl and to the canary, for these two and yourself are the  most innocent creatures in our house. Fischietti [the Archbishop's  Capellmeister] will no doubt soon begin to work at his opera buffa  (translated into German, his CRAZY opera!). Addio!    The following letter of Wolfgang's shows the sparkling state of his  spirits, caused by the completion of his opera. At each line he turns  the page, so that one line stands, as it were, on the head of the other.  The father, too, in the joy of his heart that the arduous work was  drawing to a close, and with it his long journey, writes four lines,  one above another, round the edge of the page, so that the whole forms a  framework for a sketch of a burning heart and four triangles (symbols  of fidelity), and a bird on the wing from whose beak a distich is  streaming:--    Oh! fly to seek my child so fair Here, and there, and everywhere!    Wolfgang adds:--        48.    Milan, Dec. 18, 1772.    I HOPE, dear sister, that you are well, dear sister. When this letter  reaches you, dear sister, my opera will be in scena, dear sister. Think  of me, dear sister, and try, dear sister, to imagine with all your might  that my dear sister sees and hears it also. In truth, it is hard to say,  as it is now eleven o'clock at night, but I do believe, and don't at  all doubt, that in the daytime it is brighter than at Easter. My dear  sister, to-morrow we dine with Herr von Mayer; and do you know why?  Guess! Because he invited us. The rehearsal to-morrow is to be in the  theatre. The impresario, Signor Cassiglioni, has entreated me not to say  a word of this to a soul, as all kinds of people would come crowding in,  and that we don't wish. So, my child, I beg, my child, that you won't  say one syllable to any one on the subject, or too many people would  come crowding in, my child. Approposito, do you know the history  that occurred here? Well, I will relate it to you. We were going home  straight from Count Firmiani's, and when we came into our street we  opened our door, and what do you think happened? We went in. Good-bye,  my pet. Your unworthy brother (frater),    WOLFGANG.        On the 26th of December \"an incomparable performance\" of \"Lucio Silla\"  took place; it was eminently successful, and continued to fill the house  night after night in the most surprising way. The father writes home  regularly, and Wolfgang subjoins the usual postscripts, which, however,  at this time contain nothing worth quoting. We give only part of an  Italian letter which he writes for practice:--        49.    .... Vi prego di dire al Sig. Giovanni Hagenauer da parte mia, che non  dubiti, che andro a veder sicuramente in quella bottega delle armi, se  ci sono quei nomi [?] che lui desidera, e che senza dubbio doppo averlo  trovato le portero meco a Salisburgo. Mi dispiace che il Sig. Leitgeb  e partito tanto tardi da Salisburgo [see No. 46] che non trovera piu in  scena la mia opera e forte non ci trovera nemeno, se non in viaggio.    Hieri sera era la prima prova coi stromenti della seconda opera, ma ho  sentito solamente il primo atto, perche a secondo mene andiedi essendo  gia tardi. In quest' opera saranno sopra il balco 24 cavalli e . . .  mondo di gente, che saro miracolo se non succede qualche disgrazia. La  musica mi piace; se piace al replico non so, perche alle prime prove non  e lecito l' andarci che alle personne che sono del Teatro. Io spero che  domani il mio padre potra uscir di casa. Sta sera fa cativissimo tempo.  La Signora Teyber e adesso a Bologna e il carnevale venturo recitera a  Turino e l'anno sussiquente poi va a cantare a Napoli.    [Footnote: \"Pray say from me to Johannes Hagenauer, that he may entirely  rely on my going to the armorer's shop, to see if I can procure what  he desires, and after getting it I will not fail to bring it with me to  Salzburg. I regret that Herr Leitgeb delayed so long leaving Salzburg  [see No. 46], for he will no longer find my opera in scena, nor will he  find us either unless we meet on our travels. Yesterday evening was our  first rehearsal of the second opera with instruments, but I only heard  the first act, for I went away at the second, because it was so very  late. In this opera there are to be twenty-four horses and a crowd of  people on the stage at the same time, so it will be surprising if no  accident happens. The music pleases me; whether it will please others  I cannot tell, for no persons but those belonging to the theatre are  permitted to attend the first rehearsals. I hope that papa will be able  to leave the house to-morrow. The weather is detestable this evening.  Madame Teyber is now at Bologna; she is to act at Turin in the ensuing  Carnival, and the year following she is to sing at Naples.\"]    After enjoying some more of the amusements of the Carnival, they arrived  again in Salzburg about the middle of March. This place, or rather their  position at court there, was in the highest degree repugnant to both; so  the father, in the course of his travels, applied to the Grand-Duke of  Tuscany for an appointment for his son. As, however, nothing was to  be got in that quarter, he directed his views to the Imperial capital  itself; and thus, at the end of three months, we find him again with  his son in Vienna. From thence Wolfgang often wrote to his loved ones at  home.        50.    Vienna, August 14, 1773.    I HOPE that your Majesty [Footnote 1: O. Jahn remarks that this epithet  is a reminiscence of a fantastic game that often amused the boy on his  journeys. He imagined a kingdom, the inhabitants of which were endowed  with every gift that could make them good and happy.] enjoys the best  state of health; and yet that now and then--or rather sometimes--or,  better still, from time to time--or, still better, qualche volta, as  the Italians say--your Majesty will impart to me some of your grave  and important thoughts (emanating from that most admirable and solid  judgment which, in addition to beauty, your Majesty so eminently  possesses; and thus, although in such tender years, my Queen casts into  the shade not only the generality of men but even the gray-haired).    P. S. This is a most sensible production.        51.    Vienna, August 21, 1773.    When we contemplate the benefit of time, and yet are not entirely  oblivious of the estimation in which we ought to hold the sun, then it  is quite certain, Heaven be praised! that I am quite well. My second  proposition is of a very different character. Instead of sun, let us  put moon, and instead of benefit, science; then any one, gifted with  a certain amount of reasoning powers, will at once draw the conclusion  that--I am a fool because you are my sister. How is Miss Bimbles? [the  dog.] I beg you will convey all sorts of amiable messages from me to  her. I also send my kind remembrances to M. Kreibich [conductor of the  Imperial chamber-music], whom we knew at Presburg and also at Vienna;  and very best regards from Her Majesty the Empress, Frau Fischerin, and  Prince Kaunitz. Oidda!
