He was above normal in intellectual ability, but  lacking in moral development.  He did not love parents, brothers,  sisters, or teachers; he was very egotistical.  Jorger defines  this as a case of constitutional psychosis.  When older,  pseudologia phantastica controlled him; it was like hypnotic  influence, his dreams of wealth were like paranoia.  His hypnotic  condition grew to such an extent that there was an interruption  of consciousness with following amnesia.      [15]``Beitrage zur Kenntnisse der Pseudologin phantastica.''  Viertel-jahrschrift fur gerichtliche Medicin und offentliches  Sanitatswesen, 1904 Bd. XXVII; pp. 189-242.        Henneberg[16] cites another case of a highly educated young man  who told wonderful stories in childhood and later obtained money  under false pretenses with elaborate deception.  From an  eccentric grandmother, and a mother who was very excitable and  suffered from hysteria, he inherited a nervous system which was  not calculated to bear the strain which his own overzealous  efforts in pursuing his studies and his spiritual exaltation put  upon it, hence the mental and moral breakdown.  This is a very  interesting case because it does not fit into the usual group of  pathological liars.      [16] ``Zur kasuistischen und klin.  Beurteilung der Pseudologia  phantastica.''  Charite-Annalen, XXV, XXVI.        Wendt[17] enlarges the field in which we may look for such cases.  He finds pseudologia phantastica a symptom, not only of hysteria,  alcoholism, paranoia, but also of sex repression, and  neurasthenia.  He takes a more philosophical view of the subject  than previous authors.  He understands by pseudologia phantastica  not merely the bare habit of telling fantastic lies, and what  they bring forth, but rather the yielding up of consciousness of  reality in the presence of the morbidly fantastic wish in its  widest consequences.  Since the wish in order to exist is not  permitted to lose entirely the conscious presentation of what it  hopes for, so memory and recognition of reality emerge  disconnected in consciousness, and a condition described as  double consciousness arises.  In this state of mind two forms of  life run side by side, the actual and the desired, finally the  latter becomes preponderant and decisive.  Such a psychic make-up  must lead unconditionally and necessarily to swindling and law  breaking.  A degenerative alteration furnishes the basis from  which a wish or wish-complex arises, increasing in force until it  becomes autosuggestion, hence it is pathological.  Then follow  the practical consequences, and we have developed, on the one  side, pathological lying, and, on the other, swindling, i.e.,  criminality.  Purely symptomatically pseudologia phantastica is  characterized by the groundlessness of the fabrications, the  heightened suggestibility of the patient, and in its wake arises  double consciousness and inadequate powers of reproduction of  reality.      [17] ``Ein Beitrag zur Kasuistik der Pseudologia phantastica.''  Allgemeine Zeitschrift fur Psychiatrie, LXVIII, Heft 4; pp.  482-500.        Wendt gives at length the history of a precocious boy, the son of  an official of medical rank, who had lived always with older  people.  He lied from early childhood.  He was a chronic sufferer  from severe headaches.  Between the ages of 15 and 17 this boy  showed evidences of literary talent, but was poor in mathematics.  From a tender age he had an overmastering desire to become great;  he said he wished to become a jurist because only jurists get the  high offices.  He entered a South German university, rented a  fine apartment, stated he was accustomed to a Schloss, his father  was a high state official.  He later called himself Graf  Friedrich Gersdorf auf Blankenhain.  The young man's deceits grew  rapidly, he obtained much money falsely, traveled first class  with a body servant.  He passed to other universities, was always  quiet and industrious.  After many adventures he fell into the  hands of the law and was adjudged insane.  Most interesting was  the fact that he discussed intelligently his career.  ``My  capacity for considering my thoughts as something really carried  out in life is unfortunately too great to permit my having full  conception of the boundary between appearance and reality.''    The family history of the above case included swindling,  hysteria, and epilepsy.  His fabricating tendency first reached  its height at 14 years, thus showing the influence of puberty.  Wendt regarded the etiological factors as family degeneracy, a  wish-complex which in activity amounted to autosuggestion, double  consciousness, and a periodical preponderance of the wished for  personality.    Bresler[18] in proposing two reforms in the German  ``Strafgesetzbuch'' undertook a discussion of pathological  accusations, as material using cases reported by several authors.  He attempted a classification as follows:  1. Deliberately false  accusations based upon the pathological disposition or impulse to  lie; the content of the accusation being fabricated.  2. False  accusation upon a basis of pathologically disturbed perceptions  or reasoning.  Content of the accusation is here illusion,  hallucination, or delusion.  3. Accusations correct in content,  but pathologically motivated.      [18] ``Die pathologische Anschuldigung.''  Juristisch-psychiatrische Grenzfragen, Band V, Heft 8, pp. 42.        The first group nearly always is the action of hystericals, and  many are centered on sex affairs.  Bresler's cited cases of this  class seem merely to impress the idea of revenge, or of  protection from deserved punishment.  A very complicated case was  that of a girl who had been rejected in marriage after the  discovery by her lover that she had attacks of major hysteria.  She entered into a conspiracy with her mother to destroy him.  She first maliciously cut grape vines and accused him and his  brother of doing it.  Then she slandered his whole family.  A  year later, suddenly appearing wounded, she accused his uncle of  trying to kill her and obtained a verdict against him.  Then she  attempted the same with another uncle who, however, maintained an  alibi.  After this her role changed, for her mother summoned  people to see her daughter lying with a wreath around her head,  brought by an angel, with a scroll on which was inscribed  ``Corona Martyri.''  The church now took her part and she toured  the country as a sort of saint.  Later she returned to her former  tactics, she set fire to a house, cut off a cow's udder, and  accused her former lover of these deeds.  Now for the first time  it went badly with her.  She was finally imprisoned for life on  account of attempts to poison people.    In Bresler's second group he places the false accusations of  alcoholics, paranoiacs, querulants (whom he calls a sub-class of  paranoiacs) and sufferers from head injuries.  Besides these, he  here classes the false accusations of children.    The third class is so rare that it receives almost no discussion.    Longard[19] reports an interesting case of a chronic liar and  swindler, a man who on account of the peculiarities of his  swindling was placed under custody for study.  Upon detention he  went into convulsions and later seemed entirely distracted.  He  was then 24 years old.  Investigation of his case showed that his  abnormalities dated from early life and were probably due to the  fact that in childhood he had a bad fall from a height.  When he  was 23 he had served six months on account of swindling.  At that  time he had been going about in the Rhine country dressed as a  monk, begging things of little worth, such as crucifixes,  candles, medals, etc.  His pious behavior and orderliness gave  him a good reception.  He sometimes took money or begged it in  order to read masses for poor souls.  In one village he said he  had come to reconnoiter for a site to build a hospital.  Some  cloister brothers in one place took him for a swindler and  decided he was overwrought religiously, and that he really  thought he was what he wished to become.  He was studied at  length in prison where he had one attack of maniacal behavior and  tried to hang himself.  The physician there thought him a  simulator.  He was excused from his military service because of  stomach trouble.  At that time mental abnormalities were not  noticed.  After this he again acted the part of a monk, wandering  through France and Germany, living in monasteries, and being  helped along by different organizations, Protestant as well as  Catholic.  He was arrested in Cologne when discovered to be a  fraud.  He lay four days in jail apparently unconscious and then  appeared stupefied and staggered about.  When questioned he  responded, ``I am born again.''  He spoke mostly in Biblical  terms and was fluent with pious speeches.  He was found quite  sound physically.  He ate a great deal and was known to take  bread away from other prisoners at night.  He was sentenced for  15 months for swindling.  He himself related that in youth he had  seen many monks and had become possessed of the idea of being  one.  He was a sex pervert.      [19] ``Ein forensisch interessanter Fall.  Pseudologia  phantastica.'' Allg. Zeitschrift f. Psych. LV, p. 88.        The author considered this not a pure case of simulation; the  patient was an abnormal being, none of his keepers thought him  normal.  His entire appearance, his excited way of speaking, his  gestures and play of features were all striking to a high degree.  His method of going about begging was unreasonable; he gained so  little by it.  His tendency to untruthfulness stood out  everywhere.  He imitated the pious as he chattered without aim.  The man had lived himself into the role of a cloister brother so  completely that he was not clearly conscious of the deceit.

Do  away with one set of rulers, and you have only the same materials to  make another of; and if ever so honestly disposed, they are surrounded  with such a train of circumstances, over which they have no control,  that they cannot mend them.    There is frequently much excitement on this subject; and many people  ignorant of these things, are led to suppose that their resources will  be increased, and their circumstances bettered; but when they find,  after much contention, struggling, and bloodshed, that it does not rain  bread, cheese, and clothing; that it is only a change of men, papers,  and parchment, chagrin and disappointment naturally follow. There is  much that is good, and much that is bad in all governments; and I am  not seeking here to portray a perfect government, but to show some of  the evils associated with them, and the utter incompetency of all the  plans of men to restore a perfect government; and as all their plans  have failed, so they will fail, for it is the work of God, and not of  man. The moral agency of man without God, has had its full development;  his weakness, wickedness, and corruption, have placed the world where  it is: he can see as in a glass his incompetency, and folly, and  nothing but the power of God can restore it.    It is not to be wondered at, that those various plans should exist, for  the world is in a horrible situation. Jesus prophesied of it, and said,  there should be upon the earth \"distress of nations, perplexity, men's  hearts failing them, for fear, and for looking after those things which  are coming upon the earth,\" Luke xxi. 25, 26. Men see these things,  and their hearts fear; confusion, disorder, misery, blood, and ruin,  seem to stare them in the face; and in the absence of something great,  noble, and magnificent, suited to the exigency of the case, they try  the foregoing remedies, as a sailor, in the absence of a boat, would  cling with tenacity to any floating piece of wreck, to save him from a  watery grave.    Neither can men be blamed for trying to do good; it is certainly a  laudable object; and with all the selfishness, ambition, and pride,  associated with the foregoing, it must be admitted that there is much  uprightness, sincerity, and honest zeal.    There are very many philanthropists who would gladly ameliorate the  condition of men, and of the world, if they knew how. But the means  employed are not commensurate with the end; every grade of society is  vitiated and corrupt. \"The whole head is sick, and the whole heart  faint.\" Our systems, our policy, our legislation, our education, and  philosophy, are all wrong, neither can we be particularly blamed, for  these evils have been the growth of ages. Our fathers have left God,  his guidance, control, and support, and we have been left to ourselves;  and our present position is a manifest proof of our incompetency to  govern; and our past failures make it evident, that any future effort,  with the same means, would be as useless. The world is diseased, and it  requires a world's remedy.        Chapter IV.  ------------------    What Is Man? What Is His Destiny and Relationship to God?    Having shewn in the foregoing chapters, that the rule of God is perfect  where he governs alone, that the rule of man is imperfect, and has  introduced confusion and misery, and that the plans of men are not  competent to restore the world to happiness, and the fulfilment of the  object for which it was created; it now devolves upon us to investigate  the way that this thing can, and will be accomplished; for there is  a time spoken of in the Scriptures, when there will be a reign of  righteousness.    First, then, we will enquire who and what is man? and what is his  destiny, and what his relationship to God? For before we can define  government correctly, it will be necessary to find out the nature of  the being that has to be governed.    What, then, is man? Is he a being temporal and earthly alone, and  when he dies, does he sink into forgetfulness? Is he annihilated? or  has he a spirit as well as a body? If the first be the case, he alone  has a right to regulate his own affairs, to frame his own government,  and to pursue that course which to him seems good; if not, the case  is different. I do not here wish to enter into a philosophical  disquisition on the subject, but, as I am writing at present to  believers in the Bible, I shall confine myself more to that. I will  state, that man is an eternal being, composed of body and spirit: his  spirit existed before he came here; his body exists with the spirit  in time, and after death the spirit exists without the body. In the  resurrection, both body and spirit will finally be reunited; and it  requires both body and spirit to make a perfect man, whether in time,  or eternity.    I know there are those who suppose that the spirit of man comes into  existence with his body, and that intelligence and spirit are organized  with the body; but we read, that when God made man, he made him of the  dust of the earth; he made him in his own likeness. Man was then a  lifeless body; He afterwards \"breathed into him the breath of life, and  man became a living soul.\"    Before that spirit was given, he was dead, lifeless; and when that  spirit is taken away, he is again lifeless; and let not any one say  that the body is perfect without the spirit; for the moment the spirit  leaves the body, no matter how perfect its organization may be, the man  is inanimate, and destitute of intelligence and feeling: \"it is the  spirit that gives life.\" Hence we find that when Jarius's daughter was  dead, his servant came and told him, saying, \"Thy daughter is dead,  trouble not the master;\" but when she was restored, it is said \"her  spirit _came again_, and she arose straightway.\" Luke viii. 55. When  her spirit was absent, the body was dead; when it returned, the body  lived. \"Moses spake unto the Lord, and said, let the Lord, the God of  _the spirits of all flesh_, set a man over the congregation.\" Num.  xxvii. 16. Again, the Lord in speaking to Jeremiah, said, \"Before I  formed thee in the belly, I knew thee,\" i. 5. I would ask, What part  of Jeremiah did he know? It could not be his body, for it was not  in existence; but he knew his spirit, for \"he was the father of his  spirit.\" The Lord speaks to Job and says, \"Where wast thou when I laid  the foundations of the earth? declare if thou hast understanding, who  hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched  the line upon it. Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?  or who laid the corner stone thereof? when the morning stars sung  together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" xxxviii. 4, 6.  Again, John says, \"They that dwell on the earth, shall wonder, whose  names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the  world.\" Rev. xvii. 8.    This spirit proceeds forth from God, and is eternal; hence Solomon  says, in speaking of death, \"Then shall the dust return to the earth as  it was, and the spirit unto God who gave it.\" Eccles. xii. 7. That the  spirit is eternal, is very evident, from the Scriptures; Jesus prayed  to his father, and said, \"O Father, glorify thou me, with thine own  self, with the glory which I had with thee _before the world was_.\"  John xvii. 5. Here Jesus speaks of an existence before he came here,  of a glory he had with his Father before the world was. Christ, then,  existed before he came here and took a body. Again Jesus says, \"I have  manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world:  thine they were, and thou gavest them me.\" John xvii. 6.    Let us see what the Apostle Paul says on the subject: \"Blessed be the  God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all  spiritual blessings, in heavenly places, in Christ; according as he  hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world.\" Ephes. i,  3, 4. Christ, then, existed with his Father before the world was, and  the Saints existed in, or with him. What part? their bodies? no, their  spirits. Again, man exists after he leaves here. It is unnecessary to  say anything about the life of the spirit, after the death of the body,  or of the resurrection, as the subjects are so generally known and  believed. Paul says, \"If in this life only, we have hope in Christ, we  are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead,  and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came  death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. ... The trumpet  shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall  be changed; for this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this  mortal must put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the  saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.\" 1 Cor. xv.  19-21, 52-54.    If man, then, is an eternal being, came from God, exists here for a  short time, and will return, it is necessary that he know something  about God, and his government. For he has to do with him not only in  time, but in eternity, and whatever man may be disposed to do, or  however he may vaunt himself of his own abilities, there are some  things he has no control over. He came into the world without his  agency, he will have to leave it, whether he desires it or not; and  he will also have to appear in another world. He is destined, if he  improves his opportunities, to higher and greater blessings and glory  than are associated with this earth in its present state: and hence  the necessity of the guidance of a superior power, and intelligence,  that he may not act the part of a fool here, and jeopardize his  eternal interests; but that his intelligence may be"]]]
