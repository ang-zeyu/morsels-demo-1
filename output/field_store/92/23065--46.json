The latter is the peculiar province  of the poor; moreover, this time I resolved, for other reasons, to be  patient. I repeated my question in almost the same words. Ruh! \"Be  off,\" was what I obtained for all reply. But this time the questioned  went so far as to open his eyes. Still I stood twirling the paper in my  hands, and looking very humble and very persevering, till a loud Ruh ya  Kalb! \"Go, O dog!\" converted into a responsive curse the little speech  I was preparing about    [p.21]the brotherhood of Al-Islam and the mutual duties obligatory on  true believers. I then turned away slowly and fiercely, for the next  thing might have been a cut with the Kurbaj,[FN#7] and, by the hammer  of Thor! British flesh and blood could never have stood that.    After which satisfactory scene,-for satisfactory it was in one sense,  proving the complete fitness of the Darwaysh's costume,-I tried a dozen  other promiscuous sources of information,-policemen, grooms, scribes,  donkey-boys, and idlers in general. At length, wearied of patience, I  offered a soldier some pinches of tobacco, and promised him an Oriental  sixpence if he would manage the business for me. The man was interested  by the tobacco and the pence; he took my hand, and inquiring the while  he went along, led me from place to place, till, mounting a grand  staircase, I stood in the presence of Abbas Effendi, Naib or deputy to  the Governor.    It was a little, whey-faced, black-bearded Turk, coiled up in the usual  conglomerate posture upon a calico-covered diwan, at the end of a long,  bare, large- windowed room. Without deigning even to nod the head,  which hung over his shoulder with transcendent listlessness and  affectation of pride, in answer to my salams and benedictions, he eyed  me with wicked eyes, and faintly ejaculated \"Min ent[FN#8]?\" Then  hearing that I was a Darwaysh and doctor-he must be an Osmanli  Voltairean, that little Turk-the official snorted a contemptuous snort.  He condescendingly added, however, that the proper source to seek was  \"Taht,\" which, meaning simply \"below,\" conveyed to an utter stranger  rather imperfect information from a topographical point of view.    At length, however, my soldier guide found out that    [p.22]a room in the custom-house bore the honourable appellation of  \"Foreign Office.\" Accordingly I went there, and, after sitting at least  a couple of hours at the bolted door in the noon-day sun, was told,  with a fury which made me think I had sinned, that the officer in whose  charge the department was, had been presented with an olive branch in  the morning, and consequently that business was not to be done that  day. The angry-faced official communicated the intelligence to a large  group of Anadolian, Caramanian, Bosniac, and Roumelian Turks,-sturdy,  undersized, broad-shouldered, bare-legged, splay-footed, horny-fisted,  dark-browed, honest-looking mountaineers, who were lounging about with  long pistols and yataghans stuck in their broad sashes, head-gear  composed of immense tarbushes with proportionate turbands coiled round  them, and bearing two or three suits of substantial clothes, even at  this season of the year, upon their shoulders.    Like myself they had waited some hours, but they were not so patient  under disappointment: they bluntly told the angry official that he and  his master were a pair of idlers, and the curses that rumbled and  gurgled in their hairy throats as they strode towards the door sounded  like the growling of wild beasts.    Thus was another day truly orientally lost. On the morrow, however, I  obtained permission, in the character of Dr. Abdullah, to visit any  part of Egypt I pleased, and to retain possession of my dagger and  pistols.    And now I must explain what induced me to take so much trouble about a  passport. The home reader naturally inquires, Why not travel under your  English name?    For this reason. In the generality of barbarous countries you must  either proceed, like Bruce, preserving the \"dignity of manhood,\" and  carrying matters with a high hand, or you must worm your way by  timidity and    [p.23]subservience; in fact, by becoming an animal too contemptible for  man to let or injure. But to pass through the Moslem's Holy Land, you  must either be a born believer, or have become one; in the former case  you may demean yourself as you please, in the latter a path is ready  prepared for you. My spirit could not bend to own myself a Burma,[FN#9]  a renegade-to be pointed at and shunned and catechised, an object of  suspicion to the many and of contempt to all. Moreover, it would have  obstructed the aim of my wanderings. The convert is always watched with  Argus eyes, and men do not willingly give information to a \"new  Moslem,\" especially a Frank: they suspect his conversion to be feigned  or forced, look upon him as a spy, and let him see as little of life as  possible. Firmly as was my heart set upon travelling in Arabia, by  Heaven! I would have given up the dear project rather than purchase a  doubtful and partial success at such a price. Consequently, I had no  choice but to appear as a born believer, and part of my birthright in  that respectable character was toil and trouble in obtaining a  Tazkirah.[FN#10]    Then I had to provide myself with certain necessaries for the way.  These were not numerous. The silver-mounted dressing-bag is here  supplied by a rag containing a Miswak[FN#11] or tooth-stick, a bit of  soap and a comb, wooden, for bone and tortoiseshell are not,  religiously speaking, correct. Equally simple was my wardrobe; [p.24]a  change or two of clothing. It is a great mistake to carry too few  clothes, and those who travel as Orientals should always have at least  one very grand suit for use on critical occasions. Throughout the East  a badly dressed man is a pauper, and, as in England, a pauper-unless he  belongs to an order having a right to be poor-is a scoundrel. The only  article of canteen description was a Zemzemiyah, a goat-skin water-bag,  which, especially when new, communicates to its contents a ferruginous  aspect and a wholesome, though hardly an attractive, flavour of  tanno-gelatine. This was a necessary; to drink out of a tumbler,  possibly fresh from pig-eating lips, would have entailed a certain loss  of reputation. For bedding and furniture I had a coarse Persian  rug-which, besides being couch, acted as chair, table, and oratory-a  cotton-stuffed chintz-covered pillow, a blanket in case of cold, and a  sheet, which did duty for tent and mosquito curtains in nights of  heat.[FN#12] As shade is a convenience not always procurable, another  necessary was a huge cotton umbrella of Eastern make, brightly yellow,  suggesting the idea of an overgrown marigold. I had also a substantial  housewife, the gift of a kind relative, Miss Elizabeth Stisted; it was  a roll of canvas, carefully soiled, and garnished with needles and  thread, cobblers' wax, buttons, and other such articles. These things  were most useful in lands where tailors abound not; besides which, the  sight of a man darning his coat or patching his slippers teems with  pleasing ideas of humility. A dagger,[FN#13] a brass inkstand and  pen-holder    [p.25]stuck in the belt, and a mighty rosary, which on occasion might  have been converted into a weapon of offence, completed my equipment. I  must not omit to mention the proper method of carrying money, which in  these lands should never be entrusted to box or bag. A common cotton  purse secured in a breast pocket (for Egypt now abounds in that  civilised animal, the pick-pocket!), contained silver pieces and small  change.[FN#14] My gold, of which I carried twenty-five sovereigns, and  papers, were committed to a substantial leathern belt of Maghrabi  manufacture, made to be strapped round the waist under the dress. This  is the Asiatic method of concealing valuables, and one more civilised  than ours in the last century, when Roderic Random and his companion  \"sewed their money between the lining and the waist-band of their  breeches, except some loose silver for immediate    [p.26]expense on the road.\" The great inconvenience of the belt is its  weight, especially where dollars must be carried, as in Arabia, causing  chafes and discomfort at night. Moreover, it can scarcely be called  safe. In dangerous countries wary travellers will adopt surer  precautions.  [FN#16]    A pair of common native Khurjin, or saddle-bags, contained my wardrobe;  the bed was readily rolled up into a bundle; and for a medicine  chest[FN#17] I bought a pea-green box with red and yellow flowers,  capable of standing falls from a camel twice a day.    [p.27]The next step was to find out when the local steamer would start  for Cairo, and accordingly I betook myself to the Transit Office. No  vessel was advertised; I was directed to call every evening till  satisfied. At last the fortunate event took place: a \"weekly  departure,\" which, by the bye, occurred once every fortnight or so, was  in orders for the next day. I hurried to the office, but did not reach  it till past noon-the hour of idleness. A little, dark gentleman-Mr.  Green-so formed and dressed as exactly to resemble a liver-and-tan  bull-terrier, who with his heels on the table was dosing, cigar in  mouth, over the last \"Galignani,\" positively refused, after a time,-for  at first he would not speak at all,-to let me take my passage till  three in the afternoon. I inquired when the boat started, upon which he  referred me, as I had spoken bad Italian, to the advertisement. I  pleaded inability to read or write, whereupon he testily cried Alle  nove! alle nove!-at nine! at nine! Still appearing uncertain, I drove  him out of his chair, when he rose with a curse and read 8 A.M.

Moreover, entering Arabia by Al-Hijaz, as has  before been said, I was obliged to leave behind all my instruments  except a watch and a pocket-compass, so the benefit rendered to  geography by my trip would have been scanty. Still remained    [p.31] to me the comfort of reflecting that possibly at Meccah some  opportunity of crossing the Peninsula might present itself. At any rate  I had the certainty of seeing the strange wild country of the Hijaz,  and of being present at the ceremonies of the Holy City. I must request  the reader to bear with a Visitation once more: we shall conclude it  with a ride to Al-Bakia.[FN#6] This venerable spot is frequented by the  pious every day after the prayer at the Prophets Tomb, and especially on  Fridays.    Our party started one morning,on donkeys, as usual, for my foot was not  yet strong,along the Darb al-Janazah round the Southern wall of the  town. The locomotion was decidedly slow, principally in consequence of  the tent-ropes which the Hajis had pinned down literally all over the  plain, and falls were by no means unfrequent. At last we arrived at the  end of the Darb, where I committed myself by mistaking the decaying  place of those miserable schismatics the Nakhawilah[FN#7] for Al-Bakia,  the glorious cemetery of the Saints. Hamid corrected my blunder with  tartness, to which I replied as tartly, that in our countryAfghanistanwe  burned the body of every heretic upon whom we could lay our hands. This  truly Islamitic custom was heard with general applause, and as the  little dispute ended, we stood at the open gate of Al-Bakia. Then  having dismounted I sat down on a low Dakkah or stone bench within the  walls, to obtain a general view and to prepare for the most fatiguing  of the Visitations.    There is a tradition that seventy thousand, or according to others a  hundred thousand saints, all with faces like full moons, shall cleave  on the last day the yawning bosom    [p.32] of Al-Bakia.[FN#8] About ten thousand of the Ashab (Companions  of the Prophet) and innumerable Sadat are here buried: their graves are  forgotten, because, in the olden time, tombstones were not placed over  the last resting-places of mankind. The first of flesh who shall arise  is Mohammed, the second Abu Bakr, the third Omar, then the people of  Al-Bakia (amongst whom is Osman, the fourth Caliph), and then the  incol[ae] of the Jannat al-Maala, the Meccan cemetery. The Hadis, whoever  dies at the two Harims shall rise with the Sure on the Day of judgment,  has made these spots priceless in value. And even upon earth they might  be made a mine of wealth. Like the catacombs at Rome, Al-Bakia is  literally full of the odour of sanctity, and a single item of the great  aggregate here would render any other Moslem town famous. It is a pity  that this people refuses to exhume its relics.    The first person buried in Al-Bakia was Osman bin Mazun, the first of  the Muhajirs, who died at Al-Madinah. In the month of Shaaban, A.H. 3,  the Prophet kissed the forehead of the corpse and ordered it to be  interred within sight of his abode.[FN#9] In those days the field was  covered with the tree Gharkad; the vegetation was cut down, the ground  was levelled, and Osman was placed in the centre of the new cemetery.  With his own hands Mohammed planted two large upright stones at the  head and the feet of his faithful follower[FN#10]; and in process of  time a dome covered the spot. Ibrahim, the Prophets infant second    [p.33] son, was laid by Osmans side, after which Al-Bakia became a  celebrated cemetery.    The Burial-place of the Saints is an irregular oblong surrounded by  walls which are connected with the suburb at their south-west angle.  The Darb al-Janazah separates it from the enceinte of the town, and the  eastern Desert Road beginning from the Bab al-Jumah bounds it on the  North. Around it palm plantations seem to flourish. It is small,  considering the extensive use made of it: all that die at Al-Madinah,  strangers as well as natives, except only heretics and schismatics,  expect to be interred in it. It must be choked with corpses, which it  could never contain did not the Moslem style of burial greatly favour  rapid decomposition; and it has all the inconveniences of intramural  sepulture. The gate is small and ignoble; a mere doorway in the wall.  Inside there are no flower-plots, no tall trees, in fact none of the  refinements which lightens the gloom of a Christian burial-place: the  buildings are simple, they might even be called mean. Almost all are  the common Arab Mosque, cleanly whitewashed, and looking quite new. The  ancient monuments were levelled to the ground by Saad the Wahhabi and  his puritan followers, who waged pitiless warfare against what must  have appeared to them magnificent mausolea, deeming as they did a loose  heap of stones sufficient for a grave. In Burckhardts time the whole  place was a confused accumulation of heaps of earth, wide pits, and  rubbish, without a singular regular tomb-stone. The present erections  owe their existence, I was told, to the liberality of the Sultans Abd  al-Hamid and Mahmud.    A poor pilgrim has lately started on his last journey, and his corpse,  unattended by friends or mourners, is carried upon the shoulders of  hired buriers into the cemetery. Suddenly they stay their rapid steps,  and throw the body upon the ground. There is a life-like pliability    [p.34] about it as it falls, and the tight cerements so define the  outlines that the action makes me shudder. It looks almost as if the  dead were conscious of what is about to occur. They have forgotten  their tools; one man starts to fetch them, and three sit down to smoke.  After a time a shallow grave is hastily scooped out.[FN#11] The corpse  is packed in it with such unseemly haste that earth touches it in all  directions,cruel carelessness among Moslems, who believe this to torture  the sentient frame.[FN#12] One comfort suggests itself. The poor man  being a pilgrim has died Shahidin martyrdom. Ere long his spirit shall  leave Al-Bakia,    And he on honey-dew shall feed,  And drink the milk of Paradise.    I entered the holy cemetery right foot forwards, as if it were a  Mosque, and barefooted, to avoid suspicion of being a heretic. For  though the citizens wear their shoes in the Bakia, they are much  offended at seeing the Persians follow their example. We began by the  general benediction[FN#13]: Peace be upon Ye, O People of Al-Bakia!  Peace be upon Ye, O Admitted to the Presence of the    [p.35] Most High! Receive Ye what Ye have been promised! Peace be upon  Ye, Martyrs of Al-Bakia, One and All! We verily, if Allah please, are  about to join You! O Allah, pardon us and Them, and the Mercy of God,  and His Blessings! After which we recited the Chapter Al-Ikhlas and the  Testification, then raised our hands, mumbled the Fatihah, passed our  palms down our faces, and went on.    Walking down a rough narrow path, which leads from the western to the  eastern extremity of Al-Bakia, we entered the humble mausoleum of the  Caliph OsmanOsman Al-Mazlum, or the ill-treated, he is called by some  Moslems. When he was slain,[FN#14] his friends wished to bury him by  the Prophet in the Hujrah, and Ayishah made no objection to the  measure. But the people of Egypt became violent; swore that the corpse  should neither be buried nor be prayed over, and only permitted it to  be removed upon the threat of Habibah (one of the Mothers of the Moslems,  and daughter of Abu Sufiyan) to expose her countenance. During the  night that followed his death, Osman was carried out by several of his  friends to Al-Bakia, from which, however, they were driven away, and  obliged to deposit their burden in a garden, eastward of and outside  the saints cemetery. It was called Hisn Kaukab, and was looked upon as  an inauspicious place of sepulture, till Marwan included it in  Al-Bakia. We stood before Osmans monument, repeating, Peace be upon Thee,  O our Lord Osman, Son of Affan![FN#15] Peace be upon    [p.36] Thee, O Caliph of Allahs Apostle! Peace be upon Thee, O Writer of  Allahs Book! Peace be upon Thee, in whose Presence the Angels are  ashamed![FN#16] Peace be upon Thee, O Collector of the Koran! Peace be  upon Thee, O Son-in-Law of the Prophet! Peace be upon Thee, O Lord of  the Two Lights (the two daughters of Mohammed)![FN#17] Peace be upon  Thee, who fought the Battle of the Faith! Allah be satisfied with Thee,  and cause Thee to be satisfied, and render Heaven thy Habitation! Peace  be upon Thee, and the Mercy of Allah and His Blessing, and Praise be to  Allah, Lord of the (three) Worlds! This supplication concluded in the  usual manner. After which we gave alms, and settled with ten piastres  the demands of the Khadim[FN#18] who takes charge of the tomb: this  double-disbursing process had to be repeated at each station.    Then moving a few paces to the North, we faced Eastwards, and performed  the Visitation of Abu Said al-Khazari, a Sahib or Companion of the  Prophet, whose sepulchre lies outside Al-Bakia. The third place visited  was a dome containing the tomb of our lady Halimah, the Badawi  wet-nurse who took charge of Mohammed[FN#19]:    [p.37] she is addressed hus; Peace be upon Thee, O Halimah the  Auspicious![FN#20] Peace be upon Thee, who performed thy Trust in  suckling the Best of Mankind! Peace be upon Thee, O Wet-nurse of  Al-Mustafa (the chosen)! Peace be upon Thee, O Wet-nurse of Al-Mujtaba  (the (accepted)![FN#21] May Allah be satisfied with Thee, and cause  Thee to be satisfied, and render Heaven thy House and Habitation! and  verily we have come visiting Thee, and by means of Thee drawing near to  Allahs Prophet, and through Him to God, the Lord of the Heavens and the  Earths.[FN#22]    After which, fronting the North, we stood before a low enclosure,  containing ovals of loose stones, disposed"]]]
