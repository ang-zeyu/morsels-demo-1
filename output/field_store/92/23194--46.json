Fortunately the fruits we gathered were at their maturity. We sent  some to Europe, and they have germinated in the gardens of Berlin,  Paris, and Malmaison. The numerous plants of the volador, now seen in  hot-houses, owe their origin to the only tree of the kind found near  Mariara. The geographical distribution of the different species of  gyrocarpus, which Mr. Brown considers as one of the laurineae, is very  singular. Jacquin saw one species near Carthagena in America.* (* The  Gyrocarpus Jacquini of Gartner, or Gyrocarpus americanus of  Willdenouw.) This is the same which we met with again in Mexico, near  Zumpango, on the road from Acapulco to the capital.* (* The natives of  Mexico called it quitlacoctli. I saw some of its young leaves with  three and five lobes; the full-grown leaves are in the form of a  heart, and always with three lobes. We never met with the volador in  flower.) Another species, which grows on the mountains of Coromandel,*  (* This is the Gyrocarpus asiaticus of Willdenouw.) has been described  by Roxburgh; the third and fourth* grow in the southern hemisphere, on  the coasts of Australia. (* Gyrocarpus sphenopterus, and G. rugosus.)    After getting out of the bath, while, half-wrapped in a sheet, we were  drying ourselves in the sun, according to the custom of the country, a  little man of the mulatto race approached us. After bowing gravely, he  made us a long speech on the virtues of the waters of Mariara,  adverting to the numbers of invalids by whom they have been visited  for some years past, and to the favourable situation of the springs,  between the two towns Valencia and Caracas. He showed us his house, a  little hut covered with palm-leaves, situated in an enclosure at a  small distance, on the bank of a rivulet, communicating with the bath.  He assured us that we should there find all the conveniences of life;  nails to suspend our hammocks, ox-leather to stretch over benches made  of reeds, earthern vases always filled with cool water, and what,  after the bath, would be most salutary of all, those great lizards  (iguanas), the flesh of which is known to be a refreshing aliment. We  judged from his harangue, that this good man took us for invalids, who  had come to stay near the spring. His counsels and offers of  hospitality were not altogether disinterested. He styled himself the  inspector of the waters, and the pulpero* (* Proprietor of a pulperia,  or little shop where refreshments are sold.) of the place. Accordingly  all his obliging attentions to us ceased as soon as he heard that we  had come merely to satisfy our curiosity; or as they express it in the  Spanish colonies, those lands of idleness, para ver, no mas, to see,  and nothing more. The waters of Mariara are used with success in  rheumatic swellings, and affections of the skin. As the waters are but  very feebly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, it is necessary to  bathe at the spot where the springs issue. Farther on, these same  waters are employed for the irrigation of fields of indigo. A wealthy  landed proprietor of Mariara, Don Domingo Tovar, had formed the  project of erecting a bathing-house, and an establishment which would  furnish visitors with better resources than lizard's flesh for food,  and leather stretched on a bench for their repose.    On the 21st of February, in the evening, we set out from the beautiful  Hacienda de Cura for Guacara and Nueva Valencia. We preferred  travelling by night, on account of the excessive heat of the day. We  passed by the hamlet of Punta Zamuro, at the foot of the high  mountains of Las Viruelas. The road is bordered with large  zamang-trees, or mimosas, the trunks of which rise to sixty feet high.  Their branches, nearly horizontal, meet at more than one hundred and  fifty feet distance. I have nowhere seen a vault of verdure more  beautiful and luxuriant. The night was gloomy: the Rincon del Diablo  with its denticulated rocks appeared from time to time at a distance,  illumined by the burning of the savannahs, or wrapped in ruddy smoke.  At the spot where the bushes were thickest, our horses were frightened  by the yell of an animal that seemed to follow us closely. It was a  large jaguar, which had roamed for three years among these mountains.  He had constantly escaped the pursuits of the boldest hunters, and had  carried off horses and mules from the midst of enclosures; but, having  no want of food, had not yet attacked men. The negro who conducted us  uttered wild cries, expecting by these means to frighten the tiger;  but his efforts were ineffectual. The jaguar, like the wolf of Europe,  follows travellers even when he will not attack them; the wolf in the  open fields and in unsheltered places, the jaguar skirting the road  and appearing only at intervals between the bushes.    We passed the day on the 23rd in the house of the Marquis de Toro, at  the village of Guacara, a very considerable Indian community. An  avenue of carolineas leads from Guacara to Mocundo. It was the first  time I had seen in the open air this majestic plant, which forms one  of the principal ornaments of the extensive conservatories of  Schonbrunn.* (* Every tree of the Carolinea princeps at Schonbrunn has  sprung from seeds collected from one single tree of enormous size,  near Chacao, east of Caracas.) Mocundo is a rich plantation of  sugar-canes, belonging to the family of Toro. We there find, what is  so rare in that country, a garden, artificial clumps of trees, and on  the border of the water, upon a rock of gneiss, a pavilion with a  mirador, or belvidere. The view is delightful over the western part of  the lake, the surrounding mountains, and a forest of palm-trees that  separates Guacara from the city of Nueva Valencia. The fields of  sugar-cane, from the soft verdure of the young reeds, resemble a vast  meadow. Everything denotes abundance; but it is at the price of the  liberty of the cultivators. At Mocundo, with two hundred and thirty  negroes, seventy-seven tablones, or cane-fields, are cultivated, each  of which, ten thousand varas square,* (* A tablon, equal to 1849  square toises, contains nearly an acre and one-fifth: a legal acre has  1344 square toises, and 1.95 legal acre is equal to one hectare.)  yields a net profit of two hundred or two hundred and forty piastres  a-year. The creole cane and the cane of Otaheite* are planted in the  month of April, the first at four, the second at five feet distance.  (* In the island of Palma, where in the latitude of 29 degrees the  sugar-cane is said to be cultivated as high as 140 toises above the  level of the Atlantic, the Otaheite cane requires more heat than the  Creole cane.) The cane ripens in fourteen months. It flowers in the  month of October, if the plant be sufficiently vigorous; but the top  is cut off before the panicle unfolds. In all the monocotyledonous  plants (for example, the maguey cultivated at Mexico for extracting  pulque, the wine-yielding palm-tree, and the sugar-cane), the  flowering alters the quality of the juices. The preparation of sugar,  the boiling, and the claying, are very imperfect in Terra Firma,  because it is made only for home consumption; and for wholesale,  papelon is preferred to sugar, either refined or raw. This papelon is  an impure sugar, in the form of little loaves, of a yellow-brown  colour. It contains a mixture of molasses and mucilaginous matter. The  poorest man eats papelon, as in Europe he eats cheese. It is believed  to have nutritive qualities. Fermented with water it yields the  guarapo, the favourite beverage of the people. In the province of  Caracas subcarbonate of potash is used, instead of lime, to purify the  juice of the sugar-cane. The ashes of the bucare, which is the  Erythrina corallodendrum, are preferred.    The sugar-cane was introduced very late, probably towards the end of  the sixteenth century, from the West India Islands, into the valleys  of Aragua. It was known in India, in China, and in all the islands of  the Pacific, from the most remote antiquity; and it was planted at  Khorassan, in Persia, as early as the fifth century of our era, in  order to obtain from it solid sugar.* (* The Indian name for the  sugar-cane is sharkara. Thence the word sugar.) The Arabs carried this  reed, so useful to the inhabitants of hot and temperate countries, to  the shores of the Mediterranean. In 1306, its cultivation was yet  unknown in Sicily; but was already common in the island of Cyprus, at  Rhodes, and in the Morea. A hundred years after it enriched Calabria,  Sicily, and the coasts of Spain. From Sicily the Infante Don Henry  transported the cane to Madeira: from Madeira it passed to the Canary  Islands, where it was entirely unknown; for the ferulae of Juba, quae  expressae liquorem fundunt potui ucundum, are euphorbias (the Tabayba  dulce), and not, as has been recently asserted,* sugar-canes. (* On  the origin of cane-sugar, in the Journal de Pharmacie 1816 page 387.  The Tabayba dulce is, according to Von Buch, the Euphorbia  balsamifera, the juice of which is neither corrosive nor bitter like  that of the cardon, or Euphorbia canariensis.) Twelve  sugar-manufactories (ingenios de azucar) were soon established in the  island of Great Canary, in that of Palma, and between Adexe, Icod, and  Guarachico, in the island of Teneriffe. Negroes were employed in this  cultivation, and their descendants still inhabit the grottos of  Tiraxana, in the Great Canary. Since the sugar-cane has been  transplanted to the West Indies, and the New World has given maize to  the Canaries, the cultivation of the latter has taken the place of the  cane at Teneriffe and the Great Canary. The cane is now found only in  the island of Palma, near Argual and Tazacorte,* where it yields  scarcely one thousand quintals of sugar a year.

Since the day when Honen Shonin appeared in the world, and set  forth the single Ark of the Divine Promise, hath the Doctrine of the  Pure Land gloriously shone upon the hearts of all men in the land of  Nihon.    215. For from the strength of the wisdom of light, Honen, the Great  Teacher, came into the world and hath taught the chosen doctrine of  the Divine Promise, and he hath built Jodo-Shinshu upon the rock.    216. Though Zendo and Genshin, those great teachers, have well  instructed us, yet had Honen Shonin kept silence, wherewith should  we know the holy teaching of Shin-Shu, we who dwell in remote  country and in an evil day?    217. Throughout the long, long Kalpas of my lives that are overpast  could I never find the way of Deliverance, and if Honen Shonin, the  Great Teacher, had not arisen in this world, vainly had I spent the  precious hours of my life.    218. When his years were but fifteen, Honen Shonin entered into the  Way of Illumination, for in departing from worldly life he fulfilled  his heart's desire, and by him was clearly understanded the doctrine  of the transience of life.    219. The excellent righteousness of Honen Shonin, his deeds and the  wisdom that was in him, drew unto him for refuge many even of chief  priests of the heretics that seek Nirvana through the way of the  sages. Yea, they sought him even as their appointed teacher, radiant  and stray of soul as the diamond.    220. Even while Honen Shonin yet walked in this world, there issued  from his body rays of a golden shining, and this, so it is said,  hath Kanezane Fujiwara beheld with his own eyes.    221. The people passed it from mouth to mouth that this Honen Shonin  was the living incarnation of Doshaku Zenji, or yet again of Zendo  Daishi.    222. Before the eyes of men Honen Shonin stood as the Boddhisattva  of Wisdom, or, yet more, as the Blessed One again made flesh.    The Emperor and all his ministers did homage unto him, yea, and the  men of the chief city and of the far countries.    223. He who had been Emperor, in the time of Jokyu, brought homage  to Honen Shonin. All the priests and scholars of the word of  Confucius had understanding of the doctrine of Shin Shu.    224. A chosen vessel of the Blessed One that men might be saved,  Honen Shonin was manifested in the world, and he opened wide the  gate of perfect wisdom, having instructed mankind in the Holy Faith.    225. Of all rare things it is the rarest that we should ourselves  meet with the True Teacher, yet verily the chain of doubt in the  Divine Mercy is the true cause of unending birth and death.    226. Honen Shonin issued forth from the mysterious Light and his  disciples beheld it. In his eyes was there nought of disparity  between the wise and them that know not, between the noble and the  lowly born.    227. And now, his time being at hand, Honen Shonin spake:    \"Thrice have I taken birth in the Land of Purity, and of these three  times the last hath given unto me the fullness of peace.\"    228. Once did Honen Shonin speak, saying: \"In the glorious day of  our Lord was I among the holy Assemblage on the Peak of Vultures,  and my Spirit was rapt in self-instruction and in the doctrine of  salvation.\"    229. Having taken birth in that small and remote island, Honen  Shonin spread abroad the doctrine of the Holy Name for the sake of  all men's salvation. And thus had he done not only then, but many  times in ages gone by.    230. That Buddha, whose light is infinite, was made flesh in this  world as Honen Shonin, and when his merciful work was accomplished,  he returned into the Land of Purity.    231. When his life was drawing to a close, light was manifested  about him as a cloud of glory, yea, and music of the heavenly  places, sweet and excelling in harmony, and sweet odours scattered  about him.    232. Following steadfastly after the ensample of the Nirvana of the  Lord, he laid himself upon his right side, his head inclined unto  the north, his face turned unto the west. And the crowding people  attended upon him, even the priests and men and women of the nobles  and of the lowly born.    233. Now the time when Honen Shonin departed from this life was the  twenty-fifth day of the young spring. In the second year of  Kenriyaku he returned in peace unto the Land of the Father.    On the ninth day of February and the second of Ko-Yen, the  revelation that here followeth was sent unto me in a dream of  morning.    234. It is necessary that men should believe the divine promise of  Him who is Infinite.    Whoso believeth shall attain unto Perfect Wisdom, by the virtue of  that Light which embraceth him and shall never forsake him.      OF THE THREE PERIODS    235. Two thousand years and yet more are departed since the day when  our Lord entered into Nirvana. Ended are the two glorious  periods--the orthodox and the representative. Lament, O ye  disciples, who in this closing age would follow after the Lord.    236. The teachings of our Lord have entered into the Dragon Palace,  for in this closing age they are too high for men. Men are impotent  to follow after their practice or to attain unto them.    237. Throughout the three periods hath the Divine Promise of the  Buddha of Infinite Light prospered and grown. But in this period of  the closing age all righteous deeds are hidden within the Dragon  Palace.    238. In a certain Sutra are we thus instructed, since the age that  now is a part of the fifth in this closing age wherein men are fast  bound in warfare, all righteous deeds have disappeared from the  world.    239. Since the ancient days the life of men, whose age counted as  80,000 years, hath declined and lessened. And when they could live  but 20,000 years, they were men living in an evil world, and with  the five signs of degeneration upon them.    240. And since time itself hath decayed, the bodily frame of man  hath waxed smaller and feebler, and they are as furious serpents or  as wicked dragons, for the decay of time worketh within them.    241. The illusion that is bred of ignorance increaseth, and is  driven over the world like dust. Hatred great and unbreakable as  the high mountains is in the stead of love.    242. The perversity of man is as strong and piercing as the thorn of  the jungle. With eyes of suspicion and venomous anger do they accuse  and persecute them who believe upon the Holy Name.    243. It is a mark of the degeneration of time that man's life is  brief and death cometh upon him early and with iron hands breaketh  up his body and that which surrounds him wherein he dwelleth. And  they who leaving justice turn to wickedness do destroy one another  by their evil deeds.    244. No hope is there that the men now living in these last days  shall escape the fetters of birth and death if they refuse the  merciful promise of the Blessed One.    245. Of heretics in the faith are there ninety sorts that defile the  world and only the teaching of the Enlightened One cleanseth it. By  him alone that attaineth unto wisdom shall true joy to man be  fulfilled according to nature and in peace.    246. In these last times of decay the priests, together with the  people, do evil unto him that trusteth in the doctrine of the Holy  name.    247. Whoso attaineth not unto wisdom is eager to harm that man who,  with single heart, accepted the exalted promise. There is no end to  the infinity of the ocean of birth and death for those men who raven  to destroy the doctrine that is mighty to save them if they would  have it so.    248. Though the days of our present time are those that are called  orthodox, we, in whom ignorance is fulfilled, have not within us the  heart that is pure and true. How, then, can we of our own help  attain unto the deeds that shall gain the wisdom that is made  perfect.    249. The strong heart that is able to attain unto wisdom by  self-help is beyond human knowledge and speech. How is it possible  that men full of ignorance, fettered unto birth and death, should  possess such a heart.    250. Though we were masters of the strong will of self-effort, even  should we have seen face to face the Buddhas, myriad as the sands of  Ganges--they who in this world were manifested the one after the  other, yet were we drifted on the torrent of birth and death, in  self-effort were no rescue for us.    251. In these sinful days that are called the representative and  last times all the teachings of the Lord Buddha, the Sakiya-Muni  have vanished away, but the Divine Promise of the Buddha of Infinite  Light, shining greatly over the world, prosperously leads mankind  unto the Eternal Kingdom.    252. After choice that is peerless and beyond the world's  understanding, after five Kalpas of musing, the Blessed One builded  up the Divine Promise of the Light and Life Infinite. And this is  the Essence of His Mercy showed upon us.    253. The noble mind that shall attain unto wisdom in the doctrine of  the Pure Land is the mind that fain would become Buddha, and it is  named: \"The mind that shall save men who suffer.\"    254. The mind that shall save men is that mind given by the high  promise of the Blessed One. Whoso attaineth unto the faith He  giveth shall be lord of the great Nirvana.    255. Whoso attaineth unto the mind that would fain become Buddha,  having sought refuge in the gift of the Blessed One, hath no term in  his own gift of welfare to mankind, having for ever laid down all  self-righteousness.    256. According to the all-seeing promise of the Blessed One when the  water of the faith He giveth entereth the soul, illusion passeth  straight-way into wisdom through the virtue of that true land of the  Divine Promise.    257. That man who trusteth in the two gifts granted by the Buddha of  Infinite Light, is raised up into the sphere of the Lesser  Enlightenment, and thence hath he the heart that dwelleth always on  the perfection of the Blessed One.    258.
