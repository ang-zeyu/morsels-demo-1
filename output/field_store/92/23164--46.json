Azerbaijan's  oil production declined through 1997 but has registered an increase  every year since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements  (PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to  oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to spur future  industrial development.  Oil production under the first of these PSAs,  with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November  1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet  republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,  but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects.  Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and  old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle  to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment in the  non-energy sector, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the  Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet  republics is declining in importance while trade is building with Turkey  and the nations of Europe.  Long-term prospects will depend on world oil  prices, the location of new pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's  ability to manage its oil wealth.

At this time, he was by far the most influential person of the state.  The Duke of Orleans had so much confidence in his sagacity, and the  success of his plans, that he always consulted him upon every matter  of moment. He was by no means unduly elevated by his prosperity, but  remained the same simple, affable, sensible man that he had shown  himself in adversity. His gallantry, which was always delightful to the  fair objects of it, was of a nature, so kind, so gentlemanly, and so  respectful, that not even a lover could have taken offence at it. If  upon any occasion he showed any symptoms of haughtiness, it was to the  cringing nobles, who lavished their adulation upon him till it became  fulsome. He often took pleasure in seeing how long he could make them  dance attendance upon him for a single favour. To such of his own  countrymen as by chance visited Paris, and sought an interview with him,  he was, on the contrary, all politeness and attention. When Archibald  Campbell, Earl of Islay, and afterwards Duke of Argyle, called upon him  in the Place Vendome, he had to pass through an ante-chamber crowded  with persons of the first distinction, all anxious to see the great  financier, and have their names put down as first on the list of some  new subscription. Law himself was quietly sitting in his library,  writing a letter to the gardener at his paternal estate of Lauriston  about the planting of some cabbages! The Earl stayed for a considerable  time, played a game of piquet with his countryman, and left him, charmed  with his ease, good sense, and good breeding.    Among the nobles who, by means of the public credulity at this time,  gained sums sufficient to repair their ruined fortunes, may be mentioned  the names of the Dukes de Bourbon, de Guiche, de la Force [The Duke de  la Force gained considerable sums, not only by jobbing in the stocks,  but in dealing in porcelain, spices, &c. It was debated for a length of  time in the Parliament of Paris whether he had not, in his quality of  spice-merchant, forfeited his rank in the peerage. It was decided in  the negative. A caricature of him was made, dressed as a street porter,  carrying a large bale of spices on his back, with the inscription,  \"Admirez La Force.\"], de Chaulnes, and d'Antin; the Marechal d'Estrees,  the Princes de Rohan, de Poix, and de Leon. The Duke de Bourbon, son  of Louis XIV by Madame de Montespan, was peculiarly fortunate in his  speculations in Mississippi paper. He rebuilt the royal residence of  Chantilly in a style of unwonted magnificence, and, being passionately  fond of horses, he erected a range of stables, which were long renowned  throughout Europe, and imported a hundred and fifty of the finest racers  from England, to improve the breed in France. He bought a large extent  of country in Picardy, and became possessed of nearly all the valuable  lands lying between the Oise and the Somme.    When fortunes such as these were gained, it is no wonder that Law should  have been almost worshipped by the mercurial population. Never was  monarch more flattered than he was. All the small poets and litterateurs  of the day poured floods of adulation upon him. According to them he was  the saviour of the country, the tutelary divinity of France; wit was in  all his words, goodness in all his looks, and wisdom in all his actions.  So great a crowd followed his carriage whenever he went abroad, that the  Regent sent him a troop of horse as his permanent escort, to clear the  streets before him.    It was remarked at this time, that Paris had never before been so full  of objects of elegance and luxury. Statues, pictures, and tapestries  were imported in great quantities from foreign countries, and found  a ready market. All those pretty trifles in the way of furniture and  ornament which the French excel in manufacturing, were no longer the  exclusive play-things of the aristocracy, but were to be found in  abundance in the houses of traders and the middle classes in general.  Jewellery of the most costly description was brought to Paris as the  most favourable mart. Among the rest, the famous diamond, bought by  the Regent, and called by his name, and which long adorned the crown of  France. It was purchased for the sum of two millions of livres, under  circumstances which show that the Regent was not so great a gainer as  some of his subjects, by the impetus which trade had received. When  the diamond was first offered to him, he refused to buy it, although he  desired, above all things, to possess it, alleging as his reason, that  his duty to the country he governed would not allow him to spend  so large a sum of the public money for a mere jewel. This valid and  honourable excuse threw all the ladies of the court into alarm, and  nothing was heard for some days but expressions of regret, that so rare  a gem should be allowed to go out of France; no private individual being  rich enough to buy it. The Regent was continually importuned about it;  but all in vain, until the Duke de St. Simon, who, with all his ability,  was something of a twaddler, undertook the weighty business. His  entreaties, being seconded by Law, the good-natured Regent gave his  consent, leaving to Law's ingenuity to find the means to pay for it. The  owner took security for the payment of the sum of two millions of livres  within a stated period, receiving, in the mean time, the interest of  five per cent. upon that amount, and being allowed, besides, all the  valuable clippings of the gem. St. Simon, in his Memoirs, relates, with  no little complacency, his share in this transaction. After describing  the diamond to be as large as a greengage, of a form nearly round,  perfectly white, and without flaw, and weighing more than five hundred  grains, he concludes with a chuckle, by telling the world, \"that he  takes great credit to himself for having induced the Regent to make  so illustrious a purchase.\" In other words, he was proud that he had  induced him to sacrifice his duty, and buy a bauble for himself, at an  extravagant price, out of the public money.    Thus the system continued to flourish till the commencement of the year  1720. The warnings of the Parliament, that too great a creation of paper  money would, sooner or later, bring the country to bankruptcy, were  disregarded. The Regent, who knew nothing whatever of the philosophy  of finance, thought that a system which had produced such good effects  could never be carried to excess. If five hundred millions of paper had  been of such advantage, five hundred millions additional would be of  still greater advantage. This was the grand error of the Regent, and  which Law did not attempt to dispel. The extraordinary avidity of the  people kept up the delusion; and the higher the price of Indian and  Mississippi stock, the more billets de banque were issued to keep pace  with it. The edifice thus reared might not unaptly be compared to the  gorgeous palace erected by Potemkin, that princely barbarian of Russia,  to surprise and please his imperial mistress: huge blocks of ice were  piled one upon another; ionic pillars, of chastest workmanship, in ice,  formed a noble portico; and a dome, of the same material, shone in the  sun, which had just strength enough to gild, but not to melt it. It  glittered afar, like a palace of crystals and diamonds; but there came  one warm breeze from the south, and the stately building dissolved away,  till none were able even to gather up the fragments. So with Law and his  paper system. No sooner did the breath of popular mistrust blow steadily  upon it, than it fell to ruins, and none could raise it up again.    The first slight alarm that was occasioned was early in 1720. The Prince  de Conti, offended that Law should have denied him fresh shares in India  stock, at his own price, sent to his bank to demand payment in specie  of so enormous a quantity of notes, that three waggons were required for  its transport. Law complained to the Regent, and urged on his attention  the mischief that would be done, if such an example found many  imitators. The Regent was but too well aware of it, and, sending for the  Prince de Conti, ordered him, under penalty of his high displeasure, to  refund to the Bank two-thirds of the specie which he had withdrawn from  it. The Prince was forced to obey the despotic mandate. Happily for  Law's credit, De Conti was an unpopular man: everybody condemned his  meanness and cupidity, and agreed that Law had been hardly treated. It  is strange, however, that so narrow an escape should not have made both  Law and the Regent more anxious to restrict their issues. Others were  soon found who imitated, from motives of distrust, the example which had  been set by De Conti in revenge. The more acute stockjobbers imagined  justly that prices could not continue to rise for ever. Bourdon and  La Richardiere, renowned for their extensive operations in the funds,  quietly and in small quantities at a time, converted their notes into  specie, and sent it away to foreign countries. They also bought as much  as they could conveniently carry of plate and expensive jewellery, and  sent it secretly away to England or to Holland. Vermalet, a jobber, who  sniffed the coming storm, procured gold and silver coin to the amount  of nearly a million of livres, which he packed in a farmer's cart, and  covered over with hay and cow-dung. He then disguised himself in the  dirty smock-frock, or blouse, of a peasant, and drove his precious load  in safety into Belgium. From thence he soon found means to transport it  to Amsterdam.    Hitherto no difficulty had been experienced by any class in procuring  specie for their wants. But this system could not long be carried on  without causing a scarcity. The voice of complaint was heard on every  side, and inquiries being"]]]
