They also bring the good tidings that  General Saxton is not to be removed, as had been reported.    Two different stands of colors have arrived for us, and will be  presented at New Year's,--one from friends in New York, and the other  from a lady in Connecticut. I see that \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated  Weekly\" of December 20th has a highly imaginative picture of the  muster-in of our first company, and also of a skirmish on the late  expedition.    I must not forget the prayer overheard last night by one of the  captains: \"O Lord! when I tink ob dis Kismas and las' year de Kismas.  Las' Kismas he in de Secesh, and notin' to eat but grits, and no salt  in 'em. Dis year in de camp, and too much victual!\" This \"too much\" is  a favorite phrase out of their grateful hearts, and did not in this case  denote an excess of dinner,--as might be supposed,--but of thanksgiving.      December 29.    Our new surgeon has begun his work most efficiently: he and the chaplain  have converted an old gin-house into a comfortable hospital, with ten  nice beds and straw pallets. He is now, with a hearty professional  faith, looking round for somebody to put into it. I am afraid the  regiment will accommodate him; for, although he declares that these men  do not sham sickness, as he expected, their catarrh is an unpleasant  reality. They feel the dampness very much, and make such a coughing  at dress-parade, that I have urged him to administer a dose of  cough-mixture, all round, just before that pageant. Are the colored  race _tough?_ is my present anxiety; and it is odd that physical  insufficiency, the only discouragement not thrown in our way by the  newspapers, is the only discouragement which finds any place in our  minds. They are used to sleeping indoors in winter, herded before fires,  and so they feel the change. Still, the regiment is as healthy as the  average, and experience will teach us something.*    * A second winter's experience removed all this solicitude, for they  learned to take care of themselves. During the first February the  sick-list averaged about ninety, during the second about thirty, this  being the worst month in the year for blacks.      December 30.    On the first of January we are to have a slight collation, ten oxen or  so, barbecued,--or not properly barbecued, but roasted whole. Touching  the length of time required to \"do\" an ox, no two housekeepers appear  to agree. Accounts vary from two hours to twenty-four. We shall happily  have enough to try all gradations of roasting, and suit all tastes, from  Miss A.'s to mine. But fancy me proffering a spare-rib, well done, to  some fair lady! What ever are we to do for spoons and forks and plates?  Each soldier has his own, and is sternly held responsible for it by  \"Army Regulations.\" But how provide for the multitude? Is it customary,  I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers? Fortunately, the  Major is to see to that department. Great are the advantages of military  discipline: for anything perplexing, detail a subordinate.      New Year's Eve.    My housekeeping at home is not, perhaps, on any very extravagant scale.  Buying beefsteak, I usually go to the extent of two or three pounds. Yet  when, this morning at daybreak, the quartermaster called to inquire how  many cattle I would have killed for roasting, I turned over in bed, and  answered composedly, \"Ten,--and keep three to be fatted.\"    Fatted, quotha! Not one of the beasts at present appears to possess  an ounce of superfluous flesh. Never were seen such lean kine. As they  swing on vast spits, composed of young trees, the firelight glimmers  through their ribs, as if they were great lanterns. But no matter, they  are cooking,--nay, they are cooked.    One at least is taken off to cool, and will be replaced tomorrow to warm  up. It was roasted three hours, and well done, for I tasted it. It is  so long since I tasted fresh beef that forgetfulness is possible; but  I fancied this to be successful. I tried to imagine that I liked  the Homeric repast, and certainly the whole thing has been far more  agreeable than was to be expected. The doubt now is, whether I have made  a sufficient provision for my household. I should have roughly guessed  that ten beeves would feed as many million people, it has such a  stupendous sound; but General Saxton predicts a small social party of  five thousand, and we fear that meat will run short, unless they prefer  bone. One of the cattle is so small, we are hoping it may turn out veal.    For drink we aim at the simple luxury of molasses-and-water, a barrel  per company, ten in all. Liberal housekeepers may like to know that for  a barrel of water we allow three gallons of molasses, half a pound of  ginger, and a quart of vinegar,--this last being a new ingredient for my  untutored palate, though all the rest are amazed at my ignorance.  Hard bread, with more molasses, and a dessert of tobacco, complete the  festive repast, destined to cheer, but not inebriate.    On this last point, of inebriation, this is certainly a wonderful camp.  For us it is absolutely omitted from the list of vices. I have never  heard of a glass of liquor in the camp, nor of any effort either to  bring it in or to keep it out. A total absence of the circulating medium  might explain the abstinence,--not that it seems to have that effect  with white soldiers,--but it would not explain the silence. The craving  for tobacco is constant, and not to be allayed, like that of a mother  for her children; but I have never heard whiskey even wished for, save  on Christmas-Day, and then only by one man, and he spoke with a hopeless  ideal sighing, as one alludes to the Golden Age. I am amazed at this  total omission of the most inconvenient of all camp appetites. It  certainly is not the result of exhortation, for there has been no  occasion for any, and even the pledge would scarcely seem efficacious  where hardly anybody can write.    I do not think there is a great visible eagerness for tomorrow's  festival: it is not their way to be very jubilant over anything this  side of the New Jerusalem. They know also that those in this Department  are nominally free already, and that the practical freedom has to be  maintained, in any event, by military success. But they will enjoy it  greatly, and we shall have a multitude of people.      January 1, 1863 (evening).    A happy New Year to civilized people,--mere white folks. Our festival  has come and gone, with perfect success, and our good General has been  altogether satisfied. Last night the great fires were kept smouldering  in the pit, and the beeves were cooked more or less, chiefly  more,--during which time they had to be carefully watched, and the  great spits turned by main force. Happy were the merry fellows who were  permitted to sit up all night, and watch the glimmering flames that  threw a thousand fantastic shadows among the great gnarled oaks. And  such a chattering as I was sure to hear whenever I awoke that night!    My first greeting to-day was from one of the most stylish sergeants, who  approached me with the following little speech, evidently the result of  some elaboration:--    \"I tink myself happy, dis New Year's Day, for salute my own Cunnel.  Dis day las' year I was servant to a Gunnel ob Secesh; but now I hab de  privilege for salute my own Cunnel.\"    That officer, with the utmost sincerity, reciprocated the sentiment.    About ten o'clock the people began to collect by land, and also by  water,--in steamers sent by General Saxton for the purpose; and from  that time all the avenues of approach were thronged. The multitude were  chiefly colored women, with gay handkerchiefs on their heads, and a  sprinkling of men, with that peculiarly respectable look which these  people always have on Sundays and holidays. There were many white  visitors also,--ladies on horseback and in carriages, superintendents  and teachers, officers, and cavalry-men. Our companies were marched to  the neighborhood of the platform, and allowed to sit or stand, as at the  Sunday services; the platform was occupied by ladies and dignitaries,  and by the band of the Eighth Maine, which kindly volunteered for the  occasion; the colored people filled up all the vacant openings in the  beautiful grove around, and there was a cordon of mounted visitors  beyond. Above, the great live-oak branches and their trailing moss;  beyond the people, a glimpse of the blue river.    The services began at half past eleven o'clock, with prayer by our  chaplain, Mr. Fowler, who is always, on such occasions, simple,  reverential, and impressive. Then the President's Proclamation was  read by Dr. W. H. Brisbane, a thing infinitely appropriate, a South  Carolinian addressing South Carolinians; for he was reared among these  very islands, and here long since emancipated his own slaves. Then  the colors were presented to us by the Rev. Mr. French, a chaplain who  brought them from the donors in New York. All this was according to the  programme. Then followed an incident so simple, so touching, so utterly  unexpected and startling, that I can scarcely believe it on recalling,  though it gave the keynote to the whole day. The very moment the speaker  had ceased, and just as I took and waved the flag, which now for the  first time meant anything to these poor people, there suddenly arose,  close beside the platform, a strong male voice (but rather cracked and  elderly), into which two women's voices instantly blended, singing, as  if by an impulse that could no more be repressed than the morning note  of the song-sparrow.--      \"My Country, 'tis of thee,    Sweet land of liberty,    Of thee I sing!\"    People looked at each other, and then at us on the platform, to see  whence came this interruption, not set down in the bills.

Therefore the Egyptians looked long for his return, but in vain, and  worshipped him as a hero, and made a statue of him in Chemmis, which  stood for many a hundred years; and they said that he appeared to them at  times, with sandals a cubit long; and that whenever he appeared the  season was fruitful, and the Nile rose high that year.    Then Perseus went to the eastward, along the Red Sea shore; and then,  because he was afraid to go into the Arabian deserts, he turned northward  once more, and this time no storm hindered him.    He went past the Isthmus, and Mount Casius, and the vast Serbonian bog,  and up the shore of Palestine, where the dark-faced AEthiops dwelt.    He flew on past pleasant hills and valleys, like Argos itself, or  Lacedaemon, or the fair Vale of Tempe.  But the lowlands were all drowned  by floods, and the highlands blasted by fire, and the hills heaved like a  babbling cauldron, before the wrath of King Poseidon, the shaker of the  earth.    And Perseus feared to go inland, but flew along the shore above the sea;  and he went on all the day, and the sky was black with smoke; and he went  on all the night, and the sky was red with flame.    And at the dawn of day he looked toward the cliffs; and at the water's  edge, under a black rock, he saw a white image stand.    'This,' thought he, 'must surely be the statue of some sea-God; I will go  near and see what kind of Gods these barbarians worship.'    So he came near; but when he came, it was no statue, but a maiden of  flesh and blood; for he could see her tresses streaming in the breeze;  and as he came closer still, he could see how she shrank and shivered  when the waves sprinkled her with cold salt spray.  Her arms were spread  above her head, and fastened to the rock with chains of brass; and her  head drooped on her bosom, either with sleep, or weariness, or grief.  But now and then she looked up and wailed, and called her mother; yet she  did not see Perseus, for the cap of darkness was on his head.                         [Picture: Perseus and the maid]    Full of pity and indignation, Perseus drew near and looked upon the maid.  Her cheeks were darker than his were, and her hair was blue-black like a  hyacinth; but Perseus thought, 'I have never seen so beautiful a maiden;  no, not in all our isles.  Surely she is a king's daughter.  Do  barbarians treat their kings' daughters thus?  She is too fair, at least,  to have done any wrong I will speak to her.'    And, lifting the hat from his head, he flashed into her sight.  She  shrieked with terror, and tried to hide her face with her hair, for she  could not with her hands; but Perseus cried--    'Do not fear me, fair one; I am a Hellen, and no barbarian.  What cruel  men have bound you?  But first I will set you free.'    And he tore at the fetters, but they were too strong for him; while the  maiden cried--    'Touch me not; I am accursed, devoted as a victim to the sea-Gods.  They  will slay you, if you dare to set me free.'    'Let them try,' said Perseus; and drawing, Herpe from his thigh, he cut  through the brass as if it had been flax.    'Now,' he said, 'you belong to me, and not to these sea-Gods, whosoever  they may be!'  But she only called the more on her mother.    'Why call on your mother?  She can be no mother to have left you here.  If a bird is dropped out of the nest, it belongs to the man who picks it  up.  If a jewel is cast by the wayside, it is his who dare win it and  wear it, as I will win you and will wear you.  I know now why Pallas  Athene sent me hither.  She sent me to gain a prize worth all my toil and  more.'    And he clasped her in his arms, and cried, 'Where are these sea-Gods,  cruel and unjust, who doom fair maids to death?  I carry the weapons of  Immortals.  Let them measure their strength against mine!  But tell me,  maiden, who you are, and what dark fate brought you here.'    And she answered, weeping--    'I am the daughter of Cepheus, King of Iopa, and my mother is Cassiopoeia  of the beautiful tresses, and they called me Andromeda, as long as life  was mine.  And I stand bound here, hapless that I am, for the  sea-monster's food, to atone for my mother's sin.  For she boasted of me  once that I was fairer than Atergatis, Queen of the Fishes; so she in her  wrath sent the sea-floods, and her brother the Fire King sent the  earthquakes, and wasted all the land, and after the floods a monster bred  of the slime, who devours all living things.  And now he must devour me,  guiltless though I am--me who never harmed a living thing, nor saw a fish  upon the shore but I gave it life, and threw it back into the sea; for in  our land we eat no fish, for fear of Atergatis their queen.  Yet the  priests say that nothing but my blood can atone for a sin which I never  committed.'    But Perseus laughed, and said, 'A sea-monster?  I have fought with worse  than him: I would have faced Immortals for your sake; how much more a  beast of the sea?'    Then Andromeda looked up at him, and new hope was kindled in her breast,  so proud and fair did he stand, with one hand round her, and in the other  the glittering sword.  But she only sighed, and wept the more, and  cried--    'Why will you die, young as you are?  Is there not death and sorrow  enough in the world already?  It is noble for me to die, that I may save  the lives of a whole people; but you, better than them all, why should I  slay you too?  Go you your way; I must go mine.'    But Perseus cried, 'Not so; for the Lords of Olympus, whom I serve, are  the friends of the heroes, and help them on to noble deeds.  Led by them,  I slew the Gorgon, the beautiful horror; and not without them do I come  hither, to slay this monster with that same Gorgon's head.  Yet hide your  eyes when I leave you, lest the sight of it freeze you too to stone.'    But the maiden answered nothing, for she could not believe his words.  And then, suddenly looking up, she pointed to the sea, and shrieked--    'There he comes, with the sunrise, as they promised.  I must die now.  How shall I endure it?  Oh, go!  Is it not dreadful enough to be torn  piecemeal, without having you to look on?'  And she tried to thrust him  away.    But he said, 'I go; yet promise me one thing ere I go: that if I slay  this beast you will be my wife, and come back with me to my kingdom in  fruitful Argos, for I am a king's heir.  Promise me, and seal it with a  kiss.'    Then she lifted up her face, and kissed him; and Perseus laughed for joy,  and flew upward, while Andromeda crouched trembling on the rock, waiting  for what might befall.    On came the great sea-monster, coasting along like a huge black galley,  lazily breasting the ripple, and stopping at times by creek or headland  to watch for the laughter of girls at their bleaching, or cattle pawing  on the sand-hills, or boys bathing on the beach.  His great sides were  fringed with clustering shells and sea-weeds, and the water gurgled in  and out of his wide jaws, as he rolled along, dripping and glistening in  the beams of the morning sun.    At last he saw Andromeda, and shot forward to take his prey, while the  waves foamed white behind him, and before him the fish fled leaping.    Then down from the height of the air fell Perseus like a shooting star;  down to the crests of the waves, while Andromeda hid her face as he  shouted; and then there was silence for a while.    At last she looked up trembling, and saw Perseus springing toward her;  and instead of the monster a long black rock, with the sea rippling  quietly round it.    Who then so proud as Perseus, as he leapt back to the rock, and lifted  his fair Andromeda in his arms, and flew with her to the cliff-top, as a  falcon carries a dove?    Who so proud as Perseus, and who so joyful as all the AEthiop people?  For they had stood watching the monster from the cliffs, wailing for the  maiden's fate.  And already a messenger had gone to Cepheus and  Cassiopoeia, where they sat in sackcloth and ashes on the ground, in the  innermost palace chambers, awaiting their daughter's end.  And they came,  and all the city with them, to see the wonder, with songs and with  dances, with cymbals and harps, and received their daughter back again,  as one alive from the dead.    Then Cepheus said, 'Hero of the Hellens, stay here with me and be my  son-in-law, and I will give you the half of my kingdom.'    'I will be your son-in-law,' said Perseus, 'but of your kingdom I will  have none, for I long after the pleasant land of Greece, and my mother  who waits for me at home.'    Then Cepheus said, 'You must not take my daughter away at once, for she  is to us like one alive from the dead.  Stay with us here a year, and  after that you shall return with honour.'  And Perseus consented; but  before he went to the palace he bade the people bring stones and wood,  and built three altars, one to Athene, and one to Hermes, and one to  Father Zeus, and offered bullocks and rams.    And some said, 'This is a pious man;' yet the priests said, 'The Sea  Queen will be yet more fierce against us, because her monster is slain.'  But they were afraid to speak aloud, for they feared the Gorgon's head.  So they went up to the palace; and when they came in, there stood in the  hall Phineus, the brother of Cepheus, chafing like a bear robbed of her  whelps, and with him his sons, and his servants, and many an armed man;  and he cried to Cepheus--    'You shall not marry your daughter to this stranger, of whom no one knows  even the name.  Was not Andromeda betrothed to my son?  And now she is  safe again, has he not a right to claim her?'    But Perseus laughed, and answered, 'If your son is in want of a bride,  let him save a maiden for himself.  As yet he seems but a helpless  bride-groom.  He left this one to die, and dead she is to him.  I saved  her alive, and alive she is to me, but to"]]]
