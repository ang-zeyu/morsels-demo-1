Or will you tell me this might do well enough for one of the common herd,  but you cannot have _me_ sheltering myself so? _I_ must not brief Homer;  it will not serve me to plead:      No mortal man e'er yet escaped his fate;    nor again,      His thread was spun, then when his mother bare him.    On the other hand, I might avoid that plea as wanting in plausibility,  and say that I did not accept this association under the temptation of  money or any prospects of that kind, but in pure admiration of the  wisdom, strength, and magnanimity of my patron's character, which  inspired the wish to partake his activity. But I fear I should only have  brought on myself the additional imputation of flattery. It would be a  case of 'one nail drives out one nail,' and this time the one left in  would be the bigger; for flattery is the most servile, and consequently  reckoned the worst, of all vices.    Both these pleas, then, being excluded, what is left me but to confess  that I have no sound defence to make? I have indeed one anchor yet  aboard: I may whine over age and ill health, and their attendant poverty,  from which a man will purchase escape at any cost. The situation tempts  me to send an invitation to Euripides's _Medea_: will she come and  recite certain lines of hers on my behalf, kindly making the slight  changes needed?--      Too well I know how monstrous is the deed;    My poverty, but not my will, consents.    And every one knows the place in Theognis, whether I quote it or not,  where he approves of people's flinging themselves to the unplumbed deep  from sky-pointing crags, if one may be quit of poverty that way.    That about exhausts the obvious lines of defence; and none of them is  very promising. But never fear, my friend, I am not going to try any of  them. May never Argos be so hard put to it that Cyllarabis must be sown!  nor ever I be in such straits for a tolerable defence as to be driven  upon these evasions! No, I only ask you to consider the vast difference  between being a hireling in a rich man's house, where one is a slave, and  must put up with all that is described in my book--between that and  entering the public service, doing one's best as an administrator, and  taking the Emperor's pay for it. Go fully into the matter; take the two  things separately and have a good look at them; you will find that they  are two octaves apart, as the musical people say; the two lives are about  as like each other as lead is to silver, bronze to gold, an anemone to a  rose, a monkey to a man; there is pay, and there is subordination, in  each case; but the essence of the two things is utterly different. In one  we have manifest slavery; the new-comers who accept the terms are barely  distinguishable from the human chattels a man has bought or bred; but  persons who have the management of public business, and give their  services to states and nations, are not to have insinuations aimed at  them just because they are paid; that single point of resemblance is not  to level them down to the others. If that is to be the principle, we had  better do away with all such offices at once; governors of whole  provinces, prefects of cities, commanders of legions and armies, will all  fall under the same condemnation; for they are paid. But of course  everything is not to be upset to suit a single case; all who receive pay  are not to be lumped together.    It is all a mistake; I never said that all drawers of salaries lived a  degraded life; I only pitied those domestic slaves who have been caught  by compliments on their culture. My position, you see, is entirely  different; my private relations are as they were before, though in a  public capacity I am now an active part of the great Imperial machine. If  you care to inquire, you will find that my charge is not the least  important in the government of Egypt. I control the cause-list, see that  trials are properly conducted, keep a record of all proceedings and  pleas, exercise censorship over forensic oratory, and edit the Emperor's  rescripts with a view to their official and permanent preservation in the  most lucid, accurate, and genuine form. My salary comes from no private  person, but from the Emperor; and it is considerable, amounting to many  hundreds. In the future too there is before _me_ the brilliant prospect of  attaining in due course to a governorship or other distinguished  employment.    Accordingly I am now going to throw off reserve, come to grips with the  charge against me, and prove my case _a fortiori_. I tell you that nobody  does anything for nothing; you may point to people in high places--as high  as you like; the Emperor himself is paid. I am not referring to the taxes  and tribute which flow in annually from subjects; the chief item in the  Emperor's pay is panegyrics, world-wide fame, and grateful devotion; the  statues, temples, and consecrated ground which their subjects bestow upon  them, what are these but pay for the care and forethought which they apply  to public policy and improvements? To compare small things with great, if  you will begin at the top of the heap and work down through the grains of  which it is composed, you will find that we inferior ones differ from the  superior in point of size, but all are wage-earners together.    If the law I laid down had been that no one should do anything, I might  fairly have been accused of transgressing it; but as my book contains  nothing of the sort, and as goodness consists in doing good, what better  use can you make of yourself than if you join forces with your friends in  the cause of progress, come out into the open, and let men see that you  are loyal and zealous and careful of your trust, not what Homer calls a  vain cumberer of the earth?    But before all, my critics are to remember that in me they will be  criticizing not a wise man (if indeed there is such a person on earth),  but one of the common people, one who has indeed practised rhetoric and  won some little reputation therein, but has never been trained up to the  perfect virtue of the really great. Well, I may surely be forgiven for  that; if any one ever did come up to the ideal of the wise man, it has  not been my fortune to meet him. And I confess further that I should be  disappointed if I found you criticizing my present life; you knew me long  ago when I was making a handsome income out of the public profession of  rhetoric; for on that Atlantic tour of yours which included Gaul, you  found me numbered among those teachers who could command high fees. Now,  my friend, you have my defence; I am exceedingly busy, but could not be  indifferent to securing _your_ vote of acquittal; as for others, let  them all denounce me with one voice if they will; on them I shall waste  no more words than, What cares Hippoclides?          A SLIP OF THE TONGUE IN SALUTATION  [Footnote: This piece, which even in the Greek fails to convince us that  Asclepius heard the prayer with which it concludes, is still flatter in  English, because we have no words of salutation which correspond at once  in etymological meaning and in conventional usage to the Greek. The  English reader who cares to understand a piece so little worth his  attention, will obligingly bear in mind that the Greek word represented  here by Joy and Rejoice roughly answered in Lucian's time to our Good-  morning and How do you do, as well as to the epistolary My dear----;  while that represented by Hail or Health did the work of Good-night,  Good-bye, Farewell, and (in letters) Yours truly.]      If a poor mortal has some difficulty in guarding against that spirit of  mischief which dwells aloft, he has still more in clearing himself of the  absurd consequences when that spirit trips him up. I am in both  predicaments at once; coming to make you my morning salutation, which  should have taken the orthodox form of Rejoice, I bade you, in a very  choice fit of absent-mindedness, Be healthy--a good enough wish in its  way, but a little untimely and unconnected with that early hour. I at  once went moist and red, not quite aware whether I was on my head or my  heels; some of the company took me for a lunatic, no doubt, some thought  I was in my second childhood, some that I had not quite got over my last  night's wine--though you yourself were the pink of good manners, not  showing your consciousness of the slip by any ghost of a smile. It  occurred to me to write to myself a little something in the way of  comfort, and so modify the distress my blunder gave me--prove to myself  that it was not absolutely unpardonable for an old man to transgress  etiquette so flagrantly before so many witnesses. As to apology, there  could be no occasion for that, when one's slip had resulted in so well-  omened a wish.    I began to write expecting my task to be very difficult, but found plenty  of material as I went on. I will defer it, however, till I have cleared  the way with a few necessary remarks on the three forms--Rejoice or Joy,  Prosper or Prosperity, Hail or Health. Joy is a very ancient greeting; but  it was not confined to the morning, or the first meeting. They did  use it when they first saw one another:      Joy to thee, Lord of this Tirynthian land!    But again at the moment when the wine succeeded to the meal:      Achilles, Joy! We lack not fair repast--    so says Odysseus discharging his embassy. And even at parting:      Joy be with you! And henceforth know me God,    No longer mortal man.    In fact the apostrophe was not limited to any particular season, as now  to the morning alone; indeed they used it on gloomy, nay, on the most  lamentable occasions; in Euripides, Polynices ends his life with the  words,      Joy with you! for the darkness closes on me.    Nor was it necessarily significative of friendliness; it could express  hatred and the determination to see no more of another.

On her arrival in this place, she went immediately to the habitation  of an elderly matron; to whom, as this matron had the good fortune to  resemble herself in the comeliness of her person, as well as in her  age, she had generally been more favourable than to any of the rest.  To this woman she imparted what had happened, and the design upon  which she was come thither that morning. These two began presently to  scrutinize the characters of the several young girls who lived in any  of those houses, and at last fixed their strongest suspicion on one  Jenny Jones, who, they both agreed, was the likeliest person to have  committed this fact.    This Jenny Jones was no very comely girl, either in her face or  person; but nature had somewhat compensated the want of beauty with  what is generally more esteemed by those ladies whose judgment is  arrived at years of perfect maturity, for she had given her a very  uncommon share of understanding. This gift Jenny had a good deal  improved by erudition. She had lived several years a servant with a  schoolmaster, who, discovering a great quickness of parts in the girl,  and an extraordinary desire of learning--for every leisure hour she  was always found reading in the books of the scholars--had the  good-nature, or folly--just as the reader pleases to call it--to  instruct her so far, that she obtained a competent skill in the Latin  language, and was, perhaps, as good a scholar as most of the young men  of quality of the age. This advantage, however, like most others of an  extraordinary kind, was attended with some small inconveniences: for  as it is not to be wondered at, that a young woman so well  accomplished should have little relish for the society of those whom  fortune had made her equals, but whom education had rendered so much  her inferiors; so is it matter of no greater astonishment, that this  superiority in Jenny, together with that behaviour which is its  certain consequence, should produce among the rest some little envy  and ill-will towards her; and these had, perhaps, secretly burnt in  the bosoms of her neighbours ever since her return from her service.    Their envy did not, however, display itself openly, till poor Jenny,  to the surprize of everybody, and to the vexation of all the young  women in these parts, had publickly shone forth on a Sunday in a new  silk gown, with a laced cap, and other proper appendages to these.    The flame, which had before lain in embryo, now burst forth. Jenny  had, by her learning, increased her own pride, which none of her  neighbours were kind enough to feed with the honour she seemed to  demand; and now, instead of respect and adoration, she gained nothing  but hatred and abuse by her finery. The whole parish declared she  could not come honestly by such things; and parents, instead of  wishing their daughters the same, felicitated themselves that their  children had them not.    Hence, perhaps, it was, that the good woman first mentioned the name  of this poor girl to Mrs Wilkins; but there was another circumstance  that confirmed the latter in her suspicion; for Jenny had lately been  often at Mr Allworthy's house. She had officiated as nurse to Miss  Bridget, in a violent fit of illness, and had sat up many nights with  that lady; besides which, she had been seen there the very day before  Mr Allworthy's return, by Mrs Wilkins herself, though that sagacious  person had not at first conceived any suspicion of her on that  account: for, as she herself said, \"She had always esteemed Jenny as a  very sober girl (though indeed she knew very little of her), and had  rather suspected some of those wanton trollops, who gave themselves  airs, because, forsooth, they thought themselves handsome.\"    Jenny was now summoned to appear in person before Mrs Deborah, which  she immediately did. When Mrs Deborah, putting on the gravity of a  judge, with somewhat more than his austerity, began an oration with  the words, \"You audacious strumpet!\" in which she proceeded rather to  pass sentence on the prisoner than to accuse her.    Though Mrs Deborah was fully satisfied of the guilt of Jenny, from the  reasons above shewn, it is possible Mr Allworthy might have required  some stronger evidence to have convicted her; but she saved her  accusers any such trouble, by freely confessing the whole fact with  which she was charged.    This confession, though delivered rather in terms of contrition, as it  appeared, did not at all mollify Mrs Deborah, who now pronounced a  second judgment against her, in more opprobrious language than before;  nor had it any better success with the bystanders, who were now grown  very numerous. Many of them cried out, \"They thought what madam's silk  gown would end in;\" others spoke sarcastically of her learning. Not a  single female was present but found some means of expressing her  abhorrence of poor Jenny, who bore all very patiently, except the  malice of one woman, who reflected upon her person, and tossing up her  nose, said, \"The man must have a good stomach who would give silk  gowns for such sort of trumpery!\" Jenny replied to this with a  bitterness which might have surprized a judicious person, who had  observed the tranquillity with which she bore all the affronts to her  chastity; but her patience was perhaps tired out, for this is a virtue  which is very apt to be fatigued by exercise.    Mrs Deborah having succeeded beyond her hopes in her inquiry, returned  with much triumph, and, at the appointed hour, made a faithful report  to Mr Allworthy, who was much surprized at the relation; for he had  heard of the extraordinary parts and improvements of this girl, whom  he intended to have given in marriage, together with a small living,  to a neighbouring curate. His concern, therefore, on this occasion,  was at least equal to the satisfaction which appeared in Mrs Deborah,  and to many readers may seem much more reasonable.    Miss Bridget blessed herself, and said, \"For her part, she should  never hereafter entertain a good opinion of any woman.\" For Jenny  before this had the happiness of being much in her good graces also.    The prudent housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy  culprit before Mr Allworthy, in order, not as it was hoped by some,  and expected by all, to be sent to the house of correction, but to  receive wholesome admonition and reproof; which those who relish that  kind of instructive writing may peruse in the next chapter.        Chapter vii.    Containing such grave matter, that the reader cannot laugh once  through the whole chapter, unless peradventure he should laugh at the  author.      When Jenny appeared, Mr Allworthy took her into his study, and spoke  to her as follows: \"You know, child, it is in my power as a  magistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; and  you will, perhaps, be the more apt to fear I should execute that  power, because you have in a manner laid your sins at my door.    \"But, perhaps, this is one reason which hath determined me to act in a  milder manner with you: for, as no private resentment should ever  influence a magistrate, I will be so far from considering your having  deposited the infant in my house as an aggravation of your offence,  that I will suppose, in your favour, this to have proceeded from a  natural affection to your child, since you might have some hopes to  see it thus better provided for than was in the power of yourself, or  its wicked father, to provide for it. I should indeed have been highly  offended with you had you exposed the little wretch in the manner of  some inhuman mothers, who seem no less to have abandoned their  humanity, than to have parted with their chastity. It is the other  part of your offence, therefore, upon which I intend to admonish you,  I mean the violation of your chastity;--a crime, however lightly it  may be treated by debauched persons, very heinous in itself, and very  dreadful in its consequences.    \"The heinous nature of this offence must be sufficiently apparent to  every Christian, inasmuch as it is committed in defiance of the laws  of our religion, and of the express commands of Him who founded that  religion.    \"And here its consequences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what  can be more so, than to incur the divine displeasure, by the breach of  the divine commands; and that in an instance against which the highest  vengeance is specifically denounced?    \"But these things, though too little, I am afraid, regarded, are so  plain, that mankind, however they may want to be reminded, can never  need information on this head. A hint, therefore, to awaken your sense  of this matter, shall suffice; for I would inspire you with  repentance, and not drive you to desperation.    \"There are other consequences, not indeed so dreadful or replete with  horror as this; and yet such, as, if attentively considered, must, one  would think, deter all of your sex at least from the commission of  this crime.    \"For by it you are rendered infamous, and driven, like lepers of old,  out of society; at least, from the society of all but wicked and  reprobate persons; for no others will associate with you.    \"If you have fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying  them; if you have none, you are disabled from acquiring any, nay  almost of procuring your sustenance; for no persons of character will  receive you into their houses. Thus you are often driven by necessity  itself into a state of shame and misery, which unavoidably ends in the  destruction of both body and soul.    \"Can any pleasure compensate these evils? Can any temptation have  sophistry and delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a  bargain? Or"]]]
