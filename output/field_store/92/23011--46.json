Chief among these free-thinkers, and, sooth to say, free-livers--though  in this respect they were less distinguished from the orthodox--was  Brunetto Latini, for some time Secretary to the Republic, and the  foremost Italian man of letters of his day. Meagre though his greatest  work, the _Tesoro_, or _Treasure_, must seem to any one who now glances  over its pages, to his contemporaries it answered the promise of its  title and stood for a magazine of almost complete information in the  domains of natural history, ethics, and politics. It was written in  French, as being a more agreeable language than Italian; and was  composed, there is reason to believe, while Latini lived in Paris as an  exiled Guelf after Montaperti. His _Tesoretto_, or _Little Treasure_, a  poem in jingling eight-syllabled Italian verse, has been thought by some  to have supplied hints to Dante for the _Comedy_.[35] By neither of  these works is he evinced a man of strong intellect, or even of good  taste. Yet there is the testimony of Villani that he did much to refine  the language of his contemporaries, and to apply fixed principles to the  conduct of State affairs.[36] Dante meets him in Inferno, and hails him  as his intellectual father--as the master who taught him from day to day  how fame is to be won.[37] But it is too much to infer from these words  that Latini served as his teacher, in the common sense of the word. It  is true they imply an intimacy between the veteran scholar and his  young townsman; but the closeness of their intercourse is perhaps best  accounted for by supposing that Latini had been acquainted with Dante's  father, and by the great promise of Dante's boyhood was led to take a  warm interest in his intellectual development. Their intimacy, to judge  from the tone of their conversation down in Inferno, had lasted till  Latini's death. But no tender reminiscence of the days they spent  together avails to save him from condemnation at the hands of his severe  disciple. By the manners of Brunetto, and the Epicurean heresies of  others of his friends, Dante, we may be sure, was never infected or  defiled.    Dante describes himself as having begun the serious study of philosophy  and theology only at the mature age of twenty-seven. But ere that time  he had studied to good effect, and not books alone, but the world around  him too, and the world within. The poet was formed before the theologian  and philosopher. From his earliest years he was used to write in verse;  and he seems to have esteemed as one of his best endowments the easy  command of his mother tongue acquired by him while still in boyhood.    Of the poems written in his youth he made a selection, and with a  commentary gave them to the world as his first work.[38] All the sonnets  and canzoni contained in it bear more or less directly on his love for  Beatrice Portinari. This lady, whose name is so indissolubly associated  with that of Dante, was the daughter of a rich citizen of good family.  When Dante saw her first he was a child of nine, and she a few months  younger. It would seem fabulous, he says, if he related what things he  did, and of what a passion he was the victim during his boyhood. He  seized opportunities of beholding her, but for long never passed beyond  a silent worship; and he was eighteen before she spoke to him, and then  only in the way of a passing salutation. On this he had a vision, and  that inspired him with a sonnet, certainly not the first he had written,  but the first he put into circulation. The mode of publication he  adopted was the common one of sending copies of it to such other poets  as were within reach. The sonnet in itself contains a challenge to  interpret his dream. Several poets attempted the riddle--among them the  philosopher and poet Guido Cavalcanti. They all failed in the solution;  but with some of them he was thus brought into terms of intimacy, and  with Cavalcanti of the closest friendship. Some new grace of style in  Dante's verse, some art in the presentation of his mystical meaning that  escapes the modern reader, may have revealed to the middle-aged man of  letters that a new genius had arisen. It was by Guido's advice that the  poems of which this sonnet stands the first were some years later  collected and published with the explanatory narrative. To him, in a  sense, the whole work is addressed; and it agreed with his taste, as  well as Dante's own, that it should contain nothing but what was written  in the vulgar tongue. Others besides Guido must have recognised in the  little book, as it passed from hand to hand, the masterpiece of Italian  prose, as well as of Italian verse. In the simple title of _Vita Nuova_,  or _The New Life_,[39] we can fancy that a claim is laid to originality  of both subject and treatment. Through the body of the work, though not  so clearly as in the _Comedy_, there rings the note of assurance of  safety from present neglect and future oblivion.    It may be owing to the free use of personification and symbol in the  _Vita Nuova_ that some critics, while not denying the existence of a  real Beatrice, have held that she is introduced only to help out an  allegory, and that, under the veil of love for her, the poet would  express his youthful passion for truth. Others, going to the opposite  extreme, are found wondering why he never sought, or, seeking, failed to  win, the hand of Beatrice. To those who would refine the Beatrice of the  early work into a being as purely allegorical as she of the _Comedy_, it  may be conceded that the _Vita Nuova_ is not so much the history of a  first love as of the new emotional and intellectual life to which a  first love, as Dante experienced it, opens the door. Out of the  incidents of their intercourse he chooses only such as serve for motives  to the joys and sorrows of the passionate aspiring soul. On the other  hand, they who seek reasons why Dante did not marry Beatrice have this  to justify their curiosity, that she did marry another man. But her  husband was one of the rich and powerful Bardi; and her father was so  wealthy that after providing for his children he could endow a hospital  in Florence. The marriage was doubtless arranged as a matter of family  convenience, due regard being had to her dower and her husband's  fortune; and we may assume that when Dante, too, was married later on,  his wife was found for him by the good offices of his friends.[40] Our  manners as regards these things are not those of the Italy of the  thirteenth century. It may safely be said that Dante never dreamed of  Beatrice for his wife; that the expectation of wedding her would have  sealed his lips from uttering to the world any word of his love; and  that she would have lost something in his esteem if, out of love for  him, she had refused the man her father chose for her.    We must not seek in the _Vita Nuova_ what it does not profess to give.  There was a real Beatrice Portinari, to a careless glance perhaps not  differing much from other Florentine ladies of her age and condition;  but her we do not find in Dante's pages. These are devoted to a record  of the dreams and visions, the new thoughts and feelings of which she  was the occasion or the object. He worshipped at a distance, and in a  single glance found reward enough for months of adoration; he read all  heaven into a smile. So high strung is the narrative, that did we come  on any hint of loving dalliance it would jar with all the rest She is  always at a distance from him, less a woman than an angel.    In all this there is certainly as much of reticence as of exaggeration.  When he comes to speak of her death he uses a phrase on which it would  seem as if too little value had been set. He cannot dwell on the  circumstances of her departure, he says, without being his own  panegyrist. Taken along with some other expressions in the _Vita Nuova_,  and the tone of her words to him when they meet in the Earthly Paradise,  we may gather from this that not only was she aware of his long  devotion, but that, ere she died, he had been given to understand how  highly she rated it. And on the occasion of her death, one described as  being her nearest relative by blood and, after Cavalcanti, Dante's chief  friend--her brother, no doubt--came to him and begged him to write  something concerning her. It would be strange indeed if they had never  looked frankly into one another's faces; and yet, for anything that is  directly told in the _Vita Nuova_, they never did.    The chief value of the _Vita Nuova_ is therefore psychological. It is a  mine of materials illustrative of the author's mental and emotional  development, but as regards historical details it is wanting in fulness  and precision. Yet, even in such a sketch of Dante's life as this tries  to be, it is necessary to dwell on the turning-points of the narrative  contained in the _Vita Nuova_; the reader always remembering that on one  side Dante says more than the fact that so he may glorify his love, "]]]
