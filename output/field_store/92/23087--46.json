Because of their insular position and somewhat primitive culture,  the inhabitants are primarily an agricultural and fishing people. The  principal crops are rice, sugar cane, corn, and copra. Judged by  Occidental standards, the mode of farming is backward and shows  little tendency to progress. The Filipinos who have been exposed  to industrial life, however, have been able to adapt themselves to  employment in the limited trade crafts and manufacturing on the island.    According to his own standards, the Filipino lives well enough. His  chief foods are rice or corn, fish, camotes (sweet potatoes), and  occasionally chicken or other meat. The men's clothing is simple;  the average man has several changes of cheap cotton shirts and pants  made of imported cotton cloth or, in the more remote districts,  from homespun material.    Most of the dwelling houses are made of bamboo and sheathed with  palm leaves on roof and sides. The material is gathered locally and  tied with rattan. The houses rarely consist of more than two rooms,  and many are raised on pilings, with space for the family pig and  chickens underneath. In one of the rooms, or outdoors, is an open  fireplace with a mud and stone hearth for cooking. There is little  furniture, and in three out of four families the personal possessions  would not be worth more than ten dollars.    Less than 5 percent of the people have a rising standard of  living. This higher standard is exemplified by a better type of  habitation, which ranges from a three-room house to a dwelling similar  to that of the American middle class. The diet of more prosperous  Filipinos is basically the same as that of the poorer class, but it  offers a greater variety. Clothing follows the Occidental fashion. The  wealthiest people and those with foreign education or contacts, who  make up less than 1 percent of the population, dress and live in the  same manner as Occidentals.    The Japanese, during their occupation, governed through the old  administrative organization of the province. They and their puppet  officials also set up larger governing bodies that exercised superior  jurisdiction. On 6 February 1944 the puppet president of the Philippine  Republic, Jos√© Laurel, appointed a commissioner who held supervisory  power over the local governments in the Visayan Provinces.    The governor of the province of Leyte, who previously had been  an elected official, was appointed by the president. He was the  chief operative and administrative head of the province and on all  provincial administrative matters his decision was final. The treasurer  of the province, who reported directly to the governor, was its chief  financial officer and tax assessor. He collected all taxes and license  fees, national and local, and prepared financial statements for the  governor but he had no say in administrative matters. The law officer  of the province was legal adviser to the governor and to the municipal  authorities. He could advise only on administrative matters.    The Japanese Military Administration maintained liaison between  the Japanese Army and the civil government. The military police  collected military intelligence and information and disseminated  propaganda. The Japanese allowed only one political party on the  Islands--the Kalibapi--to which all government officials were  required to belong. This party was one of the principal propaganda  agencies, being the prime mover of the pacification programs in the  province, and exercised general supervision over the local neighborhood  associations. The latter helped in maintaining law and order, assisted  the constabulary, and aided in the distribution of scarce commodities.    It should be emphasized that during most of the occupation there were  few Japanese on Leyte. Southern Leyte in general maintained the same  Filipino institutions and officials as in the prewar years. The heel  of the Japanese conqueror pressed but lightly on most of the people  of Leyte. Beginning in early 1944, however, the Japanese Army forces  on the island were reinforced. From that time forward the Filipinos  had their crops appropriated and in other ways were subjected to the  will of the Japanese. Misery, hunger, and poverty became commonplace  and a resistance movement grew.          The Resistance Movement on Leyte    The Organizing of Guerrilla Bands    A period of uncertainty and confusion followed the surrender of the  American and Filipino forces in the Philippines in the spring of  1942. Civilians and members of the armed forces who did not surrender  to the Japanese Army fled into the hills. Some went because they wanted  to continue the fight, others because they felt that the chaotic  conditions on the Islands would afford unequaled opportunities for  looting and pillaging.    Once in the hills, the men formed themselves into guerrilla bands. [44]  At first all of the bands, because of their lack of money and supplies,  freely raided farms and storehouses for food and equipment whenever  they had the opportunity. Moreover, there were real bandit groups  who frequently and wantonly raped the countryside. For a time all  of the groups were discredited by the people. Gradually, however,  strong men emerged who formed the guerrilla bands into semi-military  organizations. The leader of each band, who was generally an ex-member  of the armed forces, gave himself a \"bamboo commission,\" usually  considerably higher than the one he had hitherto possessed.    The following oath of allegiance taken by the members of one of the  bands is probably typical:          I do solemnly swear that I shall obey orders from my superior      officer; that I shall fight the enemy of the Government of      the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the United States of      America whosoever and wherever he maybe [sic] in the territory      of the Philippines; that I shall never allow myself nor any      arm or ammunition to be caught by the enemy; that I shall never      turn traitor to my country nor the United States of America; and      muchless [sic] reveal to the enemy any secret of the Army to which      I honorably belong; that I shall never abandon a wounded brother      in arms; that I join the United Forces in the Philippines without      personal or party interest, but with the determination to sacrifice      myself and all that is mine for FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY; that I shall      protect the lives and property of all loyal Filipinos everywhere.        I make this LOYALTY OATH without mental reservation or purpose      of evasion.        SO HELP ME GOD. [45]      For some time the various guerrilla bands on Leyte operated separately,  and there was little or no co-operation between them. They were united,  however, in their hatred of the Japanese. Jealousy and strife between  groups were rampant, but circumstances gradually compelled the smaller  bands to submit to absorption, either by force or persuasion, into  the larger and more powerful groups. The fact that there were few  Japanese on the island enabled the guerrillas and loyal provincial  officials to organize the governments of most of the barrios.    All of the guerrillas declared that their primary purpose was to aid  the civilians, maintain peace and order, and keep the Japanese from  abusing the people. They also assumed control over various phases  of public activities--the allotment of food supplies, the issue of  emergency currency, and the punishment of criminals. The guerrillas  in northern Leyte depended upon voluntary contributions to support  them, while those in southern Leyte levied a loyalty tax. Hard money  having been driven out of circulation, the guerrilla units tried to  issue paper, which was acceptable only in those regions where the  particular unit was active. There was no widespread circulation or  acceptance of any of the guerrilla money.    The most important of the guerrilla leaders on Leyte were  Lt. Col. Ruperto K. Kangleon and Brig. Gen. Blas E. Miranda. Colonel  Kangleon had served for twenty-seven years in the Philippine Army  and was a graduate of the Philippine Academy and General Service  School. General Miranda, [46] a former member of the Philippine  Constabulary, was very hostile to the Japanese and to anyone who  surrendered to them. He killed many former prisoners, whom the Japanese  had released, on the pretext that they were enemy spies. Miranda was  especially bitter toward Kangleon, a former prisoner of the enemy.    Official recognition from General MacArthur's headquarters was  slow in reaching the guerrillas on Leyte, a fact that brought about  misunderstandings. General MacArthur had early established contact with  Col. Macario Peralta on Panay and Col. Wendell Fertig on Mindanao. In  the middle of February 1943 MacArthur sent Lt. Comdr. Charles Parsons,  USNR, to the Islands by submarine. Before his departure, General  Headquarters had established the policies to be followed. The prewar  military districts, as of December 1940, were to be revived. [47] Since  General MacArthur had received information that Colonel Fertig had  successfully created an effective guerrilla organization on Mindanao  and Colonel Peralta one on Panay, he recognized them as commanders of  the 10th and 6th Military Districts, respectively. Radio communication  from MacArthur's headquarters informed Peralta and Fertig of the  appointments on 21 February 1943. Commander Parsons also carried  formal letters, dated 13 February 1943, making these appointments.    Parsons safely reached the Philippines in early March and established  friendly relations with Colonel Fertig. While on Mindanao he made  several local trips, one to southern Leyte where he heard of Colonel  Kangleon who had escaped from the Butuan prison camp and returned to  his home. Parsons visited Kangleon with the promise that he would  be made commander of the 9th Military District (Leyte and Samar),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],[0,"Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#7)"],[1,"of the life process of the moth and quickens its circulation and  develops its strength for the affairs of life afterward.  If the  feet have a steady pull to drag forth the body, they will be  strong enough to bear its weight while the wings dry and develop.    All lepidopterists mention the wet condition of the moths when they  emerge.  Some explain that an acid is ejected to soften the pupa  case so that the moth can cut its way  out; others go a step  farther and state that the acid is from the mouth.  I am extremely  curious about this.  I want to know just what this acid is and  where it comes from.  I know of no part of the thorax provided with  a receptacle for the amount of liquid used to flood a case, dampen  a moth, and leave several drops in the shell.    As soon as a moth can find a suitable place to cling after it is  out, it hangs by the feet and dries the wings and down.  Long  before it is dry if you try to move a moth or cause disturbance,  it will eject several copious jets of a spray from the abdomen  that appears, smells and tastes precisely like the liquid found in  the abandoned case.  If protected from the lightest touch it will  do the same.  It appeals to me that this liquid is abdominal,  partly thrown off to assist the moth in emergence; something  very like that bath of birth which accompanies and facilitates  human entrance into the world.  It helps the struggling moth in  separating from the case, wets the down so that it will pass the  small opening, reduces the large abdomen so that it will escape the  exit, and softens the case and silk where the moth is working.  With either male or female the increase in size is so rapid that  neither could be returned to their cases five minutes after they  have left them.    It is generally supposed that the spray thrown by a developing  moth is for the purpose of attracting others of its kind.  I have  my doubts.  With moths that have been sheltered and not even  touched by a breath of wind, this spray is thrown very frequently  before the moth is entirely dry, long before it is able to fly  and before the ovipositor is thrust out.  According to my sense of  smell there is very little odour to the spray and what there is  would be dissipated hours before night and time for the moths to  fly  and seek mates.  I do not think that the spray thrown so soon  after escape from cocoon or case is to attract the sexes, any farther  than that much of it in one place on something that it would saturate  might leave a general 'mothy' odour.  Some lepidopterists think this  spray a means of defence; if this is true I fail to see why it should  be thrown when there is nothing disturbing the moth.    Many of the spinning moths use leaves for their outer foundation.  Some appear as if snugly rolled in a leaf and hanging from a twig,  but examination will prove that the stem is silk covered to hold  the case when the leaf loosens.  This is the rule with all  Promethea cocoons I ever have seen.  Polyphemus selects a cluster  of leaves very frequently thorn, and weaves its cocoon against  three, drawing them together and spinning a support the length of  the stems, so that when the leaf is ready to fall the cocoon is  safely anchored.  When the winter winds have beaten the edges from  the leaves, the cocoon appears as if it were brown, having three  ribs with veins running from them, and of triangular shape.  Angulifera spins against the leaves but provides no support and so  drops to the ground.  Luna spins a comparatively thin white case,  among the leaves under the shelter of logs and stumps.  Io spins so  slightly in confinement that the pupa case and cast skin show  through.  I never have found a pupa out of doors, but this is a  ground caterpillar.    Sometimes the caterpillar has been stung and bad an egg placed in  its skin by a parasite, before pupation.  In such case the pupa  is destroyed by the developing fly.  Throughout one winter I was  puzzled by the light weight of what appeared to be a good Polyphemus  cocoon, and at time for emergence amazed by the tearing and  scratching inside the cocoon, until what I think was an Ophion  fly appeared.  It was honey yellow, had antennae long as its  extremely long body, the abdomen of which was curved and the  segments set together so as to appear notched.  The wings were  transparent and the insect it seems is especially designed to  attack Polyphemus caterpillars and help check a progress that  otherwise might become devastating.    Among the moths that do not feed, the year of their evolution is  divided into about seven days for the life of the moth, from  fifteen to thirty for the eggs, from five to six weeks for the  caterpillar and the remainder of the time in the pupa stage.  The  rule differs with feeding moths only in that after mating and egg  placing they take food and live several months, often until quite  heavy frosts have fallen.    One can admire to fullest extent the complicated organism, wondrous  colouring, and miraculous life processes in the evolution of a  moth, but that is all.  Their faces express nothing; their  attitudes tell no story.  There is the marvellous instinct through  which the males locate the opposite sex of their species; but one  cannot see instinct in the face of any creature; it must develop  in acts.  There is no part of their lives that makes such pictures  of mother-love as birds and animals afford.  The male finds a mate  and disappears.  The female places her eggs and goes out before her  caterpillars break their shells.  The caterpillar transforms to the  moth without its consent, the matter in one upbuilding the other.  The entire process is utterly devoid of sentiment, attachment or  volition on the part of the creatures involved.  They work out a  law as inevitable as that which swings suns, moons, and planets  in their courses.  They  are the most fragile and beautiful result  of natural law with which I am acquainted.        CHAPTER III The Robin Moth: Cecropia      When only a little child, wandering alone among the fruits and flowers  of our country garden, on a dead peach limb beside the fence I found  it--my  first Cecropia.  I was the friend of every bird, flower, and  butterfly.  I carried crumbs to the warblers in the sweetbrier; was  lifted for surreptitious peeps at the hummingbird nesting in the  honeysuckle; sat within a few feet of the robin in the catalpa;  bugged the currant bushes for the phoebe that had built for years  under the roof of the corn bin; and fed young blackbirds in the  hemlock with worms gathered from the cabbages.  I knew how to  insinuate myself into the private life of each bird that homed  on our farm, and they were many, for we valiantly battled for their  protection with every kind of intruder.  There were wrens in the  knot holes, chippies in the fences, thrushes in the brush heaps,  bluebirds in the hollow apple trees, cardinals in the bushes,  tanagers in the saplings, fly-catchers in the trees, larks in the  wheat, bobolinks in the clover, killdeers beside the creeks,  swallows in the chimneys, and martins under the barn eaves.  My  love encompassed all feathered and furred creatures.    Every day visits were paid flowers I cared for most.  I had been  taught not to break the garden blooms, and if a very few of the  wild ones were taken, I gathered them carefully, and explained to  the plants that I wanted them for my mother because she was so ill  she could not come to them any more, and only a few touching her  lips or lying on her pillow helped her to rest, and made vivid the  fields and woods when the pain was severe.    My love for the butterflies took on the form of adoration.  There  was not a delicate, gaudy, winged creature of day that did not  make so strong an appeal to my heart as to be almost painful.  It  seemed to me that the most exquisite thoughts of God for our  pleasure were materialized in their beauty.  My soul always craved  colour, and more brilliancy could be found on one butterfly wing  than on many flower faces.  I liked to slip along the bloom-bordered  walks of that garden and stand spell-bound, watching a black velvet  butterfly, which trailed wings painted in white, red, and green, as  it clambered over a clump of sweet-williams, and indeed, the flowers  appeared plain compared with it!  Butterflies have changed their  habits since then.  They fly so high!  They are all among the  treetops now.  They used to flit around the cinnamon pinks, larkspur,  ragged-robins and tiger lilies, within easy reach of little fingers,  every day.  I called them 'flying flowers,' and it was a pretty  conceit, for they really were more delicate in texture and brighter  in colouring than the garden blooms.    Having been taught that God created the heavens, earth and all  things therein, I understood it to mean a literal creation of each  separate thing and creature, as when my father cut down a tree and  hewed it into a beam.  I would spend hours sitting so immovably  among the flowers of our garden that the butterflies would mistake  me for a plant and alight on my head and hands, while I strove to  conceive the greatness of a Being who could devise and colour all  those different butterfly wings.  I would try to decide whether  He created the birds, flowers, or butterflies first; ultimately  coming to the conclusion that He put His most exquisite material  into the butterflies, and then did the best He could with what  remained, on the birds and flowers.    In my home there was a cellar window on the south, covered with  wire screening, that was my individual property.  Father placed a  box beneath it so that I could reach the sill easily, and there  were very few butterflies or insects common to eastern North  America a specimen of which had not spent some days on that screen,  feasted on leaves and flowers, drunk from saucers of sweetened  water, been admired and studied in minutest detail, "]]]
