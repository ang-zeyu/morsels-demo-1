Having established these rules, we resolved to enter into some measures  for our food, and for conversing with the inhabitants or natives of the  island for our supply. As for food, they were at first very useful to  us, but we soon grew weary of them, being an ignorant, ravenous, brutish  sort of people, even worse than the natives of any other country that we  had seen; and we soon found that the principal part of our subsistence  was to be had by our guns, shooting of deer and other creatures, and  fowls of all other sorts, of which there is abundance.    We found the natives did not disturb or concern themselves much about  us; nor did they inquire, or perhaps know, whether we stayed among them  or not, much less that our ship was gone quite away, and had cast us  off, as was our case; for the next morning, after we had sent back the  long-boat, the ship stood away to the south-east, and in four hours'  time was out of our sight.    The next day two of us went out into the country one way, and two  another, to see what kind of a land we were in; and we soon found the  country was very pleasant and fruitful, and a convenient place enough  to live in; but, as before, inhabited by a parcel of creatures scarce  human, or capable of being made social on any account whatsoever.    We found the place full of cattle and provisions; but whether we might  venture to take them where we could find them or not, we did not know;  and though we were under a necessity to get provisions, yet we were loth  to bring down a whole nation of devils upon us at once, and therefore  some of our company agreed to try to speak with some of the country,  if we could, that we might see what course was to be taken with them.  Eleven of our men went on this errand, well armed and furnished for  defence. They brought word that they had seen some of the natives, who  appeared very civil to them, but very shy and afraid, seeing their guns,  for it was easy to perceive that the natives knew what their guns were,  and what use they were of.    They made signs to the natives for some food, and they went and fetched  several herbs and roots, and some milk; but it was evident they did not  design to give it away, but to sell it, making signs to know what our  men would give them.    Our men were perplexed at this, for they had nothing to barter; however,  one of the men pulled out a knife and showed them, and they were so fond  of it that they were ready to go together by the ears for the knife. The  seaman seeing that, was willing to make a good market of his knife, and  keeping them chaffering about it a good while, some offered him roots,  and others milk; at last one offered him a goat for it, which he took.  Then another of our men showed them another knife, but they had nothing  good enough for that, whereupon one of them made signs that he would  go and fetch something; so our men stayed three hours for their return,  when they came back and brought him a small-sized, thick, short cow,  very fat and good meat, and gave him for his knife.    This was a good market, but our misfortune was we had no merchandise;  for our knives were as needful to us as to them, and but that we were in  distress for food, and must of necessity have some, these men would not  have parted with their knives.    However, in a little time more we found that the woods were full of  living creatures, which we might kill for our food, and that without  giving offence to them; so that our men went daily out a-hunting, and  never failed in killing something or other; for, as to the natives, we  had no goods to barter; and for money, all the stock among us would not  have subsisted us long. However, we called a general council to see what  money we had, and to bring it all together, that it might go as far as  possible; and when it came to my turn, I pulled out a moidore and the  two dollars I spoke of before.    This moidore I ventured to show, that they might not despise me too much  for adding too little to the store, and that they might not pretend to  search me; and they were very civil to me, upon the presumption that I  had been so faithful to them as not to conceal anything from them.    But our money did us little service, for the people neither knew  the value or the use of it, nor could they justly rate the gold in  proportion with the silver; so that all our money, which was not much  when it was all put together, would go but a little way with us, that is  to say, to buy us provisions.    Our next consideration was to get away from this cursed place, and  whither to go. When my opinion came to be asked, I told them I would  leave that all to them, and I told them I had rather they would let me  go into the woods to get them some provisions, than consult with me, for  I would agree to whatever they did; but they would not agree to that,  for they would not consent that any of us should go into the woods  alone; for though we had yet seen no lions or tigers in the woods, we  were assured there were many in the island, besides other creatures  as dangerous, and perhaps worse, as we afterwards found by our own  experience.    We had many adventures in the woods, for our provisions, and often met  with wild and terrible beasts, which we could not call by their names;  but as they were, like us, seeking their prey, but were themselves good  for nothing, so we disturbed them as little as possible.    Our consultations concerning our escape from this place, which, as I  have said, we were now upon, ended in this only, that as we had two  carpenters among us, and that they had tools almost of all sorts with  them, we should try to build us a boat to go off to sea with, and that  then, perhaps, we might find our way back to Goa, or land on some more  proper place to make our escape. The counsels of this assembly were  not of great moment, yet as they seem to be introductory of many more  remarkable adventures which happened under my conduct hereabouts many  years after, I think this miniature of my future enterprises may not be  unpleasant to relate.    To the building of a boat I made no objection, and away they went to  work immediately; but as they went on, great difficulties occurred,  such as the want of saws to cut our plank; nails, bolts, and spikes, to  fasten the timbers; hemp, pitch, and tar, to caulk and pay her seams,  and the like. At length, one of the company proposed that, instead of  building a bark or sloop, or shallop, or whatever they would call  it, which they found was so difficult, they would rather make a large  periagua, or canoe, which might be done with great ease.    It was presently objected, that we could never make a canoe large enough  to pass the great ocean, which we were to go over to get to the coast  of Malabar; that it not only would not bear the sea, but it would never  bear the burden, for we were not only twenty-seven men of us, but had  a great deal of luggage with us, and must, for our provision, take in a  great deal more.    I never proposed to speak in their general consultations before, but  finding they were at some loss about what kind of vessel they should  make, and how to make it, and what would be fit for our use, and what  not, I told them I found they were at a full stop in their counsels of  every kind; that it was true we could never pretend to go over to Goa on  the coast of Malabar in a canoe, which though we could all get into  it, and that it would bear the sea well enough, yet would not hold our  provisions, and especially we could not put fresh water enough into it  for the voyage; and to make such an adventure would be nothing but mere  running into certain destruction, and yet that nevertheless I was for  making a canoe.    They answered, that they understood all I had said before well enough,  but what I meant by telling them first how dangerous and impossible  it was to make our escape in a canoe, and yet then to advise making a  canoe, that they could not understand.    To this I answered, that I conceived our business was not to attempt our  escape in a canoe, but that, as there were other vessels at sea besides  our ship, and that there were few nations that lived on the sea-shore  that were so barbarous, but that they went to sea in some boats or  other, our business was to cruise along the coast of the island, which  was very long, and to seize upon the first we could get that was better  than our own, and so from that to another, till perhaps we might at last  get a good ship to carry us wherever we pleased to go.    \"Excellent advice,\" says one of them. \"Admirable advice,\" says another.  \"Yes, yes,\" says the third (which was the gunner), \"the English dog has  given excellent advice; but it is just the way to bring us all to  the gallows. The rogue has given us devilish advice, indeed, to go  a-thieving, till from a little vessel we came to a great ship, and so we  shall turn downright pirates, the end of which is to be hanged.\"    \"You may call us pirates,\" says another, \"if you will, and if we fall  into bad hands, we may be used like pirates; but I care not for that,  I'll be a pirate, or anything, nay, I'll be hanged for a pirate rather  than starve here, therefore I think the advice is very good.\" And so  they cried all, \"Let us have a canoe.\" The gunner, over-ruled by the  rest, submitted; but as we broke up the council, he came to me, takes  me by the hand, and, looking into the palm of my hand, and into my face  too, very gravely, \"My lad,\" says he, \"thou art born to do a world of  mischief; thou hast commenced pirate very young; but have a care of  the gallows, young man; have a care, I say, for thou wilt be an eminent  thief.\"    I laughed at him, and told him I did not know what I might come to  hereafter, but as our case was now, I should make no scruple to take the  first ship I came at to get our liberty; I only wished we could "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#7)"],[1,"to me at once I shall just go and tell mamma.\"    \"I will let you take it in your hand a few moments to look at it, if  you will be careful not to soil it, Enna,\" said Elsie, in the same  gentle tone; \"and if you wish, I will get some more silk and beads, and  make you one just like it; but I cannot give you this, because I would  not have time to make another for Miss Rose.\"    \"No, I shall just have that one; and I shall have it to keep,\" said  Enna, attempting to snatch it out of Elsie's hand.    But Elsie held it up out of her reach, and after trying several times  in vain to get it, Enna left the room, crying and screaming with  passion.    Chloe locked the door, saying, \"Great pity, darlin', we forgot to do  dat 'fore Miss Enna came. I'se 'fraid she gwine bring missus for make  you gib um up.\"    Elsie sat down to her work again, but she was very pale, and her little  hands trembled with agitation, and her soft eyes were full of tears.    Chloe's fears were but too well founded; for the next moment hasty  steps were heard in the passage, and the handle of the door was laid  hold of with no very gentle grasp; and then, as it refused to yield to  her touch, Mrs. Dinsmore's voice was heard in an angry tone giving the  command, \"Open this door instantly.\"    Chloe looked at her young mistress.    \"You will have to,\" said Elsie, tearfully, slipping her work into her  pocket again, and lifting up her heart in prayer for patience and  meekness, for she well knew she would have need of both.    Mrs. Dinsmore entered, leading the sobbing Enna by the hand; her face  was flushed with passion, and addressing Elsie in tones of violent  anger, she asked, \"What is the meaning of all this, you  good-for-nothing hussy? Why are you always tormenting this poor child?  Where is that paltry trifle that all this fuss is about? let me see it  this instant.\"    Elsie drew the purse from her pocket, saying in tearful, trembling  tones, \"It is a purse I was making for Miss Rose, ma'am; and I offered  to make another just like it for Enna; but I cannot give her this one,  because there would not be time to make another before Miss Rose goes  away.\"    \"You _can_ not give it to her, indeed! You _will_ not, you mean; but I  say you _shall;_ and I'll see if I'm not mistress in my own house. Give  it to the child this instant; I'll not have her crying her eyes out  that you may be humored in all your whims. There are plenty of  handsomer ones to be had in the city, and if you are too mean to make  her a present of it, I'll buy you another to-morrow.\"    \"But that would not be my work, and this is,\" replied Elsie, still  retaining the purse, loath to let it go.    \"Nonsense! what difference will that make to Miss Rose?\" said Mrs.  Dinsmore; and snatching it out of her hand, she gave it to Enna,  saying, \"There, my pet, you shall have it. Elsie is a naughty, mean,  stingy girl, but she shan't plague you while your mamma's about.\"    Enna cast a look of triumph at Elsie, and ran off with her prize,  followed by her mother, while poor Elsie hid her face in Chloe's lap  and cried bitterly.    It required all Chloe's religion to keep down her anger and indignation  at this unjust and cruel treatment of her darling, and for a few  moments she allowed her to sob and cry without a word, only soothing  her with mute caresses, not daring to trust her voice, lest her anger  should find vent in words. But at length, when her feelings had grown  somewhat calmer, she said soothingly, \"Nebber mind it, my poor darlin'  chile. Just go to de city and buy de prettiest purse you can find, for  Miss Rose.\"    But Elsie shook her head sadly. \"I wanted it to be my own work,\" she  sobbed, \"and now there is no time.\"    \"Oh! I'll tell you what, my pet,\" exclaimed Chloe suddenly, \"dere's de  purse you was aknittin' for your papa, an' dey wouldn't send it for  you; you can get dat done for de lady, and knit another for your papa,  'fore he comes home.\"    Elsie raised her head with a look of relief, but her face clouded  again, as she replied, \"But it is not quite done, and I haven't the  beads to finish it with, and Miss Rose goes day after to-morrow.\"    \"Nebber mind dat, darlin',\" said Chloe, jumping up; \"Pomp he been gwine  to de city dis berry afternoon, an' we'll tell him to buy de beads, an'  den you can get de purse finished 'fore to-morrow night, an' de lady  don't go till de next day, an' so it gwine all come right yet.\"    \"Oh! yes, that will do; dear old mammy, I'm so glad you thought of it,\"  said Elsie, joyfully. And rising, she went to her bureau, and unlocking  a drawer, took from it a bead purse of blue and gold, quite as handsome  as the one of which she had been so ruthlessly despoiled, and rolling  it up in a piece of paper, she handed it to Chloe, saying: \"There,  mammy, please give it to Pomp, and tell him to match the beads and the  silk exactly.\"    Chloe hastened in search of Pomp, but when she found him, he insisted  that he should not have time to attend to Miss Elsie's commission and  do his other errands; and Chloe, knowing that he, in common with all  the other servants, was very fond of the little girl, felt satisfied  that it was not merely an excuse, therefore did not urge her request.  She stood a moment in great perplexity, then suddenly exclaimed, \"I'll  go myself. Miss Elsie will spare me, an' I'll go right long wid you,  Pomp.\"    Chloe was entirely Elsie's servant, having no other business than to  wait upon her and take care of her clothing and her room; and the  little girl, of course, readily gave her permission to accompany Pomp  and do the errand.    But it was quite late ere Chloe returned, and the little girl spent the  evening alone in her own room. She was sadly disappointed that she  could not even have her hour with Miss Rose, who was detained in the  parlor with company whom she could not leave, and so the evening seemed  very long and wore away very slowly.    But at last Chloe came, and in answer to her eager inquiries displayed  her purchases with great satisfaction, saying, \"Yes, darlin', I'se got  de berry t'ings you wanted.\"    \"Oh! yes,\" said Elsie, examining them with delight; \"they are just  right; and now I can finish it in a couple of hours.\"    \"Time to get ready for bed now, ain't it, pet?\" asked Chloe; but before  the little girl had time to answer, a servant knocked at the door, and  handed in a note for her. It was from Miss Allison, and, hastily  tearing it open, she read:    \"DEAR ELSIE--I am very sorry that we cannot have our reading together  this evening; but be sure, darling, to come to me early in the morning;  it will be our last opportunity, for, dear child, I have another  disappointment for you. I had not expected to leave before day after  to-morrow, but I have learned this evening that the vessel sails a day  sooner than I had supposed, and therefore I shall be obliged to start  on my journey to-morrow.    \"Your friend,                                              ROSE.\"    Elsie dropped the note on the floor and burst into tears.    \"What de matter, darlin'?\" asked Chloe, anxiously.    \"Oh! Miss Rose, dear, _dear_ Miss Rose is going tomorrow,\" she sobbed.  Then hastily drying her eyes, she said: \"But I have no time for crying.  I must sit up and finish the purse to-night, because there will not be  time to-morrow.\"    It was long past her usual hour for retiring when at last her task, or  rather her labor of love, was completed. Yet she was up betimes, and at  the usual hour her gentle rap was heard at Miss Allison's door.    Rose clasped her in her arms and kissed her tenderly.    \"O Miss Rose! _dear, dear_ Miss Rose, what shall I do without you?\"  sobbed the little girl. \"I shall have nobody to love me now but mammy.\"    \"You have another and a better friend, dear Elsie, who has said, 'I  will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,'\" whispered Rose, with another  tender caress.    \"Yes,\" said Elsie, wiping away her tears; \"and He is your Friend, too;  and don't you think, Miss Rose, He will bring us together again some  day?\"    \"I hope so indeed, darling. We must keep very close to Him, dear Elsie;  we must often commune with Him in secret; often study His word, and try  always to do His will. Ah! dear child, if we can only have the  assurance that that dear Friend is with us--that we have His presence  and His love, we shall be supremely happy, though separated from all  earthly friends. I know, dear little one, that you have peculiar  trials, and that you often feel the want of sympathy and love; but you  may always find them in Jesus. And now we will have our reading and  prayer as usual.\"    She took the little girl in her lap, and opening the Bible, read aloud  the fourteenth chapter of John, a part of that touching farewell of our  Saviour to His sorrowing disciples; and then they knelt to pray. Elsie  was only a listener, for her little heart was too full to allow her to  be anything more.    \"My poor darling!\" Rose said, again taking her in her arms, \"we will  hope to meet again before very long. Who knows but your papa may come  home, and some day bring you to see me. It seems not unlikely, as he is  so fond of traveling.\"    Elsie looked up, smiling through her tears, \"Oh! how delightful that  would be,\" she said. \"But it seems as though my papa would never come,\"  she added, with a deep-drawn sigh.    \"Well, darling, we can hope,\" Rose answered cheerfully. \"And, dear  child, though we must be separated in body for a time, we can still  meet in spirit at the mercy-seat. Shall we not do so at this hour every  morning?\"    Elsie gave a joyful assent.    \"And I shall write to you, darling,\" Rose said; \"I will write on my  journey, if I can, so that you will get the letter in a week from the  time I leave; and then you must write to me; will you?\"    \"If you won't care for the mistakes, Miss Rose. But you know I am a  very little girl, and I wouldn't like to let Miss Day"]]]
