They darken counsel by words without knowledge. Therefore, to heal  the schisms in Christendom; to bring order out of the existing chaos;  to stay the stream of unbelief within the churches; to convert the  Jews; to evangelize the world; to bring to pass that universal reign  of truth, of peace, of liberty, of righteousness that all the prophets  have predicted--the world needs a new witness for God.    Footnotes    1. Such is the language, slightly paraphrased, which Mrs. Humphrey Ward  puts in the mouth of the orthodox Ronalds in her dialogue entitled _The  New Reformation_ (See Agnosticism and Christianity--Humbolt Library  Series, page 151); and it accurately states the claims of the orthodox  Christian.    2. \"Agnosticism and Christianity,\" p. 151. The passage is paraphrased.    3. I thus carefully qualify the statement for the reason that I believe  the Christian religion--that is, the Gospel, has a much earlier  existence than the birth of Christ. Messiah is spoken of in Scripture  as \"the lamb slain from the foundation of the world,\" from which  expression in connection with many other evidences--too numerous to  mention here (see the Author's work \"The Gospel,\" ch. xxxii.)--I get  the idea that the plan of man's redemption through the atonement of  Jesus Christ is at least as old as the foundation of the world. It was  revealed to Adam, and the Patriarchs, to Abraham, to Moses, and to some  of the prophets; and finally through the earthly ministry of the Son of  God himself; but it is an error to suppose that it came into existence  first through the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth on earth.    4.

It is as if he had said to  the inhabitants of this globe we call ours, 'I have made an earth for  man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the starry heavens visible, to  teach him science and the arts. He can now provide for his own comfort,  and learn from my munificence to all, to be kind to each other.' * *  * * * In Deism our reason and our belief become happily united. The  wonderful structure of the universe, and everything we behold in the  system of the creation, prove to us far better than books can do, the  existence of a God and at the same time proclaim his attributes. It is  by exercise of our reason that we are enabled to contemplate God in his  works and imitate him in his ways. When we see his care and goodness  extended over all his creatures, it teaches us our duty towards each  other while it calls forth our gratitude to him.\"--_Thomas Paine._    13. \"It is not in the name of this or that philosophy, but in the name  of constant experience that we banish miracle from history.

The whole world of profane history has been revolutionized: * * *  * The views of the ancient world formerly entertained have been in ten  thousand points either modified or revised--a new antiquity has been  raised up out of the old--while much that was unreal in the picture  of past times which men had formed to themselves has disappeared,  consigned to that \"Limbo large and broad\" into which \"all things  transitory and vain\" are finally received, a fresh revelation has in  many cases taken the place of the old view, which has dissolved before  the wand of the critic; and a firm and strong fabric has arisen out  of the shattered _debris_ of the fallen systems.--George Rawlinson's  \"Historical Evidences\" (London Edition) pp. 28, 29.    18. A footnote scarcely affords the space necessary in which to discuss  the value of miracles as evidence to the truth of a religion or the  divine authority of the miracle worker; but a few observations at this  particular point will be, in the estimation of the author, _apropos._  It is a mistake on the part of the Protestants or any one else to  concede that the power to work miracles is absolute evidence of the  truth of a religion, or of the divine calling of the miracle worker.  Too much importance has been given to miracles as evidence of divine  authority. Looking upon what are commonly called miracles, not as  events or effects contrary to the laws of nature, but interventions on  the part of God (through the operation of natural, though perhaps to  man unknown laws) for the benefit of his children, and recognizing God  as the Father of all mankind, it would be an extremely narrow conception  of the love and mercy of the Deity to suppose that he would confine  these interventions to any one class of his children. Surely it is  egotism run mad for a people to suppose that they have succeeded so  far in becoming the special favorites of heaven that all God's special  providences will be confined to them. No, no; he who maketh his sun  to rise on the evil as well as the good, and sendeth rain on the  just and unjust alike, is capable of better things than men ascribe  to him in this matter of miracles. But it does not follow that those  who enjoy these special manifestations have correct religious creeds  or possess the fullness of truth. Equally erroneous is it to suppose  that the powers of evil cannot work what are called miracles; that is,  put into operation forces as yet unknown to man which produce effects  uncommon to his experience. Can it be that our Christian writers have  forgotten that \"to win us to our harm, the instruments of darkness  tell us truths--win us with honest trifles, to betray us in deepest  consequences?\" Have they forgotten that the miracles of Moses were well  nigh matched by those of the magicians of Egypt? That Simon Magus,  notwithstanding he had no lot nor part in the things of God, yet had  wrought miracles. Have they forgotten that in the description given us  in Holy Writ (II. Thess. ii.) of the rise of Anti-Christ, that Satan  shall have power to work \"signs and lying wonders,\" and that God will  permit the strong delusions that those might be condemned who believe  not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness? Have they forgotten  that the word of prophecy hath said that even unclean spirits,  \"devils,\" shall have the power of \"working miracles,\" even calling down  fire from heaven, to deceive the inhabitants of the earth? (Rev. xvi)?  If miracles are to be taken as an absolute test of divine authority,  will not the unclean spirits, these miracle-working devils, prove the  divinity of their mission? Again, it said that \"John\" (the baptist),  than whom there is no greater prophet, \"did no miracle\" (John x. 41).  It appears, therefore, that not all that are sent of God work miracles;  and we see that devils have in the past and will in the future possess  that power; hence miracles are not as important a class of testimony as  they have usually been esteemed; and writers are utterly at fault who  regard them as an absolute test of true religion or divine authority.    19. I find it necessary to say another word on miracles. There is a  general misapprehension, I think, of what a miracle really is. The  commonly accepted definition of the term is, \"an event or effect  contrary to the established constitution and course of things, or a  deviation from the known laws of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#7)"],[1,"streets, in which presumably it existed till rescued from  the low depth of misery which the miscellaneous box is supposed to  imply.    Amongst a lot of old paper recently received at a mill in Andover,  Connecticut, was a Bible which some Goth had sold by weight.  In it was  an inscription, 'This Bible was used in the pulpit by Rev. Stephen West,  pastor in Stockbridge, Mass., from 1759 to 1818.'  This book was perhaps  not so important from a worldly point of view as 'The Art of Cookery  made Plain and Easy; By a Lady,' which the late Mr. Sala rescued from  oblivion in the Lambeth Marshes, as will shortly be related; but the  Rev. Stephen West was a very noted personage in his day, and there are  hundreds of people, more particularly in America, who would be very glad  to possess a memorial of him.  He was the author of the well-known  'Essay on Moral Agency,' 1794, the 'Sketches of the Life of the Rev. S.  Hopkins,' 1805, and other books which in their day enjoyed a very  extensive circulation.    Mr. Sala's discovery of Mrs. Glasse's cookery-book was due to his habit  of prowling round the old bookstalls of the Metropolis, particularly  those which line the narrow streets of Lambeth Marshes and the New Cut.  On a Sunday morning these places are like a fair, and, literally, scores  of peripatetic booksellers, who for the most part follow another  occupation the remaining days of the week, take their stand with barrows  piled high with lore.  The mob pull the volumes about, and haggle over  the prices, so that the stock displayed is not, on the whole, in the  best possible condition.  Still, sometimes you do meet with a  well-preserved rarity, as Mr. Sala did when he purchased 'The Art of  Cookery made Plain and Easy,' 1747, thin folio, for six humble pennies.  He had the book bound by a first-rate craftsman, and when it came at  last to the inevitable hammer some two or three years ago, it sold for  L10, and was reasonably worth considerably more.  Only five or six  copies of this edition are known to be in existence, but of the second  edition, which also appeared in 1747, only one copy is known, according  to the Rev. Richard Hooper, whose unique specimen contains an  inscription worth reproducing.  It runs as follows:    'Steal not this Book my honest Frend for Fear  the Galowss should be your hend and when  you Die the Lord will say and wares that Book  you stole away.'      Cooks are proverbially greasy people, and a book passing through their  hands is apt to return like 'Tom and Jerry' from those of a  prize-fighter or sporting publican.  Still, 201 persons subscribed to  the first edition of Mrs. Glasse, and 282 to the second, and some were  neither cooks nor publicans, but members of the aristocracy, who might  be expected to treat their books with some show of respect.  But perhaps  they expressly bought them for the use of their cooks, and handed them  over to the kitchen authorities, in which case their rarity is accounted  for.  All old cookery-books, and not merely Mrs. Glasse's famous work,  are rare, because they are books of practical utility meant to be  consulted in a republic of pots and pans, and grease and litter; but  Mrs. Glasse's guide is more desirable than most other English books of  the kind, because there is a sentiment hanging around it like a halo, by  reason of words which are not to be found therein, 'First catch your  hare.'    For my part, whenever I see a cookery-book flaunting it on a street  barrow, I rescue it at once, for I have a belief, rightly or wrongly,  that some of these days there will be a very great demand for old works  of the kind.  There is a present disposition to return to ancestral  dishes which means the resuscitation of 'The Skilful Cook,' 'The Good  Housewife's Jewel,' 'The Queen's Closet Opened,' 'The Ladies' Practice,'  and many other volumes where the necessary recipes are to be found.  For  some time past, indeed, recipe-books of all kinds have practically  disappeared from the stalls where once they were so numerous. 'They're  miking a lot of 'em hup at the West Hend,' said a stall proprietor,  jerking his thumb in the direction of Belgravia, from which it must be  understood, not that any manufactory of forgeries is as yet established  there, but merely that the upper ten think a great deal of old  recipe-books, and are buying them up for their cooks to practise with.    It is sadly to be feared that the paper-mills grind many good books  exceeding small at times. This is to be conjectured by reason of the  fact that every now and then a consignment is stopped and rescued just  as it is about to be transformed into pulp.  What happens once, is, we  may be sure, repeated at intervals, though direct evidence may be  wanting to convict the paper-maker. Evidence of this character is,  however, occasionally forthcoming, as, for example, in the case of the  sixth volume of Dr. Vallancey's 'Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis,' which  was published in two divisions in 1804.  The previous five volumes are  comparatively common, but both parts of volume six are very scarce,  nearly all the copies having been accidentally sold for waste-paper, and  treated as such.  Charles Dickens's 'Village Coquettes' and also  Swinburne's 'A Song of Italy' were once much rarer books than they are  now, and commanded a great deal more money in the market.  Neither book  sold well when published, and a very considerable 'remainder' was  stacked in quires in the publishers' cellars.  One day these Augean  stables were cleaned out, and the 'Village Coquettes' and 'A Song of  Italy' were saved from the mill by the merest of accidents, with the  result that the former book went down fifty per cent. in the market, and  the latter to next to nothing.  These finds were noised abroad, with the  result that they were robbed of most of their importance.  Imagine, if  we can, a great discovery of a hundred copies of Shakespeare's first  folio.  And imagine also a journal of credit getting hold of the news  and noising it abroad, as it would do when it had satisfied itself that  there was at least a substratum of truth in the story. The result we  know.  Half the value of the find would vanish away on the instant, and  rightly so, too, as a strict moralist would doubtless insist.    Sometimes, though not often, some of the literary auctioneers will make  a mistake, and in the most unaccountable manner include a rarity in a  'parcel' of rubbish.  A good copy of the first edition of Cocker's  'Decimal Arithmetic,' 1685, was picked up in this way a short time ago,  though not in London, and at Leeds a dealer bought an original and very  interesting letter in Shelley's autograph, which had somehow or other  slipped among a number of school-books of trifling value.  It is the  easiest thing in the world to make a mistake where books are concerned,  more particularly when they consist of pamphlets and other works which  lie in a small compass.  Folios can take care of themselves, but a man  needs to have a first-rate all-round knowledge who would essay to  catalogue a good old-fashioned miscellaneous library.    In France, sale-catalogues are prepared by experts, who are called in to  assist the auctioneers; in London the auctioneers keep their own  cataloguers, and in the country towns they seek the assistance of  booksellers, or do the work themselves.  If a sale is advertised to be  held at a house where furniture is the chief attraction, the presence of  a comparatively small number of books acts like a magnet, and people are  attracted from far and near in the hope that something good will fall to  their share.  Sometimes they are rewarded, more frequently not; for what  everybody is looking for is almost sure to be detected by several, if it  exist at all, and then, of course, the price is run up.  Still,  occasionally, a whole roomful of experts will miss a bargain which  stares them in the face. Unaccountable as it may seem, I myself once  bought for L1 a first-rate copy of Alken's 'National Sports of Great  Britain,' 1821, a scarce folio book full of coloured plates.  It was  wedged in among a quantity of furniture, and had escaped observation,  although there were several booksellers in the room.    The highest form of genius to be met with in book-men is, however, the  capacity possessed by a very few of them to detect the author of an  anonymous book by reference to the style in which it is written.  If we  happened to meet with 'Swellfoot the Tyrant' for a trifling sum, and  passed it by, we should deserve our fate, for the authorship is so  generally and widely known that there is no excuse for any book-man who  is unacquainted with the facts surrounding it. But were we to discover  another poem by Shelley, which no one had ever heard of before, and also  be able to prove conclusively that he must, _ex necessitate_, have been  the author of it, that indeed would be a triumph of skill.  Some few  books have been rescued in this way, 'Alaric at Rome,' for instance,  which was discovered and assigned to Matthew Arnold simply and solely by  reference to the style.  'Alaric at Rome' made a sensation when the  authorship came to be known, and book-hunters were searching high and  low, and giving commissions in hot haste.  A few copies were unearthed  in this way, but the number was exceedingly small, not more than two or  three, I believe, and the pamphlet, for it is nothing more, is at this  moment an object of deep interest to the few, who are in reality very  many, when we come to reflect that none but perhaps half a dozen can  ever hope to possess it.    When we get into bookland, more particularly into that secluded corner  of it where specialists assemble to compare notes and exhibit their  treasures, confusion springs up on the instant. The specialist cannot  always know his business thoroughly.  If you mention a particular book  which comes within his purview, he "]]]
