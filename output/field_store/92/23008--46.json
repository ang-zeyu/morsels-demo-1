But  if I were to buy a hundred sheep, and the grazier should bring me one  single wether fat and well fleeced by way of pattern, and expect the  same price for the whole hundred, without suffering me to see them  before he was paid or giving me good security to restore my money for  those that were lean, or shorn or scabby, I would be none of his  customers. I have heard of a man who had a mind to sell his house, and  therefore carried a piece of brick in his pocket, which he showed as a  pattern to encourage the purchasers; and this is directly the case in  point with Mr Wood's essay.]    [Note 29: The common soldier, when he goes to the market or ale  house will offer his money; and if it be refused, he perhaps will  swagger and hector, and threaten to beat the butcher or alewife, or  take the goods by force, and throw them the bad half-pence. In this  and the like cases, the shop-keeper or victualler, or any other  tradesman, has no more to do than to demand ten times the price of his  goods, if it is to be paid in Wood's money; for example twenty pence  of that money for a quart of ale, and so in all things, and never part  with the goods till he gets the money.]    [Note 30: Upon this rock the author is perpetually splitting, as  often as he ventures out beyond the narrow bounds of his literature.  He has a confused remembrance of words since he left the university,  but has lost half their meaning, and puts them together with no regard  except to their cadence; as I remember a fellow nailed up maps in a  gentleman's closet, some sidelong, others upside down, the better to  adjust them to the pannels.    Voyez aussi dans l'_Examiner_ le pamphlet sur Malborough, désigné sous  le nom de _Crassus_, et la comparaison de la générosité romaine et de  la ladrerie anglaise.]    [Note 31: I have had the honour of much conversation with his  lordship, and am thoroughly convinced how indifferent he is to  applause and how insensible of reproach.... He is without the sense of  shame or glory, as some men are without the sense of smelling;  therefore a good name to him is no more than a precious ointment would  be to these. Whoever, for the sake of others, were to describe the  nature of a serpent, a wolf, a crocodile or a fox, must be understood  to do it without any personal love or hatred for the animals  themselves. In the same manner his Excellency is one whom I neither  personally love or hate. I see him at court, at his own house, or  sometimes at mine, for I have the honour of his visits; and when these  papers are public, it is odds but he will tell me, as he once did upon  a like occasion, «that he is damnably mauled,» and then with the  easiest transition in the world, ask about the weather, or time of the  day. So that I enter on the work with more cheerfulness, because I am  sure neither to make him angry, nor any way to hurt his reputation; a  pitch of happiness and security to which his Excellency has arrived,  and which no philosopher before him could reach.--Thomas, Earl of  Wharton, lord lieutenant of Ireland, by the force of a wonderful  constitution, has some years passed his grand climacterick without any  visible effects of old age, either on his body or his mind and in  spite of a continual prostitution to those vices which usually wear  out both.... Whether he walks or whistles, or swears, or talks bawdy,  or calls names, he acquits himself in each beyond a templar of three  years standing. With the same grace and in the same style, he will  rattle his coachman in the midst of the street, where he is governor  of the kingdom; and all this is without consequence, because it is his  character, and what every body expects.... The ends he has gained by  lying appear to be more owing to the frequency than the art of them,  his lies being sometimes detected in an hour, often in a day, and  always in a week.... He swears solemnly he loves and will serve you,  and your back is no sooner turned, but he tells those about him you  are a dog and a rascal. He goes constantly to prayers in the forms of  his place, and will talk bawdy and blasphemy at the chapel door. He is  a presbyterian in politicks, and an atheist in religion, but he  chooses at present to whore with a papist. In his commerce with  mankind, his general rule is to endeavour to impose on their  understandings, for which he has but a receipt, a composition of lies  and oaths.... He bears the gallantries of his lady with the  indifference of a stoick, and thinks them well recompensed by a return  of children to support his family, without the fatigues of being a  father.... He was never known to refuse or to keep a promise, as I  remember he told a lady, but with an exception to the promise he then  made, which was to get her a pension. Yet he broke even that, and, I  confess, deceived us both. But here I desire to distinguish between a  promise and a bargain; for he will be sure to keep the latter, when he  has the fairest offer.... But here I must desire the reader's pardon,  if I cannot digest the following facts in so good a manner as I  intended; because it is thought expedient for some reasons, the world  should be informed of his Excellency's merits as soon as possible....  As they are, they may serve for hints to any person who may hereafter  have a mind to write memoirs of his Excellency's life.]    [Note 32: _Argument contre l'abolition du christianisme._ Il  s'agit de décrier les whigs, amis des libres penseurs.]    [Note 33: It may perhaps be neither safe nor prudent, to argue  against the abolishment of christianity, at a juncture, when all  parties appear so unanimously determined upon the point.... However I  know not how, whether from the affectation of singularity, or the  perverseness of human nature, but so it unhappily falls out, that I  cannot be entirely of this opinion. Nay, though I were sure an order  were issued for my immediate prosecution by the attorney-general, I  should still confess, that in the present posture of our affairs, at  home or abroad, I do not yet see the absolute necessity of extirpating  the christian religion from among us. This perhaps may appear too  great a paradox even for our wise and paradoxical age to endure;  therefore I shall handle it with all tenderness, and with the utmost  deference to that great and profound majority which is of another  sentiment.... I hope no reader imagines me so weak as to stand up in  the defence of real christianity, such as used in primitive times (if  we may believe the authors of those ages), to have an influence upon  men's belief and actions. To offer at the restoring of that would  indeed be a wild project; it would be to dig up foundations; to  destroy at one blow all the wit, and half the learning of the  kingdom.... Every candid reader will easily understand my discourse to  be intended only in defence of nominal christianity; the other having  been for some time wholly laid aside by general consent, as utterly  inconsistent with our present schemes of wealth and power.]    [Note 34: It is likewise urged, that there are by computation in  this kingdom above ten thousand parsons, whose revenues, added to  those of my lords the bishops, would suffice to maintain at least two  hundred young gentlemen of wit and pleasure, and freethinking, enemies  to priestcraft, narrow principles, pedantry, and prejudices, who might  be an ornament to the court and town.]    [Note 35: It is likewise proposed as a great advantage to the  publick that if we once discard the system of the Gospel, all religion  will of course be banished for ever, and consequently along with it,  those grievous prejudices of education, which under the names of  virtue, conscience, honour, justice, and the like, are so apt to  disturb the peace of human minds, and the notions thereof are so hard  to be eradicated by right reason, or free-thinking.]    [Note 36: I am very sensible how much the gentlemen of wit and  pleasure are apt to murmur and be shocked at the sight of so many  daggle-tail parsons, who happen to fall in their way, and offend their  eyes; but at the same time, those wise reformers do not consider what  an advantage and felicity it is for great wits to be always provided  with objects of scorn and contempt, in order to exercise and improve  their talents, and divert their spleen from falling on each other, or  on themselves; especially when all this may be done without the least  imaginable danger to their persons. And to urge another argument of a  parallel nature: if christianity were once abolished, how could the  freethinkers, the strong reasoners, and the men of profound learning,  be able to find another subject so calculated in all points whereon to  display their abilities? What wonderful productions of wit should we  be deprived of from those whose genius, by continual practice, hath  been wholly turned upon raillery and invectives against religion, and  would, therefore, be never able to shine or distinguish themselves on  any other subject? We are daily complaining of the great decline of  wit among us, and would we take away the greatest, perhaps the only  topic we have left?]    [Note 37: I do very much apprehend that in six months time after  the act is passed for the extirpation of the Gospel, the Bank and  East-India stock may fall at least one per cent. And since that is  fifty more than ever the wisdom of our age thought fit to venture for  the preservation of christianity, there is no reason why we should  bear so great a loss, merely for the sake of destroying it.]      IV    Le soir de la bataille, ordinairement on se délasse: on badine, on  raille, on cause, en prose, en vers; mais ce soir continue la journée,  et l'esprit qui a laissé sa trace dans les affaires laisse sa trace  dans les amusements.    Quoi de plus gai "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41114"],[0,"Histoire de la Littérature Anglaise (Volume 5 de 5) (#7)"],[1,"ses personnages dans l'absurde avec une  intrépidité rare. Son Pecksniff invente des phrases morales et des  actions sentimentales si grotesques qu'il en est extravagant. Jamais  on n'a entendu de telles monstruosités oratoires. Sheridan a déjà  peint un hypocrite anglais, Joseph Surface; mais celui-là diffère  autant de Pecksniff qu'un portrait du dix-huitième siècle diffère  d'une vignette du _Punch_. Dickens fait l'hypocrisie si difforme et si  énorme, que son hypocrite cesse de ressembler à un homme; on dirait  une de ces figures fantastiques dont le nez est plus gros que le  corps. Ce comique outré vient de l'imagination excessive. Dickens  emploie partout le même ressort. Pour mieux faire voir l'objet qu'il  montre, il en crève les yeux du lecteur; mais le lecteur s'amuse de  cette verve déréglée; la fougue de l'exécution lui fait oublier que la  scène est improbable, et il rit de grand coeur en entendant  l'entrepreneur des pompes funèbres, M. Mould, énumérer les  consolations que la piété filiale, bien munie d'argent, peut trouver  dans son magasin. Quelle douleur n'adouciraient pas les voitures à  quatre chevaux, les tentures de velours, les cochers en manteaux de  drap et en bottes à revers, les plumes d'autruche teintes en noir,  les acolytes à pied habillés dans le grand style, portant des bâtons  garnis de cuivre? Oh! ne disons pas que l'or est une boue, puisqu'il  peut acheter des choses comme celles-là? «Que de bénédictions, s'écrie  M. Mould, que de bénédictions j'ai versées sur l'humanité au moyen de  mes quatre grands chevaux caparaçonnés, que je ne caparaçonne jamais à  moins de 10 livres 10 shillings la course[8]!»    Ordinairement Dickens reste grave en traçant ses caricatures. L'esprit  anglais consiste à dire en style solennel des plaisanteries folles. Le  ton et les idées font alors contraste; tout contraste donne des  impressions fortes. Dickens aime à les produire, et son public à les  éprouver.    Si parfois il oublie de donner les verges au prochain, s'il essaye de  s'amuser, s'il se joue, il n'en est pas plus heureux. Le fond du  caractère anglais, c'est le manque de bonheur. L'ardente et tenace  imagination de Dickens se prend trop fortement aux choses pour glisser  légèrement et gaiement sur leur surface. Il appuie, il pénètre, il  enfonce, il creuse; toutes ces actions violentes sont des efforts, et  tous les efforts sont des souffrances. Pour être heureux, il faut être  léger comme un Français du dix-huitième siècle, ou sensuel comme un  Italien du seizième; il ne faut point s'inquiéter des choses ou en  jouir. Dickens s'en inquiète et n'en jouit pas. Prenez un petit  accident comique, comme on en rencontre dans la rue, un coup de vent  qui retrousse les habits d'un commissionnaire. Scaramouche fera une  grimace de bonne humeur; Lesage aura le sourire d'un homme amusé; tous  deux passeront et n'y songeront plus. Dickens y songe pendant une  demi-page. Il voit si bien tous les effets du vent, il se met si  complétement à sa place, il lui suppose une volonté si passionnée et  si précise, il tourne et retourne si fort et si longtemps les habits  du pauvre homme, il change le coup de vent en une tempête et en une  persécution si grandes, qu'on est pris de vertige, et que tout en  riant on se trouve en soi-même trop de trouble et trop de compassion  pour rire de bon coeur.         C'était un endroit aéré, qui bleuissait le nez, qui rougissait       les yeux, qui faisait venir la chair de poule, qui gelait les       doigts du pied, qui faisait claquer les dents, que l'endroit où       Toby Veck attendait en hiver, et Toby Veck le savait bien. Le       vent arrivait en se démenant autour du coin,--principalement le       vent d'est,--comme s'il était parti des confins de la terre pour       tomber sur Toby. Et souvent on aurait dit qu'il arrivait sur lui       plus tôt qu'il n'avait pensé, car tournant d'un bond autour du       coin et dépassant Toby, il revenait soudain sur lui-même en       tourbillonnant, comme s'il criait: Ah! le voilà! À l'instant, son       tablier blanc était relevé par dessus sa tête, comme la blouse       d'un enfant méchant, et l'on voyait sa faible petite canne lutter       et s'agiter inutilement dans sa main; ses jambes subissaient une       agitation terrible, et Toby lui-même tout courbé, faisant face       tantôt d'un côté, tantôt d'un autre, était si bien souffleté et       battu, et rossé, et houspillé, et tiraillé, et bousculé, et       soulevé de terre, que c'était presque positivement un miracle       s'il n'était pas enlevé en chair et en os en haut de l'air, comme       l'est parfois une colonie de grenouilles, ou d'escargots, ou       d'autres créatures portatives, pour tomber en pluie, au grand       étonnement des indigènes, dans quelque coin reculé du monde où       l'espèce des commissionnaires est inconnue[9].    Si l'on veut maintenant se figurer d'un regard cette imagination si  lucide, si violente, si passionnément fixée sur l'objet qu'elle se  choisit, si profondément touchée par les petites choses, si uniquement  attachée aux détails et aux sentiments de la vie vulgaire, si féconde  en émotions incessantes, si puissante pour éveiller la pitié  douloureuse, la raillerie sarcastique et la gaieté nerveuse, on se  représentera une rue de Londres par un soir pluvieux d'hiver. La  lumière flamboyante du gaz brûle les yeux, ruisselle à travers les  vitres des boutiques, rejaillit sur les figures qui passent, et sa  clarté crue, s'enfonçant dans leurs traits contractés, met en relief,  avec un détail infini et une énergie blessante, leurs rides, leurs  difformités, leur expression tourmentée. Si dans cette foule pressée  et salie vous découvrez un frais visage de jeune fille, cette lumière  artificielle le charge de tons excessifs et faux; elle le détache sur  l'ombre pluvieuse et froide avec une auréole étrange. L'esprit est  frappé d'étonnement: mais on porte la main à ses yeux pour les  couvrir, et en admirant la force de cette lumière, on pense  involontairement au vrai soleil de la campagne et à la tranquille  beauté du jour.    [Note 7: \"It ha' shined upon me,\" he said reverently, \"in my pain  and trouble down below. It ha' shined into my mind. I ha' lookn at't  an thowt o' thee, Rachael, till the muddle in my mind have cleared  away, above a bit, I hope.

I  awmust think it be the very star!\"    They carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and  over the wide landscape; Rachael always holding the hand in hers. Very  few whispers broke the mournful silence. It was soon a funeral  procession. The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor;  and through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his  Redeemer's rest. (_Hard Times_, p. 345.)]    [Note 8: \"It can give him,\" said Mr. Mould, waving his watch-chain  slowly round and round, so that he described one circle after every  item; \"it can give him four horses to each vehicle; it can give him  velvet trappings; it can give him drivers in cloth cloaks and  top-boots; it can give him the plumage of the ostrich, dyed black; it  can give him any number of walking attendants, drest in the first  style of funeral fashion, and carrying batons tipped with brass; it  can give him a place in Westminster Abbey itself, if he choose to  invest it in such a purchase. Oh! do not let us say that gold is  dross, when it can buy such things as these, Mrs. Gamp.\"    \"Ay, Mrs. Gamp, you are right,\" rejoined the undertaker. \"We should be  an honoured calling. We do good by stealth, and blush to have it  mentioned in our little bills. How much consolation may I--even  I\"--cried Mr. Mould, \"have diffused among my fellow-creatures by means  of my four longtailed prancers, never harnessed under ten pound ten!\"                                           (_Martin Chuzzlewit_, p. 349.)]    [Note 9: And a breezy, goose-skinned, blue-nosed, red-eyed,  stony-toed, tooth-chattering place it was, to wait in, in the  winter-time, as Toby Veck well knew. The wind came tearing round the  corner--especially the east wind--as if it had sallied forth, express,  from the confines of the earth, to have a blow at Toby. And  often-times it seemed to come upon him sooner than it had expected,  for bouncing round the corner, and passing Toby, it would suddenly  wheel round again, as if it cried: \"Why, here he is!\" Incontinently  his little white apron would be caught up over his head like a naughty  boy's garments, and his feeble little cane would be seen to wrestle  and struggle unavailingly in his hand, and his legs would undergo  tremendous agitation, and Toby himself all aslant, and facing now in  this direction, now in that, would be so banged and buffeted, and  touzled, and worried, and hustled, and lifted off his feet, as to  render it a state of things but one degree removed from a positive  miracle, that he wasn't carried up bodily into the air as a colony of  frogs or snails or other portable creatures sometimes are, and rained  down again, to the great astonishment of the natives, on some strange  corner of the world where ticket-porters are unknown.
