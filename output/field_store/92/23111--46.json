Yet hear you nothing from such man but works;  They make the Christian service like the Turks.     \"Hark to the Churchman:  day by day he cries,  'Children of Men, be virtuous and be wise:  Seek patience, justice, temp'rance, meekness, truth;  In age be courteous, be sedate in youth.' -  So they advise, and when such things be read,  How can we wonder that their flocks are dead?  The Heathens wrote of Virtue:  they could dwell  On such light points:  in them it might be well;  They might for virtue strive; but I maintain,  Our strife for virtue would be proud and vain.  When Samson carried Gaza's gates so far,  Lack'd he a helping hand to bear the bar?  Thus the most virtuous must in bondage groan:  Samson is grace, and carries all alone.     \"Hear you not priests their feeble spirits spend,  In bidding Sinners turn to God, and mend;  To check their passions and to walk aright,  To run the Race, and fight the glorious Fight?  Nay more--to pray, to study, to improve,  To grow in goodness, to advance in love?     \"Oh! Babes and Sucklings, dull of heart and slow,  Can Grace be gradual?  Can Conversion grow?  The work is done by instantaneous call;  Converts at once are made, or not at all;  Nothing is left to grow, reform, amend,  The first emotion is the Movement's end:  If once forgiven, Debt can be no more;  If once adopted, will the heir be poor?  The man who gains the twenty-thousand prize,  Does he by little and by little rise?  There can no fortune for the Soul be made,  By peddling cares and savings in her trade.     \"Why are our sins forgiven?--Priests reply,  - Because by Faith on Mercy we rely;  'Because, believing, we repent and pray.'  Is this their doctrine?--then they go astray;  We're pardon'd neither for belief nor deed,  For faith nor practice, principle nor creed;  Nor for our sorrow for our former sin,  Nor for our fears when better thoughts begin;  Nor prayers nor penance in the cause avail,  All strong remorse, all soft contrition fail:  It is the Call! till that proclaims us free,  In darkness, doubt, and bondage we must be;  Till that assures us, we've in vain endured,  And all is over when we're once assured.     \"This is Conversion: --First there comes a cry  Which utters, 'Sinner, thou'rt condemned to die;'  Then the struck soul to every aid repairs,  To church and altar, ministers and prayers;  In vain she strives,--involved, ingulf'd in sin,  She looks for hell, and seems already in:  When in this travail, the New Birth comes on,  And in an instant every pang is gone;  The mighty work is done without our pains, -  Claim but a part, and not a part remains.     \"All this experience tells the Soul, and yet  These moral men their pence and farthings set  Against the terrors of the countless Debt;  But such compounders, when they come to jail,  Will find that Virtues never serve as bail.     \"So much to duties:  now to Learning look,  And see their priesthood piling book on book;  Yea, books of infidels, we're told, and plays,  Put out by heathens in the wink'd-on days;  The very letters are of crooked kind,  And show the strange perverseness of their mind.  Have I this Learning?  When the Lord would speak;  Think ye he needs the Latin or the Greek?  And lo! with all their learning, when they rise  To preach, in view the ready sermon lies;  Some low-prized stuff they purchased at the stalls,  And more like Seneca's than mine or Paul's:  Children of Bondage, how should they explain  The Spirit's freedom, while they wear a chain?  They study words, for meanings grow perplex d,  And slowly hunt for truth from text to text,  Through Greek and Hebrew: --we the meaning seek  Of that within, who every tongue can speak:  This all can witness; yet the more I know,  The more a meek and humble mind I show.     \"No; let the Pope, the high and mighty priest,  Lord to the poor, and servant to the Beast;  Let bishops, deans, and prebendaries swell  With pride and fatness till their hearts rebel:  I'm meek and modest: --if I could be proud,  This crowded meeting, lo! th' amazing crowd!  Your mute attention, and your meek respect,  My spirit's fervour, and my words' effect,  Might stir th' unguarded soul; and oft to me  The Tempter speaks, whom I compel to flee;  He goes in fear, for he my force has tried, -  Such is my power! but can you call it pride?     \"No, Fellow-Pilgrims! of the things I've shown  I might be proud, were they indeed my own!  But they are lent:  and well you know the source  Of all that's mine, and must confide of course:  Mine! no, I err; 'tis but consigned to me,  And I am nought but steward and trustee.\"               --------------------------       FAR other Doctrines yon Arminian speaks;  \"Seek Grace,\" he cries, \"for he shall find who seeks.\"  This is the ancient stock by Wesley led;  They the pure body, he the reverend head:  All innovation they with dread decline,  Their John the elder was the John divine.  Hence, still their moving prayer, the melting hymn,  The varied accent, and the active limb:  Hence that implicit faith in Satan's might,  And their own matchless prowess in the fight.  In every act they see that lurking foe,  Let loose awhile, about the world to go;  A dragon flying round the earth, to kill  The heavenly hope, and prompt the carnal will;  Whom sainted knights attack in sinners' cause,  And force the wounded victim from his paws;  Who but for them would man's whole race subdue,  For not a hireling will the foe pursue.     \"Show me one Churchman who will rise and pray  Through half the night, though lab'ring all the day,  Always abounding--show me him, I say:\" -  Thus cries the Preacher, and he adds, \"Their sheep  Satan devours at leisure as they sleep.  Not so with us; we drive him from the fold,  For ever barking and for ever bold:  While they securely slumber, all his schemes  Take full effect,--the Devil never dreams:  Watchful and changeful through the world he goes,  And few can trace this deadliest of their foes;  But I detect, and at his work surprise  The subtle Serpent under all disguise.     \"Thus to Man's soul the Foe of Souls will speak,  - 'A Saint elect, you can have nought to seek;  Why all this labour in so plain a case,  Such care to run, when certain of the race?'  All this he urges to the carnal will,  He knows you're slothful, and would have you still:  Be this your answer,--'Satan, I will keep  Still on the watch till you are laid asleep.'  Thus too the Christian's progress he'll retard:  -  'The gates of mercy are for ever barr'd;  And that with bolts so driven and so stout,  Ten thousand workmen cannot wrench them out.'  To this deceit you have but one reply, -  Give to the Father of all Lies the lie.     \"A Sister's weakness he'll by fits surprise,  His her wild laughter, his her piteous cries;  And should a pastor at her side attend,  He'll use her organs to abuse her friend:  These are possessions--unbelieving wits  Impute them all to Nature:  'They're her fits,  Caused by commotions in tne nerves and brains;' -  Vain talk! but they'll be fitted for their pains.     \"These are in part the ills the Foe has wrought,  And these the Churchman thinks not worth his thought;  They bid the troubled try for peace and rest,  Compose their minds, and be no more distress'd;  As well might they command the passive shore  To keep secure, and be o'erflow'd no more;  To the wrong subject is their skill applied, -  To act like workmen, they should stem the tide.     \"These are the Church-Physicians:  they are paid  With noble fees for their advice and aid;  Yet know they not the inward pulse to feel,  To ease the anguish, or the wound to heal.  With the sick Sinner, thus their work begins:  'Do you repent you of your former sins?  Will you amend if you revive and live?  And, pardon seeking, will you pardon give?  Have you belief in what your Lord has done,  And are you thankful?--all is well my son.'     \"A way far different ours--we thus surprise  A soul with questions, and demand replies:  'How dropp'd you first,' I ask, 'the legal Yoke?  What the first word the living Witness spoke?  Perceived you thunders roar and lightnings shine,  And tempests gathering ere the Birth divine?

Then in thy way didst thou thy foe attack,  And mad'st thou proud Apollyon turn his back?'     \"Heart-searching things are these, and shake the mind,  Yea, like the rustling of a mighty wind.     \"Thus would I ask:  'Nay, let me question now,  How sink my sayings in your bosoms? how?

When we had  reached the depths of the grove, where we were in safety, we thoroughly  discussed the surest method of secreting our gold, so that we would  neither be accused of robbery nor robbed ourselves, and we finally  decided to sew it into the hem of a ragged tunic, which I threw over my  shoulders, after having turned the mantle over to Ascyltos for  safekeeping; we then made ready to start for the city via the  unfrequented roads.  We were just about to emerge from the shelter of  the wood when we heard, from somewhere on our left, \"They can't get away,  they came into this wood; let's spread out and beat, and they will easily  be caught!\"  On hearing this, we were thrown into such a terrible fright  that Ascyltos and Giton dashed away city-ward, through the underbrush,  and I retreated in such a hurry that the precious tunic slipped off my  shoulders without my knowing it.  At last, completely fagged out, and  unable to take another step, I lay down under a tree, and there I first  became aware of the loss of the tunic.  Chagrin restored my strength and  I leaped to my feet to look for the treasure, and for a long time I beat  around in vain.  Worn out with work and vexation, I forced my way into  the thickest part of the grove and remained there for four mortal hours,  but at last, bored to extinction by the horrible solitude, I sought a way  out.  As I went ahead, I caught sight of a peasant; then I had need of  all my nerve, and it did not fail me.  Marching boldly up to him, I asked  my way to the city, complaining that I had been lost in the wood for  several hours.  Seeing my condition, he took pity upon me, for I was  covered with mud and paler than death, and asked me whether I had seen  anyone in the place.  \"Not a soul,\" I replied, whereupon he kindly  conducted me to the high road, where he met two of his companions, who  informed him that they had beaten along every path in the forest without  having found anything except a tunic, which they showed him.  As may be  readily supposed, I did not have the audacity to claim it, though well  aware of its value, and my chagrin became almost insupportable as I  vented many a groaning curse over my lost treasure.  The peasants paid  no attention to me, and I was gradually left behind, as my weakness  increased my pace decreased.  For this reason, it was late when I reached  the city, and, entering the inn, beheld Ascyltos, stretched out, half  dead, upon a cot.  Too far gone to utter a single syllable, I threw  myself upon another.  Ascyltos became greatly excited at not seeing the  tunic which he had entrusted to me, demanding it insistently, but I was  so weak that my voice refused its office and I permitted the apathy of my  eyes to answer his demand, then, by and by, regaining my strength little  by little, I related the whole affair to Ascyltos, in every detail.  He  thought that I was joking, and although my testimony was fortified by a  copious flood of tears, it could easily be seen that he remained  unconvinced, believing that I wanted to cheat him out of the gold.  Giton, who was standing by during all this, was as downcast as myself,  and the suffering of the lad only served to increase my own vexation, but  the thing which bothered me most of all, was the painstaking search which  was being made for us; I told Ascyltos of this, but he only laughed it  off, as he had so happily extricated himself from the scrape.  He was  convinced that, as we were unknown and as no one had seen us, we were  perfectly safe.  We decided, nevertheless, to feign sickness, and to keep  to our room as long as possible; but, before we knew it, our money ran  out, and spurred by necessity we were forced to go abroad and sell some  of our plunder.)          CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.    Twilight was falling, as we entered the market-place, in which we noticed  a quantity of things for sale, not any of much value, it is true, but  such as could be disposed of to the best advantage when the semi-darkness  would serve to hide their doubtful origin.  As we had brought our stolen  mantle, we proceeded to make use of so favorable an opportunity, and, in  a secluded spot, displayed a corner of it, hoping the splendid garment  would attract some purchaser.  Nor was it long before a certain peasant,  whose face was familiar to my eyes, came up, accompanied by a young  woman, and began to examine the garment very closely.  Ascyltos, in turn,  cast a glance at the shoulders of our rustic customer, and was instantly  struck dumb with astonishment.  Nor could I myself look upon this man  without some emotion, for he seemed to be the identical person who had  picked up the ragged tunic in the lonely wood, and, as a matter of fact,  he was!  Ascyltos, afraid to believe the evidence of his own eyes for  fear of doing something rash, approached the man, as a prospective buyer,  took the hem of the tunic from the rustic's shoulders, and felt it  thoroughly.          CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.    Oh wonderful stroke of Fortune!  The peasant had not yet laid his  meddling hands upon the seams, but was scornfully offering the thing for  sale, as though it had been the leavings of some beggar.  When Ascyltos  had assured himself that the hoard was intact, and had taken note of the  social status of the seller, he led me a little aside from the crowd and  said, \"Do you know, 'brother,' that the treasure about which I was so  worked up has come back to us?  That is the little tunic, and it seems  that the gold pieces are still untouched.  What ought we to do, and how  shall we make good our claim?\"  I was overjoyed, not so much at seeing  our booty, as I was for the reason that Fortune had released me from a  very ugly suspicion.  I was opposed to doing anything by devious methods,  thinking that should he prove unwilling to restore to the proper owner an  article not his own, it ought to come to a civil action and a judgment  secured.          CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.    Not so Ascyltos, who was afraid of the law, and demurred, \"Who knows us  here?  Who will place any credence in anything we say?  It seems to me  that it would be better to buy, ours though it is, and we know it, and  recover the treasure at small cost, rather than to engage in a doubtful  lawsuit.\"              Of what avail are any laws, where money rules alone,              Where Poverty can never win its cases?              Detractors of the times, who bear the Cynic's scrip, are known              To often sell the truth, and keep their faces!              So Justice is at public auction bought,              The knight gives judgement as Gold says he ought.    But, with the exception of a two-as piece with which we had intended  purchasing peas and lupines, there was nothing to hand; so, for fear our  loot should escape us in the interim, we resolved to appraise the mantle  at less, and, through a small sacrifice, secure a greater profit.  Accordingly, we spread it out, and the young woman of the covered head,  who was standing by the peasant's side, narrowly inspected the markings,  seized the hem with both hands, and screamed \"Thieves!\" at the top of her  voice.  We were greatly disconcerted at this and, for fear that  inactivity on our part should seem to lend color to her charges, we  laid hold of the dirty ragged tunic, in our turn, and shouted with equal  spite, that this was our property which they had in their possession; but  our cases were by no means on an equality, and the hucksters who had  crowded around us at the uproar, laughed at our spiteful claim, and very  naturally, too, since one side laid claim to a very valuable mantle,  while the other demanded a rag which was not worth a good patch.          CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.    Ascyltos, when he had secured silence, adroitly put a stop to their  laughter by exclaiming, \"We can see that each puts the greater value upon  his own property.  Let them return our tunic to us, and take back their  mantle!\"  This exchange was satisfactory enough to the peasant and the  young woman, but some night-prowling shyster lawyers, who wished to get  possession of the mantle for their own profit, demanded that both  articles be deposited with them, and the judge could look into the case  on the morrow, for it would appear that the ownership of the articles was  not so much to the point as was the suspicion of robbery that attached  to both sides.  The question of sequestration arose, and one of the  hucksters, I do not remember which, but he was bald, and his forehead was  covered with sebaceous wens, and he sometimes did odd jobs for the  lawyers, seized the mantle and vowed that HE would see to it that it was  produced at the proper time and place, but it was easily apparent that he  desired nothing but that the garment should be deposited with thieves,  and vanish; thinking that we would be afraid to appear as claimants for  fear of being charged with crime.  As far as we were concerned, we were  as willing as he, and Fortune aided the cause of each of us, for the  peasant, infuriated at our demand that his rags be shown in public, threw  the tunic in Ascyltos' face, released us from responsibility, and  demanded that the mantle, which was the only object of litigation, be  sequestered.  As we thought we had recovered our treasure, we returned  hurriedly to the inn, and fastening the door, we had a good laugh at the  shrewdness of the hucksters, and not less so at that of our enemies, for  by it they had returned our money to us.  (While we were unstitching the  tunic to get at the gold pieces, we overheard some one quizzing the  innkeeper as to what kind of people those were, who had just entered his  house.  Alarmed at this inquiry, I went down, when the questioner had  gone, to find out what was the matter, and learned"]]]
