It is,  we repeat, a spiritual sense opening inwardly, as the physical  senses open outwardly; and because it has the capacity to perceive,  grasp, and know the truth at first hand, independent of all external  sources of information, we call it intuition. All inspired teaching  and spiritual revelations are based upon the recognition of this  spiritual faculty of the soul and its power to receive and  appropriate them. Conscious unity of man in spirit and purpose with  the Father, born out of his supreme desire and trust, opens his soul  through this inner sense to immediate aspiration and enlightenment  from the divine omniscience, and the co-operative energy of the  divine omnipotence, under which he becomes a seer and a master. On  this higher plane of realised spiritual life in the flesh the mind  acts with unfettered freedom and unbiassed vision, grasping truth at  first hand, independent of all external sources of information.  Approaching all beings and things from the divine side, they are  seen in the light of the divine omniscience.[35] God's purpose in  them, and so the truth concerning them, as it rests in the mind of  God, are thus revealed by direct illumination from the divine mind,  to which the soul is opened inwardly through this spiritual sense we  call intuition.\"    The practice of meditation \"without images,\" as the mediaeval  mystics called it, is specially recommended. \"Many will receive  great help, and many will be entirely healed by a practice somewhat  after the following nature:--With a mind at peace, and with a heart  going out in love to all, go into the quiet of your own interior  self, holding the thought, I am one with the Infinite Spirit of  Life, the life of my life. I now open my body, in which disease has  gotten a foothold, I open it fully to the inflowing tide of this  infinite life, and it now, even now, is pouring in and coursing  through my body, and the healing process is going on.\" \"If you would  find the highest, the fullest, and the richest life that not only  this world but that any world can know, then do away with the sense  of the separateness of your life from the life of God. Hold to the  thought of your oneness. In the degree that you do this, you will  find yourself realising it more and more, and as this life of  realisation is lived, you will find that no good thing will be  withheld, for all things are included in this.\"[36]    This modern mysticism is very much entangled with theories about the  cure of bodily disease by suggestion; and it is fair to warn those  who are unacquainted with the books of this sect that they will find  much fantastic superstition mixed with a stimulating faith in the  inner light as the voice of God.    But whatever may be the course of this particular movement there can  be no doubt that the Americans, like ourselves, are only at the  beginning of a great revival of mystical religion. The movement will  probably follow the same course as the mediaeval movement in  Germany, with which this little book is concerned. It will have its  philosophical supportees, who will press their speculation to the  verge of Pantheism, perhaps reviving the Logos-cosmology of the  Christian Alexandrians under the form of the pan-psychism of Lotze  and Fechner. It will have its evangelists like Tauler, who will  carry to our crowded town populations the glad tidings that the  kingdom of God is not here or there, but within the hearts of all  who will seek for it within them. It will assuredly attract some to  a life of solitary contemplation; while others, intellectually  weaker or less serious, will follow the various theosophical and  theurgical delusions which, from the days of Iamblichus downward,  have dogged the heels of mysticism. For the \"False Light\" against  which the \"Theologia Germanica\" warns us is as dangerous as ever; we  may even live to see some new \"Brethren of the Free Spirit\" turning  their liberty into a cloak of licentiousness. If so, the world will  soon whistle back the disciplinarian with his traditions of the  elders; prophesying will once more be suppressed and discredited,  and a new crystallising process will begin. But before that time  comes some changes may possibly take place in the external  proportions of Christian orthodoxy. The appearance of a vigorous  body of faith, standing firmly on its own feet, may even have the  effect of relegating to the sphere of pious opinion some tenets  which have hitherto \"seemed to be pillars.\"    For these periodical returns to the \"fresh springs\" of religion  never leave the tradition exactly where it was before. The German  movement of the fourteenth century made the Reformation inevitable,  and our own age may be inaugurating a change no less momentous,  which will restore in the twentieth century some of the features of  Apostolic Christianity.              LIGHT, LIFE AND LOVE    ECKHART            GOD    GOD is nameless, for no man can either say or understand aught about  Him. If I say, God is good, it is not true; nay more; I am good, God  is not good. I may even say, I am better than God; for whatever is  good, may become better, and whatever may become better, may become  best. Now God is not good, for He cannot become better. And if He  cannot become better, He cannot become best, for these three things,  good, better, and best, are far from God, since He is above all. If  I also say, God is wise, it is not true; I am wiser than He. If I  also say, God is a Being, it is not true; He is transcendent Being  and superessential Nothingness. Concerning this St Augustine says:  the best thing that man can say about God is to be able to be silent  about Him, from the wisdom of his inner judgement. Therefore be  silent and prate not about God, for whenever thou dost prate about  God, thou liest, and committest sin. If thou wilt be without sin,  prate not about God. Thou canst understand nought about God, for He  is above all understanding. A master saith: If I had a God whom I  could understand, I would never hold Him to be God. (318)[37]    God is not only a Father of all good things, as being their First  Cause and Creator, but He is also their Mother, since He remains  with the creatures which have from Him their being and existence,  and maintains them continually in their being. If God did not abide  with and in the creatures, they must necessarily have fallen back,  so soon as they were created, into the nothingness out of which they  were created. (610)    REST ONLY IN GOD    IF I had everything that I could desire, and my finger ached, I  should not have everything, for I should have a pain in my finger,  and so long as that remained, I should not enjoy full comfort. Bread  is comfortable for men, when they are hungry; but when they are  thirsty, they find no more comfort in bread than in a stone. So it  is with clothes, they are welcome to men, when they are cold; but  when they are too hot, clothes give them no comfort. And so it is  with all the creatures. The comfort which they promise is only on  the surface, like froth, and it always carries with it a want. But  God's comfort is clear and has nothing wanting: it is full and  complete, and God is constrained to give it thee, for He cannot  cease till He have given thee Himself. (300)    It is only in God that are collected and united all the perfections,  which in the creatures are sundered and divided. (324)    Yet all the fulness of the creatures can as little express God, as a  drop of water can express the sea. (173)    GOD IS ALWAYS READY    NO one ought to think that it is difficult to come to Him, though it  sounds difficult and is really difficult at the beginning, and in  separating oneself from and dying to all things. But when a man has  once entered upon it, no life is lighter or happier or more  desirable; for God is very zealous to be at all times with man, and  teaches him that He will bring him to Himself if man will but  follow. Man never desires anything so earnestly as God desires to  bring a man to Himself, that he may know Him. God is always ready,  but we are very unready; God is near to us, but we are far from Him;  God is within, but we are without; God is at home, but we are  strangers. The prophet saith: God guideth the redeemed through a  narrow way into the broad road, so that they come into the wide and  broad place; that is to say, into true freedom of the spirit, when  one has become a spirit with God. May God help us to follow this  course, that He may bring us to Himself. Amen. (223)    GRACE    THE masters say: That is young, which is near its beginning.  Intelligence is the youngest faculty in man: the first thing to  break out from the soul is intelligence, the next is will, the other  faculties follow. Now he saith: Young man, I say unto thee, arise.  The soul in itself is a simple work; what God works in the simple  light of the soul is more beautiful and more delightful than all the  other works which He works in all creatures. But foolish people take  evil for good and good for evil. But to him who rightly understands,  the one work which God works in the soul is better and nobler and  higher than all the world. Through that light comes grace. Grace  never comes in the intelligence or in the will. If it could come in  the intelligence or in the will, the intelligence and the will would  have to transcend themselves. On this a master says: There is  something secret about it; and thereby he means the spark of the  soul, which alone can apprehend God. The true union between God and  the soul takes place in the little spark, which is called the spirit  of the soul. Grace unites not to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#7)"],[1,"the  Dutch doctor would have said, \"bewitched\" to go back, and at last, after  five happy months in Goshen, in an evil hour I consented to go home with  her.        CHAPTER V. HOW THE SCHEIMERS MADE ME SUFFER.    RETURN TO SCHEIMER--PEACE AND THEN PANDEMONIUM--FRIGHTFUL FAMILY  ROW--RUNNING FOR REFUGE--THE GANG AGAIN--ARREST AT MIDNIGHT--STRUGGLE  WITH MY CAPTORS--IN JAIL ONCE MORE--PUT IN IRONS--A HORRIBLE PRISON  BREAKING OUT--THE DUNGEON--SARAH'S BABY--CURIOUS COMPROMISES--OLD  SCHEIMER MY JAILER--SIGNING A BOND--FREE AGAIN--LAST WORDS FROM SARAH.        We went back to the Scheimer homestead and were favorably received.  There was no special enthusiasm over our return, no marked  demonstrations of delight; but they seemed glad to see us, and all the  unpleasant things of the past, if not forgotten, were tacitly ignored  on all sides. We passed a pleasant evening together in what seemed a  re-united family circle--one of the brothers only was absent--and next  morning we met cordially around the breakfast table. I really began to  think it was possible that all the old difficulties might be healed, and  that the pleasant picture Sarah painted, at Goshen, about settling down  happily in Pennsylvania, could be fully realized.    After breakfast I took a conveyance to go three or four miles to see a  man who owed me some money for medical services in his family, and was  away from Scheimer's three or four hours. During this brief absence I  could not help thinking with genuine satisfaction of the happiness Sarah  was experiencing in the gratification of her longing to return home  again. Surely, I thought, she must be happy now. No more homesickness,  and a full and complete reconciliation with her family; all the anger,  abuse, and blows forgotten or forgiven; she restored to her place in the  family; and even her objectionable husband received with open arms.    But what an enormous difference there is between fancy and fact. During  this brief absence of mine, had come home the brother who had always  seemed to concentrate the hatred of the whole family towards me for the  wrong they assumed I had done to the youngest daughter who loved me.  On my return I found the peaceful home I left in the morning a perfect  pandemonium. Sarah was fairly frantic. The whole family were abusing  her. The returned brother especially, was calling her all the vile names  he could lay his tongue to. I learned afterwards that he had been doing  it ever since he came into the house that day and found her at home and  heard that I was with her. They had picked, wrenched rather, out of her  the secret I had confided to her that I had another wife from whom I was  \"separated,\" but not divorced. My sudden presence on this scene was not  exactly oil on troubled waters; it was gunpowder to fire. As soon as  Sarah saw me at the door she cried out:    \"O! husband, let us go away from here.\"    Her mother turned and shouted at me that I had better fly at once or  they would kill me. Meanwhile, that mob, which the Scheimer boys seemed  always to have at hand, was gathering in the dooryard. I managed to get  near enough to Sarah to tell her that I would send a man for her next  day, and then if she was willing to come with me she must get away  from her family if possible. I then made a rush through the crowd, and  reached the road. I think the gang had an indistinct knowledge of the  situation, or they would have mobbed me, and perhaps killed me. They  knew something was \"to pay\" at Scheimer's, but did not know exactly  what. Once on the road it was my intention to have gone over to  Belvidere, and then on to Oxford, where I should have found a sure  refuge with my friend Boston Yankee.    Would that I had done so; but I was a fool; I thought I could be of  service to Sarah by remaining near her; might see her next day; I might  even be able to get her out of the house, and then we could once more  elope together and go back again to Goshen where we had been so happy.  So I went to a public house three miles above Scheimer's, and remained  there quietly during the rest of the day, revolving plans for the  deliverance of Sarah. I thought only of her. It is strange that I did  not once realize what a perilous position I was in myself--that, firmly  as I believed myself to be wedded to Sarah, I was in fact amenable to  the law, and liable to arrest and punishment. All this never occurred to  me. I saw one or two of the gang who were at Scheimer's about the hotel,  but they did not offer to molest me, and I paid no particular attention  to them. I did not know then that they were spies and were watching my  movements. At nine o'clock I went to bed. At midnight, or thereabouts,  I was roughly awakened and told to get up. Without waiting for me,  to comply, five men who had entered my room pulled me out of bed, and  almost before I could huddle on my clothes I was handcuffed. Then one of  them, who said he was a constable from Easton, showed a warrant for my  arrest. What the arrest was for I was not informed. I was taken down  stairs, put into a wagon, the men followed, and the horses started in  the direction of Easton. By Scheimer's on the way, and I could see a  light in Sarah's window. I remembered how in, all the Bedlam in  the house that morning she still cried out: \"I will go with him.\" I  remembered how, only a few months before, she had been brutally flogged  in that very chamber, to \"get the devil out of her.\" I remembered, too,  the many happy, happy hours we had passed together. And here was I,  handcuffed and dragged in a wagon, I knew not whither.    This for thoughts--in the way of action, was all the while trying to  get my handcuffs off, and at last I succeeded in getting one hand free.  Waiting my opportunity till we came to a piece of woods, I suddenly  jumped up and sprang from the wagon. It was a very dark night, and in  running into the woods I struck against a tree with such force as  to knock me down and nearly stun me. Two of the men were on me in an  instant. After a brief struggle I managed to get away and ran again. I  should have escaped, only a high rail fence brought me to a sudden stop,  and I was too exhausted to climb over it. My pursuers who were hard at  my heels the whole while now laid hold of me. In the subsequent struggle  I got out my pocket knife, and stabbed one of them, cutting his arm  badly. Then they overpowered me. They dragged me to the roadside,  brought a rope out of the wagon, bound my arms and legs, and so at last  carried me to Easton.    It was nearly daylight when I was thrust into jail. There were no cells,  only large rooms for a dozen or more men, and I was put, into one of  these with several prisoners who were awaiting trial, or who had been  tried and were there till they could be sent to prison. It was a day  or two before I found out what I was there for. Then a Dutch Deputy  Sheriff, who was also keeper of the jail, came and told me that I was  held for bigamy, adding the consoling intelligence that it would be a  very hard job for me, and that I would get five or six years in State  prison sure. I was well acquainted in Easton, and I sent for lawyer  Litgreave for assistance and advice. I sent also to my half-sister in  Delaware County, N. Y., and in a day or two she came and saw me, and  gave Mr. Litgreave one hundred dollars retaining fee. My lawyer went to  see the Scheimers and when he returned he told me that he hoped to save  me from State prison--at all events he would exercise the influence he  had over the family to that end; but I must expect to remain in jail a  long time. Precisely what this meant I did not know then; but I found  out afterwards.    Soon after this visit from the lawyer, the Deputy Sheriff came in and  said that he was ordered \"by the Judge\" to iron me, and it was done.  They were heavy leg-irons weighing full twelve pounds, and I may say  here that I wore them during the whole term of my imprisonment in this  jail, or rather they wore me--wearing their way in time almost into  the bone. I had been here a week now, and was well acquainted with the  character of the place. It was indescribably filthy; no pretence was  made of cleansing it. The prisoners were half fed, and, at that, the  food was oftentimes so vile that starving men rejected it. The deputy  who kept the jail was cruel and malignant, and took delight in torturing  his prisoners. He would come in sometimes under pretence of looking at  my irons to see if they were safe, and would twist and turn them about  so that I suffered intolerable pain, and blood flowed from my wounds  made by these cruel irons. Such abuse as he could give with his tongue  he dispensed freely. Of course he was a coward, and he never dared to  come into one of the prisoner's rooms unless he was armed. This is a  faithful photograph of the interior of the jail at Easton, Penn., as  it was a few years ago; there may have been some improvement since that  time; for the sake of humanity, I hope there has been.    After I had been in this jail about six weeks, and had become well  acquainted with my room-mates, I communicated to them one day, the  result of my observation:    \"There,\" said I, showing them a certain place in the wall, \"is a loose  stone that with a little labor can be lifted out, and it will leave a  hole large enough for us to get out of and go where we like.\"    Examination elicited a unanimous verdict in favor of making the attempt.  With no tools but a case knife we dug out the mortar on all sides of the  stone doing the work by turns and covering the stone by hanging up an  old blanket--which excited no suspicion, as it was at the head of one of  the iron bedsteads--whenever the Deputy or any of his men were likely to  visit us. In twelve days we completed the work, and could lift out the  stone. The hole was large enough to let a man through, and there was  nothing for us to do but to crawl"]]]
