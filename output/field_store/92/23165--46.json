Her hands were very slender and beautiful, and  when, as the Colonel presented us, she extended her fingers, I was not  surprised to see Harley stoop and kiss them in Continental fashion;  for this Madame evidently expected. I followed suit; but truth to tell,  after that first glance at the masterful figure in the invalid chair I  had had no eyes for Madame de Staemer, being fully employed in gazing at  someone who stood beside her.    This was an evasively pretty girl, or such was my first impression. That  is to say, that whilst her attractiveness was beyond dispute, analysis  of her small features failed to detect from which particular quality  this charm was derived. The contour of her face certainly formed a  delightful oval, and there was a wistful look in her eyes which was half  appealing and half impish. Her demure expression was not convincing, and  there rested a vague smile, or promise of a smile, upon lips which were  perfectly moulded, and indeed the only strictly regular feature of a  nevertheless bewitching face. She had slightly curling hair and the line  of her neck and shoulder was most graceful and charming. Of one thing I  was sure: She was glad to see visitors at Cray's Folly.    \"And now, gentlemen,\" said Colonel Menendez, \"having presented you to  Madame, my cousin, permit me to present you to Miss Val Beverley, my  cousin's companion, and our very dear friend.\"    The girl bowed in a formal English fashion, which contrasted sharply  with the Continental manner of Madame. Her face flushed slightly, and as  I met her glance she lowered her eyes.    \"Now M. Harley and M. Knox,\" said Madame, vivaciously, \"you are quite at  home. Pedro will show you to your rooms and lunch will be ready in half  an hour.\"    She waved her white hand coquettishly, and ignoring the proffered aid  of Miss Beverley, wheeled her chair away at a great rate under a sort  of arch on the right of the hall, which communicated with the domestic  offices of the establishment.    \"Is she not wonderful?\" exclaimed Colonel Menendez, taking Harley's  left arm and my right and guiding us upstairs followed by Pedro and  the chauffeur, the latter carrying our grips. \"Many women would be  prostrated by such an affliction, but she--\" he shrugged his shoulders.    Harley and I had been placed in adjoining rooms. I had never seen such  rooms as those in Cray's Folly. The place contained enough oak to have  driven a modern builder crazy. Oak had simply been lavished upon it. My  own room, which was almost directly above the box hedge to which I have  referred, had a beautiful carved ceiling and a floor as highly polished  as that of a ballroom. It was tastefully furnished, but the foreign note  was perceptible everywhere.    \"We have here some grand prospects,\" said the Colonel, and truly enough  the view from the great, high, wide window was a very fine one.    I perceived that the grounds of Cray's Folly were extensive and  carefully cultivated. I had a glimpse of a Tudor sunken garden, but the  best view of this was from the window of Harley's room, which because  it was the end room on the north front overlooked another part of the  grounds, and offered a prospect of the east lawns and distant park land.    When presently Colonel Menendez and I accompanied my friend there I  was charmed by the picturesque scene below. Here was a real old herbal  garden, gay with flowers and intersected by tiled moss-grown paths.  There were bushes exhibiting fantastic examples of the topiary art, and  here, too, was a sun-dial. My first impression of this beautiful spot  was one of delight. Later I was to regard that enchanted demesne with  something akin to horror; but as we stood there watching a gardener  clipping the bushes I thought that although Cray's Folly might be  adjudged ugly, its grounds were delightful.    Suddenly Harley turned to our host. \"Where is the famous tower?\" he  enquired. \"It is not visible from the front of the house, nor from the  drive.\"    \"No, no,\" replied the Colonel, \"it is right out at the end of the east  wing, which is disused. I keep it locked up. There are four rooms in  the tower and a staircase, of course, but it is inconvenient. I cannot  imagine why it was built.\"    \"The architect may have had some definite object in view,\" said Harley,  \"or it may have been merely a freak of his client. Is there anything  characteristic about the topmost room, for instance?\"    Colonel Menendez shrugged his massive shoulders. \"Nothing,\" he replied.  \"It is the same as the others below, except that there is a stair  leading to a gallery on the roof. Presently I will take you up, if you  wish.\"    \"I should be interested,\" murmured Harley, and tactfully changed the  subject, which evidently was not altogether pleasing to our host. I  concluded that he had found the east wing of the house something of a  white elephant, and was accordingly sensitive upon the point.    Presently, then, he left us and I returned to my own room, but before  long I rejoined Harley. I did not knock but entered unceremoniously.    \"Halloa!\" I exclaimed. \"What have you seen?\"    He was standing staring out of the window, nor did he turn as I entered.    \"What is it?\" I said, joining him.    He glanced at me oddly.    \"An impression,\" he replied; \"but it has gone now.\"    \"I understand,\" I said, quietly.    Familiarity with crime in many guises and under many skies had developed  in Paul Harley a sort of sixth sense. It was a fugitive, fickle  thing, as are all the powers which belong to the realm of genius or  inspiration. Often enough it failed him entirely, he had assured me,  that odd, sudden chill as of an abrupt lowering of the temperature,  which, I understood, often advised him of the nearness of enmity  actively malignant.    Now, standing at the window, looking down into that old-world garden, he  was \"sensing\" the atmosphere keenly, seeking for the note of danger. It  was sheer intuition, perhaps, but whilst he could never rely upon its  answering his summons, once active it never misled him.    \"You think some real menace overhangs Colonel Menendez?\"    \"I am sure of it.\" He stared into my face. \"There is something very,  very strange about this bat wing business.\"    \"Do you still incline to the idea that he has been followed to England?\"    Paul Harley reflected for a moment, then:    \"That explanation would be almost too simple,\" he said. \"There is  something bizarre, something unclean--I had almost said unholy--at work  in this house, Knox.\"    \"He has foreign servants.\"    Harley shook his head.    \"I shall make it my business to become acquainted with all of them,\"  he replied, \"but the danger does not come from there. Let us go down to  lunch.\"          CHAPTER V    VAL BEVERLEY        The luncheon was so good as to be almost ostentatious. One could not  have lunched better at the Carlton. Yet, since this luxurious living was  evidently customary in the colonel's household, a charge of ostentation  would not have been deserved. The sinister-looking Pedro proved to be  an excellent servant; and because of the excitement of feeling myself  to stand upon the edge of unusual things, the enjoyment of a perfectly  served repast, and the sheer delight which I experienced in watching the  play of expression upon the face of Miss Beverley, I count that luncheon  at Cray's Folly a memorable hour of my life.    Frankly, Val Beverley puzzled me. It may or may not have been curious,  that amidst such singular company I selected for my especial study a  girl so freshly and typically English. I had thought at the moment of  meeting her that she was provokingly pretty; I determined, as the lunch  proceeded, that she was beautiful. Once I caught Harley smiling at me in  his quizzical fashion, and I wondered guiltily if I were displaying an  undue interest in the companion of Madame.    Many topics were discussed, I remember, and beyond doubt the colonel's  cousin-housekeeper dominated the debate. She possessed extraordinary  force of personality. Her English was not nearly so fluent as that  spoken by the colonel, but this handicap only served to emphasize the  masculine strength of her intellect. Truly she was a remarkable woman.  With her blanched hair and her young face, and those fine, velvety eyes  which possessed a quality almost hypnotic, she might have posed for the  figure of a sorceress. She had unfamiliar gestures and employed her long  white hands in a manner that was new to me and utterly strange.    I could detect no family resemblance between the cousins, and I wondered  if their kinship were very distant. One thing was evident enough: Madame  de Staemer was devoted to the Colonel. Her expression when she looked at  him changed entirely. For a woman of such intense vitality her eyes were  uncannily still; that is to say that whilst she frequently moved her  head she rarely moved her eyes. Again and again I found myself wondering  where I had seen such eyes before. I lived to identify that memory, as I  shall presently relate.    In vain I endeavoured to define the relationship between these three  people, so incongruously set beneath one roof. Of the fact that Miss  Beverly was not happy I became assured. But respecting her exact  position in the household I was reduced to surmises.    The Colonel improved on acquaintance. I decided that he belonged to an  order of Spanish grandees now almost extinct. I believed he would have  made a very staunch friend; I felt sure he would have proved a most  implacable enemy. Altogether, it was a memorable meal, and one notable  result of that brief companionship was a kind of link of understanding  between myself and Miss Beverley.    Once, when I had been studying Madame de Staemer, and again, as I removed  my glance from the dark face of Colonel Menendez, I detected the girl  watching me; and her eyes said, \"Yo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#7)"],[1,"asphemy, that the legend is a true  one, and that the man told only of what he saw; but what does it profit  us, John Carter, since even should we escape, we also would be treated  as blasphemers?  We are between the wild thoat of certainty and the mad  zitidar of fact--we can escape neither.\"    \"As Earth men say, we are between the devil and the deep sea, Tars  Tarkas,\" I replied, nor could I help but smile at our dilemma.    \"There is naught that we can do but take things as they come, and at  least have the satisfaction of knowing that whoever slays us eventually  will have far greater numbers of their own dead to count than they will  get in return.  White ape or plant man, green Barsoomian or red man,  whosoever it shall be that takes the last toll from us will know that  it is costly in lives to wipe out John Carter, Prince of the House of  Tardos Mors, and Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, at the same time.\"    I could not help but laugh at his grim humour, and he joined in with me  in one of those rare laughs of real enjoyment which was one of the  attributes of this fierce Tharkian chief which marked him from the  others of his kind.    \"But about yourself, John Carter,\" he cried at last.  \"If you have not  been here all these years where indeed have you been, and how is it  that I find you here to-day?\"    \"I have been back to Earth,\" I replied.  \"For ten long Earth years I  have been praying and hoping for the day that would carry me once more  to this grim old planet of yours, for which, with all its cruel and  terrible customs, I feel a bond of sympathy and love even greater than  for the world that gave me birth.    \"For ten years have I been enduring a living death of uncertainty and  doubt as to whether Dejah Thoris lived, and now that for the first time  in all these years my prayers have been answered and my doubt relieved  I find myself, through a cruel whim of fate, hurled into the one tiny  spot of all Barsoom from which there is apparently no escape, and if  there were, at a price which would put out for ever the last flickering  hope which I may cling to of seeing my princess again in this life--and  you have seen to-day with what pitiful futility man yearns toward a  material hereafter.    \"Only a bare half-hour before I saw you battling with the plant men I  was standing in the moonlight upon the banks of a broad river that taps  the eastern shore of Earth's most blessed land.  I have answered you,  my friend.  Do you believe?\"    \"I believe,\" replied Tars Tarkas, \"though I cannot understand.\"    As we talked I had been searching the interior of the chamber with my  eyes.  It was, perhaps, two hundred feet in length and half as broad,  with what appeared to be a doorway in the centre of the wall directly  opposite that through which we had entered.    The apartment was hewn from the material of the cliff, showing mostly  dull gold in the dim light which a single minute radium illuminator in  the centre of the roof diffused throughout its great dimensions.  Here  and there polished surfaces of ruby, emerald, and diamond patched the  golden walls and ceiling.  The floor was of another material, very  hard, and worn by much use to the smoothness of glass.  Aside from the  two doors I could discern no sign of other aperture, and as one we knew  to be locked against us I approached the other.    As I extended my hand to search for the controlling button, that cruel  and mocking laugh rang out once more, so close to me this time that I  involuntarily shrank back, tightening my grip upon the hilt of my great  sword.    And then from the far corner of the great chamber a hollow voice  chanted: \"There is no hope, there is no hope; the dead return not, the  dead return not; nor is there any resurrection.  Hope not, for there is  no hope.\"    Though our eyes instantly turned toward the spot from which the voice  seemed to emanate, there was no one in sight, and I must admit that  cold shivers played along my spine and the short hairs at the base of  my head stiffened and rose up, as do those upon a hound's neck when in  the night his eyes see those uncanny things which are hidden from the  sight of man.    Quickly I walked toward the mournful voice, but it had ceased ere I  reached the further wall, and then from the other end of the chamber  came another voice, shrill and piercing:    \"Fools!  Fools!\" it shrieked.  \"Thinkest thou to defeat the eternal  laws of life and death?  Wouldst cheat the mysterious Issus, Goddess of  Death, of her just dues?  Did not her mighty messenger, the ancient  Iss, bear you upon her leaden bosom at your own behest to the Valley  Dor?    \"Thinkest thou, O fools, that Issus wilt give up her own?  Thinkest  thou to escape from whence in all the countless ages but a single soul  has fled?    \"Go back the way thou camest, to the merciful maws of the children of  the Tree of Life or the gleaming fangs of the great white apes, for  there lies speedy surcease from suffering; but insist in your rash  purpose to thread the mazes of the Golden Cliffs of the Mountains of  Otz, past the ramparts of the impregnable fortresses of the Holy  Therns, and upon your way Death in its most frightful form will  overtake you--a death so horrible that even the Holy Therns themselves,  who conceived both Life and Death, avert their eyes from its  fiendishness and close their ears against the hideous shrieks of its  victims.    \"Go back, O fools, the way thou camest.\"    And then the awful laugh broke out from another part of the chamber.    \"Most uncanny,\" I remarked, turning to Tars Tarkas.    \"What shall we do?\" he asked.  \"We cannot fight empty air; I would  almost sooner return and face foes into whose flesh I may feel my blade  bite and know that I am selling my carcass dearly before I go down to  that eternal oblivion which is evidently the fairest and most desirable  eternity that mortal man has the right to hope for.\"    \"If, as you say, we cannot fight empty air, Tars Tarkas,\" I replied,  \"neither, on the other hand, can empty air fight us.  I, who have faced  and conquered in my time thousands of sinewy warriors and tempered  blades, shall not be turned back by wind; nor no more shall you, Thark.\"    \"But unseen voices may emanate from unseen and unseeable creatures who  wield invisible blades,\" answered the green warrior.    \"Rot, Tars Tarkas,\" I cried, \"those voices come from beings as real as  you or as I.  In their veins flows lifeblood that may be let as easily  as ours, and the fact that they remain invisible to us is the best  proof to my mind that they are mortal; nor overly courageous mortals at  that.  Think you, Tars Tarkas, that John Carter will fly at the first  shriek of a cowardly foe who dare not come out into the open and face a  good blade?\"    I had spoken in a loud voice that there might be no question that our  would-be terrorizers should hear me, for I was tiring of this  nerve-racking fiasco.  It had occurred to me, too, that the whole  business was but a plan to frighten us back into the valley of death  from which we had escaped, that we might be quickly disposed of by the  savage creatures there.    For a long period there was silence, then of a sudden a soft, stealthy  sound behind me caused me to turn suddenly to behold a great  many-legged banth creeping sinuously upon me.    The banth is a fierce beast of prey that roams the low hills  surrounding the dead seas of ancient Mars.  Like nearly all Martian  animals it is almost hairless, having only a great bristly mane about  its thick neck.    Its long, lithe body is supported by ten powerful legs, its enormous  jaws are equipped, like those of the calot, or Martian hound, with  several rows of long needle-like fangs; its mouth reaches to a point  far back of its tiny ears, while its enormous, protruding eyes of green  add the last touch of terror to its awful aspect.    As it crept toward me it lashed its powerful tail against its yellow  sides, and when it saw that it was discovered it emitted the terrifying  roar which often freezes its prey into momentary paralysis in the  instant that it makes its spring.    And so it launched its great bulk toward me, but its mighty voice had  held no paralysing terrors for me, and it met cold steel instead of the  tender flesh its cruel jaws gaped so widely to engulf.    An instant later I drew my blade from the still heart of this great  Barsoomian lion, and turning toward Tars Tarkas was surprised to see  him facing a similar monster.    No sooner had he dispatched his than I, turning, as though drawn by the  instinct of my guardian subconscious mind, beheld another of the savage  denizens of the Martian wilds leaping across the chamber toward me.    From then on for the better part of an hour one hideous creature after  another was launched upon us, springing apparently from the empty air  about us.    Tars Tarkas was satisfied; here was something tangible that he could  cut and slash with his great blade, while I, for my part, may say that  the diversion was a marked improvement over the uncanny voices from  unseen lips.    That there was nothing supernatural about our new foes was well  evidenced by their howls of rage and pain as they felt the sharp steel  at their vitals, and the very real blood which flowed from their  severed arteries as they died the real death.    I noticed during the period of this new persecution that the beasts  appeared only when our backs were turned; we never saw one really  materialize from thin air, nor did I for an instant sufficiently lose  my excellent reasoning faculties to be once deluded into the belief  that the beasts came into the room other than through some concealed  and well-contrived doorway.    Among the ornaments of Tars Tarkas' leather harness, which is the only  manner of clothing worn by Martians other than silk capes and robes of  silk and fur for protection from the cold after dark, was a small  mirror,"]]]
