But somehow, to his own surprise,  he found that he shrank from doing this. He felt that it was impossible  to ask Robert Williamson and probably have the girl's name overflowed  in a stream of petty gossip concerning her and all her antecedents and  collaterals to the third and fourth generation. If he had to ask any one  it should be Mrs. Williamson; but he meant to find out the secret for  himself if it were at all possible.    He had planned to go to the harbour the next evening. One of the  lobstermen had promised to take him out cod-fishing. But instead he  wandered southwest over the fields again.    He found the orchard easily--he had half expected NOT to find it. It  was still the same fragrant, grassy, wind-haunted spot. But it had no  occupant and the violin bow was gone from the old bench.    \"Perhaps she tiptoed back here for it by the light o' the moon,\" thought  Eric, pleasing his fancy by the vision of a lithe, girlish figure  stealing with a beating heart through mingled shadow and moonshine. \"I  wonder if she will possibly come this evening, or if I have frightened  her away for ever. I'll hide me behind this spruce copse and wait.\"    Eric waited until dark, but no music sounded through the orchard and no  one came to it. The keenness of his disappointment surprised him, nay  more, it vexed him. What nonsense to be so worked up because a little  girl he had seen for five minutes failed to appear! Where was his  common sense, his \"gumption,\" as old Robert Williamson would have said?  Naturally a man liked to look at a pretty face. But was that any reason  why he should feel as if life were flat, stale, and unprofitable simply  because he could not look at it? He called himself a fool and went home  in a petulant mood. Arriving there, he plunged fiercely into solving  algebraical equations and working out geometry exercises, determined  to put out of his head forthwith all vain imaginings of an enchanted  orchard, white in the moonshine, with lilts of elfin music echoing down  its long arcades.    The next day was Sunday and Eric went to church twice. The Williamson  pew was one of the side ones at the top of the church and its occupants  practically faced the congregation. Eric looked at every girl and woman  in the audience, but he saw nothing of the face which, setting will  power and common sense flatly at defiance, haunted his memory like a  star.    Thomas Gordon was there, sitting alone in his long, empty pew near the  top of the building; and Neil Gordon sang in the choir which occupied  the front pew of the gallery. He had a powerful and melodious, though  untrained voice, which dominated the singing and took the colour out  of the weaker, more commonplace tones of the other singers. He was  well-dressed in a suit of dark blue serge, with a white collar and  tie. But Eric idly thought it did not become him so well as the working  clothes in which he had first seen him. He was too obviously dressed up,  and he looked coarser and more out of harmony with his surroundings.    For two days Eric refused to let himself think of the orchard. Monday  evening he went cod-fishing, and Tuesday evening he went up to play  checkers with Alexander Tracy. Alexander won all the games so easily  that he never had any respect for Eric Marshall again.    \"Played like a feller whose thoughts were wool gathering,\" he complained  to his wife. \"He'll never make a checker player--never in this world.\"        CHAPTER VI. THE STORY OF KILMENY    Wednesday evening Eric went to the orchard again; and again he was  disappointed. He went home, determined to solve the mystery by open  inquiry. Fortune favoured him, for he found Mrs. Williamson alone,  sitting by the west window of her kitchen and knitting at a long gray  sock. She hummed softly to herself as she knitted, and Timothy slept  blackly at her feet. She looked at Eric with quiet affection in her  large, candid eyes. She had liked Mr. West. But Eric had found his way  into the inner chamber of her heart, by reason that his eyes were so  like those of the little son she had buried in the Lindsay churchyard  many years before.    \"Mrs. Williamson,\" said Eric, with an affectation of carelessness, \"I  chanced on an old deserted orchard back behind the woods over there last  week, a charming bit of wilderness. Do you know whose it is?\"    \"I suppose it must be the old Connors orchard,\" answered Mrs. Williamson  after a moment's reflection. \"I had forgotten all about it. It must be  all of thirty years since Mr. and Mrs. Connors moved away. Their house  and barns were burned down and they sold the land to Thomas Gordon and  went to live in town. They're both dead now. Mr. Connors used to be  very proud of his orchard. There weren't many orchards in Lindsay then,  though almost everybody has one now.\"    \"There was a young girl in it, playing on a violin,\" said Eric, annoyed  to find that it cost him an effort to speak of her, and that the blood  mounted to his face as he did so. \"She ran away in great alarm as  soon as she saw me, although I do not think I did or said anything to  frighten or vex her. I have no idea who she was. Do you know?\"    Mrs. Williamson did not make an immediate reply. She laid down her  knitting and gazed out of the window as if pondering seriously some  question in her own mind. Finally she said, with an intonation of keen  interest in her voice,    \"I suppose it must have been Kilmeny Gordon, Master.\"    \"Kilmeny Gordon? Do you mean the niece of Thomas Gordon of whom your  husband spoke?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I can hardly believe that the girl I saw can be a member of Thomas  Gordon's family.\"    \"Well, if it wasn't Kilmeny Gordon I don't know who it could have been.  There is no other house near that orchard and I've heard she plays the  violin. If it was Kilmeny you've seen what very few people in Lindsay  have ever seen, Master. And those few have never seen her close by. I  have never laid eyes on her myself. It's no wonder she ran away, poor  girl. She isn't used to seeing strangers.\"    \"I'm rather glad if that was the sole reason of her flight,\" said  Eric. \"I admit I didn't like to see any girl so frightened of me as she  appeared to be. She was as white as paper, and so terrified that she  never uttered a word, but fled like a deer to cover.\"    \"Well, she couldn't have spoken a word in any case,\" said Mrs.  Williamson quietly. \"Kilmeny Gordon is dumb.\"    Eric sat in dismayed silence for a moment. That beautiful creature  afflicted in such a fashion--why, it was horrible! Mingled with his  dismay was a strange pang of personal regret and disappointment.    \"It couldn't have been Kilmeny Gordon, then,\" he protested at last,  remembering. \"The girl I saw played on the violin exquisitely. I never  heard anything like it. It is impossible that a deaf mute could play  like that.\"    \"Oh, she isn't deaf, Master,\" responded Mrs. Williamson, looking at Eric  keenly through her spectacles. She picked up her knitting and fell to  work again. \"That is the strange part of it, if anything about her  can be stranger than another. She can hear as well as anybody and  understands everything that is said to her. But she can't speak a word  and never could, at least, so they say. The truth is, nobody knows much  about her. Janet and Thomas never speak of her, and Neil won't either.  He has been well questioned, too, you can depend on that; but he won't  ever say a word about Kilmeny and he gets mad if folks persist.\"    \"Why isn't she to be spoken of?\" queried Eric impatiently. \"What is the  mystery about her?\"    \"It's a sad story, Master. I suppose the Gordons look on her existence  as a sort of disgrace. For my own part, I think it's terrible, the way  she's been brought up. But the Gordons are very strange people, Mr.  Marshall. I kind of reproved father for saying so, you remember, but it  is true. They have very strange ways. And you've really seen Kilmeny?  What does she look like? I've heard that she was handsome. Is it true?\"    \"I thought her very beautiful,\" said Eric rather curtly. \"But HOW has  she been brought up, Mrs. Williamson? And why?\"    \"Well, I might as well tell you the whole story, Master. Kilmeny is the  niece of Thomas and Janet Gordon. Her mother was Margaret Gordon, their  younger sister. Old James Gordon came out from Scotland. Janet and  Thomas were born in the Old Country and were small children when they  came here. They were never very sociable folks, but still they used to  visit out some then, and people used to go there. They were kind and  honest people, even if they were a little peculiar.    \"Mrs. Gordon died a few years after they came out, and four years later  James Gordon went home to Scotland and brought a new wife back with him.  She was a great deal younger than he was and a very pretty woman, as my  mother often told me. She was friendly and gay and liked social life.  The Gordon place was a very different sort of place after she came  there, and even Janet and Thomas got thawed out and softened down a  good bit. They were real fond of their stepmother, I've heard. Then, six  years after she was married, the second Mrs. Gordon died too. She died  when Margaret was born. They say James Gordon almost broke his heart  over it.    \"Janet brought Margaret up. She and Thomas just worshipped the child and  so did their father. I knew Margaret Gordon well once. We were just  the same age and we set together in school. We were always good friends  until she turned against all the world.    \"She was a strange girl in some ways even then, but I always liked her,  though a great many people didn't. She had some bitter enemies, but she  had some devoted friends too. That was her way. She made folks either  hate or love her. Those who did love her would have gone through fire  and water for her.    \"When she grew "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#7)"],[1,"    540--A Daughter of Darkness                   By Ida Reade Allen    541--Her Evil Genius                        By Adelaide Stirling    543--The Veiled Bride                       By Laura Jean Libbey    544--In Love's Name                       By Emma Garrison Jones    545--Well Worth Winning                  By St. George Rathborne    546--The Career of Mrs. Osborne                By Helen Milecete    549--Tempted by Love                  By Effie Adelaide Rowlands    550--Saved from Herself                     By Adelaide Stirling    551--Pity--Not Love                         By Laura Jean Libbey    552--At the Court of the Maharaja                 By Louis Tracy          _The Best of Everything!_      Our experience with the American reading public has taught us that  it expects better reading than readers of any other nationality.

Most everybody thinks that the public library is a mighty fine  institution--teaches people to read, and all that. Well, so it does,  but does any one ever think of the great risk that a person, who takes  a book out of a public library, runs of catching some contagious  disease?    Every time a bacteriological examination is made of the public-library  book, germs of every known disease are found among its pages. Probably,  from your own experience, you know that lots of people never think of  taking a book from the public library, until some one in their family  is sick and wants something to read.    As records prove that ninety per cent of the demand for books at the  public libraries is for works of fiction, it strikes us that the  reading public would do better to patronize the S. & S. novel list  which contains hundreds of books to be found in the public libraries,  and many hundreds of others just as good and interesting.    The price of the S. & S. novels is a low one indeed to pay for  protection from disease-laden literature. Why run the risk, then, when  you can get a fresh, clean book for little money and thus insure your  health?      STREET & SMITH, _Publishers_  NEW YORK          The S. & S.

STREET & SMITH, _Publishers_  NEW YORK          ONLY A GIRL'S LOVE.          CHAPTER I.      It is a warm evening in early Summer; the sun is setting behind a long  range of fir and yew-clad hills, at the feet of which twists in and  out, as it follows their curves, a placid, peaceful river. Opposite  these hills, and running beside the river, are long-stretching meadows,  brilliantly green with fresh-springing grass, and gorgeously yellow  with newly-opened buttercups. Above, the sunset sky gleams and glows  with fiery red and rich deep chromes. And London is almost within sight.    It is a beautiful scene, such as one sees only in this England of  ours--a scene that defies poet and painter. At this very moment it  is defying one of the latter genus; for in a room of a low-browed,  thatched-roofed cottage which stood on the margin of the meadow, James  Etheridge sat beside his easel, his eyes fixed on the picture framed in  the open window, his brush and mahl-stick drooping in his idle hand.    Unconsciously he, the painter, made a picture worthy of study. Tall,  thin, delicately made, with pale face crowned and set in softly-flowing  white hair, with gentle, dreamy eyes ever seeking the infinite and  unknown, he looked like one of those figures which the old Florentine  artists used to love to put upon their canvases, and which when one  sees even now makes one strangely sad and thoughtful.    The room was a fitting frame for the human subject; it was a true  painter's studio--untidy, disordered, and picturesque. Finished and  unfinished pictures hung or leant against the walls, suits of armor,  antique weapons, strange costumes littered the floor or hung limply  over mediaeval chairs; books, some in bindings which would have made the  mouth of a connoisseur water, lay open upon the table or were piled in  a distant corner. And over all silence--unbroken save by the sound of  the water rushing over the weir, or the birds which flitted by the open  window--reigned supreme.    The old man sat for some time listening to Nature's music, and lost in  dreamy admiration of her loveliness, until the striking of the church  clock floated from the village behind the house; then, with a start,  he rose, took up his brushes, and turned again to the easel. An hour  passed, and still he worked, the picture growing beneath the thin,  skillful hand; the birds sank into silence, the red faded slowly from  the sky, and night unfolded its dark mantle ready to let it fall upon  the workaday world.    Silence so profound took to itself the likeness of loneliness; perhaps  the old man felt it so, for as he glanced at the waning light and lay  his brush down, he put his hand to his brow and sighed. Then he turned  the picture on the easel, made his way with some little difficulty,  owing to the litter, across the room, found and lit an old briar-wood  pipe, and dropping into the chair again, fixed his eyes upon the scene,  and fell into the dreamy state which was habitual with him.    So lost in purposeless memory was he, that the opening of the door  failed to rouse him.    It was opened very gently and slowly, and as slowly and noiselessly a  young girl, after pausing a moment at the threshold, stepped into the  room, and stood looking round her and at the motionless figure in the  chair by the window.    She stood for full a minute, her hand still holding the handle of the  door, as if she were not certain of her welcome--as if the room were  strange to her, then, with a little hurried pressure of her hand to her  bosom, she moved toward the window.    As she did so her foot struck against a piece of armor, and the noise  aroused the old man and caused him to look round.    With a start he gazed at the girl as if impressed with the idea that  she must be something unsubstantial and visionary--some embodiment of  his evening dreams, and so he sat looking at her, his artist eye taking  in the lithe, graceful figure, the beautiful face, with its dark eyes  and long, sweeping lashes, its clearly penciled brows, and soft, mobile  lips, in rapt absorption.    It is possible that if she had turned and left him, never to have  crossed into his life again, he would have sunk back into dreamland,  and to the end of his days have regarded her as unreal and visionary;  but, with a subtle, graceful movement, the girl threaded the maze of  litter and disorder and stood beside him.    He, still looking up, saw that the beautiful eyes were dim, that the  exquisitely curved lips were quivering with some intense emotion, and  suddenly there broke upon the silence a low, sweet voice:    \"Are you James Etheridge?\"    The artist started. It was not the words, but the tone--the voice that  startled him, and for a brief second he was still dumb, then he rose,  and looking at her with faint, trembling questioning, he answered:    \"Yes, that is my name. I am James Etheridge.\"    Her lips quivered again, but still, quietly and simply, she said:    \"You do not know me? I am Stella--your niece, Stella.\"    The old man threw up his head and stared at her, and she saw that he  trembled.    \"Stella--my niece--Harold's child!\"    \"Yes,\" she said, in a low voice, \"I am Stella.\"    \"But, merciful Heaven!\" he exclaimed, with agitation, \"how did  you come here? Why--I thought you were at the school there in  Florence--why--have you come here alone?\"    Her eyes wandered from his face to the exquisite scene beyond, and at  that moment her look was strangely like his own.    \"Yes, I came alone, uncle,\" she said.    \"Merciful Heaven!\" he murmured again, sinking into his chair. \"But  why--why?\"    The question is not unkindly put, full, rather, of a troubled  perplexity and bewilderment.
