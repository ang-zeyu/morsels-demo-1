The highest reading outdoors was 0.028 R/h, and the  highest reading indoors was 0.004 R/h (11; 19).    Monitoring was also conducted in offsite areas other than those to the  north and northeast of ground zero.  Monitors found no radiation  readings above background levels (11).    Significant fallout from the TRINITY cloud did not reach the ground  within about 20 kilometers northeast of ground zero.  From this point,  the fallout pattern extended out 160 kilometers and was 48 kilometers  wide.  Gamma intensities up to 15 R/h were measured in this region  several hours after the detonation.  One month later, intensities had  declined to 0.032 R/h or less (11).        CHAPTER 4    DOSIMETRY ANALYSIS OF PARTICIPANTS IN PROJECT TRINITY      This chapter summarizes the radiation doses received by participants  in various activities during Project TRINITY.  The sources of this  dosimetry information are the safety and monitoring report for  personnel at TRINITY, which includes a compilation of film badge  readings for all participants up to 1 January 1946, and film badge  data from the records of the Reynolds Electrical and Engineering  Company, which contain readings through 1946 (1; 16).  These sources  list individual participants with their cumulative gamma radiation  exposures.      4.1 FILM BADGE RECORDS    During TRINITY, the film badge was the primary device used to measure  the radiation dose received by individual participants.  The site  monitoring plan indicates that film badges were to be issued to  participants.  The film badge was normally worn at chest level on the  outside of clothing and was designed to measure the wearer's exposure  to gamma radiation from external sources.  These film badges were  insensitive to neutron radiation and did not measure the amount of  radioactive material that might have been inhaled or ingested (1).    Personnel from the Medical Group had responsibility for issuing,  receiving, processing, and interpreting film badges for Project  TRINITY.  The Site Monitoring Group compiled the film badge records  for both onsite and offsite personnel.  Radiological safety personnel  and military police recorded the names and identification numbers of  individuals as they entered the test area.  This information was  recorded in an entry logbook and on a personal exposure data card.  Upon leaving the test area, individuals returned their film badges to  the check station.  When the film badges were processed and  interpreted, the reading was entered on the individuals exposure data  card.  In this manner, the number of times an individual entered the  test area and his cumulative exposure history were recorded and  maintained (1).      4.2 GAMMA RADIATION EXPOSURE    The safety and monitoring report lists film badge readings for about  700 individuals who participated in Project TRINITY from 16 July 1945  to 1 January 1946 (1).  This list includes both military and  nonmilitary personnel who were involved with the TRINITY operation and  postshot activities.  However, records are available for only 44 of  the 144 to 160 members of the evacuation detachment (1).  In addition,  some of these film badge listings may be for personnel who were only  peripherally involved with TRINITY activities, such as family members  and official guests who visited the site.    According to the safety and monitoring report, by 1 January 1946, 23  individuals had received cumulative gamma exposures greater than 2 but  less than 4 roentgens.  An additional 22 individuals received gamma  exposures between 4 and 15 roentgens.  Personnel who received gamma  exposures exceeding 2 roentgens represent less than six percent of the  Project TRINITY participants with recorded exposures.  As described  below, these exposures generally resulted when personnel approached  ground zero several times (1).    Information is available regarding the activities of some of these  personnel.  One of the drivers of the earth-sampling group's  lead-lined tank, an Army sergeant who traveled three times to ground  zero, received an exposure of 15 roentgens.  A second tank driver,  also an Army sergeant, received an exposure of 3.3 roentgens.  Three  members of the earth-sampling group, all of whom traveled in the tank  to ground zero, received exposures of 10, 7.5, and 5 roentgens.  An  Army photographer who entered the test area six times between 23 July  and 20 October received 12.2 roentgens (1).    Four individuals involved with excavating the buried supports of the  TRINITY tower from 8 October to 10 October 1945 received gamma  exposures ranging from 3.4 to 4.7 roentgens.  Film badge readings for  this three-day period indicate that the two individuals who operated  mechanical shovels received 3.4 and 4.3 roentgens, while the two who  supervised and monitored the excavation received exposures of 4.2 and  4.7 roentgens.  The individual receiving 4.7 roentgens during the  excavation operation had received 1.3 roentgens from a previous  exposure, making his total exposure 6 roentgens (1).    An Army captain who accompanied all test and observer parties into the  ground zero area between 1 September and 11 October 1945 received a  total gamma exposure of 2.6 roentgens (1).  The activities and times  of exposure are not known for other personnel with exposures over 2  roentgens.    According to the dosimetry records for 1946, about 115 people visited  the test site that year.  No one ventured inside the fence surrounding  ground zero, and no one received an exposure greater than 1 roentgen  (1; 16).

The servant's gateway, still hung with flowers and wreaths in honor of  Orion's recent return, was wide open for the coming and going of the  accountants and scribes, or of such citizens as came very willingly to  pay an evening call on their friends in the governor's household; for  there were always some officials near the Mukaukas' person who knew more  than other folks of the latest events in Church and State.    Ere long a considerable number of men had assembled to sit under the  deep wooden porch of the head-steward's dwelling, all taking eager part  in the conversation, which they would have found very enjoyable even  without the beer which their host offered them in honor of the great  event of his young lord's return; for what was ever dearer to Egyptians  than a brisk exchange of talk, at the same time heaping ridicule or  scorn on their unapproachable superiors in rank, and on all they deem  enemies to their creed or their country.    Many a trenchant word and many a witty jest must have been uttered this  evening, for hearty laughter and loud applause were incessant in the  head steward's porch; the captain of the guard at the gate cast envious  and impatient glances at the merry band, which he would gladly have  joined; but he could not yet leave his post. The messengers' horses were  standing saddled while their riders awaited their orders, there were  supplicants and traders to be admitted or turned away, and there were  still a number of persons lingering in the large vestibule of the  governor's palace and craving to speak with him, for it was well known  in Memphis that during the hot season the ailing Mukaukas granted  audience only in the evening.    The Egyptians had not yet acquired full confidence in the Arab  government, and every one tried to avoid being handed over to its  representative; for none of its officials could be so wise or so just  as their old Mukaukas. How the suffering man found strength and time to  keep an eye on everything, it was hard to imagine; but the fact remained  that he himself looked into every decision. At the same time no one  could be sure of his affairs being settled out of hand unless he could  get at the governor himself.    Business hours were now over; the anxiety caused both by the delay in  the rising of the Nile and by the advent of the comet had filled the  waiting-rooms with more petitioners than usual. Deputations from town  and village magistrates had been admitted in parties; supplicants on  private business had gone in one by one; and most of them had come forth  content, or at any rate well advised. Only one man still lingered,--a  countryman whose case had long been awaiting settlement--in the hope  that a gift to the great man's doorkeeper, of a few drachmae out of his  poverty might at length secure him the fruit of his long patience--when  the chamberlain, bidding him return on the morrow, officiously flung  open the high doors that led to the Mukaukas' apartments, to admit the  Arab merchant, in consideration of Haschim's gold piece which had come  to him through his cousin the dragoman. Haschim, however, had observed  the countryman, and insisted on his being shown in first. This was done,  and a few minutes later the peasant came out satisfied, and gratefully  kissed the Arab's hand.    Then the chamberlain led the old merchant, and the men who followed him  with a heavy bale, into a magnificent anteroom to wait; and his patience  was put to a severe test before his name was called and he could show  the governor his merchandise.    The Mukaukas, in fact, after signifying by a speechless nod that he  would presently receive the merchant--who came well recommended--had  retired to recreate himself, and was now engaged in a game of draughts,  heedless of those whom he kept waiting. He reclined on a divan covered  with a sleek lioness' skin, while his young antagonist sat opposite on  a low stool, The doors of the room, facing the Nile, where he received  petitioners were left half open to admit the fresher but still warm  evening-air. The green velarium or awning, which during the day had  screened off the sun's rays where the middle of the ceiling was open to  the sky, was now rolled back, and the moon and stars looked down into  the room. It was well adapted to its purpose as a refuge from the  heat of the summer day, for the walls were lined with cool, colored  earthenware tiles, the floor was a brightly-tinted mosaic of patterns  on a ground of gold glass, and in the circular central ornament of this  artistic pavement stood the real source of freshness: a basin, two  man's length across, of brown porphyry flecked with white, from which  a fountain leaped, filling the surrounding air with misty spray. A few  stools, couches and small tables, all of cool-looking metal, formed the  sole furniture of this lofty apartment which was brilliantly lighted by  numerous lamps.    A light air blew in through the open roof and doors, made the lamps  flicker, and played with Paula's brown hair as she sat absorbed, as  it seemed, in the game. Orion, who stood behind her, had several times  endeavored to attract her attention, but in vain. He now eagerly offered  his services to fetch her a handkerchief to preserve her from a chill;  this, however, she shortly and decidedly declined, though the breeze  came up damp from the river and she had more than once drawn her peplos  more closely across her bosom.    The young man set his teeth at this fresh repulse. He did not know that  his mother had told Paula what he had yesterday agreed to, and could  not account for the girl's altered behavior. All day she had treated him  with icy coldness, had scarcely answered his questions with a distant  \"Yes,\" or \"No;\" and to him, the spoilt favorite of women, this conduct  had become more and more intolerable. Yes, his mother had judged her  rightly: she allowed herself to be swayed in a most extraordinary  manner by her moods; and now even he was to feel the insolence of  her haughtiness, of which he had as yet seen nothing. This repellent  coldness bordered on rudeness and he had no mind to submit to it for  long. It was with deep vexation that he watched every turn of her hand,  every movement of her body, and the varying expression of her face; and  the more the image of this proud maiden sank into his heart the more  lovely and perfect he thought her, and the greater grew his desire to  see her smile once more, to see her again as sweetly womanly as she  had been but yesterday. Now she was like nothing so much as a splendid  marble statue, though he knew indeed that it had a soul--and what a  glorious task it would be to free this fair being from herself, as  it were, from the foolish tempers that enslaved her, to show her--by  severity if need should be--what best beseems a woman, a maiden.    He became more and more exclusively absorbed in watching the young girl,  as his mother--who was sitting with Dame Susannah on a couch at some  little distance from the players--observed with growing annoyance, and  she tried to divert his attention by questions and small errands, so as  to give his evident excitement a fresh direction.    Who could have thought, yesterday morning, that her darling would so  soon cause her fresh vexation and anxiety.    He had come home just such a man as she and his father could have  wished: independent and experienced in the ways of the great world. In  the Capital he had, no doubt, enjoyed all that seems pleasant in the  eyes of a wealthy youth, but in spite of that he had remained fresh  and open-hearted even to the smallest things; and this was what most  rejoiced his father. In him there was no trace of the satiety, the  blunted faculty for enjoyment, which fell like a blight on so many men  of his age and rank. He could still play as merrily with little Mary,  still take as much pleasure in a rare flower or a fine horse, as before  his departure. At the same time he had gained keen insight into the  political situation of the time, into the state of the empire and the  court, into administration, and the innovations in church matters; it  was a joy to his father to hear him discourse; and he assured his wife  that he had learnt a great deal from the boy, that Orion was on the high  road to be a great statesman and was already quite capable of taking his  father's place.    When Neforis confessed how large a sum in debts Orion had left in  Constantinople the old man put his hand in his purse with a sort of  pride, delighted to find that his sole remaining heir knew how to  spend the immense wealth which to him was now a burden rather than a  pleasure--to make good use of it, as he himself had done in his day, and  display a magnificence of which the lustre was reflected on him and on  his name.    \"With him, at any rate,\" said the old man, \"one gets something for the  money. His horses cost a great deal but he knows how to win with them;  his entertainments swallow up a pretty sum, but they gain him respect  wherever he goes. He brought me a letter from the Senator Justinus, and  the worthy man tells me what a leading part he plays among the gilded  youth of the Capital. All this is not to be had for nothing, and it will  be cheap in the end. What need we care about a hundred talents more or  less! And there is something magnanimous in the lad that has given him  the spirit to feel that.\"    And it was not a hale old grey-beard who spoke thus, but a broken man,  whose only joy it was to lavish on his son the riches which he had long  been incapable of enjoying. The high-spirited and gifted youth, scarcely  more than a boy in years, whom he had sent to the Capital with no small  misgivings, must have led a far less lawless life than might have been  "]]]
