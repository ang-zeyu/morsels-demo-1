Monarchs are but the slaves of their condition;  They dare not hear the dictates of their hearts;  My wish was ever to remain unmarried,  And I had placed my greatest pride in this,  That men hereafter on my tomb might read,  \"Here rests the virgin queen.\" But my good subjects  Are not content that this should be: they think,  E'en now they often think upon the time  When I shall be no more. 'Tis not enough  That blessings now are showered upon this land;  They ask a sacrifice for future welfare,  And I must offer up my liberty,  My virgin liberty, my greatest good,  To satisfy my people. Thus they'd force  A lord and master on me. 'Tis by this  I see that I am nothing but a woman  In their regard; and yet methought that I  Had governed like a man, and like a king.  Well wot I that it is not serving God  To quit the laws of nature; and that those  Who here have ruled before me merit praise,  That they have oped the cloister gates, and given  Thousands of victims of ill-taught devotion  Back to the duties of humanity.  But yet a queen who hath not spent her days  In fruitless, idle contemplation; who,  Without murmur, indefatigably  Performs the hardest of all duties; she  Should be exempted from that natural law  Which doth ordain one half of human kind  Shall ever be subservient to the other.    AUBESPINE.  Great queen, you have upon your throne done honor  To every virtue; nothing now remains  But to the sex, whose greatest boast you are  To be the leading star, and give the great  Example of its most consistent duties.  'Tis true, the man exists not who deserves  That you to him should sacrifice your freedom;  Yet if a hero's soul, descent, and rank,  And manly beauty can make mortal man  Deserving of this honor----    ELIZABETH.                Without doubt,  My lord ambassador, a marriage union  With France's royal son would do me honor;  Yes, I acknowledge it without disguise,  If it must be, if I cannot prevent it,  If I must yield unto my people's prayers,  And much I fear they will o'erpower me,  I do not know in Europe any prince  To whom with less reluctance I would yield  My greatest treasure, my dear liberty.  Let this confession satisfy your master.    BELLIEVRE.  It gives the fairest hope, and yet it gives  Nothing but hope; my master wishes more.    ELIZABETH.  What wishes he?     [She takes a ring from her finger, and thoughtfully examines it.           In this a queen has not  One privilege above all other women.  This common token marks one common duty,  One common servitude; the ring denotes  Marriage, and 'tis of rings a chain is formed.  Convey this present to his highness; 'tis  As yet no chain, it binds me not as yet,  But out of it may grow a link to bind me.    BELLIEVRE (kneeling).  This present, in his name, upon my knees,  I do receive, great queen, and press the kiss  Of homage on the hand of her who is  Henceforth my princess.    ELIZABETH (to the EARL OF LEICESTER, whom she, during the last speeches,   had continually regarded).               By your leave, my lord.       [She takes the blue ribbon from his neck [1], and invests Bellievre     with it.    Invest his highness with this ornament,  As I invest you with it, and receive you  Into the duties of my gallant order.  And, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense.\" Thus perish  All jealousy between our several realms,  And let the bond of confidence unite  Henceforth, the crowns of Britain and of France.    BELLIEVRE.  Most sovereign queen, this is a day of joy;  Oh that it could be so for all, and no  Afflicted heart within this island mourn.  See! mercy beams upon thy radiant brow;  Let the reflection of its cheering light  Fall on a wretched princess, who concerns  Britain and France alike.    ELIZABETH.                No further, count!  Let us not mix two inconsistent things;  If France be truly anxious for my hand,  It must partake my interests, and renounce  Alliance with my foes.    AUBESPINE.              In thine own eyes  Would she not seem to act unworthily,  If in this joyous treaty she forgot  This hapless queen, the widow of her king;  In whose behalf her honor and her faith  Are bound to plead for grace.    ELIZABETH.                  Thus urged, I know  To rate this intercession at its worth;  France has discharged her duties as a friend,  I will fulfil my own as England's queen.       [She bows to the French ambassadors, who, with the other     gentlemen, retire respectfully.         [1] Till the time of Charles the First, the Knights of the Garter     wore the blue ribbon with the George about their necks, as they     still do the collars, on great days.--TRANSLATOR.        SCENE III.       Enter BURLEIGH, LEICESTER, and TALBOT.     The QUEEN takes her seat.    BURLEIGH.  Illustrious sovereign, thou crown'st to-day  The fervent wishes of thy people; now  We can rejoice in the propitious days  Which thou bestowest upon us; and we look  No more with fear and trembling towards the time  Which, charged with storms, futurity presented.  Now, but one only care disturbs this land;  It is a sacrifice which every voice  Demands; Oh! grant but this and England's peace  Will be established now and evermore.    ELIZABETH.  What wish they still, my lord? Speak.    BURLEIGH.                      They demand  The Stuart's head. If to thy people thou  Wouldst now secure the precious boon of freedom,  And the fair light of truth so dearly won,  Then she must die; if we are not to live  In endless terror for thy precious life  The enemy must fall; for well thou know'st  That all thy Britons are not true alike;  Romish idolatry has still its friends  In secret, in this island, who foment  The hatred of our enemies. Their hearts  All turn toward this Stuart; they are leagued  With the two plotting brothers of Lorrain,  The foes inveterate of thy house and name.  'Gainst thee this raging faction hath declared  A war of desolation, which they wage  With the deceitful instruments of hell.  At Rheims, the cardinal archbishop's see,  There is the arsenal from which they dart  These lightnings; there the school of regicide;  Thence, in a thousand shapes disguised, are sent  Their secret missionaries to this isle;  Their bold and daring zealots; for from thence  Have we not seen the third assassin come?  And inexhausted is the direful breed  Of secret enemies in this abyss.  While in her castle sits at Fotheringay,  The Ate [1] of this everlasting war,  Who, with the torch of love, spreads flames around;  For her who sheds delusive hopes on all,  Youth dedicates itself to certain death;  To set her free is the pretence--the aim  Is to establish her upon the throne.  For this accursed House of Guise denies  Thy sacred right; and in their mouths thou art  A robber of the throne, whom chance has crowned.  By them this thoughtless woman was deluded,  Proudly to style herself the Queen of England;  No peace can be with her, and with her house;  [Their hatred is too bloody, and their crimes  Too great;] thou must resolve to strike, or suffer--  Her life is death to thee, her death thy life.    ELIZABETH.  My lord, you bear a melancholy office;  I know the purity which guides your zeal,  The solid wisdom which informs your speech;  And yet I hate this wisdom, when it calls  For blood, I hate it in my inmost soul.  Think of a milder counsel--Good my Lord  Of Shrewsbury, we crave your judgment here.    TALBOT.  [Desire you but to know, most gracious queen,  What is for your advantage, I can add  Nothing to what my lord high-treasurer  Has urged; then, for your welfare, let the sentence  Be now confirmed--this much is proved already:  There is no surer method to avert  The danger from your head and from the state.  Should you in this reject our true advice,  You can dismiss your council. We are placed  Here as your counsellors, but to consult  The welfare of this land, and with our knowledge  And our experience we are bound to serve you!  But in what's good and just, most gracious queen,  You have no need of counsellors, your conscience  Knows it full well, and it is written there.  Nay, it were overstepping our commission  If we attempted to instruct you in it.    ELIZABETH.  Yet speak, my worthy Lord of Shrewsbury,  'Tis not our understanding fails alone,  Our heart too feels it wants some sage advice.]    TALBOT.  Well did you praise the upright zeal which fires  Lord Burleigh's loyal breast; my bosom, too,  Although my tongue be not so eloquent,  Beats with no weaker, no less faithful pulse.  Long may you live, my queen, to be the joy  Of your delighted people, to prolong  Peace and its envied blessings in this realm.  Ne'er hath this isle beheld such happy days  Since it was governed by its native kings.  Oh, let it never buy its happiness  With its good name; at least, may Talbot's eyes  Be closed in death e'er this shall come to pass.    ELIZABETH.  Forbid it, heaven, that our good name be stained!    TALBOT.  Then must you find some other way than this  To save thy kingdom, for the sentence passed  Of death against the Stuart is unjust.  You cannot upon her pronounce a sentence  Who is not subject to you.    ELIZABETH.                Then, it seems,  My council and my parliament have erred;  Each bench of justice in the land is wrong,  Which did with one accord admit this right.    TALBOT (after a pause).  The proof of justice lies not in the voice  Of numbers; England's not the world, nor is  Thy parliament the focus, which collects  The vast opinion of the human race.  This present England is no more the future  Than 'tis the past; as inclination changes,  Thus ever ebbs and flows the unstable tide  Of public judgment. Say not, then, that thou  Must act as stern necessity compels,  That thou must yield to the importunate  Petitions of thy people; every hour  Thou canst experience that thy will is free.  Make trial, and declare thou "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798"],[0,"Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller (#7)"],[1,"ience.  A conception formed from notions which transcend the possibility of  experience is an idea or a conception of reason.\"    Intuition (Anschauung) as used by Kant, is external or internal.  External, sensuous intuition is identical with perception; internal  intuition gives birth to ideas.    Matter and Form. \"These two conceptions are at the foundation of all  other reflection, being inseparably connected with every mode of  exercising the understanding. By the former is implied that which can be  determined in general; the second implies its determination, both in a  transcendental sense, abstraction being made of any difference in that  which is given, and of the mode in which it is determined. That which in  the phenomenon corresponds to the sensation, I term its matter; but that  which effects that the content of the phenomenon can be arranged under  certain relations, I call its form.\"--Kant, \"Critique,\" op. cit.    Objective. What is inherent or relative to an object, or not Myself,  except in the case when I reflect on myself, in which case my states of  mind are objective to my thoughts. In a popular sense objective means  external, as contrasted with the subjective or internal.    Perception, if it relates only to the subject as a modification of its  state, is a sensation. An objective perception is a cognition  (Erkenntniss).    Phenomena (Erscheinnngen). The undetermined object of an empirical  intuition is called phenomenon.    Reason (pure; Germanice, \"Vernunft\"). The source of ideas of moral  feelings and of conceptions free from all elements taken up from  experience.    Representation (Vorstellung). All the products of the mind are styled  representations (except emotions and mere sensations) and the term is  applied to the whole genus.    Representation with consciousness is perceptio.    Sensation. The capacity of receiving representations through the mode in  which we are affected by objects is called sensibility. By means of  sensibility objects are given to us, and it alone furnishes with  intentions meaning sensuous intuitions. By the understanding they are  thought, and from it arise conceptions.    Subjective. What has its source in and relation to the personality, to  Myself, I, or the Ego; opposed to the objective, or what is inherent in  and relative to the object. Not myself, except in the case when my  states of mind are the object of my own reflection.    Supersensuous. Contrasted with and opposed to the sensuous. What is  exclusively related to sense or imparted through the sensuous ideas is  supersensuous. See Transcendental.    Transcendental. What exceeds the limits of sense and empirical  observation. \"I apply the term transcendental to all knowledge which is  not so much occupied with objects as with the mode of our cognition of  these objects, so far as this mode of cognition is possible a priori.\"  Kant's \"Critique,\" op. cit. p. 16.    Understanding (Verstand). The thought of faculty, the source of  conceptions and notions (Begriffe) of the laws of logic, the categories,  and judgment.              LETTERS ON THE AESTHETICAL EDUCATION OF MAN.          LETTER I.      By your permission I lay before you, in a series of letters, the results  of my researches upon beauty and art. I am keenly sensible of the  importance as well as of the charm and dignity of this undertaking. I  shall treat a subject which is closely connected with the better portion  of our happiness and not far removed from the moral nobility of human  nature. I shall plead this cause of the beautiful before a heart by  which her whole power is felt and exercised, and which will take upon  itself the most difficult part of my task in an investigation where one  is compelled to appeal as frequently to feelings as to principles.    That which I would beg of you as a favor, you generously impose upon me  as a duty; and, when I solely consult my inclination, you impute to me a  service. The liberty of action you prescribe is rather a necessity for  me than a constraint. Little exercised in formal rules, I shall scarcely  incur the risk of sinning against good taste by any undue use of them; my  ideas, drawn rather from within than from reading or from an intimate  experience with the world, will not disown their origin; they would  rather incur any reproach than that of a sectarian bias, and would prefer  to succumb by their innate feebleness than sustain themselves by borrowed  authority and foreign support.    In truth, I will not keep back from you that the assertions which follow  rest chiefly upon Kantian principles; but if in the course of these  researches you should be reminded of any special school of philosophy,  ascribe it to my incapacity, not to those principles. No; your liberty  of mind shall be sacred to me; and the facts upon which I build will be  furnished by your own sentiments; your own unfettered thought will  dictate the laws according to which we have to proceed.    With regard to the ideas which predominate in the practical part of  Kant's system, philosophers only disagree, whilst mankind, I am confident  of proving, have never done so. If stripped of their technical shape,  they will appear as the verdict of reason pronounced from time immemorial  by common consent, and as facts of the moral instinct which nature, in  her wisdom, has given to man in order to serve as guide and teacher until  his enlightened intelligence gives him maturity. But this very technical  shape which renders truth visible to the understanding conceals it from  the feelings; for, unhappily, understanding begins by destroying the  object of the inner sense before it can appropriate the object. Like the  chemist, the philosopher finds synthesis only by analysis, or the  spontaneous work of nature only through the torture of art. Thus, in  order to detain the fleeting apparition, he must enchain it in the  fetters of rule, dissect its fair proportions into abstract notions, and  preserve its living spirit in a fleshless skeleton of words. Is it  surprising that natural feeling should not recognize itself in such a  copy, and if in the report of the analyst the truth appears as paradox?    Permit me therefore to crave your indulgence if the following researches  should remove their object from the sphere of sense while endeavoring to  draw it towards the understanding. That which I before said of moral  experience can be applied with greater truth to the manifestation of \"the  beautiful.\" It is the mystery which enchants, and its being is  extinguished with the extinction of the necessary combination of its  elements.          LETTER II.      But I might perhaps make a better use of the opening you afford me if I  were to direct your mind to a loftier theme than that of art. It would  appear to be unseasonable to go in search of a code for the aesthetic  world, when the moral world offers matter of so much higher interest, and  when the spirit of philosophical inquiry is so stringently challenged by  the circumstances of our times to occupy itself with the most perfect of  all works of art--the establishment and structure of a true political  freedom.    It is unsatisfactory to live out of your own age and to work for other  times. It is equally incumbent on us to be good members of our own age  as of our own state or country. If it is conceived to be unseemly and  even unlawful for a man to segregate himself from the customs and manners  of the circle in which he lives, it would be inconsistent not to see that  it is equally his duty to grant a proper share of influence to the voice  of his own epoch, to its taste and its requirements, in the operations in  which he engages.    But the voice of our age seems by no means favorable to art, at all  events to that kind of art to which my inquiry is directed. The course  of events has given a direction to the genius of the time that threatens  to remove it continually further from the ideal of art. For art has to  leave reality, it has to raise itself boldly above necessity and  neediness; for art is the daughter of freedom, and it requires its  prescriptions and rules to be furnished by the necessity of spirits and  not by that of matter. But in our day it is necessity, neediness, that  prevails, and lends a degraded humanity under its iron yoke. Utility is  the great idol of the time, to which all powers do homage and all  subjects are subservient. In this great balance on utility, the  spiritual service of art has no weight, and, deprived of all  encouragement, it vanishes from the noisy Vanity Fair of our time. The  very spirit of philosophical inquiry itself robs the imagination of one  promise after another, and the frontiers of art are narrowed in  proportion as the limits of science are enlarged.    The eyes of the philosopher as well as of the man of the world are  anxiously turned to the theatre of political events, where it is presumed  the great destiny of man is to be played out. It would almost seem to  betray a culpable indifference to the welfare of society if we did not  share this general interest. For this great commerce in social and moral  principles is of necessity a matter of the greatest concern to every  human being, on the ground both of its subject and of its results. It  must accordingly be of deepest moment to every man to think for himself.  It would seem that now at length a question that formerly was only  settled by the law of the stronger is to be determined by the calm  judgment of the reason, and every man who is capable of placing himself  in a central position, and raising his individuality into that of his  species, can look upon himself as in possession of this judicial faculty  of reason; being moreover, as man and member of the human family, a party  in the case under trial and involved more or less in its decisions. It  would thus appear that this great political process is not only engaged  with his individual case,"]]]
