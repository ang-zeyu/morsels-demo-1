I had had a choice band of them in private training for some time,  and the date was now arriving for their first public effort.    This experiment was baseball.  In order to give the thing vogue  from the start, and place it out of the reach of criticism, I chose  my nines by rank, not capacity.  There wasn't a knight in either  team who wasn't a sceptered sovereign.  As for material of this  sort, there was a glut of it always around Arthur.  You couldn't  throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king.  Of course,  I couldn't get these people to leave off their armor; they wouldn't  do that when they bathed.  They consented to differentiate the  armor so that a body could tell one team from the other, but that  was the most they would do.  So, one of the teams wore chain-mail  ulsters, and the other wore plate-armor made of my new Bessemer  steel.  Their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing I  ever saw.  Being ball-proof, they never skipped out of the way,  but stood still and took the result; when a Bessemer was at the bat  and a ball hit him, it would bound a hundred and fifty yards  sometimes.  And when a man was running, and threw himself on his  stomach to slide to his base, it was like an iron-clad coming into  port.  At first I appointed men of no rank to act as umpires, but  I had to discontinue that.  These people were no easier to please  than other nines.  The umpire's first decision was usually his  last; they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him  home on a shutter.  When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived  a game, umpiring got to be unpopular.  So I was obliged to appoint  somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would  protect him.    Here are the names of the nines:         BESSEMERS                   ULSTERS       KING ARTHUR.                EMPEROR LUCIUS.     KING LOT OF LOTHIAN.        KING LOGRIS.     KING OF NORTHGALIS.         KING MARHALT OF IRELAND.     KING MARSIL.                KING MORGANORE.     KING OF LITTLE BRITAIN.     KING MARK OF CORNWALL.     KING LABOR.                 KING NENTRES OF GARLOT.     KING PELLAM OF LISTENGESE.  KING MELIODAS OF LIONES.     KING BAGDEMAGUS.            KING OF THE LAKE.     KING TOLLEME LA FEINTES.    THE SOWDAN OF SYRIA.                      Umpire--CLARENCE.    The first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people;  and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see.  Everything would be favorable; it was balmy and beautiful spring  weather now, and Nature was all tailored out in her new clothes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7250"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 9.

Ye shall all die in this place--every one--except _him_.  He sleepeth now--and shall sleep thirteen centuries.  I am Merlin!\"    Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled  about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one  of our wires.  His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still  laughing.  I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until  the corpse turns to dust.    The Boss has never stirred--sleeps like a stone.  If he does not  wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and  his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses  of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it.  As for  the rest of us--well, it is agreed that if any one of us ever  escapes alive from this place, he will write the fact here, and  loyally hide this Manuscript with The Boss, our dear good chief,  whose property it is, be he alive or dead.        THE END OF THE MANUSCRIPT            FINAL P.S. BY M.T.    The dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside.  The rain  had almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm  was sighing and sobbing itself to rest.  I went to the stranger's  room, and listened at his door, which was slightly ajar.  I could  hear his voice, and so I knocked.  There was no answer, but I still  heard the voice.  I peeped in.  The man lay on his back in bed,  talking brokenly but with spirit, and punctuating with his arms,  which he thrashed about, restlessly, as sick people do in delirium.  I slipped in softly and bent over him.  His mutterings and  ejaculations went on.  I spoke--merely a word, to call his attention.  His glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with  pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:    \"Oh, Sandy, you are come at last--how I have longed for you!  Sit  by me--do not leave me--never leave me again, Sandy, never again.  Where is your hand?--give it me, dear, let me hold it--there  --now all is well, all is peace, and I am happy again--_we_ are happy  again, isn't it so, Sandy?  You are so dim, so vague, you are but  a mist, a cloud, but you are _here_, and that is blessedness sufficient;  and I have your hand; don't take it away--it is for only a little  while, I shall not require it long....  Was that the child?...  Hello-Central!... she doesn't answer.  Asleep, perhaps?  Bring her  when she wakes, and let me touch her hands, her face, her hair,  and tell her good-bye....  Sandy!  Yes, you are there.  I lost  myself a moment, and I thought you were gone....  Have I been  sick long?  It must be so; it seems months to me.  And such dreams!  such strange and awful dreams, Sandy!  Dreams that were as real  as reality--delirium, of course, but _so_ real!  Why, I thought  the king was dead, I thought you were in Gaul and couldn't get  home, I thought there was a revolution; in the fantastic frenzy  of these dreams, I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of  my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England!  But even that was not the strangest.  I seemed to be a creature  out of a remote unborn age, centuries hence, and even _that_ was  as real as the rest!  Yes, I seemed to have flown back out of that  age into this of ours, and then forward to it again, and was set  down, a stranger and forlorn in that strange England, with an  abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you! between  me and my home and my friends! between me and all that is dear  to me, all that could make life worth the living!  It was awful  --awfuler than you can ever imagine, Sandy.  Ah, watch by me, Sandy  --stay by me every moment--_don't_ let me go out of my mind again;  death is nothing, let it come, but not with those dreams, not with  the torture of those hideous dreams--I cannot endure _that_ again....  Sandy?...\"    He lay muttering incoherently some little time; then for a time he  lay silent, and apparently sinking away toward death.  Presently  his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet, and by that sign  I knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the  death-rattle in his throat he started up slightly, and seemed  to listen: then he said:    \"A bugle?...  It is the king!  The drawbridge, there!  Man the  battlements!--turn out the--\"    He was getting up his last \"effect\"; but he never finished it."]]]
