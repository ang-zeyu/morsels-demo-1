CAMPBELL'S"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/542"],[0,"The Life of Me: An Autobiography (#7)"],[1,"the smaller children would each get a stick of candy  for staying home while the larger ones went down on the creek in  Grandma's pasture.  However, wading in water in our own pasture  after summer rain showers usually included all of us, the  youngest and all.  It was understood that the oldest of the bunch  was always the boss and had the responsibility for the safety and  well-being of the entire party.    Whether we were working or playing, that rule of command held  true in our family.  And it was not the only ironclad ruling in  the Johnson family--rulings which stood through the years without  question and with no thought of breaking.    We always had a set of four boxing gloves.  I say always because  I can't remember when we didn't have them.  And in boxing, we  obeyed the rules of not hitting in the face nor below the belt.  Another strict rule was, \"Don't get mad at your opponent when he  is giving you a beating.  If you get mad, you mustn't play  anymore.\"  The same held true in wrestling.  If you couldn't  stand to be pinned down, you just didn't wrestle.    You can bet your boots, we all boxed and we all wrestled.  No one  wanted to be left out of the action.  And the only way to stay in  the action was to obey the rules and take whatever the other one  dished out.    This didn't mean that the big kids were unmerciful to the little  ones.  There was another rule, \"Don't hurt the little ones.  Don't hold the little one down after he yells 'calf rope.'  Back  away and let him have a new start.\"    We all played \"rough and rowdy,\" but always with smiles on our  faces.  And the rules of fair play applied to our animals also.    We had a big dog that was part Collie and part Shepherd.  He grew  up with us kids and became one of the family.  We named him  Scotch.  Papa brought him to us kids at the Exum place when he  was a wee, little woolly ball of bouncing, playful puppy.  Papa  had given five dollars for him, which was a lot of money for our  family in those days.  He was the only dog our family ever owned.    According to his bloodlines, he was half Collie and half  Shepherd, but according to us Johnson kids, he was just all dog--  a gentleman canine of the highest order, a true friend, guardian  and protector of children, truly a little boy's best friend.    We were taught never to abuse Old Scotch while he was a puppy,  and as he grew older, we couldn't abuse him, he wouldn't allow  it.  And we were told never to call him without a good reason,  such as to feed him, play with him or let him go hunting with us.  Papa told us that if the dog trusted us, he would obey us better.    I guess that was good advice.  At any rate, Old Scotch obeyed  orders and commands better and more promptly than any other dog I  have ever seen, either in or out of the movies.  He even obeyed  requests which were not meant as commands.    We kids didn't really know how to train the dog.  We just let him  grow up with us and by the time he was a year old, he was smarter  and better looking than most of us kids.    However, we did teach Old Scotch to do a few simple little  tricks-  -nothing spectacular.  He would sit down when we told him to.  And he would hold still while we placed a small stick on top of  his nose, and remain still until we counted to three.  Then at  the count of three, he would quickly flip it off his nose and  catch it in his mouth.  Then of course, he expected a pat of  congratulations and a kind word or two.    We taught him to keep the chickens off the porch and out of the  yard.  That was an easy job.  He soon learned to do it without  having to be told.    We kids liked to sit under the steering wheel of our car and  pretend we were driving.  Soon Old Scotch was doing the same  thing.  Sometimes when we kids opened the car door, we would have  to hurry or Old Scotch would beat us to the steering wheel.  He  was only playing with us kids when he did that.  He wouldn't do  Papa that way.    One of his favorite games was to take a stick in his mouth and  challenge us to a game of wolf-over-the-river.  He liked for us  to try to catch him and take the stick.  He also liked to play  catch--but only with a rubber ball.  We would pitch the ball to  him and he would catch it and return it to us.  However, there  was a strict rule in this game--never throw a hard ball to him,  because that would hurt his teeth and he would begin to distrust  and disobey us.    He learned not to trust some of the neighbor kids.  They  sometimes threw him a hard ball.  They didn't \"Do unto Old Scotch  as they would have Old Scotch do unto them.\"    At times we would offer the dog something to eat that he had  never seen nor tasted before, and if he wasn't sure of it, he  might reject it.  But he seemed to have enough faith in us boys  to think that, if he could see us eat some of it, then he would  not be afraid to try it.  So, we would let him see us eat some of  it, or at least we would pretend to eat it.    Our dog didn't have the long Collie-like nose, but rather a  beautiful short nose like the Alaskan Husky.  Nor was his coat  long and stringy but was short and heavy, more like the wool of a  sheep before shearing.  His color was a deep reddish brown, with  just the right touches of white about the head.  His body was  round and full.  His shoulders and hips were broad, as though  somewhere in his ancestry there was most certainly a St. Bernard.    Old Scotch couldn't bear the sound of thunder.  During a  thunderstorm he wanted to go in the house and get under a bed.  That's the only time we ever let him in the house.  The noise  must have hurt his ears.  Firecrackers affected him the same way.  He would tolerate the noise of a rifle when he was out hunting  with us, but he wouldn't allow even his best friends to aim  anything at him.    Needless to say, we would never aim a gun at him any more than we  would aim one at each other.  But a broomstick or a hoe handle  was like a gun to Old Scotch.  When we aimed something at him, he  wouldn't bite us to really tear us apart, but he would certainly  bite hard enough to make us drop the object we were pointing at  him.  He would growl in a way that told us for sure that he would  not allow anyone to point anything at him.    Old Scotch saved us many a step and earned his keep many times  over.  We kept our milk-pen calves in the lot through the day.  Then we kept our milk cows in the lot at night and let the calves  run out to graze.  Next morning we would tell Old Scotch to go  get the calves and he would.  He wouldn't get the horses nor the  other cows--only the milk-pen calves.    After we ate breakfast and did the morning chores and were ready  to harness the horses for plowing, we would send Old Scotch after  the horses and he would get only the horses, no cows nor calves.  In the afternoon we would tell him to go get the milk cows and he  would bring only the cows, no horses.    When we called our dog, we didn't say, \"Here, Scotch!  Here,  here, here.\"  The word we used wasn't \"here,\" it was \"how.\"  And  no matter how far away he was, he would come immediately when he  heard us call.  He only paused long enough to make sure it was  one of our family calling him and to get the direction from which  the call came.    And when he came to us, he didn't come walking nor trotting, but  loping.  And he didn't stop a few steps away nor lower his head  and ears, nor did he approach with his tail down.  He bounced  right up beside us, full of life and gusto as if to ask, \"Oh boy!  What kind of excitement do you have planned for me this time?\"    It's a common thing to see a two-car family in the 1970's, but we  were a two-car family as early as 1916.  We still had the Reo and  Papa bought a Big Six seven-passenger Buick touring car.  Old  Scotch knew that Buick by sound.  Uncle Robert had a Little Six  Buick that sounded almost like the Big Six.  Our dog could  recognize the sound of those Buicks a half-mile away.    When other cars drove by along the road, Old Scotch would pay no  attention to them.  We had taught him not to chase cars.  But  when either of those Buicks came along, he would run out to greet  it a quarter-mile away.  He also accepted Robert as a personal  friend as well as a friend to our family.    Then one day Old Scotch didn't come when we called him.  Nor did  he come the next day.  We had no idea where he had gone nor why.  Of course, we kept hoping that some day he would return.  But  days became weeks and weeks became months and the dog was still  missing.  By this time we had given up all hope of ever seeing  him again.    Papa and Mama taught us to be nice to our animals and taught us  how to get Old Scotch to obey us.  And there seemed to be no end  to the little things they taught us how to do.  In a jiffy they  could cut a slot in the side of a pumpkin leaf stem and make us a  horn to blow.  They showed us how to put a chicken's head under  his wing, swing him a few times and lay him down on the ground,  fast asleep.  Papa taught us how to tie a certain kind of a knot  in a rope for one occasion and another kind for another purpose.  And he taught us how to make a loop for roping calves.    We owed a lot to our parents for making our lives pleasant and  exciting.  They were among the most respected parents in our  community.  They were leaders--not in organizations concerned  with business or big government, nor in local clubs, but they  were upstanding church-goers with high standards of moral  character and integrity.  As in play, so in life, they wanted  their children to abide by a set of rules which would lead them  into a good life--a life of knowledge of the difference between  good and evil, with a desire to do the good and shun the evil.    They may not have thought of God as some of us do today but I am  sure they did what they thought was right, and they did it with  consistency and sincerity.  More than that we have no right"]]]
