It is the  principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power  over all temporal as well as eternal things. Take this principle or  attribute--for it is an attribute--from the Deity, and he would cease  to exist.    \"Who cannot see, that if God framed the worlds by faith, that it is  by faith that he exercises power over them, and that faith is the  principle of power? And if the principle of power, must be so in man as  well as in the Deity? This is the testimony of all the sacred writers,  and the lesson which they have been endeavoring to teach to man. * * * *    \"It was by faith that the worlds were framed. God spake, chaos heard,  and worlds came into order by reason of the faith there was in him. So  with man also; he spake by faith in the name of God and the sun stood  still, the moon obeyed, mountains removed, prisons fell, lions' mouths  were closed, the human heart lost its enmity, fire its violence, armies  their power, the sword its terror, and death its dominion; and all this  by reason of the faith which was in him.    \"Had it not been for the faith which was in men, they might have spoken  to the sun, the moon, the mountains, prisons, the human heart, fire,  armies, the sword, or to death, in vain!    \"Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has power,  dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by it they  remain, agreeable to the will of God. Without it there is no power, and  without power there could be no creation nor existence!\"    A Negative Opinion.--A Christian minister (a Unitarian) once tried to  convince me that faith was anything but an admirable quality. He called  it contemptible, declaring that it consisted simply of a willingness to  believe anything, however improbable or absurd: it was mere credulity,  nothing more. When I spoke of faith as a spiritual force, he said I  was attaching to the term a significance that it had never borne, and  for which there was no warrant. I reminded him of the Savior's words  in Matt. 17:19,20: \"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye  shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it  shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\" Whereupon he  answered flippantly: \"Oh, it takes picks and shovels to move mountains.\"    The Positive View.--I presume he would have conceded, had I pursued  the subject further, that there are other ways of removing mountains.  I fancy he would have admitted the power of the earthquake in the  premises; though he might not have agreed with me that all intelligent  action, human or divine, is the result of faith, and that whether  mountains are moved with pick-axes or with earthquakes, by man or  by his Maker, it is faith that precedes the action and renders it  possible. This professed minister of Christ, who denied what Christ had  taught, overlooked the fact that the smallest as well as the greatest  acts of our lives spring from the exercise of faith.    Faith Fundamental.--God made faith the first principle of the gospel,  because that is its proper place. It is the bottom round in the ladder  of salvation, the first step in the stairway to perfection. \"All things  are possible to them that believe.\"    \"As a Grain of Mustard Seed.\"--When the Savior spoke of the faith  that \"removes mountains,\" he was not measuring, either satirically or  hyperbolically, the quantity of the faith by the size of the mustard  seed. He probably meant that if man would obey the divine law given  for his government, as faithfully as the mustard seed obeys the divine  law given for its government, he would have infinitely more power than  he now possesses. How difficult it seems for man, \"the noblest work  of God,\" to live in obedience to the highest principles revealed from  heaven for his guidance. Yet the earth, we are told, \"abideth the law  of a celestial kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and  transgresseth not the law\" (D&C 88:25).    Faith and Credulity.--Faith, in its incipient stages, may resemble at  times mere credulity. The untutored savage who was told by one of the  early settlers of New England that if he planted grass seed it would  produce gunpowder, believed it, not yet having learned that the white  man would lie. He therefore parted with his valuable furs, in exchange  for some of the seed, showing that he had faith in the settler's word.  But it did not bring the desired result. Faith, to be effectual,  must be based upon truth, and though higher than reason, must have a  reasonable foundation. The spirit of truth must inspire it. This was  not the case with the poor, misguided Indian; he trusted in a falsehood  and was deceived. But some good came of it. He ascertained the falsity  of the settler's statement. His faith induced him to plant the seed,  and though it did not produce gunpowder--that being contrary to its  nature--it produced a growth of grass-and a wiser Indian.        CHAPTER III.    Faith, Continued.    Faith Founded on Evidence.--The second of the Lectures on Faith is a  discussion of the object upon which faith should rest; that object  being God, the evidences of whose existence, as the foundation of all  rational belief, are abundantly shown. Lecture Third contains these  paragraphs, pertinent to the point now raised:    Essentials for a Perfect Faith.--\"Three things are necessary in order  that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto  life and salvation.    \"First, the idea that he actually exists.    \"Second, a correct idea of his character, perfections, and attributes.    \"Third, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he [man] is  pursuing is according to his [God's] will. For without an acquaintance  with these three important facts, the faith of every rational being  must be imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding it  can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness, unto the  praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.\"    Possibilities of Faith.--Had the Indian's faith been properly  founded--had it been a perfect faith, intelligent, rational,  heaven-inspired, he could have produced gunpowder or any other  commodity from the all-containing elements around him; and that,  too, without planting a seed or employing an ordinary process of  manufacture. The turning of water into wine, the miraculous feeding of  the multitude, the walking upon the waves, the healing of the sick,  the raising of the dead, and other wonderful works wrought by the  Savior, the apostles, and the ancient prophets--what were they but  manifestations of an all-powerful faith, to possess which is to have  the power to remove mountains--without picks and shovels, my skeptical  Unitarian to the contrary notwithstanding. Such a faith is not mere  credulity; it is a divine energy, operating upon natural laws and by  natural processes--natural, though unknown to \"the natural man,\" and  termed by him supernatural.    The Universal Mainspring.--Faith is the beating heart of the  universe--the incentive, the impulse, to all action, the mainspring  of all achievement. Nothing was ever accomplished, small or great,  commonplace or miraculous, that was not backed up by confidence in  some power, human or superhuman, that impelled and pushed forward the  enterprise.    An Impelling Force.--It was not doubt that drove Columbus across the  sea; it was faith--the impelling force of the Spirit of the Lord (1  Ne. 13:12). It was not doubt that nerved the arm and fired the soul of  Washington, inducing him and his ragged regiments to fight on through  heat, frost, and hunger of seven long years, to win their country's  freedom. It was not doubt that inspired Hamilton, Jefferson, Franklin,  and the other patriot fathers, to lay broad and deep the foundations of  this mighty republic. It is not doubt that has caused nations to rise  and flourish, and raised up great men in all ages and in all climes,  to teach, toil, and sacrifice for the benefit of mankind. It is faith  that does such things. Doubt undoes, or hinders, what faith achieves.  The men and women who have moved this world were men and women who  believed, who were earnest and sincere, even if in part mistaken.    Mahomet and Islam.--Carlyle portrays vividly the wondrous transition  from weakness to strength that came over the descendants of Ishmael,  when they became a believing nation, abandoning idolatry, and accepting  Allah as their god, with Mahomet as his prophet:    \"To the Arab nation it was as a birth from darkness into light;  Arabia first became alive by means of it. A poor shepherd people  roaming unnoticed in its deserts since the creation of the world; a  hero-prophet was sent down to them with a word they could believe; see,  the unnoticed becomes world-notable, the small has become world-great;  within one century afterwards Arabia is at Granada on this hand, at  Delhi on that--glancing in valor and splendor and the light of genius,  Arabia shines through long ages over a great section of the world.  Belief is great, life-giving. The history of a nation becomes fruitful,  soul-elevating, great, so soon as it believes. These Arabs, the man  Mahomet, and that one century--is it not as if a spark had fallen, one  spark, on a world of what seemed black, unnoticeable sand; but lo,  the sand proves explosive powder, blazes heaven-high from Delhi to  Granada! I said, the great man was always as lightning out of heaven;  the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would  flame.\"--(\"Heroes and Hero Worship,\" Lecture II.)

Oh, Hetty!\" was all she could say, and she seized a  chair to keep from falling, while Hetty was nearly wild, and talked like  a crazy person.    \"Oh, goody! goody! now you can have things to eat! and we can have a  candle! and you won't have to go to the poorhouse!\"    \"No, indeed, you dear child!\" cried Miss Bennett who had found her  voice. \"Thanks to you--you blessing!--I shall be comfortable now the  rest of my days. And you! oh! I shall never forget you! Through you has  everything good come to me.\"    \"Oh, but you have been so good to me, dear Miss Bennett!\"    \"I should never have guessed it, you precious child! If it had not been  for your quickness I should have died and never found it.\"    \"And if you hadn't given me the box, it might have rusted away in that  chest.\"    \"Thank God for everything, child! Take money out of my purse and go buy  a candle. We need not save it for bread now. Oh, child!\" she interrupted  herself, \"do you know, we shall have everything we want to-morrow. Go!  Go! I want to see how much there is.\"    The candle bought, the gold was taken out and counted, and proved to  be more than enough to give Miss Bennett a comfortable income without  touching the principal. It was put back, and the tile replaced, as the  safest place to keep it till morning, when Miss Bennett intended to put  it into a bank.    But though they went to bed, there was not a wink of sleep for Miss  Bennett, for planning what she would do. There were a thousand things  she wanted to do first. To get clothes for Hetty, to brighten up the old  house, to hire a girl to relieve Hetty, so that the dear child should  go to school, to train her into a noble woman--all her old ambitions and  wishes for herself sprang into life for Hetty. For not a thought of her  future life was separate from Hetty.    In a very short time everything was changed in Miss Bennett's cottage.  She had publicly adopted Hetty, and announced her as her heir. A girl  had been installed in the kitchen, and Hetty, in pretty new clothes, had  begun school. Fresh paint inside and out, with many new comforts, made  the old house charming and bright. But nothing could change the pleasant  and happy relations between the two friends, and a more contented and  cheerful household could not be found anywhere.    Happiness is a wonderful doctor and Miss Bennett grew so much better,  that she could travel, and when Hetty had finished school days, they saw  a little of the world before they settled down to a quiet, useful life.    \"Every comfort on earth I owe to you,\" said Hetty, one day, when Miss  Bennett had proposed some new thing to add to her enjoyment.    \"Ah, dear Hetty! how much do I owe to you! But for you, I should, no  doubt, be at this moment a shivering pauper in that terrible poorhouse,  while some one else would be living in this dear old house. And it all  comes,\" she added softly, \"of that one unselfish thought, of that one  self-denial for others.\"          VI. LITTLE GIRL'S CHRISTMAS    WINNIFRED E. LINCOLN    It was Christmas Eve, and Little Girl had just hung up her stocking  by the fireplace--right where it would be all ready for Santa when he  slipped down the chimney. She knew he was coming, because--well, because  it was Christmas Eve, and because he always had come to leave gifts for  her on all the other Christmas Eves that she could remember, and because  she had seen his pictures everywhere down town that afternoon when she  was out with Mother.    Still, she wasn't JUST satisfied. 'Way down in her heart she was a  little uncertain--you see, when you have never really and truly seen  a person with your very own eyes, it's hard to feel as if you exactly  believed in him--even though that person always has left beautiful gifts  for you every time he has come.    \"Oh, he'll come,\" said Little Girl; \"I just know he will be here before  morning, but somehow I wish--\"    \"Well, what do you wish?\" said a Tiny Voice close by her--so close that  Little Girl fairly jumped when she heard it.    \"Why, I wish I could SEE Santa myself. I'd just like to go and see  his house and his workshop, and ride in his sleigh, and know Mrs.  Santa--'twould be such fun, and then I'd KNOW for sure.\"    \"Why don't you go, then?\" said Tiny Voice. \"It's easy enough. Just try  on these Shoes, and take this Light in your hand, and you'll find your  way all right.\"    So Little Girl looked down on the hearth, and there were two cunning  little Shoes side by side, and a little Spark of a Light close to  them--just as if they were all made out of one of the glowing coals of  the wood-fire. Such cunning Shoes as they were--Little Girl could hardly  wait to pull off her slippers and try them on. They looked as if they  were too small, but they weren't--they fitted exactly right, and just  as Little Girl had put them both on and had taken the Light in her hand,  along came a little Breath of Wind, and away she went up the chimney,  along with ever so many other little Sparks, past the Soot Fairies, and  out into the Open Air, where Jack Frost and the Star Beams were all busy  at work making the world look pretty for Christmas.    Away went Little Girl--Two Shoes, Bright Light, and all--higher and  higher, until she looked like a wee bit of a star up in the sky. It was  the funniest thing, but she seemed to know the way perfectly, and didn't  have to stop to make inquiries anywhere. You see it was a straight road  all the way, and when one doesn't have to think about turning to the  right or the left, it makes things very much easier. Pretty soon Little  Girl noticed that there was a bright light all around her--oh, a very  bright light--and right away something down in her heart began to make  her feel very happy indeed. She didn't know that the Christmas spirits  and little Christmas fairies were all around her and even right inside  her, because she couldn't see a single one of them, even though her eyes  were very bright and could usually see a great deal.    But that was just it, and Little Girl felt as if she wanted to laugh and  sing and be glad. It made her remember the Sick Boy who lived next door,  and she said to herself that she would carry him one of her prettiest  picture-books in the morning, so that he could have something to make  him happy all day. By and by, when the bright light all around her had  grown very, very much brighter, Little Girl saw a path right in front of  her, all straight and trim, leading up a hill to a big, big house  with ever and ever so many windows in it. When she had gone just a bit  nearer, she saw candles in every window, red and green and yellow ones,  and every one burning brightly, so Little Girl knew right away that  these were Christmas candles to light her on her journey, and make the  way dear for her, and something told her that this was Santa's house,  and that pretty soon she would perhaps see Santa himself.    Just as she neared the steps and before she could possibly have had time  to ring the bell, the door opened--opened of itself as wide as could  be--and there stood--not Santa himself--don't think it--but a funny  Little Man with slender little legs and a roly-poly stomach which shook  every now and then when he laughed. You would have known right away,  just as Little Girl knew, that he was a very happy little man, and you  would have guessed right away, too, that the reason he was so roly-poly  was because he laughed and chuckled and smiled all the time--for it's  only sour, cross folks who are thin and skimpy. Quick as a wink, he  pulled off his little peaked red cap, smiled the broadest kind of a  smile, and said, \"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Come in! Come in!\"    So in went Little Girl, holding fast to Little Man's hand, and when she  was really inside there was the jolliest, reddest fire all glowing and  snapping, and there were Little Man and all his brothers and sisters,  who said their names were \"Merry Christmas,\" and \"Good Cheer,\" and ever  so many other jolly-sounding things, and there were such a lot of them  that Little Girl just knew she never could count them, no matter how  long she tried.    All around her were bundles and boxes and piles of toys and games, and  Little Girl knew that these were all ready and waiting to be loaded into  Santa's big sleigh for his reindeer to whirl them away over cloudtops  and snowdrifts to the little people down below who had left their  stockings all ready for him. Pretty soon all the little Good Cheer  Brothers began to hurry and bustle and carry out the bundles as fast as  they could to the steps where Little Girl could hear the jingling bells  and the stamping of hoofs. So Little Girl picked up some bundles and  skipped along too, for she wanted to help a bit herself--it's no fun  whatever at Christmas unless you can help, you know--and there in the  yard stood the BIGGEST sleigh that Little Girl had ever seen, and the  reindeer were all stamping and prancing and jingling the bells on their  harnesses, because they were so eager to be on their way to the Earth  once more.    She could hardly wait for Santa to come, and just as she had begun to  wonder where he was, the door opened again and out came a whole forest  of Christmas trees, at least it looked just as if a whole forest had  started out for a walk somewhere, but a second glance showed Little  Girl that there were thousands of Christmas sprites, and that each one  carried a tree or a big Christmas wreath on his back. Behind them all,  she could hear some one laughing loudly, and talking in a big, jovial  voice that sounded as if he were good friends with the whole world.    And straightway she knew that Santa himself was coming. Little Girl's  heart went pit-a-pat for a minute while she wondered if Santa would  notice her, but she didn't have to wonder long, for he spied her at once  and said:    \"Bless"]]]
