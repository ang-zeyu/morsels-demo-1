[2]    These ancient promises to God's people had also been renewed to the  Latter-day Saints in modern revelations to the Church through the  Prophet Joseph himself:        As I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every soul      who believeth on your words, and is baptized by water for the      remission of sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost; and these signs      shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall do many      wonderful works:        In my name they shall cast out devils;        In my name they shall heal the sick;        In my name they shall open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the      ears of the deaf; and the tongue of the dumb shall speak; and if      any man shall administer poison unto them it shall not hurt them. *      * * But a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not boast      themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world. [3]    Again, I say, to the Saints who witnessed the demonstration of God's  power on the 22nd of July, 1839, in the healing of the sick in  fulfillment of these promises ancient and modern, it was a witness to  them that God was with them and with their Prophet.

A REVELATION had been received by the Prophet Joseph on the eighth of  July, 1838, in which a commandment was given to fill up the quorum of  the Twelve Apostles by ordaining John Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford  Woodruff, and Willard Richards to take the places of those who had  fallen through apostasy. The following spring \"let them depart,\" said  the revelation, \"to go over the great waters, and there promulgate my  Gospel, the fullness thereof, and bear record of my name. Let them take  leave of my Saints in the city of Far West, on the twenty-sixth day of  April next, on the building spot of my house.\" By the twenty-sixth of  April, the day set for them to take leave of the Saints to start on  their mission, nearly all the members of The Church had been driven  from Far West. I have already related, however, in \"The Missouri  Persecutions\" how five of the Apostles and several who were to be  ordained returned by different routes to Far West, met with a few  of the Saints there and fulfilled the mandates of this revelation,  notwithstanding the boasts of the mob that it should fail. [1] For some  time the Apostles who started from the public square at Far West for  England were detained to aid in settling the Saints at Nauvoo, but the  latter part of the summer of 1839 found them making every exertion to  continue their journey.    Wilford Woodruff and John Taylor were the first of the quorum to leave  Nauvoo for England. Elder Woodruff at this time was living at Montrose,  and was rowed across the river in a canoe by Brigham Young. On landing,  he lay down to rest on a side of sole leather, near the post office.  While there Joseph came along and said: \"Well, Brother Woodruff, you  have started on your mission?\"    \"Yes, but I feel and look more like a subject for the dissecting room  than a missionary,\" was the reply.    \"What did you say that for?\" asked Joseph. \"Get up and go along, all  will be well with you.\"    Shortly afterwards Elder Woodruff was joined by Elder Taylor, and  together they started on their mission. On their way they passed Parley  P. Pratt, stripped, bareheaded and barefooted, hewing some logs for a  house. He hailed the brethren as they passed and gave them a purse,  though he had nothing to put in it. Elder Heber C. Kimball, who was but  a short distance away, stripped as Elder Pratt was, came up and said:  \"As Brother Parley has given you a purse, I have a dollar I will give  you to put in it.\" And mutually blessing each other, they separated to  meet again in foreign lands.    On the twenty-ninth of August, Parley P. Pratt and his brother Orson  started for England, leaving Nauvoo in their own carriage.    On the fourteenth of the following month Brigham Young left his home  at Montrose and started for England. He had been prostrated for some  time by sickness, and at the time of starting on his mission was so  feeble that he had to be assisted to the ferry, only some thirty rods  from his house. All his children were sick, and he left his wife with  a babe but ten days old, and in the poorest of circumstances, for the  mobs of Missouri had robbed him of all he had. After crossing the river  to the Nauvoo side, Israel Barlow took him on a horse behind him and  carried him to the house of Elder Heber C. Kimball, where his strength  altogether failed him, and he had to remain there for several days,  nursed by his wife, who, hearing that he was unable to get farther than  Brother Kimball's, had crossed the river from Montrose to care for him.    On the eighteenth of the month, however, Brigham, in company with  Heber C. Kimball, made another start. A brother by the name of Charles  Hubbard sent a boy with a team to take them a day's journey on their  way. Elder Kimball left his wife in bed shaking with ague, and all his  children sick. It was only by the assistance of some of the brethren  that Heber himself could climb into the wagon. \"It seemed to me,\" he  remarked afterwards in relating the circumstance, \"as though my very  inmost parts would melt within me at the thought of leaving my family  in such a condition, as it were, almost in the arms of death. I felt as  though I could scarcely endure it.\"    \"Hold up!\" said he to the teamster, who had just started. \"Brother  Brigham, this is pretty tough, but let us rise and give them a cheer.\"  Brigham, with much difficulty, rose to his feet, and joined Elder  Kimball in swinging his hat and shouting, \"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for  Israel!\" The two sisters hearing the cheer came to the door--Sister  Kimball with great difficulty--and waved a farewell; and the two  Apostles continued on their journey without purse, without scrip, for  England.    The departure of Elders George A. Smith, Reuben Hedlock, and Theodore  Turley was but little less remarkable. They were feeble in health, in  fact, down with the ague. Before they were out of sight of Nauvoo their  wagon upset, and spilled them down the bank of the river. Elders Smith  and Turley were unable to get up, not because of any injuries they had  received, but because of their illness. Elder Hedlock helped them into  their wagon and they resumed their journey. They had not proceeded far  when they met some gentlemen who stopped their team and said to the  driver: \"Mr., what graveyard have you been robbing?\" There mark being  elicited by the ghostly appearance of the Elders _en route_ for England.    Thus in sickness and poverty, without purse and without scrip, leaving  their families destitute of the comforts of life, with nothing but the  assurances of the people, who were as poor as themselves, that they  should be provided for, the Twelve turned their faces toward Europe, to  preach the Gospel to the highly civilized peoples of the world. Shaking  with the ague, and then burning up with the fever; now in the homes of  the wealthy, then in the hovels of the poor; now derided by the learned  and self-styled refined, and now welcomed by the poor of this world who  rejoiced in the message they bore--they journeyed on, never looking  back, nor complaining of the hardships through which they were called  to pass for the Master's sake. They had ringing in their ears the words  of Jesus:    \"He that loveth father or mother, houses or lands, wives or children  more than he loveth me is not worthy of me.\" And again they had the  promise: \"There is no man that hath left houses, or parents, or  brethren, or wife, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall  not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to  come life everlasting.\"    With this warning and this promise before them, they made their way by  different routes, but at last met in England, where an effectual door  was opened for the preaching of the Gospel, and thousands with joy  embraced the truth.    These men went out weeping, bearing precious seed; they returned in  time bringing their sheaves with them, and had joy in their harvest.  And what shall separate these men who endured so much for the Gospel's  sake, from the love of God? \"Shall tribulation, or distress, or  persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\" \"Nay, in all  these things they shall be more than conquerors through Him that loved  them.\"    Footnotes    1. Missouri Persecutions, Chapter XLVIII.        CHAPTER VIII.    THE \"TIMES AND SEASONS.\"    THE power of the press in sustaining the work he had begun, was  early recognized by Joseph Smith and his associates; and it was this  recognition of its powers which led him to establish, as early as  possible, a paper that would be under the control of The Church,  voice its sentiments and defend its principles. The Church had been  organized but eighteen months, and its membership was very small  when a conference held in Ohio authorized the purchase of a press,  and instructed W. W. Phelps to begin the publication of a paper in  Independence, Missouri. In June, 1832, the first number of that paper,  the _Evening and Morning Star_, was published.    The following year the _Evening and Morning Star_ press was broken and  the type scattered by the mob, which collected at Independence to drive  the Saints from Jackson County. The press and the book-binding property  were never again restored to The Church, though the _Star_ afterwards  reappeared in Kirtland, edited by Oliver Cowdery.    Another periodical was also published in Kirtland called _The Saints'  Messenger and Advocate_, the first number of which appeared in  December, 1833. This periodical was superseded in a few years--1837--by  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#7)"],[1,"day about 3,000 Saints met in the building in  a public service. It is most likely that the greater number of these  Saints were also at the dedication. It is not reasonable to suppose  that this building was dedicated until it was finished, for each part  had been dedicated as it was finished, and the dedication on the 1st of  May, 1846, was of the entire structure.[12]      THE REVELATION ON TEMPLE WORK.    I have now shown that the Temple was completed; that the Saints  were diligent in their labors, and they were also hindered by their  enemies. I now reaffirm what has previously been said; that it made no  difference, so far as the Church and its authority is concerned, even  if the Temple had not been completed, or finished, in the technical  sense of that word. Some of the embellishments, the ornamentations and  fixtures, may not have been placed in the building according to the  original intention, and in that technical sense the building may not  have been \"finished completely.\" But if so, what difference would it  make? The Lord, thank heaven, is not as technical and peevish as men  are, or woe be unto all of us. The revelation does not say that the  Church would be rejected with its dead if every identical board and  plank or fixture was not in the building according to the original  design. The thing the revelation does require is that a place be  prepared, or built, where the Lord could reveal the Priesthood and its  ordinances which had been taken away or that had not been restored.  And, too, if the temporary floors had not been replaced by the  permanent floors, the Lord could and would have revealed Himself to the  Saints and would have accepted of their offering. Now let's see just  what the revelation does say about this matter. Beginning at verse 25.        \"25. And again, verily I say unto you, let all my Saints come from      afar;        26. And send ye swift messengers, yea, chosen messengers, and say      unto them; come ye, with all your gold, and your silver, and your      precious stones, and with all your antiquities; and with all who      have knowledge of antiquities, that will come, may come, and bring      the box tree, and the fir tree, and the pine tree, together with      all the precious trees of the earth;        27. And with iron, with copper, and with brass, and with zinc, and      with all your precious things of the earth, and build a house to my      name, for the most High to dwell therein;        28. For there is not a place found on earth that he may come and      restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken      away, even the fulnesss of the Priesthood;        29. For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my      Saints, may be baptized for those who are dead;        30. For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be      acceptable to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are      not able to build a house unto me.        31. But I command you, all ye my Saints, to build a house unto me;      and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me,      and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.        32. But behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms for      your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these      things at the end of the appointment, ye shall be rejected as a      church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.        33. For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient      time to build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing      for the dead belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from      before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for your dead      cannot be acceptable unto me.        34. For therein (that is in Temples) are the keys of the Holy      Priesthood ordained that you may receive honor and glory.        35. And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those who      are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.        36. For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her stakes, and in      Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be      the places for your baptisms for your dead.        37. And again, verily I say unto you, How shall your washings be      acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you      have built to my name?        38. For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a      tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness,      and to build a house in the land of promise that those ordinances      might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was;        39. Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings and      your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn      assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices, by the sons of      Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you      receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the      beginning of the revelation and foundation of Zion, and for the      glory, honor, and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained      by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always      commanded to build unto my holy name.\"    I have read quite extensively from this revelation, now let us examine  and see just what is meant. At the time this revelation was given the  Saints were baptizing in the Mississippi river for their dead, this was  a special privilege that the Lord granted them in their poverty and  while they could prepare a place in the Temple for that ordinance. He  declares that while that place was being built He would accept of their  baptisms in the river, but just as soon as a place could be prepared  in the Temple baptisms for the dead in the river should cease. Now you  will notice that verse 31 reads:        \"But I command you, all ye my Saints, to build a house unto me; and      I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me.\"    Now I wish you to note what follows:        \"And during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.\"    I take it that this means that the Lord would accept of their baptisms  in the river until they could prepare a place where the ordinance  could be attended to properly, and that He would not discontinue river  baptisms until they had had sufficient time to build such a place. I  want to read what the president of the \"Reorganized\" Church has to say  on this point. Said he:        \"Baptisms for the dead was a permissive rite.\"    Of course I do not agree with him that it was a permissive rite, but to  continue the quotation:        \"Baptism for the dead was a permissive rite; or to write more      plainly, the Church was permitted by the Lord to baptize for the      dead under certain rules.\"    Here is the rule:        \"By terms stated in the revelation this permissive rite could be      performed and would be acceptable if performed in the river while      the time given the Church in which the Temple should be built was      passing. After the completion of the Temple, baptisms for the dead      were to be performed in it.\" (Saints' Herald, February 17, 1904).    We are certainly safe in saying that the Lord would not break His  promise, therefore if we can discover a time when baptisms were  discontinued in the river it will be a sign that the sufficient  time had expired, so far as baptisms in the river for the dead were  concerned. I turn to the minutes of the October conference, 1841, and  read from the remarks on baptism for the dead delivered by the Prophet  on the third day as follows:        \"There shall be no more baptisms for the dead until the ordinance      can be attended to in the font of the Lord's house; and the Church      shall not hold another general conference, until they can meet in      said house. _For thus saith the Lord!_\" (Times and Seasons, Vol.      II., page 578).    Remember this was in October, 1841--six months after the first stone  of the Temple was laid. Was the Temple finished? No. Was the Church  then rejected with its dead? Verily no! for this was 1841, and I have  already referred you to the editorial of the Prophet's of May, 1842,  wherein he says that never since the formation, or foundation, of the  Church was laid, have the Saints been so willing to comply with the  requisitions of Jehovah, and manifested a more ardent desire to do  the will of God, than in the building of that Temple. Therefore they  could not have been rejected. Yet the sufficient time was up.[13] What  must we then conclude? That the Temple had progressed so far that  baptisms could be performed in it for the dead in accordance with the  revelation, and it did not depend altogether, you will see, on the  complete finishing of the building; and as the rooms were finished one  by one and dedicated, they too, could be used for the ordinances of the  Temple until the whole Temple was built.    Are we right in our conclusion that a font had been built? Yes,  a temporary font had been built in the basement of the Temple--a  temporary one--but obviously one that answered the requirements of the  revelation. Moreover, in this temporary font, which was used by the  command of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith, baptisms for the  dead were performed from November, 1841, until it was replaced by the  permanent font, and then these baptisms continued in that until the  Saints were driven from Nauvoo.      BAPTISMS FOR THE DEAD OBLIGATORY.    We will now examine the thirty-second verse; it is:        \"But behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms for your      dead shall not be acceptable unto me.\"    That means, of course, the baptisms in the river shall not be  acceptable after the font is built. But listen to this:        \"And if you do not these things at the END OF THE APPOINTMENT ye      shall be rejected as a church, with your dead, saith"]]]
