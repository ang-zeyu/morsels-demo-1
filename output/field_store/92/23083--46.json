I do not deny that these evils exist at present; I say only that they  will not be remedied by such measures as the nationalization of  railways in the present economic and political environment.  A greater  upheaval, and a greater change in men's habits of mind, is necessary  for any really vital progress.      II    State socialism, even in a nation which possesses the form of  political democracy, is not a truly democratic system.  The way in  which it fails to be democratic may be made plain by an analogy from  the political sphere.  Every democrat recognizes that the Irish ought  to have self-government for Irish affairs, and ought not to be told  that they have no grievance because they share in the Parliament of  the United Kingdom.  It is essential to democracy that any group of  citizens whose interests or desires separate them at all widely from  the rest of the community should be free to decide their internal  affairs for themselves.  And what is true of national or local groups  is equally true of economic groups, such as miners or railway men.  The national machinery of general elections is by no means sufficient  to secure for groups of this kind the freedom which they ought to  have.    The power of officials, which is a great and growing danger in the  modern state, arises from the fact that the majority of the voters,  who constitute the only ultimate popular control over officials, are  as a rule not interested in any one particular question, and are  therefore not likely to interfere effectively against an official who  is thwarting the wishes of the minority who are interested.  The  official is nominally subject to indirect popular control, but not to  the control of those who are directly affected by his action.  The  bulk of the public will either never hear about the matter in dispute,  or, if they do hear, will form a hasty opinion based upon inadequate  information, which is far more likely to come from the side of the  officials than from the section of the community which is affected by  the question at issue.  In an important political issue, some degree  of knowledge is likely to be diffused in time; but in other matters  there is little hope that this will happen.    It may be said that the power of officials is much less dangerous than  the power of capitalists, because officials have no economic interests  that are opposed to those of wage-earners.  But this argument involves  far too simple a theory of political human nature--a theory which  orthodox socialism adopted from the classical political economy, and  has tended to retain in spite of growing evidence of its falsity.  Economic self-interest, and even economic class-interest, is by no  means the only important political motive.  Officials, whose salary is  generally quite unaffected by their decisions on particular questions,  are likely, if they are of average honesty, to decide according to  their view of the public interest; but their view will none the less  have a bias which will often lead them wrong.  It is important to  understand this bias before entrusting our destinies too unreservedly  to government departments.    The first thing to observe is that, in any very large organization,  and above all in a great state, officials and legislators are usually  very remote from those whom they govern, and not imaginatively  acquainted with the conditions of life to which their decisions will  be applied.  This makes them ignorant of much that they ought to know,  even when they are industrious and willing to learn whatever can be  taught by statistics and blue-books.  The one thing they understand  intimately is the office routine and the administrative rules.  The  result is an undue anxiety to secure a uniform system.  I have heard  of a French minister of education taking out his watch, and remarking,  \"At this moment all the children of such and such an age in France are  learning so and so.\" This is the ideal of the administrator, an ideal  utterly fatal to free growth, initiative, experiment, or any far  reaching innovation.  Laziness is not one of the motives recognized in  textbooks on political theory, because all ordinary knowledge of human  nature is considered unworthy of the dignity of these works; yet we  all know that laziness is an immensely powerful motive with all but a  small minority of mankind.    Unfortunately, in this case laziness is reinforced by love of power,  which leads energetic officials to create the systems which lazy  officials like to administer.  The energetic official inevitably  dislikes anything that he does not control.  His official sanction  must be obtained before anything can be done.  Whatever he finds in  existence he wishes to alter in some way, so as to have the  satisfaction of feeling his power and making it felt.  If he is  conscientious, he will think out some perfectly uniform and rigid  scheme which he believes to be the best possible, and he will then  impose this scheme ruthlessly, whatever promising growths he may have  to lop down for the sake of symmetry.  The result inevitably has  something of the deadly dullness of a new rectangular town, as  compared with the beauty and richness of an ancient city which has  lived and grown with the separate lives and individualities of many  generations.  What has grown is always more living than what has been  decreed; but the energetic official will always prefer the tidiness of  what he has decreed to the apparent disorder of spontaneous growth.    The mere possession of power tends to produce a love of power, which  is a very dangerous motive, because the only sure proof of power  consists in preventing others from doing what they wish to do.  The  essential theory of democracy is the diffusion of power among the  whole people, so that the evils produced by one man's possession of  great power shall be obviated.  But the diffusion of power through  democracy is only effective when the voters take an interest in the  question involved.  When the question does not interest them, they do  not attempt to control the administration, and all actual power passes  into the hands of officials.    For this reason, the true ends of democracy are not achieved by state  socialism or by any system which places great power in the hands of  men subject to no popular control except that which is more or less  indirectly exercised through parliament.    Any fresh survey of men's political actions shows that, in those who  have enough energy to be politically effective, love of power is a  stronger motive than economic self-interest.  Love of power actuates  the great millionaires, who have far more money than they can spend,  but continue to amass wealth merely in order to control more and more  of the world's finance.[2]  Love of power is obviously the ruling  motive of many politicians.  It is also the chief cause of wars, which  are admittedly almost always a bad speculation from the mere point of  view of wealth.  For this reason, a new economic system which merely  attacks economic motives and does not interfere with the concentration  of power is not likely to effect any very great improvement in the  world.  This is one of the chief reasons for regarding state socialism  with suspicion.    [2] Cf. J. A. Hobson, \"The Evolution of Modern Capitalism.\"      III    The problem of the distribution of power is a more difficult one than  the problem of the distribution of wealth.  The machinery of  representative government has concentrated on _ultimate_ power as the  only important matter, and has ignored immediate executive power.  Almost nothing has been done to democratize administration.  Government officials, in virtue of their income, security, and social  position, are likely to be on the side of the rich, who have been  their daily associates ever since the time of school and college.  And  whether or not they are on the side of the rich, they are not likely,  for the reasons we have been considering, to be genuinely in favor of  progress.  What applies to government officials applies also to  members of Parliament, with the sole difference that they have had to  recommend themselves to a constituency.  This, however, only adds  hypocrisy to the other qualities of a ruling caste.  Whoever has stood  in the lobby of the House of Commons watching members emerge with  wandering eye and hypothetical smile, until the constituent is espied,  his arm taken, \"my dear fellow\" whispered in his ear, and his steps  guided toward the inner precincts--whoever, observing this, has  realized that these are the arts by which men become and remain  legislators, can hardly fail to feel that democracy as it exists is  not an absolutely perfect instrument of government.  It is a painful  fact that the ordinary voter, at any rate in England, is quite blind  to insincerity.  The man who does not care about any definite  political measures can generally be won by corruption or flattery,  open or concealed; the man who is set on securing reforms will  generally prefer an ambitious windbag to a man who desires the public  good without possessing a ready tongue.  And the ambitious windbag, as  soon as he has become a power by the enthusiasm he has aroused, will  sell his influence to the governing clique, sometimes openly,  sometimes by the more subtle method of intentionally failing at a  crisis.  This is part of the normal working of democracy as embodied  in representative institutions.  Yet a cure must be found if democracy  is not to remain a farce.    One of the sources of evil in modern large democracies is the fact  that most of the electorate have no direct or vital interest in most  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#7)"],[1,"this morning, the next Earl of Dorincourt will think  for others as well as for his noble self. He is only a child yet, but I  think he may be trusted.\"    Then his mother went for Cedric and brought him back into the parlor.  Mr. Havisham heard him talking before he entered the room.    \"It's infam-natory rheumatism,\" he was saying, \"and that's a kind of  rheumatism that's dreadful. And he thinks about the rent not being paid,  and Bridget says that makes the inf'ammation worse. And Pat could get a  place in a store if he had some clothes.\"    His little face looked quite anxious when he came in. He was very sorry  for Bridget.    \"Dearest said you wanted me,\" he said to Mr. Havisham. \"I've been  talking to Bridget.\"    Mr. Havisham looked down at him a moment. He felt a little awkward and  undecided. As Cedric's mother had said, he was a very little boy.    \"The Earl of Dorincourt----\" he began, and then he glanced involuntarily  at Mrs. Errol.    Little Lord Fauntleroy's mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put  both her tender arms around his childish body.    \"Ceddie,\" she said, \"the Earl is your grandpapa, your own papa's father.  He is very, very kind, and he loves you and wishes you to love him,  because the sons who were his little boys are dead. He wishes you to be  happy and to make other people happy. He is very rich, and he wishes you  to have everything you would like to have. He told Mr. Havisham so, and  gave him a great deal of money for you. You can give some to Bridget  now; enough to pay her rent and buy Michael everything. Isn't that fine,  Ceddie? Isn't he good?\" And she kissed the child on his round cheek,  where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement.    He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham.    \"Can I have it now?\" he cried. \"Can I give it to her this minute? She's  just going.\"    Mr. Havisham handed him the money. It was in fresh, clean greenbacks and  made a neat roll.    Ceddie flew out of the room with it.    \"Bridget!\" they heard him shout, as he tore into the kitchen. \"Bridget,  wait a minute! Here's some money. It's for you, and you can pay the  rent. My grandpapa gave it to me. It's for you and Michael!\"    \"Oh, Master Ceddie!\" cried Bridget, in an awe-stricken voice. \"It's  twinty-foive dollars is here. Where be's the misthress?\"    \"I think I shall have to go and explain it to her,\" Mrs. Errol said.    So she, too, went out of the room and Mr. Havisham was left alone for  a while. He went to the window and stood looking out into the street  reflectively. He was thinking of the old Earl of Dorincourt, sitting  in his great, splendid, gloomy library at the castle, gouty and lonely,  surrounded by grandeur and luxury, but not really loved by any one,  because in all his long life he had never really loved any one but  himself; he had been selfish and self-indulgent and arrogant and  passionate; he had cared so much for the Earl of Dorincourt and his  pleasures that there had been no time for him to think of other people;  all his wealth and power, all the benefits from his noble name and high  rank, had seemed to him to be things only to be used to amuse and give  pleasure to the Earl of Dorincourt; and now that he was an old man, all  this excitement and self-indulgence had only brought him ill health and  irritability and a dislike of the world, which certainly disliked him.  In spite of all his splendor, there was never a more unpopular old  nobleman than the Earl of Dorincourt, and there could scarcely have been  a more lonely one. He could fill his castle with guests if he chose. He  could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties; but he knew that  in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his  frowning old face and sarcastic, biting speeches. He had a cruel tongue  and a bitter nature, and he took pleasure in sneering at people and  making them feel uncomfortable, when he had the power to do so, because  they were sensitive or proud or timid.    Mr. Havisham knew his hard, fierce ways by heart, and he was thinking  of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow, quiet street. And  there rose in his mind, in sharp contrast, the picture of the cheery,  handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair and telling his story of  his friends, Dick and the apple-woman, in his generous, innocent, honest  way. And he thought of the immense income, the beautiful, majestic  estates, the wealth, and power for good or evil, which in the course of  time would lie in the small, chubby hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust  so deep into his pockets.    \"It will make a great difference,\" he said to himself. \"It will make a  great difference.\"    Cedric and his mother came back soon after. Cedric was in high spirits.  He sat down in his own chair, between his mother and the lawyer, and  fell into one of his quaint attitudes, with his hands on his knees. He  was glowing with enjoyment of Bridget's relief and rapture.    \"She cried!\" he said. \"She said she was crying for joy! I never saw any  one cry for joy before. My grandpapa must be a very good man. I didn't  know he was so good a man. It's more--more agreeabler to be an earl than  I thought it was. I'm almost glad--I'm almost QUITE glad I'm going to be  one.\"          III    Cedric's good opinion of the advantages of being an earl increased  greatly during the next week. It seemed almost impossible for him to  realize that there was scarcely anything he might wish to do which he  could not do easily; in fact, I think it may be said that he did  not fully realize it at all. But at least he understood, after a few  conversations with Mr. Havisham, that he could gratify all his nearest  wishes, and he proceeded to gratify them with a simplicity and delight  which caused Mr. Havisham much diversion. In the week before they sailed  for England he did many curious things. The lawyer long after remembered  the morning they went down-town together to pay a visit to Dick, and the  afternoon they so amazed the apple-woman of ancient lineage by stopping  before her stall and telling her she was to have a tent, and a stove,  and a shawl, and a sum of money which seemed to her quite wonderful.    \"For I have to go to England and be a lord,\" explained Cedric,  sweet-temperedly. \"And I shouldn't like to have your bones on my mind  every time it rained. My own bones never hurt, so I think I don't know  how painful a person's bones can be, but I've sympathized with you a  great deal, and I hope you'll be better.\"    \"She's a very good apple-woman,\" he said to Mr. Havisham, as they walked  away, leaving the proprietress of the stall almost gasping for breath,  and not at all believing in her great fortune. \"Once, when I fell  down and cut my knee, she gave me an apple for nothing. I've always  remembered her for it. You know you always remember people who are kind  to you.\"    It had never occurred to his honest, simple little mind that there were  people who could forget kindnesses.    The interview with Dick was quite exciting. Dick had just been having  a great deal of trouble with Jake, and was in low spirits when they saw  him. His amazement when Cedric calmly announced that they had come to  give him what seemed a very great thing to him, and would set all his  troubles right, almost struck him dumb. Lord Fauntleroy's manner of  announcing the object of his visit was very simple and unceremonious.  Mr. Havisham was much impressed by its directness as he stood by and  listened. The statement that his old friend had become a lord, and was  in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough, caused Dick to  so open his eyes and mouth, and start, that his cap fell off. When he  picked it up, he uttered a rather singular exclamation. Mr. Havisham  thought it singular, but Cedric had heard it before.    \"I soy!\" he said, \"what're yer givin' us?\" This plainly embarrassed his  lordship a little, but he bore himself bravely.    \"Everybody thinks it not true at first,\" he said. \"Mr. Hobbs thought  I'd had a sunstroke. I didn't think I was going to like it myself, but I  like it better now I'm used to it. The one who is the Earl now, he's my  grandpapa; and he wants me to do anything I like. He's very kind, if  he IS an earl; and he sent me a lot of money by Mr. Havisham, and I've  brought some to you to buy Jake out.\"    And the end of the matter was that Dick actually bought Jake out, and  found himself the possessor of the business and some new brushes and a  most astonishing sign and outfit. He could not believe in his good luck  any more easily than the apple-woman of ancient lineage could believe  in hers; he walked about like a boot-black in a dream; he stared at  his young benefactor and felt as if he might wake up at any moment. He  scarcely seemed to realize anything until Cedric put out his hand to  shake hands with him before going away.    \"Well, good-bye,\" he said; and though he tried to speak steadily, there  was a little tremble in his voice and he winked his big brown eyes.  \"And I hope trade'll be good. I'm sorry I'm going away to leave you, but  perhaps I shall come back again when I'm an earl. And I wish you'd write  to me, because we were always good friends. And if you write to me,  here's where you must send your letter.\" And he gave him a slip of  paper. \"And my name isn't Cedric Errol any more; it's Lord Fauntleroy  and--and good-bye, Dick.\"    Dick winked his eyes also, and yet they looked rather moist about the  lashes. He was not an educated boot-black, and he would have found it  difficult to tell what he felt just then if he had tried; perhaps that  was why he didn't try, and only winked his eyes and swallowed a lump in  his throat.    \"I wish ye wasn't goin' away,\" he said in a husky voice. Then he winked  his eyes again. Then he looked at Mr. Havisham, and touched his cap.  \"Thanky, sir, fur bringin' him down here an' fur wot ye've done,  He's--he's a"]]]
