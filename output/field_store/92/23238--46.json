DIO. O ay, but he didn't teach _that_, I opine,    To Pantacles; when he was leading the show I couldn't imagine what he         was at,    He had fastened his helm on the top of his head, he was trying to         fasten his plume upon that.      AESCH. But others, many and brave, he taught, of whom was Lamachus,         hero true;    And thence my spirit the impress took, and many a lion-heart chief I         drew,    Parocluses, Teucers, illustrious names; for I fain the citizen-folk         would spur    To stretch themselves to _their_ measure and height, when-ever the         trumpet of war they hear.    But Phaedras and Stheneboeas? No! no harlotry business deformed my         plays.    And none can say that ever I drew a love sick woman in all my days.      EUR. For _you_ no lot or portion had got in Queen Aphrodite.      AESCH. Thank Heaven for that.    But ever on you and yours, my friend, the mighty goddess mightily sat;    Yourself she cast to the ground at last.      DIO. O ay, that came uncommonly pat.    You showed how cuckolds are made, and lo, you were struck yourself by         the very same fate.      EUR. But say, you cross-grained censor of mine, how _my_ Stheneboeas    could harm the state.      AESCH. Full many a noble dame, the wife of a noble citizen, hemlock         took,    And died, unable the shame and sin of your Bellerophonscenes to brook.      EUR. Was then, I wonder, the tale I told of Phaedra's passionate love    untrue?      AESCH. Not so: but tales of incestuous vice the sacred poet should hide         from view,    Nor ever exhibit and blazon forth on the public stage to the public         ken.    For boys a teacher at school is found, but we, the poets, are teachers         of men.    We are BOUND things honest and pure to speak.      EUR. And to speak great Lycabettuses, pray,    And massive blocks of Parnassian rocks, is _that_ things honest and         pure to say?    In human fashion we ought to speak.      AESCH. Alas, poor witling, and can't you see    That for mighty thoughts and heroic aims, the words themselves         must appropriate be?    And grander belike on the ear should strike the speech of heroes and         godlike powers,    Since even the robes that invest their limbs are statelier, grander         robes than ours.    Such was _my_ plan: but when _you_ began, you spoilt and degraded it         all.      EUR. How so?      AESCH. Your kings in tatters and rags you dressed, and brought them on,         a beggarly show,    To move, forsooth, our pity and ruth.      EUR. And what was the harm, I should like to know.      AESCH. No more will a wealthy citizen now equip for the state a galley    of war. He wraps his limbs in tatters and rags, and whines _he is poor,    too poor by far_.      DIO. But under his rags he is wearing a vest, as woolly and soft as a         man could wish.    Let him gull the state, and he's off to the mart; an eager, extravagant         buyer of fish.      AESCH. Moreover to prate, to harangue, to debate, is now the ambition         of all in the state.    Each exercise-ground is in consequence found deserted and empty: to         evil repute    Your lessons have brought our youngsters, and taught our sailors to         challenge, discuss, and refute    The orders they get from their captains and yet, when _I_ was alive,         I protest that the knaves    Knew nothing at all, save for rations' to call, and to sing \"Rhyppapae\"         as they pulled through the waves.      DIO. And bedad to let fly from their sterns in the eye of the fellow         who tugged at the undermost oar,    And a jolly young messmate with filth to besmirch, and to land for a         filching adventure ashore; But now they harangue, and dispute, and         won't row, And idly and aimlessly float to and fro.      AESCH. Of what ills is he NOT the creator and cause?    Consider the scandalous scenes that he draws,    His bawds, and his panders, his women who give         Give birth in the sacredest shrine,    Whilst others with brothers are wedded and bedded,         And others opine    That \"not to be living\" is truly \"to live.\"    And therefore our city is swarming to-day    With clerks and with demagogue-monkeys, who play    Their jackanape tricks at all times, in all places,    Deluding the people of Athens; but none    Has training enough in athletics to run         With the torch in his hand at the races.      DIO. By the Powers, you are right! At the Panathenaea    I laughed till I felt like a potsherd to see a    Pale, paunchy young gentleman pounding along,    With his head butting forward, the last of the throng,    In the direst of straits; and behold at the gates,    The Ceramites flapped him, and smacked him, and slapped him,    In the ribs, and the loin, and the flank, and the groin,    And still, as they spanked him, he puffed and he panted,    Till at one mighty cuff, he discharged such a puff         That he blew out his torch and levanted.          CHOR. Dread the battle, and stout the combat, mighty and manifold         looms the war.      Hard to decide in the fight they're waging,      One like a stormy tempest raging,      One alert in the rally and skirmish, clever to parry and foin and         spar.         Nay but don't be content to sit      Always in one position only: many the fields for your keen-edged wit.      On then, wrangle in every way,      Argue, battle, be flayed and flay,      Old and new from your stores display,      Yea, and strive with venturesome daring something subtle and neat to         say.        Fear ye this, that to-day's spectators lack the grace of artistic         lore,      Lack the knowledge they need for taking      All the points ye will soon be making?      Fear it not: the alarm is groundless: that, be sure, is the case no         more.      All have fought the campaign ere this:      Each a book of the words is holding; never a single point they'll         miss.         Bright their natures, and now, I ween,         Newly whetted, and sharp, and keen.         Dread not any defect of wit,    Battle away without misgiving, sure that the audience, at least, are         fit.      EUR. Well then I'll turn me to your prologues now,    Beginning first to test the first beginning    Of this fine poet's plays. Why he's obscure    Even in the enunciation of the facts.      DIO. Which of them will you test?      EUR. Many: but first give as that famous one from the Oresteia.      DIO. St! Silence all! Now, Aeschylus, begin.      AESCH. _Grave Hermes, witnessing a father's power. Be thou my saviour    and mine aid to-day, For here I come and hither I return._      DIO. Any fault there?      EUR. A dozen faults and more.      DIO. Eh! why the lines are only three in all.      EUR. But every one contains a score of faults.      DIO. Now Aeschylus, keep silent; if you don't    You won't get off with three iambic lines.      AESCH. Silent for _him_!      DIO. If _my_ advice you'll take.      EUR. Why, at first starting here's a fault sky high.      AESCH. (_To Dio_.) You see your folly.      DIO. Have your way; I care not.      AESCH. (_To Eur_.) What is my fault?      EUR. Begin the lines again.      AESCH. _Grave Hermes, witnessing a father's power_--      EUR. And this beside his murdered father's grave Orestes speaks?      AESCH. I say not otherwise.      EUR. Then does he mean that when his father fell    By craft and violence at a woman's hand,    The god of craft was witnessing the deed?      AESCH. It was not he: it was the Helper Hermes    He called the grave: and this he showed by adding    It was his sire's prerogative he held.      EUR. Why this is worse than all. If from his father    He held this office grave, why then--      DIO. He was A graveyard rifler on his father's side.      AESCH. Bacchus, the wine you drink is stale and fusty.      DIO. Give him another: (_to Eur_.) you, look out for faults.      AESCH. _Be thou my saviour and mine aid to-day, For here I come, and    hither I return_.      EUR. The same thing twice says clever Aeschylus.      DIO. How twice?      EUR. Why, just consider: I'll explain. \"I come,\" says he; and \"I    return,\" says he: It's the same thing, to \"come\" and to \"return.\"      DIO. Aye, just as if you said, \"Good fellow, lend me    A kneading trough: likewise, a trough to knead in.\"      AESCH. It is not so, you everlasting talker,    They're not the same, the words are right enough.      DIO. How so? inform me how you use the words.      AESCH. A man, not banished from his home, may \"come\"    To any land, with no especial chance.    A home-bound exile both \"returns\" and \"comes.\"      DIO. O good, by Apollo! What do you say, Euripides, to that?      EUR. I say Orestes never did \"return.\" He came in secret: nobody    recalled him.      DIO. O good, by Hermes! (_Aside_.) I've not the least suspicion what he    means.      EUR. Repeat another line.      DIO. Ay, Aeschylus, Repeat one instantly: _you_, mark what's wrong.      AESCH. _Now on this funeral mound I call my father To hear, to    hearken._      EUR. There he is again. To \"hear,\" to \"hearken\"; the same thing,    exactly.      DIO. Aye, but he's speaking to the dead, you knave,    Who cannot hear us though we call them thrice.      AESCH. And how do you make _your_ prologues?      EUR. You shall hear; And if you find one single thing said twice,    Or any useless padding, spit upon me.      DIO. Well, fire away: I'm all agog to hear    Your very accurate and faultless prologues.      EUR. _A happy man was Oedipus at first_--      AESCH. Not so, by Zeus; a most unhappy man.    Who, not yet born nor yet conceived, Apollo    Foretold would be his father's murderer.    How could he be a happy man at first.

And he said, If I find  there forty and five, I will not destroy it.    01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there  shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's  sake.    01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I  will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said,  I will not do it, if I find thirty there.    01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto  the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I  will not destroy it for twenty's sake.    01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak  yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I  will not destroy it for ten's sake.    01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing  with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.    01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in  the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he  bowed himself with his face toward the ground;    01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into  your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye  shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we  will abide in the street all night.    01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto  him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake  unleavened bread, and they did eat.    01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men  of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people  from every quarter:    01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the  men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we  may know them.    01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door  after him,    01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.    01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man;  let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is  good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came  they under the shadow of my roof.    01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one  fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we  deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the  man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.    01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the  house to them, and shut to the door.    01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house  with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to  find the door.    01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in  law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the  city, bring them out of this place:    01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is  waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to  destroy it.    01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which  married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the  LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his  sons in law.    01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,  saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;  lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.    01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and  upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the  LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him  without the city.    01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,  that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay  thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.    01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:    01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and  thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving  my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me,  and I die:    01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a  little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my  soul shall live.    01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning  this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou  hast spoken.    01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till  thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.    01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.    01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone  and fire from the LORD out of heaven;    01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the  inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.    01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a  pillar of salt.    01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he  stood before the LORD:    01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the  land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up  as the smoke of a furnace.    01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the  plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the  overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.    01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and  his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt  in a cave, he and his two daughters.    01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,  and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner  of all the earth:    01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with  him, that we may preserve seed of our father.    01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the  firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when  she lay down, nor when she arose.    01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said  unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make  him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that  we may preserve seed of our father.    01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and  the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay  down, nor when she arose.    01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their  father.    01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the  same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.    01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name  Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.    01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,  and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.    01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and  Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.    01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to  him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast  taken; for she is a man's wife.    01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt  thou slay also a righteous nation?    01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she  herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and  innocency of my hands have I done this.    01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst  this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from  sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.    01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,  and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou"]]]
