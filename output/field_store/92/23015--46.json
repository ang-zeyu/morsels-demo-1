[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#7)"],[1," set there with a purpose all too plain and  horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A  great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition  and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but  professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent  obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his  private safe.    It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and  it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the  society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He  thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and  fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to  be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to  speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and  sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that  house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its  inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to  communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined  himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would  sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very  silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his  mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these  reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of  his visits.    48)                              INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW    IT chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk  with Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again through the  by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both  stopped to gaze on it.    \"Well,\" said Enfield, \"that story's at an end at least. We shall  never see more of Mr. Hyde.\"    \"I hope not,\" said Utterson. \"Did I ever tell you that I once saw  him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?\"    \"It was impossible to do the one without the other,\" returned  Enfield. \"And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me,  not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll's! It was  partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did.\"    \"So you found it out, did you?\" said Utterson. \"But if that be  so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To  tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even  outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him  good.\"    49)    The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature  twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright  with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way  open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an  infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner,  Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.    \"What! Jekyll!\" he cried. \"I trust you are better.\"    \"I am very low, Utterson,\" replied the doctor, drearily, \"very  low. It will not last long, thank God.\"    \"You stay too much indoors,\" said the lawyer. \"You should be out,  whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my  cousin--Mr. Enfield--Dr. Jekyll.) Come, now; get your hat and  take a quick turn with us.\"    \"You are very good,\" sighed the other. \"I should like to very  much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But  indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a  great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place  is really not fit.\"    \"Why then,\" said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \"the best thing we  can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we  are.\"    \"That is just what I was about to venture to propose,\" returned  the doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered,  before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded    50)    by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the  very blood of the two gentlemen below. They saw it but for a  glimpse, for the window was instantly thrust down; but that  glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court  without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street;  and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring  thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some  stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at  his companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering  horror in their eyes.    \"God forgive us, God forgive us,\" said Mr. Utterson.    But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked on  once more in silence.    51)                                     THE LAST NIGHT    MR. UTTERSON was sitting by his fireside one evening after  dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.    \"Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?\" he cried; and then  taking a second look at him, \"What ails you?\" he added; \"is the  doctor ill?\"    \"Mr. Utterson,\" said the man, \"there is something wrong.\"      \"Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\" said the  lawyer. \"Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\"    \"You know the doctor's ways, sir,\" replied Poole, \"and how he  shuts himself up. Well, he's shut up again in the cabinet; and I  don't like it, sir--I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson,  sir, I'm afraid.\"    \"Now, my good man,\" said the lawyer, \"be explicit. What are you  afraid of?\"    \"I've been afraid for about a week,\" returned Poole, doggedly  disregarding the question, \"and I can bear it no more.\"    The man's appearance amply bore out his    52)    words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the  moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once  looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he sat with the glass of  wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of  the floor. \"I can bear it no more,\" he repeated.    \"Come,\" said the lawyer, \"I see you have some good reason, Poole;  I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it  is.\"    \"I think there's been foul play,\" said Poole, hoarsely.      \"Foul play!\" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather  inclined to be irritated in consequence. \"What foul play? What  does the man mean?\"    \"I daren't say, sir,\" was the answer; \"but will you come along  with me and see for yourself?\"    Mr. Utterson's only answer was to rise and get his hat and  great-coat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the  relief that appeared upon the butler's face, and perhaps with no  less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to  follow.    It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon,  lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and a flying  wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made  talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed  to have swept the    53)    streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson  thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He  could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been  conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his  fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in  upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square,  when they got there, was all full of wind and dust, and the thin  trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing.  Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled  up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting  weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red  pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these  were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the  moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and  his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.    \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"here we are, and God grant there be  nothing wrong.\"    \"Amen, Poole,\" said the lawyer.    Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door  was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, \"Is that  you, Poole?\"    \"It's all right,\" said Poole. \"Open the door.\" The hall, when  they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built  high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and    54)    women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight  of Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering;  and the cook, crying out, \"Bless God! it's Mr. Utterson,\" ran  forward as if to take him in her arms.    \"What, what? Are you all here?\" said the lawyer peevishly. \"Very  irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.\"    \"They're all afraid,\" said Poole.    Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted  up her voice and now wept loudly.    \"Hold your tongue!\" Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent  that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the  girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had  all started and turned toward the inner door with faces of  dreadful expectation. \"And now,\" continued the butler, addressing  the knife-boy, \"reach me a candle, and we'll get this through  hands at once.\" And then he begged Mr. Utterson to follow him,  and led the way to the back-garden.    \"Now, sir,\" said he, \"you come as gently as you can. I want you  to hear, and I don't want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if  by any chance he was to ask you in, don't go.\"    Mr. Utterson's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a  jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he re-collected  his courage    55)    and followed the butler into the laboratory building and through  the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to  the foot of the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one  side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and  making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the  steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize  of the cabinet door.    \"Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\" he called; and even as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#7)"],[1,"in my inside pocket now.  But the pulling of them  apart and pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.\"    \"Let's see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly.    The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny  piglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around  and nibbled the tender blades.    \"They're hungry, too,\" he said.    \"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and petting  it.    \"Be careful!\" said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you're squeezing me!\"    \"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment.  \"They can actually talk!\"    \"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice.  \"I'm  awfully hungry.\"    \"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question!  It  would be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"    \"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at  the kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"    \"I'm not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning.  \"I'm just hungry.\"    \"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\"  declared the  little man, in a stern voice.  \"They are the only things I have to  prove I'm a wizard.\"    \"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy.  \"I never saw  such small pigs before.\"    \"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where  everything is small because it's a small island.  A sailor brought them  to Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"    \"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of  Dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face.  \"There are no cows here  to give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers.  And if I can't eat  the piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"    \"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these  brooks.  Do you like fish?\"    \"Fish!\" cried the kitten.  \"Do I like fish?  Why, they're better than  piglets--or even milk!\"    \"Then I'll try to catch you some,\" said he.    \"But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?\" asked the  kitten.    \"I think not.  Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist  as the vegetables themselves.  There is no reason, that I can see, why  they may not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"    Then the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string  from his pocket for a fish-line.  The only bait he could find was a  bright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool  if anything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the  blossom.  Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby  brook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was  caught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure  enough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore, where  it began to flop around in great excitement.    The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully  cut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it  closely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in  a few moments it had entirely disappeared.    \"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"    \"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as  it washed its face after the meal.  \"But I don't think that fish had  any bones, because I didn't feel them scratch my throat.\"    \"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.    \"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.    The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with  frightened eyes.    \"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.    \"I'm glad we are not fishes!\" said another.    \"Don't worry,\"  Dorothy murmured, soothingly,  \"I'll not let the kitten  hurt you.\"    Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were  one or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train,  and she went to the buggy and brought them.  Eureka stuck up her nose  at such food, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of  the crackers and ate them up in a jiffy.    \"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard.  \"That is, if  Jim has had enough of the pink grass.\"    The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.    \"I've tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it's  likely to be a long while between meals in this strange country.  But  I'm ready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"    So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,  where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the  buggy and Jim started back to the town.    \"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.    \"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied  the Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he  would keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess  won't know but that we belong there.\"    They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim  drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.    \"It doesn't look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at the  bare room.  \"But it's a place to stay, anyhow.\"    \"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some  openings that appeared near the top of the dome.    \"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to  get to them.\"    \"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard.  \"Let us  walk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"    With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and  Dorothy and Zeb followed him.  It was the same sort of climb one  experiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath  when they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be  doorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house.  Following  these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and  some were furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs.  But there  were no beds at all.    \"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.    \"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied.  \"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we  came, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"    \"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard.  \"But it is a long time since I have  had any sleep, and I'm tired.  So I think I shall lie down upon one of  these hard glass benches and take a nap.\"    \"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the  hall.    Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself  free, rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with  Eureka nestling comfortably beside his big, boney body.  Then the boy  returned to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the  glass bench was soon deep in slumberland.          6.  The Mangaboos Prove Dangerous      When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the  Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival.  The little man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and  looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up  on his bench and yawning.  So the Wizard went in to him.    \"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange  country, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell.  But in  the basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me.  I wish  you would go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene  oil that is under the seat.  There is nothing else that I care about.\"    So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had  returned Dorothy was awake.  Then the three held a counsel to decide  what they should do next, but could think of no way to better their  condition.    \"I don't like these veg'table people,\" said the little girl.  \"They're  cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"    \"I agree with you.  It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"  remarked the Wizard.    \"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even  themselves,\" declared the boy.    \"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;  \"but I don't care much for her, after all.  If there was any other  place to go, I'd like to go there.\"    \"But IS there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.    \"I don't know,\" she answered.    Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to  them, and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the  Princess and a throng of her people had entered the House of the  Sorcerer.    So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to  them:    \"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we  have decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and  must not remain here.\"    \"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the  answer.    \"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"  said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies  to make themselves grow bigger.  The animals you have with you we will  drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit.  Then our country  will be rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"    \"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of  those growing is yet ripe enough to pick.  I am greater than any  thorn-covered sorcerer that every grew in your garden.  Why destroy me?\"    \"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am  informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to  take the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him  to be planted.  Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to  perform.  Then I will decide whether to destroy you with"]]]
