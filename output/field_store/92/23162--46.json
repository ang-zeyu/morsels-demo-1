"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6340"],[0,"Literary Lapses (#7)"],[1,"s, although commonly recommended, may rightly be  condemned as too drastic a remedy. The use of boots  reaching to the knee, to be removed only at night, will  afford immediate relief. In connection with Contractio  is often found--    II. Inflatio Genu, or Bagging of the Knees of the Trousers,  a disease whose symptoms are similar to those above. The  patient shows an aversion to the standing posture, and,  in acute cases, if the patient be compelled to stand,  the head is bent and the eye fixed with painful rigidity  upon the projecting blade formed at the knee of the  trousers.    In both of the above diseases anything that can be done  to free the mind of the patient from a morbid sense of  his infirmity will do much to improve the general tone  of the system.    III. Oases, or Patches, are liable to break out anywhere  on the trousers, and range in degree of gravity from  those of a trifling nature to those of a fatal character.  The most distressing cases are those where the patch  assumes a different colour from that of the trousers  (dissimilitas coloris). In this instance the mind of the  patient is found to be in a sadly aberrated condition.  A speedy improvement may, however, be effected by cheerful  society, books, flowers, and, above all, by a complete  change.    IV. The overcoat is attacked by no serious disorders,  except--    Phosphorescentia, or Glistening, a malady which indeed  may often be observed to affect the whole system. It is  caused by decay of tissue from old age and is generally  aggravated by repeated brushing. A peculiar feature of  the complaint is the lack of veracity on the part of the  patient in reference to the cause of his uneasiness.  Another invariable symptom is his aversion to outdoor  exercise; under various pretexts, which it is the duty  of his medical adviser firmly to combat, he will avoid  even a gentle walk in the streets.    V. Of the waistcoat science recognizes but one disease--    Porriggia, an affliction caused by repeated spilling of  porridge. It is generally harmless, chiefly owing to the  mental indifference of the patient. It can be successfully  treated by repeated fomentations of benzine.    VI. Mortificatio Tilis, or Greenness of the Hat, is a  disease often found in connection with Phosphorescentia  (mentioned above), and characterized by the same aversion  to outdoor life.    VII. Sterilitas, or Loss of Fur, is another disease of  the hat, especially prevalent in winter. It is not  accurately known whether this is caused by a falling out  of the fur or by a cessation of growth. In all diseases  of the hat the mind of the patient is greatly depressed  and his countenance stamped with the deepest gloom. He  is particularly sensitive in regard to questions as to  the previous history of the hat.    Want of space precludes the mention of minor diseases,  such as--    VIII. Odditus Soccorum, or oddness of the socks, a thing  in itself trifling, but of an alarming nature if met in  combination with Contractio Pantalunae. Cases are found  where the patient, possibly on the public platform or at  a social gathering, is seized with a consciousness of  the malady so suddenly as to render medical assistance  futile.       SURGICAL CASES    It is impossible to mention more than a few of the most  typical cases of diseases of this sort.    I. Explosio, or Loss of Buttons, is the commonest malady  demanding surgical treatment. It consists of a succession  of minor fractures, possibly internal, which at first  excite no alarm. A vague sense of uneasiness is presently  felt, which often leads the patient to seek relief in  the string habit--a habit which, if unduly indulged in,  may assume the proportions of a ruling passion. The use  of sealing-wax, while admirable as a temporary remedy  for Explosio, should never be allowed to gain a permanent  hold upon the system. There is no doubt that a persistent  indulgence in the string habit, or the constant use of  sealing-wax, will result in--    II. Fractura Suspendorum, or Snapping of the Braces,  which amounts to a general collapse of the system. The  patient is usually seized with a severe attack of explosio,  followed by a sudden sinking feeling and sense of loss.  A sound constitution may rally from the shock, but a  system undermined by the string habit invariably succumbs.    III. Sectura Pantalunae, or Ripping of the Trousers, is  generally caused by sitting upon warm beeswax or leaning  against a hook. In the case of the very young it is not  unfrequently accompanied by a distressing suppuration of  the shirt. This, however, is not remarked in adults. The  malady is rather mental than bodily, the mind of the  patient being racked by a keen sense of indignity and a  feeling of unworthiness. The only treatment is immediate  isolation, with a careful stitching of the affected part.    In conclusion, it may be stated that at the first symptom  of disease the patient should not hesitate to put himself  in the hands of a professional tailor. In so brief a  compass as the present article the discussion has of  necessity been rather suggestive than exhaustive. Much  yet remains to be done, and the subject opens wide to  the inquiring eye. The writer will, however, feel amply  satisfied if this brief outline may help to direct the  attention of medical men to what is yet an unexplored  field.          The Poet Answered    Dear sir:    In answer to your repeated questions and requests which  have appeared for some years past in the columns of the  rural press, I beg to submit the following solutions of  your chief difficulties:--    Topic I.--You frequently ask, where are the friends of  your childhood, and urge that they shall be brought back  to you. As far as I am able to learn, those of your  friends who are not in jail are still right there in your  native village. You point out that they were wont to  share your gambols. If so, you are certainly entitled to  have theirs now.    Topic II.--You have taken occasion to say:       \"Give me not silk, nor rich attire,      Nor gold, nor jewels rare.\"    But, my dear fellow, this is preposterous. Why, these  are the very things I had bought for you. If you won't  take any of these, I shall have to give you factory cotton  and cordwood.    Topic III.--You also ask, \"How fares my love across the  sea?\" Intermediate, I presume. She would hardly travel  steerage.    Topic IV.--\"Why was I born? Why should I breathe?\" Here  I quite agree with you. I don't think you ought to breathe.    Topic V.--You demand that I shall show you the man whose  soul is dead and then mark him. I am awfully sorry; the  man was around here all day yesterday, and if I had only  known I could easily have marked him so that we could  pick him out again.    Topic VI.--I notice that you frequently say, \"Oh, for  the sky of your native land.\" Oh, for it, by all means,  if you wish. But remember that you already owe for a  great deal.    Topic VII.--On more than one occasion you wish to be  informed, \"What boots it, that you idly dream?\" Nothing  boots it at present--a fact, sir, which ought to afford  you the highest gratification.          The Force of Statistics    They were sitting on a seat of the car, immediately in  front of me. I was consequently able to hear all that  they were saying. They were evidently strangers who had  dropped into a conversation. They both had the air of  men who considered themselves profoundly interesting as  minds. It was plain that each laboured under the impression  that he was a ripe thinker.    One had just been reading a book which lay in his lap.    \"I've been reading some very interesting statistics,\" he  was saying to the other thinker.    \"Ah, statistics\" said the other; \"wonderful things, sir,  statistics; very fond of them myself.\"    \"I find, for instance,\" the first man went on, \"that a  drop of water is filled with little...with little...I  forget just what you call them...little--er--things,  every cubic inch containing--er--containing...let me  see...\"    \"Say a million,\" said the other thinker, encouragingly.    \"Yes, a million, or possibly a billion...but at any  rate, ever so many of them.\"    \"Is it possible?\" said the other. \"But really, you know  there are wonderful things in the world. Now, coal...take  coal...\"    \"Very, good,\" said his friend, \"let us take coal,\" settling  back in his seat with the air of an intellect about to  feed itself.    \"Do you know that every ton of coal burnt in an engine  will drag a train of cars as long as...I forget the  exact length, but say a train of cars of such and such  a length, and weighing, say so much...from...from...hum!  for the moment the exact distance escapes me...drag it  from...\"    \"From here to the moon,\" suggested the other.    \"Ah, very likely; yes, from here to the moon. Wonderful,  isn't it?\"    \"But the most stupendous calculation of all, sir, is in  regard to the distance from the earth to the sun.  Positively, sir, a cannon-ball--er--fired at the sun...\"    \"Fired at the sun,\" nodded the other, approvingly, as if  he had often seen it done.    \"And travelling at the rate of...of...\"    \"Of three cents a mile,\" hinted the listener.    \"No, no, you misunderstand me,--but travelling at a fearful  rate, simply fearful, sir, would take a hundred million--no,  a hundred billion--in short would take a scandalously long  time in getting there--\"    At this point I could stand no more. I interrupted--\"Provided  it were fired from Philadelphia,\" I said, and passed into the  smoking-car.          Men Who have Shaved Me    A barber is by nature and inclination a sport. He can  tell you at what exact hour the ball game of the day is  to begin, can foretell its issue without losing a stroke  of the razor, and can explain the points of inferiority  of all the players, as compared with better men that he  has personally seen elsewhere, with the nicety of a  professional. He can do all this, and then"]]]
