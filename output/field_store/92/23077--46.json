He sold matches, newspapers, and lottery tickets,--three branches  of industry which, if intelligently pursued, might certainly be  productive of honest gain. And so it happened that Pacorrito was  never in want of a penny or so to assist a friend in need, or to  treat his acquaintances of the fair sex.    He was spared all domestic worries, all household cares and  exigencies. His palaces were the Prado in summer, and the portals of  the _Casa Panader√≠a_ in winter. By nature he was frugal and wisely  inimical to the pomps of the world. He slept anywhere, ate whatever  he found, just as the birds do, and suffered no anxiety on this  score, because of the religious submissiveness that filled his soul,  and his instinctive faith in that mysterious Providence which deserts  no one, great or small. One might be apt to conclude from this that  Migajas was happy. It seems natural enough that he should be. He  was deprived of relatives, it is true, but he enjoyed the precious  boon of liberty. As his wants were few, the fruit of his labor kept  him in plenty, and he was not indebted to any one for anything. His  sleep was disturbed neither by cares nor ambition. He was poor but  contented; his body was destitute, but his spirit was rich in peace.  Well, in spite of all this, my lord Pacorrito was unhappy. Why?  Because he was in love,--over ears in love, as they commonly say.    Yes, sir, this very Pacorrito, who was so small, so ugly, so poor,  and so alone, loved. Inexorable law of life, which permits no being,  whatever his condition, to elude the despotic yoke of love! With  a mind free from impure thoughts, our hero loved. He loved with a  dreamer's idealism, yet at times he felt that ardent fire which set  the blood boiling like the very devil in his veins. The object of his  thoughts aroused every variety of sensation in his volcanic heart. He  had days of sweet Platonicism, like Petrarch, then again, he was warm  and impetuous, like Romeo. And who, pray, had inspired Pacorrito  with this terrible passion? No less a person than a great lady who  wore silk and velvet gowns, beautiful furs and gold eyeglasses,--a  great lady with flaxen ringlets that fell on her alabaster neck, and  who had been known to sit at the piano for three days in succession.      III.    Who was this celestial beauty, and how came Migajas to make her  acquaintance? This is how it happened: Our hero's mercantile  operations extended over a great part of one of the streets opening  into the Puerta del Sol,--a busy thoroughfare lined with beautiful  shops, the show-windows of which are resplendent at night, and  display all the marvels of industry. One of these stores, which is  kept by a German, is always full of exquisite trifles and novelties.  It is the great bazaar of childhood, both juvenile and adult. During  the Carnival it is hung with grotesque masks; in Holy Week it is  filled with figures of saints and pious images. At Christmas and New  Year's it is all Bethlehem mangers and Christmas-trees, laden with  toys and magnificent presents.    Pacorrito's mad passion began when the German filled his show-window  with the most enchanting collection of richly dressed ladies that  Parisian fancy could conceive. Almost all of them were two feet tall.  Their faces were of highly refined wax, and the crimson of fresh  roses could not equal the glow of their chaste cheeks. Their immobile  eyes of blue glass shone with a splendor surpassing that of the  human pupil. Their hair of softest crimped wool could with greater  justice be compared to the rays of the sun than that of most great  ladies; and the strawberries of April, the cherries of May, and the  coral from the deep seas were ugly things compared to their lips.  Their good breeding and deportment were such that they never stirred  from the spot where they were placed. They merely creaked the wooden  joints of their knees, their shoulders, and their elbows, when the  German sat them at the piano or made them raise their eyeglasses to  look out into the street. Otherwise they were no trouble whatever,  and no one had ever heard them say, \"This month is mine.\"    There was one among them,--what a woman! She was the tallest, the  most lithe, the most beautiful, the most sympathetic, the most  elegant,--in a word, the greatest lady of them all. She was no doubt  a person of high degree, judging from her grave, grand manner and  that patronizing air which was so becoming to her.    \"Grand woman! She is the paragon!\" thought Pacorrito the first time  he saw her, and for a whole hour he stood before the show-window,  rooted to the sidewalk.      IV.    Pacorrito had reached the state of emotional excitement, the delirium  peculiar to heroes of romance. His brain boiled; writhing, stinging  serpents wound themselves around his heart; his mind was a volcano;  he despised life; he longed for death; he soliloquized; he gazed  at the moon; he soared beyond the seventh heaven. Many a time had  night overtaken him in a melancholy ecstasy before the show-window,  oblivious to everything, oblivious to his very business interests.  It might be well to state at once that our good Migajas met with  no rebuff. I mean that his mad passion was to a certain extent  reciprocated. Who can measure the intensity of a heart of tow and  sawdust? The world is full of mysteries. Science is vain and will  never penetrate the depths of things. Who will draw the line defining  the exact sphere of the inanimate? Where does the inanimate begin?  Down with the pedant who stands before a stone or a cork and says,  \"Thou hast no soul.\" God alone knows the true dimensions of the  invisible limbo, wherein rests all that which does not love.    Pacorrito was quite sure of having stirred his lady's pulse. She  gazed at him, and without moving a muscle, opening her mouth, or  winking an eye, she spoke soulful things to him, now sweet as  hope, now sad like the prescience of tragic events. This naturally  fanned the flame that burned in our friend's heart, and his daring  imagination conceived dramatic plans of conquest, and even of  matrimony.    One night the faithful lover repaired punctually to the tryst. The  lady was seated at the piano, her hands suspended over the keys,  and her divine face turned to the street. The ragamuffin and she  exchanged glances; and what passion, what idealism, in that look!  Sighs and tender thoughts were following one another, when an event  occurred which clipped the thread of this sweet communion and  shattered at one blow the happiness of both lovers. It was one of  those sudden catastrophes that inflict a mortal wound and lead to  suicides, tragedies, and other lamentable things.    A hand proceeding from the interior of the shop was thrust into the  show-window; it caught the lady by the belt and disappeared with her  within. Pacorrito's amazement was followed by a sense of misery so  intense that he longed to die there and then. To see the object of  his love vanish as though she had been swallowed by the insatiable  grave, to be unable to rescue her or follow her, were it to the  bottomless pit, ah, here was a blow which was beyond human endurance!    Migajas was about to drop on the sidewalk. He thought of suicide; he  invoked God and the Devil.    \"They have sold her!\" he muttered hoarsely; and he pulled his hair  and scratched his face and kicked, and as he did so he dropped his  matches, his lottery tickets, and his newspapers. Worldly interests,  you are not worth a sigh!      V.    After a time, when he had recovered from his violent emotion, he  glanced toward the interior of the store and saw two or three grown  persons and several little girls talking with the German. One of  these little girls held in her arms the lady of his thoughts. He felt  like rushing upon them frantically, but he forbore, for it occurred  to him that his appearance was not in his favor, and that there would  be every chance of his getting a sound drubbing and being handed over  to the police. He stood rooted to the threshold, meditating upon the  horrors of the slave-trade, upon this heinous Tyrolese institution  wherein a few dollars decided the fate of honest creatures, exposing  them to the savage destructiveness of ill-bred children. Human nature  appeared to him in all its baseness. Those who had purchased the lady  left the shop and entered a luxurious carriage. And how they laughed,  the wretches! Even the wee fellow, the most petted and spoiled of  them all, no doubt, took the liberty of pulling the unfortunate  doll by the arms, although he had the greatest quantity of toys  appropriate to his age and for his own exclusive enjoyment. The grown  persons, too, seemed satisfied with the new acquisition.    While the footman stood by to receive orders, Pacorrito, who was  a person of heroic and daring resolutions, conceived the idea of  swinging behind the carriage. This he did with that agility peculiar  to the ragamuffin when he wishes to take a ride across the city.    Stretching his neck to the right, he saw the arm of the lady who had  been sacrificed to lucre sticking out of the window. This rigid arm  and its pink fist spoke forcibly to his imagination, calling to him  through the rumble of the wheels:    \"Save me, save me, my Pacorrito!\"      VI.    Under the archway of the great dwelling before which the carriage  stopped, Pacorrito's illusion vanished. A servant informed him that  if he soiled the flagstones with his muddy feet, he would have his  back-bone broken. Migajas retired before this overwhelming argument,  but from that instant his heart was filled with a scorching thirst  for vengeance. His fiery nature impelled him forward into the night  of the unforeseen, into the arms of his fortune. His soul was well  fitted to noisy and dramatic adventures, so what should he do but  make a compact with those who removed the garbage from the house"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#7)"],[1," most  heartily.    Recovering my self-possession, I said, \"I have been most anxious to  apologise for encouraging your mistake the other evening, and came to  A---- in the vague hope of discovering you for that purpose; but since  Colonel Vernon is, I see, acquainted with the affair, he will, I am  certain, admit the temptation was irresistible.\"    \"Faith I do, boy! but there was no mistake at all.\"    \"How?\" I asked, again plunged in bewilderment.    \"Speak for yourself, Miss Kate,\" said the old gentleman.    \"Indeed, Captain Egerton,\" began Kate with a bright blush and merry  laugh, \"I scarce know how to excuse my escapade; first you must know  it was rather a sudden thought of my kind chaperons to go to the  ball, and, knowing no one, we merely meant to look at the proceedings  and return. We were standing near a pillar, and I was thinking how  I would like to dance, when my attention was attracted by some one  exclaiming, rather loudly, 'I have it; I'll pretend to recognise an  acquaintance;--profound deference; get up a little conversation, eh?'  I could not help smiling at the scheme, and, wishing to witness its  _d√©nouement_, you may imagine my surprise, when a few minutes after  you addressed me. I knew your voice; and, as you spoke, it glanced  across my mind that it would be pleasant to dance, and better still  to punish you with your own device by pretending to remember you. I  was fully satisfied, for though a little nervous at first, I soon  gathered confidence from your frequent confusion. How I wish, dear  grandpapa, you could have heard our conversation; I do not think I ever  was more amused; but, Captain Egerton, you certainly played your part  with infinite tact, and sometimes, grandpapa, whenever he grew too  much at his ease, I used to throw him into confusion by some question  or allusion that utterly puzzled him.\" Then turning to me, \"You must  promise to forgive, and not think me very wild, but the temptation to  retaliate was irresistible!\"    \"Forgive you, oh! Miss Vernon; what an uncalled for request; it is I  that should pray for forgiveness for my presumption; I deserved a great  deal more severity, and while I must compliment you for your inimitable  acting, thank you for your forbearance and the delightful hour I passed  in your society.\"    \"Oh! I had the game in my own hands; it was you who played your part  well.\"    \"We are, then, quite reconciled I hope,\" said I.    \"Perfectly,\" she replied, \"but how did grandpapa find you out?\"    Vernon explained; \"I spoke warmly of the happy days I spent with him in  Ireland.\"    \"Dear Dungar!\" said Miss Vernon softly, with her eyes bent down; she  sat silent for a few moments, then, looking up with something that  glistened like a tear, she looked at me steadily, and said, \"Then I do  remember Captain Egerton; he let me win the race on my pony Midge.\"    \"The same,\" said Colonel Vernon. \"Indeed, I am very glad to see you at  the Priory,\" she continued, in her peculiarly frank manner, so cordial  and so well bred; \"and you are staying here for a few days?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Colonel, \"and will dine with us to-day, will you not  Egerton?\"    I accepted most readily, scarcely believing that my oft reviled luck  was about to make me so ample a return for past disagreeables as  to place me at once on a footing of intimacy with the much-admired  incognita, now incognita no more!          CHAPTER IV.    THE DINNER.      The old Colonel continued for some time to engross the largest share of  the conversation, pouring forth innumerable questions about the various  members of our corps; of whom he appeared to have a remarkably clear  recollection, interspersing his reminiscences with many a well told  anecdote, while I answered his questions, and his granddaughter sat  quite still, apparently lost in thought; her bonnet and shawl thrown  carelessly off, one little hand twisting the ear of the solemn old  dog, who sat upright beside her. The deep blush which had sprung to  her cheek on her first perceiving me, had left a warm tinge behind,  and although I did my best to bestow that profound attention on her  respected progenitor, which is so essential a sign of good breeding, I  could not prevent my eyes from constantly turning to assure myself that  the graceful figure so unconsciously attracting them was real, not a  pleasing dream of fancy.    Suddenly Colonel Vernon ended something he was saying, I do not know  what, with \"you were too young to remember all this, Kate, but I think  you said just now you remembered Captain Egerton.\"    \"No grandpapa,\" with a clear calm look in my face, \"not the slightest  recollection of Captain Egerton; I only remember a very merry and young  gentleman, whom, a long time ago, I used to think not too old for a  playfellow at dear Dungar; but I should never in the least recognise  him; and I had quite forgotten the name till you mentioned it.\"    \"Well, really Miss Vernon, my memory is a little better than yours;  Colonel Vernon will bear me witness, that one of my first enquiries,  this morning, was for yourself.\"    \"Quite true,\" said the old gentleman; \"but I must own, Kate, 'twas  evidently prompted by a most confused recollection.\"    \"_N'importe_,\" said Kate, rising, with one of her bright smiles, \"the  least little bit of recollection, ever so tangled, is precious in my  eyes; and grandpapa, as poor dear Mrs. Winter has scarcely got over  her horror of my conduct the other night, let me calm her nerves by  introducing Captain Egerton to her as a real orthodox acquaintance; I  shall ask my little chaperon and her _caro sposo_ to tea, shall I?\"    She tied on her bonnet and threw her shawl around her without waiting  for an answer; \"come, Cormac; _au revoir_, Captain Egerton,\" and  departed, followed by her canine squire.    \"Yes,\" said Colonel Vernon, \"they are really a very kind pair of  oddities, and Kate has formed the warmest friendship for both. Winter  is a painter of some talent, and a gentleman in the true meaning of the  word, if not exactly in the conventional acceptation of it; and I am  glad to secure such companionship for my dear child, who has but little  to amuse her.\"    Poor Vernon seemed quite to cling to me, and insisted on walking me  round the walls to the cathedral, the castle, &c., scarcely leaving  me time to dress, as the dinner hour approached. I confess it was  with a feeling of delightful excitement I performed my rapid toilet.  It seemed to me that fortune, having satisfied her conscience by her  recent frowns, was now yielding to her natural inclination to \"favour  the brave;\" and ready, in the present sunny tone of my mind, to accept  anything as a happy omen, I looked forward to long bright days, in what  I was pleased to consider a prophetic mood.    I soon found myself coasting the Old Priory, and pausing for a few  moments again, to admire the beautiful and singular little pleasure  ground; looked about for the bell, as there was no knocker, when the  door was opened by the watchful Nelly, who had espied my approach  from some private loop-hole. She received me with a curtsey, the  depth of which was calculated to impress my mind more with a sense  of her own dignified position than any peculiar respect for myself;  under its influence and her guidance, I crossed the little gloomy  hall in a subdued manner, repressing a strong inclination to laugh as  she opened the door, announcing in audible tones, _selon la regle_,  \"The Honourable Mr. Egerton.\" Colonel Vernon was standing by the  window opening on the garden, and through it I could perceive his  granddaughter gathering flowers or some such things. She bowed and  smiled as she perceived me, and a moment after, stepping into the room,  stood waiting until her grandfather had finished his account of our  morning rambles, and arranged some half-blown damask roses in her  dress, which by the way was gathered under a band that marked out her  round and pliant figure to perfection, instead of terminating in an  acute angle, as is the general fashion, why I cannot imagine; a more  unnatural finale could scarcely be invented, although it must be a more  daring spirit than mine that would venture to fix any limit to the  creative genius of millinery; I suppose it is my taste for drawing that  has made me so keen an observer of woman's dress, nor have I ever found  my conclusions thereon false.    Miss Vernon, too, had the good taste to wear a great deal of soft lace,  which set off her round white throat, making it look fairer still; and  yet I have known some women turn from lace to linen, but these usually  presided at Dorcas committees.    \"Yes,\" said Miss Vernon, as her grandfather paused, \"You must be tired.  Do you know Captain Egerton; you seem to have infused new life into  grandpapa, he has not walked so much for months, and yet he is quite  fresh. I hope nurse will let us have dinner soon.\"    \"How did that very dignified person find out I was chronicled in  _Debrett_?\" I asked. \"I was amused and surprised at hearing myself so  solemnly announced.\"    \"Nelly seemed troubled in her mind with some indistinct recollections  of you, and asked me if your brother was not a great lord, but I could  not resolve her doubts, so----\"    \"Yes,\" broke in the Colonel, \"she made the same enquiry of me, and  I told her, her surmises were correct to the best of my belief; she  piques herself on her knowledge of rank and precedence.\"    \"What a relief it must be to her to think there is at last some good to  counterbalance the crying evil of poor Mr. and Mrs Winter's degrading  society: people like nurse are such strange mixtures--she would respect  a gentleman in rags if he had a high-sounding name, and excuse his  unpardonable extravagance--while she utterly despises a man of talent  and respectability, because he earns money instead of wasting it!\"    \"Not a word against my sheet anchor, Nelly,\" exclaimed the Colonel.    \"Oh!"]]]
