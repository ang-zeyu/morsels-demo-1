We  now turn out a sack of flour, complete and ready for use, every little  while. We have an extra handle for the mill, so that in case of accident  to the one now in use, we need not shut down but a few moments. We call  attention to our XXXX Git-there brand of flour. It is the best flour in  the market for making angels' food and other celestial groceries. We fully  warrant it, and will agree that for every sack containing whole kernels of  corn, corncobs, or other foreign substances, not thoroughly pulverized, we  will refund the money already paid, and show the person through our mill.    [Illustration: ANCIENT ROMAN MILLER.]    We would also like to call the attention of farmers and housewives around  Pompeii to our celebrated Dough Squatter. It is purely automatic in its  operation, requiring only two men to work it. With this machine two men  will knead all the bread they can eat and do it easily, feeling thoroughly  refreshed at night. They also avoid that dark maroon taste in the mouth so  common in Pompeii on arising in the morning.    To those who do not feel able to buy one of these machines, we would say  that we have made arrangements for the approaching season, so that those  who wish may bring their dough to our mammoth squatter and get it treated  at our place at the nominal price of two bits per squat. Strangers calling  for their squat or unsquat dough, will have to be identified.    Do not forget the place, Via VIII, near Stabian gate.

Speaking about cowboys, Sam Stewart, known from Montana to Old Mexico as  Broncho Sam, was the chief. He was not a white man, an Indian, a greaser  or a negro, but he had the nose of an Indian warrior, the curly hair of an  African, and the courtesy and equestrian grace of a Spaniard. A wide  reputation as a \"broncho breaker\" gave him his name.    To master an untamed broncho and teach him to lead, to drive and to be  safely-ridden was Sam's mission during the warm weather when he was not  riding the range. His special delight was to break the war-like heart of  the vicious wild pony of the plains and make him the servant of man.    I've seen him mount a hostile \"bucker,\" and, clinching his italic legs  around the body of his adversary, ride him till the blood would burst from  Sam's nostrils and spatter horse and rider like rain. Most everyone knows  what the bucking of the barbarous Western horse means. The wild horse  probably learned it from the antelope, for the latter does it the same  way, i.e., he jumps straight up into the air, at the same instant  curving his back and coming down stiff-legged, with all four of his feet  in a bunch. The concussion is considerable.    I tried it once myself. I partially rode a roan broncho one spring day,  which will always be green in my memory. The day, I mean, not the broncho.    It occupied my entire attention to safely ride the cunning little beast,  and when he began to ride me I put in a minority report against it.    I have passed through an earthquake and an Indian outbreak, but I would  rather ride an earthquake without saddle or bridle than to bestride a  successful broncho eruption. I remember that I wore a large pair of  Mexican spurs, but I forgot them until the saddle turned. Then I  remembered them. Sitting down on them in an impulsive way brought them to  my mind. Then the broncho steed sat down on me, and that gave the spurs an  opportunity to make a more lasting impression on my mind.    To those who observed the charger with the double \"cinch\" across his back  and the saddle in front of him like a big leather corset, sitting at the  same time on my person, there must have been a tinge of amusement; but to  me it was not so frolicsome.    There may be joy in a wild gallop across the boundless plains, in the  crisp morning, on the back of a fleet broncho; but when you return with  your ribs sticking through your vest, and find that your nimble steed has  returned to town two hours ahead of you, there is a tinge of sadness about  it all.    Broncho Sam, however, made a specialty of doing all the riding himself. He  wouldn't enter into any compromise and allow the horse to ride him.    In a reckless moment he offered to bet ten dollars that he could mount and  ride a wild Texas steer. The money was put up. That settled it. Sam never  took water. This was true in a double sense. Well, he climbed the  cross-bar of the corral-gate, and asked the other boys to turn out their  best steer, Marquis of Queensbury rules.    As the steer passed out, Sam slid down and wrapped those parenthetical  legs of his around that high-headed, broad-horned brute, and he rode him  till the fleet-footed animal fell down on the buffalo grass, ran his hot  red tongue out across the blue horizon, shook his tail convulsively,  swelled up sadly and died.    It took Sam four days to walk back.    A ten-dollar bill looks as large to me as the star spangled banner, some  times; but that is an avenue of wealth that had not occurred to me.    I'd rather ride a buzz-saw at two dollars a day and found.    [Illustration: A BRONCO ERUPTION.]          How Evolution Evolves.    The following paper was read by me in a clear, resonant tone of voice,  before the Academy of Science and Pugilism at Erin Prairie, last month,  and as I have been so continually and so earnestly importuned to print it  that life was no longer desirable, I submit it to you for that purpose,  hoping that you will print my name in large caps, with astonishers at the  head of the article, and also in good display type at the close:    Some Features Of Evolution.    No one could possibly, in a brief paper, do the subject of evolution full  justice. It is a matter of great importance to our lost and undone race.  It lies near to every human heart, and exercises a wonderful influence  over our impulses and our ultimate success or failure. When we pause to  consider the opaque and fathomless ignorance of the great masses of our  fellow men on the subject of evolution, it is not surprising that crime is  rather on the increase, and that thousands of our race are annually  filling drunkards' graves, with no other visible means of support, while  multitudes of enlightened human beings are at the same time obtaining a  livelihood by meeting with felons' dooms.    These I would ask in all seriousness and in a tone of voice that would  melt the stoniest heart: \"Why in creation do you do it?\" The time is  rapidly approaching when there will be two or three felons for each doom.  I am sure that within the next fifty years, and perhaps sooner even than  that, instead of handing out these dooms to Tom, Dick and Harry as  formerly, every applicant for a felon's doom will have to pass through a  competitive examination, as he should do.    It will be the same with those who desire to fill drunkards' graves. The  time is almost here when all positions of profit and trust will be  carefully and judiciously handed out, and those who do not fit themselves  for those positions will be left in the lurch, whatever that may be.    It is with this fact glaring me in the face that I have consented to  appear before you to-day and lay bare the whole hypothesis, history, rise  and fall, modifications, anatomy, physiology and geology of evolution. It  is for this that I have poured over such works as Huxley, Herbert Spencer,  Moses in the bulrushes, Anaxagoras, Lucretius and Hoyle. It is for the  purpose of advancing the cause of common humanity and to jerk the rising  generation out of barbarism into the dazzling effulgence of clashing  intellects and fermenting brains that I have sought the works of  Pythagoras, Democritus and Epluribus. Whenever I could find any book that  bore upon the subject of evolution, and could borrow it, I have done so  while others slept.    That is a matter which rarely enters into the minds of those who go easily  and carelessly through life. Even the general superintendent of the  Academy of Science and Pugilism here in Erin Prairie, the hotbed of a free  and untrammeled, robust democracy, does not stop to think of the midnight  and other kinds of oil that I have consumed in order to fill myself full  of information and to soak my porous mind with thought. Even the O'Reilly  College of this place, with its strong mental faculty, has not informed  itself fully relative to the great effort necessary before a lecturer may  speak clearly, accurately and exhaustingly of evolution.    And yet, here in this place, where education is rampant, and the idea is  patted on the back, as I may say; here in Erin Prairie, where progress and  some other sentiments are written on everything; here where I am  addressing you to-night for $2 and feed for my horse, I met a little child  with a bright and cheerful smile, who did not know that evolution  consisted in a progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.    So you see that you never know where ignorance lurks. The hydra-headed  upas tree and bete noir of self-acting progress, is such ignorance as  that, lurking in the very shadow of magnificent educational institutions  and hard words of great cast. Nothing can be more disagreeable to the  scientist than a bete noir. Nothing gives him greater satisfaction than to  chase it up a tree or mash it between two shingles.    For this reason, as I said, it gives me great pleasure to address you on  the subject of evolution, and to go into details in speaking of it. I  could go on for hours as I have been doing, delighting you with the  intricacies and peculiarities of evolution, but I must desist. It would  please me to do so, and you would no doubt remain patiently and listen,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#7)"],[1,"princess,  taking the mantle given him by his brother. With the help of this,  the hero succeeds in punishing the princess by transporting her to  a distant island. But she cheats him again. In the magic mantle she  wishes herself home, leaving him on the island. He happens upon an  apple-tree. He eats some of the fruit, but notices with dismay that  horns have grown from his head. After a time he finds other apples;  and when he has eaten them, the horns disappear, and he regains  his original form. Unrecognized, the youth sets out to sell to the  king's daughter some of the first apples. Without suspecting any evil,  she eats them, and horns appear on her head. No one is able to cure  her. Then the hero appears as a foreign physician at the court of  the king, and makes ready his cure. He gives the princess enough of  the good apple to cause the horns to decrease in size. In this way  he compels her to give him back the stolen articles.    The Tagalog versions of the story differ considerably from this  archetype. No brothers of the hero are mentioned. There is but one  magic object, an inexhaustible purse: hence there is no magic flight  to an island. In none of Aarne's variants do we find blossoms producing  horns which may be removed only by leaves from the same tree, as in our  variant. The tail-producing fruit is found in nine European versions  (five Finnish, two Russian, two Italian), but the fang-producing  blossom is peculiar only to our variant; likewise the \"lemonade from  Paradise\" method of dispensing the extract. In thirty-five of the  Finnish and Russian forms of the story the hero whips the princess  to make her give up the stolen articles, or introduces whipping as  a part of the cure (cf. No. 2). Both Filipino versions end with the  marriage of the hero to the princess, a detail often lacking in the  other versions.    It is impossible to say when or whence this tale reached the  Philippines. The fact that the story does not seem to be widespread  in the Islands suggests that its introduction was recent, while  the separate incidents point to some Finnish or Russian version as  source. The only crystallized elements found in the Philippines are  the poor hero's obtaining a magic purse, his aspiring to the hand  of the princess, her theft of the magic object, and its recovery by  means of horn-producing fruits. The complete story (2) seems to be  more native and less \"manufactured\" than the variant.    Besides Aarne, for a general discussion of this cycle see Cosquin, 1 :  123-132; R. Koehler's notes to Gonzenbach's No. 31, and his variants of  this story in Zeitschrift des Vereins fuer Volkskunde (1896); Von Hahn,  2 : 246-247; Grimm, notes to No. 122, \"Donkey Cabbages\" (in Tales  [ed. Hunt], 2 : 419-423). F. H. Groome's \"The Seer\" (No. 23), a part  of which resembles very closely the literary form of the story in  the Gesta Romanorum (ch. 120), seems to have been overlooked by Aarne.        TALE 3    THE STORY OF CARANCAL.      Narrated by Jose P. Caedo, a Tagalog from Batangas, Batangas.      Once upon a time there lived a couple who had long been married,  but had no child. Every Sunday they went to church and begged God to  give them a son. They even asked the witches in their town why God  would not give them a child. The witches told them that they would  have one after a year, but that when born he would be no longer than  a span. Nevertheless the couple gave thanks.    After a year a son was born to them. He was very small, as the  witches had foretold, but he was stronger than any one would expect  such a small child to be. \"It is strange,\" said a neighbor. \"Why,  he eats more food than his stomach can hold.\" The boy grew larger and  larger, and the amount of food he ate became greater and greater. When  he became four feet tall, his daily requirements were a cavan [9]  of rice and twenty-five pounds of meat and fish. \"I can't imagine  how so small a person can eat so much food,\" said his mother to her  husband. \"He is like a grasshopper: he eats all the time.\"    Carancal, as the boy was called, was very strong and very  kind-hearted. He was the leader of the other boys of the town, for  he could beat all of them in wrestling.    After a few years the family's property had all been sold to buy  food for the boy. Day after day they became poorer and poorer, for  Carancal's father had no other business but fishing. So one day when  Carancal was away playing, the wife said to her husband, \"What shall  we do with Carancal? He will make us as poor as rats. It is better for  us to tell him to go earn his living, for he is old enough to work.\"    \"No, it is a shame to send him off,\" said the father, \"for we asked  God for him. I will take him to the forest and there kill him; and  if the neighbors ask how he died, we will say that an accident befell  him while cutting trees.\"    Early the next morning his father led Carancal to the forest, and they  began to cut down a very big tree. When the tree was about to fall,  Carancal's father ordered the son to stand where the tree inclined;  so that when it fell, Carancal was entirely buried. The father  immediately went home, thinking that his son had surely been killed;  but when he and his wife were talking, Carancal came home with the  big tree on his shoulders.    \"Father, father, why did you leave me alone in the forest?\" said the  obedient boy.    The father could not move or speak, for shame of himself. He only  helped his son unload the heavy burden. The mother could not speak  either, for fear Carancal might suspect their bad intentions toward  him. Accordingly she and her husband planned another scheme.    The next day Carancal was invited by his father to go fishing. They  rowed and rowed until they were far out into the blue sea. Then they  put their net into the water. \"Carancal, dive down and see that our  net is sound,\" said the father. Carancal obeyed. In about a minute the  water became red and began to foam. This made the old man think that  his son had been devoured by a big fish, so he rowed homeward. When he  reached home, his wife anxiously asked if Carancal was dead; and the  husband said, \"Yes.\" They then cooked their meal and began to eat. But  their supper was not half finished when Carancal came in, carrying a  big alligator. He again asked his father why he had left him alone  to bring such a big load. The father said, \"I thought you had been  killed by a large fish.\" Carancal then asked his mother to cook him  a cavan of rice, for he was tired from swimming such a long distance.    The couple were now discouraged; they could not think of any way  by which to get rid of Carancal. At last the impatient woman said,  \"Carancal, you had better go out into the world to see what you can do  toward earning your own living. You know that we are becoming poorer  and poorer.\" . . .    \"Mother,\" interrupted the boy, \"I really did not wish to go away  from you; but, now that you drive me as if I were not your son,  I cannot stay.\" He paused for a moment to wipe the tears from his  cheeks. \"You know that I love you; but you, in turn, hate me. What  shall I do? I am your son, and so I must not disobey you. But before  I depart, father and mother, please give me a bolo, [10] a big bolo,  to protect myself in case of danger.\"    The parents willingly promised that he should have one, and after  two days an enormous bolo five yards long was finished. Carancal took  it, kissed the hands of his parents, [11] and then went away with a  heavy heart.    When he had left his little village behind, he did not know which way  to go. He was like a ship without a rudder. He walked and walked until  he came to a forest, where he met Bugtongpalasan. [12] Carancal asked  him where he was going; and Bugtongpalasan said, \"I am wandering,  but I do not know where to go. I have lost my parents, and they have  left me nothing to inherit.\"    \"Do you want to go with me?\" said Carancal.    \"Yes,\" said Bugtongpalasan.    \"Let us wrestle first, and the loser will carry my bolo,\" said Carancal  as a challenge. They wrestled; and Bugtongpalasan was defeated,  so he had to carry the big bolo.    Then they continued their journey until they met Tunkodbola, [13]  whom Carancal also challenged to a wrestling-match. Tunkodbola laughed  at Carancal, and said, \"Look at this!\" He twisted up a tree near by,  and hurled it out of sight.    \"That is all right. Let us wrestle, and we will see if you can twist  me,\" said Carancal scornfully. So they wrestled. The earth trembled,  trees were uprooted, large stones rolled about; but Tunkodbola was  defeated.    \"Here, take this bolo and carry it!\" said Carancal triumphantly;  and they continued their journey.    When they reached the top of a mountain, they saw a big man. This was  Macabuhalbundok. [14] Carancal challenged him; but Macabuhalbundok  only laughed, and pushed up a hill. As the hill fell, he said, \"Look  at this hill! I gave it only a little push, and it was overthrown.\"    \"Well, I am not a hill,\" said Carancal. \"I can balance myself.\" They  wrestled together, and Carancal was once more the winner.    The four companions now walked on together. They were all wandering  about, not knowing where to go. When they were in the midst of a thick  wood, they became hungry; so Carancal, their captain, ordered one of  them to climb a tall tree and see if any house was nigh. Bugtongpalasan  did so, and he saw a big house near the edge of the forest. They all  went to the house to see if they might not beg some food.    It was a very large house; but all the windows were closed, and  it seemed to be uninhabited. They knocked at the door, but no one  answered. Then they went in, and found a table covered with delicious  food; and as they were almost famished, they lost no time in devouring  what seemed to have been prepared for them. After all had eaten,  three of them went hunting, leaving Bugtongpalasan behind to"]]]
