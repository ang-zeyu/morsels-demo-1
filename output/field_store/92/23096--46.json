But I'll kill him or some of his gang or her before I let him get  her.... This is the situation, old friend.  I've little time to spare.  I face arrest for desertion.  Rojas is in town. I think I was followed  to this hotel.  The priest has betrayed me or has been stopped.  Mercedes is here alone, waiting, absolutely dependent upon me to save  her from--from....  She's the sweetest, loveliest girl!... In a few  moments--sooner or later there'll be hell here!  Dick, are you with me?\"    Dick Gale drew a long, deep breath.  A coldness, a lethargy, an  indifference that had weighed upon him for months had passed out of his  being.  On the instant he could not speak, but his hand closed  powerfully upon his friend's.  Thorne's face changed wonderfully, the  distress, the fear, the appeal all vanishing in a smile of passionate  gratefulness.    Then Dick's gaze, attracted by some slight sound, shot over his  friend's shoulder to see a face at the window--a handsome, bold,  sneering face, with glittering dark eyes that flashed in sinister  intentness.    Dick stiffened in his seat.  Thorne, with sudden clenching of hands,  wheeled toward the window.    \"Rojas!\" he whispered.        II    MERCEDES CASTANEDA    THE dark face vanished.  Dick Gale heard footsteps and the tinkle of  spurs.  He strode to the window, and was in time to see a Mexican  swagger into the front door of the saloon.  Dick had only a glimpse;  but in that he saw a huge black sombrero with a gaudy band, the back of  a short, tight-fitting jacket, a heavy pearl-handled gun swinging with  a fringe of sash, and close-fitting trousers spreading wide at the  bottom.  There were men passing in the street, also several Mexicans  lounging against the hitching-rail at the curb.    \"Did you see him?  Where did he go?\" whispered Thorne, as he joined  Gale.  \"Those Greasers out there with the cartridge belts crossed over  their breasts--they are rebels.\"    \"I think he went into the saloon,\" replied Dick.  \"He had a gun, but  for all I can see the Greasers out there are unarmed.\"    \"Never believe it!  There!  Look, Dick!  That fellow's a guard, though  he seems so unconcerned.  See, he has a short carbine, almost  concealed.... There's another Greaser farther down the path.  I'm  afraid Rojas has the house spotted.\"    \"If we could only be sure.\"    \"I'm sure, Dick.  Let's cross the hall; I want to see how it looks from  the other side of the house.\"    Gale followed Thorne out of the restaurant into the high-ceiled  corridor which evidently divided the hotel, opening into the street and  running back to a patio.  A few dim, yellow lamps flickered. A Mexican  with a blanket round his shoulders stood in the front entrance. Back  toward the patio there were sounds of boots on the stone floor. Shadows  flitted across that end of the corridor.  Thorne entered a huge chamber  which was even more poorly lighted than the hall.  It contained a table  littered with papers, a few high-backed chairs, a couple of couches,  and was evidently a parlor.    \"Mercedes has been meeting me here,\" said Thorne.  \"At this hour she  comes every moment or so to the head of the stairs there, and if I am  here she comes down.  Mostly there are people in this room a little  later.  We go out into the plaza.  It faces the dark side of the house,  and that's the place I must slip out with her if there's any chance at  all to get away.\"    They peered out of the open window.  The plaza was gloomy, and at first  glance apparently deserted.  In a moment, however, Gale made out a  slow-pacing dark form on the path.  Farther down there was another.  No  particular keenness was required to see in these forms a sentinel-like  stealthiness.    Gripping Gale's arm, Thorne pulled back from the window.    \"You saw them,\" he whispered.  \"It's just as I feared.  Rojas has the  place surrounded.  I should have taken Mercedes away.  But I had no  time--no chance!  I'm bound!... There's Mercedes now!  My God!... Dick,  think--think if there's a way to get her out of this trap!\"    Gale turned as his friend went down the room.  In the dim light at the  head of the stairs stood the slim, muffled figure of a woman. When she  saw Thorne she flew noiselessly down the stairway to him. He caught her  in his arms.  Then she spoke softly, brokenly, in a low, swift voice.  It was a mingling of incoherent Spanish and English; but to Gale it was  mellow, deep, unutterably tender, a voice full of joy, fear, passion,  hope, and love.  Upon Gale it had an unaccountable effect.  He found  himself thrilling, wondering.    Thorne led the girl to the center of the room, under the light where  Gale stood.  She had raised a white hand, holding a black-laced  mantilla half aside.  Dick saw a small, dark head, proudly held, an  oval face half hidden, white as a flower, and magnificent black eyes.    Then Thorne spoke.    \"Mercedes--Dick Gale, an old friend--the best friend I ever had.\"    She swept the mantilla back over her head, disclosing a lovely face,  strange and striking to Gale in its pride and fire, its intensity.    \"Senor Gale--ah!  I cannot speak my happiness.  His friend!\"    \"Yes, Mercedes; my friend and yours,\" said Thorne, speaking rapidly.  \"We'll have need of him.  Dear, there's bad news and no time to break  it gently.  The priest did not come.  He must have been detained.  And  listen--be brave, dear Mercedes--Rojas is here!\"    She uttered an inarticulate cry, the poignant terror of which shook  Gale's nerve, and swayed as if she would faint.  Thorne caught her, and  in husky voice importuned her to bear up.    \"My darling!  For God's sake don't faint--don't go to pieces! We'd be  lost!  We've got a chance.  We'll think of something.  Be strong!  Fight!\"    It was plain to Gale that Thorne was distracted.  He scarcely knew what  he was saying.  Pale and shaking, he clasped Mercedes to him. Her  terror had struck him helpless.  It was so intense--it was so full of  horrible certainty of what fate awaited her.    She cried out in Spanish, beseeching him; and as he shook his head, she  changed to English:    \"Senor, my lover, I will be strong--I will fight--I will obey. But  swear by my Virgin, if need be to save me from Rojas--you will kill me!\"    \"Mercedes!  Yes, I'll swear,\" he replied hoarsely.  \"I know--I'd rather  have you dead than-- But don't give up.  Rojas can't be sure of you, or  he wouldn't wait.  He's in there.  He's got his men there--all around  us.  But he hesitates.  A beast like Rojas doesn't stand idle for  nothing.  I tell you we've a chance.  Dick, here, will think of  something.  We'll slip away.  Then he'll take you somewhere.  Only--speak to him--show him you won't weaken. Mercedes, this is more  than love and happiness for us.  It's life or death.\"    She became quiet, and slowly recovered control of herself.    Suddenly she wheeled to face Gale with proud dark eyes, tragic  sweetness of appeal, and exquisite grace.    \"Senor, you are an American.  You cannot know the Spanish blood--the  peon bandit's hate and cruelty.  I wish to die before Rojas's hand  touches me.  If he takes me alive, then the hour, the little day that  my life lasts afterward will be tortured--torture of hell. If I live  two days his brutal men will have me.  If I live three, the dogs of his  camp... Senor, have you a sister whom you love? Help Senor Thorne to  save me.  He is a soldier.  He is bound. He must not betray his honor,  his duty, for me.... Ah, you two splendid Americans--so big, so strong,  so fierce!  What is that little black half-breed slave Rojas to such  men?  Rojas is a coward. Now, let me waste no more precious time.  I am  ready.  I will be brave.\"    She came close to Gale, holding out her white hands, a woman all fire  and soul and passion.  To Gale she was wonderful.  His heart leaped.  As he bent over her hands and kissed them he seemed to feel himself  renewed, remade.    \"Senorita,\" he said, \"I am happy to be your servant.  I can conceive of  no greater pleasure than giving the service you require.\"    \"And what is that?\" inquired Thorne, hurriedly.    \"That of incapacitating Senor Rojas for to-night, and perhaps several  nights to come,\" replied Gale.    \"Dick, what will you do?\" asked Thorne, now in alarm.    \"I'll make a row in that saloon,\" returned Dick, bluntly.  \"I'll start  something.  I'll rush Rojas and his crowd.  I'll--\"    \"Lord, no; you mustn't, Dick--you'll be knifed!\" cried Thorne. He was  in distress, yet his eyes were shining.    \"I'll take a chance.  Maybe I can surprise that slow Greaser bunch and  get away before they know what's happened.... You be ready watching at  the window.  When the row starts those fellows out there in the plaza  will run into the saloon.  Then you slip out, go straight through the  plaza down the street.  It's a dark street, I remember.  I'll catch up  with you before you get far.\"    Thorne gasped, but did not say a word.  Mercedes leaned against him,  her white hands now at her breast, her great eyes watching Gale as he  went out.    In the corridor Gale stopped long enough to pull on a pair of heavy  gloves, to muss his hair, and disarrange his collar.  Then he stepped  into the restaurant, went through, and halted in the door leading into  the saloon.  His five feet eleven inches and one hundred and eighty  pounds were more noticeable there, and it was part of his plan to  attract attention to himself.  No one, however, appeared to notice him.  The pool-players were noisily intent on their game, the same crowd of  motley-robed Mexicans hung over the reeking bar. Gale's roving glance  soon fixed upon the man he took to be Rojas. He recognized the huge,  high-peaked, black sombrero with its ornamented band.  The Mexican's  face was turned aside.  He was in earnest, excited colloquy with a  dozen or more comrades, most of whom were sitting round a table.  They  were listening,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/503"],[0,"The Blue Fairy Book (#7)"],[1,"them might have cut off his head five or six times  a day just to please her, and she would have thought it a mere trifle,  so little did she care? You may imagine how hard-hearted her lovers  thought her; and the Queen, who wished to see her married, did not know  how to persuade her to think of it seriously.    \"Bellissima,\" she said, \"I do wish you would not be so proud. What makes  you despise all these nice kings? I wish you to marry one of them, and  you do not try to please me.\"    \"I am so happy,\" Bellissima answered: \"do leave me in peace, madam. I  don't want to care for anyone.\"    \"But you would be very happy with any of these Princes,\" said the Queen,  \"and I shall be very angry if you fall in love with anyone who is not  worthy of you.\"    But the Princess thought so much of herself that she did not consider  any one of her lovers clever or handsome enough for her; and her mother,  who was getting really angry at her determination not to be married,  began to wish that she had not allowed her to have her own way so much.    At last, not knowing what else to do, she resolved to consult a certain  witch who was called \"The Fairy of the Desert.\" Now this was very  difficult to do, as she was guarded by some terrible lions; but happily  the Queen had heard a long time before that whoever wanted to pass  these lions safely must throw to them a cake made of millet flour,  sugar-candy, and crocodile's eggs. This cake she prepared with her own  hands, and putting it in a little basket, she set out to seek the Fairy.  But as she was not used to walking far, she soon felt very tired and sat  down at the foot of a tree to rest, and presently fell fast asleep. When  she awoke she was dismayed to find her basket empty. The cake was all  gone! and, to make matters worse, at that moment she heard the roaring  of the great lions, who had found out that she was near and were coming  to look for her.    \"What shall I do?\" she cried; \"I shall be eaten up,\" and being too  frightened to run a single step, she began to cry, and leaned against  the tree under which she had been asleep.    Just then she heard some one say: \"H'm, h'm!\"    She looked all round her, and then up the tree, and there she saw a  little tiny man, who was eating oranges.    \"Oh! Queen,\" said he, \"I know you very well, and I know how much afraid  you are of the lions; and you are quite right too, for they have eaten  many other people: and what can you expect, as you have not any cake to  give them?\"    \"I must make up my mind to die,\" said the poor Queen. \"Alas! I should  not care so much if only my dear daughter were married.\"    \"Oh! you have a daughter,\" cried the Yellow Dwarf (who was so called  because he _was_ a dwarf and had such a yellow face, and lived in the  orange tree). \"I'm really glad to hear that, for I've been looking for  a wife all over the world. Now, if you will promise that she shall marry  me, not one of the lions, tigers, or bears shall touch you.\"    The Queen looked at him and was almost as much afraid of his ugly little  face as she had been of the lions before, so that she could not speak a  word.    \"What! you hesitate, madam,\" cried the Dwarf. \"You must be very fond of  being eaten up alive.\"    And, as he spoke, the Queen saw the lions, which were running down a  hill toward them.    Each one had two heads, eight feet, and four rows of teeth, and their  skins were as hard as turtle shells, and were bright red.    At this dreadful sight, the poor Queen, who was trembling like a dove  when it sees a hawk, cried out as loud as she could, \"Oh! dear Mr.  Dwarf, Bellissima shall marry you.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\" said he disdainfully. \"Bellissima is pretty enough, but I  don't particularly want to marry her--you can keep her.\"    \"Oh! noble sir,\" said the Queen in great distress, \"do not refuse her.  She is the most charming Princess in the world.\"    \"Oh! well,\" he replied, \"out of charity I will take her; but be sure and  don't forget that she is mine.\"    As he spoke a little door opened in the trunk of the orange tree, in  rushed the Queen, only just in time, and the door shut with a bang in  the faces of the lions.    The Queen was so confused that at first she did not notice another  little door in the orange tree, but presently it opened and she found  herself in a field of thistles and nettles. It was encircled by a muddy  ditch, and a little further on was a tiny thatched cottage, out of which  came the Yellow Dwarf with a very jaunty air. He wore wooden shoes and  a little yellow coat, and as he had no hair and very long ears he looked  altogether a shocking little object.    \"I am delighted,\" said he to the Queen, \"that, as you are to be my  mother-in-law, you should see the little house in which your Bellissima  will live with me. With these thistles and nettles she can feed a donkey  which she can ride whenever she likes; under this humble roof no  weather can hurt her; she will drink the water of this brook and eat  frogs--which grow very fat about here; and then she will have me always  with her, handsome, agreeable, and gay as you see me now. For if her  shadow stays by her more closely than I do I shall be surprised.\"    The unhappy Queen, seeing all at once what a miserable life her daughter  would have with this Dwarf could not bear the idea, and fell down  insensible without saying a word.    When she revived she found to her great surprise that she was lying in  her own bed at home, and, what was more, that she had on the loveliest  lace night cap that she had ever seen in her life. At first she thought  that all her adventures, the terrible lions, and her promise to the  Yellow Dwarf that he should marry Bellissima, must have been a dream,  but there was the new cap with its beautiful ribbon and lace to remind  her that it was all true, which made her so unhappy that she could  neither eat, drink, nor sleep for thinking of it.    The Princess, who, in spite of her wilfulness, really loved her mother  with all her heart, was much grieved when she saw her looking so sad,  and often asked her what was the matter; but the Queen, who didn't want  her to find out the truth, only said that she was ill, or that one of  her neighbors was threatening to make war against her. Bellissima knew  quite well that something was being hidden from her--and that neither of  these was the real reason of the Queen's uneasiness. So she made up her  mind that she would go and consult the Fairy of the Desert about it,  especially as she had often heard how wise she was, and she thought that  at the same time she might ask her advice as to whether it would be as  well to be married, or not.    So, with great care, she made some of the proper cake to pacify the  lions, and one night went up to her room very early, pretending that  she was going to bed; but instead of that, she wrapped herself in a long  white veil, and went down a secret staircase, and set off all by herself  to find the Witch.    But when she got as far as the same fatal orange tree, and saw it  covered with flowers and fruit, she stopped and began to gather some  of the oranges--and then, putting down her basket, she sat down to eat  them. But when it was time to go on again the basket had disappeared  and, though she looked everywhere, not a trace of it could she find.  The more she hunted for it, the more frightened she got, and at last she  began to cry. Then all at once she saw before her the Yellow Dwarf.    \"What's the matter with you, my pretty one?\" said he. \"What are you  crying about?\"    \"Alas!\" she answered; \"no wonder that I am crying, seeing that I have  lost the basket of cake that was to help me to get safely to the cave of  the Fairy of the Desert.\"    \"And what do you want with her, pretty one?\" said the little monster,  \"for I am a friend of hers, and, for the matter of that, I am quite as  clever as she is.\"    \"The Queen, my mother,\" replied the Princess, \"has lately fallen into  such deep sadness that I fear that she will die; and I am afraid that  perhaps I am the cause of it, for she very much wishes me to be married,  and I must tell you truly that as yet I have not found anyone I consider  worthy to be my husband. So for all these reasons I wished to talk to  the Fairy.\"    \"Do not give yourself any further trouble, Princess,\" answered the  Dwarf. \"I can tell you all you want to know better than she could. The  Queen, your mother, has promised you in marriage----\"    \"Has promised _me!_\" interrupted the Princess. \"Oh! no. I'm sure she has  not. She would have told me if she had. I am too much interested in  the matter for her to promise anything without my consent--you must be  mistaken.\"    \"Beautiful Princess,\" cried the Dwarf suddenly, throwing himself on his  knees before her, \"I flatter myself that you will not be displeased  at her choice when I tell you that it is to _me_ she has promised the  happiness of marrying you.\"    \"You!\" cried Bellissima, starting back. \"My mother wishes me to marry  you! How can you be so silly as to think of such a thing?\"    \"Oh! it isn't that I care much to have that honor,\" cried the Dwarf  angrily; \"but here are the lions coming; they'll eat you up in three  mouthfuls, and there will be an end of you and your pride.\"    And, indeed, at that moment the poor Princess heard their dreadful howls  coming nearer and nearer.    \"What shall I do?\" she cried. \"Must all my happy days come to an end  like this?\"    The malicious Dwarf looked at her and began to laugh spitefully. \"At  least,\" said he, \"you have the satisfaction of dying unmarried. A lovely  Princess like you must surely prefer to die rather than be the wife of a  poor little dwarf like myself.\"    \"Oh, don't be angry with me,\" cried the Princess, clasping her hands.  \"I'd rather marry all the dwarfs in the world than die in this horrible  way.\"    \"Look at me well, Princess, before you give me your word,\" said he. \"I  don't want you to"]]]
