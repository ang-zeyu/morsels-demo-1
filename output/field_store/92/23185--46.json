North-east, for instance is  Ayyuk el Matlai; north-west, Ayyuk el Maghibi. Finally, the Dayrah Jahi is  when the magnetic needle points due north. The Dayrah Farjadi (more common  in these regions), is when the bar is fixed under Farjad, to allow for  variation, which at Berberah is about 4 deg. 50' west.    [5] The curious reader will find in the Herodotus of the Arabs, El  Masudi's \"Meadows of gold and mines of gems,\" a strange tale of the blind  billows and the singing waves of Berberah and Jofuni (Cape Guardafui, the  classical Aromata).    [6] \"Foyst\" and \"buss,\" are the names applied by old travellers to the  half-decked vessels of these seas.    [7] Holcus Sorghum, the common grain of Africa and Arabia: the Somali call  it Hirad; the people of Yemen, Taam.    [8] The Somal being a people of less nervous temperament than the Arabs  and Indians, do not fear the moonlight.    [9] The first name is that of the individual, as the Christian name with  us, the second is that of the father; in the Somali country, as in India,  they are not connected by the Arab \"bin\"--son of.    [10] Abdy is an abbreviation of Abdullah; Abokr, a corruption of Abubekr.  The \"End of Time\" alludes to the prophesied corruption of the Moslem  priesthood in the last epoch of the world.    [11] This peculiarity is not uncommon amongst the Somal; it is considered  by them a sign of warm temperament.    [12] The Moslem should first recite the Farz prayers, or those ordered in  the Koran; secondly, the Sunnat or practice of the Prophet; and thirdly  the Nafilah or Supererogatory. The Ratib or self-imposed task is the last  of all; our Mulla placed it first, because he could chaunt it upon his  mule within hearing of the people.    [13] Two modern poets and wits well known in Yemen.    [14] That is to say, \"we will remove it with the five fingers.\" These are  euphuisms to avoid speaking broadly and openly of that venerable feature,  the beard.    [15] Bab el Mandeb is called as above by Humayd from its astronomical  position. Jebel Mayyum is in Africa, Jebel Zubah or Muayyin, celebrated as  the last resting-place of a great saint, Shaykh Said, is in Arabia.    [16] Ajam properly means all nations not Arab. In Egypt and Central Asia  it is now confined to Persians. On the west of the Red Sea, it is  invariably used to denote the Somali country: thence Bruce draws the Greek  and Latin name of the coast, Azamia, and De Sacy derives the word \"Ajan,\"  which in our maps is applied to the inner regions of the Eastern Horn. So  in Africa, El Sham, which properly means Damascus and Syria, is applied to  El Hejaz.    [17] Adel, according to M. Krapf, derived its name from the Ad Ali, a  tribe of the Afar or Danakil nation, erroneously used by Arab synecdoche  for the whole race. Mr. Johnston (Travels in Southern Abyssinia, ch. 1.)  more correctly derives it from Adule, a city which, as proved by the  monument which bears its name, existed in the days of Ptolemy Euergetes  (B.C. 247-222), had its own dynasty, and boasted of a conqueror who  overcame the Troglodytes, Sabaeans, Homerites, &c., and pushed his  conquests as far as the frontier of Egypt. Mr. Johnston, however,  incorrectly translates Barr el Ajam \"land of fire,\" and seems to confound  Avalites and Adulis.    [18] Bahr el Banatin, the Bay of Tajurrah.    [19] A certain German missionary, well known in this part of the world,  exasperated by the seizure of a few dollars and a claim to the _droit  d'aubaine_, advised the authorities of Aden to threaten the \"combustion\"  of Tajurrah. The measure would have been equally unjust and unwise. A  traveller, even a layman, is bound to put up peaceably with such trifles;  and to threaten \"combustion\" without being prepared to carry out the  threat is the readiest way to secure contempt.    [20] The Kharif in most parts of the Oriental world corresponds with our  autumn. In Eastern Africa it invariably signifies the hot season preceding  the monsoon rains.    [21] The circumstances of Masud's murder were truly African. The slave  caravans from Abyssinia to Tajurrah were usually escorted by the Rer  Guleni, a clan of the great Eesa tribe, and they monopolised the profits  of the road. Summoned to share their gains with their kinsmen generally,  they refused upon which the other clans rose about August, 1854, and cut  off the road. A large caravan was travelling down in two bodies, each of  nearly 300 slaves; the Eesa attacked the first division, carried off the  wives and female slaves, whom they sold for ten dollars a head, and  savagely mutilated upwards of 100 wretched boys. This event caused the  Tajurrah line to be permanently closed. The Rer Guleni in wrath, at once  murdered Masud, a peaceful traveller, because Inna Handun, his Abban or  protector, was of the party who had attacked their proteges: they came  upon him suddenly as he was purchasing some article, and stabbed him in  the back, before he could defend himself.    [22] In Zayla there is not a single coffee-house. The settled Somal care  little for the Arab beverage, and the Bedouins' reasons for avoiding it  are not bad. \"If we drink coffee once,\" say they, \"we shall want it again,  and then where are we to get it?\" The Abyssinian Christians, probably to  distinguish themselves from Moslems, object to coffee as well as to  tobacco. The Gallas, on the other hand, eat it: the powdered bean is mixed  with butter, and on forays a lump about the size of a billiard-ball is  preferred to a substantial meal.    [23] The following genealogical table was given to me by Mohammed  Sharmarkay:--      1. Ishak (ibn Ahmed ibn Abdillah).    2. Gerhajis (his eldest son).    3. Said (the eldest son; Daud being the second).    4. Arrah, (also the eldest; Ili, _i.e._ Ali, being the second).    5. Musa (the third son: the eldest was Ismail; then, in       succession, Ishak, Misa, Mikahil, Gambah, Dandan, &c.)    6. Ibrahim.    7. Fikih (_i.e._ Fakih.)    8. Adan (_i.e._ Adam.)    9. Mohammed.    10. Hamid.    11. Jibril (_i.e._ Jibrail).    12. Ali.    13. Awaz.    14. Salih.    15. Ali.    16. Sharmarkay.    The last is a peculiarly Somali name, meaning \"one who sees no harm.\"--  Shar-ma-arkay.    [24] Not the hereditary chieftainship of the Habr Gerhajis, which belongs  to a particular clan.    [25] The following is a copy of the document:--    \"This Testimonial, together with an Honorary Dress, is presented by the  British Resident at Mocha to Nagoda Shurmakey Ally Sumaulley, in token of  esteem and regard for his humane and gallant conduct at the Port of  Burburra, on the coast of Africa, April 10. 1825, in saving the lives of  Captain William Lingard, chief officer of the Brig Mary Anne, when that  vessel was attacked and plundered by the natives. The said Nagoda is  therefore strongly recommended to the notice and good offices of Europeans  in general, but particularly so to all English gentlemen visiting these  seas.\"    [26] Two spears being the usual number: the difficulty of three or four  would mainly consist in their management during action.    [27] In July, 1855, the Hajj Sharmarkay was deposed by the Turkish Pasha  of Hodaydah, ostensibly for failing to keep some road open, or, according  to others, for assisting to plunder a caravan belonging to the Dankali  tribe. It was reported that he had been made a prisoner, and the Political  Resident at Aden saw the propriety of politely asking the Turkish  authorities to \"be easy\" upon the old man. In consequence of this  representation, he was afterwards allowed, on paying a fine of 3000  dollars, to retire to Aden.    I deeply regret that the Hajj should have lost his government. He has ever  clung to the English party, even in sore temptation. A few years ago, the  late M. Rochet (soi-disant d'Hericourt), French agent at Jeddah, paying  treble its value, bought from Mohammed Sharmarkay, in the absence of the  Hajj, a large stone house, in order to secure a footing at Zayla. The old  man broke off the bargain on his return, knowing how easily an Agency  becomes a Fort, and preferring a considerable loss to the presence of  dangerous friends.    [28] During my residence at Zayla few slaves were imported, owing to the  main road having been closed. In former years the market was abundantly  stocked; the numbers annually shipped to Mocha, Hodaydah, Jeddah, and  Berberah, varied from 600 to 1000. The Hajj received as duty one gold  \"Kirsh,\" or about three fourths of a dollar, per head.    [29] Zayla, called Audal or Auzal by the Somal, is a town about the size  of Suez, built for 3000 or 4000 inhabitants, and containing a dozen large  whitewashed stone houses, and upwards of 200 Arish or thatched huts, each  surrounded by a fence of wattle and matting. The situation is a low and  level spit of sand, which high tides make almost an island. There is no  Harbour: a vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the  landing-place; the open roadstead is exposed to the terrible north wind,  and when gales blow from the west and south, it is almost unapproachable.  Every ebb leaves a sandy flat, extending half a mile seaward from the  town; the reefy anchorage is difficult of entrance after sunset, and the  coralline bottom renders wading painful.    The shape of this once celebrated town is a tolerably regular  parallelogram, of which the long sides run from east to west. The walls,  without guns or embrasures, are built, like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#7)"],[1,"r, which in my  opinion was all that she could desire. She put me away with her hand,  and began to weep.    \"At what? She could not tell me. She was filled with sorrow, with  anguish. Probably her tortured nerves had suggested to her the truth  about the baseness of our relations, but she found no words in which to  say it. I began to question her; she answered that she missed her absent  mother. It seemed to me that she was not telling the truth. I sought to  console her by maintaining silence in regard to her parents. I did not  imagine that she felt herself simply overwhelmed, and that her parents  had nothing to do with her sorrow. She did not listen to me, and I  accused her of caprice. I began to laugh at her gently. She dried her  tears, and began to reproach me, in hard and wounding terms, for my  selfishness and cruelty.    \"I looked at her. Her whole face expressed hatred, and hatred of me. I  cannot describe to you the fright which this sight gave me. 'How? What?'  thought I, 'love is the unity of souls, and here she hates me? Me? Why?  But it is impossible! It is no longer she!'    \"I tried to calm her. I came in conflict with an immovable and cold  hostility, so that, having no time to reflect, I was seized with keen  irritation. We exchanged disagreeable remarks. The impression of this  first quarrel was terrible. I say quarrel, but the term is inexact. It  was the sudden discovery of the abyss that had been dug between us. Love  was exhausted with the satisfaction of sensuality. We stood face to  face in our true light, like two egoists trying to procure the greatest  possible enjoyment, like two individuals trying to mutually exploit each  other.    \"So what I called our quarrel was our actual situation as it appeared  after the satisfaction of sensual desire. I did not realize that this  cold hostility was our normal state, and that this first quarrel would  soon be drowned under a new flood of the intensest sensuality. I thought  that we had disputed with each other, and had become reconciled, and  that it would not happen again. But in this same honeymoon there came a  period of satiety, in which we ceased to be necessary to each other, and  a new quarrel broke out.    \"It became evident that the first was not a matter of chance. 'It was  inevitable,' I thought. This second quarrel stupefied me the more,  because it was based on an extremely unjust cause. It was something like  a question of money,--and never had I haggled on that score; it was even  impossible that I should do so in relation to her. I only remember that,  in answer to some remark that I made, she insinuated that it was my  intention to rule her by means of money, and that it was upon money  that I based my sole right over her. In short, something extraordinarily  stupid and base, which was neither in my character nor in hers.    \"I was beside myself. I accused her of indelicacy. She made the same  accusation against me, and the dispute broke out. In her words, in the  expression of her face, of her eyes, I noticed again the hatred that  had so astonished me before. With a brother, friends, my father, I had  occasionally quarrelled, but never had there been between us this fierce  spite. Some time passed. Our mutual hatred was again concealed beneath  an access of sensual desire, and I again consoled myself with the  reflection that these scenes were reparable faults.    \"But when they were repeated a third and a fourth time, I understood  that they were not simply faults, but a fatality that must happen again.  I was no longer frightened, I was simply astonished that I should be  precisely the one to live so uncomfortably with my wife, and that the  same thing did not happen in other households. I did not know that in  all households the same sudden changes take place, but that all,  like myself, imagine that it is a misfortune exclusively reserved for  themselves alone, which they carefully conceal as shameful, not only to  others, but to themselves, like a bad disease.    \"That was what happened to me. Begun in the early days, it continued and  increased with characteristics of fury that were ever more pronounced.  At the bottom of my soul, from the first weeks, I felt that I was in a  trap, that I had what I did not expect, and that marriage is not a joy,  but a painful trial. Like everybody else, I refused to confess it (I  should not have confessed it even now but for the outcome). Now I am  astonished to think that I did not see my real situation. It was so easy  to perceive it, in view of those quarrels, begun for reasons so trivial  that afterwards one could not recall them.    \"Just as it often happens among gay young people that, in the absence of  jokes, they laugh at their own laughter, so we found no reasons for our  hatred, and we hated each other because hatred was naturally boiling  up in us. More extraordinary still was the absence of causes for  reconciliation.    \"Sometimes words, explanations, or even tears, but sometimes, I  remember, after insulting words, there tacitly followed embraces and  declarations. Abomination! Why is it that I did not then perceive this  baseness?\"        CHAPTER XIII.    \"All of us, men and women, are brought up in these aberrations of  feeling that we call love. I from childhood had prepared myself for this  thing, and I loved, and I loved during all my youth, and I was joyous in  loving. It had been put into my head that it was the noblest and highest  occupation in the world. But when this expected feeling came at last,  and I, a man, abandoned myself to it, the lie was pierced through and  through. Theoretically a lofty love is conceivable; practically it is  an ignoble and degrading thing, which it is equally disgusting to  talk about and to remember. It is not in vain that nature has made  ceremonies, but people pretend that the ignoble and the shameful is  beautiful and lofty.    \"I will tell you brutally and briefly what were the first signs of my  love. I abandoned myself to beastly excesses, not only not ashamed of  them, but proud of them, giving no thought to the intellectual life of  my wife. And not only did I not think of her intellectual life, I did  not even consider her physical life.    \"I was astonished at the origin of our hostility, and yet how clear it  was! This hostility is nothing but a protest of human nature against the  beast that enslaves it. It could not be otherwise. This hatred was the  hatred of accomplices in a crime. Was it not a crime that, this poor  woman having become pregnant in the first month, our liaison should have  continued just the same?    \"You imagine that I am wandering from my story. Not at all. I am always  giving you an account of the events that led to the murder of my wife.  The imbeciles! They think that I killed my wife on the 5th of October.  It was long before that that I immolated her, just as they all kill now.  Understand well that in our society there is an idea shared by all  that woman procures man pleasure (and vice versa, probably, but I know  nothing of that, I only know my own case). Wein, Weiber und Gesang. So  say the poets in their verses: Wine, women, and song!    \"If it were only that! Take all the poetry, the painting, the sculpture,  beginning with Pouschkine's 'Little Feet,' with 'Venus and Phryne,' and  you will see that woman is only a means of enjoyment. That is what she  is at Trouba,* at Gratchevka, and in a court ball-room. And think of  this diabolical trick: if she were a thing without moral value, it might  be said that woman is a fine morsel; but, in the first place, these  knights assure us that they adore woman (they adore her and look upon  her, however, as a means of enjoyment), then all assure us that they  esteem woman. Some give up their seats to her, pick up her handkerchief;  others recognize in her a right to fill all offices, participate in  government, etc., but, in spite of all that, the essential point remains  the same. She is, she remains, an object of sensual desire, and  she knows it. It is slavery, for slavery is nothing else than the  utilization of the labor of some for the enjoyment of others. That  slavery may not exist people must refuse to enjoy the labor of others,  and look upon it as a shameful act and as a sin.         *A suburb of Moscow.    \"Actually, this is what happens. They abolish the external form, they  suppress the formal sales of slaves, and then they imagine and assure  others that slavery is abolished. They are unwilling to see that it  still exists, since people, as before, like to profit by the labor of  others, and think it good and just. This being given, there will always  be found beings stronger or more cunning than others to profit thereby.  The same thing happens in the emancipation of woman. At bottom feminine  servitude consists entirely in her assimilation with a means of  pleasure. They excite woman, they give her all sorts of rights equal to  those of men, but they continue to look upon her as an object of sensual  desire, and thus they bring her up from infancy and in public opinion.    \"She is always the humiliated and corrupt serf, and man remains always  the debauched Master. Yes, to abolish slavery, public opinion must admit  that it is shameful to exploit one's neighbor, and, to make woman free,  public opinion must admit that it is shameful to consider woman as an  instrument of pleasure.    \"The emancipation of woman is not to be effected in the public courts or  in the chamber of deputies, but in the sleeping chamber. Prostitution is  to be combated, not in the houses of ill-fame, but in the family. They  free woman in the public courts and in the chamber of deputies, but she  remains an instrument. Teach her, as she is taught among us, to look  upon herself as such, and she will always remain an inferior being.  Either, with the aid of the rascally doctors, she will try to prevent  conception, and descend, not to the"]]]
