[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#7)"],[1," Singapore is  concerned, the greatest weakness in its defense is not on the Island at  all.\"    \"Not on the Island, sir?\" Dave Dawson echoed. \"I don't think I get you.\"    \"The water supply,\" the senior officer said. \"It comes from Johore  on the mainland side of the Strait, and is piped over the causeway.  Blast Singapore's water supply and the lads on the Island would have a  pretty bad time of it. However, that's neither here nor there for the  moment. Dawson, you asked just a moment ago why didn't some other plane  pick you up before this one. I'll tell you. Because there weren't any  other planes in the air. I recalled all patrols early this morning, and  grounded all planes.\"    The Air Vice Marshal paused for a moment, and although a thousand  questions hovered on the boys' lips, they knew enough to hold their  tongues.    \"It's hard to tell the story,\" Bostworth continued presently with a  frown, \"because there are so many parts of it that we don't know a  thing about. In a nutshell, it's this. Everything we do out here is  known in detail in Berlin, Rome, and Tokio within a few hours. The  blighters couldn't be better informed if we broadcast every move we  make over the radio. They are finding out everything, worse luck. That  was why I was sent out here. To find the leak, or leaks, and plug  'em up. As you both know, the population of Singapore is as mixed in  nationalities as any other spot in the whole world. I'll wager that you  could find a man from every country in the world within the limits of  Singapore. Not only is it a great naval base of England's, it is also  one of the great trading ports of the world. And you can be very sure  that the city, itself, and the waterfront, is a thriving place for  spies, right now more than ever before.\"    The senior officer paused for breath and stared thoughtfully out one of  the portholes. The Catalina was still climbing steadily, but it had  not reached an altitude where it was necessary to reach for the small  portable oxygen kits fitted to the wall.    \"I've been out here almost a week,\" the Air Intelligence officer  suddenly went on, \"and what little I've discovered leads me to believe  that all information about our military preparations is leaving  Singapore by air. No, not radio. I mean by plane. By British plane.\"    \"A dirty rat in the R.A.F., sir?\" Dave gasped as though the very  thought of such a thing were a sacrilege.    \"We've caught the type several times in the past,\" Air Vice Marshal  Bostworth said grimly. \"Yes, to be perfectly frank with you. I've  checked and rechecked the service history of every single member of  Singapore R.A.F. personnel, from the Brass Hats right down to the  lowest grade aircraftsman, but a fine lot of good it's done me. I can't  find a single thing that even begins to look suspicious. Yet I'm sure  there are one or more Axis secret agents out here wearing the R.A.F.  uniform.\"    The senior officer stopped to raise a silencing hand as Dave started to  interrupt.    \"I know that sounds crazy,\" he said. \"I mean, that the spy is in the  R.A.F. out here. But here is my reason for thinking so. Rather, my  reasons for thinking so. I've made a few tests. I've let certain  bits of information become known, and then used a secret gadget  we've perfected that can pick up any kind of radio broadcast on any  wave-length within a radius of two hundred miles. And can do it while  nearby powerful stations are operating. But we didn't hear a single  broadcast of which we didn't know the code and couldn't decipher  easily. I've checked all ship movements, and all movements of troops  going over the causeway. And all civilians, too. However, all the  information I had purposely let slip reached the Berlin Government  in a very short time. That was reported to me by my own agents. So  I was sure all of the information left here by plane. It must have.  But.... But I must confess I didn't even dream they did it the way your  experience seems to prove they do it.\"    \"Then that two hour patrol we were supposed to have made, and did  make?\" Dave said with a puzzled frown. \"You expected us to spot the spy  in his plane tearing off to pass on the information to somebody else?  But maybe we might not have given him a single glance. At least, not a  second glance.\"    Air Vice Marshal Bostworth shook his head and struck a match to fire up  his dead pipe.    \"No, not exactly that,\" he said presently. \"I let out a rather  valuable bit of information concerning coming reenforcements out here,  and then grounded all planes. Used the excuse of general overhaul and  inspection. At the same time I arranged for you chaps to buzz around  over the Strait. First, I wanted to see if our little spy friend would  risk it to fly off with his bit of information in the face of my  grounding order. If he did, we could jolly well radio you chaps his  direction and orders to head him off at all cost. Secondly, if the  blighter didn't try to sneak off ... which he didn't, blast him ... I  wanted you chaps out there to spot any plane of _any_ type that might  attempt to contact you in the air. In other words I was counting on  you chaps to help me get a line on the _other_ plane that I believed  was flying out each day from Japanese controlled Indo-China to contact  their man in our forces. I was hoping for a description of the plane,  what direction it came from, and so forth. I had thought up a little  stunt to pull.... But that's out, now. Our friend isn't contacting  another plane. He is, of course, contacting a submarine. A Jap sub, no  doubt, but I'll wager a thousand pounds it's commanded by a trained  Nazi. So you see, when you didn't show up, and I found you floating on  the water, I thought that you'd had a bit of a go with this supposedly  other plane, and come off second best. Good lord, though, that  submarine was bold as brass to surface and actually blaze away at you!  To me that means they're getting very cocky. And of course I'm speaking  of the Jap johnnies.\"    \"Contacts a Jap tin can, huh, and probably drops his information by  signal buoy?\" Dave murmured more to himself. \"The sub slips on to sea  and radioes the stuff to its nearest base.\"    \"Correct,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said with a curt nod. \"And from  that particular base it is relayed on to Tokio. And from Tokio it goes  to Berlin. And Hitler knows all about the very latest things we've  accomplished out here. And Tokio has another bit of information on what  she'll be up against when she attacks us.\"    \"And she will, you feel sure, sir?\" Freddy Farmer spoke for the first  time in many minutes.    \"Unfortunately, there isn't the slightest doubt of it,\" the Air  Intelligence officer replied. \"Yes, we expect war, rather, we expect an  attack, and very soon. We're getting ready for it just as fast as we  can. However, our forces are not strong, particularly in the air, and  what we've got to find out ... and it'll probably require a miracle to  find it out ... is just where, when, and how the Japs plan to strike.  I don't think it will be by sea. And I don't think it will be by land  down the Malay Peninsula _unless_ they are forced to. I have a feeling  they will attempt a quick knockout by air. That perhaps they'll have a  go at Hongkong and Singapore at the same time. I don't know. If only  I could catch the sly beggar who's getting out all the information, I  could put a plan to work that might get very good results that will tip  the Japs' hand as to just what they will try once they get the go-ahead  word from Berlin. But....\"    The Air Vice Marshal sighed heavily and gave an angry shake of his head.    \"But so long as the leak remains,\" he grated through clenched teeth,  \"we're definitely in the soup. And heaven only knows what may come of  it. We haven't the fighting strength we need to beat off an all out  attack. And I'm very much afraid we're not going to get reenforcements  in time.\"    The Air Vice Marshal fell silent for a few moments, stared unseeing off  into space, and absently tapped the stem of his pipe against his strong  teeth. Eventually he grunted as though he had reached some kind of a  decision, and switched his gaze to the two R.A.F. youths.    \"We've got to find out what the Japs, coached by the Nazis of course,  are planning,\" he said slowly. \"I think there's a way we can do it.  True, it's about one chance in a thousand of succeeding. And.... Well,  the attempt could well possibly cost the lives of a couple of brave  chaps.\"    The Intelligence Officer emphasized the last with a faint gesture of  his hand, and for the next minute or so there was no sound in the  navigation compartment save the muffled roar of the engines outside.  Dave looked at Freddy, caught his grim nod, and turned to the Air Vice  Marshal.    \"Well, I know a couple of fellows who would like to take a crack at it,  sir,\" he said in a quiet, steady voice.          CHAPTER SIX    _The Devil's Den_      The Air Ministry official looked at them, smiled and seemed to let  clamped air out of his lungs.    \"I knew, of course, that you'd say that,\" he said. \"But I was not  exaggerating when I said you might pay for your efforts with your  lives. Strictly speaking, it is not an Air Force job. I mean, there may  or may not be any flying attached to it. The task is very definitely  Intelligence work. Lord knows any one of us Intelligence chaps out here  in the Far East would be only too glad to have a go at it. However,  every British Intelligence Johnnie in these parts is well known to Axis  agents here. Just as we have a pretty good idea who is working against  us ... though we haven't yet laid them all by the heels.\"    The Air Vice Marshal paused and gave an angry shake of his head as  though he were getting himself all mixed up.    \"I'd better tell what little I know,\" he said, \"and perhaps between us  we can fill some of the holes with close guesses. Well, here goes. In  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#7)"],[1," a face that he thought he had seen before,  until he realized the similarity was only the bronze and hard line and  rugged cast common to desert men. The gray searching eyes went right  through him.    \"Glad to see you. Get down and come in. Just heard from an Indian that  you were coming. I'm the trader Withers,\" he said to Shefford. His voice  was welcoming and the grip of his hand made Shefford's ache.    Shefford told his name and said he was as glad as he was lucky to arrive  at Kayenta.    \"Hello! Nas Ta Bega!\" exclaimed Withers. His tone expressed a surprise  his face did not show. \"Did this Indian bring you in?\"    Withers shook hands with the Navajo while Shefford briefly related what  he owed to him. Then Withers looked at Nas Ta Bega and spoke to him in  the Indian tongue.    \"Shadd,\" said Nas Ta Bega. Withers let out a dry little laugh and his  strong hand tugged at his mustache.    \"Who's Shadd?\" asked Shefford.    \"He's a half-breed Ute--bad Indian, outlaw, murderer. He's in with  a gang of outlaws who hide in the San Juan country.... Reckon you're  lucky. How'd you come to be there in the Sagi alone?\"    \"I traveled from Red Lake. Presbrey, the trader there, advised against  it, but I came anyway.\"    \"Well.\" Withers's gray glance was kind, if it did express the  foolhardiness of Shefford's act. \"Come into the house.... Never mind the  horse. My wife will sure be glad to see you.\"    Withers led Shefford by the first stone house, which evidently was the  trading-store, into the second. The room Shefford entered was large,  with logs smoldering in a huge open fireplace, blankets covering every  foot of floor space, and Indian baskets and silver ornaments everywhere,  and strange Indian designs painted upon the whitewashed walls. Withers  called his wife and made her acquainted with Shefford. She was a slight,  comely little woman, with keen, earnest, dark eyes. She seemed to be  serious and quiet, but she made Shefford feel at home immediately. He  refused, however, to accept the room offered him, saying that he me  meant to sleep out under the open sky. Withers laughed at this and said  he understood. Shefford, remembering Presbrey's hunger for news of the  outside world, told this trader and his wife all he could think of; and  he was listened to with that close attention a traveler always gained in  the remote places.    \"Sure am glad you rode in,\" said Withers, for the fourth time. \"Now you  make yourself at home. Stay here--come over to the store--do what you  like. I've got to work. To-night we'll talk.\"    Shefford went out with his host. The store was as interesting as  Presbrey's, though much smaller and more primitive. It was full of  everything, and smelled strongly of sheep and goats. There was a narrow  aisle between sacks of flour and blankets on one side and a high counter  on the other. Behind this counter Withers stood to wait upon the buying  Indians. They sold blankets and skins and bags of wool, and in exchange  took silver money. Then they lingered and with slow, staid reluctance  bought one thing and then another--flour, sugar, canned goods, coffee,  tobacco, ammunition. The counter was never without two or three Indians  leaning on their dark, silver-braceleted arms. But as they were slow to  sell and buy and go, so were others slow to come in. Their voices were  soft and low and it seemed to Shefford they were whispering. He liked  to hear them and to look at the banded heads, the long, twisted rolls  of black hair tied with white cords, the still dark faces and watchful  eyes, the silver ear-rings, the slender, shapely brown hands, the lean  and sinewy shapes, the corduroys with a belt and gun, and the small,  close-fitting buckskin moccasins buttoned with coins. These Indians  all appeared young, and under the quiet, slow demeanor there was fierce  blood and fire.    By and by two women came in, evidently squaw and daughter. The former  was a huge, stout Indian with a face that was certainly pleasant if not  jolly.    She had the corners of a blanket tied under her chin, and in the folds  behind on her broad back was a naked Indian baby, round and black of  head, brown-skinned, with eyes as bright as beads. When the youngster  caught sight of Shefford he made a startled dive into the sack of the  blanket. Manifestly, however, curiosity got the better of fear, for  presently Shefford caught a pair of wondering dark eyes peeping at him.    \"They're good spenders, but slow,\" said Withers. \"The Navajos are  careful and cautious. That's why they're rich. This squaw, Yan As Pa,  has flocks of sheep and more mustangs than she knows about.\"    \"Mustangs. So that's what you call the ponies?\" replied Shefford.    \"Yep. They're mustangs, and mostly wild as jack-rabbits.\"    Shefford strolled outside and made the acquaintance of Withers's helper,  a Mormon named Whisner. He was a stockily built man past maturity, and  his sun-blistered face and watery eyes told of the open desert. He was  engaged in weighing sacks of wool brought in by the Indians. Near by  stood a framework of poles from which an immense bag was suspended. From  the top of this bag protruded the head and shoulders of an Indian who  appeared to be stamping and packing wool with his feet. He grinned at  the curious Shefford. But Shefford was more interested in the Mormon. So  far as he knew, Whisner was the first man of that creed he had ever met,  and he could scarcely hide his eagerness. Venters's stories had been  of a long-past generation of Mormons, fanatical, ruthless, and  unchangeable. Shefford did not expect to meet Mormons of this kind.  But any man of that religion would have interested him. Besides this,  Whisner seemed to bring him closer to that wild secret canyon he had  come West to find. Shefford was somewhat amazed and discomfited to have  his polite and friendly overtures repulsed. Whisner might have been an  Indian. He was cold, incommunicative, aloof; and there was something  about him that made the sensitive Shefford feel his presence was  resented.    Presently Shefford strolled on to the corral, which was full of shaggy  mustangs. They snorted and kicked at him. He had a half-formed wish that  he would never be called upon to ride one of those wild brutes, and then  he found himself thinking that he would ride one of them, and after a  while any of them. Shefford did not understand himself, but he fought  his natural instinctive reluctance to meet obstacles, peril, suffering.    He traced the white-bordered little stream that made the pool in the  corral, and when he came to where it oozed out of the sand under the  bluff he decided that was not the spring which had made Kayenta famous.  Presently down below the trading-post he saw a trough from which burros  were drinking. Here he found the spring, a deep well of eddying water  walled in by stones, and the overflow made a shallow stream meandering  away between its borders of alkali, like a crust of salt. Shefford  tasted the water. It bit, but it was good.    Shefford had no trouble in making friends with the lazy sleepy-eyed  burros. They let him pull their long ears and rub their noses, but the  mustangs standing around were unapproachable. They had wild eyes; they  raised long ears and looked vicious. He let them alone.    Evidently this trading-post was a great deal busier than Red Lake.  Shefford counted a dozen Indians lounging outside, and there were others  riding away. Big wagons told how the bags of wool were transported out  of the wilds and how supplies were brought in. A wide, hard-packed road  led off to the east, and another, not so clearly defined, wound away to  the north. And Indian trails streaked off in all directions.    Shefford discovered, however, when he had walked off a mile or so across  the valley to lose sight of the post, that the feeling of wildness  and loneliness returned to him. It was a wonderful country. It held  something for him besides the possible rescue of an imprisoned girl from  a wild canyon.    . . . . . . . . . . .    That night after supper, when Withers and Shefford sat alone before  the blazing logs in the huge fireplace, the trader laid his hand on  Shefford's and said, with directness and force:    \"I've lived my life in the desert. I've met many men and have been a  friend to most.... You're no prospector or trader or missionary?\"    \"No,\" replied Shefford.    \"You've had trouble?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Have you come in here to hide? Don't be afraid to tell me. I won't give  you away.\"    \"I didn't come to hide.\"    \"Then no one is after you? You've done no wrong?\"    \"Perhaps I wronged myself, but no one else,\" replied Shefford, steadily.    \"I reckoned so. Well, tell me, or keep your secret--it's all one to me.\"    Shefford felt a desire to unburden himself. This man was strong,  persuasive, kindly. He drew Shefford.    \"You're welcome in Kayenta,\" went on Withers. \"Stay as long as you like.  I take no pay from a white man. If you want work I have it aplenty.\"    \"Thank you. That is good. I need to work. We'll talk of it later. ...  But just yet I can't tell you why I came to Kayenta, what I want to  do, how long I shall stay. My thoughts put in words would seem so  like dreams. Maybe they are dreams. Perhaps I'm only chasing a  phantom--perhaps I'm only hunting the treasure at the foot of the  rainbow.\"    \"Well, this is the country for rainbows,\" laughed Withers. \"In summer  from June to August when it storms we have rainbows that'll make you  think you're in another world. The Navajos have rainbow mountains,  rainbow canyons, rainbow bridges of stone, rainbow trails. It sure is  rainbow country.\"    That deep and mystic chord in Shefford thrilled. Here it was  again--something tangible at the bottom of his dream.    Withers did not wait for Shefford to say any more, and almost as if  he read his visitor's mind he began to talk about the wild country he  called home.    He had lived at"]]]
