Necessarily this delegated authority is one in kind;[5] it is simply  authority given of God to man by which man is authorized to act in  God's stead in relation to certain things; but its powers are grouped  in various ways for the purpose of facilitating the administration  of its government. First, its powers are grouped with reference  to temporal and spiritual affairs; the division of the Priesthood  which has charge more especially of spiritual affairs is called  the Melchisedek Priesthood; that which has charge more especially  of temporal affairs, the Aaronic Priesthood. The officers of the  Melchisedek Priesthood are, Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs, High  Priests, Seventies, Elders; of the Aaronic Priesthood: Bishops (who are  High Priests, ordained to be Bishops and constitute the Presidency of  the Aaronic Priesthood), Priests, Teachers, Deacons.    While this division of the Priesthood, or this grouping of its officers  with reference to spiritual and temporal labors, assigns one to  spiritual and the other to temporal concerns, it must not be thought  that there is anything rigid in said division of labor; that the  Aaronic Priesthood is excluded from participation in spiritual labors;  or that the Melchisedek Priesthood is excluded from dealing with  temporal affairs. The line of demarkation,[6] as a matter of fact, is  crossed by each division; some of the duties of the Aaronic Priesthood  are spiritual, and some of the duties of the Melchisedek, temporal.  This division then rests upon the fact that the duties assigned  the Aaronic priesthood are chiefly temporal, and the duties of the  Melchisedek chiefly spiritual.    Another division of the Priesthood may be said to exist within the  Melchisedek Priesthood, which is also a division with reference to its  labors, viz., the foreign ministry and the home ministry, of which more  is to be said later.    2. _The Church._ The Church may be said to arise from the Priesthood.  Comprehensively defined it may be said to be an organization of  people--including all officers and members--who believe in and  endeavor to incorporate in their lives God's Truth; who have obeyed  the ordinances or sacraments appointed of God for salvation and  admission into his Church; whose officers are of divine appointment and  commission, (that is, possessed of divine authority, the Priesthood)  guided by an ever present inspiration from God, and walking within  reach of an ever present and continuous source of immediate revelation.    The Church is the depository of God's revealed truth. Man may be able  by searching to find out many truths. What he has learned by study,  by investigation, aided by the inspiration of the Lord--for \"there  is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them  understanding\"--amounts to very much; but there are some things which  even by searching man may not learn. \"Canst thou by searching find  out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\"[7] The  inference in the scripture is, and the fact is, that the answer must  be, no. God can not be perfectly known, only as he reveals himself to  man; man can know his relationship to God only as God is pleased to  reveal it; man can only know the terms and means of his salvation as  the Lord reveals it; and these revelations, when he has one in the  earth, God gives to his Church; these truths which man by searching,  by his own wisdom, may not find out in their perfection--God deposits  with his Church--hence the Church is the depository of God's revealed  truth--she receives and is the custodian of the Gospel.    And not only is the Church the depository of revealed truth; but she  is also the depository of the divine authority; she, in organized  capacity, holds as content the Holy Priesthood; and she has commission  and agency to dispense the truth and administer through her  instrumentalities all the ordinances of the gospel.    3. _The Mission of the Church:_ The Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints was brought into existence for the accomplishment  of two great things: first, the proclamation of the truth concerning  man's salvation to all the world: and second, the perfecting of those  who accept that truth. The Church is organized with reference to the  accomplishment of these two purposes, and has, for the accomplishment  of those purposes, a foreign ministry and a home ministry. In defining  the duties of a Seventy it is with the foreign ministry that we have to  deal.    4. _The Foreign Ministry._ The business of the foreign ministry is to  make proclamation of the gospel in all the world, and gather, as soon  as wisdom dictates, those who accept it into the organized stakes of  Zion. This foreign ministry, strictly speaking, is composed of the  Twelve Apostles and the quorums of the Seventy.    5. _The Twelve:_ \"The twelve traveling counselors are called to be the  Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the  world; thus differing from other officers in the Church in the duties  of their calling. * * * * The Twelve are a traveling presiding High  Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of  the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven;  to build up the Church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all  nations; first unto the Gentiles, and secondly unto the Jews. * * * *  The Twelve being sent out, holding the keys to open the door by the  proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ--and first unto the Gentiles  and then unto the Jews.\" (Doc & Cov., Sec. cvii.) This is the special  calling of the Twelve Apostles, and the calling of the Seventy is like  unto it.    6. _The Seventy:_ \"The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel,  and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world.  Thus differing from other officers in the Church in the duties of  their calling. * * * * The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord,  under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling High Council, in  building up the Church and regulating all the affairs of the same in  all nations--first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews. * * * * It  is the duty of the traveling High Council to call upon the Seventy,  when they need assistance, to fill the several calls for preaching and  administering the gospel, instead of any others. * * * * And these  Seventy (the reference is to the whole body of that Priesthood) are  to be traveling ministers unto the Gentiles first, and also unto the  Jews. * * * * Whereas other officers of the Church, who belong not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#7)"],[1,"  rolling through the still forest, far and wide; and to the white  explorer who lies in his grass hammock in pitchy darkness,  fighting off the mosquitoes and loneliness, and wondering from  whence tomorrow's meals will come, the moral effect is gruesome  and depressing.    In captivity the youthful howler habitually growls and grumbles in  a way that is highly amusing, and the absurd pitch of the deep  bass voice issuing from so small an animal is cause for wonder.    It is natural that we should look closely to the apes and monkeys  for language, both by voice and sign. In 1891 there was a flood of  talk on \"the speech of monkeys,\" and it was not until about 1904  that the torrent stopped. At first the knowledge that monkeys can  and do communicate to a limited extent by vocal sounds was hailed  as a \"discovery\"; but unfortunately for science, nothing has been  proved beyond the long-known fact that primates of a given species  understand the meaning of the few sounds and cries to which their  kind give utterance.    Thus far I have never succeeded in teaching a chimpanzee or  orangutan to say even as much as \"Oh\" or \"Ah.\" Nothing seems to be  further from the mind of an orang than the idea of a new vocal  utterance as a means to an end.    Our Polly was the most affectionate and demonstrative chimpanzee  that I have ever seen, and her reaction to my voice was the best  that I have found in our many apes. She knew me well, and when I  greeted her in her own language, usually she answered me promptly  and vociferously. Often when she had been busy with her physical-  culture exercises and Delsartean movements on the horizontal bars  or the trapeze in the centre of her big cage, I tested her by  quietly joining the crowd of visitors in the centre of the room  before her cage, and saying to her: \"Polly! Wah! Wah! Wah!\"    Nearly every time she would stop short, give instant attention and  joyously respond \"Wah! Wah! Wah!\", repeating the cry a dozen times  while she clambered down to the lower front bars to reach me with  her hands. When particularly excited she would cry \"_Who_-oo!  _Who_-oo! _Who_-oo!\" with great clearness and vehemence,  the two syllables pitched four notes apart. This cry was uttered  as a joyous greeting, and also at feeding-time, in expectation of  food; but, simple as the task seems to be, I really do not know  how to translate its meaning into English. In one case it appears  to mean \"How do you do?\" and in the other it seems to stand for  \"Hurry up!\"    Polly screamed when angry or grieved, just like a naughty child;  and her face assumed the extreme of screaming-child expression.  She whined plaintively when coaxing, or when only slightly  grieved. With these four manifestations her vocal powers seemed to  stop short. Many times I opened her mouth widely with my fingers,  and tried to surprise her into saying \"Ah,\" but with no result. It  seems almost impossible to stamp the vocal-sound idea upon the  mind of an orang-utan or chimpanzee. Polly uttered two distinct  and clearly cut syllables, and it really seemed as if her vocal  organs could have done more if called upon.    The cries of the monkeys, baboons and lemurs are practically  nothing more than squeals, shrieks or roars. The baboons (several  species, at least) bark or roar most explosively, using the  syllable \"Wah!\" It is only by the most liberal interpretation of  terms that such cries can be called language. The majority express  only two emotions--dissatisfaction and expectation. Every primate  calls for help in the same way that human beings do, by shrill  screaming; but none of them ever cry \"Oh\" or \"Ah.\"    The only members of the monkey tribe who ever spoke to me in their  native forests were the big black langurs of the Animallai Hills  in Southern India. They used to glare down at us, and curse us  horribly whenever we met. Had we been big pythons instead of men  they could not have said \"Confound you!\" any more plainly or more  vehemently than they did.    In those museum-making days our motto was \"All's fish that cometh  to net\"; and we killed monkeys for their skins and skeletons the  same as other animals. My brown-skinned Mulcer hunters said that  the bandarlog hated me because of my white skin. At all events, as  we stalked silently through those forests, half a dozen times a  day we would hear an awful explosion overhead, startling to men  who were still-hunting big game, and from the middle zone of the  tree-tops black and angry faces would peer down at us. They said:  \"Wah! Wah! Wah! Ah-^oo-oo-Aoo-oo-^oo-oo!\" and it was nothing else  than cursing and blackguarding. How those monkeys did hate us! I  never have encountered elsewhere anything like it in monkey-land.  la 1902 there was a startling exhibition of monkey language at  our Primate House. That was before the completion of the Lion House.  We had to find temporary outdoor quarters for the big jaguar,  \"Senor Lopez\"; and there being nothing else available, we decided  to place him, for a few days only, in the big circular cage at the  north end of the range of outside cages. It was May, and the  baboons, red-faced monkeys, rhesus, green and many other of the  monkeys were in their outside quarters.    I was not present when Lopez was turned into the big: cage; but I  heard it. Down through the woods to the polar bears' den, a good  quarter of a mile, came a most awful uproar, made by many voices.  The bulk of it was a medley of raucous yells and screeches, above  which it was easy to distinguish the fierce, dog-like barks and  roars of the baboons.    We knew at once that Lopez had arrived. Hurrying up to the Primate  House, we found the wire fronts of the outside cages literally  plastered with monkeys and baboons, all in the wildest excitement.  The jaguar was in full view of them, and although not one out of  the whole lot, except the sapajous, ever had an ancestor who had  seen a jaguar, one and all recognized a hostile genus, and a  hereditary enemy.    And how they cursed him, reviled him, and made hideous faces at  him! The long-armed yellow baboons barked and roared until they  were heard half a mile away. The ugly-tempered macaques and  rhesus monkeys nearly burst with hatred and indignation. The row  was kept up for a long time, and the monkey language that was lost  to science on that occasion was, both in quantity and quality,  beyond compare.    Bear Language. In their native haunts bears are as little given  to loud talk as other animals; but in roomy and comfortable  captivity, where many are yarded together, they rapidly develop  vocal powers. Our bears are such cheerful citizens, and they do so  many droll things, that the average visitor works overtime in  watching them. I have learned the language of our bears  sufficiently that whenever I hear one of them give tongue I know  what he says. For example:    In warning or threatening an enemy, the sloth bear says: \"Ach!  Ach! Ach!\" and the grizzly says: \"Woof! Woof!\" A fighting bear  says: \"Aw-aw-aw!\" A baby's call for its mother is \"Row! Row!\" A  bear's distress call is: \"Err-_wow_-oo-oo-oof!\"    But even in a zoological park it is not possible for everyone to  recognize and interpret the different cries of bears, although the  ability to do so is sometimes of value to the party of the second  part. For example:    One day in February I was sitting in my old office in the Service  Building, engrossed in I know not what important and solemn  matter. The park was quiet; for the snow lay nine inches deep over  all. There were no visitors, and the maintenance men were  silently shovelling. Over the hill from the bear dens came the  voice of a bear. It said, as plainly as print: \"Err-wow!\" I said  to myself: \"That sounds like a distress call,\" and listened to  hear it repeated.    Again it came: \"Err-wow!\"    I caught up my hat and hastened over the hill toward the bear  dens. On the broad concrete walk, about a hundred feet from the  dens, four men were industriously shovelling snow, unaware that  anything was wrong anywhere except on the pay-roll, opposite their  names.    Guided by the cries that came from \"The Nursery\" den, where six  yearling cubs were kept, I quickly caught sight of the trouble.  One of our park-born brown bear cubs was hanging fast by one  forefoot from the top of the barred partition. He had climbed to  the top of the ironwork, thrust one front paw through between two  of the bars (for bears are the greatest busybodies on earth), and  when he sought to withdraw it, the sharp point of a bar in the  overhang of the tree-guard had buried itself in the back of his  paw, and held him fast. It seemed as if his leg was broken, and  also dislocated at the shoulder. No wonder the poor little chap  squalled for help. His mother, on the other side of the partition,  was almost frantic with baffled sympathy, for she could do nothing  to help him.    It did not take more than a quarter of a minute to have several  men running for crowbars and other things, and within five minutes  from the discovery we were in the den ready for action. The little  chap gave two or three cries to let us know how badly it hurt his  leg to hang there, then bent his small mind upon rendering us  assistance.    First we lifted him up bodily, and held him, to remove the strain.  Then, by good luck, we had at hand a stout iron bar with a U-  shaped end; and with that under the injured wrist, and a crowbar  to spring the treacherous overhang, we lifted the foot clear, and  lowered little Brownie to the floor. From first to last he helped  us all he could, and seemed to realize that it was clearly \"no  fair\" to bite or scratch. Fortunately the leg was neither broken  nor dislocated, and although Brownie limped for ten days, he soon  was all right again.    After the incident had been closed, I gave the men a brief lecture  on the language of bears, and the necessity of being able to  recognize the"]]]
