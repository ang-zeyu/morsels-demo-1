How much she really meant Merle never knew, but the  latter did not trust her.    \"There's a sneaky look about her eyes,\" she commented to Mavis. \"Sybil  lunges out and finds open fault, but Kitty hits in the dark. I hope she's  not going to spoil Iva!\"    \"Oh, don't say that!\"    \"They're chums already, and Iva is rather a chameleon! She takes the  colour of her character from her friends.\"          CHAPTER IV    Chagmouth Folk      As this book partly concerns the doings of the group of girls who came  daily from Chagmouth to Durracombe, we will follow them as they motored  back on their ten miles' journey from school. Squashed together in 'the  sardine-tin,' as they irreverently nicknamed the highly respectable car  driven by Mr. Vicary, who owned the garage close to the mill, they held  high jinks and talked at least thirteen to the dozen. There was so much  to discuss. The school was new to all of them, and naturally they wished  to criticise its methods, its teachers, its girls, and its prospects of  fun during the ensuing term.    \"I like Miss Mitchell!\"    \"Yes, she's jolly, though I fancy she could be stern.\"    \"Oh, I shouldn't like to face her in the study, of course.\"    \"Miss Fanny is a dear!\"    \"And so is Miss Pollard.\"    \"What d'you think of the monitresses?\"    \"Merle is A1!\"    \"Yes, I'm taken with Mavis and Merle! Partly because they seem to belong  to Chagmouth. They come over nearly every Saturday with Dr. Tremayne.\"    \"Good! Then we shall see something of them. Hello! What's this car trying  to pass us? Babbie Williams! I'd forgotten for the moment she lives at  Chagmouth too.\"    It was Babbie, driving in solitary state, who flew by in the big motor,  which turned up the side road that led to The Warren. She gave a friendly  nod as she passed, and the six 'sardines' smiled in return.    \"It's a case of 'we are seven' from Chagmouth,\" commented Fay. \"If we  include Mavis and Merle that would make nine. I guess we'll get up a set  of nature study rambles on Saturday afternoons and all go out together.  We'd have some real frolics!\"    \"Rather! I'm your girl! Romola and I are ready for any fun that's going.  That's to say if there's going to be time for any fun. But with all the  pile of lessons Miss Mitchell has given us we shall be busy, with our  noses at the grindstone. It always takes both of us hours to do our  prep!\"    The car meanwhile, with Mr. Vicary at the driving-wheel, had run across  the moor and down the steep hill, and was jolting over the cobble-stones  of the narrow main street of Chagmouth. It stopped outside the Post  Office, for the principal reason that if it went any farther it would be  impossible for it to turn round, and the girls, dismounting, took their  satchels or piles of books, said good-bye to one another, and scattered  to their respective homes. Beata and Romola crossed the bridge that  spanned the brook, skirted the harbour, climbed a flight of steps cut in  the solid rock, and reached a house which stood on the top of a high crag  overlooking the sea. It was an ideal spot for an artist to live, and it  was chiefly for its glorious view that Mr. Castleton had chosen it. He  was intensely sensitive to his surroundings, and preferred a picturesque  cottage, however inconvenient, to the comforts of an unaesthetic, bow-  windowed, modern, red-brick, suburban residence.    \"Romance before everything!\" he declared. \"It's impossible to paint  unless you're in the right atmosphere. English scenery is getting spoilt  and vulgarised to such a degree that there'll soon be none of it left to  sketch. Where are the beautiful villages of thirty years ago? Gone--most  of them! The thatched roofs replaced by corrugated iron, and the hedges  clipped close to please the motorists. I defy anybody to make a  successful picture out of a clipped hedge! Even the gnarled apple trees  are being cut down and replaced by market gardeners' 'choice saplings.'  Picturesque England will soon be a thing of the past! I consider  Chagmouth one of the last strongholds for an artist, and I'm going to  live here as long as it remains unspoilt. There's enough work to keep me  busy for several years at any rate.\"    It is part of an artist's business to move about from place to place in  quest of fresh subjects. Mr. Castleton had spent some years at  Porthkeverne, and having, from a professional point of view, exhausted  that neighbourhood, he had transferred himself and his family to a new  horizon. He had a genius for discovering his right niche, and he had been  fortunate enough to light upon exactly the place that appealed to him. It  would not have suited everybody. It was a long low house, made of three  fishermen's cottages thrown into one, built so close to the edge of the  cliff that it seemed like a sea-bird's nest, with windows overlooking the  channel and the harbour, and a strip of stony garden behind. Inside, the  accommodation was somewhat cramped, but the rooms, if small, were quaint,  with an old-fashioned air about the panelled parlour and raftered dining-  room that suggested bygone days of smugglers and privateers. Below, in a  nook of the cliff, stood an old sail-shed, which Mr. Castleton had turned  into his studio. The big new skylight had only just been fitted into the  roof, and the stove which was to heat it during the winter was still at  Durracombe station waiting for the carrier to fetch it, but canvases were  already hung round the walls, the throne was erected and the big easel  placed in position, and an old fisherman, with weather-beaten countenance  and picturesque stained jersey, sat every morning for his portrait.    Those of our readers who have met the Castletons before in _The Head  Girl at the Gables_, will remember that they were a very large family.  Morland, the eldest, had been at the war, had won the D.C.M., and was now  learning engineering; Claudia was studying singing in London; Madox had  been sent for his first term at boarding-school; and the four little  ones, Constable, Lilith, Perugia, and Gabriel, were still in the nursery.  There was only one gap. Landry, poor Landry, who had never been like  other boys, had passed over the divide and joined the beautiful mother  whom in features he had so strongly resembled. A painting of him, as a  little child in her arms, hung on the studio wall. In some respects it  was the most brilliant portrait which Mr. Castleton had ever achieved. He  always showed it to visitors as a specimen of his best work.    At the time this story begins, Beata and Romola were fourteen and  thirteen years of age. They thoroughly maintained the family reputation  for good looks. There was a certain resemblance between them, and yet a  difference. Beata's eyes were clear grey, with dark lines round the iris,  and her hair was the exact shade of one of her father's best English gold  picture frames. She was a clever, capable girl, with a great love for  music, and was beginning to play the violin rather well. She got on quite  tolerably with her stepmother, and was fond of the little half-brothers  and sisters, though the warmest corner of her heart was reserved for  Madox, who was the baby of the elder portion of the family.    Romola, blue-eyed and ethereal, with long amber hair like a Saxon  princess, was her father's favourite model whenever he wished to depict  scenes of olden times. She figured as 'Guinevere' in a series of  illustrations to the _Morte d'Arthur_, as 'Elaine' her portrait had  been exhibited in the Academy, as 'The Lady of Shalott' she had appeared  in a coloured frontispiece of _The Art Review_, she inspired a most  successful poster of 'Cinderella,' and was the original of a series of  fairy drawings in a children's annual. She was not so clever or go-ahead  as Beata, and was rather dreamy and romantic in temperament, with a gift  towards painting and poetry, and a disinclination to do anything very  definite. She left most of the problems of life to Beata, and seldom  troubled to make decisions for herself. She was rather a pet with Violet,  her young stepmother, who, while preferring her to her sister, found her  the less useful of the two.    \"You go, Beata, you're so quick!\" Violet would say, when she wanted an  errand done, and for the same reason gave the charge of the children to  the one who was the more capable of assuming the responsibility.    It was not that Romola consciously shirked home duties, but she would any  time rather pose for an hour on the throne in the studio than take  temporary command of the nursery. Beata, on the contrary, hated sitting  still, and considered there was no greater penance than to be  commandeered by her father as a model. Her energetic temperament liked to  find its expression in outdoor activities. She had set to work upon the  neglected garden, and was busy trying to make flower-beds, and she looked  forward keenly to the forthcoming hockey season at school. The daily  drive to Durracombe and back was pure delight, and formed her greatest  compensation for leaving Porthkeverne and The Gables.    The Haven, as the house occupied by the Castletons was called, had been  changed into its present form by an old retired sea-captain, and there  was much about it that suggested a nautical atmosphere. The panelled  walls of the parlour might have been taken from a ship's cabin, the  dining-room contained convenient lockers, there was a small observatory  upstairs built to accommodate a big telescope, and the figure-head of a  vessel adorned the garden. Young Mrs. Castleton, whose tastes inclined  towards up-to-date comforts, often grumbled at its inconveniences, but on  the whole the family liked it. They would not have exchanged it for a  suburban villa for worlds. Just on the opposite side of the harbour, with  the jetty and the broad strip of green water in between, was the  furnished house rented at present"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#7)"],[1,"love of  neighbor, the condemnation of slavery, the obligation to aid the poor,  humane treatment of the stranger, sympathy and compassion with every  living being--all these lofty injunctions ensue as inevitable  consequences from the principle of equality. Biblical legislation is  perhaps the only example of a political and social code based, not  upon abstract reasoning alone, but also upon the requirements of the  feelings, upon the finest impulses of the human soul. By the side of  formal right and legality, it emphasizes, and, in a series of  precepts, makes tangible, the principle of justice and humanity. The  Mosaic law is a \"propaganda by deed.\" Everywhere it demands active,  more than passive, morality. Herein, in this elevated characteristic,  this vital attribute, consists the chief source of the power of  Mosaism. The same characteristic, to be sure, prevented it from at  once gaining ground in the national life. It established itself only  gradually, after many fluctuations and errors. In the course of the  centuries, and keeping pace with the growth of the national  consciousness, it was cultivated and perfected in detail.    The conquest of Canaan wrought a radical transformation in the life of  the Israelitish people. The acquiring of national territory supplied  firm ground for the development and manifold application of the  principles of Mosaism. At first, however, advance was out of the  question. The mass of the people had not reached the degree of  spiritual maturity requisite for the espousal of principles  constituting an exalted theory of life. It could be understood and  represented only by a thoughtful minority, which consisted chiefly of  Aaronites and Levites, together forming a priestly estate, though not  a hierarchy animated by the isolating spirit of caste that flourished  among all the other peoples of the Orient. The populace discovered  only the ceremonial side of the religion; its kernel was hidden from  their sight. Defective spiritual culture made the people susceptible  to alien influences, to notions more closely akin to its  understanding. Residence in Canaan, among related Semitic tribes that  had long before separated from the Israelites, and adopted altogether  different views and customs, produced a far greater metamorphosis in  the character of the Israelites than the sojourn in Egypt. After the  first flush of victory, when the unity of the Israelitish people had  been weakened by the particularistic efforts of several of the tribes,  the spiritual bonds confining the nation began to relax. Political  decay always brings religious defection in its train. Whenever Israel  came under the dominion of the neighboring tribes, he also fell a  victim to their cult. This phenomenon is throughout characteristic of  the so-called era of the Judges. It is a natural phenomenon readily  explained on psychologic grounds. The Mosaic national conception of  the \"Eternal\" entered more and more deeply into the national  consciousness, and, accommodating itself to the limited mental  capacity of the majority, became narrower and narrower in compass--the  lot of all great ideas! The \"Eternal\" was no longer thought of as the  only One God of the whole universe, but as the tutelar deity of the  Israelitish tribe. The idea of national tutelar deities was at that  time deeply rooted in the consciousness of all the peoples of Western  Asia. Each nation, as it had a king of its own, had a tribal god of  its own. The Phoenicians had their Baal, the Moabites their Kemosh, the  Ammonites their Milkom. Belief in the god peculiar to a nation by no  means excluded belief in the existence of other national gods. A  people worshiped its own god, because it regarded him as its master  and protecting lord. In fact, according to the views then prevalent, a  conflict between two nations was the conflict between two national  deities. In the measure in which respect for the god of the defeated  party waned, waxed the number of worshipers of the god of the  victorious nation, and not merely among the conquerors, but also among  the adherents of other religions.[10] These crude, coarsely  materialistic conceptions of God gained entrance with the masses of  the Israelitish people. If Moab had his Kemosh, and Ammon his Milkom,  then Israel had his \"Eternal,\" who, after the model of all other  national gods, protected and abandoned his \"clients\" at pleasure, in  the one case winning, in the other losing, the devotion of his  partisans. In times of distress, in which the Israelites groaned under  the yoke of the alien, the enslaved \"forgot\" their \"conquered\"  \"Eternal.\" As they paid the tribute due the strange king, and yielded  themselves to his power, so they submitted to the strange god, and  paid him his due tribute of devotion. It followed that liberation from  the yoke of the stranger coincided with return to the God of Israel,  the \"Eternal.\" At such times the national spirit leaped into flaming  life. This sums up the achievements of the hero-Judges. But the traces  of repeated backsliding were deep and long visible, for, together with  the religious ideas of the strange peoples, the Israelites accepted  their customs, as a rule corrupt and noxious customs, in sharp  contrast with the lofty principles of the Mosaic Law, designed to  control social life and the life of the individual.      [10] \"Ye have forsaken me,\" says God unto Israel, \"and served      other gods; wherefore I will deliver you no more. Go and cry      unto the gods which ye have chosen: let them deliver you in      the time of your tribulations\" (Judges X, 13-14). The same      idea is brought out still more forcibly in the arguments      adduced by Jephthah in his message to the king of Ammon (more      correctly, Moab), who had laid claim to Israelitish lands:      \"Thou,\" says Jephthah, \"mayest possess that which Kemosh thy      god giveth thee to possess, but what the Lord our God giveth      us to possess, that will we possess\" (Judges xi, 24). Usually      these words are taken ironically; to me they seem to convey      literal truth rather than irony.    The Prophet Samuel, coming after the unsettled period of the Judges,  had only partial success in purifying the views of the people and  elevating it out of degradation to a higher spiritual level. His work  was continued with more marked results in the brilliant reigns of  Saul, David, and Solomon. An end was put to the baleful disunion among  the tribes, and the bond of national tradition was strengthened. The  consolidated Israelitish kingdom triumphed over its former oppressors.  The gods of the strange peoples cringed in the dust before the  all-powerful \"Eternal.\" But, with the division of the kingdom and the  political rupture between Judah and Israel, the period of  efflorescence soon came to an end. Again confusion reigned supreme,  and customs and convictions deteriorated under foreign influence.  Prophets like Elijah and Elisha, feverish though their activity was,  stood powerless before the rank immorality in the two states. The  northern kingdom of Israel, composed of the Ten Tribes, passed swiftly  downward on the road to destruction, sharing the fate of the  numberless Oriental states whose end was inevitable by reason of inner  decay. The inspired words of the early Israelitish Prophets, Amos,  Hosea, and Micah, their trumpet-toned reproofs, their thrilling  admonitions, died unheeded upon the air--society was too depraved to  understand their import. It was reserved for later generations to give  ear to their immortal utterances, eloquent witnesses to the lofty  heights to which the Jewish spirit was permitted to mount in times of  general decline. The northern kingdom sank into irretrievable ruin.  Then came the turn of Judah. He, too, had disregarded the law of  \"sanctification\" from Sinai, and had nearly arrived at the point of  stifling his better impulses in the morass of materialistic living.    At this critical moment, on the line between to be and not to be, a  miracle came to pass. The spirit of the people, become flesh in its  noblest sons, rose aloft. From out of the midst of the political  disturbances, the frightful infamy, and the moral corruption,  resounded the impressive call of the great Prophets of Judah. Like a  flaming torch carried through dense darkness, they cast a glaring  light upon the vices of society, at the same time illuminating the  path that leads upward to the goal of the ethical ideal. At first the  negative, denouncing element predominated in the exhortations of the  Prophets: unsparingly they scourged the demoralization and the  iniquity, the social injustice and the political errors prevalent in  their time; they threatened divine punishment, that is, the natural  consequences of evil-doing, and appealed to the reason rather than the  feelings of the people. But gradually they elaborated positive ideals,  more soul-stirring than the ideals identified with the old religious  tradition. The Prophets were the first to touch the root of the evil.  It is clear that they realized that alien influences and the low grade  of intelligence possessed by the masses were not the sole causes of  the frequent backsliding of the people. The Jewish doctrine itself  bore within it the germ of error. The two chief pillars of the old  faith--the nationalizing of the God-idea, and the stress laid upon the  cult, the ceremonial side of religion, as compared with moral  requirements--were first and foremost to be held responsible for the  flagrant departures from the spirit of Judaism. This was the direction  in which reform was needed. Thereafter the sermons of the Prophets  betray everywhere the intense desire, on the one hand, to restore to  the God-idea its original universal character, and, on the other hand,  while strongly emphasizing the importance of morality in the religious  and the social sphere, to derogate from the value"]]]
