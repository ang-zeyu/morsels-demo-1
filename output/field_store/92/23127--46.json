This circumstance, which was deeply lamented by his parents and tutors,  was in fact, in the best opinions, an advantage to him; for it often  happens that apparent superiority does us damage, and that from apparent  defect springs the saving of our life.    Thus, while the companions of Nebsecht were employed in declaiming or in  singing, he, thanks to his fettered tongue, could give himself up to his  inherited and almost passionate love of observing organic life; and  his teachers indulged up to a certain point his innate spirit of  investigation, and derived benefit from his knowledge of the human and  animal structures, and from the dexterity of his handling.    His deep aversion for the magical part of his profession would have  brought him heavy punishment, nay very likely would have cost him  expulsion from the craft, if he had ever given it expression in any  form. But Nebsecht's was the silent and reserved nature of the learned  man, who free from all desire of external recognition, finds a rich  satisfaction in the delights of investigation; and he regarded every  demand on him to give proof of his capacity, as a vexatious but  unavoidable intrusion on his unassuming but laborious and fruitful  investigations.    Nebsecht was dearer and nearer to Pentaur than any other of his  associates.    He admired his learning and skill; and when the slightly-built surgeon,  who was indefatigable in his wanderings, roved through the thickets  by the Nile, the desert, or the mountain range, the young poet-priest  accompanied him with pleasure and with great benefit to himself, for his  companion observed a thousand things to which without him he would have  remained for ever blind; and the objects around him, which were known to  him only by their shapes, derived connection and significance from the  explanations of the naturalist, whose intractable tongue moved freely  when it was required to expound to his friend the peculiarities of  organic beings whose development he had been the first to detect.    The poet was dear in the sight of Nebsecht, and he loved Pentaur, who  possessed all the gifts he lacked; manly beauty, childlike lightness of  heart, the frankest openness, artistic power, and the gift of expressing  in word and song every emotion that stirred his soul. The poet was as a  novice in the order in which Nebsecht was master, but quite capable of  understanding its most difficult points; so it happened that Nebsecht  attached greater value to his judgment than to that of his own  colleagues, who showed themselves fettered by prejudice, while Pentaur's  decision always was free and unbiassed.    The naturalist's room lay on the ground floor, and had no living-rooms  above it, being under one of the granaries attached to the temple. It  was as large as a public hall, and yet Pentaur, making his way towards  the silent owner of the room, found it everywhere strewed with thick  bundles of every variety of plant, with cages of palm-twigs piled  four or five high, and a number of jars, large and small, covered  with perforated paper. Within these prisons moved all sorts of living  creatures, from the jerboa, the lizard of the Nile, and a light-colored  species of owl, to numerous specimens of frogs, snakes, scorpions and  beetles.    On the solitary table in the middle of the room, near to a  writing-stand, lay bones of animals, with various sharp flints and  bronze knives.    In a corner of this room lay a mat, on which stood a wooden head-prop,  indicating that the naturalist was in the habit of sleeping on it.    When Pentaur's step was heard on the threshold of this strange abode,  its owner pushed a rather large object under the table, threw a cover  over it, and hid a sharp flint scalpel       [The Egyptians seem to have preferred to use flint instruments for     surgical purposes, at any rate for the opening of bodies and for     circumcision. Many flint instruments have been found and preserved     in museums.]    fixed into a wooden handle, which he had just been using, in the folds  of his robe-as a school-boy might hide some forbidden game from his  master. Then he crossed his arms, to give himself the aspect of a man  who is dreaming in harmless idleness.    The solitary lamp, which was fixed on a high stand near his chair, shed  a scanty light, which, however, sufficed to show him his trusted friend  Pentaur, who had disturbed Nebsecht in his prohibited occupations.  Nebsecht nodded to him as he entered, and, when he had seen who it was,  said:    \"You need not have frightened me so!\" Then he drew out from under the  table the object he had hidden--a living rabbit fastened down to a  board-and continued his interrupted observations on the body, which he  had opened and fastened back with wooden pins while the heart continued  to beat.    He took no further notice of Pentaur, who for some time silently watched  the investigator; then he laid his hand on his shoulder and said:    \"Lock your door more carefully, when you are busy with forbidden  things.\"    \"They took--they took away the bar of the door lately,\" stammered the  naturalist, \"when they caught me dissecting the hand of the forger  Ptahmes.\"--[The law sentenced forgers to lose a hand.]    \"The mummy of the poor man will find its right hand wanting,\" answered  the poet.    \"He will not want it out there.\"    \"Did you bury the least bit of an image in his grave?\"       [Small statuettes, placed in graves to help the dead in the work     performed in the under-world. They have axes and ploughs in their     hands, and seed-bags on their backs. The sixth chapter of the Book     of the Dead is inscribed on nearly all.]    \"Nonsense.\"    \"You go very far, Nebsecht, and are not foreseeing, 'He who needlessly  hurts an innocent animal shall be served in the same way by the spirits  of the netherworld,' says the law; but I see what you will say. You hold  it lawful to put a beast to pain, when you can thereby increase that  knowledge by which you alleviate the sufferings of man, and enrich--\"    \"And do not you?\"    A gentle smile passed over Pentaur's face; leaned over the animal and  said:    \"How curious! the little beast still lives and breathes; a man would  have long been dead under such treatment. His organism is perhaps of a  more precious, subtle, and so more fragile nature?\"    Nebsecht shrugged his shoulders.    \"Perhaps!\" he said.    \"I thought you must know.\"    \"I--how should I?\" asked the leech. \"I have told you--they would not  even let me try to find out how the hand of a forger moves.\"    \"Consider, the scripture tells us the passage of the soul depends on the  preservation of the body.\"    Nebsecht looked up with his cunning little eyes and shrugging his  shoulders, said:    \"Then no doubt it is so: however these things do not concern me. Do  what you like with the souls of men; I seek to know something of their  bodies, and patch them when they are damaged as well as may be.\"    \"Nay-Toth be praised, at least you need not deny that you are master in  that art.\"       [Toth is the god of the learned and of physicians. The Ibis was     sacred to him, and he was usually represented as Ibis-headed. Ra     created him \"a beautiful light to show the name of his evil enemy.\"     Originally the Dfoon-god, he became the lord of time and measure.     He is the weigher, the philosopher among the gods, the lord of     writing, of art and of learning. The Greeks called him Hermes     Trismegistus, i.e. threefold or \"very great\" which was, in fact, in     imitation of the Egyptians, whose name Toth or Techud signified     twofold, in the same way \"very great\"]    \"Who is master,\" asked Nebsecht, \"excepting God? I can do nothing,  nothing at all, and guide my instruments with hardly more certainty than  a sculptor condemned to work in the dark.\"    \"Something like the blind Resu then,\" said Pentaur smiling, \"who  understood painting better than all the painters who could see.\"    \"In my operations there is a 'better' and a 'worse;'\" said Nebsecht,  \"but there is nothing 'good.'\"    \"Then we must be satisfied with the 'better,' and I have come to claim  it,\" said Pentaur.    \"Are you ill?\"    \"Isis be praised, I feel so well that I could uproot a palm-tree, but I  would ask you to visit a sick girl. The princess Bent-Anat--\"    \"The royal family has its own physicians.\"    \"Let me speak! the princess Bent-Anat has run over a young girl, and the  poor child is seriously hurt.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the student reflectively. \"Is she over there in the city,  or here in the Necropolis?\"    \"Here. She is in fact the daughter of a paraschites.\"    \"Of a paraschites?\" exclaimed Nebsecht, once more slipping the rabbit  under the table, \"then I will go.\"    \"You curious fellow. I believe you expect to find something strange  among the unclean folk.\"    \"That is my affair; but I will go. What is the man's name?\"    \"Pinem.\"    \"There will be nothing to be done with him,\" muttered the student,  \"however--who knows?\"    With these words he rose, and opening a tightly closed flask he dropped  some strychnine on the nose and in the mouth of the rabbit, which  immediately ceased to breathe. Then he laid it in a box and said, \"I am  ready.\"    \"But you cannot go out of doors in this stained dress.\"    The physician nodded assent, and took from a chest a clean robe, which  he was about to throw on over the other! but Pentaur hindered him.  \"First take off your working dress,\" he said laughing. \"I will help you.  But, by Besa, you have as many coats as an onion.\"       [Besa, the god of the toilet of the Egyptians. He was represented     as a deformed pigmy. He led the women to conquest in love, and the     men in war. He was probably of Arab origin.]    Pentaur was known as a mighty laugher among his companions, and his loud  voice rung in the quiet room, when he discovered that his friend was  about to put a third clean robe over two dirty ones,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess — Complete (#7)"],[1,"\"To me,\" said Rhodopis, turning to her new guests, \"you are heartily  welcome, but not more in your joy than if borne down by sadness. I know  no greater pleasure than to remove the lines of care from a friend's  brow. Spartan, I venture to address you as a friend too, for the friends  of my friends are my own.\" Aristomachus bowed in silence, but Phanes,  addressing himself both to Rhodopis and to the Sybarite, answered: \"Well  then, my friends, I can content you both. To you, Rhodopis, I must  come for comfort, for soon, too soon I must leave you and your pleasant  house; Philoinus however can still enjoy my mirth, as I cannot but  rejoice in the prospect of seeing my beloved Hellas once more, and  of quitting, even though involuntarily, this golden mouse-trap of a  country.\"    \"You are going away! you have been dismissed? Whither are you going?\"  echoed on all sides.    \"Patience, patience, my friends,\" cried Phanes. \"I have a long story  to tell, but I will rather reserve it for the evening meal. And indeed,  dear friend, my hunger is nearly as great as my distress at being  obliged to leave you.\"    \"Hunger is a good thing,\" philosophized the Sybarite once more, \"when a  man has a good meal in prospect.\"    \"On that point you may be at ease, Philoinus,\" answered Rhodopis. \"I  told the cook to do his utmost, for the most celebrated epicure from  the most luxurious city in the world, no less a person than Philoinus  of Sybaris, would pass a stern judgment on his delicate dishes.  Go, Knakias, tell them to serve the supper. Are you content now, my  impatient guests? As for me, since I heard Phanes' mournful news, the  pleasure of the meal is gone.\" The Athenian bowed, and the Sybarite  returned to his philosophy. \"Contentment is a good thing when every wish  can be satisfied. I owe you thanks, Rhodopis, for your appreciation of  my incomparable native city. What says Anakreon?              \"To-day is ours--what do we fear?            To-day is ours--we have it here.            Let's treat it kindly, that it may            Wish at least with us to stay.            Let's banish business, banish sorrow;            To the gods belongs to-morrow.\"    \"Eh! Ibykus, have I quoted your friend the poet correctly, who feasts  with you at Polykrates' banquets? Well, I think I may venture to say of  my own poor self that if Anakreon can make better verses, I understand  the art of living quite as well as he, though he writes so many poems  upon it. Why, in all his songs there is not one word about the pleasures  of the table! Surely they are as important as love and play! I confess  that the two last are clear to me also; still, I could exist without  them, though in a miserable fashion, but without food, where should we  be?\"    The Sybarite broke into a loud laugh at his own joke; but the Spartan  turned away from this conversation, drew Phryxus into a corner, and  quite abandoning his usually quiet and deliberate manner, asked eagerly  whether he had at last brought him the long wished for answer from the  Oracle. The serious features of the Delphian relaxed, and thrusting  his hand into the folds of his chiton,--[An undergarment resembling a  shirt.]--he drew out a little roll of parchment-like sheepskin, on which  a few lines were written.    The hands of the brave, strong Spartan trembled as he seized the roll,  and his fixed gaze on its characters was as if it would pierce the skin  on which they were inscribed.    Then, recollecting himself, he shook his head sadly and said: \"We  Spartans have to learn other arts than reading and writing; if thou  canst, read the what Pythia says.\"    The Delphian glanced over the writing and replied: \"Rejoice! Loxias  (Apollo) promises thee a happy return home; hearken to the prediction of  the priestess.\"      \"If once the warrior hosts from the snow-topped mountains descending     Come to the fields of the stream watering richly the plain,     Then shall the lingering boat to the beckoning meadows convey thee     Which to the wandering foot peace and a home will afford.     When those warriors come, from the snow-topped mountains descending,     Then will the powerful Five grant thee what long they refused.\"    To these words the Spartan listened with intense eagerness; he had them  read over to him twice, then repeated them from memory, thanked Phryxus,  and placed the roll within the folds of his garment.    The Delphian then took part in the general conversation, but  Aristomachus repeated the words of the Oracle unceasingly to himself in  a low voice, endeavoring to impress them on his memory, and to interpret  their obscure import.          CHAPTER II.    The doors of the supper-room now flew open. Two lovely, fair-haired  boys, holding myrtle-wreaths, stood on each side of the entrance, and  in the middle of the room was a large, low, brilliantly polished table,  surrounded by inviting purple cushions.       [It was most probably usual for each guest to have his own little     table; but we read even in Homer of large tables on which the meals     were served up. In the time of Homer people sat at table, but the     recumbent position became universal in later times.]    Rich nosegays adorned this table, and on it were placed large joints  of roast meat, glasses and dishes of various shapes filled with dates,  figs, pomegranates, melons and grapes, little silver beehives containing  honey, and plates of embossed copper, on which lay delicate cheese  from the island of Trinakria. In the midst was a silver table-ornament,  something similar to an altar, from which arose fragrant clouds of  incense.    At the extreme end of the table stood the glittering silver cup in which  the wine was to be mixed.       [The Greeks were not accustomed to drink unmingled wine. Zaleukus     forbade to all citizens the pure juice of the grape under penalty of     death, and Solon under very severe penalties, unless required as     medicine. The usual mixture was composed of three-fifths water to     two-fifths wine.]    This was of beautiful AEginetan workmanship, its crooked handles  representing two giants, who appeared ready to sink under the weight of  the bowl which they sustained.    Like the altar, it was enwreathed with flowers, and a garland of roses  or myrtle had been twined around the goblet of each guest.    The entire floor was strewed with rose-leaves, and the room lighted by  many lamps which were hung against the smooth, white, stucco walls.    No sooner were the guests reclining on their cushions, than the  fair-haired boys reappeared, wound garlands of ivy and myrtle around the  heads and shoulders of the revellers, and washed their feet in silver  basins. The Sybarite, though already scented with all the perfumes of  Arabia, would not rest until he was completely enveloped in roses and  myrtle, and continued to occupy the two boys even after the carver had  removed the first joints from the table in order to cut them up; but  as soon as the first course, tunny-fish with mustard-sauce, had been  served, he forgot all subordinate matters, and became absorbed in the  enjoyment of the delicious viands.    Rhodopis, seated on a chair at the head of the table, near the  wine-bowl, not only led the conversation, but gave directions to the  slaves in waiting.       [The women took their meals sitting. The Greeks, like the     Egyptians, had chairs with backs and arms. The form of the solia or     throne has become familiar to us from the discoveries at Pompeii and     the representations of many gods and distinguished persons. It had     a high, almost straight back, and supports for the arms.]    She gazed on her cheerful guests with a kind of pride, and seemed to be  devoting her attention to each exclusively, now asking the Delphian  how he had succeeded in his mission, then the Sybarite whether he was  content with the performances of her cook, and then listening eagerly  to Ibykus, as he told how the Athenian, Phrynichus, had introduced the  religious dramas of Thespis of Ikaria into common life, and was now  representing entire histories from the past by means of choruses,  recitative and answer.    Then she turned to the Spartan, remarking, that to him alone of all her  guests, instead of an apology for the simplicity of the meal, she felt  she owed one for its luxury. The next time he came, her slave Knakias,  who, as an escaped Helot, boasted that he could cook a delicious  blood-soup (here the Sybarite shuddered), should prepare him a true  Lacedaemonian repast.    When the guests had eaten sufficiently they again washed their hands;  the plates and dishes were removed, the floor cleansed, and wine and  water poured into the bowl.       [The Symposium began after the real meal. Not till that was over     did the guests usually adorn themselves with wreaths, wash their     hands with Smegma or Smema (a kind of soap) and begin to drink.]    At last, when Rhodopis had convinced herself that the right moment was  come, she turned to Phanes, who was engaged in a discussion with the  Milesians, and thus addressed him:    \"Noble friend, we have restrained our impatience so long that it must  surely now be your duty to tell us what evil chance is threatening to  snatch you from Egypt and from our circle. You may be able to leave us  and this country with a light heart, for the gods are wont to bless  you Ionians with that precious gift from your very birth, but we shall  remember you long and sadly. I know of no worse loss than that of a  friend tried through years, indeed some of us have lived too long on the  Nile not to have imbibed a little of the constant, unchanging Egyptian  temperament. You smile, and yet I feel sure that long as you have  desired to revisit your dear Hellas, you will not be able to leave us  quite without regret. Ah, you admit this? Well, I knew I had not been  deceived. But now tell us why you are obliged to leave Egypt, that we  may consider"]]]
