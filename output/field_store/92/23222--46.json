There  is no mean between the two and there are no degrees of either. To sin  is to cross the line. When once that has been done it makes no  difference to the offense how far you go. Trespassing at all is  forbidden. This doctrine was defended by the Stoics on account of its  bracing moral effect as showing the heinousness of sin. Horace gives  the judgment of the world in saying that common sense and morality,  to say nothing of utility, revolt against it.    Here are some other specimens of the Stoic paradoxes. \"Every fool is  mad\". \"Only the sage is free and every fool is a slave\". \"The sage  alone is wealthy\". \"Good men are always happy and bad men always  miserable\". \"All goods are equal\". \"No one is wiser or happier than  another\". But may not one man we ask be more nearly wise or more  nearly happy than another? \"That may be\", the Stoics would reply,  \"but the man who is only one stade from Canopus is as much not in  Canopus as the man who is a hundred stades off; and the eight day old  puppy is still as blind as on the day of its birth; nor can a man who  is near the surface of the sea breathe any more than if he were full  five hundred fathom down\".    It is only fair to the Stoics to add that paradoxes were quite the  order of the day in Greece, though they greatly outdid other schools  in producing them. Socrates himself was the father of paradox.  Epicurus maintained as staunchly as any Stoic that \"No wise man is  unhappy\", and, if he be not belied, went the length of declaring that  the wise man, if put into the bull of Phalaris would exclaim: \"How  delightful! How little I mind this!\"    It is out of keeping with common sense to draw a hard and fast  distinction between good and bad. Yet this was what the Stoics did.  They insisted on effecting here and now that separation between the  sheep and the goats, which Christ postponed to the Day of Judgment.  Unfortunately, when it came to practice, all were found to be goats,  so that the division was a merely formal one.    The good man of the Stoics was variously known as 'the sage', or,  'the serious man', the latter name being inherited from the  Peripatetics. We used to hear it said among ourselves that a person  had become serious, when he or she had taken to religion. Another  appellation which the Stoics had for the sage was 'the urbane man',  while the fool in contradistinction was called 'a boor'. Boorishness  was defined as an inexperience of the customs and laws of the state.  By the state was meant, not Athens or Sparta, as would have been the  case in a former age, but the society of all rational beings into  which the Stoics spiritualised the state. The sage alone had the  freedom of this city and the fool was therefore not only a boor, but  an alien or an exile. In this city, Justice was natural and not  conventional, for the law by which it was governed was the law of  right reason. The law then was spiritualised by the Stoics, just as  the state was. It no longer meant the enactments of this or that  community, but the mandates of the eternal reason which ruled the  world and which would prevail in the ideal state. Law was defined as  right reason commanding what was to be done and forbidding what was  not to be done. As such, it in no way differed from the impulse of  the sage himself.    As a member of a state and by nature subject to law, man was  essentially a social being. Between all the wise there existed  \"unanimity,\" which was \"a knowledge of the common good,\" because  their views of life were harmonious. Fools, on the other hand, whose  views of life were discordant, were enemies to one another and bent  on mutual injury.    As a member of society the sage would play his part in public life.  Theoretically this was always true, and practically he would do so,  wherever the actual constitution made any tolerable approach to the  ideal type. But, if the circumstances were such as to make it certain  that his embarking on politics would be of no service to his country,  and only a source of danger to himself, then he would refrain. The  kind of constitution of which the Stoics most approved was a mixed  government containing democratic, aristocratic, and monarchical  elements. Where circumstances allowed the sage would act as  legislator, and would educate mankind, one way of doing which was by  writing books which would prove of profit to the reader.    As a member of existing society the sage would marry and beget  children, both for his own sake and for that of his country, on  behalf of which, if it were good, he would be ready to suffer and  die. Still he would look forward to a better time when, in Zeno's as  in Plato's republic, the wise would have women and children in  common, when the elders would love all the rising generation equally  with parental fondness, and when marital jealousy would be no more.    As being essentially a social being, the sage was endowed not only  with the graver political virtues, but also with the graces of life.  He was sociable, tactful and stimulating, using conversation as a  means for promoting good will and friendship; so far as might be, he  was all things to all men, which made him fascinating and charming,  insinuating and even wily; he know how to hit the point and to choose  the right moment, yet with it all he was plain and unostentatious and  simple and unaffected; in particular he never delighted in irony much  less in sarcasm.    From the social characteristics of the sage we turn now to a side of  his character which appears eminently anti-social. One of his most  highly vaunted characteristics was his self-sufficingness. He was to  be able to step out of a burning city, coming from the wreck not only  of his fortunes, but of his friends and family, and to declare with a  smile that he has lost nothing. All that he truly cared for was to be  centered in himself. Only thus could he be sure that Fortune would  not wrest it from him.    The apathy or passionlessness of the sage is another of his most  salient features. The passions being, on Zeno's showing, not natural,  but forms of disease, the sage, as being the perfect man, would of  course be wholly free from them. They were so many disturbances of  the even flow in which his bliss lay. The sage therefore would never  be moved by a feeling of favour towards any one; he would never  pardon a fault; he would never feel pity; he would never be prevailed  upon by entreaty; he would never be stirred to anger.    As to the absence of pity in the sage, the Stoics themselves must  have felt some difficulty there since we find Epictetus recommending  his hearers to show grief out of sympathy for another, but to be  careful not to feel it. The inexorability of the sage was a mere  consequence of his calm reasonableness, which would lead him to take  the right view from the first. Lastly, the sage would never be  stirred to anger. For why should it stir his anger to see another in  his ignorance injuring himself?    One more touch has yet to be added to the apathy of the sage. He was  impervious to wonder. No miracle of nature could excite his  astonishment--no mephitic caverns, which men deemed the mouths of  hell, no deep-drawn ebb tides--the standing marvel of the  Mediterranean dweller, no hot springs, no spouting jets of fire.    From the absence of passion it is but a step to the absence of error.  So we pass now to the infallibility of the sage--a monstrous doctrine  which was never broached in the schools before Zeno. The sage, it was  maintained, held no opinions, he never repented of his conduct, he  was never deceived in anything. Between the daylight of knowledge and  darkness of nescience Plato had interposed the twilight of opinion  wherein men walked for the most part. Not so however the Stoic sage.  Of him it might be said, as Charles Lamb said of the Scotchman with  whom he so imperfectly sympathized: \"His understanding is always at  its meridian--you never see the first dawn, the early streaks.\" He  has no falterings of self suspicion. Surmises, guesses, misgivings,  half intuitions, semiconsciousness, partial illuminations, dim  instincts, embryo conceptions, have no place in his brain or  vocabulary. The twilight of dubiety never falls upon him. Opinion,  whether in the form of an ungripped assent, or a weak supposition,  was alien from the mental disposition of the serious man. With him  there was no hasty or premature assent of the understanding, no  forgetfulness, no distrust. He never allowed himself to be  overreached or deluded, never had need of an arbiter, never was out  in his reckoning nor put out by another. No urbane man ever wandered  from his way, or missed his mark, or saw wrong, or heard amiss, or  erred in any of his senses; he never conjectured nor thought of a  better thing, for the one was a form of imperfect assent, and the  other a sign of previous precipitancy. There was with him no change,  no retraction, and no tripping. These things were for those whose  dogmas could alter. After this it is almost superfluous for us to be  assured that the sage never got drunk. Drunkenness, as Zeno pointed  out, involved babbling, and of that the sage would never be guilty.  He would not, however, altogether eschew banquets. Indeed, the Stoics  recognized a virtue under the name of 'conviviality,' which consisted  in the proper conduct of them. It was said of Chrysippus that his  demeanor was always quiet, even if his gait were unsteady, so that  his housekeeper declared that only his legs were drunk.    There were pleasantries even within the school on this subject of  infallibility of the sage. Aristo of Chios, while seceding on some  other matters, held fast to the dogma that the sage never opined.  Whereupon Persaeus played a trick upon him. He made one of two twin  brothers deposit a sum"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#7)"],[1,"darkest nights for an attack; and strike terror by the funereal gloom of  their sable bands--no enemy being able to sustain their singular, and,  as it were, infernal appearance; since in every combat the eyes are the  first part subdued. Beyond the Lygii are the Gothones, [241] who live  under a monarchy, somewhat more strict than that of the other German  nations, yet not to a degree incompatible with liberty. Adjoining  to these are the Rugii [242] and Lemovii, [243] situated on the  sea-coast--all these tribes are distinguished by round shields, short  swords, and submission to regal authority.    44. Next occur the communities of the Suiones, [244] seated in the very  Ocean, [245] who, besides their strength in men and arms, also possess a  naval force. [246] The form of their vessels differs from ours in having  a prow at each end, [247] so that they are always ready to advance. They  make no use of sails, nor have regular benches of oars at the sides:  they row, as is practised in some rivers, without order, sometimes on  one side, sometimes on the other, as occasion requires. These people  honor wealth; [248] for which reason they are subject to monarchical  government, without any limitations, [249] or precarious conditions of  allegiance. Nor are arms allowed to be kept promiscuously, as among the  other German nations: but are committed to the charge of a keeper, and  he, too, a slave. The pretext is, that the Ocean defends them from any  sudden incursions; and men unemployed, with arms in their hands, readily  become licentious. In fact, it is for the king's interest not to entrust  a noble, a freeman, or even an emancipated slave, with the custody of  arms.    45. Beyond the Suiones is another sea, sluggish and almost stagnant,  [250] by which the whole globe is imagined to be girt and enclosed, from  this circumstance, that the last light of the setting sun continues so  vivid till its rising, as to obscure the stars. [251] Popular belief  adds, that the sound of his emerging [252] from the ocean is also heard;  and the forms of deities, [253] with the rays beaming from his head, are  beheld. Only thus far, report says truly, does nature extend. [254] On  the right shore of the Suevic sea [255] dwell the tribes of the Aestii,  [256] whose dress and customs are the same with those of the Suevi, but  their language more resembles the British. [257] They worship the mother  of the gods; [258] and as the symbol of their superstition, they carry  about them the figures of wild boars. [250] This serves them in place of  armor and every other defence: it renders the votary of the goddess safe  even in the midst of foes. Their weapons are chiefly clubs, iron being  little used among them. They cultivate corn and other fruits of the  earth with more industry than German indolence commonly exerts. [260]  They even explore the sea; and are the only people who gather amber,  which by them is called _Glese_, [261] and is collected among the  shallows and upon the shore. [262] With the usual indifference of  barbarians, they have not inquired or ascertained from what natural  object or by what means it is produced. It long lay disregarded [263]  amidst other things thrown up by the sea, till our luxury [264] gave  it a name. Useless to them, they gather it in the rough; bring it  unwrought; and wonder at the price they receive. It would appear,  however, to be an exudation from certain trees; since reptiles, and even  winged animals, are often seen shining through it, which, entangled  in it while in a liquid state, became enclosed as it hardened. [264] I  should therefore imagine that, as the luxuriant woods and groves in the  secret recesses of the East exude frankincense and balsam, so there are  the same in the islands and continents of the West; which, acted upon  by the near rays of the sun, drop their liquid juices into the subjacent  sea, whence, by the force of tempests, they are thrown out upon the  opposite coasts. If the nature of amber be examined by the application  of fire, it kindles like a torch, with a thick and odorous flame; and  presently resolves into a glutinous matter resembling pitch or resin.  The several communities of the Sitones [266] succeed those of the  Suiones; to whom they are similar in other respects, but differ in  submitting to a female reign; so far have they degenerated, not only  from liberty, but even from slavery. Here Suevia terminates.    46. I am in doubt whether to reckon the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni among  the Germans or Sarmatians; [267] although the Peucini, [268] who are by  some called Bastarnae, agree with the Germans in language, apparel,  and habitations. [269] All of them live in filth and laziness. The  intermarriages of their chiefs with the Sarmatians have debased them  by a mixture of the manners of that people. [270] The Venedi have  drawn much from this source; [271] for they overrun in their predatory  excursions all the woody and mountainous tracts between the Peucini and  Fenni. Yet even these are rather to be referred to the Germans, since  they build houses, carry shields, and travel with speed on foot; in  all which particulars they totally differ from the Sarmatians, who pass  their time in wagons and on horseback. [272] The Fenni [273] live in a  state of amazing savageness and squalid poverty. They are destitute  of arms, horses, and settled abodes: their food is herbs; [274] their  clothing, skins; their bed, the ground. Their only dependence is on  their arrows, which, for want of iron, are headed with bone; [275] and  the chase is the support of the women as well as the men; the former  accompany the latter in the pursuit, and claim a share of the prey. Nor  do they provide any other shelter for their infants from wild beasts and  storms, than a covering of branches twisted together. This is the resort  of youth; this is the receptacle of old age. Yet even this way of life  is in their estimation happier than groaning over the plough; toiling  in the erection of houses; subjecting their own fortunes and those of  others to the agitations of alternate hope and fear. Secure against men,  secure against the gods, they have attained the most difficult point,  not to need even a wish.    All our further accounts are intermixed with fable; as, that the  Hellusii and Oxionae [276] have human faces, with the bodies and limbs  of wild beasts. These unauthenticated reports I shall leave untouched.  [277]          THE LIFE OF CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA.      [This work is supposed by the commentators to have been written before  the treatise on the manners of the Germans, in the third consulship of  the emperor Nerva, and the second of Verginius Rufus, in the year of  Rome 850, and of the Christian era 97. Brotier accedes to this opinion;  but the reason which he assigns does not seem to be satisfactory. He  observes that Tacitus, in the third section, mentions the emperor Nerva;  but as he does not call him Divus Nerva, the deified Nerva, the learned  commentator infers that Nerva was still living. This reasoning might  have some weight, if we did not read, in section 44, that it was the  ardent wish of Agricola that he might live to behold Trajan in the  imperial seat. If Nerva was then alive, the wish to see another in his  room would have been an awkward compliment to the reigning prince. It  is, perhaps, for this reason that Lipsius thinks this very elegant tract  was written at the same time with the Manners of the Germans, in the  beginning of the emperor Trajan. The question is not very material,  since conjecture alone must decide it. The piece itself is admitted to  be a masterpiece in the kind. Tacitus was son-in-law to Agricola; and  while filial piety breathes through his work, he never departs from  the integrity of his own character. He has left an historical monument  highly interesting to every Briton, who wishes to know the manners of  his ancestors, and the spirit of liberty that from the earliest time  distinguished the natives of Britain. \"Agricola,\" as Hume observes, \"was  the general who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this  island. He governed, it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian.  He carried his victorious arms northward: defeated the Britons in every  encounter, pierced into the forests and the mountains of Caledonia,  reduced every state to subjection in the southern parts of the island,  and chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable  spirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude  under the victors. He defeated them in a decisive action, which they  fought under Galgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons between the  friths of Clyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more barren parts  of the island, and secured the Roman province from the incursions of the  barbarous inhabitants. During these military enterprises he neglected  not the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the  Britons; taught them to desire and raise all the conveniences of life;  reconciled them to the Roman language and manners; instructed them  in letters and science; and employed every expedient to render those  chains, which he had forged, both easy and agreeable to them.\" (Hume's  Hist. vol. i. p. 9.) In this passage Mr. Hume has given a summary of the  Life of Agricola. It is extended by Tacitus in a style more open than  the didactic form of the essay on the German Manners required, but  still with the precision, both in sentiment and diction, peculiar to  the author. In rich but subdued colors he gives a striking picture of  Agricola, leaving to posterity a portion of history which it would be  in vain to seek in the dry gazette style of Suetonius, or in the page of  any writer of that period.]      1.
