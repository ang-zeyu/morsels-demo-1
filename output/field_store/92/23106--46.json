Ingenious men, Meusnier, Giffard, Tissandier, Renard, Krebs, many others  worked over that problem through the entire nineteenth century. They  devised ballonets or air compartments to keep the pressure up. They  built airships of cylinder shape, spindle shape, torpedo shape, airships  shaped like a cigar, like a string bean, like a whale. But the stumbling  block remained, the need of an efficient power plant.    The steam engine was dependable, but once you had installed firebox,  boiler and cord wood aboard, there was little if any lift remaining for  crew or cargo. Giffard in 1852 built an ingenious small engine using  steam but it still weighed 100 pounds per horsepower, drove the ship at  a speed of only three miles an hour. Automobile engines today weigh as  little as six pounds per horsepower, modern airplane engines one pound  per horsepower.    Man experimented with feather-bladed oars, with a screw propeller,  turned by hand, using a crew of eight men. Haenlein, German, built a  motor that would use the lifting gas from the ship--coal gas or  hydrogen. Rennard in 1884 built an electric motor, taking power from a  storage battery.    But real progress would have to wait for the discovery of petroleum in  Pennsylvania and the invention of the internal combustion engine. When  the gasoline engine came in, in the 90's, the dirigible builders saw the  long sought key to their problem.    While Count Zeppelin was experimenting with his big ships in Germany,  Lebaudy, Juliot, Clement Bayard in France and most conspicuously the  young Brazilian, Santos Dumont, were working with the smaller  dirigibles. Santos Dumont built 14 airships in the first decade of the  century, brought the attention of the world to this project. He won a  100,000 franc prize in 1901 for flying across Paris to circle Eiffel  Tower and return to his starting point--and gave the money to the Paris  poor.    The Wright Brothers made their historic flight at Kitty Hawk, in 1903,  opening a different field of experiment. France pushed both lines of  research. After Santos Dumont's dirigible flight, Bleriot started from  the little town of Toury in an airplane, flew to the next town and back,  a distance of 17 miles, making only two en route stops,--and the town  erected a monument to him.    In 1909, Bleriot flew a plane across the English Channel and in the  following year the airship Clement Bayard II duplicated the feat,  carrying a crew of seven, made the 242 miles to London in six hours.    The year 1910 was a momentous one for all aircraft, with France as the  world center. Bleriot and Farman, Frenchmen, Latham, British, the  Wrights and Curtiss, Americans, broke records almost daily at a big meet  in August that year, while at longer range the French and English  dirigibles and the Parsevals of Germany, and still more important the  great Zeppelins at Lake Constance droned the news of a new epoch.    A young American engineer, P. W. Litchfield, attended the Paris meet,  saw these wonders, made notes. He stopped in Scotland on his way back,  bought a machine for spreading rubber on fabric, hired the two men  tending it (those men, Ferguson and Aikman, were still at their posts in  Akron thirty odd years later), hired two young technical graduates on  his return, tied in the fortunes of his struggling company with what he  believed was a coming industry.    The next five years would see the nations of the world bending their  efforts toward perfecting these vehicles of flight,--little realizing  they were building a combat weapon which would revolutionize warfare.                                         CHAPTER V                 Effect on Aeronautics of Post-War Reaction          [Illustration: Airship and escort planes]    Development of non-rigid airships slowed down after the impetus of the  war had spent itself, as was the case in aeronautics generally and in  all defense efforts.    With the Armistice of November, 1918, the world was through with war.  Men relaxed and reaction set in. There would not be another major war in  a hundred years. Well-meaning people everywhere grasped at the straw of  universal peace, of negotiated settlement of difficulties between  nations, of disarmament of military forces to the point of being little  more than an international police force. Germany, the trouble-maker, had  been disarmed and handcuffed, would make no more trouble. The world,  breathing freely after four years, wanted only to be left alone.    Today with major countries striving feverishly to build guns and navies,  it is hard to believe that na√Øve nations were scrapping ships only a few  years ago and pledging themselves to limit future building. No one in  the immediate post-war era could believe that men must prepare for  another war, an all-out war more terrible and ruthless than men had  known,--one which would send flame-spitting machines down from the air  and through woods and fields, against which conventional foot soldiers  would be as helpless as if they carried bows and arrows. Wishing only to  live at peace with other nations, we could conceive no need to make  defense preparation against frightfulness.    Congress was divided between \"big navy men\" and \"little navy men,\" and  generals and admirals who brought in programs for expansion or even  reasonable maintenance were shouted down. The public was in no mood to  listen.    If the usefulness of the Army and Navy was discounted during this  period, more so was the rising new Air Force. Few were interested in  airplanes, and these chiefly wartime pilots, who sought to keep aviation  alive, made a precarious living flying wartime \"Jennies\" and \"Standards\"  out of cow pastures, carrying passengers at a dollar a head, or how much  have you. The word \"haywire\" came into the language, as they made  open-air repairs to wings and fuselage with baling wire.    Lighter-than-air had no Rickenbackers or Richthofens to point to, but  got some advantage during this period from the activities of the  Shenandoah, completed in 1923, and the Los Angeles, delivered in 1924.  These ships could not be regarded as military craft, carried no arms.  The Shenandoah was experimental, based on a 1916 design. The Los Angeles  was technically a commercial ship, with passenger accommodations built  in, could be used only for training.    This grew out of the fact that the Allies planned to order the Zeppelin  works at Friedrichshafen torn down but had held up the order long enough  for it to turn out one more ship. This last ship would be given to  United States in lieu of the Zeppelin this country would have received  from Germany, if the airship crews, like those of the surface fleet, had  not scuttled their craft after the Armistice, to keep them from falling  into enemy hands. The Allies stipulated that the Los Angeles should  carry no armament. It took a specific waiver from them for the ship to  take part several years later in fleet maneuvers.    Other airship activities in this country were at a minimum. The blimps,  little heard of in this country during War I, remained in the  background. A joint board of the two services gave the Navy  responsibility for developing rigid airships, the Army to take  non-rigids and semi-rigids. The Navy maintained a few post-war blimps  for training, had little funds except for maintenance.    The Army, having Wright Field to do its engineering and experimental  work, fared somewhat better, carried on a training and something of a  development program. It built bases at Scott Field, Ill., and Langley  Field, Va., ordered one or two non-rigid ships a year, purchased a  semi-rigid ship from Italy, ordered another, the RS-1, from Goodyear,  operated it successfully.    The Army's non-rigids, however, were overshadowed by the Navy's rigids  and even more by its own airplanes, with the result finally that the  Chief of the Air Corps, Major General O. O. Westover, a believer in  lighter-than-air, an airship as well as airplane pilot, and a former  winner of the James Gordon Bennett cup in international balloon racing,  told Congress bluntly that there was no point in dragging along, that  unless funds were appropriated for a real airship program the Army might  as well close up shop. And this step Congress, in the end, took, and the  Army blimps and equipment were transferred to the Navy, and the  experimental program started by the one service was carried on by the  other.    The rigid ships were in more favorable position because they seemed to  have commercial possibilities, and it was the long-range policy of the  government to aid transportation. Government support to commercial  airships could be justified under the policy by which the government  gave land grants to the railways, built highways for the automobile,  deepened harbors and built lighthouses for the steamships, laid out  airports for planes, gave airmail contracts to keep the U. S. merchant  flag floating on the high seas and air routes open over land.    On this theory Navy airships, even though semi-military, got some  support during the reaction period, because they might blaze a trail  later for commercial lines--which, with ships and crews and terminals,  would be available in emergency as a secondary line of defense, like the  merchant marine.    The little non-rigid blimps remained the neglected Cinderellas of  post-war days.    The Goodyear Company at Akron, which had built 1000 balloons of all  types and 100 airships during and after the war, stepped into the  picture during this period with a modest program of its own. The first  of the Goodyear fleet, the pioneer, helium-inflated Pilgrim, now in the  Smithsonian Institute, was built in 1925.        [Illustration: The Atlantic crossing of the Graf Zeppelin in 1928      and its round-the-world flight in the following year gave new      stimulus to all aeronautics.

The conversation began with the question addressed to the Consul.    \"Are you well?\"    Consul.--\"Yes, thank you. How is His Highness?\"    Highness.--\"Quite well!\"    Highness to me.--\"Are you well?\"    Answer.--\"Quite well, thanks!\"    The Consul now introduces business; and questions about my travels  follow from His Highness--    \"How do you like Persia?\"    \"Have you seen Kerbela, Bagdad, Masr, Stamboul?\"    \"Have the Turks many soldiers?\"    \"How many has Persia?\"    \"Is Persia fertile?\"    \"How do you like Zanzibar?\"    Having answered each question to his Highness' satisfaction, he handed  me letters of introduction to his officers at Bagamoyo and Kaole, and a  general introductory letter to all Arab merchants whom I might meet on  the road, and concluded his remarks to me, with the expressed hope, that  on whatever mission I was bound, I should be perfectly successful.    We bowed ourselves out of his presence in much the same manner that we  had bowed ourselves in, he accompanying us to the great entrance door.    Mr. Goodhue of Salem, an American merchant long resident in Zanzibar,  presented me, as I gave him my adieu, with a blooded bay horse, imported  from the Cape of Good Hope, and worth, at least at Zanzibar, $500.    Feb. 4.--By the 4th of February, twenty-eight days from the date of my  arrival at Zanzibar, the organization and equipment of the \"'New  York Herald' Expedition\" was complete; tents and saddles had been  manufactured, boats and sails were ready. The donkeys brayed, and the  horses neighed impatiently for the road.    Etiquette demanded that I should once more present my card to the  European and American Consuls at Zanzibar, and the word \"farewell\" was  said to everybody.    On the fifth day, four dhows were anchored before the American  Consulate. Into one were lifted the two horses, into two others the  donkeys, into the fourth, the largest, the black escort, and bulky  moneys of the Expedition.    A little before noon we set sail. The American flag, a present to the  Expedition by that kind-hearted lady, Mrs. Webb, was raised to the  mast-head; the Consul, his lady, and exuberant little children, Mary  and Charley, were on the housetop waving the starry banner, hats, and  handkerchiefs, a token of farewell to me and mine. Happy people, and  good! may their course and ours be prosperous, and may God's blessing  rest on us all!        CHAPTER IV. -- LIFE AT BAGAMOYO.      The isle of Zanzibar with its groves of cocoa-nut, mango, clove,  and cinnamon, and its sentinel islets of Chumbi and French, with its  whitewashed city and jack-fruit odor, with its harbor and ships that  tread the deep, faded slowly from view, and looking westward, the  African continent rose, a similar bank of green verdure to that which  had just receded till it was a mere sinuous line above the horizon,  looming in a northerly direction to the sublimity of a mountain chain.  The distance across from Zanzibar to Bagamoyo may be about twenty-five  miles, yet it took the dull and lazy dhows ten hours before they dropped  anchor on the top of the coral reef plainly visible a few feet below the  surface of the water, within a hundred yards of the beach.    The newly-enlisted soldiers, fond of noise and excitement, discharged  repeated salvos by way of a salute to the mixed crowd of Arabs, Banyans,  and Wasawahili, who stood on the beach to receive the Musungu (white  man), which they did with a general stare and a chorus of \"Yambo, bana?\"  (how are you, master?)    In our own land the meeting with a large crowd is rather a tedious  operation, as our independent citizens insist on an interlacing of  fingers, and a vigorous shaking thereof before their pride is satisfied,  and the peaceful manifestation endorsed; but on this beach, well lined  with spectators, a response of \"Yambo, bana!\" sufficed, except with one  who of all there was acknowledged the greatest, and who, claiming, like  all great men, individual attention, came forward to exchange another  \"Yambo!\" on his own behalf, and to shake hands. This personage with a  long trailing turban, was Jemadar Esau, commander of the Zanzibar force  of soldiers, police, or Baluch gendarmes stationed at Bagamoyo. He had  accompanied Speke and Grant a good distance into the interior, and they  had rewarded him liberally. He took upon himself the responsibility of  assisting in the debarkation of the Expedition, and unworthy as was his  appearance, disgraceful as he was in his filth, I here commend him for  his influence over the rabble to all future East African travellers.    Foremost among those who welcomed us was a Father of the Society of  St.-Esprit, who with other Jesuits, under Father Superior Horner, have  established a missionary post of considerable influence and merit at  Bagamoyo. We were invited to partake of the hospitality of the Mission,  to take our meals there, and, should we desire it, to pitch our camp  on their grounds. But however strong the geniality of the welcome and  sincere the heartiness of the invitation, I am one of those who prefer  independence to dependence if it is possible. Besides, my sense of the  obligation between host and guest had just had a fine edge put upon  it by the delicate forbearance of my kind host at Zanzibar, who had  betrayed no sign of impatience at the trouble I was only too conscious  of having caused him. I therefore informed the hospitable Padre, that  only for one night could I suffer myself to be enticed from my camp.    I selected a house near the western outskirts of the town, where there  is a large open square through which the road from Unyanyembe enters.  Had I been at Bagamoyo a month, I could not have bettered my location.  My tents were pitched fronting the tembe (house) I had chosen, enclosing  a small square, where business could be transacted, bales looked over,  examined, and marked, free from the intrusion of curious sightseers.  After driving the twenty-seven animals of the Expedition into the  enclosure in the rear of the house, storing the bales of goods, and  placing a cordon of soldiers round, I proceeded to the Jesuit Mission,  to a late dinner, being tired and ravenous, leaving the newly-formed  camp in charge of the white men and Capt. Bombay.    The Mission is distant from the town a good half mile, to the north of  it; it is quite a village of itself, numbering some fifteen or sixteen  houses. There are more than ten padres engaged in the establishment,  and as many sisters, and all find plenty of occupation in educing from  native crania the fire of intelligence. Truth compels me to state that  they are very successful, having over two hundred pupils, boys and  girls, in the Mission, and, from the oldest to the youngest, they show  the impress of the useful education they have received.    The dinner furnished to the padres and their guest consisted of as many  plats as a first-class hotel in Paris usually supplies, and cooked with  nearly as much skill, though the surroundings were by no means equal.  I feel assured also that the padres, besides being tasteful in their  potages and entrees, do not stultify their ideas for lack of that  element which Horace, Hafiz, and Byron have praised so much. The  champagne--think of champagne Cliquot in East Africa!--Lafitte, La Rose,  Burgundy, and Bordeaux were of first-rate quality, and the meek and  lowly eyes of the fathers were not a little brightened under the  vinous influence. Ah! those fathers understand life, and appreciate its  duration. Their festive board drives the African jungle fever from their  doors, while it soothes the gloom and isolation which strike one with  awe, as one emerges from the lighted room and plunges into the depths  of the darkness of an African night, enlivened only by the wearying  monotone of the frogs and crickets, and the distant ululation of the  hyena. It requires somewhat above human effort, unaided by the ruby  liquid that cheers, to be always suave and polite amid the dismalities  of native life in Africa.    After the evening meal, which replenished my failing strength, and for  which I felt the intensest gratitude, the most advanced of the pupils  came forward, to the number of twenty, with brass instruments,  thus forming a full band of music. It rather astonished me to hear  instrumental sounds issue forth in harmony from such woolly-headed  youngsters; to hear well-known French music at this isolated port,  to hear negro boys, that a few months ago knew nothing beyond the  traditions of their ignorant mothers, stand forth and chant Parisian  songs about French valor and glory, with all the sangfroid of gamins  from the purlieus of Saint-Antoine.    I had a most refreshing night's rest, and at dawn I sought out my  camp, with a will to enjoy the new life now commencing. On counting the  animals, two donkeys were missing; and on taking notes of my African  moneys, one coil of No. 6 wire was not to be found. Everybody had  evidently fallen on the ground to sleep, oblivious of the fact that  on the coast there are many dishonest prowlers at night. Soldiers were  despatched to search through the town and neighbourhood, and Jemadar  Esau was apprised of our loss, and stimulated to discover the animals  by the promise of a reward. Before night one of the missing donkeys was  found outside the town nibbling at manioc-leaves, but the other animal  and the coil of wire were never found.    Among my visitors this first day at Bagamoyo was Ali bin Salim, a  brother of the famous Sayd bin Salim, formerly Ras Kafilah to Burton  and Speke, and subsequently to Speke and Grant. His salaams were very  profuse, and moreover, his brother was to be my agent in Unyamwezi, so  that I did not hesitate to accept his offer of assistance. But, alas,  for my white face and too trustful nature! this Ali bin Salim turned out  to be a snake in the grass, a very"]]]
