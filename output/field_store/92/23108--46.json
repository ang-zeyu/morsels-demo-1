As they drew nearer the castle it towered above them like a veritable  mountain, so big and high was it; and the walls cast deep shadows far  around, as if twilight had fallen.  They heard the loud blare of a  trumpet sounding far up on the battlements; the portals of the castle  suddenly opened wide, and they entered a vast courtyard paved with  plates of gold.  Tiny dwarfs, so crooked that they resembled crabs,  rushed forward and seized the bridles of the horses, while the  strangers slowly dismounted and looked around them.    While the steeds were being led to the stables an old man, clothed in a  flowing robe as white in color as his beard, bowed before Prince Marvel  and said in a soft voice:    \"Follow me!\"    The prince stretched his arms, yawned as if tired with his ride, and  then glared upon the old man with an expression of haughty surprise.    \"I follow no one!\" said he, proudly.  \"I am Prince Marvel, sirrah, and  if the owner of this castle wishes to see me I shall receive him here,  as befits my rank and station.\"    The man looked surprised, but only bowed lower than before.    \"It is the king's command,\" he answered.    \"The king?\"    \"Yes; you are in the castle of King Terribus, the lord and ruler of  Spor.\"    \"That is different,\" remarked the prince, lightly.  \"Still, I will  follow no man.  Point out the way and I will go to meet his Majesty.\"    The old man extended a lean and trembling finger toward an archway.  Prince Marvel strode forward, followed by Nerle, and passing under the  arch he threw open a door at the far end and boldly entered the  throne-room of King Terribus.        8.  The Fool-Killer    The room was round, with a dome at the top.  The bare walls were of  gray stone, with square, open windows set full twenty feet from the  floor.  Rough gray stone also composed the floor, and in the center of  the room stood one great rock with a seat hollowed in its middle.  This  was the throne, and round about it stood a swarm of men and women  dressed in rich satins, velvets and brocades, brilliantly ornamented  with gold and precious stones.  The men were of many shapes and  sizes--giants and dwarfs being among them.  The women all seemed young  and beautiful.    Prince Marvel cast but a passing glance at this assemblage, for his eye  quickly sought the rude throne on which was seated King Terribus.    The personal appearance of this monster was doubtless the most hideous  known in that age of the world.  His head was large and shaped like an  egg; it was bright scarlet in color and no hair whatever grew upon it.  It had three eyes--one in the center of his face, one on the top of his  head and one in the back.  Thus he was always able to see in every  direction at the same time.  His nose was shaped like an elephant's  trunk, and swayed constantly from side to side.  His mouth was very  wide and had no lips at all, two rows of sharp and white teeth being  always plainly visible beneath the swaying nose.    King Terribus, although surrounded by so splendid a court, wore a  simple robe of gray cloth, with no ornament or other finery, and his  strange and fearful appearance was strongly contrasted with the  glittering raiment of his courtiers and the beauty of his ladies in  waiting.    When Prince Marvel, with Nerle marching close behind, entered the great  room, Terribus looked at him sharply a moment, and then bowed.  And  when he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at  the intruders.    Then the king spoke, his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it  almost shocked Nerle, who had expected to hear a roar like that from a  wild beast.    \"Why are you here?\" asked Terribus.    \"Partly by chance and partly from curiosity,\" answered Prince Marvel.  \"No one in this island, except your own people, had ever seen the king  of Spor; so, finding myself in your country, I decided to come here and  have a look at you.\"    The faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened  looks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible  monarch.  But the king merely nodded and inquired:    \"Since you have seen me, what do you think of me?\"    \"I am sorry you asked that question,\" returned the prince; \"for I must  confess you are a very frightful-looking creature, and not at all  agreeable to gaze upon.\"    \"Ha! you are honest, as well as frank,\" exclaimed the king.  \"But that  is the reason I do not leave my kingdom, as you will readily  understand.  And that is the reason I never permit strangers to come  here, under penalty of death.  So long as no one knows the King of Spor  is a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very  sensitive regarding my personal appearance.  You will perhaps  understand that if I could have chosen I should have been born  beautiful instead of ugly.\"    \"I certainly understand that.  And permit me to say I wish you were  beautiful.  I shall probably dream of you for many nights,\" added the  prince.    \"Not for many,\" said King Terribus, quietly.  \"By coming here you have  chosen death, and the dead do not dream.\"    \"Why should I die?\" inquired Prince Marvel, curiously.    \"Because you have seen me.  Should I allow you to go away you would  tell the world about my ugly face.  I do not like to kill you, believe  me; but you must pay the penalty of your rashness--you and the man  behind you.\"    Nerle smiled at this; but whether from pride at being called a man or  in pleasurable anticipation of the sufferings to come I leave you to  guess.    \"Will you allow me to object to being killed?\" asked the prince.    \"Certainly,\" answered the king, courteously.  \"I expect you to object.  It is natural.  But it will do you no good.\"    Then Terribus turned to an attendant and commanded:    \"Send hither the Fool-Killer.\"    At this Prince Marvel laughed outright.    \"The Fool-Killer!\" he cried; \"surely your Majesty does me little  credit.  Am I, then, a fool?\"    \"You entered my kingdom uninvited,\" retorted the king, \"and you tell me  to my face I am ugly.  Moreover, you laugh when I condemn you to death.  From this I conclude the Fool-Killer is the proper one to execute you.  Behold!\"    Marvel turned quickly, to find a tall, stalwart man standing behind  him.  His features were strong but very grave, and the prince caught a  look of compassion in his eye as their gaze met.  His skin was fair and  without blemish, a robe of silver cloth fell from his shoulders, and in  his right hand he bore a gleaming sword.    \"Well met!\" cried Marvel, heartily, as he bowed to the Fool-Killer.  \"I  have often heard your name mentioned, but 'tis said in the world that  you are a laggard in your duty.\"    \"Had I my way,\" answered the Fool-Killer, \"my blade would always drip.  It is my master, yonder, who thwarts my duty.\"  And he nodded toward  King Terribus.    \"Then you should exercise your right on him, and cleave the ugly head  from his shoulders,\" declared the prince.    \"Nay, unless I interfered with the Fool-Killer,\" said the king, \"I  should soon have no subjects left to rule; for at one time or another  they all deserve the blade.\"    \"Why, that may be true enough,\" replied Prince Marvel.  \"But I think,  under such circumstances, your Fool-Killer is a needless servant.  So I  will rid you of him in a few moments.\"    With that he whipped out his sword and stood calmly confronting the  Fool-Killer, whose grave face never changed in expression as he  advanced menacingly upon his intended victim.  The blades clashed  together, and that of the Fool-Killer broke short off at the hilt.  He  took a step backward, stumbled and fell prone upon the rocky floor,  while Prince Marvel sprang forward and pressed the point of his sword  against his opponent's breast.    \"Hold!\" cried the king, starting to his feet.  \"Would you slay my  Fool-Killer?  Think of the harm you would do the world!\"    \"But he is laggard and unfaithful to his calling!\" answered the prince,  sternly.    \"Nevertheless, if he remove but one fool a year he is a benefit to  mankind,\" declared the king.  \"Release him, I pray you!\"    Then the victor withdrew his sword and stood aside, while the  Fool-Killer slowly got upon his feet and bowed humbly before the king.    \"Go!\" shouted Terribus, his eye flashing angrily.  \"You have humiliated  me before my enemy.  As an atonement see that you kill me a fool a day  for sixty days.\"    Hearing this command, many of the people about the throne began to  tremble; but the king paid no attention to their fears, and the  Fool-Killer bowed again before his master and withdrew from the chamber.        9.  The Royal Dragon of Spor    \"Now,\" said Terribus, regarding the prince gloomily, \"I must dispose of  you in another way.\"    For a moment he dropped his scarlet head in thought.  Then he turned  fiercely upon his attendants.    \"Let the Wrestler come forward!\" he shouted, as loudly as his mild  voice would carry.    Instantly a tall blackamoor advanced from the throng and cast off his  flowing robe, showing a strong figure clad only in a silver loincloth.    \"Crack me this fellow's bones!\" commanded Terribus.    \"I beg your Majesty will not compel me to touch him,\" said Prince  Marvel, with a slight shudder; \"for his skin is greasy, and will soil  my hands.  Here, Nerle!\" he continued, turning to his esquire, \"dispose  of this black man, and save me the trouble.\"    Nerle laughed pleasantly.  The black was a powerfully built man, and  compared with Nerle and the prince, who had but the stature of boys, he  towered like a very giant in size.  Nevertheless, Nerle did not  hesitate to spring upon the Wrestler, who with a quick movement sent  the boy crashing against the stone pavement.    Nerle was much bruised by the fall, and as he painfully raised himself  to his feet a great lump was swelling behind his left ear, where his  head had struck the floor, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#7)"],[1,"the  libraries' governing boards and with representatives from the  community, and may be the result of public hearings, discussions  and other input.  Although many librarians use selection aids, such as review  journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the quality of  potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegate their  selection decisions to parties outside of the public library or  its governing body.  One limited exception is the use of third-  party vendors or approval plans to acquire print and video  resources.  In such arrangements, third-party vendors provide  materials based on the library's description of its collection  development criteria.  The vendor sends materials to the library,  and the library retains the materials that meet its collection  development needs and returns the materials that do not.  Even in  this arrangement, however, the librarians still retain ultimate  control over their collection development and review all of the  materials that enter their library's collection.  2.        The Internet in Public Libraries      The vast majority of public libraries offer Internet access  to their patrons.  According to a recent report by the U.S.  National Commission on Libraries and Information Science,  approximately 95% of all public libraries provide public access  to the Internet.  John C. Bertot & Charles R. McClure, Public  Libraries and the Internet 2000: Summary Findings and Data  Tables, Report to National Commission on Libraries and  Information Science, at 3.  The Internet vastly expands the  amount of information available to patrons of public libraries.  The widespread availability of Internet access in public  libraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding,  including state and local funding and the federal funding  programs regulated by CIPA.  Many libraries face a large amount of patron demand for  their Internet services.  At some libraries, patron demand for  Internet access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer  terminals with access to the Internet.  These libraries use sign-  in and time limit procedures and/or establish rules regarding the  allowable uses of the terminals, in an effort to ration their  computer resources.  For example, some of the libraries whose  librarians testified at trial prohibit the use of email and chat  functions on their public Internet terminals.  Public libraries play an important role in providing  Internet access to citizens who would not otherwise possess it.  Of the 143 million Americans using the Internet, approximately  10%, or 14.3 million people, access the Internet at a public  library.   Internet access at public libraries is more often used  by those with lower incomes than those with higher incomes.  About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of  less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet  access.  Approximately 70% of libraries serving communities with  poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts.  1.        Internet Use Policies in Public Libraries      Approximately 95% of libraries with public Internet access  have some form of \"acceptable use\" policy or \"Internet use\"  policy governing patrons' use of the Internet.  These policies  set forth the conditions under which patrons are permitted to  access and use the library's Internet resources.  These policies  vary widely.  Some of the less restrictive policies, like those  held by Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver Regional  Library, do not prohibit adult patrons from viewing sexually  explicit materials on the Web, as long as they do so at terminals  with privacy screens or recessed monitors, which are designed to  prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are  viewing, and as long as it does not violate state or federal law  to do so.  Other libraries prohibit their patrons from viewing  all \"sexually explicit\" or \"sexually graphic\" materials.  Some libraries prohibit the viewing of materials that are  not necessarily sexual, such as Web pages that are \"harmful to  minors,\" \"offensive to the public,\" \"objectionable,\" \"racially  offensive,\" or simply \"inappropriate.\"  Other libraries restrict  access to Web sites that the library just does not want to  provide, even though the sites are not necessarily offensive.  For example, the Fulton County Public Library restricts access to  the Web sites of dating services.  Similarly, the Tacoma Public  Library's policy does not allow patrons to use the library's  Internet terminals for personal email, for online chat, or for  playing games.  In some cases, libraries instituted Internet use policies  after having experienced specific problems, whereas in other  cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policies and  regulatory measures (such as using filtering software) before  ever offering public Internet access.  Essentially four interests  motivate libraries to institute Internet use policies and to  apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons' use  of the Internet.      First, libraries have sought to protect patrons (especially  children) and staff members from accidentally viewing sexually  explicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemed  harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet.  For  example, some librarians who testified described situations in  which patrons left sexually explicit images minimized on an  Internet terminal so that the next patron would see them when  they began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually  explicit images from a Web site and left them at a public  printer.  Second, libraries have attempted to protect patrons from  unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they do not  wish to see while they are using the Internet.  For example, the  Memphis-Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet use  policy states that the library \"employs filtering technology to  reduce the possibility that customers may encounter objectionable  content in the form of depictions of full nudity and sexual  acts.\"      Third, libraries have sought to keep patrons (again,  especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually  explicit materials or other materials that the library deems  inappropriate.  For example, a study of the Tacoma Public  Library's Internet use logs for the year 2000 showed that users  between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filter  blocks that occurred on library computers.  The study, which we  credit, concluded that children and young teens were actively  seeking to access sexually explicit images in the library.  The  Greenville Library's Board of Directors was particularly  concerned that patrons were accessing obscene materials in the  public library in violation of South Carolina's obscenity  statute.  Finally, some libraries have regulated patrons' Internet use  to attempt to control patrons' inappropriate (or illegal)  behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pages that  contain sexually explicit materials or content that is otherwise  deemed unacceptable.  We recognize the concerns that led several of the public  libraries whose librarians and board members testified in this  case to start using Internet filtering software.  The testimony  of the Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is  illustrative.  In December 1999, there was considerable local  press coverage in Greenville concerning adult patrons who  routinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography.  In  response to public outcry stemming from the newspaper report, the  Board of Trustees held a special board meeting to obtain  information and to communicate with the public concerning the  library's provision of Internet access.  At this meeting, the  Board learned for the first time of complaints about children  being exposed to pornography that was displayed on the library's  Internet terminals.      In late January to early February of 2000, the library  installed privacy screens and recessed terminals in an effort to  restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the  library.  In February, 2000, the Board informed the library staff  that they were expected to be familiar with the South Carolina  obscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition on access  to obscene materials, child pornography, or other materials  prohibited under applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Staff were told that they were to enforce the policy by means of  a \"tap on the shoulder.\"  Prior to adopting its current Internet  Use Policy, the Board adopted an \"Addendum to Current Internet  Use Policy.\"  Under the policy, the Board temporarily instituted  a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reduced  substantially the number of computers with Internet access in the  library; reconfigured the location of the computers so that  librarians had visual contact with all Internet-accessible  terminals; and removed the privacy screens from terminals with  Internet access.  Even after the Board implemented the privacy screens and  later the \"tap-on-the-shoulder\" policy combined with placing  terminals in view of librarians, the library experienced a high  turnover rate among reference librarians who worked in view of  Internet terminals.  Finding that the policies that it had tried  did not prevent the viewing of sexually explicit materials in the  library, the Board at one point considered discontinuing Internet  access in the library.  The Board finally concluded that the  methods that it had used to regulate Internet use were not  sufficient to stem the behavioral problems that it thought were  linked to the availability of pornographic materials in the  library.  As a result, it implemented a mandatory filtering  policy.      We note, however, that none of the libraries proffered by  the defendants presented any systematic records or quantitative  comparison of the amount of criminal"]]]
