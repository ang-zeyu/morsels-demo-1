[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41017"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 5 (of 8) (#7)"],[1," our presence in       the position occupied by us was a surprise to them. The Mounted       Infantry actually dismounted to prepare for business, when       fortunately a mutual recognition took place, and a hearty       greeting to the brave fellows who were to bear the brunt of the       coming action was extended by our force. Captain Casson (one of       the first to fall at Mosterts Hock) commanded the new-comers.       After a night's rest, we started again on the march, which       continued without event till Tuesday, 3rd, when our scouts at       11.30 came back with the news that the enemy were upon us,       making for two kopjes in front of us. Both of these were       immediately crowned by our little force of 440--the       above-mentioned Mounted Infantry, with some of the Royal Irish       Rifles taking the northern kopje, and the remainder of the       Royal Irish Rifles that to the south. Rifle firing opened at       once, and gradually grew hotter till about 2 P.M., when the       Boers opened with artillery, four guns being brought into play       in positions that enabled them to sweep our two lines.       Fortunately, the firing was most erratic, and little or no       damage was done by the shells. Volley fire from the Royal Irish       Rifles soon put one of the guns out of action. We had no       artillery, and the wonder is that we held the position,       extended as it was far beyond what seemed tenable to so small a       force, for the long time we did. The bearers of C Company, Cape       Medical Staff Corps, had a particularly warm time of it. Sent       as they were at the commencement of the action right on to the       fighting line, they stuck to their posts till the very last       without any cover, and only retired with the last line of       straggling defenders, who worked their way back through a       deadly hail of bullets, explosive and otherwise, to their own       camp, after the Boers had won the day. The first day's fight       lasted till darkness, when we tried to snatch some rest--a       luxury that came to few. Next morning at 5.30 found us sniping       at one another prior to the forenoon fire that soon kept every       one busy at all points. At 8 the artillery commenced firing,       and the fight became fiercer till about 9, when our men on the       north kopje, unable to contend against the fearful odds,       hoisted the white flag, and the Boers on that side rushed the       position, and were thus able to pour a murderous fire into the       unfortunate Royal Irish Rifles on the southern height, who,       while their attention was riveted on the enemy on their front,       were in ignorance of what was going on in their rear for a       while. When they turned to reply to the rear attack, their       position was taken, and the poor fellows, accompanied by nine       of the stretcher-bearers, had to run for the hospital, distant       600 yards, under a fearful cross-fire. Several of the Rifles       were killed, but the bearers escaped marvellously. The       hospital, which was pitched between the two kopjes, suffered       from the shelling, and was in itself dangerous; while, to add       to the risk, a trench thrown up to protect the sick was       mistaken by the Boers for a rifle-trench, and became a mark for       their special attention. One shell burst near the       operating-tent while the surgeons were at work on a wounded       man, and riddled the tent, fortunately hitting no one. Another       banged into a buck waggon. A third cut a mule in halves. A       slight bruise on the knee was the only hurt suffered by any of       the Hospital Corps. Our dead numbered ten, whom we buried on       the battle-field, placing over the grave a neatly dressed and       lettered stone, executed by Private Buckland, C Medical Staff       Corps. Two of the wounded died afterwards in the temporary       hospital at Reddersburg, and are buried in the cemetery there.       The wounded, thirty-two in number, were sent down from Bethanie       to one of the base hospitals, for treatment in the convalescent       stage. Enough praise cannot be given to the warm-hearted people       of the Dutch village of Reddersburg. It mattered not that we       were British. Their all was placed at our disposal, and to       their generosity much of our success with the wounded is to be       attributed.\"    The casualties were as follows:--         _Killed_--Captain F. G. Casson, Northumberland Fusiliers; 2nd       Lieut. C. R. Barclay, Northumberland Fusiliers. _Dangerously       Wounded_--Captain W. P. Dimsdale, Royal Irish Rifles. _Slightly       Wounded_--Lieut. E. C. Bradford, Royal Irish Rifles.       _Captured_--Captain Tennant, Royal Artillery; 2nd Lieut.       Butler, Durham Light Infantry, attached to Northumberland       Fusiliers; Captain W. J. McWhinnie, Royal Irish Rifles; Captain       A. C. D. Spencer, Royal Irish Rifles; Captain Kelly, Royal       Irish Rifles; 2nd Lieut. E. H. Saunders, Royal Irish Rifles;       2nd Lieut. Bowen-Colthurst, Royal Irish Rifles; 2nd Lieut.       Soutry, Royal Irish Rifles, and all remaining rank and file.    Lieut. Stacpole (Northumberland Fusiliers) was also wounded on the 4th.  He was riding for reinforcements, and as he approached Reddersburg,  unknowing the place was in the hands of the Boers, he was greeted with  shots which killed his horse, wounded him, and placed him at the mercy  of the enemy, by whom he was captured. The Boers in their retreat,  however, left their prisoners behind. The total of killed and wounded  numbered between 50 and 150. The strength of the British was 167 mounted  infantry, 424 infantry. The enemy were said to be 3200 strong.    The unlucky termination of the affair completed the eastern flanking  movement of the Boers, who were now trickling over the country from  Sanna's Post on the south to a point east of Jagersfontein road. They  soon held the Free State east of the railway beyond Bethulie, and  considerable numbers went south towards Smithfield and Rouxville, their  determination, after their recent successes, being to harass the British  force as much as possible. It was now becoming evident that all the  present trouble was due to over-leniency, and it began to be urged that  some measures must be adopted which would ensure for the conquerors of  the enemy's country the respect that was due to them. The humanitarian  attitude of Lord Roberts had produced an unlooked-for result. The  Commander-in-Chief had attempted to administer justice for a  seventeenth-century people on the ethics of those of the nineteenth, and  the experiment had proved disastrous. The enemy, far from being  impressed by the show of magnanimity, was laughing in his sleeve at his  immunity from pains and penalties. Our troops were forced now to move in  a country where nearly every man was a foe or a spy, and one who,  moreover, thought meanly of us for the concessions which had been made.  As an instance of contrast between our own and the Dutchman's mode of  dealing with those considered as rebels, an instructive story was told.  A Free State burgher at the outset of hostilities entered the Imperial  service as a conductor of transport. It was a non-combatant's  occupation, and one for which he was fitted, owing to his knowledge of  the Kaffir and Dutch languages. This man was captured by the Boers, who,  declaring him to be a rebel, instantly shot him dead. We, on the other  hand, accepted an obsolete rifle, a flint-lock elephant gun belonging to  the days of the Great Trek perhaps, as a peace-offering and then told  the rebel to go away and turn over a new leaf. His new leaf resolved  itself into unearthing Mausers and Martinis, and popping at us from the  first convenient kopje--if not from the windows of his farm!    To this cause may be attributed the sudden return of so-called ill-luck,  which seemed epidemic. April had brought with it an alarming list of  losses at Sanna's Post, which was followed by a grievous total of  killed, wounded, and missing--five companies lost to us--at Reddersburg.  We had, moreover, disquieting days around Thabanchu, Ladybrand, and  Rouxville, and were being forced gradually, and not always gracefully,  to retreat. For instance, in the retirement from Rouxville, four  companies of the Royal Irish, some Queenstown and Kaffrarian Rifles, had  merely escaped by what in vulgar phrase we term \"the skin of their  teeth.\" It was merely owing to the smartness of General Brabant, who  sent two squadrons of Border Horse from Aliwal North to the rescue, that  the small force escaped being cut off. This officer's little band  garrisoning Wepener was meanwhile beginning to test the Boer force in  earnest.      THE ESCAPE OF PRISONERS FROM PRETORIA    At this time great excitement prevailed owing to the escape from  Pretoria of Captain Haldane, D.S.O. (Gordon Highlanders), who was  captured after the disaster to the armoured train at Chieveley; of  Lieutenant Le Mesurier (Dublin Fusiliers), who was taken prisoner with  Colonel Moeller's force after the battle of Glencoe; and of Sergeant  Brockie, a Colonial volunteer. These officers had a more adventurous  task than even that of Mr. Churchill, for since the war correspondent's  escape the Boers had naturally taken additional precautions, and had  mounted extra guard over their prisoners. The officers most ingeniously  contrived to dig a trench underneath the floor of the prison, and here  they hid themselves. For eighteen long days they remained cramped in  this small underground hole, in the daily expectation that the other  officers and their guards were about to be transferred to new quarters,  when a chance of escape would be offered.    Captain Haldane gave exciting details of his adventures in _Blackwood's  Magazine_; but, before dealing with them, it is interesting to consider  the position of the vast congregation of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],[0,"The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#7)"],[1," my name, saying, \"To what end lovest thou this  lady, seeing that thou canst not support her presence? Now tell us this  thing, that we may know it: for certainly the end of such a love must  be worthy of knowledge.\" And when she had spoken these words, not she  only, but all they that were with her, began to observe me, waiting  for my reply. Whereupon I said thus unto them:--\"Ladies, the end and  aim of my Love was but the salutation of that lady of whom I conceive  that ye are speaking; wherein alone I found that beatitude which is  the goal of desire. And now that it hath pleased her to deny me this,  Love, my Master, of his great goodness, hath placed all my beatitude  there where my hope will not fail me.\" Then those ladies began to talk  closely together; and as I have seen snow fall among the rain, so was  their talk mingled with sighs. But after a little, that lady who had  been the first to address me, addressed me again in these words: \"We  pray thee that thou wilt tell us wherein abideth this thy beatitude.\"  And answering, I said but thus much: \"In those words that do praise my  lady.\" To the which she rejoined: \"If thy speech were true, those words  that thou didst write concerning thy condition would have been written  with another intent.\"    Then I, being almost put to shame because of her answer, went out  from among them; and as I walked, I said within myself: \"Seeing that  there is so much beatitude in those words which do praise my lady,  wherefore hath my speech of her been different?\" And then I resolved  that thenceforward I would choose for the theme of my writings only the  praise of this most gracious being. But when I had thought exceedingly,  it seemed to me that I had taken to myself a theme which was much  too lofty, so that I dared not begin; and I remained during several  days in the desire of speaking, and the fear of beginning. After  which it happened, as I passed one day along a path which lay beside  a stream of very clear water, that there came upon me a great desire  to say somewhat in rhyme: but when I began thinking how I should say  it, methought that to speak of her were unseemly, unless I spoke to  other ladies in the second person; which is to say, not to _any_ other  ladies, but only to such as are so called because they are gentle, let  alone for mere womanhood. Whereupon I declare that my tongue spake as  though by its own impulse, and said, \"Ladies that have intelligence in  love.\" These words I laid up in my mind with great gladness, conceiving  to take them as my commencement. Wherefore, having returned to the city  I spake of, and considered thereof during certain days, I began a poem  with this beginning, constructed in the mode which will be seen below  in its division. The poem begins here:--        Ladies that have intelligence in love,        Of mine own lady I would speak with you;        Not that I hope to count her praises through,          But telling what I may, to ease my mind.      And I declare that when I speak thereof,      Love sheds such perfect sweetness over me      That if my courage failed not, certainly          To him my listeners must be all resign'd.          Wherefore I will not speak in such large kind      That mine own speech should foil me, which were base;      But only will discourse of her high grace          In these poor words, the best that I can find,      With you alone, dear dames and damozels:      'Twere ill to speak thereof with any else.        An Angel, of his blessed knowledge, saith        To God: \"Lord, in the world that Thou hast made,        A miracle in action is display'd,          By reason of a soul whose splendours fare      Even hither: and since Heaven requireth      Nought saving her, for her it prayeth Thee,      Thy Saints crying aloud continually.\"          Yet Pity still defends our earthly share          In that sweet soul; God answering thus the prayer:      \"My well-beloved, suffer that in peace      Your hope remain, while so My pleasure is,          There where one dwells who dreads the loss of her:      And who in Hell unto the doomed shall say,      'I have looked on that for which God's chosen pray.'\"        My lady is desired in the high Heaven:        _Wherefore_, it now behoveth me to tell,        Saying: Let any maid that would be well          Esteemed keep with her: for as she goes by,      Into foul hearts a deathly chill is driven      By Love, that makes ill thought to perish there:      While any who endures to gaze on her          Must either be ennobled, or else die.          When one deserving to be raised so high      Is found, 'tis then her power attains its proof,      Making his heart strong for his soul's behoof          With the full strength of meek humility.      Also this virtue owns she, by God's will:      Who speaks with her can never come to ill.        Love saith concerning her: \"How chanceth it        That flesh, which is of dust, should be thus pure?\"        Then, gazing always, he makes oath: \"Forsure,          This is a creature of God till now unknown.\"      She hath that paleness of the pearl that's fit      In a fair woman, so much and not more;      She is as high as Nature's skill can soar;          Beauty is tried by her comparison.          Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon,      Spirits of love do issue thence in flame,      Which through their eyes who then may look on them          Pierce to the heart's deep chamber every one.      And in her smile Love's image you may see;      Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly.        Dear Song, I know thou wilt hold gentle speech        With many ladies, when I send thee forth:        Wherefore (being mindful that thou hadst thy birth          From Love, and art a modest, simple child),      Whomso thou meetest, say thou this to each:      \"Give me good speed! To her I wend along      In whose much strength my weakness is made strong.\"          And if, i' the end, thou wouldst not be beguiled          Of all thy labour, seek not the defiled      And common sort; but rather choose to be      Where man and woman dwell in courtesy.          So to the road thou shalt be reconciled,      And find the lady, and with the lady, Love.      Commend thou me to each, as doth behove.    _This poem, that it may be better understood, I will divide more  subtly than the others preceding; and therefore I will make three  parts of it. The first part is a proem to the words following. The  second is the matter treated of. The third is, as it were, a handmaid  to the preceding words. The second begins here, \"An Angel;\" the third  here, \"Dear Song, I know.\" The first part is divided into four. In  the first, I say to whom I mean to speak of my lady, and wherefore I  will so speak. In the second, I say what she appears to myself to be  when I reflect upon her excellence, and what I would utter if I lost  not courage. In the third, I say what it is I purpose to speak so as  not to be impeded by faintheartedness. In the fourth, repeating to  whom I purpose speaking, I tell the reason why I speak to them. The  second begins here, \"And I declare;\" the third here, \"Wherefore I will  not speak;\" the fourth here, \"With you alone.\" Then, when I say \"An  Angel,\" I begin treating of this lady: and this part is divided into  two. In the first, I tell what is understood of her in heaven. In the  second, I tell what is understood of her on earth: here, \"My lady is  desired.\" This second part is divided into two; for, in the first, I  speak of her as regards the nobleness of her soul, relating some of  her virtues proceeding from her soul; in the second, I speak of her  as regards the nobleness of her body, narrating some of her beauties:  here, \"Love saith concerning her.\" This second part is divided into  two, for, in the first, I speak of certain beauties which belong to  the whole person; in the second, I speak of certain beauties which  belong to a distinct part of the person: here, \"Whatever her sweet  eyes.\" This second part is divided into two; for, in the one, I speak  of the eyes, which are the beginning of love; in the second, I speak  of the mouth, which is the end of love. And that every vicious thought  may be discarded herefrom, let the reader remember that it is above  written that the greeting of this lady, which was an act of her mouth,  was the goal of my desires, while I could receive it. Then, when I say,  \"Dear Song, I know,\" I add a stanza as it were handmaid to the others,  wherein I say what I desire from this my poem. And because this last  part is easy to understand, I trouble not myself with more divisions.  I say, indeed, that the further to open the meaning of this poem, more  minute divisions ought to be used; but nevertheless he who is not of  wit enough to understand it by these which have been already made is  welcome to leave it alone; for certes, I fear I have communicated its  sense to too many by these present divisions, if it so happened that  many should hear it._    When this song was a little gone abroad, a certain one of my friends,  hearing the same, was pleased to question me, that I should tell him  what thing love is; it may be, conceiving from the words thus heard  a hope of me beyond my desert. Wherefore I, thinking that after such  discourse it were well to say somewhat of the nature of Love, and also  in accordance with my friend's desire, proposed to myself to write  certain words in the which I should treat of this argument. And the  sonnet that I then made is this:--        Love and the gentle heart are one same thing,        Even as the wise man[20] in his ditty saith:        Each, of itself, would be such life in death      As rational soul bereft of reasoning.      'Tis Nature makes them when she loves: a king        Love is, whose palace where he sojourneth        Is called the Heart; there draws he quiet breath      At first, with brief or longer slumbering.      Then beauty "]]]
