There are only three doctors to each large city, and they  are subsidised by government or the town councils, because there  are not enough sick people from whom they could make a living as  of yore. The good health of the public is also in some measure  due to the fact of our scientific men having been able, since a  few years past, to gain a good deal of control over the weather.  By means of captive balloons, currents of electricity between  the higher atmosphere and the earth are kept passing regularly.  By other electrical contrivances as well as these, rain can now  be nearly always made to come at night and can be prevented from  falling during the day. Hurricanes and desolating storms are  also held very much under control.    Our contrasts are now drawing to a close. Enough has been said to  make it plain to the slowest intellect among us, what is gained  by having been born in the twentieth century, instead of in the  nineteenth, and by being born a Canadian, instead of to any other  land. There can hardly be to-day such a woeful creature as a  Canadian who does not realise and is not proud of the grandeur of  his heritage. Our race, owing to the splendid hygienic and social  conditions that have been dilated upon, is one of the healthiest  and strongest on the face of the earth. We are not demoralized  or effeminated by the luxury and abundance which are ours, but  elevated rather, and strengthened by the very magnificence and  opulence of our circumstances, and by the perfect freedom, under  healthful restraint, which we enjoy through the community's  strong, vigorous, moral and intellectual tone.    As there is nothing more wonderful about the present age, or more  characteristic of the times, than our mode of travelling, these  few pages shall be concluded with a plan of a very simple journey,  a journey which can be strongly recommended to all who are wishing  for change of scene and are somewhat bewildered in choosing a  route among the innumerable places in the world which have claims  on their attention. We will imagine that a party of twenty has  been made up, and that the start is from Halifax, the direction  eastward, and the destination Constantinople. The car which is  timed to start at 7 a.m., is standing at rest on the sloping side,  while the passengers, say fifty in number, are taking their seats  in the luxurious chamber within. The first stop is at Sydney,  Cape Breton, and the car is pointed accurately in that direction.  At three minutes to 7 the engineers and conductor come on board;  the former to place the powerful oxyhydrogen charge in the great  breech-loading tube, the latter to close the doors against ingress  or egress. Precisely at 7 the signal is given. A furious and  powerful hissing is then heard, as well as a momentary scraping of  the car on its runners. In another second she is high in the air,  and already Halifax has nearly receded from the engineer's sight.  The rate of a mile in three seconds is kept up till Sydney rapidly  appears in view. In the next few seconds the engineer exerts his  skill and the car lands gracefully on the slide, still in brisk  motion. After a little scraping and crunching on the runners,  she pulls up at the station platform at the bottom of the decline,  ten minutes only after leaving Halifax. The next spring is made  to St. John's, Newfoundland, which is reached in fourteen minutes.  Here a few minutes are taken up in pointing the car accurately  for Galway. Great caution is necessary, and very delicate and  beautiful instruments are employed. When all are on board again  and ready for the supermarine voyage, the engineer loads up with  a much more powerful charge than before. He prepares at the start  for a speed of a mile in three seconds, then, when fairly out  over the sea, a stronger electric current is applied to the huge  charge, and a speed of a mile, or even more, a second is obtained.  This fearful velocity is not permitted overland, for fear of  collisions, as car routes cross each other. But no routes cross  over the sea between St. John's and Galway, nor is the Galway car  allowed to leave till the St. John's car has arrived, and vice  versa, therefore the highest speed attainable is permitted. Before  land again looms in view, speed is much slackened, and now the  engineer requires all his experience and his utmost skill. The  high winds across the ocean may have caused his car to deviate  slightly from its path, so as soon as land appears the deviation  has to be corrected, and only two or three seconds remain in which  to correct it. However, the engineer is equal to his task, and  the car is now in the same manner as before, brought to a stand  in Galway at 6 minutes to 8, just 30 minutes out from St. John's  and 54 from Halifax. At 8 o'clock Dublin is reached, next comes  Holyhead, and then London at 8.20. Here passengers for the South  of Europe change cars. As the car for the South does not start  till 8.30, there is time for a hasty glance at the enormous  central depot just arrived at--one of the wonders of the world.  Cars are coming in every minute punctually on time from all parts  of the country and the world. The arrival slide is here shaped  like the inside or concavity of a shallow cone, two miles in  diameter, with the edge rather more than 150 feet from the ground.  In the centre, where the cars stop, is a hydraulic elevator, by  which they are immediately let down below to make room for the  next arrival. The passengers are then disembarked without hurry.  Those who are to continue their journey then go on board their  right car and are again started on time. The departure slide is  like a lower storey of the arrival one. It is immediately beneath  it, but its grade is not quite parallel. Near the centre, where  the cars start, the upper slide is twenty-five feet above the  lower one, but at the edge, a mile distant, in consequence of the  difference in grade, there is fifty feet between them. The path of  the cars before they emerge from the departure slide, is between  the supports of the upper one, yet the supports are so placed that  the cars can be pointed before starting for all the principal  routes. There is a through car to Constantinople, and in it the  twenty passengers from Halifax take their seats. At 8.30 the  first spring is made, and Paris is reached in 10 minutes.  Another spring, and in 10 minutes more Strasbourg appears. Then  successively: Munich in 8 minutes, Vienna in 10, Belgrade in 15,  and lastly Constantinople in 20, or at 9.43, that is just one hour  and thirteen minutes from leaving London, and two hours and 43  minutes from Halifax. It is still early in the day--well that is  where a surprise awaits the traveller who has not considered that  he has been journeying eastward through more than ninety degrees  of longitude, so that instead of being a quarter to ten in the  morning, it is a good six hours later, or just about four in the  afternoon. Two out of the twenty Haligonians are on business only,  and intend to return the same night; the other eighteen, after  seeing the lions of Constantinople intend visiting Jerusalem, the  Persian Gulf, Bombay, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Pekin, and Yokohama,  staying a day or two in each city. The car services on this route  have been in existence a good many years and are well organized.  From Yokohama a long flight over the Pacific will be taken and  Canadian soil again struck at Victoria. We will not follow the  eighteen travellers in their eight or ten days sight-seeing, but  will return to the two Haligonians at Constantinople, who have got  through their business in a few hours, and must go back to Halifax  at once. They start for London at 10 p.m., Constantinople time,  arriving there in one hour and thirteen minutes over the route  they traversed in the morning. They change cars, and in ten  minutes are off again via Holyhead, Dublin, Galway, St. John's  and Sydney, C. B., for Halifax, where they arrive in one hour and  20 minutes from London, or forty-three minutes after midnight by  Constantinople time, but more than six hours earlier, or about  6.30 in the evening by Halifax time. They have therefore got ahead  of the sun in his apparent journey round the world, for he had  set for at least two hours when they started from Constantinople,  but they caught up with him when over the Atlantic, and to the  engineer it appeared as if he were rising in the west. This is  a daily experience of travellers going west, which never fails  at first to create great surprise. Our two voyagers are now safe  back, at the port from which they set out a little less than  twelve hours before. They are quite accustomed to such travelling,  and have done nothing but what thousands are doing daily. But what  would have been thought, if such a journey had been described  a hundred years ago, in 1883? And how will the world travel a  hundred years hence, in 2083? It is hard to say, or even to  imagine. Yet inventive skill is unceasingly active, and in all  probability speed will eventually be still further accelerated.    And now our task of contrasting Canada in 1983 with Canada in 1883  is concluded, and surely in this epitome of the works of a century  there is food for reflection for the inventor, the statesman,  the moralist and the philanthropist. All, when pondering on  the gradual, but sure improvement that has come about in their  respective paths, can take heart and nerve themselves for renewed  effort, or be induced to stand firm till success comes to reward  their courage. No man can despair who ponders on the position of  the Dominion in 1983."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#7)"],[1,"of their way and eschewed  their vocation of piracy and devoted their energies to commerce and the  spreading of the Gospel of Christ.    Piously they decorated the sails of their crafts and blazoned their war  shields with the sign of the cross. They kidnapped holy priests (for  otherwise they came not), and taking them aboard their ships, they  sailed to their several ports. Then they forced the unwilling Fathers  to unite them in holy wedlock to the maidens of their choice. To many  havens they sailed, and in every one they had an only wife. They made  their priests inscribe texts from the holy Gospel on pieces of  parchment made from the skin of hogs, and instead of robbing people, as  of yore, they paid with the word of Holy Scripture for the booty they  levied. This, they said, was infinitely more precious than any worldly  dross. All hail to the memory of my gallant maternal ancestor, who,  when surfeited with the caresses of his Fifine of Normandy, flew to the  arms of Mercedes of Andalusia. Next, perhaps, he appeared in Greenland,  blubbering with an Esquimau heiress. Anon, you might have found him in  Columbia in the tolls of a princely Pocahontas. In Mexico he ate the  ardent chile from the tender hand of his Guadalupita, and later on he  was on time at a five o'clock family tea party in Japan, or he might  have kotowed pidgin-love to a trusting maid in a China town of fair  Cathay. In Africa--oh, horror!--here I draw the veil, for in my mind's  eye I behold a burly negro (yes, sah!) staring at me out of fishy, blue  eyes. It is said of these gallant rovers of the seas that they were  subject to a peculiar malady when on shore. It caused them to stagger  and swagger, use violent language, and deport themselves not unlike  people who are seized with mal de mer, or sickness of the sea. When  attacked by this failing, their wives would cast them bodily into the  holds of their ships and start them out to sea, where they soon  recovered their usual health and equilibrium and continued on their  rounds. They were the first of all commercial travelers and the  hardiest, jolliest and most prosperous--but they did not hoard their  earnings.    My uncle conducted a store, selling merchandise of every description.  Dutch uncle though he was to me, I must give him thanks for the careful  business training he bestowed on me. I say with pride that I proved to  be his most apt and willing pupil. He taught me how the natives, by  nature simple-minded and unsophisticated, had lost all confidence in  their fellow-men in general and merchants in particular through the, to  say the least, very dubious and suspicious dealings of the tribes of  Israel. My uncle said he was an old timer in New Mexico, but the Jew  was there already when he came and, added he, thoughtfully, \"I believe  the Jews came to America with Columbus.\" With a pack of merchandise  strapped to his back, this king of commerce crossed the plains in the  face of murderous Indians and with the unexplainable, crafty cunning of  his race, he sold tobacco and trinkets to the warriors who had set out  to kill him, and to the squaws he sold Parisian lingerie at a bargain.  He swore that he was losing money and selling the goods below cost, not  counting the freight.    As the Indians had no money and nothing else of commercial value to  him, he bartered for the trophies of victory which the proud chiefs  carried suspended from their belts. Deprecatingly he called their  attention to the undeniable fact that these articles had been worn  before and had to be rated as second-hand goods. But he hoped that his  brother-in-law, Isaac Dreibein, who conducted a second-hand  hairdressing establishment in New York City, would take these goods off  his hands. This trade flourished for a time, until, as usual, Israel  fell off from the Lord, by opening shop on the Sabbath. An unlucky  Moses got into a fatal altercation with a Comanche chief, whom he  cheated out of a scalplock, as he was as baldheaded as a hen's egg.  Thereat the Indians became suspicious and refused to trade with the  Jews ever after.    With proverbial German thoroughness, uncle instructed me in all the  tricks and secrets of his profession. He had found that the Mexicans  were good buyers, if handled scientifically, for they would never leave  the store until they had spent all their money. Therefore, in order to  encourage our customers, we kept a barrel of firewater under the  counter as a trade starter. One or more drams of old Magnolia would  start the ball to roll finely. Our merchandise cost mark was made up  from the words, \"God help us!\" Every letter of this pious sentiment  designated one of the numbers from one to nine and a cross stood for  naught. When I said to uncle, \"No wonder that our business prospers  under this mark--God help us!--but say, who helps our customers?\" he  was nonplussed for a moment, and then he laughed heartily and said that  this had never worried him yet.    There was not much money in circulation in New Mexico at that time, as  the country was without railroads and too isolated to market farm  produce, wool and hides profitably. Mining for gold was carried on at  Pinos Altos, near the southern boundary, but the Apaches did not  encourage prospecting to any extent. During the period of the discovery  of gold in California, in the days of \"forty-nine,\" the people of New  Mexico had become quite wealthy through supplying the California placer  miners with mutton sheep at the price of an ounce of gold dust per  head, when muttons cost half a dollar on the Rio Grande. At that rate  of profit they could afford the time and expense of driving their herds  of sheep to market at Los Angeles, even though the Apaches of Arizona  took their toll and fattened on stolen mutton.          CHAPTER VI.    INDIAN LORE. THE WILY NAVAJO      The principal source of the money supply was the United States  Government, which maintained many forts and army posts in the  Territories as a safeguard against the Apache and Navajo Indians.  During the Civil War, the Navajo Indians broke out and raided the  Mexican settlements along the Rio Grande and committed many outrages  and thefts. The Government gave these Indians the surprise of their  lives. An army detachment of United States California volunteers  swooped suddenly down on the Navajos and surprised and conquered them  in the strongholds of their own country. The whole tribe was forced to  surrender, was disarmed, and transported to Fort Stanton by the  Government.    This military reservation lies on the eastern boundary of New Mexico,  on the edge of the staked plains of Texas. Here the Navajos were kept  in mortal terror of their hereditary enemies, the Comanche Indians, for  several years, and they were so thoroughly cowed and subdued by this  stratagem that they were good and peacable ever after. The Government  allowed them to reoccupy their native haunts and granted them a  reservation of seventy-five miles square. These Indians are blood  relatives to the savage Apaches. They speak the same language, as they  are also of Mongolian origin. They came originally from Asia in an  unexplained manner and over an unknown route. They have always been the  enemies of the Pueblo Indians, who are descendants of the Toltec and  Aztec races. Unlike the Pueblo Indians, who live in villages and  maintain themselves with agricultural pursuits, the Navajos are nomads  and born herdsmen.    The Navajo tribe is quite wealthy now, as they possess many thousands  of sheep and goats, and they are famed for their quaint and beautiful  blankets and homespun, which they weave on their hand looms from the  wool of their sheep. They owned large herds of horses, beautiful  ponies, a crossed breed of mustangs and Mormon stock, which latter they  had stolen in their raids on the Mormon settlements in Utah. As saddle  horses, these ponies are unexcelled for endurance under rough service.    Mentally the Navajo is very wide awake and capable of shrewd practices,  as shown by the following incident, which happened to my personal  knowledge.    A tall, gaudily appareled Indian, mounting a beautiful pony, came to  town and offered for sale at our store several gold nuggets the size of  hazelnuts. He took care to do this publicly, so as to attract the  attention of some Mexicans, who became immensely excited at the sight  of the gold and began to question him at once in order to ascertain how  and whence he had obtained the golden nuggets. They almost fought for  the privilege of taking him as an honored guest to their respective  homes. The Indian was very non-committal as regarded his gold mine, but  very willing to accept the sumptuous hospitality so freely rendered  him. He was soon passed on from one disappointed Mexican to another,  who in turn fared no better and invariably sped the parting guest to  the door of his nearest neighbor. When the Indian had made the circuit  of the town in this manner he looked very sleek and happy, indeed, but  the people were no wiser. The knowledge of having been shamefully  buncoed by an Indian and disappointed in their lust for gold made the  Mexicans desperate. They held an indignation meeting and resolved to  capture the wily Navajo and compel him, under torture, if necessary, to  divulge the secret of his gold mine. Consequently, they overcame the  Indian, and when they threatened him with torture and death, he yielded  and said that he had found the gold in the Rio de San Francisco, a  mountain stream of Arizona. He promised to guide them to the spot where  he obtained the nuggets, saying that the bottom of the stream was  literally covered with golden sand, which might be seen from a  distance, as it shone resplendently in the sun. Then every able-bodied  Mexican in town who possessed a horse prepared to join a prospecting  expedition to the wild regions of mysterious Arizona. They organized a  company and"]]]
