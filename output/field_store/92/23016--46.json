Mount Assiniboine, Canada (Fig. 20), resembles  the Matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies.    \"The Needles\" of Arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a  warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes.    Chemical decay, especially when carried on beneath a cover of  waste and vegetation, favors the production of rounded knobs and  dome-shaped mountains.    THE WEATHER CURVE. We have seen that weathering reduces the  angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by  chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges. In much the  same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth  blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way. High mountains  may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks (Fig.  181), but toward the end of their life history they wear down to  rounded hills (Fig. 182). The weather curve, which may be seen on  the summits of low hills (Fig. 21), is convex upward.    In Figure 22, representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are  a yard square, how many square feet of surface are exposed to the  weather by a cubic foot at a corner a; by one situated in the  middle of an edge b; by one in the center of a side c? How much  faster will a and b weather than c, and what will be the effect on  the shape of the block?    THE COOPERATION OF VARIOUS AGENCIES IN ROCK SCULPTURE. For the  sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each  geological agent separately. We must not forget, however, that in  Nature no agent works independently and alone; that every result  is the outcome of a long chain of causes. Thus, in order that the  mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration, the  waste must be rapidly removed,--a work done by many agents,  including some which we are yet to study; and in order that the  waste may be removed as fast as formed, the region must first have  been raised well above the level of the sea, so that the agents of  transportation could do their work effectively. The sculpture of  the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces.    The constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash  and carriage by streams is of the highest importance, because it  allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on  as long as any land remains above sea level. If waste were not  removed, it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock  beneath from further weathering, and the processes of destruction  which we have studied would be brought to an end. The very  presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the  whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed. The  destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be  carried away.    We have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of  the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks  of the land surface. Similar records we shall find buried deeply  among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and  decayed, telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather.  Ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now  quietly and unceasingly at work upon it, and have ever been the  chief means of the destruction of its rocks. The vast bulk of the  stratified rocks of the earth's crust is made up almost wholly of  the waste thus worn from ancient lands.    In studying the various geological agencies we must remember the  almost inconceivable times in which they work. The slowest process  when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on  produces great results. The geologist looks upon the land forms of  the earth's surface as monuments which record the slow action of  weathering and other agents during the ages of the past. The  mountain peak, the rounded hill, the wide plain which lies where  hills and mountains once stood, tell clearly of the great results  which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to  do their work. We should accustom ourselves also to think of the  results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass. The  tombstone and the bowlder of the field, which each year lose from  their surfaces a few crystalline grains, must in time be wholly  destroyed. The hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a  cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and  millenniums come and go, and will finally disappear. Even the  mountains are crumbling away continually, and therefore are but  fleeting features of the landscape.            CHAPTER II    THE WORK OF GROUND WATER      LAND WATERS. We have seen how large is the part that water plays  at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering  and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream  ways. We now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the  ground,--a corrosive agent still, and carrying in solution as its  load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble  parts.    Land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall. By the  heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the  ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere. Mingled as vapor with  the air, it is carried by the winds over sea and land, and  condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow. That part of  the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us, but  that which falls on the land accomplishes, as it returns to the  sea, the most important work of all surface geological agencies.    The rainfall may be divided into three parts: the first DRIES UP,  being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from  the soil or through vegetation; the second RUNS OFF over the  surface to flood the streams; the third SOAKS IN the ground and is  henceforth known as GROUND or UNDERGROUND WATER.    THE DESCENT OF GROUND WATER. Seeping through the mantle of waste,  ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying  rock. All rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less  porous, and all drink in water. IMPERVIOUS ROCKS, such as granite,  clay, and shale, have pores so minute that the water which they  take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction, and none  drains through. PERVIOUS ROCKS, on the other hand, such as many  sandstones, have pore spaces so large that water filters through  them more or less freely. Besides its seepage through the pores of  pervious rocks, water passes to lower levels through the joints  and cracks by which all rocks, near the surface are broken.    Even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of 1 in 400,  while sandstone may have a pore space of 1 in 4. Sand is so porous  that it may absorb a third of its volume of water, and a loose  loam even as much as one half.    THE GROUND-WATER SURFACE is the name given the upper surface of  ground water, the level below which all rocks are saturated. In  dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks. For ground water is  constantly seeping downward under gravity, it is evaporated in the  waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the  roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air. In wet  seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh  supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the  ground, and the ground-water surface rises.    In moist climates the ground-water surface (Fig. 24) lies, as a  rule, within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in  a general way, although with slopes of less inclination than those  of the hills and valleys. In dry climates permanent ground water  may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet. Ground water is  held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly  impeded by capillarity and friction. If it were as free to drain  away as are surface streams, it would sink soon after a rain to  the level of the deepest valleys of the region.    WELLS AND SPRINGS. Excavations made in permeable rocks below the  ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells.  Where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed, the  water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at  definite points called springs, where it is concentrated by the  structure of the rocks. A level tract where the ground-water  surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or  marsh.    By studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of  ground water. Spring water differs from that of the stream into  which it flows in several respects. If we test the spring with a  thermometer during successive months, we shall find that its  temperature remains much the same the year round. In summer it is  markedly cooler than the stream; in winter it is warmer and  remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice. This  means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from  the surface that it is little affected by summer's heat and  winter's cold.    While the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it  by rains, the spring remains clear; its water has been filtered  during its slow movement through many small underground passages  and the pores of rocks. Commonly the spring differs from the  stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock.  Chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in  solution, but these are usually in quantities so small that they  are not perceptible to the taste or feel. But the water of springs  is often well charged with soluble minerals; in its slow, long  journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the  rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as  it could. When spring water is boiled away, the invisible load  which it has carried is left behind, and in composition is found  to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients  of the country "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#7)"],[1,"me. He heard me all through in silence; and then, in a broken voice,  begged me to let him go to bed.    \"I'll tell ye the morn,\" he said; \"as sure as death I will.\"    And so weak was he that I could do nothing but consent. I locked him  into his room, however, and pocketed the key, and then returning to  the kitchen, made up such a blaze as had not shone there for many a long  year, and wrapping myself in my plaid, lay down upon the chests and fell  asleep.          CHAPTER V    I GO TO THE QUEEN'S FERRY    Much rain fell in the night; and the next morning there blew a bitter  wintry wind out of the north-west, driving scattered clouds. For all  that, and before the sun began to peep or the last of the stars had  vanished, I made my way to the side of the burn, and had a plunge in a  deep whirling pool. All aglow from my bath, I sat down once more  beside the fire, which I replenished, and began gravely to consider my  position.    There was now no doubt about my uncle's enmity; there was no doubt I  carried my life in my hand, and he would leave no stone unturned that  he might compass my destruction. But I was young and spirited, and  like most lads that have been country-bred, I had a great opinion of my  shrewdness. I had come to his door no better than a beggar and little  more than a child; he had met me with treachery and violence; it would  be a fine consummation to take the upper hand, and drive him like a herd  of sheep.    I sat there nursing my knee and smiling at the fire; and I saw myself in  fancy smell out his secrets one after another, and grow to be that man's  king and ruler. The warlock of Essendean, they say, had made a mirror in  which men could read the future; it must have been of other stuff than  burning coal; for in all the shapes and pictures that I sat and gazed  at, there was never a ship, never a seaman with a hairy cap, never a big  bludgeon for my silly head, or the least sign of all those tribulations  that were ripe to fall on me.    Presently, all swollen with conceit, I went up-stairs and gave my  prisoner his liberty. He gave me good-morning civilly; and I gave the  same to him, smiling down upon him, from the heights of my sufficiency.  Soon we were set to breakfast, as it might have been the day before.    \"Well, sir,\" said I, with a jeering tone, \"have you nothing more to say  to me?\" And then, as he made no articulate reply, \"It will be time,  I think, to understand each other,\" I continued. \"You took me for  a country Johnnie Raw, with no more mother-wit or courage than a  porridge-stick. I took you for a good man, or no worse than others at  the least. It seems we were both wrong. What cause you have to fear me,  to cheat me, and to attempt my life--\"    He murmured something about a jest, and that he liked a bit of fun; and  then, seeing me smile, changed his tone, and assured me he would make  all clear as soon as we had breakfasted. I saw by his face that he had  no lie ready for me, though he was hard at work preparing one; and I  think I was about to tell him so, when we were interrupted by a knocking  at the door.    Bidding my uncle sit where he was, I went to open it, and found on the  doorstep a half-grown boy in sea-clothes. He had no sooner seen me than  he began to dance some steps of the sea-hornpipe (which I had never  before heard of far less seen), snapping his fingers in the air and  footing it right cleverly. For all that, he was blue with the cold; and  there was something in his face, a look between tears and laughter, that  was highly pathetic and consisted ill with this gaiety of manner.    \"What cheer, mate?\" says he, with a cracked voice.    I asked him soberly to name his pleasure.    \"O, pleasure!\" says he; and then began to sing:         \"For it's my delight, of a shiny night,       In the season of the year.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"if you have no business at all, I will even be so  unmannerly as to shut you out.\"    \"Stay, brother!\" he cried. \"Have you no fun about you? or do you want  to get me thrashed? I've brought a letter from old Heasyoasy to Mr.  Belflower.\" He showed me a letter as he spoke. \"And I say, mate,\" he  added, \"I'm mortal hungry.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"come into the house, and you shall have a bite if I go  empty for it.\"    With that I brought him in and set him down to my own place, where he  fell-to greedily on the remains of breakfast, winking to me between  whiles, and making many faces, which I think the poor soul considered  manly. Meanwhile, my uncle had read the letter and sat thinking; then,  suddenly, he got to his feet with a great air of liveliness, and pulled  me apart into the farthest corner of the room.    \"Read that,\" said he, and put the letter in my hand.    Here it is, lying before me as I write:    \"The Hawes Inn, at the Queen's Ferry.    \"Sir,--I lie here with my hawser up and down, and send my cabin-boy to  informe. If you have any further commands for over-seas, to-day will be  the last occasion, as the wind will serve us well out of the firth.  I will not seek to deny that I have had crosses with your doer,* Mr.  Rankeillor; of which, if not speedily redd up, you may looke to see some  losses follow. I have drawn a bill upon you, as per margin, and am, sir,       your most obedt., humble servant, \"ELIAS HOSEASON.\"* Agent.    \"You see, Davie,\" resumed my uncle, as soon as he saw that I had done,  \"I have a venture with this man Hoseason, the captain of a trading brig,  the Covenant, of Dysart. Now, if you and me was to walk over with  yon lad, I could see the captain at the Hawes, or maybe on board the  Covenant if there was papers to be signed; and so far from a loss of  time, we can jog on to the lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor's. After a' that's  come and gone, ye would be swier* to believe me upon my naked word; but  ye'll believe Rankeillor. He's factor to half the gentry in these parts;  an auld man, forby: highly respeckit, and he kenned your father.\"         * Unwilling.    I stood awhile and thought. I was going to some place of shipping, which  was doubtless populous, and where my uncle durst attempt no violence,  and, indeed, even the society of the cabin-boy so far protected me. Once  there, I believed I could force on the visit to the lawyer, even if my  uncle were now insincere in proposing it; and, perhaps, in the bottom  of my heart, I wished a nearer view of the sea and ships. You are to  remember I had lived all my life in the inland hills, and just two days  before had my first sight of the firth lying like a blue floor, and the  sailed ships moving on the face of it, no bigger than toys. One thing  with another, I made up my mind.    \"Very well,\" says I, \"let us go to the Ferry.\"    My uncle got into his hat and coat, and buckled an old rusty cutlass on;  and then we trod the fire out, locked the door, and set forth upon our  walk.    The wind, being in that cold quarter the north-west, blew nearly in our  faces as we went. It was the month of June; the grass was all white with  daisies, and the trees with blossom; but, to judge by our blue nails  and aching wrists, the time might have been winter and the whiteness a  December frost.    Uncle Ebenezer trudged in the ditch, jogging from side to side like an  old ploughman coming home from work. He never said a word the whole  way; and I was thrown for talk on the cabin-boy. He told me his name was  Ransome, and that he had followed the sea since he was nine, but could  not say how old he was, as he had lost his reckoning. He showed me  tattoo marks, baring his breast in the teeth of the wind and in spite  of my remonstrances, for I thought it was enough to kill him; he swore  horribly whenever he remembered, but more like a silly schoolboy than a  man; and boasted of many wild and bad things that he had done: stealthy  thefts, false accusations, ay, and even murder; but all with such a  dearth of likelihood in the details, and such a weak and crazy swagger  in the delivery, as disposed me rather to pity than to believe him.    I asked him of the brig (which he declared was the finest ship that  sailed) and of Captain Hoseason, in whose praises he was equally loud.  Heasyoasy (for so he still named the skipper) was a man, by his account,  that minded for nothing either in heaven or earth; one that, as people  said, would \"crack on all sail into the day of judgment;\" rough, fierce,  unscrupulous, and brutal; and all this my poor cabin-boy had taught  himself to admire as something seamanlike and manly. He would only admit  one flaw in his idol. \"He ain't no seaman,\" he admitted. \"That's Mr.  Shuan that navigates the brig; he's the finest seaman in the trade, only  for drink; and I tell you I believe it! Why, look'ere;\" and turning down  his stocking he showed me a great, raw, red wound that made my blood run  cold. \"He done that--Mr. Shuan done it,\" he said, with an air of pride.    \"What!\" I cried, \"do you take such savage usage at his hands? Why, you  are no slave, to be so handled!\"    \"No,\" said the poor moon-calf, changing his tune at once, \"and so he'll  find. See'ere;\" and he showed me a great case-knife, which he told me  was stolen. \"O,\" says he, \"let me see him try; I dare him to; I'll do  for him! O, he ain't the first!\" And he confirmed it with a poor, silly,  ugly oath.    I have never felt such pity for any one in this wide world as I felt for  that half-witted creature, and it began to come over me that the brig  Covenant (for all her pious name) was little better than a hell upon the  seas.    \"Have you no friends?\" said I.    He said he had a father in some English seaport, I forget which.    \"He was a fine man, too,\" he said, \"but he's dead.\"    \"In Heaven's name,\" cried I, \"can you find no reputable life on shore?\"    \"O, no,\" says he, winking and looking very sly, \"they would put me to a  trade. I know a trick worth two of that, I do!\"    I asked him what trade could be so dreadful as the one he followed,  where he ran"]]]
