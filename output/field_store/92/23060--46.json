(All this has been repeated in four cases.)  The doctors let him  out of the madhouse, and then every kind of secret shift is  employed to prevent him from going free--whereby others would be  encouraged to refuse to serve as he has done--and at the same time  to avoid leaving him among the soldiers, for fear they too should  learn from him that military service is not at all their duty by  the law of God, as they are assured, but quite contrary to it.    The most convenient thing for the government would be to kill the  non-resistant by flogging him to death or some other means, as was  done in former days.  But to put a man openly to death because he  believes in the creed we all confess is impossible.  To let a man  alone who has refused obedience is also impossible.  And so the  government tries either to compel the man by ill-treatment to  renounce Christ, or in some way or other to get rid of him  unobserved, without openly putting him to death, and to hide  somehow both the action and the man himself from other people.  And so all kinds of shifts and wiles and cruelties are set on foot  against him.  They either send him to the frontier or provoke him  to insubordination, and then try him for breach of discipline and  shut him up in the prison of the disciplinary battalion, where  they can ill treat him freely unseen by anyone, or they declare  him mad, and lock him up in a lunatic asylum.  They sent one man  in this way to Tashkend--that is, they pretended to transfer to  the Tashkend army; another to Omsk; a third him they convicted of  insubordination and shut up in prison; a fourth they sent to a  lunatic asylum.    Everywhere the same story is repeated.  Not only the government,  but the great majority of liberal, advanced people, as they are  called, studiously turn away from everything that has been said,  written, or done, or is being done by men to prove the  incompatibility of force in its most awful, gross, and glaring  form--in the form, that is, of an army of soldiers prepared to  murder anyone, whoever it may be--with the teachings of  Christianity, or even of the humanity which society professes as  its creed.    So that the information I have gained of the attitude of the  higher ruling classes, not only in Russia but in Europe and  America, toward the elucidation of this question has convinced me  that there exists in these ruling classes a consciously hostile  attitude to true Christianity, which is shown pre-eminently in  their reticence in regard to all manifestations of it.          CHAPTER II.    CRITICISMS OF THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE ON  THE PART OF BELIEVERS AND OF UNBELIEVERS.    Fate of the Book \"What I Believe\"--Evasive Character of Religious  Criticisms of Principles of my Book--1st Reply: Use of Force  not Opposed to Christianity--2d Reply: Use of Force Necessary  to Restrain Evil Doers--3d Reply: Duty of Using Force in  Defense of One's Neighbor--4th Reply: The Breach of the Command  of Non-resistance to be Regarded Simply as a Weakness--5th  Reply: Reply Evaded by Making Believe that the Question has  long been Decided--To Devise such Subterfuges and to take  Refuge Behind the Authority of the Church, of Antiquity, and of  Religion is all that Ecclesiastical Critics can do to get out  of the Contradiction between Use of Force and Christianity in  Theory and in Practice--General Attitude of the Ecclesiastical  World and of the Authorities to Profession of True  Christianity--General Character of Russian Freethinking  Critics--Foreign Freethinking Critics--Mistaken Arguments of  these Critics the Result of Misunderstanding the True Meaning  of Christ's Teaching.      The impression I gained of a desire to conceal, to hush up, what I  had tried to express in my book, led me to judge the book itself  afresh.    On its appearance it had, as I had anticipated, been forbidden,  and ought therefore by law to have been burnt.  But, at the same  time, it was discussed among officials, and circulated in a great  number of manuscript and lithograph copies, and in translations  printed abroad.    And very quickly after the book, criticisms, both religious and  secular in character, made their appearance, and these the  government tolerated, and even encouraged.  So that the refutation  of a book which no one was supposed to know anything about was  even chosen as the subject for theological dissertations in the  academies.    The criticisms of my book, Russian and foreign alike, fall under  two general divisions--the religious criticisms of men who regard  themselves as believers, and secular criticisms, that is, those of  freethinkers.    I will begin with the first class.  In my book I made it an  accusation against the teachers of the Church that their teaching  is opposed to Christ's commands clearly and definitely expressed  in the Sermon on the Mount, and opposed in especial to his command  in regard to resistance to evil, and that in this way they deprive  Christ's teaching of all value.  The Church authorities accept the  teaching of the Sermon on the Mount on non-resistance to evil by  force as divine revelation; and therefore one would have thought  that if they felt called upon to write about my book at all, they  would have found it inevitable before everything else to reply to  the principal point of my charge against them, and to say plainly,  do they or do they not admit the teaching of the Sermon on the  Mount and the commandment of non-resistance to evil as binding on  a Christian.  And they were bound to answer this question, not  after the usual fashion (i. e., \"that although on the one side one  cannot absolutely deny, yet on the other side one cannot main  fully assent, all the more seeing that,\" etc., etc.).  No; they  should have answered the question as plainly as it was put  in my book--Did Christ really demand from his disciples  that they should carry out what he taught them in the Sermon on  the Mount?  And can a Christian, then, or can he not, always  remaining a Christian, go to law or make any use of the law, or  seek his own protection in the law?  And can the Christian, or can  he not, remaining a Christian, take part in the administration of  government, using compulsion against his neighbors?  And--the most  important question hanging over the heads of all of us in these  days of universal military service--can the Christian, or can he  not, remaining a Christian, against Christ's direct prohibition,  promise obedience in future actions directly opposed to his  teaching?  And can he, by taking his share of service in the army,  prepare himself to murder men, and even actually murder them?    These questions were put plainly and directly, and seemed to  require a plain and direct answer; but in all the criticisms of my  book there was no such plain and direct answer.  No; my book  received precisely the same treatment as all the attacks upon the  teachers of the Church for their defection from the Law of Christ  of which history from the days of Constantine is full.    A very great deal was said in connection with my book of my having  incorrectly interpreted this and other passages of the Gospel, of  my being in error in not recognizing the Trinity, the redemption,  and the immortality of the soul.  A very great deal was said, but  not a word about the one thing which for every Christian is the  most essential question in life--how to reconcile the duty of  forgiveness, meekness, patience, and love for all, neighbors and  enemies alike, which is so clearly expressed in the words of our  teacher, and in the heart of each of us--how to reconcile this  duty with the obligation of using force in war upon men of our own  or a foreign people.    All that are worth calling answers to this question can be brought  under the following five heads.  I have tried to bring together in  this connection all I could, not only from the criticisms on my  book, but from what has been written in past times on this theme.    The first and crudest form of reply consists in the bold assertion  that the use of force is not opposed by the teaching of Christ;  that it is permitted, and even enjoined, on the Christian by the  Old and New Testaments.    Assertions of this kind proceed, for the most part, from men who  have attained the highest ranks in the governing or ecclesiastical  hierarchy, and who are consequently perfectly assured that no one  will dare to contradict their assertion, and that if anyone does  contradict it they will hear nothing of the contradiction.  These  men have, for the most part, through the intoxication of power, so  lost the right idea of what that Christianity is in the name of  which they hold their position that what is Christian in  Christianity presents itself to them as heresy, while everything  in the Old and New Testaments which can be distorted into an  antichristian and heathen meaning they regard as the foundation of  Christianity.  In support of their assertion that Christianity is  not opposed to the use of force, these men usually, with the  greatest audacity, bring together all the most obscure passages  from the Old and New Testaments, interpreting them in the most  unchristian way--the punishment of Ananias and Sapphira, of Simon  the Sorcerer, etc.  They quote all those sayings of Christ's which  can possibly be interpreted as justification of cruelty: the  expulsion from the Temple; \"It shall be more tolerable for the  land of Sodom than for this city,\" etc., etc.  According to these  people's notions, a Christian government is not in the least bound  to be guided by the spirit of peace, forgiveness of injuries, and  love for enemies.    To refute such an assertion is useless, because the very  people who make this assertion refute themselves, or, rather,  renounce Christ, inventing a Christianity and a Christ of their  own in the place of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#7)"],[1,"Vittorio Emanuele, where there was a band or music of  sorts. At other times the poet had his way, and we visited a humble  cafe opposite the Palazzo Comunale, and afterwards plunged into the  dark and mysterious alleys of the mediaeval city. These were the  evenings that I loved the most. In the distance we could hear the  faint beat of music, and up and down the Corso flowed the gay tide  of promenaders, which always turned before it reached us. Above us  loomed the great Palazzo, which is justly Perugia's pride. In the  gloom its brown and bulging walls would have been as forbidding as  a fortress's but for the delicate tracery of its windows and its  fantastic Gothic door, with the Griffin of the City gazing down  hungrily into the night. The lovely fountain on which the Pisani  and Arnolfo di Cambio lavished their genius was nothing but a  beautiful silhouette against the loggia which Braccio Fortebraccio  put up to shield his beloved citizens from the sun; and on the  steps of the gaunt cathedral the statue of Papa Giulio III., with  raised hand, blessed his careless people.    For Perugia is careless, beautifully and graciously careless. She  has forgotten her woes, she has almost forgotten her old enemies;  she has certainly forgotten to finish her cathedral. And yet  when we sat at night in this romantic spot, where the art of  four hundred years is garnered, we noticed a little yellow lamp  flickering unsteadily above the cathedral door, no brighter than  a glow-worm in comparison with the flare of electric light close  at hand. The passers-by told us its history: how the people of  Perugia, feeling the iron hand of the Farnese Pope, turned for help  to Ridolfo, the last of the great Baglioni Princes. How Ridolfo  failed them, and how in their extremity they turned to Christ,  and besought Him with cries and sobs, tearing their garments and  beating themselves like the Flagellants of the thirteenth century,  to defend them against the terrible Paul III. They placed the  crucifix above the door of San Lorenzo, where the light shines  every night, and laid the keys of the city below the tortured  feet of the Saviour. We know that their prayers were of no avail,  yet every night in Perugia, that city of beautiful and romantic  memories, they still light the little lantern over the cathedral  door, where the crucifix was placed, when they crept with fear  and trembling to the feet of Christ to ask for help against his  Vicar, because Ridolfo Baglione, forsooth! had failed them in their  necessity.    [Illustration: PERUGIA: PORTA EBURNEA.]    A step from here and we found ourselves in the dark and  memory-laden streets of the old town, with their vaulted passages  and their blocked-up Doors of the Dead--those pitiful defences  against the Common Enemy, in which Japan as well as Italy put  faith.[5] Of them all I loved the Via Vecchia best, with its air of  mystery and its many arches linking the grim old palaces together.  At night it was so gloomy there that we could barely find our way  past the ancient Canonica in which so many of the Popes snatched  a holiday from Rome; and as we went down the hill, always between  great palaces, the darkness closed round us. Here and there a  feeble light illuminated the steep path, but for the rest there was  only the starlight to guide us until we came to the great Porta  Augusta, which spanned the road majestically, full of the dignity  of dead Etruria. Seen thus against the stars, with its graceful  fifteenth-century loggia faintly illumined by a yellow light  within, it was as impressive as the pylon of an Egyptian Temple.      Or, if our steps took us another way, we passed the grim towers  of mediaeval mansions, and presently found ourselves at the  Baglioni's Gate of Dreams, or the Porta Mandola, as the Etruscan  gate is called. Here, of a certainty, we would hear music, for  whenever I have passed through that ancient gate at night, the  silence has been broken by gay songs. Sometimes I have sat there  far into the night, dreaming of the Baglioni and listening to the  careless music of I knew not what laughter-loving house. For no  one can live long in Perugia without being fired by the memory of  those strange men whose strength and beauty was famous throughout  Italy, and whose lovely names alone fit them to be the heroes of  romance--Grifonetto, Astorre, Gismondo, Sermonetto, Morgante. If  we believe their adoring chronicler, who though he traced their  downfall could not speak of them without the stately prefix 'High  and Mighty Lords,' their beauty was the beauty of the ancient Gods  of Greece, and their courage was the courage of the Heroes. And who  of us but has wept over the Great Betrayal, and the passing of the  beautiful Grifonetto, forgiven at the last by Atalanta? And who has  not loved the young Astorre in his Cloth of Gold bringing his fair  young bride back to his home; and thrilled to read of the Homeric  death of Sermonetto, 'so strong and gallant while he lived that  tongue of man cannot tell the worth of him. One, in very truth, who  never in all his days knew what fear was, and till the last word  died on his lips ever showed himself the greater-hearted, as though  he were not vanquished, but victor of his foe.'           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: PERUGIA: THE TOMB OF THE VOLUMNII.]    Early one hot and cloudless August morning, while the farmers  with many cries of 'per la Madonna!' were urging their oxen up  the hill to market in the shadow of the old grey University of  Perugia, we drove down into the Valley of the Tiber to see the  wonderful Etruscan tomb close to Ponte San Giovanni, which was  the burial-place of the Volumnii. It is of special interest not  only for its excellent preservation, but because it belongs to the  Roman-Etruscan period, and forms the connecting link between the  old Etruscan tombs and the famous Roman sepulchres a mile or two  outside Rome on the Latin Way.    A short descent took us into the subterranean vault at whose  portal, cut out of the tufa rock, lay the ancient stone door,  set aside now for a modern gate of iron. As we passed into the  dark antechamber the chill damp air was cold as death after  the cicala-haunted sunshine of the fields above. But while we  strained our eyes to pierce the gloom the custode turned on an  electric light hidden behind the cornice, and straightway we  forgot everything in the wonder of the scene before us. In an  inner chamber, resting upon their carved sarcophagi, we saw the  inmates of the tomb grouped round the urn on which reposed the head  of the house above two finely sculptured furies. On the coffered  ceiling a gorgon's head, very terrible, with knotted snakes on its  temples and horror in its face, stared down upon the dead. And  as our eyes became accustomed to the dim light we discovered the  strange symbolism of Etruria all round us. From the ceiling of  the ante-chamber, on whose benches the relatives of the deceased  reclined, to feast or watch beside their dead, little genii,  exquisitely beautiful and light as butterflies, were hanging by the  leaden chains by which they were suspended more than two thousand  years ago. Over the doorway was a sun-disk, springing from the  waves--fit emblem of the immortality of these Etruscans, springing  from the waves of oblivion which for so many centuries washed over  them. But there was none of the colour which makes beautiful the  Tombs of Egypt, and there was hardly the same air of eternity. In  the long corridors of the Royal Tombs of the Pharaohs there is an  archaic defiance as of a life long since forgotten and lost in  the dust of centuries. Here the life is of yesterday; we could  almost hear the heart of Greece and Rome beating gaily in a young  world, and the languid tread of the effete Etruscans, whose curious  symbolism at once repels and mystifies, with its red lascivious  serpents, its demons and furies, its beautiful and reluctant  Medusas, and its solemn mockery of the feasting dead.          TODI      When I think of Todi the first things that I remember are the  golden tassels of the corn against the sky, and the blue chicory  which starred the dusty roadside as we drove to her from Perugia  across the young Tiber. For little Todi, enthroned on her steep  hill, has no railway within thirty-three miles of her gates; and if  you do not wish to ravish the leagues which separate her from the  world by motor, you can only reach her after many hours spent in  the exquisite and touching beauty of the Umbrian Vale. She is one  of those forgotten cities which are still to be found on the hills  of Italy. The years have trampled lightly within her ancient walls;  she has no trains, no jangling trams, very few motors except the  grey automobile from Perugia which bursts noisily into the heart  of her every day. She is a charmed city, whose name is painted on  a signboard outside the gates lest the traveller should pass her  by unwittingly. Within her walls we shook the dust of a work-a-day  world from our feet, and forgot its turmoil in the music of her  bells, which tell the passing hours with the loving persistence of  those grown old in labour.    To many people Todi is a mere horizon of towers on the crest of a  distant hill. To me she is the dwelling-place of happiness. And  because I am a little jealous for Todi, and would have you love  her as I loved her, having watched her grow in beauty as the miles  decreased between us, I beg your patience while we thread the plain  between Perugia and Tuder of the Umbrians.    It was a day of sun and shadow, an ideal morning for an expedition  into Arcady, and we found the beauty of a young world down in the  Valley of the Tiber. The jangle of harness-bells called us early  from our breakfast, and the air was like wine cooled with snow as  we drove down Perugia's four-mile hill, past her great churches,  and on to the long"]]]
