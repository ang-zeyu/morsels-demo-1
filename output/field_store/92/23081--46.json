I  became hungry and wandered through this vast orchard searching for  fruit to eat, but I found none. While I stood in amazement finding no  fruit in the midst of so many trees, they began to fall to the ground  as if torn up by a whirlwind. They continued to fall until there was  not a tree standing in the whole orchard. I immediately saw thereafter  shoots springing up from the roots and forming themselves into young  and beautiful trees. These budded, blossomed, and brought forth fruit  which ripened and was the most beautiful to look upon of anything my  eyes had ever beheld. I stretched forth {17} my hand and plucked some  of the fruit. I gazed upon it with delight; but when I was about to eat  of it, the vision closed and I did not taste the fruit.'    \"'At the close of the vision I bowed down in humble prayer and asked  the Lord to show me the meaning of the vision. Then the voice of the  Lord came to me saying: \"Son of man, thou hast sought me diligently to  know the truth concerning my Church and Kingdom among men. This is to  show you that my Church is not organized among men in the generation  to which you belong; but in the days of your children the Church and  Kingdom of God shall be made manifest with all the gifts and the  blessings enjoyed by the Saints in past ages. You shall live to be made  acquainted with it, but shall not partake of its blessings before you  depart this life. You will be blest of the Lord after death because you  have followed the dictation of my Spirit in this life.\"'    \"When Father Mason had finished relating the vision and its  interpretation, he said, calling me by my Christian name: 'Wilford, I  shall never partake of this fruit in the flesh, but you will and you  will become a conspicuous actor in the new kingdom.' He then turned  and left me. These were the last words he ever spoke to me upon the  earth. To me this was a very striking circumstance. I had passed many  days during a period of twenty years with this old Father Mason. He had  never mentioned this vision to me before. On this occasion he said he  felt impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to relate it to me.    \"The vision was given to him about the year 1800. He related it to me  in 1830, the spring in which the Church was organized. Three years  later when I was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, almost the first person I thought of was this prophet, Robert  Mason. Upon my arrival in Missouri with Zion's Camp, I wrote him a  long letter in which I informed him that I had found the true gospel  with all its blessings; that the authority of the Church of Christ had  been restored to the earth as he had told me it would be; that I had  received the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands; that  I knew for myself that God had established through Joseph Smith, the  Prophet, the Church of Christ upon the earth.    \"He received my letter with great joy and had it read over {18} to him  many times. He handled it as he had handled the fruit in the vision. He  was very aged and soon died without having the privilege of receiving  the ordinances of the gospel at the hands of an elder of the Church.    \"The first opportunity I had after the truth of baptism for the dead  was revealed, I went forth and was baptized for him in the temple font  at Nauvoo. He was a good man, a true prophet; for his prophecies have  been fulfilled. There was so much reason in the teachings of this man,  and such harmony between them and the prophecies and teachings of  Christ and of the apostles and prophets of old, that I believed in them  with all my heart.    \"I had given myself up to the reading of the Scriptures and to earnest  prayer before God day and night as far as I could years before I heard  the fullness of the gospel preached by a Latter-day Saint. I had  pleaded with the Lord many hours in the forest, among the rocks, and  in the fields, and in the mill--often at midnight for light and truth  and for His Spirit to guide me in the way of salvation. My prayers  were answered and many things were revealed to me. My mind was open to  the truth so much so that I was fully satisfied that I should live to  see the true Church of Christ established upon the earth and to see a  people raised up who would keep the commandments of the Lord.\"    This beautiful and inspiring story of Robert Mason reads very much  like that of Simeon of old, who, having received a divine response to  his steadfast supplications, exclaimed: \"Lord, now lettest thy servant  depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy  salvation.\"    In reading the history of the Church, one is constantly impressed by  the striking comparisons between the events recorded in Holy Writ and  those which have been forerunners as well as accompaniments of the  Church of Christ in this dispensation. The Spirit of God makes these  analogies impressive, and they in turn confirm the faith of those who  have received a testimony of the divine mission of Joseph Smith and of  the purposes of God to be fulfilled by the Church in these last days.  No wonder Wilford Woodruff's mind was open to the truth. No wonder  that doubt or misgiving never beclouded his mind {19} from the day  that the new light broke in upon his understanding to the day of his  death. His life is one of the most beautiful examples of a childlike  faith that has ever been given to the world. The story of it is both  faith-promoting and instructive. It reads like the stories of Holy Writ.    {20}        CHAPTER 4.    EARLY DAYS, 1816-1833.

Much of the early life of Wilford Woodruff was passed in Farmington,  Connecticut. He was a boy of great vitality and given to the sports  incident to the community and the times in which he lived. He early  developed a marked aptitude for fishing. In the stream which fed his  father's mill there were spotted trout in abundance. These he learned  to catch with great dexterity; and his brother, being likewise an  adept with the hook, the two achieved the reputation of being the most  successful fishermen in the village. The sports of fishing and hunting  which he practiced in early boyhood were enjoyed by him throughout his  entire life.    One is reminded in the story of his life that there were apostles of  old who cast their nets for fish in the sea of Galilee. Like them, he  too became a fisher of men. He was equally prompt in responding to the  Master's call and equally ardent in promulgating the new word of life  he was authorized to publish. We are not told how many converts were  the result of their missionary efforts, but it is quite within the  bounds of truth to declare that no apostle of the last dispensation  succeeded better than Wilford Woodruff in planting the message of the  new dispensation in the hearts of his fellow-men.    He attended the village district school in his early boyhood, a school  located about two miles from his father's home. \"In those days,\" he  writes, \"parents did not feel the importance of urging upon their  children the advantages of education as they urge them today. In those  times they felt that matters of education were wholly confined to the  ideas and methods of the school teacher.\" Wilford was an industrious  boy. His mind was filled with lofty thoughts, and his education as time  went on took on a religious character. He was by nature a devoted son  and {21} observed carefully the divine command which enjoined obedience  to his parents.    Aphek Woodruff, father of Wilford, was a generous-hearted man. He  rarely refused to grant a favor even when it seemed probable that  the favor might prove a loss to him. The father by his industry and  frugality had acquired a respectable competency for those days. His  property, however, soon dwindled away when those for whom he became  security left him to meet their obligations. His possessions consisted  of a large farm well stocked with cattle, a flour mill, a saw mill, and  a carding machine. These had cost years of toil and self-denial. Their  loss to him saved his honor, but subjected his family to the hardships  which the changed financial conditions brought about. These experiences  of his father had much to do in the formation of his son's character,  for the latter avoided debts and was scrupulously careful to make his  word good in every business undertaking.    When Wilford was eight years of age, a strong religious revival took  place in the town of Farmington. It was conducted chiefly by the  Baptist Church; the elders of that Church, Brocket and Quishman,  preached in his father's home. They baptized his stepmother and several  other relatives. His brothers, Azmon and Thompson, made some profession  of religion. Wilford attended meetings, prayed, and tried to feel as  others felt, but all to no purpose. Whatever of enthusiasm worked  upon his feelings in the excitement of the meetings soon passed away  and left his soul unfed by the bread of life. The next elder brother,  Thompson, was in a similar condition. His eldest brother, Azmon,  continued his interest and devotion until several years later when he  embraced the fulness of the gospel.    His father, having sold his property at Northington, moved back to  Farmington where he was employed to run the flour mill owned by Cowles,  Deming & Camp. This employment he continued for twenty-eight years.

Exalt the  standard of Democracy! Down with that of priestcraft, and let all the  people say Amen! That the blood of the fathers may not cry from the  ground against us. Sacred is the memory of that blood which bought for  us our liberty_.\"    This surely is sufficiently non-partisan, cosmopolitan and patriotic.  Is it not of the essence of Americanism? And under such sentiments  would not every member of the Church be able to perform his political  duty in either of the great American parties then existing or  afterwards to arise?    It is not necessary to pursue this subject further. It is enough to say  that the political fears of the old settlers of Missouri, though based  upon conjecture as to what could or might happen, were real fears, and  became one of the causes of the Missouri persecutions.    _The Saints and the Indians_.    The interest of the Saints in the American Indians grows out of the  knowledge they have of their forefathers, revealed through the Book  of Mormon. From the historical parts of that book they learned the  origin of these Indians; that they are of the house of Israel: from  the prophetic parts of the book they learn of their future, that it  is to be glorious; that fallen as their fortunes now are, they will  not always remain so; extinction is not their fate, but before many  generations shall pass away they will become a white and a delightsome  people, favored of God, and prominent in bringing to pass His purposes  in the land of Zion--the two Americas. It was a mission to the  Lamanites or Indians which first brought several of the Elders of the  Church of Christ to western Missouri. When the people of Missouri  learned in what esteem the Saints held the forefathers of the Indians,  and also the Indians themselves, both on account of their forefathers  and the promises of God to them, it was but reasonable that they should  conclude there was--as indeed there is--a strong sympathy on the part  of the Saints towards the Indians; and there was great reason to  believe that this sympathy might become mutual.    {XXX} It was in this substratum of truth that the false accusations  against the Saints were founded to the effect that they were seeking  to enter into an alliance with the Indian tribes of the west for the  purpose of driving the old settlers from their possessions in western  Missouri, in order that the Saints with the Indians might possess the  land to the exclusion of the \"Gentiles.\"    To appreciate the seriousness of this charge, it should be remembered  that the Indian tribes formerly residing east of the Mississippi,  about this time--during President Jackson's two presidential terms,  1829-1837--were being transplanted into the country immediately west of  Missouri, so that there were great numbers of these people--amounting  to many thousands--being massed just beyond the boundaries of the  state. Many of the tribes were in no amiable mood either. In some  instances the terms of the treaties by which they accepted lands in  the Indian territory west of Missouri, for lands that constituted  their old homes in the East and South, were forced upon them after--to  them--disastrous wars; so that it might well be suspected that they  would be ready to follow any leader who would hold out promise of  regaining their lost possessions, or who would give them the hope of  revenge upon their despoilers.    Let these facts be considered and given their due weight, and the  reader will not find it difficult to perceive what a potent factor  against the Saints this charge of holding communication with the  Indians for the purpose of dispossessing the people of western Missouri  of their homes would be; and, as in the case of the slavery question,  their enemies were not slow to see the advantage, and made the most  of it. It was not until the agitation for the removal of the Saints  from Clay county began, however, 1836, that this charge of holding  communication with the Indians for the purposes already set forth, was  publicly made. Then in the document adopted at the mass meeting setting  forth the several reasons of the old settlers for asking the Saints to  remove from Clay county, this passage occurs:    \"In addition to all this, they are charged, as they have hitherto been,  with keeping up a constant communication with our Indian tribes on  the frontiers; with declaring, even from the pulpit, that the Indians  are a part of God's chosen people, and are destined by heaven to  inherit this land, in common with themselves. We do not vouch for the  correctness of these statements; but whether they are true or false,  their effect has been the same in exciting the community. In times of  greater tranquility, such ridiculous remarks might well be regarded as  the offspring of frenzied fanaticism; but at this time, our defenseless  situation on the frontier, the bloody disasters of our fellow citizens  in Florida and other parts of the South, all tend to make a portion of  our {XXXI} citizens regard such sentiments with horror, if not alarm.  These and many other causes have combined to raise a prejudice against  them, and a feeling of hostility, that the first spark may, and we  deeply fear will, ignite into all the horrors and desolations of a  civil war, the worst evil that can befall any country.\"    Governor Dunklin, shortly after this, in answer to appeals made to him  by the Saints for protection, by the execution of the law, on this  charge of holding communication with the Indians, said: \"Your neighbors  accuse your people with holding illicit communication with the Indians,  and of being opposed to slavery. You deny. Whether the charge or the  denial is true, I cannot tell. The fact exists, and your neighbors seem  to believe it true; and whether true or false, the consequences will be  the same (if your opponents are not merely gasconnading), unless you  can, by your conduct and arguments, convince them of your innocence. If  you cannot do this, all I can say to you is that in this Republic the  _vox populi_ is the _vox Dei_.\"    Of course this false accusation was emphatically denied by the Saints.  In a public meeting held by the members of the Church to draw up a  reply to the request of the people of Clay county, that the Saints  remove from that county, they said: \"We deny holding any communication  with the Indians, and mean to hold ourselves as ready to defend our  country against their barbarous ravages as any other people. We believe  that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments  in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable  rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and rebellion  are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished  accordingly.\"    In a communication signed by the Prophet Joseph and several other  presiding officers of the Church, and addressed to the leading men of  Clay county, referring to the Indian charge, this was said: \"Another  charge of great magnitude is brought against our friends in the west,  that of keeping up a constant communication with the Indian tribes on  the frontier; with declaring, even from the pulpit, that the Indians  are a part of God's chosen people, and are destined by heaven to  inherit this land, in common with themselves. We know of nothing under  the present aspect of our Indian relations calculated to arouse the  fears of the people of the Upper Missouri more than a combination of  influences of this nature; and we cannot look upon it as being other  than one of the most subtle purposes of those whose feelings are  embittered against our friends, to turn the eye of suspicion upon them  from every man who is acquainted with the barbarous cruelty of rude  savages. Since a rumor was afloat that the western Indians were showing  signs of war, we have received frequent private {XXXII} letters from  our friends, who have not only expressed fears for their own safety, in  case the Indians should break out, but a decided determination to be  among the first to repel any invasion and defend the frontier from all  hostilities. We mention the last fact because it was wholly uncalled  for on our part, and came previous to any excitement on the part of the  people of Clay county against our friends, and must definitely show  that this charge is untrue.\"    But all these denials went for nothing. As remarked by Governor  Dunklin, whether the denial or the charge was true, people at a  distance, at least, might not tell; quite generally, however,  the charge was believed, and helped to swell the volume of  prejudice--already too great--against the Saints. Indeed, so potent  a factor was this charge of holding illicit communication with the  Indians, in arousing prejudice against the Saints, that it was used  against them with great effect after their settlement in Utah. It was  one of the charges made against them at the time the general government  of the United States was induced by their enemies to send out an army  to suppress a rebellion in Utah that had no existence except in the  hate-frenzied minds of the detractors of the Saints.    \"It is charged,\" said Stephen A. Douglas in a speech at Springfield,  Illinois, on the 12th of June, 1857 [10]--\"It is charged * * * * that  the Mormon government, with Brigham Young at its head, is now forming  alliances with Indian tribes in Utah and adjoining territories,  stimulating the Indians to acts of hostility, and organizing bands of  his own followers, under the name of Danites or destroying angels, to  prosecute a system of robbery and murders upon American citizens who  support the authority of the United States, and denounce the infamous  and disgusting practices and institutions of the Mormon government.\"    The army came only to find the foregoing with other charges that had  induced the general government to send it to Utah, untrue."]]]
