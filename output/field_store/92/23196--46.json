These little incidents are bound to  happen when one is in a nervous and highly-strung condition.    The fifth and sixth holes produced no unusual features. Peter won the  fifth in eleven, and James the sixth in ten. The short seventh they  halved in nine. The eighth, always a tricky hole, they took no  liberties with, James, sinking a long putt with his twenty-third, just  managing to halve. A ding-dong race up the hill for the ninth found  James first at the pin, and they finished the first nine with James one  up.    As they left the green James looked a little furtively at his  companion.    \"You might be strolling on to the tenth,\" he said. \"I want to get a few  balls at the shop. And my mashie wants fixing up. I sha'n't be long.\"    \"I'll come with you,\" said Peter.    \"Don't bother,\" said James. \"You go on and hold our place at the tee.\"    I regret to say that James was lying. His mashie was in excellent  repair, and he still had a dozen balls in his bag, it being his prudent  practice always to start out with eighteen. No! What he had said was  mere subterfuge. He wanted to go to his locker and snatch a few minutes  with Sandy MacBean's \"How to Become a Scratch Man\". He felt sure that  one more glance at the photograph of Mr. MacBean driving would give him  the mastery of the stroke and so enable him to win the match. In this I  think he was a little sanguine. The difficulty about Sandy MacBean's  method of tuition was that he laid great stress on the fact that the  ball should be directly in a line with a point exactly in the centre of  the back of the player's neck; and so far James's efforts to keep his  eye on the ball and on the back of his neck simultaneously had produced  no satisfactory results.           *       *       *       *       *    It seemed to James, when he joined Peter on the tenth tee, that the  latter's manner was strange. He was pale. There was a curious look in  his eye.    \"James, old man,\" he said.    \"Yes?\" said James.    \"While you were away I have been thinking. James, old man, do you  really love this girl?\"    James stared. A spasm of pain twisted Peter's face.    \"Suppose,\" he said in a low voice, \"she were not all you--we--think she  is!\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Nothing, nothing.\"    \"Miss Forrester is an angel.\"    \"Yes, yes. Quite so.\"    \"I know what it is,\" said James, passionately. \"You're trying to put me  off my stroke. You know that the least thing makes me lose my form.\"    \"No, no!\"    \"You hope that you can take my mind off the game and make me go to  pieces, and then you'll win the match.\"    \"On the contrary,\" said Peter. \"I intend to forfeit the match.\"    James reeled.    \"What!\"    \"I give up.\"    \"But--but----\" James shook with emotion. His voice quavered. \"Ah!\" he  cried. \"I see now: I understand! You are doing this for me because I am  your pal. Peter, this is noble! This is the sort of thing you read  about in books. I've seen it in the movies. But I can't accept the  sacrifice.\"    \"You must!\"    \"No, no!\"    \"I insist!\"    \"Do you mean this?\"    \"I give her up, James, old man. I--I hope you will be happy.\"    \"But I don't know what to say. How can I thank you?\"    \"Don't thank me.\"    \"But, Peter, do you fully realize what you are doing? True, I am one  up, but there are nine holes to go, and I am not right on my game  today. You might easily beat me. Have you forgotten that I once took  forty-seven at the dog-leg hole? This may be one of my bad days. Do you  understand that if you insist on giving up I shall go to Miss Forrester  tonight and propose to her?\"    \"I understand.\"    \"And yet you stick to it that you are through?\"    \"I do. And, by the way, there's no need for you to wait till tonight.  I saw Miss Forrester just now outside the tennis court. She's alone.\"    James turned crimson.    \"Then I think perhaps----\"    \"You'd better go to her at once.\"    \"I will.\" James extended his hand. \"Peter, old man, I shall never  forget this.\"    \"That's all right.\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Now, do you mean? Oh, I shall potter round the second nine. If you  want me, you'll find me somewhere about.\"    \"You'll come to the wedding, Peter?\" said James, wistfully.    \"Of course,\" said Peter. \"Good luck.\"    He spoke cheerily, but, when the other had turned to go, he stood  looking after him thoughtfully. Then he sighed a heavy sigh.           *       *       *       *       *    James approached Miss Forrester with a beating heart. She made a  charming picture as she stood there in the sunlight, one hand on her  hip, the other swaying a tennis racket.    \"How do you do?\" said James.    \"How are you, Mr. Todd? Have you been playing golf?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"With Mr. Willard?\"    \"Yes. We were having a match.\"    \"Golf,\" said Grace Forrester, \"seems to make men very rude. Mr. Willard  left me without a word in the middle of our conversation.\"    James was astonished.    \"Were you talking to Peter?\"    \"Yes. Just now. I can't understand what was the matter with him. He  just turned on his heel and swung off.\"    \"You oughtn't to turn on your heel when you swing,\" said James; \"only  on the ball of the foot.\"    \"I beg your pardon?\"    \"Nothing, nothing. I wasn't thinking. The fact is, I've something on my  mind. So has Peter. You mustn't think too hardly of him. We have been  playing an important match, and it must have got on his nerves. You  didn't happen by any chance to be watching us?\"    \"No.\"    \"Ah! I wish you had seen me at the lake-hole. I did it one under par.\"    \"Was your father playing?\"    \"You don't understand. I mean I did it in one better than even the  finest player is supposed to do it. It's a mashie-shot, you know. You  mustn't play too light, or you fall in the lake; and you mustn't play  it too hard, or you go past the hole into the woods. It requires the  nicest delicacy and judgment, such as I gave it. You might have to wait  a year before seeing anyone do it in two again. I doubt if the 'pro.'  often does it in two. Now, directly we came to this hole today, I made  up my mind that there was going to be no mistake. The great secret of  any shot at golf is ease, elegance, and the ability to relax. The  majority of men, you will find, think it important that their address  should be good.\"    \"How snobbish! What does it matter where a man lives?\"    \"You don't absolutely follow me. I refer to the waggle and the stance  before you make the stroke. Most players seem to fix in their minds the  appearance of the angles which are presented by the position of the  arms, legs, and club shaft, and it is largely the desire to retain  these angles which results in their moving their heads and stiffening  their muscles so that there is no freedom in the swing. There is only  one point which vitally affects the stroke, and the only reason why  that should be kept constant is that you are enabled to see your ball  clearly. That is the pivotal point marked at the base of the neck, and  a line drawn from this point to the ball should be at right angles to  the line of flight.\"    James paused for a moment for air, and as he paused Miss Forrester  spoke.    \"This is all gibberish to me,\" she said.    \"Gibberish!\" gasped James. \"I am quoting verbatim from one of the best  authorities on golf.\"    Miss Forrester swung her tennis racket irritably.    \"Golf,\" she said, \"bores me pallid. I think it is the silliest game  ever invented!\"    The trouble about telling a story is that words are so feeble a means  of depicting the supreme moments of life. That is where the artist has  the advantage over the historian. Were I an artist, I should show James  at this point falling backwards with his feet together and his eyes  shut, with a semi-circular dotted line marking the progress of his  flight and a few stars above his head to indicate moral collapse. There  are no words that can adequately describe the sheer, black horror that  froze the blood in his veins as this frightful speech smote his ears.    He had never inquired into Miss Forrester's religious views before, but  he had always assumed that they were sound. And now here she was  polluting the golden summer air with the most hideous blasphemy. It  would be incorrect to say that James's love was turned to hate. He did  not hate Grace. The repulsion he felt was deeper than mere hate. What  he felt was not altogether loathing and not wholly pity. It was a blend  of the two.    There was a tense silence. The listening world stood still. Then,  without a word, James Todd turned and tottered away.           *       *       *       *       *    Peter was working moodily in the twelfth bunker when his friend  arrived. He looked up with a start. Then, seeing that the other was  alone, he came forward hesitatingly.    \"Am I to congratulate you?\"    James breathed a deep breath.    \"You are!\" he said. \"On an escape!\"    \"She refused you?\"    \"She didn't get the chance. Old man, have you ever sent one right up  the edge of that bunker in front of the seventh and just not gone in?\"    \"Very rarely.\"    \"I did once. It was my second shot, from a good lie, with the light  iron, and I followed well through and thought I had gone just too far,  and, when I walked up, there was my ball on the edge of the bunker,  nicely teed up on a chunk of grass, so that I was able to lay it dead  with my mashie-niblick, holing out in six. Well, what I mean to say is,  I feel now as I felt then--as if some unseen power had withheld me in  time from some frightful disaster.\"    \"I know just how you feel,\" said Peter, gravely.    \"Peter, old man, that girl said golf bored her pallid. She said she  thought it was the silliest game ever invented.\" He paused to mark the  effect of his words. Peter merely smiled a faint, wan smile. \"You don't  seem revolted,\" said James.    \"I am revolted, but not surprised. You see, she said the same thing to  me only a few "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#7)"],[1,"em.\"    \"Well, let us press on, Boduoc. I would not that anything should  occur to prevent us starting with the rest in the morning.\"    \"We are walking a good pace now,\" Boduoc said, \"and shall gain but  little by going faster. One cannot run for six hours; and besides  it is as much as we can do to walk fast in the dark. Did we try  to run we should like enough fall over a stump or root, and maybe  not arrive there even though the wolves stopped us not.\"    For two hours more they strode along. Boduoc's eyes had been  trained by many a long night spent among the woods, and dark as it  was beneath the overarching trees, he was able to discern objects  around him, and kept along in his regular stride as surely and  almost as noiselessly as a wild beast; but the four years spent in  the Roman town had impaired Beric's nocturnal vision; and though  he had done much hunting since his return home, he was far from  being able to use his eyes as his companion did, and he more than  once stumbled over the roots that crossed the path.    \"You will be on your head presently,\" Boduoc growled.    \"It is all very well for you, Boduoc, who have the eyes of a cat;  but you must remember we are travelling in the dark, and although  I can make out the trunks on either hand the ground is all black  to me, and I am walking quite at hazard.\"    \"It is not what I should call a light night,\" Boduoc admitted.    \"Well, no, considering that there is no moon, and that the clouds  that were rising when the sun went down have overspread all the  sky. I don't see that it could well be darker.\"    \"Well we will stop at that hut in the little clearing, somewhere  about half a mile on, and get a couple of torches. If you were to  fall and twist your foot you would not be able to hunt tomorrow.\"    \"What is that?\" Beric exclaimed as a distant cry came to their  ears.    \"I think it is the voice of a woman,\" Boduoc said. \"Or maybe it is  one of the spirits of evil.\"    Beric during his stay among the Romans had lost faith in most of  his superstitions. \"Nonsense, Boduoc! it was the cry of a woman; it  came from ahead. Maybe some woman returning late has been attacked  by wolves. Come along,\" he shouted, and he started to run, followed  reluctantly by his companion.    \"Stop, Beric, stop!\" he said in a short time, \"I hear other sounds.\"    \"So do I,\" Beric agreed, but without checking his pace. \"My eyes  may be dull, Boduoc, but they are not so dull as your ears. Why,  don't you know the snarling of wolves when you hear them?\"    Again the loud cry of distress came on the night air. \"They have  not seized her yet,\" Beric said. \"Her first cry would have been her  last had they done so. She must be in that hut, Boduoc, and they  are trying to get at her. Maybe her husband is away.\"    \"It is wolves,\" Boduoc agreed in a tone of relief. \"Since that is  all I am ready for them; but sword and spear are of no avail against  the spirits of the air. We must be careful though, or instead of  us attacking we may be attacked.\"    Beric paid no attention. They had as they passed the hut that  morning stopped for a drink of water there, and he saw now before  his eyes the tall comely young woman with a baby in her arms and  two children hanging to her skirts. In a short time they stood at  the edge of the little clearing by the side of the path. It was  lighter here, and he could make out the outline of the rude hut,  and, as he thought, that of many dark figures moving round it. A  fierce growling and snarling rose from around the hut, with once  or twice a sharp yell of pain.    \"There are half a dozen of them on the roof,\" Boduoc said, \"and  a score or more round the hut. At present they haven't winded us,  for the air is in our faces.\"    \"I think we had best make a rush at them, Boduoc, shouting at the  top of our voices as we go, and bidding the woman stand in readiness  to unbar the door. They will be scared for a moment, not knowing  how many of us there may be, and once inside we shall be safe from  them.\"    \"Let us get as near as we can before we begin to shout, Beric. They  may run back a few paces at our voice, but will speedily rally.\"    Holding their spears in readiness for action they ran forward. When  within thirty yards of the hut Boduoc raised his voice in a wild  yell, Beric adding his cry and then shouting, \"Unbar your door and  stand to close it as we enter.\"    There was, however, no occasion for haste. Boduoc's sudden yell  completely scared the wolves, and with whimpers of dismay they  scattered in all directions. The door opened as Beric and his  companion came up, and they rushed in and closed it after them.  A fire burned on the hearth. A dead wolf lay on the ground, the  children crouched in terror on a pile of rushes, and a woman stood  with a spear in her hand.    \"Thanks to our country's gods you have come!\" she said. \"A few  minutes later and all would have been over with me and my children.  See, one has already made his way through the roof, and in half a  dozen places they have scratched holes well nigh large enough to  pass through.\"    \"We heard your cry,\" Beric said, \"and hastened forward at the top  of our speed.\"    \"It was for you that I called,\" the woman said. \"By what you said  this morning I judged you would be returning about this hour, and  it was in hopes you might hear me that I cried out, for I knew well  that no one else would be likely to be within earshot.\"    \"Where is your husband?\" Beric asked.    \"He started this afternoon for Cardun. He and all the able bodied  men were ordered to assemble there tonight in readiness to begin  the war against the wolves at daybreak. There is no other house  within a mile, and even had they heard me there they could have  given me no assistance, seeing there are but women and children  remaining behind.\"    \"They are coming again,\" Boduoc broke in; \"I can hear their feet  pattering on the dead leaves. Which shall we do, Beric, pile more  wood on the fire, or let it go out altogether? I think that we shall  do better without it; it is from the roof that they will attack,  and if we have a light here we cannot see them till they are ready  to leap down; whereas, if we are in darkness we may be able to make  them out when they approach the holes, or as they pass over any of  the crevices.\"    \"I don't know, Boduoc; I think we shall do better if we have light. We  may not make them out so well, but at least we can use our spears  better than we could in the dark, when we might strike them against  the rafters or thick branches.\"    The woman at once gathered some of the pieces of wood that had  fallen through as the wolves made the holes and put them on the  hearth, where they soon blazed up brightly.    \"I will take this big hole,\" Boduoc said, \"it is the only one by  which they can come down at present. Do you try and prevent them  from enlarging any of the others.\"    There was a sudden thump overhead, followed almost immediately by  several others.    \"They get up by the wood pile,\" the woman said. \"It is against that  side of the hut, and reaches nearly up to the eaves.\"    There was a sharp yell as Boduoc thrust his spear up through the  hole when he saw a pair of eyes, shining in the firelight, appear  at the edge. At the same moment there was a sound of scraping and  scratching at some of the other holes. The roof was constructed  of rough poles laid at short distances apart, and above these were  small branches, on which was a sort of thatch of reeds and rushes.  Standing close under one of the holes Beric could see nothing, but  from the sound of the scratching he could tell from which side the  wolf was at work enlarging it. He carefully thrust the point of  his spear through the branches and gave a sudden lunge upwards.  A fierce yell was heard, followed by the sound of a body rolling  down the roof, and then a struggle accompanied by angry snarling  and growling outside.    \"That is one less, Beric,\" Boduoc said. \"I fancy I only scratched  mine. Ah!\" he exclaimed suddenly, as without the least warning a  wolf sprang down through the hole. Before it could gather its legs  under it for a fresh spring Beric and the woman both thrust their  spears deeply into it, Boduoc keeping his eyes fixed on the hole,  and making a lunge as another wolf peered down in readiness to  spring after the one that had entered.    For hours the fight went on. Gradually the holes, in spite of the  efforts of the defenders, were enlarged, and the position became  more and more critical. At least twenty of the wolves were slain;  but as the attack was kept up as vigorously as at first, it was  evident that fresh reinforcements had arrived to the assailants.    \"We cannot keep them out much longer, Beric,\" Boduoc said at last.  \"It seems to me that our only plan is to fire the hut, and then,  each taking a child, to make a rush across to the trees and climb  them. The sudden burst of fire will drive them back for a little,  and we may make good our retreat to the trees.\"    \"What time is it, think you, Boduoc?\"    \"It must be two or three hours past midnight, and if Borgon carried  out my instructions help ought to be near at hand. I would that we  could let them know of our peril.\"    \"There is a cow horn,\" the woman said, pointing to the corner of  the hut. \"My husband uses it for calling in the cattle.\"    Boduoc seized the horn and blew a deep hollow blast upon it. There  was a sudden pattering of feet overhead and then silence.    \"That has scared them,\" Beric said. \"Blow again, Boduoc; if we can  but gain half an hour our friends may be up.\"    Again and again the hoarse roar of the cow horn rose, but the wolves  speedily recovered from their scare and crowded on the roof.    \"We can't hold out much longer,\" Beric said, as two wolves that  leapt down together had just been despatched. \"Get a brand from  the fire.\" At this moment there was a sudden scuffle overhead, and  the"]]]
