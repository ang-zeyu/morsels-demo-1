You see, it gave him  all of the real work to do. However, Jerry thought of his dear Smiling  Pool, and how terrible it would be if it should smile no more, and so  without another word he set to work.    Now Jerry Muskrat is a great worker, and he had made many long tunnels  into the bank around the Smiling Pool, so he had no doubt but that he  could soon make a hole through this dam. But almost right away he found  trouble. Yes, Sir, Jerry had hardly begun before he found real trouble.  You see, that dam was made mostly of sticks instead of mud, and so,  instead of digging his way in as he would have done into the bank of the  Smiling Pool, he had to stop every few minutes to gnaw off sticks that  were in the way.    It was hard work, the hardest kind of hard work. But Jerry Muskrat is  the kind that is the more determined to do the work the harder the work  is to be done. And so, while Grandfather Frog sat on one end of the dam  and pretended to keep watch, but really took a nap in the warm sunshine,  and while Spotty the Turtle sat on the other end of the dam doing the  same thing, and while Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter swam around in the  strange pond and enjoyed themselves, Jerry Muskrat worked and worked and  worked. And just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun started down behind the  Purple Hills, Jerry broke through into the strange pond, and the water  began to run in the Laughing Brook once more.        CHAPTER XX: Jerry Has A Dreadful Disappointment     There's nothing in this world that's sure,    No matter how we scheme and plan.   We simply have to be content    With doing just the best we can.    Jerry Muskrat had curled himself up for the night, so tired that he  could hardly keep his eyes open long enough to find a comfortable place  to sleep. But he was happy. Yes, indeed, Jerry was happy. He could hear  the Laughing Brook beginning to laugh again. It was just a little low,  gurgling laugh, but Jerry knew that in a little while it would grow  into the full laugh that makes music through the Green Forest and puts  happiness into the hearts of all who hear it.    So Jerry was happy, for was it not because of him that the Laughing  Brook was beginning to laugh? He had worked all the long day to make a  hole through the dam which some one had built across the Laughing Brook  and so stopped its laughter. Now the water was running again, and soon  the new, strange pond behind the dam there in the Green Forest would  be gone, and the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool would be their own  beautiful selves once more. It was because he had worked so hard all day  that he was going to sleep now. Usually he would rather sleep a part of  the day and be abroad at night.    Very pleasant dreams had Jerry Muskrat that night, dreams of the dear  Smiling Pool, smiling just as it had as long as Jerry could remember,  before this trouble had come. He was still dreaming when Spotty the  Turtle found him and waked him, for it was broad daylight. Jerry yawned  and stretched, and then he lay still for a minute to listen to the  pleasant murmur of the Laughing Brook. But there wasn't any pleasant  murmur. There wasn't any sound at all. Jerry began to wonder if he  really was awake after all. He looked at Spotty the Turtle, and he knew  then that he was, for Spotty's face had such a worried look.    \"Get up, Jerry Muskrat, and come look at the hole you made yesterday in  the dam. You couldn't have done your work very well, for the hole has  filled up so that the water does not run any more,\" said Spotty.    \"I did do it well!\" snapped Jerry crossly. \"I did it just as well as  I know how. You lazy folks who just sit and take sun-naps while  you pretend to keep watch had better get busy and do a little work  yourselves, if you don't like the way I work.\"    \"I--I beg your pardon, Jerry Muskrat. I didn't mean to say just that,\"  replied Spotty. \"You see, we are all worried. We thought last night that  by this morning the Laughing Brook would be full of water again, and we  could go back to the Smiling Pool as soon as we felt like it, and here  it is as bad as ever.\"    \"Perhaps the trouble is just that some sticks and grass drifted down in  the water and filled up the hole I made; that must be the trouble,\" said  Jerry hopefully, as he hurried towards the dam.    First he carefully examined it from the Laughing Brook side. Then he  dived down under water on the other side. He was gone a long time, and  Billy Mink was just getting ready to dive to see what had become of him  when he came up again.    \"What is the trouble?\" cried Spotty the Turtle and Grandfather Frog and  Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter together. \"Is the hole filled up with  stuff that has drifted in?\"    Jerry shook his head, as he slowly climbed out of the water. \"No,\" said  he. \"No, it isn't filled with drift stuff brought down by the water. It  is filled with sticks and mud that somebody has put there. Somebody has  filled up the hole that I worked so hard to make yesterday, and it will  take me all day to open it up again.\"    Then Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle and Billy Mink and Little  Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat stared at one mother, and for a long time no  one said a word.        CHAPTER XXI: Jerry Muskrat Keeps Watch     \"The way in which to find things out,    And what goes on all round about,    Is just to keep my two eyes peeled    And two ears all the time unsealed.\"    So said Jerry Muskrat, as he settled himself comfortably on one end  of the new dam across the Laughing Brook deep in the Green Forest and  watched the dark shadows creep farther and farther out into the strange  pond made by the new dam.    \"I'm going to find out who it is that built this dam, and who it is that  filled the hole I made in it! I'm going to find out if I have to move up  here and live all summer!\" The way in which Jerry said this and snapped  his teeth together showed that he meant just what he said.    You see Jerry had spent another long, weary day opening the hole in the  dam once more, only to have it closed again while he slept. That had  been enough for Jerry. He hadn't tried again. Instead he had made up  his mind that he would find out who was playing such a trick on him. He  would just watch until they came, and then if they were not bigger than  he, or there were not too many of them, he would--well, the way Jerry  gritted and clashed those sharp teeth of his sounded as if he meant to  do something pretty bad.    Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter had given up in disgust and started for  the Big River. They are great travelers, anyway, and so didn't mind so  much because there was no longer water enough in the Laughing Brook and  the Smiling Pool. Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, who are such  very, very slow travelers, had decided that the Big River was too far  away, and so they would stay and live in the strange pond for a while,  though it wasn't nearly so nice as their dear Smiling Pool. They bad  gone to sleep now, each in his own secret place where he would be safe  for the night.    So Jerry Muskrat sat alone and watched. The black shadows crept farther  and farther across the pond and grew blacker and blacker. Jerry didn't  mind this, because, as you know, his eyes are made for seeing in the  dark, and he dearly loves the night. Jerry had sat there a long  time without moving. He was listening and watching. By and by he saw  something that made him draw in his breath and anger leap into his eyes.  It was a little silver line on the water, and it was coming straight  towards the dam where he sat. Jerry knew that it was made by some one  swimming.    \"Ha!\" said Jerry. \"Now we shall see!\"    Nearer and nearer came the silver line. Then Jerry made out the head of  the swimmer. Suddenly all the anger left Jerry. He didn't have room for  anger; a great fear had crowded it out. The head was bigger than that of  any Muskrat Jerry had ever seen. It was bigger than the head of any of  Billy Mink's relatives. It was the head of a stranger, a stranger so big  that Jerry felt very, very small and hoped with all his might that the  stranger would not see him.    Jerry held his breath as the stranger swam past and then climbed out on  the dam. He looked very much like Jerry himself, only ever and ever so  much bigger. And his tail! Jerry had never seen such a tail. It was very  broad and flat. Suddenly the big stranger turned and looked straight at  Jerry.    \"Hello, Jerry Muskrat!\" said he. \"Don't you know me?\"    Jerry was too frightened to speak.    \"I'm your big cousin from the North; I'm Paddy the Beaver, and if  you leave my dam alone, I think we'll be good friends,\" continued the  stranger.    \"I--I--I hope so,\" said Jerry in a very faint voice, trying to be  polite, but with his teeth chattering with fear.        CHAPTER XXII: Jerry Loses His Fear     \"Oh, tell me, you and you and you,     If it may hap you've ever heard    Of all that wond'rous is and great     The greatest is the spoken word?\"    It's true. It's the truest thing that ever was. If you don't believe  it, you just go ask Jerry Muskrat. He'll tell you it's true, and Jerry  knows. You see, it's this way: Words are more than just sounds. Oh, my,  yes! They are little messengers, and once they have been sent out, you  can't call them back. No, Sir, you can't call them back, and sometimes  that is a very sad thing, because--well, you see these little messengers  always carry something to some one else, and that something may be anger  or hate or fear or an untruth, and it is these things which make most of  the trouble in this world."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5113"],[0,"The Confessions of a Beachcomber (#7)"],[1,"folks, and to make clear remarks  in future pages upon the different features of the domain over which the  Beachcomber exercises jurisdiction. Not to many men is permitted the  privilege of choosing for his day's excursion from among so many  beautiful spots, certain in the knowledge that to whichsoever he may  elect to flutter his handkerchief is reserved for his delight; certain  that the sands will be free from the traces of any other human being;  certain that no sound save those of nature will break in upon his musings  and meditations.    Purtaboi, the first and the nearest of the satellites, lies  three-quarters of a mile from the middle of the sweep of Brammo  Bay--always in view through the tracery of the melaleuca trees.  Mung-um-gnackum and Kumboola, to the south-west, are linked at low-water  spring tides to Dunk Island and to each other; and Wooln-garin, to the  south-east, is separated from the rocky cliffs and ledges of the island  by 300 yards of deep and swiftly-flowing water.    Purtaboi--dainty and unique--its hill crowned with low-growing trees and  shrubs, a ruddy precipice, groups of pandanus palms, beach lined with  casuarinas, banks of snow-white coral debris, ridge of sharped-edged  rocks jutting out to the north-western cove and out-lying reef of coral,  tangle of orchids and scrub all in miniature--save the orchids--gigantic  and gross and profuse of old-gold bloom. In October and November hosts of  sea-birds come hither to nest, and so also do nutmeg or Torres Straits  pigeons, blue doves, peaceful doves, honey-eaters, wood-swallows, the  blue reef heron, and occasionally the little black cormorant. The  large-billed shore plover (ESACUS MAGNIROSTRIS) deposits her single egg  on the sand, merely carelessly whisking aside the casuarina needles for  its reception.    Hundreds of terns (six species) lay their eggs among the tinkling coral  chips, and discarding all attempts at concealment, practise artistic  deception. So perfect is the artifice that the eggs are frequently the  least conspicuous of the elements of the banks of drift, broken coral and  bleached shells. Not until each square yard is steadfastly inspected can  they be detected, though there may be dozens around one's feet, the  colours--creamy white with grey and brown and purple spots, and blotches  and scribblings--blending perfectly with their environment. The eggs, by  the way, are a great delicacy, sweet, nutty, and absolutely devoid of  fishy flavour. When the downy young are hatched they, too, are almost  invisible. They cunningly lie motionless, though within a few inches of  your hand, and remain perfectly passive when lifted. Snoodling beside  lumps of coral or beneath weather-beaten drift-wood, they afford  startling proof of the effect of sympathetic coloration. When one stoops  to pick up a piece of wood, whitened and roughened by the salt of the  sea, and finds that more than half its apparent bulk is made up of  several infants in soft swaddles, crowded together into a homogeneous  mass, the result is pleasing astonishment. Only when individuals of the  group move do they become visible to their natural enemies. These tender  young birds enjoy no protection nor any of the comfort of a nest; and if  they were not endowed from the moment of birth with rare consciousness of  their helplessness, the species, no doubt, would speedily become  exterminated, for keen-sighted hawks hover about, picking up those which,  failing to obey the first law of nature, reveal themselves by movement.  If the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, what is the provision of  Nature which enables so tender a thing as a young bird, a mere helpless  ball of creamy fluff, to withstand the frizzling heat with which the sun  bleaches the broken coral? Many do avail themselves of the meagre shadow  of shells and lumps of coral, but the majority are exposed to the direct  rays of the sun, which brings the coral to such a heat that even the  hardened beachcomber walks thereon with \"uneasy steps,\" reminding him of  another outcast who used that oft-quoted staff as a support over the  \"burning marl.\" Gilbert White relates that a pair of fly-catchers which  inadvertently placed their nests in an intolerably hot situation hovered  over it \"all the hotter hours, while with wings expanded and mouths  gaping for breath, they screened the heat from their suffering young.\"  Parental duty of the like nature does not appear to be practised for the  benefit of the young tern; but they are well fed with what may be  considered thirst-provoking food. Thirst does occasionally overcome the  instinct which the young birds obey by absolute stillness, and a  proportion of those which give way to the ever-present temptation of the  sea falls to the lot of the hawks. Mere fluffy toddlers, with mouths  gaping with thirst, slide and scramble down the coral banks, waddle with  uncertain steps across the strip of smooth sand to be rolled over and  over in their helplessness by the gentle break of the sea. They cool  their panting bodies by a series of queer, sprawling marine gymnastics,  swim about buoyantly for a few minutes, are tumbled on to the sand, and  waddle with contented cheeps each back to its own birthplace among  hundreds of highly-decorated eggs, and hundreds of infants like unto  themselves.    The parents of the white-shafted ternlet (STERNA SINENSIS), the most  sylph-like of birds, with others of the family, ever on the look-out,  follow in circling, screaming mobs the disturbance on the surface of the  sea caused by small fish vainly endeavouring to elude the crafty bonito  and porpoise, and take ample supplies to the ever-hungry young. How is it  that the hundreds of pairs recognise among the hundreds of fluffy young,  identical in size and colour, each their particular care?    The picture \"where terns lay\" testifies to the solicitude of Nature for  the preservation of types. The apparent primary carelessness of the terns  in depositing their eggs is shown, when the chicks are hatched, to have  been artfulness of a high order. At least a dozen, if not more, young  birds were sharply focused by the camera, but so perfectly do their  neutral tints blend with the groundwork of coral, shells and sand that  only three or four are actually discernible, and these are perplexingly  inconspicuous. A microscopic examination of the photograph is necessary  to differentiate the helpless birds from their surroundings.    On another island within the Barrier Reef several species of sea-birds  spontaneously adapted themselves to altered circumstances. They, in  consonance with the general habits of the species, were wont to lay their  eggs carelessly on the sand or shingle, without pretence of nests. A  meat-loving pioneer introduced goats to the island, the continual  parading about of which so disturbed the birds, and deprived them of  their hope of posterity, that they took to the building of nests on dwarf  trees, out of the way of the goats. That birds unaccustomed to the  building of nests should acquire the habit, illustrates the depths of  Nature's promptings for the preservation of species; or is it that the  faculty existed as an hereditary trait, was abandoned only when its  exercise was unnecessary, and resumed when there was conspicuous occasion  for it? On a neighbouring island of the same group unstocked with goats,  no change in the habits of the birds has taken place.    Among the rocks of Purtaboi, in cool dark grottoes, the brown-winged tern  rears her young. She often permits herself to be trapped rather than  indicate her presence by voluntary flight. One of the most graceful of  the sea-swallows this. Brown of back and greenish-white under surface;  noisy, too, for it \"yaps\" as a terrier whensoever intruders approach the  island during the brooding season; and its puff-ball chicken, crouching  in dim recesses, takes the bluish-grey hue of the rock.    The Blue Reef heron builds a rough nest of twigs on the ledges of the  rocks, sometimes at the roots of the bronze orchid (DENDROBIUM  UNDULATUM), and endeavours to scare away intruders by harsh squawks,  stupidly betraying the presence of pale blue eggs or helpless brood. When  the blue heron flies with his long neck stiffly tucked between his  shoulders, he is anything but graceful; but under other circumstances he  is not an ungainly bird. Occasionally my casual observations are made  afar off, with the medium of a telescope. Then the birds are seen  behaving naturally, and without fear or self-consciousness. The other day  the cute attitudes of a beach curlew interested me, as he stood upon a  stone just awash, and ever and anon picked up a crab. A blue heron  flapped down beside him, and the curlew skipped off to another rock. In  a minute the heron straightened his neck, poised its long beak for  striking, and brought up a wriggling fish, which with a jerk of its head  it turned end for end and swallowed. Another actor came within the field  of the glass--the mate of the heron, alighting on the stone beside her  lord and master. He was in a peckish humour, and instantly the tufts on  his shoulders, the long feathers on the neck, and the rudimentary crest  were angrily erected, and he made a peevish snap at her. You can imagine  his reproof--\"Get away from this. Don't crowd a fellow. Go to a rock of  your own. This is my place. You spoil my sport!\" Then, remembering that  domestic tiffs were not edifying to strangers--and there was the sober  brown curlew looking on--the bird let his angry feathers subside, and made  way for his spouse on the best point of the rock. Each on one leg, they  stood shoulder to shoulder, the very embodiment of connubial bliss. I  noticed, too, that the mistress was allowed to fish to her heart's  content, the master never raising a feather in remonstrance, though she  gobbled up all that came along.
