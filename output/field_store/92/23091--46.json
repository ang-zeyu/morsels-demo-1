A Lens cannot be brought into being except to match some  one living personality; a short time after you pass into the next cycle  your Lens will disintegrate.\"    \"Wonderful!\" Samms breathed, in awe. \"But there's one thing ... these  things are ... priceless, and there will be millions of them to  make ... and you don't....\"    \"What will we get out of it, you mean?\" The Arisian seemed to smile.    \"Exactly.\" Samms blushed, but held his ground. \"Nobody does anything  for nothing. Altruism is beautiful in theory, but it has never been  known to work in practice. I will pay a tremendous price--any price  within reason or possibility--for the Lens; but I will have to know  what that price is to be.\"    \"It will be heavier than you think, or can at present realize; although  not in the sense you fear.\" Mentor's thought was solemnity itself.  \"Whoever wears the Lens of Arisia will carry a load that no weaker mind  could bear. The load of authority; of responsibility; of knowledge  that would wreck completely any mind of lesser strength. Altruism? No.  Nor is it a case of good against evil, as you so firmly believe. Your  mental picture of glaring white and of unrelieved black is not a true  picture. Neither absolute evil nor absolute good do or can exist.\"    \"But that would make it still worse!\" Samms protested. \"In that case,  I can't see any reason at all for your exerting yourselves--putting  yourselves out--for us.\"    \"There is, however, reason enough; although I am not sure that I can  make it as clear to you as I would wish. There are in fact three  reasons; any one of which would justify us in exerting--would compel  us to exert--the trivial effort involved in the furnishing of Lenses  to your Galactic Patrol. First, there is nothing either intrinsically  right or intrinsically wrong about liberty or slavery, democracy or  autocracy, freedom of action or complete regimentation. It seems to us,  however, that the greatest measure of happiness and of well-being for  the greatest number of entities, and therefore the optimum advancement  toward whatever sublime Goal it is toward which this cycle of existence  is trending in the vast and unknowable Scheme of Things, is to be  obtained by securing for each and every individual the greatest amount  of mental and physical freedom compatible with the public welfare. We  of Arisia are only a small part of this cycle; and, as goes the whole,  so goes in greater or lesser degree each of the parts. Is it impossible  for you, a fellow citizen of this cycle-universe, to believe that  such fulfillment alone would be ample compensation for a much greater  effort?\"    \"I never thought of it in that light....\" It was hard for Samms to  grasp the concept; he never did understand it thoroughly. \"I begin to  see, I think ... at least, I believe you.\"    \"Second, we have a more specific obligation in that the life of many,  many worlds has sprung from Arisian seed. Thus, _in loco parentis_, we  would be derelict indeed if we refused to act. And third, you yourself  spend highly valuable time and much effort in playing chess. Why do you  do it? What do you get out of it?\"    \"Why, I ... uh ... mental exercise, I suppose ... I like it!\"    \"Just so. And I am sure that one of your very early philosophers came  to the conclusion that a fully competent mind, from a study of one  fact or artifact belonging to any given universe, could construct  or visualize that universe, from the instant of its creation to its  ultimate end?\"    \"Yes. At least, I have heard the proposition stated, but I have never  believed it possible.\"    \"It is not possible simply because no fully competent mind ever has  existed or ever will exist. A mind can become fully competent only by  the acquisition of infinite knowledge, which would require infinite  time as well as infinite capacity. Our equivalent of your chess,  however, is what we call the 'Visualization of the Cosmic All'. In my  visualization a descendant of yours named Clarrissa MacDougall will, in  a store called Brenleer's upon the planet ... but no, let us consider  a thing nearer at hand and concerning you personally, so that its  accuracy will be subject to check. Where you will be and exactly what  you will be doing, at some definite time in the future. Five years, let  us say?\"    \"Go ahead. If you can do that you're _good_.\"    \"Five Tellurian calendar years then, from the instant of your passing  through the screen of 'The Hill' on this present journey, you will  be ... allow me, please, a moment of thought ... you will be in a  barber shop not yet built; the address of which is to be fifteen  hundred fifteen Twelfth Avenue, Spokane, Washington, North America,  Tellus. The barber's name will be Antonio Carbonero and he will be  left-handed. He will be engaged in cutting your hair. Or rather, the  actual cutting will have been done and he will be shaving, with a razor  trade-marked 'Jensen-King-Byrd', the short hairs in front of your  left ear. A comparatively small, quadrupedal, grayish-striped entity,  of the race called 'cat'--a young cat, this one will be, and called  Thomas, although actually of the female sex--will jump into your lap,  addressing you pleasantly in a language with which you yourself are  only partially familiar. You call it mewing and purring, I believe?\"    \"Yes,\" the flabbergasted Samms managed to say. \"Cats do  purr--especially kittens.\"    \"Ah--very good. Never having met a cat personally, I am gratified at  your corroboration of my visualization. This female youth erroneously  called Thomas, somewhat careless in computing the elements of her  trajectory, will jostle slightly the barber's elbow with her tail; thus  causing him to make a slight incision, approximately three millimeters  long, parallel to and just above your left cheek-bone. At the precise  moment in question, the barber will be applying a styptic pencil to  this insignificant wound. This forecast is, I trust, sufficiently  detailed so that you will have no difficulty in checking its accuracy  or its lack thereof?\"    \"Detailed! _Accuracy!_\" Samms could scarcely think. \"But listen--not  that I want to cross you up deliberately, but I'll tell you now that a  man doesn't like to get sliced by a barber, even such a little nick as  that. I'll remember that address--and the cat--and I'll never go into  the place!\"    \"Every event does affect the succession of events,\" Mentor  acknowledged, equably enough. \"Except for this interview, you would  have been in New Orleans at that time, instead of in Spokane. I have  considered every pertinent factor. You will be a busy man. Hence, while  you will think of this matter frequently and seriously during the near  future, you will have forgotten it in less than five years. You will  remember it only at the touch of the astringent, whereupon you will  give voice to certain self-derogatory and profane remarks.\"    \"I ought to,\" Samms grinned; a not-too-pleasant grin. He had been  appalled by the quality of mind able to do what Mentor had just done;  he was now more than appalled by the Arisian's calm certainty that what  he had foretold in such detail would in every detail come to pass.  \"If, after all this Spokane--let a tiger-striped kitten jump into my  lap--let a left-handed Tony Carbonero nick me--uh-uh, Mentor, UH-UH!  _If_ I do, I'll deserve to be called everything I can think of!\"    \"These that I have mentioned, the gross occurrences, are problems  only for inexperienced thinkers.\" Mentor paid no attention to Samms'  determination never to enter that shop. \"The real difficulties lie  in the fine detail, such as the length, mass, and exact place and  position of landing, upon apron or floor, of each of your hairs as  it is severed. Many factors are involved. Other clients passing  by--opening and shutting doors--air currents--sunshine--wind--pressure,  temperature, humidity. The exact fashion in which the barber will flick  his shears, which in turn depends upon many other factors--what he will  have been doing previously, what he will have eaten and drunk, whether  or not his home life will have been happy ... you little realize,  youth, what a priceless opportunity this will be for me to check the  accuracy of my visualization. I shall spend many periods upon the  problem. I cannot attain perfect accuracy, of course. Ninety nine point  nine nines percent, let us say ... or perhaps ten nines ... is all that  I can reasonably expect....\"    \"But, Mentor!\" Samms protested. \"I can't help you on a thing like that!  How can I know or report the exact mass, length, and orientation of  single hairs?\"    \"You cannot; but, since you will be wearing your Lens, I myself can  and will compare minutely my visualization with the actuality. For  know, youth, that wherever any Lens is, there can any Arisian be if he  so desires. And now, knowing that fact, and from your own knowledge  of the satisfactions to be obtained from chess and other such mental  activities, and from the glimpses you have had into my own mind, do you  retain any doubts that we Arisians will be fully compensated for the  trifling effort involved in furnishing whatever number of Lenses may be  required?\"    \"I have no more doubts. But this Lens ... I'm getting more afraid of  it every minute. I see that it is a perfect identification; I can  understand that it can be a perfect telepath. But is it something else,  as well? If it has other powers ... what are they?\"    \"I cannot tell you; or, rather, I will not.

In many cases the artisan  who is dependent upon this action of microscopic life is unaware  of the fact. His processes are those which experience has taught  produce desired results, but, nevertheless, his dependence upon  bacteria is none the less fundamental.    BACTERIA IN THE FERMENTATIVE INDUSTRIES.    We may notice, first, several miscellaneous instances of the  application of bacteria to various fermentative industries where  their aid is of more or less value to man. In some of the examples  to be mentioned the influence of bacteria is profound and  fundamental, while in others it is only incidental. The  fermentative industries of civilization are gigantic in extent,  and have come to be an important factor in modern civilized life.  The large part of the fermentation is based upon the growth of a  class of microscopic plants which we call yeasts. Bacteria and  yeasts are both microscopic plants, and perhaps somewhat closely  related to each other. The botanist finds a difference between  them, based upon their method of multiplication, and therefore  places them in different classes (Fig. 2, page 19). In their  general power of producing chemical changes in their food  products, yeasts agree closely with bacteria, though the kinds of  chemical changes are different. The whole of the great  fermentative industries, in which are invested hundreds of  millions of dollars, is based upon chemical decompositions  produced by microscopic plants. In the great part of commercial  fermentations alcohol is the product desired, and alcohol, though  it is sometimes produced by bacteria, is in commercial quantities  produced only by yeasts. Hence it is that, although the  fermentations produced by bacteria are more common in Nature than  those produced by yeasts and give rise to a much larger number of  decomposition products, still their commercial aspect is decidedly  less important than that of yeasts. Nevertheless, bacteria are not  without their importance in the ordinary fermentative processes.  Although they are of no importance as aids in the common  fermentative processes, they are not infrequently the cause of  much trouble. In the fermentation of malt to produce beer, or  grape juice to produce wine, it is the desire of the brewer and  vintner to have this fermentation produced by pure yeasts, unmixed  with bacteria. If the yeast is pure the fermentation is uniform  and successful. But the brewer and vintner have long known that  the fermentation is frequently interfered with by irregularities.  The troubles which arise have long been known, but the  bacteriologist has finally discovered their cause, and in general  their remedy. The cause of the chief troubles which arise in the  fermentation is the presence of contaminating bacteria among the  yeasts. These bacteria have been more or less carefully studied by  bacteriologists, and their effect upon the beer or wine  determined. Some of them produce acid and render the products  sour; others make them bitter; others, again, produce a slimy  material which makes the wine or beer \"ropy.\" Something like a  score of bacteria species have been found liable to occur in the  fermenting material and destroy the value of the product of both  the wine maker and the beer brewer. The species of bacteria which  infect and injure wine are different from those which infect and  injure beer. They are ever present as possibilities in the great  alcoholic fermentations. They are dangers which must be guarded  against. In former years the troubles from these sources were much  greater than they are at present. Since it has been demonstrated  that the different imperfections in the fermentative process are  due to bacterial impurities, commonly in the yeasts which are used  to produce the fermentation, methods of avoiding them are readily  devised. To-day the vintner has ready command of processes for  avoiding the troubles which arise from bacteria, and the brewer is  always provided with a microscope to show him the presence or  absence of the contaminating bacteria. While, then, the alcoholic  fermentations are not dependent upon bacteria, the proper  management of these fermentations requires a knowledge of their  habits and characters.    There are certain other fermentative processes of more or less  importance in their commercial aspects, which are directly  dependent upon bacterial action, Some of them we should  unhesitatingly look upon as fermentations, while others would  hardly be thought of as belonging to the fermentation industries.    VINEGAR.    The commercial importance of the manufacture of vinegar, though  large, does not, of course, compare in extent with that of the  alcoholic fermentations. Vinegar is a weak solution of acetic  acid, together with various other ingredients which have come from  the materials furnishing the acid. In the manufacture of vinegar,  alcohol is always used as the source of the acetic acid. The  production of acetic acid from alcohol is a simple oxidation. The  equation C2H6O + O2 = C2H4O2 + H2O shows the chemical change that  occurs. This oxidation can be brought about by purely chemical  means. While alcohol will not readily unite with oxygen under  common conditions, if the alcohol is allowed to pass over a bit of  platinum sponge the union readily occurs and acetic acid results.  This method of acetic-acid production is possible experimentally,  but is impracticable on any large scale. In the ordinary  manufacture of vinegar the oxidation is a true fermentation, and  brought about by the growth of bacteria.    In the commercial manufacture of vinegar several different weak  alcoholic solutions are used. The most common of these are  fermented malt, weak wine, cider, and sometimes a weak solution of  spirit to which is added sugar and malt. If these solutions are  allowed to stand for a time in contact with air, they slowly turn  sour by the gradual conversion of the alcohol into acetic acid. At  the close of the process practically all of the alcohol has  disappeared. Ordinarily, however, not all of it has been converted  into acetic acid, for the oxidation does not all stop at this  step. As the oxidation goes on, some of the acid is oxidized into  carbonic dioxide, which is, of course, dissipated at once into the  air, and if the process is allowed to continue unchecked for a  long enough period much of the acetic acid will be lost in this  way.    The oxidation of the alcohol in all commercial production of  vinegar is brought about by the growth of bacteria in the liquid.  When the vinegar production is going on properly, there is formed  on the top of the liquid a dense felted mass known as the \"mother  of vinegar.\" This mass proves to be made of bacteria which have  the power of absorbing oxygen from the air, or, at all events, of  causing the alcohol to unite with oxygen. It was at first thought  that a single species of bacterium was thus the cause of the  oxidation of alcohol, and this was named Mycoderma aceti. But  further study has shown that several have the power, and that even  in the commercial manufacture of vinegar several species play a  part (Fig. 18), although the different species are not yet very  thoroughly studied. Each appears to act best under different  conditions. Some of them act slowly, and others rapidly, the slow-  growing species appearing to produce the larger amount of acid in  the end. After the amount of acetic acid reaches a certain  percentage, the bacteria are unable to produce more, even though  there be alcohol still left unoxidized. A percentage as high as  fourteen per cent, commonly destroys all their power of growth.  The production of the acid is wholly dependent upon the growth of  the bacteria, and the secret of the successful vinegar manufacture  is the skilful manipulation of these bacteria so as to keep them  in the purest condition and to give them the best opportunity for  growth.    One method of vinegar manufacture which is quite rapid is carried  on in a slightly different manner. A tall cylindrical chamber is  filled with wood shavings, and a weak solution of alcohol is  allowed to trickle slowly through it. The liquid after passing  over the shavings comes out after a number of hours well charged  with acetic acid. This process at first sight appears to be a  purely chemical one, and reminds us of the oxidation which occurs  when alcohol is allowed to pass over a platinum sponge. It has  been claimed, indeed, that this is a chemical oxidation in which  bacteria play no part. But this appears to be an error. It is  always found necessary in this method to start the process by  pouring upon the shavings some warm vinegar. Unless in this way  the shavings become charged with the vinegar-holding bacteria the  alcohol will not undergo oxidation during its passage over them,  and after the bacteria thus introduced have grown enough to coat  the shavings thoroughly the acetic-acid production is much more  rapid than at first. If vinegar is allowed to trickle slowly down  a suspended string, so that its bacteria may distribute themselves  through the string, and then alcohol be allowed to trickle over it  in the same way, the oxidation takes place and acetic acid is  formed. From the accumulation of such facts it has come to be  recognised that all processes for the commercial manufacture of  vinegar depend upon the action of bacteria. While the oxidation of  alcohol into acetic acid may take place by purely chemical means,  these processes are not practical on a large scale, and vinegar  manufacturers everywhere depend upon bacteria as their agents in  producing the oxidation. These bacteria, several species in all,  feed upon the nitrogenous matter in the fermenting mass and  produce the desired change in the alcohol.    This vinegar fermentation is subject to certain irregularities,  and the vinegar manufacturers can not always"]]]
