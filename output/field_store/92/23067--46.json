Today, but few overland express trains, hauled by  giant locomotives over heavy steel rails on a rock-ballasted roadbed  average more than thirty miles per hour between the Missouri and the  Pacific Coast.    The news of the election of Lincoln in November 1860, and President  Buchanan's last message a month later were carried through in eight  days.    Late in the winter and early in the spring of 1861, just prior to the  beginning of the war, many good records were made with urgent Government  dispatches. News of the firing upon Fort Sumter was taken through in  eight days and fourteen hours. From then on, while the Pony Express  service continued, the business men and public officials of California  began giving prize money to the Company, to be awarded those riders who  made the best time carrying war news. On one occasion they raised a  purse of three hundred dollars for the star rider when a pouch  containing a number of Chicago papers full of information from the South  arrived at Sacramento a day ahead of schedule.    That these splendid achievements could never have been attained without  a wonderful degree of enthusiasm and loyalty on the part of the men,  scarcely needs asserting. The pony riders were highly respected by the  stage and freight employees--in fact by all respectable men throughout  the West. Nor were they honored merely for what they did; they were the  sort of men who command respect. To assist a rider in any way was deemed  a high honor; to do aught to retard him was the limit of wrong-doing, a  woeful offense. On the first trip west-bound, the rider between Folsom  and Sacramento was thrown, receiving a broken leg. Shortly after the  accident, a Wells Fargo stage happened along, and a special agent of  that Company, who chanced to be a passenger, seeing the predicament,  volunteered to finish the run. This he did successfully, reaching  Sacramento only ninety minutes late. Such instances are typical of the  manly cooperation that made the Pony Express the true success that it  was.    Mark Twain, who made a trip across the continent in 1860 has left this  glowing account[14] of a pony and rider that he saw while traveling  overland in a stage coach:    We had a consuming desire from the beginning, to see a pony rider; but  somehow or other all that passed us, and all that met us managed to  streak by in the night and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the  swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out  of the windows. But now we were expecting one along every moment, and  would see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:    \"Here he comes!\"    Every neck is stretched further and every eye strained wider away across  the endless dead level of the prairie, a black speck appears against the  sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well I should think so! In a second  it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, rising and  falling--sweeping toward us nearer and nearer growing more and more  distinct, more and more sharply defined--nearer and still nearer, and  the flutter of hoofs comes faintly to the ear--another instant a whoop  and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider's hands but no  reply and man and horse burst past our excited faces and go winging away  like the belated fragment of a storm!    So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for a  flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail sack after  the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted whether  we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.        [9] This was the same pledge which the original firm had required of its  men. Both Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and the C. O. C. and P. P. Exp.  Co., which they incorporated, adhered to a rigid observance of the  Sabbath. They insisted on their men doing as little work as possible on  that day, and had them desist from work whenever possible. And they  stuck faithfully to these policies. Probably no concern ever won a  higher and more deserved reputation for integrity in the fulfillment of  its contracts and for business reliability than Russell, Majors, and  Waddell.    [10] Exact figures are not obtainable for the west bound mail but it was  probably not so heavy.    At this time--Sept., 1861--the telegraph had been extended from the  Missouri to Fort Kearney, Nebraska, and letter pouches from the Pony  Express were sent by overland stage from Kearney to Atchison. Messages  of grave concern were wired as soon as this station was reached.    [11] These were executive divisions and not to be confused with the  riders' divisions. The latter were merely the stations separating each  man's \"run.\"    [12] Slade was afterward hanged by vigilantes in Virginia City, Montana.  The authentic story of his life surpasses in romance and tragedy most of  the pirate tales of fiction.    [13] The dispatch was taken from the main line to the Colorado capital  by special service. Denver, it will be remembered, was not on the  regular \"Pony route,\" which ran north of that city. There was then no  telegraph in operation west of the Missouri River in Kansas or Nebraska.    [14] Roughing It.          Chapter V    California and the Secession Menace      When the Southern states withdrew, a conspiracy was on foot to force  California out of the Union, and organize a new Republic of the Pacific  with the Sierra Madre and the Rocky Mountains for its Eastern boundary.  This proposed commonwealth, when once erected, and when it had  subjugated all Union men in the West who dared oppose it, would  eventually unite with the Confederacy; and in event of the latter's  success--which at the opening of the war to many seemed certain--the  territory of the Confederate States of America would embrace the entire  Southwest, and stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Aside from its  general plans, the exact details of this plot are of course impossible  to secure. But that the conspiracy existed has never been disproved.    That the rebel sympathizers in California were plotting, as soon as the  War began, to take the Presidio at the entrance to the Golden Gate,  together with the forts on Alcatraz Island, the Custom House, the Mint,  the Post Office, and all United States property, and then having made  the formation of their Republic certain, invade the Mexican State of  Sonora and annex it to the new commonwealth, has never been gainsaid.  That these conspiracies existed and were held in grave seriousness is  revealed by the official correspondence of that time. That they had been  fomenting for many months is apparently revealed by this additional  fact: during Buchanan's administration, John B. Floyd, a southern man  who gave up his position to fight for the Confederacy, was Secretary of  War. When the Rebellion started, it was found[15] that Floyd, while in  office, had removed 135,430 firearms, together with much ammunition and  heavy ordnance, from the big Government arsenal at Springfield,  Massachusetts, and distributed them at various points in the South and  Southwest. Of this number, fifty thousand[16] were sent to California  where twenty-five thousand muskets had already been stored. And all this  was done underhandedly, without the knowledge of Congress.    California was unfortunate in having as a representative in the United  States Senate at this time, William Gwin, also a man of southern birth  who had cast his fortunes in the Golden State at the outset, when the  gold boom was on. Until secession was imminent, Gwin served his adopted  state well enough. His encouragement of the Pony Express enterprise has  already been pointed out. It is doubtful if he were statesman enough to  have foreseen the significant part this organization was to play in the  early stages of the War. Otherwise his efforts in its behalf must have  been lacking--though the careers of political adventurers like Gwin are  full of strange inconsistencies[17].    Speaking in the Senate, on December 12, 1859, Gwin declared, that he  believed that \"all slave holding states of this confederacy can  establish a separate and independent government that will be impregnable  to the assaults of all foreign enemies.\" He further went on to show that  they had the power to do it, and asserted that if the southern states  went out of the Union, \"California would be with the South.\" Then, as a  convincing proof of his duplicity, he had these pro-rebel statements  stricken from the official report of his speech, that his constituents  might not take fright, and perhaps spoil some of the designs which he  and his scheming colleagues had upon California. Of course these remarks  reached the ears of his constituents anyhow, and though prefaced by a  studied evasiveness on his part, they contributed much to the feeling of  unrest and insecurity that then prevailed along the Coast.    It is of course a well-known fact that California never did secede, and  that soon after the war began, she swung definitely and conclusively  into the Union column. The danger of secession was wholly potential. Yet  potential dangers are none the less real. Had it not been for the  determined energies of a few loyalists in California, led by General E.  A. Sumner and cooperating with the Federal Government by means of the  swiftest communication then possible--the Pony Express--history today,  might read differently.    Now to turn once more to the potential dangers[18] that made the  California crisis a reality. About three-eighths of the population were  of southern descent and solidly united in sympathy for the Confederate  states. This vigorous minority included upwards of sixteen thousand  Knights of the Golden Circle, a pro-Confederate secret organization that  was active and dangerous in all the doubtful states in winning over to  the southern cause those who feebly protested loyalty to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#7)"],[1,"singular power over her--that is, so far as to  really interest her beyond even a degree that she was willing to exhibit  before him. What and why this was so must more clearly appear in the  course of the story as it progresses.    Mrs. Huntington was a lady of polished manner and cultivated intellect,  belonging to what might be termed the old school of English gentlewomen.  She had reared her only child with jealous care and assiduous attention,  so that her mind had been richly stored in classic lore, and her hands  duly instructed in domestic duties. There was no mock-modesty about the  mother, she was straightforward and literal in all she said or did;  evidently of excellent family, she was sufficiently assured of her  position not to be sensitive about its recognition by others, and  preferred to instil into her daughter's mind sound wholesome principles  to useless and giddy accomplishments. And yet the daughter was  accomplished, an excellent musician upon the piano and harp, and a  vocalist of rare sweetness and perfection of execution, as well as  mistress of other usual studies of her sex.    But the idea we would convey is, that the mother had rather endeavored  to fill her child's mind with real information and knowledge, than to  teach her that the chief end and aim of life were to learn how to  captivate a husband; she preferred to make her daughter a true and  noble-hearted woman, possessed of intrinsic excellence, rather than to  make her marketable for matrimonial sale; to give her something that  would prove to her under any and all circumstances, a reliance viz.,  sound principles and an excellent education.    \"Mother, how long before we shall turn our face towards England?\" said  the daughter, soon after the scene which we have described of the  sailing ship and her commander.    \"Within the month I hope, my child. I have already directed the  solicitor to close up all his business relative to your father's estate,  and the next homeward-bound ship may bear us in it.\"    \"I shall feel sad to leave our peaceful home here, mother, for, save my  dear father's death, has been very pleasant, very happy to be here.\"    \"There are many dear associations that must ever hang about its memory,  my dear; but after all, we shall be returning to our native land, and  that is a sweet thought. It is some twelve years since we lost sight of  English soil.\"    \"I remember it most vividly,\" said the child, recalling the past; \"ay,  as though it were but yesterday!\"    That night, as she lay sleeping in her daintily-furnished apartment,  into which the soft night-air was admitted through sweet geranium and  mignonette, which bloomed and shed their perfume with rare sweetness,  she dreamed of her native land, of him who had that day left her so  disappointed, of her childhood, and all its happy memories, and of much  that we will not refer to lest we anticipate our story.          CHAPTER VI.    THE WRECK.      ABOUT a fortnight subsequent to the period of the last chapter, Mrs.  Huntington and her daughter, with a single attendant found themselves  embarked on board the Bengal, a large, well-found Indiaman, bound for  Liverpool. The ship belonged to the East India Company, was a good  carrier, but calculated more for freight than speed. She was a new ship  and strong as iron and wood could be put together, and the widow and her  child found their quarters on board of an exceedingly comfortable  nature. They were the only passengers on board, but the vessel had a  heavy freight list, and as she moved out from her anchorage to lay her  course to sea, her draft of water was very deep.    The Bengal fortunately encountered none but the most favorable winds and  tides for many a long and to those on board somewhat monotonous days,  and the sun rose out of the sea clear and bright, and sunk again beneath  its surface in gorgeous splendor with every diurnal rotation, until at  length the ship touched at the Cape of Good Hope, where, having taken  fresh water and provisions on board, she cleared direct for Liverpool.  Every hour now seemed more especially to draw the ship nearer her port  of destination, and a fresh spirit was infused among passengers and  crew, in cabin and forecastle; but it was a long distance yet, and the  widow and her daughter found time for much study and reading, for which  they were amply supplied, and thus the time was lightened in its  progress and also well improved.    But the ocean is a treacherous element, and the fair weather which had  so long characterized their voyage, was to be varied now by fierce and  angry gales. It was the season of the year when they might expect this,  and the captain had kept a sharp lookout. It was the middle of a fine  afternoon that there was observed a singular phenomenon in the wind  which appeared to come from half a dozen points at the same moment. The  ship of course lost her steerage way, and the sea began most singularly  to get up from all points in heavy cross waves. It was evident that they  were either in the course of a whirlwind or close to its track, and  every now and then gusts came first larboard then starboard, and again  bows on and stern on, with a force that snapped the rigging like pipe  stems, and tore the canvass from the bolt ropes, notwithstanding the  prompt orders and nimble efforts of the seamen, before it could be  secured. Half an hour of this strange weather nearly stripped the ship  of her standing rigging, leaving her comparatively a helpless wreck upon  the waters, a mere log at the mercy of the wind and waves.    The worst had not yet come, however, for the ship was sound still in her  hull, and save that she was now wallowing in the trough of the sea, she  was comparatively safe; she had sprung no leak, but her heavy freight  tested her powers fearfully, and the captain was fain to acknowledge  that there was nought to be done but abide the raging of the storm until  it was over. His attempt to rig a jury mast, on which to bend sail  enough to give the ship steerage way, was perfectly fruitless; she  rolled and pitched so fearfully that no effort of the kind could  succeed, but the crew were kept busy throwing over the heavier at tiles  of freight to case the ship.    As right came on with its intense darkness relieved only by now and then  a terrible flash of liquid fire, all on board expected each moment might  be their last. Prayers were said, and all tried to compose their minds  as far as possible to meet that death which seemed to be fast  approaching them, when suddenly the cry ran, fore and aft that the  captain was lost overboard! This added to the general gloom; and now a  cry was heard \"there goes the Flying Dutchman,\" as was seen by several  on board the Indiaman, during the interval of the vivid lightning, a  large ship dash by them almost within cable's length, with a single  topsail close reefed running before the gale with the speed of the wind.  It did indeed look like a phantom craft. All was snug on board, not a  soul was in sight, everything battened down, save one dark form  apparently lashed to the wheel stanchions and steadily bent upon keeping  the ship before the storm; it was a sight that added to the terror of  those on board the Indiaman, and its effect was at once visible.    The ignorant and superstitious seamen, ever ready to argue evil from any  strange occurrence, now felt assured of their destruction, declaring  that the strange appearance of the phantom-ship was but a warning to  foretell the fate that was preparing for them. Thus actuated, all  discipline was gone, and no connected efforts were further made to  protect the ship or render her in any degree safer from the power of the  storm. To add still more to the critical condition on board, the ship  after straining and laboring so long, now began to leak and rapidly to  fill. In this desperate state of affairs several of the crew, whose  numbers were already thinned by being washed overboard, got into the  spirit room and in a condition of wild desperation became beastly  intoxicated, resolving to die insensible to danger! and at intervals  their crazy oaths and incoherent songs were heard above the gale.    At this crisis, as is generally the case, two or three sterling spirits  among the crew (and there is never a ship's company without some such  among its members), one, the second mate, and a couple of foremast  hands, came into the cabin and assured the widow and her daughter that  they would protect them to the last, and that they were even now  preparing the long boat with compass, water and food, so that should the  storm abate and the sea become less agitated before the ship should fill  and go down, they might launch it, and with the ladies and such of them  as desired, attempt to save themselves in this frail bark. With  heartfelt gratitude the mother and child accepted their protection and  awaited the crisis; but not without solemnly kneeling together upon the  cabin floor and committing themselves to the care of Divine Providence.    The second mate of the Bengal was the only officer left, but he was a  good sailor, a man of cool nerve and great personal strength. He now  went calmly to work, sounded the well and found four feet of water in  the ship, made his calculations how long it would require for the ship  to fill at the rate she then made water, and then set to work with his  two companions to rig a triangle with spars above the long boat, so as  to lift and launch it just when the proper moment should arrive, but  this he found to be impracticable. As the morning broke in the cast the  gale subsided, but the sea still kept up its angry commotion, though  that too, gradually subsided, the waves growing less and less, and the  ship becoming more and more quiet, enabling those on board to keep at  least upon their feet.    In the meantime, the ship had gradually settled so that the water was"]]]
