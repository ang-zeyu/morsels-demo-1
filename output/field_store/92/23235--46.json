If only I could set utterly and boundlessly free this hampered life of  mine, I would storm the four quarters and raise wave upon wave of tumult  all round; I would career away madly, like a wild horse, for very joy of  my own speed! But I am a Bengali, not a Bedouin! I go on sitting in my  corner, and mope and worry and argue. I turn my mind now this way up, now  the other--as a fish is fried--and the boiling oil blisters first this  side, then that.    Let it pass. Since I cannot be thoroughly wild, it is but proper that I  should make an endeavour to be thoroughly civil. Why foment a quarrel  between the two?          SHELIDAH,    _16th June 1892._      The more one lives alone on the river or in the open country, the clearer  it becomes that nothing is more beautiful or great than to perform the  ordinary duties of one's daily life simply and naturally. From the grasses  in the field to the stars in the sky, each one is doing just that; and  there is such profound peace and surpassing beauty in nature because none  of these tries forcibly to transgress its limitations.    Yet what each one does is by no means of little moment. The grass has to  put forth all its energy to draw sustenance from the uttermost tips of its  rootlets simply to grow where it is as grass; it does not vainly strive to  become a banyan tree; and so the earth gains a lovely carpet of green.  And, indeed, what little of beauty and peace is to be found in the  societies of men is owing to the daily performance of small duties, not to  big doings and fine talk.    Perhaps because the whole of our life is not vividly present at each  moment, some imaginary hope may lure, some glowing picture of a future,  untrammelled with everyday burdens, may tempt us; but these are illusory.          SHELIDAH,    _2nd Asarh (June) 1892._      Yesterday, the first day of _Asarh_,[1] the enthronement of the rainy  season was celebrated with due pomp and circumstance. It was very hot the  whole day, but in the afternoon dense clouds rolled up in stupendous  masses.    [Footnote 1: June-July, the commencement of the rainy season.]    I thought to myself, this first day of the rains, I would rather risk  getting wet than remain confined in my dungeon of a cabin.    The year 1293 [1] will not come again in my life, and,  for the matter of that, how many more even of these first days  of _Asarh_ will come? My life would be sufficiently long could it  number thirty of these first days of _Asarh_ to which the poet of the  _Meghaduta_[2] has, for me at least, given special distinction.    [Footnote 1: Of the Bengal era.]    [Footnote 2: In the _Meghaduta_ (Cloud Messenger) of Kalidas a famous  description of the burst of the Monsoon begins with the words: _On the  first day of Asarh_.]    It sometimes strikes me how immensely fortunate I am that each day should  take its place in my life, either reddened with the rising and setting  sun, or refreshingly cool with deep, dark clouds, or blooming like a white  flower in the moonlight. What untold wealth!    A thousand years ago Kalidas welcomed that first day of _Asarh_; and  once in every year of my life that same day of _Asarh_ dawns in all  its glory--that self-same day of the poet of old Ujjain, which has brought  to countless men and women their joys of union, their pangs of separation.    Every year one such great, time-hallowed day drops out of my life; and the  time will come when this day of Kalidas, this day of the _Meghaduta_,  this eternal first day of the Rains in Hindustan, shall come no more for  me. When I realise this I feel I want to take a good look at nature, to  offer a conscious welcome to each day's sunrise, to say farewell to each  day's setting sun, as to an intimate friend.    What a grand festival, what a vast theatre of festivity! And we cannot  even fully respond to it, so far away do we live from the world! The light  of the stars travels millions of miles to reach the earth, but it cannot  reach our hearts--so many millions of miles further off are we!    The world into which I have tumbled is peopled with strange beings. They  are always busy erecting walls and rules round themselves, and how careful  they are with their curtains lest they should see! It is a wonder to me  they have not made drab covers for flowering plants and put up a canopy to  ward off the moon. If the next life is determined by the desires of this,  then I should be reborn from our enshrouded planet into some free and open  realm of joy.    Only those who cannot steep themselves in beauty to the full, despise it  as an object of the senses. But those who have tasted of its  inexpressibility know how far it is beyond the highest powers of mere eye  or ear--nay, even the heart is powerless to attain the end of its  yearning.    _P.S._--I have left out the very thing I started to tell of. Don't be  afraid, it won't take four more sheets. It is this, that on the evening of  the first day of _Asarh_ it came on to rain very heavily, in great  lance-like showers. That is all.          ON THE WAY TO GOALUNDA,    _21st June 1892._      Pictures in an endless variety, of sand-banks, fields and their crops, and  villages, glide into view on either hand--of clouds floating in the sky,  of colours blossoming when day meets night. Boats steal by, fishermen  catch fish; the waters make liquid, caressing sounds throughout the  livelong day; their broad expanse calms down in the evening stillness,  like a child lulled to sleep, over whom all the stars in the boundless sky  keep watch--then, as I sit up on wakeful nights, with sleeping banks on  either side, the silence is broken only by an occasional cry of a jackal  in the woods near some village, or by fragments undermined by the keen  current of the Padma, that tumble from the high cliff-like bank into the  water.    Not that the prospect is always of particular interest--a yellowish  sandbank, innocent of grass or tree, stretches away; an empty boat is tied  to its edge; the bluish water, of the same shade as the hazy sky, flows  past; yet I cannot tell how it moves me. I suspect that the old desires  and longings of my servant-ridden childhood--when in the solitary  imprisonment of my room I pored over the _Arabian Nights_, and shared  with Sinbad the Sailor his adventures in many a strange land--are not yet  dead within me, but are roused at the sight of any empty boat tied to a  sand-bank.    If I had not heard fairy tales and read the _Arabian Nights_ and  _Robinson Crusoe_ in childhood, I am sure views of distant banks, or  the farther side of wide fields, would not have stirred me so--the whole  world, in fact, would have had for me a different appeal.    What a maze of fancy and fact becomes tangled up within the mind of man!  The different strands--petty and great--of story and event and picture,  how they get knotted together!          SHELIDAH,    _22nd June 1892._      Early this morning, while still lying in bed, I heard the women at the  bathing-place sending forth joyous peals of _Ulu! Ulu!_[1] The sound  moved me curiously, though it is difficult to say why.    [Footnote 1: A peculiar shrill cheer given by women on auspicious or  festive occasions.]    Perhaps such joyful outbursts put one in mind of the great stream of  festive activity which goes on in this world, with most of which the  individual man has no connection. The world is so immense, the concourse  of men so vast, yet with how few has one any tie! Distant sounds of life,  wafted near, bearing tidings from unknown homes, make the individual  realise that the greater part of the world of men does not, cannot own or  know him; then he feels deserted, loosely attached to the world, and a  vague sadness creeps over him.    Thus these cries of _Ulu! Ulu!_ made my life, past and future, seem  like a long, long road, from the very ends of which they come to me. And  this feeling colours for me the beginning of my day.    As soon as the manager with his staff, and the ryots seeking audience,  come upon the scene, this faint vista of past and future will be promptly  elbowed out, and a very robust present will salute and stand before me.          SHAZADPUR,    _25th June 1892._      In to-day's letters there was a touch about A---'s singing which made my  heart yearn with a nameless longing. Each of the little joys of life,  which remain unappreciated amid the hubbub of the town, send in their  claims to the heart when far from home. I love music, and there is no  dearth of voices and instruments in Calcutta, yet I turn a deaf ear to  them. But, though I may fail to realise it at the time, this needs must  leave the heart athirst.    As I read to-day's letters, I felt such a poignant desire to hear A---'s  sweet song, I was at once sure that one of the many suppressed longings of  creation which cry after fulfilment is for neglected joys within reach;  while we are busy pursuing chimerical impossibilities we famish our  lives....    The emptiness left by easy joys, untasted, is ever growing in my life. And  the day may come when I shall feel that, could I but have the past back, I  would strive no more after the unattainable, but drain to the full these  little, unsought, everyday joys which life offers.          SHAZADPUR,    _27th June 1892._      Yesterday, in the afternoon, it clouded over so threateningly, I felt a  sense of dread. I do not remember ever to have seen before such  angry-looking clouds.    Swollen masses of the deepest indigo blue were piled, one on top of the  other, just above the horizon, looking like the puffed-out moustaches of  some raging demon.    Under the jagged lower edges of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#7)"],[1,"exigencies. Little more than two years prevailed the  supreme power of the Decemvirate, and the consular jurisdiction of the  military Tribunes not very many. The domination of Cinna was but short,  that of Sylla not long. The authority of Pompey and Crassus was quickly  swallowed up in Caesar; that of Lepidus and Anthony in Augustus. The  Commonwealth, then long distressed and exhausted by the rage of her  civil dissensions, fell easily into his hands, and over her he assumed  a sovereign dominion; yet softened with a venerable name, that of Prince  or Chief of the Senate. But the several revolutions in the ancient  free state of Rome, and all her happy or disastrous events, are already  recorded by writers of signal renown. Nor even in the reign of Augustus  were there wanting authors of distinction and genius to have composed  his story; till by the prevailing spirit of fear, flattery, and  abasement they were checked. As to the succeeding Princes, Tiberius,  Caligula, Claudius, and Nero; the dread of their tyranny, whilst they  yet reigned, falsified their history; and after their fall, the fresh  detestation of their cruelties inflamed their Historians. Hence my own  design of recounting briefly certain incidents in the reign of Augustus,  chiefly towards his latter end, and of entering afterwards more fully  into that of Tiberius and the other three; unbiassed as I am in this  undertaking by any resentment, or any affection; all the influences of  these personal passions being far from me.    When, after the fall of Brutus and Cassius, there remained none to fight  for the Commonwealth, and her arms were no longer in her own hands; when  Sextus Pompeius was utterly defeated in Sicily, Lepidus bereft of  his command. Marc Anthony slain; and of all the chiefs of the late  Dictator's party, only Octavius his nephew was left; he put off the  invidious name of Triumvir, and styling himself Consul, pretended that  the jurisdiction attached to the Tribuneship was his highest aim, as in  it the protection of the populace was his only view: but when once he  had laid his foundations wider, secured the soldiery by liberality and  donations, gained the people by store of provisions, and charmed all  by the blessings and sweetness of public peace, he began by politic  gradations to exalt himself, to extend his domination, and with his own  power to consolidate the authority of the Senate, jurisdiction of the  Magistrate, and weight and force of the Laws; usurpations in which he  was thwarted by no man: all the bravest Republicans and his most  daring foes were slain in battle, or gleaned up by the late sanguinary  proscriptions; and for the surviving Nobility, they were covered with  wealth, and distinguished with public honours, according to the measure  of their debasement, and promptness to bondage. Add, that all the  creatures of this new Power, who in the loss of public freedom had  gained private fortunes, preferred a servile condition, safe and  possessed, to the revival of ancient liberty with personal peril.  Neither were the Provinces averse to the present Revolution, and  Sovereignty of one; since under that of the people and Senate they had  lived in constant fear and mistrust, sorely rent and harassed as they  were by the raging competition amongst our Grandees, as well as by the  grievous rapine and exactions of our Magistrates; in vain too, under  these their oppressions, had been their appeal to the protection of the  laws, which were utterly enfeebled and borne down by might and violence,  by faction and parties; nay, even by subornation and money.    Moreover, Augustus, in order to fortify his domination with collateral  bulwarks, raised his sister's son Claudius Marcellus, a perfect youth,  to the dignity of Pontiff and that of Aedile; preferred Marcus Agrippa  to two successive Consulships, a man in truth meanly born but an  accomplished soldier, and the companion of his victories; and Marcellus,  the husband of Julia, soon after dying, chose him for his son-in-law.  Even the sons of his wife, Tiberius Nero, and Claudius Drusus, he  dignified with high military titles and commands; though his house  was yet supported by descendants of his own blood. For into the Julian  family and name of the Caesars he had already adopted Lucius and Caius,  the sons of Agrippa; and though they were but children, neither of them  seventeen years old, vehement had been his ambition to see them declared  Princes of the Roman Youth and even designed to the Consulship; while  openly, he was protesting against admitting these early honours.  Presently, upon the decease of Agrippa, were these his children snatched  away, either by their own natural but hasty fate, or by the deadly fraud  of their step-mother Livia; Lucius on his journey to command the armies  in Spain; Caius in his return from Armenia, ill of a wound: and as  Drusus, one of her own sons, had been long since dead, Tiberius remained  sole candidate for the succession. Upon this object, centred all  princely honours; he was by Augustus adopted for his son, assumed  Colleague in the Empire, partner in the jurisdiction tribunitial, and  presented under all these dignities to the several armies: instances  of grandeur which were no longer derived from the secret schemes  and plottings of his mother, as in times past, while her husband had  unexceptionable heirs of his own, but thenceforth bestowed at her open  suit. For as Augustus was now very aged, she had over him obtained  such absolute sway, that for her pleasure he banished into the Isle of  Planasia his only surviving grandson, Agrippa Postumus; one, in truth,  destitute of laudable accomplishments, in his temper untractable,  and stupidly conceited of his mighty strength, but branded with no  misdemeanour or transgression. The Emperor had withal set Germanicus,  the son of Drusus, over eight legions quartered upon the Rhine, and  obliged Tiberius to adopt him, though Tiberius had then a son of his  own, one of competent years; but it was the study of Augustus, to secure  himself and the succession by variety of stays and engraftments. War at  that time there was none, except that in Germany, kept on foot rather  to abolish the disgrace sustained by Quinctilius Varus, there slain with  his army, than from any ambition to enlarge the Empire, or for any other  valuable advantage. In profound tranquillity were affairs at Rome. To  the Magistrates remained their wonted names; of the Romans the younger  sort had been born since the battle of Actium, and even most of the old  during the civil wars: how few were then living who had seen the ancient  free State!    The frame and economy of Rome being thus totally overturned, amongst  the Romans were no longer found any traces of their primitive spirit,  or attachment to the virtuous institutions of antiquity. But as the  equality of the whole was extinguished by the sovereignty of one, all  men regarded the orders of the Prince as the only rule of conduct and  obedience; nor felt they any anxiety, while Augustus yet retained vigour  of life, and upheld the credit of his administration with public peace,  and the imperial fortune of his house. But when he became broken with  the pressure of age and infirmities; when his end was at hand, and  thence a new source of hopes and views was presented, some few there  were who began to reason idly about the blessings and recovery of  Liberty; many dreaded a civil war, others longed for one; while far the  greater part were uttering their several apprehensions of their future  masters; \"that naturally stern and savage was the temper of Agrippa,  and by his public contumely enraged into fury; and neither in age nor  experience was he equal to the weight of Empire. Tiberius indeed had  arrived at fulness of years, and was a distinguished captain, but  possessed the inveterate pride entailed upon the Claudian race; and many  indications of a cruel nature escaped him, in spite of all his arts to  disguise it; besides that from his early infancy he was trained up in a  reigning house, and even in his youth inured to an accumulation of power  and honours, consulships and triumphs: nor during the several years of  his abode at Rhodes, where, under the plausible name of retirement, a  real banishment was covered, did he exercise other occupation than that  of meditating future vengeance, studying the arts of treachery, and  practising secret, abominable sensualities: add to these considerations,  that of his mother, a woman inspired with all the tyranny of her  sex; yes, the Romans must be under bondage to a woman, and moreover  enthralled by two youths, who would first combine to oppress the State,  and then falling into dissension, rend it piecemeal.\"    While the public was engaged in these and the like debates, the illness  of Augustus waxed daily more grievous; and some strongly suspected the  pestilent practices of his wife. For there had been, some months before,  a rumour abroad, that Augustus having singled out a few of his most  faithful servants, and taken Fabius Maximus for his only companion, had,  with no other retinue, sailed secretly over to the Island of Planasia,  there to visit his Grandson Agrippa; that many tears were shed on both  sides, many tokens of mutual tenderness shown, and hopes from thence  conceived, that the unhappy youth would be restored to his own place in  his Grandfather's family. That Maximus had disclosed it to Martia, she  to Livia; and thence the Emperor knew that the secret was betrayed: that  Maximus being soon after dead (dead, as it was doubted, through fear, by  his own hands), Martia was observed, in her lamentations and groans  at his funeral, to accuse herself as the sad cause of her husband's  destruction. Whatever truth was in all this, Tiberius was scarce entered  Illyrium, but he was hastily recalled by his mother's letters: nor is  it fully known whether at his"]]]
