This being equivalent to  \"asking for more,\" it drove me to the limits of my patience. It  was evidently now necessary to assume wrath, and to raise my  voice to a roar.    \"My hands dey be empty! I see nuffin, I hear nuffin! What for I  make more dash?\"    Allow me, parenthetically, to observe that the African, like the  Scotch Highlander, will interpose the personal or demonstrative  pronoun between noun and verb: \"sun he go down,\" means \"the sun  sets\" and, as genders do not exist, you must be careful to say,  \"This woman he cry too much.\"    The justice of my remark was owned by all; had it been the height  of tyranny, the supple knaves would have agreed with me quite as  politely. They only replied that \"Young Prince,\" being a man of  years and dignity, would be dishonoured by dismissal empty-  handed, and they represented him as my future host when we moved  nearer the bush.    \"Now lookee here. This he be bad plábbá (palaver). This he be  bob! I come up for white man, you come up for black man. All  white man he no be fool, 'cos he no got black face!\"    Ensued a chorus of complimentary palaver touching the infinite  superiority of the Aryan over the Semite, but the point was in no  wise yielded. At last Young Prince subsided into a request for a  glass of rum, which being given \"cut the palaver\" (i.e. ended the  business). I soon resolved to show my hosts, by threatening to  leave them, the difference between traders and travellers. Barbot  relates that the Mpongwe of olden time demanded his \"dassy\"  before he consented to \"liquor up,\" and boldly asked, \"If he was  expected to drink gratis?\" The impertinence was humoured,  otherwise not an ivory would have found its way to the factory.  But the traveller is not bound to endure these whimsy-whamsies;  and the sooner he declares his independence the better. Many  monkeys' skins were brought to me for sale, but I refused to buy,  lest the people might think it my object to make money; moreover,  all were spoilt for specimens by the \"points\" being snipped off.    I happened during the first afternoon to show my hosts a picture  of the bald-headed chimpanzee, Nchígo Mbúwwe (Troglodytes  calvus), here more generally called Nchígo Mpolo, \"large  chimpanzee,\" or Nchígo Njúe, \"white-haired chimpanzee.\" They  recognized it at once; but when I turned over to the cottage  (\"Adventures,\" &c., p. 423), with its neat parachute-like roof,  all burst out laughing.    \"You want to look him Nágo (house)?\" asked Hotaloya.    \"Yes, for sure,\" I replied.    Forteune set out at once, carrying my gun, Selim followed me, and  the rear was brought up by a couple of little prick-eared curs  with a dash of the pointer, probably from St. Helena: the people  will pay as much as ten dollars for a good dog. They are never  used in hunting apes, as they start the game; on this occasion  they nearly ran down a small antelope.    The path led through a new clearing; a field of fern and some  patches of grass breaking the forest, which, almost clear of  thicket and undergrowth, was a charming place for deer. The soil,  thin sand overlying humus, suggested rich crops of ground-nuts;  its surface was everywhere cut by nullahs, now dry, and by  brooks, running crystal streams; these, when deep, are crossed by  tree-trunks, the Brazilian \"pingela.\" After twenty minutes or so  we left the \"picada\" (foot-path) and struck into a thin bush,  till we had walked about a mile.    \"Look him house, Nchígo house!\" said Hotaloya, standing under a  tall tree.    I saw to my surprise two heaps of dry sticks, which a schoolboy  might have taken for birds' nests; the rude beds, boughs, torn  off from the tree, not gathered, were built in forks, one ten and  the other twenty feet above ground, and both were canopied by the  tufted tops. Every hunter consulted upon the subject ridiculed  the branchy roof tied with vines, and declared that the Nchigo's  industry is confined to a place for sitting, not for shelter;  that he fashions no other dwelling; that a couple generally  occupies the same or some neighbouring tree, each sitting upon  its own nest; that the Nchígo is not a \"hermit\" nor a rare, nor  even a very timid animal; that it dwells, as I saw, near  villages, and that its cry, \"Aoo! Aoo! Aoo!\" is often heard by  them in the mornings and evenings. During my subsequent  wanderings in Gorilla land, I often observed tall and mushroom-  shaped trees standing singly, and wearing the semblance of the  umbrella roof. What most puzzles me is, that M. du Chaillu  (\"Second Expedition,\" chap, iii.) \"had two of the bowers cut down  and sent to the British Museum.\" He adds, \"They are formed at a  height of twenty to thirty feet in the trees, by the animals  bending over and intertwining a number of the weaker boughs, so  as to form bowers, under which they can sit, protected from the  rains by the masses of foliage thus entangled together, some of  the boughs being so bent that they form convenient seats.\" Surely  M. du Chaillu must have been deceived by some vagary of nature.    The gorilla-hunter's sketch had always reminded me of the Rev.  Mr. Moffat's account of the Hylobian Bakones, the aborigines of  the Matabele country. Mr. Thompson, a missionary to Sherbro (\"The  Palm Land,\" chap. xiii), has, however, these words:--\"It is said  of the chimpanzees, that they build a kind of rude house of  sticks in their wild state, and fill it with leaves; and I doubt  it not, for when domesticated they always want some good bed, and  make it up regularly.\"    Thus I come to the conclusion that the Nchígo Mpolo is a vulgar  nest-building ape. The bushmen and the villagers all assured me  that neither the common chimpanzee, nor the gorilla proper  (Troglodytes gorilla), \"make 'im house.\" On the other hand, Mr.  W. Winwood Reade, writing to \"The Athenæum\" from Loanda (Sept. 7,  1862), asserts,--\"When the female is pregnant he (the gorilla)  builds a nest (as do also the Kulu-Kamba and the chimpanzee),  where she is delivered, and which is then abandoned.\" And he thus  confirms what was told to Dr. Thomas Savage (1847): \"In the wild  state their (i.e. the gorillas') habits are in general like those  of the Troglodytes niger, building their nests loosely in trees.\"                                      Chapter III.                        Geography of the Gaboon.        Before going further afield I may be allowed a few observations,  topographical and ethnological, about this highly interesting  section of the West African coast.    The Gaboon country, to retain the now familiar term, although no  one knows much about its derivation, is placed, by old travellers  in \"South Guinea,\" the tract lying along the Ethiopic, or South  Atlantic Ocean, limited by the Camarones Mountain-block in north  latitude 4°, and by Cabo Negro in south latitude 15° 40' 7\", a  sea-line of nearly 1,200 miles. The Gaboon proper is included  between the Camarones Mountains to the north, and the  \"Mayumba,\"properly the \"Yumba\" country southwards, in south  latitude 3° 22',--a shore upwards of 400 miles long. The inland  depth is undetermined; geographically we should limit it to the  Western Ghats, which rarely recede more than 60 miles from the  sea, and ethnologically no line can yet be drawn. The country is  almost bisected by the equator, and by the Rio de Gabão, which  discharges in north latitude 0° 21' 25\" and east longitude 9° 21'  23\"; and it corresponds in parallel with the Somali-Galla country  and the Juba River on the east coast.    The general aspect of the region is prepossessing. It is a  rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by  hills and dwarf chains, either detached or pushed out by the  Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot,  like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central  African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the  main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich  vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns,  produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area  actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush.  In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are  beautiful tracts of clear grassy land, and the woods, clear of  undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a tropical  jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) in  the interior of North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po,  thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare,  sufficing only for home use. The southern parts, about Cape Lopez  and beyond it, resemble the Oil River country in the Biafran  Bight: the land is a mass of mangrove swamps, and the climate is  unfit for white men.    The Eastern Ghats were early known to the \"Iberians,\" as shown by  the Sierra del Crystal, del Sal, del Sal Nitro and other names,  probably so called from the abundance of quartz in blocks and  veins that seam the granite, as we shall see in the Congo  country, and possibly because they contain rock crystal. Although  in many places they may be descried subtending the shore in lumpy  lines like detached vertebræ, and are supposed to represent the  Aranga Mons of Ptolemy, they are not noticed by Barbot. Between  the Camarones River and Cape St. John (Corisco Bay), blue,  rounded, and discontinuous masses, apparently wooded, rise before  the mariner, and form, as will be seen, the western sub-ranges of  the great basin-rim. To the north they probably anastomose with  the Camarones, the Rumbi, the Kwa, the Fumbina north-east, and  the Niger-Kong mountains.[FN#5]    They are not wanting who declare them to be rich in precious  metals. Some thirty years ago an American super-cargo ascended  the Rembwe River, the south-eastern line of the Gaboon fork, and  is said to have collected \"dirt\" which, tested"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#7)"],[1," the climate proved deadly to white  men. The 24 sappers and 60 linesmen extracted nearly 4,000 lbs.  of gangue per diem, when the English manager and his assistant,  with four of the ten miners died, and the plant was destroyed by  fire. I was assured that this line (Ambriz-Bembe) was an easy  adit to the interior, and so far the information is confirmed by  the late Livingstone-Congo Expedition under Lieutenant Grandy.    In 1863 the coast was still in confusion. The Portuguese claimed  too much seaboard according to the British: the British  government ignored the just claims of Portugal, and the political  bickerings were duly embittered by a demoralized race of English  traders, who perpetually applied for cruisers, complaining that  the troops interfered with their trade. Even in the seventeenth  century the Portuguese had asserted their rights to the Reino do  Congo, extending between the great stream of that name and the  Ambriz, also called the Loge and Doce River. In the older maps--  for instance, Lopes de Lima--the Loge is an independent stream  placed north of the Ambriz River; in fact, it represents the Rue  or Lue River of Kinsembo, which is unknown to our charts. Within  the Doce and the Cuanza lies the Reino de Angola, of which, they  say, the Congo was a dependency, and south of the Cuanza begins  the Reino de Benguela. The Government-General of Loanda thus  contained four provinces-Congo (now reduced to Ambriz), Angola,  Benguela, and Mossamedes. The English government has now agreed  to recognize the left or southern bank of the Ambriz as the  northern frontier of Angola and of Portuguese rule.    Passing the river mouth, we were alongside of independent lands,  and new to us. Boobies (Pelecanus sula), gulls, petrels, and men-  of-war birds (P. aquila), flew about the ship; according to the  experts, they were bound for fetid marshes which outlie the Loge  River. Before nightfall we were off the Lue or Rue River of  Kinsembo, which disputes with Landána (not \"Landano\"[FN#4]) the  palm of bad landing. At this season boats are    052--- sometimes kept waiting fourteen days, and the \"barreiras\"  (cliffs) are everywhere at unbounded war with the waters. I  determined to land and to inspect the \"remarkable lofty granite  pillar,\" which was dimly visible from our deck; but we rowed in  vain along the tall and rusty sea-walls. No whaler could attack  the huge rollers that raised their monstrous backs, plunged over  with a furious roar, and bespread the beach with a swirl of foam.  At last, seeing a fine surf-boat, artistically raised at stern  and bow, and manned by Cabindas, the Kruboys of the coast, made  fast to a ship belonging to Messrs. Tobin of Liverpool, we  boarded it, and obtained a passage.    The negroes showed their usual art. Paddling westward they  rounded the high red and white South Point, where a projecting  reef broke the rollers. We waited for some twenty minutes for a  lull; at the auspicious moment every throat was strained by a  screaming shout, and the black backs bent doughtily to their  work. We were raised like infants in the nurse's arms; the good  craft was flung forward with the seething mass, and as she  touched shore we sprang out, whilst our conveyance was beached by  a crowd of stragglers. The dreaded bar is as usual double: in the  heaviest weather boats make for a solitary palm-tree at the  bottom of the sandy bay. Some of the dug-outs are in pairs like  the Brazilian Ajoujo; the sides are lashed together or fastened  by thwarts, and both are made to bend a little too much inwards.    It was dark when we climbed up the stiff Jacob's ladder along the  landward side of the white Kinsembo bluff. There are three ramps:  the outermost is fit only for unshod feet; the central is better  for those who can squeeze through the rocky crevices, and the  furthest is tolerably easy; but it can be reached only by  canoeing across the stream. Mr. Hunter of Messrs. Tobin's house  received us in the usual factory of the South Coast, a ground-  floor of wicker-work, windowless, and thatched after native  fashion. The chief agent, who shall be nameless, was drunk arid  disorderly: it is astonishing that men of business can trust  their money to such irresponsible beings; he had come out to  Blackland a teetotaller, and presently his condition became a  living lecture upon geographical morality.    The night gave us a fine study of the Kinsembo mosquito, a large  brown dipter, celebrated even upon this coast. A barrel of water  will act as nursery; at times the plagues are said to extinguish  a lantern, and to lie an inch deep at the bottom. I would back  them against a man's life after two nights of full exposure: the  Brazilian \"Marimbondo\" is not worse. At 7 A.M. on the next day we  descended the easiest of the ramps, which are common upon this  coast, and were paddled over the Kinsembo River. Eleven miles  off, it issues from masses of high ground, and at this season it  spreads out like the Ambriz in broad stagnant sheets, bordered  with reeds and grass supplying fish and crabs, wild ducks and  mosquitoes. Presently, when the Cacimbo ends in stormy rains and  horrid rollers, its increased volume and impetus will burst the  sand-strip which confines it, and the washed-away material will  recruit the terrible bar.    Leaving the ferry, wre mounted the \"tipoias,\" which Englishmen  call \"hammocks\" after the Caribs of Jamaica, and I found a  strange contrast between the men of Kinsembo and of São Paulo.  The former are admirable bearers, like their brethren of  Ambrizette, famed as the cream of the coast: four of them carried  us at the rate of at least six miles an hour; apparently they  cannot go slowly, and they are untireable as black ants. Like the  Bahian cadeira-men, they use shoulder-pads, and forked sticks to  act as levers when shifting; the bamboo-pole has ivory pegs, to  prevent the hammock-clews slipping, and the sensation is somewhat  that of being tossed in a blanket.    Quitting the creeper-bound sand, we crossed a black and fetid  mire, and struck inland to a higher and drier level. The  vegetation was that of the Calumbo road, but not so utterly  sunburnt: there were dwarf fields of Manioc and Thur (Cajanus  indicus), and the large wild cotton shrubs showed balls of  shortish fibre. As we passed a euphorbia-hedged settlement,  Kizúlí yá Mú, \"Seabeach Village,\" a troop of women and girls,  noisy as those of Ugogo, charged us at full gallop: a few silver  bits caused prodigious excitement in the liberal display of  charms agitated by hard exercise. The men were far less  intrusive, they are said not to be jealous of European rivals,  but madly so amongst themselves: even on suspicion of injury, the  husband may kill his wife and her lover.    At Kilwanika, the next hamlet, there was a \"king;\" and it would  not have been decent to pass the palace unvisited. Outside the  huts stood a bamboo-girt \"compound,\" which we visited whilst H.M.  was making his toilette, and where, contrary to Congo usage, the  women entered with us. Twenty-two boys aged nine or ten showed,  by faces whitened with ashes, that they had undergone  circumcision, a ceremony which lasts three months: we shall find  these Jinkimba in a far wilder state up the Congo. The rival  house is the Casa das Tinta, where nubile girls are decorated by  the Nganga, or medicine-man, with a greasy crimson-purple pigment  and, preparatory to entering the holy state of matrimony, receive  an exhaustive lecture upon its physical phases. Father Merolla  tells us that the Congoese girls are locked up in pairs for two  or three months out of the sight of man, bathing several times a  day, and applying \"taculla,\" the moistened dust of a red wood;  without this \"casket of water\" or \"of fire,\" as they call it,  barrenness would be their lot. After betrothal the bride was  painted red by the \"man-witch\" for one month, to declare her  engagement, and the mask was washed off before nuptials. Hence  the \"Paint House\" was a very abomination to the good Fathers.  Amongst the Timni tribe, near Sierra Leone, the Semo, or  initiation for girls, begins with a great dance, called Colungee  (Kolangí), and the bride is \"instructed formally in such  circumstances as most immediately concern women.\"    After halting for half an hour, ringed by a fence of blacks, we  were summoned to the presence, where we found a small boy backed  by a semi-circle of elders, and adorned with an old livery coat,  made for a full-grown \"Jeames.\" With immense dignity, and without  deigning to look at us, he extended a small black paw like a  Chimpanzee's, and received in return a promise of rum--the sole  cause of our detention. And, as we departed through the euphorbia  avenue, we were followed by the fastest trotters, the Flora  Temples and the Ethan Allens, of the village.    Beyond Kilwanika the land became rougher and drier, whilst the  swamps between the ground-waves were deeper and stickier, the  higher ridges bearing natural Stonehenges, of African, not  English, proportions At last we dismounted, ascended a rise, the  most northerly of these \"Aravat Hills,\" and stood at the base of  the \"Lumba\" The Pillar of Kmsembo is composed of two huge blocks,  not basaltic, but of coarse-grained reddish granite the base  measures twenty and the shaft forty feet high. With a little  trimming it might be converted into a superior Pompey's Pillar:  we shall see many of these monoliths in different parts of the  Congo country.    The heat of the day was passed in the shade of the Lumba,  enjoying the sea-breeze and the novel view. It was debated  whether we should return viâ Masera, a well-known slaving  village, whose barracoons were still standing. But the bearers  dissuaded us, declaring that they might be seized as \"dash,\"  unless the white men paid heavy \"comey\" like those who shipped  black cargoes: they cannot shake off this old practice of  claiming"]]]
