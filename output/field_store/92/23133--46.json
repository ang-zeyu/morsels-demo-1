And all were resolved to bring  their treasures, rings, and jewels, and their best and richest  and most beautiful household stuffs, and burn them to ashes in  the great square, lest the enemy should take them and make  trophies of them. Also there were men charged to set fire to all  the stores and burn them, and to stave in all the wine-casks;  others to set fire to every single house, to burn the enemy and  us together. The citizens thus were all of one mind, rather than  see the bloody knife at their throats, and their wives and  daughters ravished and taken by the cruel savage Spaniards.    Now we had certain prisoners, who had been made secretly to  understand our last determination and desperation; these  prisoners M. de Guise sent away on parole, who being come to  their camp, lost no time in saying what we had told them; which  restrained the great and vehement desire of the enemy, so that  they were no longer eager to enter the town to cut our throats  and enrich themselves with the spoils. The Emperor, having heard  the decision of this great warrior, M. de Guise, put water in his  wine, and restrained his fury; saying that he could not enter the  town save with vast butchery and carnage, and shedding of much  blood, both of those defending and of those attacking, and they  would be all dead together, and in the end he would get nothing  but ashes; and afterward men might say it was a like destruction  to that of the town of Jerusalem, made of old time by Titus and  Vespasian.    The Emperor thus having heard our last resolve, and seeing how  little he had gained by his attack, sappings, and mines, and the  great plague that was through all his camp, and the adverse time  of the year, and the want of victuals and of money, and how his  soldiers were disbanding themselves and going off in great  companies, decided at last to raise the siege and go away, with  the cavalry of his vanguard, and the greater part of the  artillery and engines of war. The Marquis of Brandebourg was the  last to budge from his place; he had with him some troops of  Spaniards and Bohemians, and his German regiments, and there he  stopped for a day and a half, to the great regret of M. de Guise,  who brought four pieces of artillery out of the town, which he  fired on him this side and that, to hurry him off: and off he  went, sure enough, and all his men with him.    When he was a quarter of a league from Metz, he was seized with a  panic lest our cavalry should fall upon his tail; so he set fire  to his store of powder, and left behind him some pieces of  artillery, and a quantity of baggage, which he could not take  along with him, because their vanguard and their great cannons  had broken and torn tip the roads. Our cavalry were longing with  all their hearts to issue from the town and attack him behind;  but M. de Guise never let them, saying on the contrary we had  better make their way smooth for them, and build them gold and  silver bridges to let them go; like the good pastor and shepherd,  who will not lose one of his sheep.    That is how our dear and well-beloved Imperials went away from  Metz, which was the day after Christmas Day, to the great content  of those within the walls, and the praise of the princes,  seigneurs, captains, and soldiers, who had endured the travail of  this siege for more than two months. Nevertheless, they did not  all go: there wanted more than twenty thousand of them, who were  dead, from our artillery and the fighting, or from plague, cold,  and starvation (and from spite and rage that they could not get  into the town to cut our throats and plunder us): and many of  their horses also died, the greater part whereof they had eaten  instead of beef and bacon. We went where their camp had been,  where we found many dead bodies not yet buried, and the earth all  worked up, as one sees in the Cemetery of the Holy Innocents  during some time of many deaths. In their tents, pavilions, and  lodgings were many sick people. Also cannon-shot, weapons, carts,  waggons, and other baggage, with a great quantity of soldier's  bread, spoiled and rotted by the snows and rains (yet the  soldiers had it but by weight and measure). Also they left a good  store of wood, all that remained of the houses they had  demolished and broken down in the villages for two or three  leagues around; also many other pleasure-houses, that had  belonged to our citizens, with gardens and fine orchards full of  diverse fruit-trees. And without all this, they would have been  benumbed and dead of the cold, and forced to raise the siege  sooner than they did.    M. de Guise had their dead buried, and their sick people treated.  Also the enemy left behind them in the Abbey of Saint Arnoul many  of their wounded soldiers, whom they could not possibly take with  them. M. de Guise sent them all victuals enough, and ordered me  and the other surgeons to go dress and physick them, which we did  with good will; and I think they would not have done the like for  our men. For the Spaniard is very cruel, treacherous, and  inhuman, and so far enemy of all nations: which is proved by  Lopez the Spaniard, and Benzo of Milan, and others who have  written the history of America and the West Indies: who have had  to confess that the cruelty, avarice, blasphemies, and wickedness  of the Spaniards have utterly estranged the poor Indians from the  religion that these Spaniards professed. And all write that they  are of less worth than the idolatrous Indians, for their cruel  treatment of these Indians.    And some days later M. de Guise sent a trumpet to Thionville to  the enemy, that they could send for their wounded in safety:  which they did with carts and waggons, but not enough. M. de  Guise gave them carts and carters, to help to take them to  Thionville. Our carters, when they returned, told us the roads  were all paved with dead bodies, and they never got half the men  there, for they died in their carts: and the Spaniards seeing  them at the point of death, before they had breathed their last,  threw them out of the carts and buried them in the mud and mire,  saying they had no orders to bring back dead men. Moreover, our  carters said they had found on the roads many carts stuck in the  mud, full of baggage, for which the enemy dared not send back,  lest we who were within Metz should run out upon them.    I would return to the reason why so many of them died; which was  mostly starvation, the plague, and cold. For the snow was more  than two feet deep upon the ground, and they were lodged in pits  below the ground, covered only with a little thatch.  Nevertheless, each soldier had his camp-bed, and a coverlet all  strewed with stars, glittering and shining brighter than fine  gold, and every day they had white sheets, and lodged at the sign  of the Moon, and enjoyed themselves if only they had been able,  and paid their host so well over night that in the morning they  went off quits, shaking their ears; and they had no need of a  comb to get the down and feathers out of their beards and hair,  and they always found a white table-cloth, and would have enjoyed  good meals but for want of food. Also the greater part of them  had neither boots, half-boots, slippers, hose, nor shoes: and  most of them would rather have none than any, because they were  always in the mire up to mid-leg. And because they went bare-  foot, we called them the Emperor's Apostles.    After the camp was wholly dispersed, I distributed my patients  into the hands of the surgeons of the town, to finish dressing  them: then I took leave of M. de Guise, and returned to the King,  who received me with great favour, and asked me how I had been  able to make my way into Metz. I told him fully all that I had  done. He gave me two hundred crowns, and an hundred which I had  when I set out: and said he would never leave me poor. Then I  thanked him very humbly for the good and the honour he was  pleased to do me.          THE JOURNEY TO HESDIN. 1553      The Emperor Charles laid siege to the town of Therouenne; and M.  le Due de Savoie was General of his whole army. It was taken by  assault: and there was a great number of our men killed and taken  prisoners.    The King, wishing to prevent the enemy from besieging the town  and castle of Hesdin also, sent thither MM. le Duc de Bouillon,  le Duc Horace, le Marquis de Villars, and a number of captains,  and about eighteen hundred soldiers: and during the siege of  Therouenne, these Seigneurs fortified the castle of Hesdin, so  that it seemed to be impregnable. The King sent me to the  Seigneurs, to help them with my art, if they should come to have  need of it.    Soon after the capture of Therouenne, we were besieged in Hesdin.  There was a clear stream of running water within shot of our  cannon, and about it were fourscore or an hundred of the enemy's  rabble, drawing water. I was on a rampart watching the enemy  pitch their camp; and, seeing the crowd of idlers round the  stream, I asked M. du Pont, commissary of the artillery, to send  one cannon-shot among this canaille: he gave me a flat refusal,  saying that all this sort of people was not worth the powder  would be wasted on them. Again I begged him to level the cannon,  telling him, \"The more dead, the fewer enemies;\" which he did for  my sake: and the shot killed fifteen or sixteen, and wounded  many. Our men made sorties against the enemy, wherein many were  killed and wounded on both sides, with gunshot or with fighting  hand to hand; and our men often sallied out before their trenches  were made; so that I had my work cut out for me, and had no rest  either day or night for dressing the wounded.    And here I would note that we had put many of them in a great  tower, laying them on a little straw: and their pillows were  stones, their coverlets were cloaks, those who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#7)"],[1,"sarcophagus had been opened in some way!    Now, to the watcher's unbounded astonishment, Ah Fu placed the birdcage  in the opening, and apparently reclosed the trap in the end of the  coffin. He made other manipulations with his bony yellow fingers, which  Durham failed to comprehend. Finally the birdcage was withdrawn again,  and as it was passed before the light of the lantern he saw that it was  empty, whereas previously it had contained a number of tiny birds all  huddled up together!    The light gleamed upon the spectacles of Huang Chow. Watching him,  Durham saw him take out from a hidden drawer in the pedestal a long,  slender key, insert it in a lock concealed by the ornate carving,  and then slightly raise the lid which had so recently defied his own  efforts.    He raised it only a few inches, and then, taking up the lantern, peered  into the interior of the coffin, at the same time waving his hand  in dismissal to Ah Fu. For a while he stood there, peering into the  interior, and then, lowering the lid again, he relocked this gruesome  receptacle and, lantern in hand, began to mount the stair.    Durham inhaled deeply. He realized that during the last few seconds he  had been holding his breath. Now, as he began to creep back down the  slope, he discovered that his hands were shaking.    He dropped down into the court again, and for several minutes leaned  against the wall, endeavouring to reason out an explanation of what he  had seen, and in a measure to regain his composure.    There was a horror underlying it all which he was half afraid to face.  But the real clue to the mystery still eluded him.    Whether what he had witnessed were some kind of obscene ceremony,  or whether an explanation more vile must be sought, he remained  undetermined. He must repeat his exploit, if possible, and once more  gain access to the room which contained the lacquer coffin.    But the adventure was very distasteful. He recollected the smell of the  place, and the memory brought with it a sense of nausea. He thought of  Lala Huang, and his ideas became grotesque and chaotic. Yet the solution  of the mystery lay at last within his grasp, and to the zest of the  investigator everything else became subjugated.    He walked slowly away, silent in his rubber-soled shoes.          IX    THE PICTURE ON THE PAD        Lala Huang lay listening to the vague sounds which disturbed the silence  of the night. Presently her thoughts made her sigh wearily. During the  lifetime of her mother, who had died while Lala was yet a little girl,  life had been different and so much brighter.    She imagined that in the mingled sounds of dock and river which came to  her she could hear the roar of surf upon a golden beach. The stuffy  air of Limehouse took on the hot fragrance of a tropic island, and she  sighed again, but this time rapturously, for in spirit she was a child  once more, lulled by the voice of the great Pacific.    Young as she was, the death of her mother had been a blow from which it  had taken her several years to recover. Then had commenced those  long travels with her father, from port to port, from ocean to ocean,  sometimes settling awhile, but ever moving onward, onward.    He had had her educated after a fashion, and his love for her she did  not doubt. But her mother's blood spoke more strongly than that part of  her which was Chinese, and there was softness and a delicious languor in  her nature which her father did not seem to understand, and of which he  did not appear to approve.    She knew that he was wealthy. She knew that his ways were not straight  ways, although that part of his business to which he had admitted her as  an assistant, and an able one, was legitimate enough, or so it seemed.    Consignments of goods arrived at strange hours of the night at  the establishment in Limehouse, and from this side of her father's  transactions she was barred. The big double doors opening on the little  courtyard would be opened by Ah Fu, and packing cases of varying sizes  be taken in. Sometimes the sounds of these activities would reach her in  her room in a distant part of the house; but only in the morning would  she recognize their significance, when in the warehouse she would  discover that some new and choice pieces had arrived.    She wondered with what object her father accumulated wealth, and hoped,  against the promptings of her common sense, that he designed to return  East, there to seek a retirement amidst the familiar and the beautiful  things of the Orient which belonged to Lala's dream of heaven.    Stories about her father often reached her ears. She knew that he  had held high rank in China before she had been born; but that he had  sacrificed his rights in some way had always been her theory. She had  been too young to understand the stories which her mother had told her  sometimes; but that there were traits in the character of Huang Chow  which it was not good for his daughter to know she appreciated and  accepted as a secret sorrow.    He allowed her all the freedom to which her education entitled her. Her  life was that of a European and not of an Oriental woman. She loved him  in a way, but also feared him. She feared the dark and cruel side of his  character, of which, at various periods during their life together, she  had had terrifying glimpses.    She had decided that cruelty was his vice. In what way he gratified  it she had never learned, nor did she desire to do so. There were  periodical visits from the police, but she had learned long ago that her  father was too clever to place himself within reach of the law.    However crooked one part of his business methods might be, his dealings  with his clients were straight enough, so that no one had any object in  betraying him; and the legality or otherwise of his foreign relations  evidently afforded no case against him upon which the authorities could  act, or upon which they cared to act.    In America it had been graft which had protected him. She had learned  this accidentally, but never knew whether he bought his immunity in the  same way in London.    Some of the rumours which reached her were terrifying. Latterly she had  met many strange glances in her comings and goings about Limehouse. This  peculiar atmosphere had always preceded the break-up of every home which  they had shared. She divined the fact that in some way Huang Chow  had outstayed his welcome in Chinatown, London. Where their next  resting-place would be she could not imagine, but she prayed that it  might be in some more sunny clime.    She found herself to be thinking over much of John Hampden. His bona  fides were not above suspicion, but she could scarcely expect to meet a  really white man in such an environment.    Lala would have liked to think that he was white, but could not force  herself to do so. She would have liked to think that he sought her  company because she appealed to him personally; but she had detected  the fact that another motive underlay his attentions. She wondered if he  could be another of those moths drawn by the light of that fabled wealth  of her father.    It was curious, she reflected, that Huang Chow never checked--indeed,  openly countenanced--her friendship with the many chance acquaintances  she had made, even when her own instincts told her that the men were  crooked; so that, knowing the acumen of her father, she was well aware  that he must know it too.    Several of these pseudo lovers of hers had died. It was a point which  often occurred to her mind, but upon which she did not care to dwell  even now. But John Hampden--John Hampden was different. He was not  wholly sincere. She sighed wearily. But nevertheless he was not like  some of the others.    She started up in bed, seized with a sudden dreadful idea. He was a  detective!    She understood now why she had found so much that was white in him,  but so much that was false. His presence seemed to be very near her.  Something caressing in his voice echoed in her mind. She found herself  to be listening to the muted sounds of Limehouse and of the waterway  which flowed so close beside her.    That old longing for the home of her childhood returned tenfold, and  tears began to trickle down her cheeks. She was falling in love with  this man whose object was her father's ruin. A cold terror clutched  at her heart. Even now, while their friendship was so new, so strange,  there was a query, a stark, terrifying query, to stand up before her.    If put to the test, which would she choose?    She was unable to face that issue, and dropped back upon her pillow,  stifling a sob.    Yes, he was a detective. In some way her father had at last attracted  the serious attention of the law. Rumours of this were flying round  Chinatown, to which she had not been entirely deaf. She thought of a  hundred questions, a hundred silences, and grew more and more convinced  of the truth.    What did he mean to do? Before her a ghostly company uprose--the shadows  of some she had known with designs upon her father. John Hampden's  design was different. But might he not join that mysterious company?    Now again she suddenly sprang upright, this time because of a definite  sound which had reached her ears from within the house: a very faint,  bell-like tinkling which ceased almost immediately. She had heard it one  night before, and quite recently; indeed, on the night before she had  met John Hampden. Cohen--Cohen, the Jew, had died that night!    She sprang lightly on to the floor, found her slippers, and threw a silk  kimono over her nightrobe. She tiptoed cautiously to the door and opened  it.    It was at this very moment that old Huang Chow, asleep in his cell-like  apartment, was aroused by the tinkling of a bell set immediately above  his head. He awoke instantly, raised his hand and stopped the bell.  His expression, could anyone have been present to see it, was a thing"]]]
