C. At the inception of the labor, Solomon  entered into an agreement with Hiram, a neighboring king, whereby the  resources of Tyre and Sidon were annexed in the great undertaking.  Through this alliance the splendid forests of Lebanon were made  accessible; cedar, and fir, and other trees were felled and floated by  the thousand to the most convenient point for land transportation to  Jerusalem. It had been previously explained to Hiram that the demand  would be a heavy one, for, as Solomon had said: \"The house which I  build is great: for great is our God above all gods.\"[35] Sidonian  hewers were put to work,--the most skilful of all known woodmen; and  the timbers of Lebanon were supplied in abundance. The extent of the  demand may be judged from the enormous payment proffered and made by  Solomon.[36]    Israelitish workmen were employed in great numbers, both in  co-operation with the Sidonians and at home. Thus we read:        \"And King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was      thirty thousand men.        {35} \"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:      a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram      was over the levy.        \"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and      fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;        \"Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work,      three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that      wrought in the work.        \"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly      stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.        \"And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the      stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the      house.\"[37]    For the successful employment of such great numbers of workmen an  effective system of organization was necessary; we are not surprised,  therefore, in reading that thirty-three hundred overseers were in  service. The efficiency of the system is attested by the success  attending the great undertaking. The Israelites and the men of Tyre and  Sidon worked in harmony, and much of the building material was shaped  by pattern and measurement in forest and quarry; therefore \"the house,  when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was  brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool  of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.\"[38]    Our primary source of information relating to the erection of the great  Temple is the scriptural record contained in I Kings, chapters 6 and  7; a later account appears in II Chronicles, chapter 3 and 4, which  account as {36} well as the description given by Josephus[39] appears  to have been derived from the record first cited.    In general, the design of Solomon's Temple was that of the specially  constructed Tabernacle of the Congregation, though the dimensions of  the Temple were double those of the Tabernacle. It will be remembered  that the porch of the Tabernacle was five cubits deep; that of  the Temple measured ten cubits in depth; in each case the porch  extended across the full width of the house. The Holy Place, or first  compartment within the walls, was twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide  and ten high in the Tabernacle; that of the Temple was forty by twenty  cubits and twenty cubits high. The inner sanctuary, Oracle, or Holy of  Holies, in the Tabernacle was cubical and measured ten cubits each way;  in the Temple this sacred enclosure was a cube of twenty cubits. Thus  the ground plan of the Tabernacle covered thirty-five by twenty cubits,  and that of the Temple seventy cubits by forty. These measurements  do not take into account the side chambers, which in the Tabernacle  were five cubits wide; those connected with the Temple measured ten  cubits in extreme width; with these included, the entire area of the  Tabernacle was forty by twenty cubits, and that of the Temple eighty  by forty cubits; or, at the usually accepted equivalent for the cubit,  sixty by thirty feet for the Tabernacle, and one hundred and twenty  feet by sixty feet for the Temple. In height the same relation was  maintained; the Tabernacle rose fifteen cubits and the Temple thirty  cubits. The Temple porch appears to have towered above the height of  the main structure.[40]    {37} In the porch, standing as a guard at the threshold of the Temple,  were two brazen pillars, of elaborate design, and doubtless of  emblematical significance. They were regarded as of such importance  as to merit detailed description, and the name of their maker was  inscribed in the Temple archives. They were wrought by Hiram of  Tyre,--not the king who bore the same name--but a master-artisan,  skilled in the working of brass. Hiram fashioned the pillars, each  twelve cubits in circumference and eighteen cubits high exclusive of  the massive chapiters, which were ornamented with pomegranates and lily  work. The pillar at the right of the entrance was named Jachin, meaning  \"He shall establish,\" and that at the left was called Boaz, signifying  \"In it is strength.\"[41] Whatever deeper meaning may have been attached  to these massive columns, their suggestive symbolism of strength and  firmness is plainly apparent. As to whether they actually supported the  roof of the porch, or were free, standing as embellishments and symbols  alone, the scriptural text is not definite.    The walls of the great Temple were of hewn stone, yet on the inside no  stone was visible; for the walls were wainscotted from floor to ceiling  with cedar, richly decorated with carvings of flowers, trees, and other  designs, and the flooring was of fir.[42] Moreover, the interior was  richly embellished with overlaid work in pure gold. The partition by  which the Oracle or Holy of Holies was divided off, corresponding to  the veil in the Tabernacle, was thus overlaid, and was hung with chains  of gold.[43] The cherubim that stood as the symbol of guardianship {38}  over the Oracle were of olive wood, covered with gold, the precious  metal being fitted upon the carved work.[44]    The vestibule or porch stood at the east end; and this constituted the  only entrance to the Temple proper. On the other three sides, therefore  surrounding both the Holy Place and the Oracle, were numerous small  chambers, built in three tiers or stories. The width of these was five  cubits in the lowest story, six cubits in the middle, and seven cubits  in the top story; this peculiarity in width increasing with height was  made possible by the decrease in the thickness of the walls. By this  rebatement of the walls, the cedarn chambers were well supported yet  they formed no part of the main structure; it was so designed \"that  the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.\"[45] These  small apartments were therefore \"chambers round about, against the  walls of the house,\" yet of independent construction. From the mention  made by Ezekiel[46] these chambers are supposed to have numbered  thirty, though no precise specification is found. They were probably  used for service required of the priests aside from the ceremonial  labor connected with the general ritual. Entrance to these chambers was  provided on the right side of the building with winding stairs leading  to the upper rooms. Above the level of the upper chambers were windows  by which the outer apartment or Holy Place was lighted; the Holy of  Holies, however, was without natural light.    The furniture within the Temple comprised but few objects, yet every  piece was of special design and for exclusive use. In the Holy Place  stood the table, or a {39} series of tables to bear the sacred  shew-bread. Mention is made also of an altar of gold, and of ten  candlesticks of pure gold set in front of the entrance to the Oracle,  five on either side; furthermore there were tongs of gold, bowls and  snuffers, basins and spoons. The Oracle was prepared for the reception  of the Ark of the Covenant, and to overshadow that holy vessel there  were prepared the two great cherubim, each ten cubits high; these were  of olive wood overlaid with gold.    The Temple stood within walled enclosures, generally spoken of as outer  and inner courts respectively. The wall of the inner court is described  as consisting of three courses of hewn stone, in which was set a course  of cedar beams. This corresponded to the single enclosure of the  ancient Tabernacle. Inasmuch as all the specified measurements show  the Temple to have been double the size of the Tabernacle, this court  may have been of corresponding proportion; it is therefore generally  believed to have extended one hundred cubits north and south and two  hundred cubits east and west.[47]    Within the court, \"before the porch of the Lord\" stood the altar of  sacrifice. This was of brass twenty cubits square and ten cubits high.  To the service of the altar belonged many of the utensils such as  basins, pots, and shovels, specially made under the direction of the  master craftsman, Hiram of Tyre. Another prominent object within the  court was the molten sea, called also the brazen sea.[48] This great  font measured thirty cubits in circumference and stood five cubits  high, and was richly {40} ornamented.

If large towns were lighted in  the same manner, the materials would rise in price: the whole amount  at present produced would scarcely suffice for two such towns as  Berlin and Munich. But no just calculation can be made from the  present prices of turpentine, resin, &c., which are not produced  upon any large scale.    [Footnote 1: Malter--a measure containing several bushels, but  varying in different countries.]    [Footnote 2: Klafter--a cord, a stack, measuring six feet every  way.]          LETTER V      My dear Sir,    Until very recently it was supposed that the physical qualities of  bodies, i.e. hardness, colour, density, transparency, &c., and still  more their chemical properties, must depend upon the nature of their  elements, or upon their composition. It was tacitly received as a  principle, that two bodies containing the same elements in the same  proportion, must of necessity possess the same properties. We could  not imagine an exact identity of composition giving rise to two  bodies entirely different in their sensible appearance and chemical  relations. The most ingenious philosophers entertained the opinion  that chemical combination is an inter-penetration of the particles  of different kinds of matter, and that all matter is susceptible of  infinite division. This has proved to be altogether a mistake. If  matter were infinitely divisible in this sense, its particles must  be imponderable, and a million of such molecules could not weigh  more than an infinitely small one. But the particles of that  imponderable matter, which, striking upon the retina, give us the  sensation of light, are not in a mathematical sense infinitely  small.    Inter-penetration of elements in the production of a chemical  compound, supposes two distinct bodies, A and B, to occupy one and  the same space at the same time. If this were so, different  properties could not consist with an equal and identical  composition.    That hypothesis, however, has shared the fate of innumerable  imaginative explanations of natural phenomena, in which our  predecessors indulged. They have now no advocate. The force of  truth, dependent upon observation, is irresistible. A great many  substances have been discovered amongst organic bodies, composed of  the same elements in the same relative proportions, and yet  exhibiting physical and chemical properties perfectly distinct one  from another. To such substances the term Isomeric (from 1/ao1/  equal and aei1/o1/ part) is applied. A great class of bodies, known  as the volatile oils, oil of turpentine, essence of lemons, oil of  balsam of copaiba, oil of rosemary, oil of juniper, and many others,  differing widely from each other in their odour, in their medicinal  effects, in their boiling point, in their specific gravity, &c., are  exactly identical in composition,--they contain the same elements,  carbon and hydrogen, in the same proportions.    How admirably simple does the chemistry of organic nature present  itself to us from this point of view! An extraordinary variety of  compound bodies produced with equal weights of two elements! and how  wide their dissimilarity! The crystallised part of the oil of roses,  the delicious fragrance of which is so well known, a solid at  ordinary temperatures, although readily volatile, is a compound body  containing exactly the same elements, and in the same proportions,  as the gas we employ for lighting our streets; and, in short, the  same elements, in the same relative quantities, are found in a dozen  other compounds, all differing essentially in their physical and  chemical properties.    These remarkable truths, so highly important in their applications,  were not received and admitted as sufficiently established, without  abundant proofs. Many examples have long been known where the  analysis of two different bodies gave the same composition; but such  cases were regarded as doubtful: at any rate, they were isolated  observations, homeless in the realms of science: until, at length,  examples were discovered of two or more bodies whose absolute  identity of composition, with totally distinct properties, could be  demonstrated in a more obvious and conclusive manner than by mere  analysis; that is, they can be converted and reconverted into each  other without addition and without subtraction.    In cyanuric acid, hydrated cyanic acid, and cyamelide, we have three  such isomeric compounds.    Cyanuric acid is crystalline, soluble in water, and capable of  forming salts with metallic oxides.    Hydrated cyanic acid is a volatile and highly blistering fluid,  which cannot be brought into contact with water without being  instantaneously decomposed.    Cyamelide is a white substance very like porcelain, absolutely  insoluble in water.    Now if we place the first,--cyanuric acid,--in a vessel hermetically  sealed, and apply a high degree of heat, it is converted by its  influence into hydrated cyanic acid; and, then, if this is kept for  some time at the common temperature, it passes into cyamelide, no  other element being present. And, again inversely, cyamelide can be  converted into cyanuric acid and hydrated cyanic acid.    We have three other bodies which pass through similar changes, in  aldehyde, metaldehyde, and etaldehyde; and, again two, in urea and  cyanuret of ammonia. Further, 100 parts of aldehyde hydrated butyric  acid and acetic ether contain the same elements in the same  proportion. Thus one substance may be converted into another without  addition or subtraction, and without the participation of any  foreign bodies in the change.    The doctrine that matter is not infinitely divisible, but on the  contrary, consists of atoms incapable of further division, alone  furnishes us with a satisfactory explanation of these phenomena. In  chemical combinations, the ultimate atoms of bodies do not penetrate  each other, they are only arranged side by side in a certain order,  and the properties of the compound depend entirely upon this order.  If they are made to change their place--their mode of arrangement--by  an impulse from without, they combine again in a different manner,  and another compound is formed with totally different properties. We  may suppose that one atom combines with one atom of another element  to form a compound atom, while in other bodies two and two, four and  four, eight and eight, are united; so that in all such compounds the  amount per cent. of the elements is absolutely equal; and yet their  physical and chemical properties must be totally different, the  constitution of each atom being peculiar, in one body consisting of  two, in another of four, in a third of eight, and in a fourth of  sixteen simple atoms.    The discovery of these facts immediately led to many most beautiful  and interesting results; they furnished us with a satisfactory  explanation of observations which were before veiled in mystery,--a  key to many of Nature's most curious recesses.    Again; solid bodies, whether simple or compound, are capable of  existing in two states, which are known by the terms amorphous and  crystalline.    When matter is passing from a gaseous or liquid state slowly into a  solid, an incessant motion is observed, as if the molecules were  minute magnets; they are seen to repel each other in one direction,  and to attract and cohere together in another, and in the end become  arranged into a regular form, which under equal circumstances is  always the same for any given kind of matter; that is, crystals are  formed.    Time and freedom of motion for the particles of bodies are necessary  to the formation of crystals. If we force a fluid or a gas to become  suddenly solid, leaving no time for its particles to arrange  themselves, and cohere in that direction in which the cohesive  attraction is strongest, no crystals will be formed, but the  resulting solid will have a different colour, a different degree of  hardness and cohesion, and will refract light differently; in one  word, will be amorphous. Thus we have cinnabar as a red and a  jet-black substance; sulphur a fixed and brittle body, and soft,  semitransparent, and ductile; glass as a milk-white opaque  substance, so hard that it strikes fire with steel, and in its  ordinary and well-known state. These dissimilar states and  properties of the same body are occasioned in one case by a regular,  in the other by an irregular, arrangement of its atoms; one is  crystalline, the other amorphous.    Applying these facts to natural productions, we have reason to  believe that clay-slate, and many kinds of greywacke, are amorphous  feldspar, as transition limestone is amorphous marble, basalt and  lava mixtures of amorphous zeolite and augite. Anything that  influences the cohesion, must also in a certain degree alter the  properties of bodies. Carbonate of lime, if crystallised at ordinary  temperatures, possesses the crystalline form, hardness, and  refracting power of common spar; if crystallised at a higher  temperature, it has the form and properties of arragonite.    Finally, Isomorphism, or the equality of form of many chemical  compounds having a different composition, tends to prove that matter  consists of atoms the mere arrangement of which produces all the  properties of bodies. But when we find that a different arrangement  of the same elements gives rise to various physical and chemical  properties, and a similar arrangement of different elements produces  properties very much the same, may we not inquire whether some of  those bodies which we regard as elements may not be merely  modifications of the same substance?--whether they are not the same  matter in a different state of arrangement? We know in fact the  existence of iron in two states, so dissimilar, that in the one, it  is to the electric chain like platinum, and in the"]]]
