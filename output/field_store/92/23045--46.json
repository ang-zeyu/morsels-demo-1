We see this at the period when the most powerful religious  revolution recorded by history overthrew paganism to substitute a  God who came from the plains of Galilee.  The new ideal demanded  the renunciation of all the joys of existence in order to  acquire the eternal happiness of heaven.  No doubt such an ideal  was readily accepted by the poor, the enslaved, the disinherited  who were deprived of all the joys of life here below, to whom an  enchanting future was offered in exchange for a life without  hope.  But the austere existence so easily embraced by the poor  was also embraced by the rich.  In this above all was the power  of the new faith manifested.    Not only did the Christian revolution transform manners: it also  exercised, for a space of two thousand years, a preponderating  influence over civilisation.  Directly a religious faith triumphs  all the elements of civilisation naturally adapt themselves to  it, so that civilisation is rapidly transformed.  Writers,  artists and philosophers merely symbolise, in their works, the  ideas of the new faith.    When any religious or political faith whatsoever has triumphed,  not only is reason powerless to affect it, but it even finds  motives which impel it to interpret and so justify the faith in  question, and to strive to impose it upon others.  There were  probably as many theologians and orators in the time of Moloch,  to prove the utility of human sacrifices, as there were at other  periods to glorify the Inquisition, the massacre of St.  Bartholomew, and the hecatombs of the Terror.    We must not hope to see peoples possessed by strong beliefs  readily achieve tolerance.  The only people who attained to  toleration in the ancient world were the polytheists.  The  nations which practise toleration at the present time are those  that might well be termed polytheistical, since, as in England  and America, they are divided into innumerable sects.  Under identical names they really adore very different deities.    The multiplicity of beliefs which results in such toleration  finally results also in weakness.  We therefore come to a  psychological problem not hitherto resolved: how to possess a  faith at once powerful and tolerant.    The foregoing brief explanation reveals the large part played by  religious revolutions and the power of beliefs.  Despite their  slight rational value they shape history, and prevent the peoples  from remaining a mass of individuals without cohesion or  strength.  Man has needed them at all times to orientate his  thought and guide his conduct.  No philosophy has as yet  succeeded in replacing them.        CHAPTER III    THE ACTION OF GOVERNMENTS IN REVOLUTIONS    1.  The feeble resistance of Governments in time of Revolution.    Many modern nations--France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland,  Japan, Turkey, Portugal, &c.--have known revolutions within the  last century.  These were usually characterised by their  instantaneous quality and the facility with which the governments  attacked were overthrown.    The instantaneous nature of these revolutions is explained by the  rapidity of mental contagion due to modern methods of publicity.  The slight resistance of the governments attacked is more  surprising.  It implies a total inability to comprehend and  foresee created by a blind confidence in their own strength.    The facility with which governments fall is not however a new  phenomenon.  It has been proved more than once, not only in  autocratic systems, which are always overturned by palace  conspiracies, but also in governments perfectly instructed in the  state of public opinion by the press and their own agents.    Among these instantaneous downfalls one of the most striking was  that which followed the Ordinances of Charles X.  This monarch  was, as we know, overthrown in four days.  His minister  Polignac had taken no measures of defence, and the king was so  confident of the tranquillity of Paris that he had gone hunting.  The army was not in the least hostile, as in the reign of Louis  XVI., but the troops, badly officered, disbanded before the  attacks of a few insurgents.    The overthrow of Louis-Philippe was still more typical, since it  did not result from any arbitrary action on the part of the  sovereign.  This monarch was not surrounded by the hatred which  finally surrounded Charles X., and his fall was the result of an  insignificant riot which could easily have been repressed.    Historians, who can hardly comprehend how a solidly constituted  government, supported by an imposing army, can be overthrown by a  few rioters, naturally attributed the fall of Louis-Philippe to  deep-seated causes.  In reality the incapacity of the generals  entrusted with his defence was the real cause of his fall.    This case is one of the most instructive that could be cited, and  is worthy of a moment's consideration.  It has been perfectly  investigated by General Bonnal, in the light of the notes of an  eye-witness, General Elchingen.  Thirty-six thousand troops were  then in Paris, but the weakness and incapacity of their officers  made it impossible to use them.  Contradictory orders were given,  and finally the troops were forbidden to fire on the people, who,  moreover--and nothing could have been more dangerous--were  permitted to mingle with the troops.  The riot succeeded without  fighting and forced the king to abdicate.    Applying to the preceding case our knowledge of the  psychology of crowds, General Bonnal shows how easily the riot  which overthrew Louis-Philippe could have been controlled.  He  proves, notably, that if the commanding officers had not  completely lost their heads quite a small body of troops could  have prevented the insurgents from invading the Chamber of  Deputies.  This last, composed of monarchists, would certainly  have proclaimed the Count of Paris under the regency of his  mother.    Similar phenomena were observable in the revolutions of Spain and  Portugal.    These facts show the role of petty accessory circumstances  in great events, and prove that one must not speak too readily of  the general laws of history.  Without the riot which overthrew  Louis-Philippe, we should probably have seen neither the Republic  of 1848, nor the Second Empire, nor Sedan, nor the invasion, nor  the loss of Alsace.    In the revolutions of which I have just been speaking the army  was of no assistance to the government, but did not turn against  it.  It sometimes happens otherwise.  It is often the army which  effects the revolution, as in Turkey and Portugal.  The  innumerable revolutions of the Latin republics of America are  effected by the army.    When a revolution is effected by an army the new rulers naturally  fall under its domination.  I have already recalled the fact that  this was the case at the end of the Roman Empire, when the  emperors were made and unmade by the soldiery.    The same thing has sometimes been witnessed in modern times.  The  following extract from a newspaper, with reference to the  Greek revolution, shows what becomes of a government dominated by  its army:--    ``One day it was announced that eighty officers of the navy would  send in their resignations if the government did not dismiss the  leaders of whom they complained.  Another time it was the  agricultural labourers on a farm (metairie) belonging to the  Crown Prince who demanded the partition of the soil among them.  The navy protested against the promotion promised to Colonel  Zorbas.  Colonel Zorbas, after a week of discussion with  Lieutenant Typaldos, treated with the President of the Council as  one power with another.  During this time the Federation of the  corporations abused the officers of the navy.  A deputy demanded  that these officers and their families should be treated as  brigands.  When Commander Miaoulis fired on the rebels, the  sailors, who first of all had obeyed Typaldos, returned to duty.  This is no longer the harmonious Greece of Pericles and  Themistocles.  It is a hideous camp of Agramant.''    A revolution cannot be effected without the assistance or at  least the neutrality of the army, but it often happens that the  movement commences without it.  This was the case with the  revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and that of 1870, which overthrew  the Empire after the humiliation of France by the surrender of  Sedan.    The majority of revolutions take place in the capitals, and by  means of contagion spread through the country; but this is not a  constant rule.  We know that during the French Revolution La  Vendee, Brittany, and the Midi revolted spontaneously against  Paris.      2.  How the resistance of Governments may overcome Revolution.      In the greater number of the revolutions enumerated above, we  have seen governments perish by their weakness.  As soon as they  were touched they fell.    The Russian Revolution proved that a government which defends  itself energetically may finally triumph.    Never was revolution more menacing to the government.  After the  disasters suffered in the Orient, and the severities of a too  oppressive autocratic regime, all classes of society, including a  portion of the army and the fleet, had revolted.  The railways,  posts, and telegraph services had struck, so that communications  between the various portions of the vast empire were interrupted.    The rural class itself, forming the majority of the nation, began  to feel the influence of the revolutionary propaganda.  The lot  of the peasants was wretched.  They were obliged, by the system  of the mir, to cultivate soil which they could not acquire.  The  government resolved immediately to conciliate this large class of  peasants by turning them into proprietors.  Special laws forced  the landlords to sell the peasants a portion of their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#7)"],[1,"to the earth. After duly weighing  the whole matter in my mind I saw clearly that these things were  true; and that myself and the whole world were without baptism, and  without the ministry and ordinances of God; and that the whole  world had been in this condition since the days that inspiration  and revelation had ceased--in short, that this was a _new  dispensation or commission_, in fulfillment of prophecy, and  for the restoration of Israel, and to prepare the way before the  second coming of the Lord.    In the morning I was compelled to take leave of this worthy man  and his family--as I had to hasten back a distance of thirty miles,  on foot, to fulfil an appointment in the evening. As we parted he  kindly presented me with a copy of the Book of Mormon. I had not  yet completed its perusal, and was glad indeed to possess a copy of  my own. I travelled on a few miles, and, stopping to rest, I  commenced again to read the book. To my great joy I found that  Jesus Christ, in his glorified resurrected body, had appeared to  the remnant of Joseph on the continent of America, soon after his  resurrection and ascension into heaven; and that he also  administered, in person, to the ten lost tribes; and that through  his personal ministry in these countries his gospel was revealed  and written in countries and among nations entirely unknown to the  Jewish apostles.    Thus revealed, written, handed down and preserved, till revealed  in this age by the angels of God, it had, of course, escaped the  corruptions of the great and abominable church; and been preserved  in purity.    This discovery greatly enlarged my heart, and filled my soul  with joy and gladness. I esteemed the Book, or the information  contained in it, more than all the riches of the world. Yes; I  verily believe that I would not at that time have exchanged the  knowledge I then possessed, for a legal title to all the beautiful  farms, houses, villages and property which passed in review before  me, on my journey through one of the most flourishing settlements  of western New York.    Surely, thought I, Jesus had _other sheep_, as he said to  his Apostles of old; and here they were, in the wilderness of the  world called new. And they heard the voice of the Good Shepherd of  Israel; and he brought them to his fold. Truly, thought I, he was  not sent (in person) save to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,  as he told the woman of Canaan; and here were a portion of them.  Truly, thought I, the angels sung with the spirit and with the  understanding when they declared: \"_We bring you glad tidings of  great joy, which shall be to_ ALL PEOPLE.\"    In his mortal tabernacle he confined his ministry and that of  his Apostles to the land of Judea; but afterwards, released from  the bonds of mortal life, or rather death, and clothed with an  immortal body, and with organs strong and lasting as the immortal  mind, he possessed all power in heaven and on earth; he was then  enabled to extend his ministry to heaven, earth or hell. He could  take the wings of the morning, and, with the speed of light, make  his way to the Heaven of Heavens; and converse and counsel among  the sons of God; or receive counsel from his Father in Heaven; or,  leaving again the starry worlds, he could descend to the dark and  gloomy abodes of the spirits in prison and preach to them the  gospel--bursting off their shackles and unlocking their prison  doors; while these once dark abodes were now brilliant with light,  and, instead of prison groans, were heard joyful acclamations of  deliverance to the captive, and the opening of the prison to them  that are bound; or coming again to visit the earth, he could soar  away beyond the waves and tempests, which had before set bounds to  the geographical knowledge of man, and stood up as an impregnable  barrier to the intercourse of nations; and there, in other tribes  and tongues, make known the riches of his grace, and his _triumph  _ over death.    And when ages had passed, and nations slumbered in the  dust--when cruelty and bloodshed had blotted almost every trace of  priesthood and apostleship from the earth; when saints had been  worn out and overcome times, laws and ordinances changed; the Bible  itself robbed of its plainness; and all things darkened and  corrupted; a pure and faithful record of his ministry to other  nations is forthcoming from among the archives of the dead, to  reveal the \"_mystery of iniquity_;\" to speak, as with a voice of  thunder, in rebuking the evil and revealing the fullness of the  gospel. Such was the Book of Mormon--much its effect upon the  startling nations.      CHAPTER VI.  ------------------------    Interesting Meetings:--Second Interview with Hyrum Smith:--Visit  to the Church in Seneca County:--Baptism, Confirmation and  Ordination:--Ministry Among my Kindred:--Baptism of my Brother  Orson:--Wonderful Sign in the Heavens:--Return to Western New  York:--First Interview with Joseph Smith:--Description of his Person  and Abilities.    Having rested awhile and perused this sacred book by the  roadside, I again walked on.    In the evening I arrived in time to fill my appointment. I met a  crowded house, and laid before them many interesting truths, which  were listened to with deep interest.    The next evening I had another appointment, and the people came  out in great numbers, and were filled with the spirit of interest  and inquiry.    They urged me very much to continue my discourses among them;  but I felt to minister no more till I had attended to some  important duties for myself. I had now found men on earth  commissioned to preach, baptize, ordain to the ministry, etc., and  I determined to obey the fullness of the gospel without delay. I  should have done so at the first interview with Elder Hyrum Smith;  but these two appointments were already out, and thirty miles'  travel required all the time I had.    I now returned immediately to Hyrum Smith's residence, and  demanded baptism at his hands. I tarried with him one night, and  the next day we walked some twenty-five miles to the residence of  Mr. Whitmer, in Seneca County. Here we arrived in the evening, and  found a most welcome reception.    This was the family, several of whose names were attached to the  Book of Mormon as witnesses--Mr. Joseph Smith having translated  much of the book in Whitmer's chamber.    I found the little branch of the Church in this place full of  joy, faith, humility and charity. We rested that night, and on the  next day, being about the 1st of September, 1830, I was baptized by  the hand of an Apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ, by the name  of Oliver Cowdery. This took place in Seneca Lake, a beautiful and  transparent sheet of water in Western New York.    A meeting was held the same evening, and after singing a hymn  and prayer, Elder Cowdery and others proceeded to lay their hands  upon my head in the name of Jesus, for the gift of the Holy Ghost.  After which I was ordained to the office of an Elder in the Church,  which included authority to preach, baptize, and minister the  sacrament, administer the Holy Spirit, by the laying on of hands in  the name of Jesus Christ and to take the lead of meetings of  worship.    I now felt that I had authority in the ministry.    On the next Sabbath I preached to a large concourse of people,  assembled at the house of a Mr. Burroughs. The Holy Ghost came upon  me mightily. I spoke the word of God with power, reasoning out of  the Scriptures and the Book of Mormon. The people were convinced,  overwhelmed in tears, and four heads of families came forward  expressing their faith, and were baptized.    My work was now completed, for which I took leave of my wife and  the canal boat some two or three weeks previous.    I now took leave of the little branch of the church with which I  had been associated, and pursued my journey to the land of my  fathers and of my boyhood.    I found my wife in health and spirits, enjoying herself with her  friends. I also found my father and mother, friends and kindred,  and, among others, my good old aunt and cousins, at the old  homestead, where I always found a welcome reception.    This was a pleasant and retired mountain valley, consisting of a  beautiful farm and a small and convenient house, out-buildings,  orchard, meadow, etc., encircled on the south, west and north with  a curve of hills, consisting of farming lands and pasture, and  their summits and bosoms partially clothed with a beautiful forest  of pine and chestnut; while the scene opened to the southeast in a  descending landscape to a beautiful vale of some miles in extent,  filled with flourishing farms and dwellings, and watered by a  winding stream; while far beyond stretched other hills and  pine-clad mountains, and the spire of a church and a small town  were seen nestling among the hills at two miles distance.    This was the residence of my aunt Van Cott, and the place where  I had spent some of the happiest seasons of my youth. My aunt had  three children--an only son, and two daughters. These were now in  the bloom of early youth, and were fast advancing to a state of  maturity. Her husband had died at an early day, after an illness of  seven years; and here lived the widow and orphans, surrounded with  peace and plenty, blooming with health, and smiling with innocence  and joy. Retired from the throng of busy, boisterous life, and  strangers to most of its woes, ills and corruptions, the stranger  who happened there was welcome; the hungry were fed, the naked were  clothed, and, above all, the kindred found a hearty reception. In  short, it was a spot, in all respects, adapted to retirement and  contemplation, where the poet and the novelist would find a  thousand things to please the imagination, and to swell their  favorite volumes.    In this visit to my native place, there was one family greatly  missed by me. I felt keenly the"]]]
