Something similar may be noticed in the music of Wagner. His  famous leitmotiv is an attempt to give personality to his  characters by something beyond theatrical expedients and light  effect. His method of using a definite motiv is a purely musical  method. It creates a spiritual atmosphere by means of a musical  phrase which precedes the hero, which he seems to radiate forth  from any distance. [Footnote: Frequent attempts have shown that  such a spiritual atmosphere can belong not only to heroes but to  any human being. Sensitives cannot, for example, remain in a room  in which a person has been who is spiritually antagonistic to  them, even though they know nothing of his existence.] The most  modern musicians like Debussy create a spiritual impression,  often taken from nature, but embodied in purely musical form. For  this reason Debussy is often classed with the Impressionist  painters on the ground that he resembles these painters in using  natural phenomena for the purposes of his art. Whatever truth  there may be in this comparison merely accentuates the fact that  the various arts of today learn from each other and often  resemble each other. But it would be rash to say that this  definition is an exhaustive statement of Debussy's significance.  Despite his similarity with the Impressionists this musician is  deeply concerned with spiritual harmony, for in his works one  hears the suffering and tortured nerves of the present time. And  further Debussy never uses the wholly material note so  characteristic of programme music, but trusts mainly in the  creation of a more abstract impression. Debussy has been greatly  influenced by Russian music, notably by Mussorgsky. So it is not  surprising that he stands in close relation to the young Russian  composers, the chief of whom is Scriabin. The experience of the  hearer is frequently the same during the performance of the works  of these two musicians. He is often snatched quite suddenly from  a series of modern discords into the charm of more or less  conventional beauty. He feels himself often insulted, tossed  about like a tennis ball over the net between the two parties of  the outer and the inner beauty. To those who are not accustomed  to it the inner beauty appears as ugliness because humanity in  general inclines to the outer and knows nothing of the inner.  Almost alone in severing himself from conventional beauty is the  Austrian composer, Arnold Schonberg. He says in his  Harmonielehre: \"Every combination of notes, every advance is  possible, but I am beginning to feel that there are also definite  rules and conditions which incline me to the use of this or that  dissonance.\" [Footnote: \"Die Musik,\" p. 104, from the  Harmonielehre (Verlag der Universal Edition).] This means that  Schonberg realizes that the greatest freedom of all, the freedom  of an unfettered art, can never be absolute. Every age achieves a  certain measure of this freedom, but beyond the boundaries of its  freedom the mightiest genius can never go. But the measure of  freedom of each age must be constantly enlarged. Schonberg is  endeavouring to make complete use of his freedom and has already  discovered gold mines of new beauty in his search for spiritual  harmony. His music leads us into a realm where musical experience  is a matter not of the ear but of the soul alone--and from this  point begins the music of the future.    A parallel course has been followed by the Impressionist movement  in painting. It is seen in its dogmatic and most naturalistic  form in so-called Neo-Impressionism. The theory of this is to put  on the canvas the whole glitter and brilliance of nature, and not  only an isolated aspect of her.    It is interesting to notice three practically contemporary and  totally different groups in painting. They are (1) Rossetti and  his pupil Burne-Jones, with their followers; (2) Bocklin and his  school; (3) Segantini, with his unworthy following of  photographic artists. I have chosen these three groups to  illustrate the search for the abstract in art. Rossetti sought to  revive the non-materialism of the pre-Raphaelites. Bocklin busied  himself with the mythological scenes, but was in contrast to  Rossetti in that he gave strongly material form to his legendary  figures. Segantini, outwardly the most material of the three,  selected the most ordinary objects (hills, stones, cattle, etc.)  often painting them with the minutest realism, but he never  failed to create a spiritual as well as a material value, so that  really he is the most non-material of the trio.    These men sought for the \"inner\" by way of the \"outer.\"    By another road, and one more purely artistic, the great seeker  after a new sense of form approached the same problem. Cezanne  made a living thing out of a teacup, or rather in a teacup he  realized the existence of something alive. He raised still life  to such a point that it ceased to be inanimate.    He painted these things as he painted human beings, because he  was endowed with the gift of divining the inner life in  everything. His colour and form are alike suitable to the  spiritual harmony. A man, a tree, an apple, all were used by  Cezanne in the creation of something that is called a \"picture,\"  and which is a piece of true inward and artistic harmony. The  same intention actuates the work of one of the greatest of the  young Frenchmen, Henri Matisse. He paints \"pictures,\" and in  these \"pictures\" endeavours to reproduce the divine.[Footnote:  Cf. his article in KUNST UND KUNSTLER, 1909, No. 8.] To attain  this end he requires as a starting point nothing but the object  to be painted (human being or whatever it may be), and then the  methods that belong to painting alone, colour and form.    By personal inclination, because he is French and because he is  specially gifted as a colourist, Matisse is apt to lay too much  stress on the colour. Like Debussy, he cannot always refrain from  conventional beauty; Impressionism is in his blood. One sees  pictures of Matisse which are full of great inward vitality,  produced by the stress of the inner need, and also pictures which  possess only outer charm, because they were painted on an outer  impulse. (How often one is reminded of Manet in this.) His work  seems to be typical French painting, with its dainty sense of  melody, raised from time to time to the summit of a great hill  above the clouds.    But in the work of another great artist in Paris, the Spaniard Pablo  Picasso, there is never any suspicion of this conventional beauty.  Tossed hither and thither by the need for self-expression, Picasso  hurries from one manner to another. At times a great gulf appears  between consecutive manners, because Picasso leaps boldly and is found  continually by his bewildered crowd of followers standing at a point  very different from that at which they saw him last. No sooner do they  think that they have reached him again than he has changed once more. In  this way there arose Cubism, the latest of the French movements, which  is treated in detail in Part II. Picasso is trying to arrive at  constructiveness by way of proportion. In his latest works (1911) he has  achieved the logical destruction of matter, not, however, by dissolution  but rather by a kind of a parcelling out of its various divisions and a  constructive scattering of these divisions about the canvas. But he  seems in this most recent work distinctly desirous of keeping an  appearance of matter. He shrinks from no innovation, and if colour seems  likely to balk him in his search for a pure artistic form, he throws it  overboard and paints a picture in brown and white; and the problem of  purely artistic form is the real problem of his life.    In their pursuit of the same supreme end Matisse and Picasso  stand side by side, Matisse representing colour and Picasso form.        IV. THE PYRAMID        And so at different points along the road are the different arts,  saying what they are best able to say, and in the language which  is peculiarly their own. Despite, or perhaps thanks to, the  differences between them, there has never been a time when the  arts approached each other more nearly than they do today, in  this later phase of spiritual development.    In each manifestation is the seed of a striving towards the  abstract, the non-material. Consciously or unconsciously they are  obeying Socrates' command--Know thyself. Consciously or  unconsciously artists are studying and proving their material,  setting in the balance the spiritual value of those elements,  with which it is their several privilege to work.    And the natural result of this striving is that the various arts  are drawing together. They are finding in Music the best teacher.  With few exceptions music has been for some centuries the art  which has devoted itself not to the reproduction of natural  phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul, in  musical sound.    A painter, who finds no satisfaction in mere representation,  however artistic, in his longing to express his inner life,  cannot but envy the ease with which music, the most non-material  of the arts today, achieves this end. He naturally seeks to apply  the methods of music to his own art. And from this results that  modern desire for rhythm in painting, for mathematical, abstract  construction, for repeated notes of colour, for setting colour in  motion.    This borrowing of method by one art from another, can only be  truly successful when the application of the borrowed methods is  not superficial but fundamental. One art must learn first how  another uses its methods, so that the methods may afterwards be  applied to the borrower's art from the beginning, and suitably.  The artist must not forget that in him lies the power of true  application of every method,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#7)"],[1,"for the sumac with what grace he could command.    There was an hour of angry recrimination before sweet peace brooded  again in Rainbow Bottom.  The newly mated pair finally made up; the  females speedily resumed their coquetting, and forgot the captivating  stranger--all save the poor little one that had been kissed by  accident.  She never had been kissed before, and never had expected  that she would be, for she was a creature of many misfortunes of every  nature.    She had been hatched from a fifth egg to begin with; and every one  knows the disadvantage of beginning life with four sturdy older birds  on top of one.  It was a meager egg, and a feeble baby that pipped its  shell.  The remainder of the family stood and took nearly all the food  so that she almost starved in the nest, and she never really knew the  luxury of a hearty meal until her elders had flown.  That lasted only a  few days; for the others went then, and their parents followed them so  far afield that the poor little soul, clamouring alone in the nest,  almost perished. Hunger-driven, she climbed to the edge and exercised  her wings until she managed some sort of flight to a neighbouring bush.  She missed the twig and fell to the ground, where she lay cold and  shivering.    She cried pitifully, and was almost dead when a brown-faced, barefoot  boy, with a fishing-pole on his shoulder, passed and heard her.    \"Poor little thing, you are almost dead,\" he said.  \"I know what I'll  do with you.  I'll take you over and set you in the bushes where I  heard those other redbirds, and then your ma will feed you.\"    The boy turned back and carefully set her on a limb close to one of her  brothers, and there she got just enough food to keep her alive.    So her troubles continued.  Once a squirrel chased her, and she saved  herself by crowding into a hole so small her pursuer could not follow.  The only reason she escaped a big blue racer when she went to take her  first bath, was that a hawk had his eye on the snake and snapped it up  at just the proper moment to save the poor, quivering little bird.  She  was left so badly frightened that she could not move for a long time.    All the tribulations of birdland fell to her lot.  She was so frail and  weak she lost her family in migration, and followed with some strangers  that were none too kind.  Life in the South had been full of trouble.  Once a bullet grazed her so closely she lost two of her wing quills,  and that made her more timid than ever.  Coming North, she had given  out again and finally had wandered into Rainbow Bottom, lost and alone.    She was such a shy, fearsome little body, the females all flouted her;  and the males never seemed to notice that there was material in her for  a very fine mate.  Every other female cardinal in Rainbow Bottom had  several males courting her, but this poor, frightened, lonely one had  never a suitor; and she needed love so badly!  Now she had been kissed  by this magnificent stranger!    Of course, she knew it really was not her kiss.  He had intended it for  the bold creature that had answered his challenge, but since it came to  her, it was hers, in a way, after all.  She hid in the underbrush for  the remainder of the day, and was never so frightened in all her life.  She brooded over it constantly, and morning found her at the down curve  of the horseshoe, straining her ears for the rarest note she ever had  heard.  All day she hid and waited, and the following days were filled  with longing, but he never came again.    So one morning, possessed with courage she did not understand, and  filled with longing that drove her against her will, she started down  the river.  For miles she sneaked through the underbrush, and watched  and listened; until at last night came, and she returned to Rainbow  Bottom.  The next morning she set out early and flew to the spot from  which she had turned back the night before.  From there she glided  through the bushes and underbrush, trembling and quaking, yet pushing  stoutly onward, straining her ears for some note of the brilliant  stranger's.    It was mid-forenoon when she reached the region of the sumac, and as  she hopped warily along, only a short distance from her, full and  splendid, there burst the voice of the singer for whom she was  searching.  She sprang into air, and fled a mile before she realized  that she was flying.  Then she stopped and listened, and rolling with  the river, she heard those bold true tones.  Close to earth, she went  back again, to see if, unobserved, she could find a spot where she  might watch the stranger that had kissed her. When at last she reached  a place where she could see him plainly, his beauty was so bewildering,  and his song so enticing that she gradually hopped closer and closer  without knowing she was moving.    High in the sumac the Cardinal had sung until his throat was parched,  and the fountain of hope was almost dry.  There was nothing save defeat  from overwhelming numbers in Rainbow Bottom.  He had paraded, and made  all the music he ever had been taught, and improvised much more.  Yet  no one had come to seek him.  Was it of necessity to be the Limberlost  then? This one day more he would retain his dignity and his location.  He tipped, tilted, and flirted.  He whistled, and sang, and trilled.  Over the lowland and up and down the shining river, ringing in every  change he could invent, he sent for the last time his prophetic  message, \"Wet year! Wet year!\"        Chapter 3    \"Come here! Come here!\" entreated the Cardinal      He felt that his music was not reaching his standard as he burst into  this new song.  He was almost discouraged.  No way seemed open to him  but flight to the Limberlost, and he so disdained the swamp that  love-making would lose something of its greatest charm if he were  driven there for a mate.  The time seemed ripe for stringent measures,  and the Cardinal was ready to take them; but how could he stringently  urge a little mate that would not come on his imploring invitations?  He listlessly pecked at the berries and flung abroad an inquiring  \"Chip!\" With just an atom of hope, he frequently mounted to his  choir-loft and issued an order that savoured far more of a plea, \"Come  here! Come here!\" and then, leaning, he listened intently to the voice  of the river, lest he fail to catch the faintest responsive \"Chook!\" it  might bear.    He could hear the sniffling of carp wallowing beside the bank.  A big  pickerel slashed around, breakfasting on minnows.  Opposite the sumac,  the black bass, with gamy spring, snapped up, before it struck the  water, every luckless, honey-laden insect that fell from the feast of  sweets in a blossom-whitened wild crab.  The sharp bark of the red  squirrel and the low of cattle, lazily chewing their cuds among the  willows, came to him.  The hammering of a woodpecker on a dead  sycamore, a little above him, rolled to his straining ears like a drum  beat.    The Cardinal hated the woodpecker more than he disliked the dove.    It was only foolishly effusive, but the woodpecker was a veritable  Bluebeard.  The Cardinal longed to pull the feathers from his back  until it was as red as his head, for the woodpecker had dressed his  suit in finest style, and with dulcet tones and melting tenderness had  gone acourting.  Sweet as the dove's had been his wooing, and one more  pang the lonely Cardinal had suffered at being forced to witness his  felicity; yet scarcely had his plump, amiable little mate consented to  his caresses and approved the sycamore, before he turned on her, pecked  her severely, and pulled a tuft of plumage from her breast.  There was  not the least excuse for this tyrannical action; and the sight filled  the Cardinal with rage.  He fully expected to see Madam Woodpecker  divorce herself and flee her new home, and he most earnestly hoped that  she would; but she did no such thing.  She meekly flattened her  feathers, hurried work in a lively manner, and tried in every way to  anticipate and avert her mate's displeasure.  Under this treatment he  grew more abusive, and now Madam Woodpecker dodged every time she came  within his reach.  It made the Cardinal feel so vengeful that he longed  to go up and drum the sycamore with the woodpecker's head until he  taught him how to treat his mate properly.    There was plently of lark music rolling with the river, and that  morning brought the first liquid golden notes of the orioles.  They had  arrived at dawn, and were overjoyed with their homecoming, for they  were darting from bank to bank singing exquisitely on wing.  There  seemed no end to the bird voices that floated with the river, and yet  there was no beginning to the one voice for which the Cardinal waited  with passionate longing.    The oriole's singing was so inspiring that it tempted the Cardinal to  another effort, and perching where he gleamed crimson and black against  the April sky, he tested his voice, and when sure of his tones, he  entreatingly called: \"Come here! Come here!\"    Just then he saw her!  She came daintily over the earth, soft as down  before the wind, a rosy flush suffusing her plumage, a coral beak, her  very feet pink--the shyest, most timid little thing alive.  Her bright  eyes were popping with fear, and down there among the ferns, anemones  and last year's dried leaves, she tilted her sleek crested head and  peered at him with frightened wonder and silent helplessness.    It was for this the Cardinal had waited, hoped, and planned for many  days.  He had rehearsed what he conceived to be every point of the  situation, and yet he was not prepared for the thing that suddenly  happened to him.  He had expected to reject many applicants before he  selected one to match his charms; but instantly this shy little  creature, slipping along near earth, taking a surreptitious peep at  him, made him feel a very small bird, and he certainly never"]]]
