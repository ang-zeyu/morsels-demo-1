The great complaint, the never-ending subject of comparison and  lamentation among ladies, is the utter ignorance and inefficiency of  their female servants. As soon as a ship comes in it is besieged with  people who want servants, but it is very rare to get one who knows how  to do anything as it ought to be done. Their lack of all knowledge of  the commonest domestic duties is most surprising, and makes one wonder  who in England did the necessary things of daily cottage life for them,  for they appear to have done nothing for themselves hitherto. As for a  woman knowing how to cook, that seems the very last accomplishment they  acquire; a girl will come to you as a housemaid at 25 pounds per annum,  and you will find that she literally does not know how to hold her  broom, and has never handled a duster. When you ask a nurse her  qualifications for the care of perhaps two or three young children, you  may find, on close cross-examination, that she can recollect having  once or twice \"held mother's baby,\" and that she is very firm in  her determination that \"you'll keep baby yourself o' nights; mem!\" A  perfectly inexperienced girl of this sort will ask, and get, 30 pounds  or 35 pounds per annum, a cook from 35 pounds to 40 pounds; and when  they go \"up country,\" they hint plainly they shall not stay long with  you, and ask higher wages, stipulating with great exactness how they are  to be conveyed free of all expense to and from their place.    Then, on the other hand, I must say they work desperately hard, and very  cheerfully: I am amazed how few servants are kept even in the large and  better class of houses. As a general rule, they, appear willing enough  to learn, and I hear no complaints of dishonesty or immorality, though  many moans are made of the rapidity with which a nice tidy young woman  is snapped up as a wife; but that is a complaint no one can sympathise  with. On most stations a married couple is kept; the man either to act  as shepherd, or to work in the garden and look after the cows, and  the woman is supposed to attend to the indoor comforts of the wretched  bachelor-master: but she generally requires to be taught how to bake a  loaf of bread, and boil a potato, as well as how to cook mutton in the  simplest form. In her own cottage at home, who did all these things for  her? These incapables are generally perfectly helpless and awkward at  the wash-tub; no one seems to expect servants to know their business,  and it is very fortunate if they show any capability of learning.    I must end my long letter by telling you a little story of my own  personal experience in the odd ways of these girls. The housemaid at the  boarding-house where we have stayed since we left Heathstock is a fat,  sonsy, good-natured girl, perfectly ignorant and stupid, but she has not  been long in the colony, and seems willing to learn. She came to me the  other day, and, without the least circumlocution or hesitation, asked  me if I would lend her my riding-habit as a pattern to give the tailor;  adding that she wanted my best and newest. As soon as I could speak  for amazement, I naturally asked why; she said she had been given a  riding-horse, that she had loaned a saddle, and bought a hat, so now she  had nothing on her mind except the habit; and further added, that she  intended to leave her situation the day before the races, and that it  was \"her fixed intent\" to appear on horseback each day, and all day  long, at these said races. I inquired if she knew how to ride? No;  she had never mounted any animal in her life. I suggested that she had  better take some lessons before her appearance in public; but she said  her mistress did not like to spare her to \"practise,\" and she stuck  steadily to her point of wanting my habit as a pattern. I could not lend  it to her, fortunately, for it had been sent up to the station with my  saddle, etc.; so had she been killed, as I thought not at all unlikely,  at least my conscience would not have reproached me for aiding and  abetting her equestrian freak. I inquired from every one who went to the  races if they saw or heard of any accident to a woman on horseback, and  I most anxiously watched the newspapers to see if they contained any  notice of the sort, but as there has been no mention of any catastrophe,  I suppose she has escaped safely. Her horse must have been quieter and  better broken than they generally are. F---- says that probably it was a  very old \"station screw.\" I trust so, for her sake!          Letter VII: A young colonist.--the town and its neighbourhood.      Christchurch, March 1866. I must begin my letter this mail with a piece  of domestic news, and tell you of the appearance of your small nephew,  now three weeks old. The youth seems inclined to adapt himself to  circumstances, and to be as sturdy and independent as colonial children  generally are. All my new friends and neighbours proved most kind and  friendly, and were full of good offices. Once I happened to say that I  did not like the food as it was cooked at the boarding-house; and the  next day, and for many days after, all sorts of dainties were sent to  me, prepared by hands which were as skilful on the piano, or with a  pencil, as they were in handling a saucepan. New books were lent to me,  and I was never allowed to be without a beautiful bouquet. One young  lady used constantly to walk in to town, some two or three miles along a  hot and dusty road, laden with flowers for me, just because she saw how  thoroughly I enjoyed her roses and carnations. Was it not good of her?    Christchurch has relapsed into the quietude, to call it by no harsher  name. The shearing is finished all over the country, and the \"squatters\"  (as owners of sheep-stations are called) have returned to their stations  to vegetate, or work, as their tastes and circumstances may dictate.  Very few people live in the town except the tradespeople; the  professional men prefer little villas two or three miles off. These  houses stand in grounds of their own, and form a very pretty approach to  Christchurch, extending a few miles on all sides: There are large trees  bordering most of the streets, which give a very necessary shade in  summer; they are nearly all English sorts, and have only been planted  within a few years. Poplars, willows, and the blue gum grow quickest,  are least affected by the high winds, and are therefore the most  popular. The banks of the pretty little river Avon, upon which  Christchurch is built, are thickly fringed with weeping willows,  interspersed with a few other trees, and with clumps of tohi, which is  exactly like the Pampas grass you know so well in English shrubberies.  I don't think I have ever told you that it has been found necessary here  to legislate against water-cress. It was introduced a few years since,  and has spread so rapidly as to become a perfect nuisance, choking every  ditch in the neighbourhood of Christchurch, blocking up mill-streams,  causing meadows to be flooded, and doing all kinds of mischief.    Towards Riccarton, about four miles out of town, the Avon shows like a  slender stream a few inches wide, moving sluggishly between thick beds  of water-cress, which at this time of year are a mass of white blossom.  It looks so perfectly solid that whenever I am at Ilam, an insane desire  to step on it comes over me, much to F----'s alarm, who says he is  afraid to let me out of his sight, lest I should attempt to do so.  I have only seen one native \"bush\" or forest yet, and that is at  Riccarton. This patch of tall, gaunt pines serves as a landmark for  miles. Riccarton is one of the oldest farms in the colony, and I am told  it possesses a beautiful garden. I can only see the gable-end of a house  peeping out from among the trees as I pass. This bush is most carefully  preserved, but I believe that every high wind injures it.    Christchurch is very prettily situated; for although it stands on a  perfectly flat plain, towards the sea there are the Port Hills, and the  town itself is picturesque, owing to the quantities of trees and the  irregular form of the wooden houses; and as a background we have  the most magnificent chain of mountains--the back-bone of the  island--running from north to south, the highest peaks nearly always  covered with snow, even after such a hot summer as this has been. The  climate is now delicious, answering in time of year to your September;  but we have far more enjoyable weather than your autumns can boast of.  If the atmosphere were no older than the date of the settlement of the  colony, it could not feel more _youthful_, it is so light and bright,  and exhilarating! The one drawback, and the only one, is the north-west  wind; and the worst of it is, that it blows very often from this  point. However, I am assured that I have not yet seen either a \"howling  nor'-wester,\" nor its exact antithesis, \"a sutherly buster.\"    We have lately been deprived of the amusement of going to see our house  during the process of cutting it out, as it has passed that stage, and  has been packed on drays and sent to the station, with two or three  men to put it up. It was preceded by two dray-loads of small rough-hewn  stone piles, which are first let into the ground six or eight feet  apart: the foundation joists rest on these, so as just to keep the  flooring from touching the earth. I did not like this plan (which is the  usual one) at all, as it seemed to me so insecure for the house to  rest only on these stones. I told the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#7)"],[1,"unmercifully till her cries brought me on the scene.  I tore the whip  from his hands, seized him by the scruff and flung him on a heap of  potato sacks, where he lay pouring out abuse and shaking with rage.  Then I spoke my mind.  I told him that if anything of the sort happened  again I would report it at once to Mr Colles at Durban.  I added that  before making my report I would beat him within an inch of his degraded  life.  After a time he apologized, but I could see that thenceforth he  regarded me with deadly hatred.    There was another thing I noticed about Mr Japp. He might brag about his  knowledge of how to deal with natives, but to my mind his methods were a  disgrace to a white man. Zeeta came in for oaths and blows, but there  were other Kaffirs whom he treated with a sort of cringing friendliness.  A big black fellow would swagger into the shop, and be received by Japp  as if he were his long-lost brother. The two would collogue for hours;  and though at first I did not understand the tongue, I could see that it  was the white man who fawned and the black man who bullied. Once when  Japp was away one of these fellows came into the store as if it belonged  to him, but he went out quicker than he entered. Japp complained  afterwards of my behaviour. ''Mwanga is a good friend of mine,' he said,  'and brings us a lot of business. I'll thank you to be civil to him the  next time.' I replied very shortly that 'Mwanga or anybody else who did  not mend his manners would feel the weight of my boot.        The thing went on, and I am not sure that he did not give the Kaffirs  drink on the sly.  At any rate, I have seen some very drunk natives on  the road between the locations and Blaauwildebeestefontein, and some of  them I recognized as Japp's friends.  I discussed the matter with Mr  Wardlaw, who said, 'I believe the old villain has got some sort of  black secret, and the natives know it, and have got a pull on him.'  And I was inclined to think he was right.      By-and-by I began to feel the lack of company, for Wardlaw was so full  of his books that he was of little use as a companion. So I resolved to  acquire a dog, and bought one from a prospector, who was stony-broke  and would have sold his soul for a drink.  It was an enormous Boer  hunting-dog, a mongrel in whose blood ran mastiff and bulldog and  foxhound, and Heaven knows what beside.  In colour it was a kind of  brindled red, and the hair on its back grew against the lie of the rest  of its coat.  Some one had told me, or I may have read it, that a back  like this meant that a dog would face anything mortal, even to a  charging lion, and it was this feature which first caught my fancy.  The price I paid was ten shillings and a pair of boots, which I got at  cost price from stock, and the owner departed with injunctions to me to  beware of the brute's temper.  Colin--for so I named him--began his  career with me by taking the seat out of my breeches and frightening Mr  Wardlaw into a tree.  It took me a stubborn battle of a fortnight to  break his vice, and my left arm to-day bears witness to the struggle.  After that he became a second shadow, and woe betide the man who had  dared to raise his hand to Colin's master.  Japp declared that the dog  was a devil, and Colin repaid the compliment with a hearty dislike.    With Colin, I now took to spending some of my ample leisure in  exploring the fastnesses of the Berg.  I had brought out a shot-gun of  my own, and I borrowed a cheap Mauser sporting rifle from the store.  I  had been born with a good eye and a steady hand, and very soon I became  a fair shot with a gun and, I believe, a really fine shot with the  rifle.  The sides of the Berg were full of quail and partridge and bush  pheasant, and on the grassy plateau there was abundance of a bird not  unlike our own blackcock, which the Dutch called _korhaan_. But the great  sport was to stalk bush-buck in the thickets, which is a game in which  the hunter is at small advantage.  I have been knocked down by a  wounded bush-buck ram, and but for Colin might have been badly damaged.  Once, in a kloof not far from the Letaba, I killed a fine leopard,  bringing him down with a single shot from a rocky shelf almost on the  top of Colin.  His skin lies by my fireside as I write this tale.  But  it was during the days I could spare for an expedition into the plains  that I proved the great qualities of my dog.  There we had nobler game  to follow--wildebeest and hartebeest, impala, and now and then a  koodoo.  At first I was a complete duffer, and shamed myself in Colin's  eyes.  But by-and-by I learned something of veld-craft: I learned how  to follow spoor, how to allow for the wind, and stalk under cover.  Then, when a shot had crippled the beast, Colin was on its track like a  flash to pull it down.  The dog had the nose of a retriever, the speed  of a greyhound, and the strength of a bull-terrier.  I blessed the day  when the wandering prospector had passed the store.    Colin slept at night at the foot of my bed, and it was he who led me to  make an important discovery.  For I now became aware that I was being  subjected to constant espionage.  It may have been going on from the  start, but it was not till my third month at Blaauwildebeestefontein  that I found it out.  One night I was going to bed, when suddenly the  bristles rose on the dog's back and he barked uneasily at the window.  I had been standing in the shadow, and as I stepped to the window to  look out I saw a black face disappear below the palisade of the  backyard.  The incident was trifling, but it put me on my guard.  The  next night I looked, but saw nothing.  The third night I looked, and  caught a glimpse of a face almost pressed to the pane.  Thereafter I  put up the shutters after dark, and shifted my bed to a part of the  room out of line with the window.    It was the same out of doors.  I would suddenly be conscious, as I  walked on the road, that I was being watched.  If I made as if to walk  into the roadside bush there would be a faint rustling, which told that  the watcher had retired.  The stalking was brilliantly done, for I  never caught a glimpse of one of the stalkers.  Wherever I went--on the  road, on the meadows of the plateau, or on the rugged sides of the  Berg--it was the same.  I had silent followers, who betrayed themselves  now and then by the crackling of a branch, and eyes were always looking  at me which I could not see.  Only when I went down to the plains did  the espionage cease.  This thing annoyed Colin desperately, and his  walks abroad were one continuous growl. Once, in spite of my efforts,  he dashed into the thicket, and a squeal of pain followed.  He had got  somebody by the leg, and there was blood on the grass.    Since I came to Blaauwildebeestefontein I had forgotten the mystery I  had set out to track in the excitement of a new life and my sordid  contest with Japp.  But now this espionage brought back my old  preoccupation.  I was being watched because some person or persons  thought that I was dangerous. My suspicions fastened on Japp, but I  soon gave up that clue. It was my presence in the store that was a  danger to him, not my wanderings about the countryside.  It might be  that he had engineered the espionage so as to drive me out of the place  in sheer annoyance; but I flattered myself that Mr Japp knew me too  well to imagine that such a game was likely to succeed.    The mischief was that I could not make out who the trackers were.  I  had visited all the surrounding locations, and was on good enough terms  with all the chiefs.  There was 'Mpefu, a dingy old fellow who had  spent a good deal of his life in a Boer gaol before the war.  There was  a mission station at his place, and his people seemed to me to be well  behaved and prosperous. Majinje was a chieftainess, a little girl whom  nobody was allowed to see.  Her location was a miserable affair, and  her tribe was yearly shrinking in numbers.  Then there was Magata  farther north among the mountains.  He had no quarrel with me, for he  used to give me a meal when I went out hunting in that direction; and  once he turned out a hundred of his young men, and I had a great battue  of wild dogs.  Sikitola, the biggest of all, lived some distance out in  the flats.  I knew less about him; but if his men were the trackers,  they must have spent most of their days a weary way from their kraal.  The Kaffirs in the huts at Blaauwildebeestefontein were mostly  Christians, and quiet, decent fellows, who farmed their little gardens,  and certainly preferred me to Japp.  I thought at one time of riding  into Pietersdorp to consult the Native Commissioner.  But I discovered  that the old man, who knew the country, was gone, and that his  successor was a young fellow from Rhodesia, who knew nothing about  anything.  Besides, the natives round Blaauwildebeestefontein were well  conducted, and received few official visitations.  Now and then a  couple of Zulu policemen passed in pursuit of some minor malefactor,  and the collector came for the hut-tax; but we gave the Government  little work, and they did not trouble their heads about us.    As I have said, the clues I had brought out with me to  Blaauwildebeestefontein began to occupy my mind again; and the more I  thought of the business the keener I grew.  I used to amuse myself with  setting out my various bits of knowledge. There was first of all the  Rev. John Laputa, his doings on the Kirkcaple shore, his talk with  Henriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, and his strange behaviour at  Durban. Then there was what Colles had told me about the place being  queer, how nobody would stay long either in the store or the  schoolhouse.  Then there was my talk with Aitken at Lourenco Marques,  and his story of a great wizard in the neighbourhood to whom all  Kaffirs made pilgrimages, and the suspicion of a diamond pipe.
