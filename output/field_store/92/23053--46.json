The men were not exempt from a shameful vice, which we might have  believed less common in this county than among the peoples of the  East.[100] The women united an extraordinary beauty with remarkable  courage and great physical force.[101]    The Gauls, according to the tradition preserved by the Druids, boasted  of being descended from the god of the earth, or from Pluto (_Dis_),  according to the expression of Caesar.[102] It was for this reason that  they took night for their starting-point in all their divisions of time.  Among their other customs, they had one which was singular: they  considered it as a thing unbecoming to appear in public with their  children, until the latter had reached the age for carrying arms.[103]    When he married, the man took from his fortune a part equal to the dowry  of the wife. This sum, placed as a common fund, was allowed to  accumulate with interest, and the whole reverted to the survivor. The  husband had the right of life and death over his wife and children.[104]  When the decease of a man of wealth excited any suspicion, his wives, as  well as his slaves, were put to the torture, and burnt if they were  found guilty.    The extravagance of their funerals presented a contrast to the  simplicity of their life. All that the defunct had cherished during his  life, was thrown into the flames after his death; and even, before the  Roman conquest, they joined with it his favourite slaves and  clients.[105]    In the time of Caesar, the greater part of the peoples of Gaul were armed  with long iron swords, two-edged ([Greek: spathe]), sheathed in  scabbards similarly of iron, suspended to the side by chains. These  swords were generally made to strike with the edge rather than to  stab.[106] The Gauls had also spears, the iron of which, very long and  very broad, presented sometimes an undulated form (_materis_,  [Greek: saunion]).[107] They also made use of light javelins without  _amentum_,[108] of the bow, and of the sling. Their helmets were of  metal, more or less precious, ornamented with the horns of animals, and  with a crest representing some figures of birds or savage beasts, the  whole surmounted by a high and bushy tuft of feathers.[109] They carried  a great buckler, a breastplate of iron or bronze, or a coat of mail--the  latter a Gaulish invention.[110] The Leuci and the Remi were celebrated  for throwing the javelin.[111] The Lingones had party-coloured  breastplates.[112] The Gaulish cavalry was superior to the  infantry;[113] it was composed of the nobles, followed by their  clients;[114] yet the Aquitanians, celebrated for their agility, enjoyed  a certain reputation as good infantry.[115] In general, the Gauls were  very ready at imitating the tactics of their enemies.[116] The habit of  working mines gave them a remarkable dexterity in all underground  operations, applicable to the attack and defence of fortified  posts.[117] Their armies dragged after them a multitude of wagons and  baggage, even in the less important expeditions.[118]    Although they had reached, especially in the south of Gaul, a tolerably  advanced degree of civilisation, they preserved very barbarous customs:  they killed their prisoners. \"When their army is ranged in battle,\" says  Diodorus, \"some of them are often seen advancing from the ranks to  challenge the bravest of their enemies to single combat. If their  challenge is accepted, they chaunt a war-song, in which they boast of  the great deeds of their forefathers, exalting their own valour and  insulting their adversary. After the victory, they cut off their enemy's  head, hang it to their horse's neck, and carry it off with songs of  triumph. They keep these hideous trophies in their house, and the  highest nobles preserve them with great care, bathed with oil of cedar,  in coffers, which they show with pride to their guests.\"[119]    When a great danger threatened the country, the chiefs convoked an armed  council, to which the men were bound to repair, at the place and day  indicated, to deliberate. The law required that the man who arrived last  should be massacred without pity before the eyes of the assembly. As a  means of intercommunication, men were placed at certain intervals  through the country, and these, repeating the cry from one to another,  transmitted rapidly news of importance to great distances. They often,  also, stopped travellers on the roads, and compelled them to answer  their questions.[120]    The Gauls were very superstitious.[121] Persuaded that in the eyes of  the gods the life of a man can only be redeemed by that of his fellow,  they made a vow, in diseases and dangers, to immolate human beings by  the ministry of the Druids. These sacrifices had even a public  character.[122] They sometimes constructed human figures of osier of  colossal magnitude, which they filled with living men; to these they set  fire, and the victims perished in the flames. These victims were  generally taken from among the criminals, as being more agreeable to  the gods; but if there were no criminals to be had, the innocent  themselves were sacrificed.    Caesar, who, according to the custom of his countrymen, gave to the  divinities of foreign peoples the names of those of Rome, tells us that  the Gauls honoured Mercury above all others. They raised statues to him,  regarded him as the inventor of the arts, the guide of travellers, and  the protector of commerce.[123] They also offered worship to divinities  which the \"Commentaries\" assimilate to Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and  Minerva, without informing us of their Celtic names. From Lucan,[124] we  learn the names of three Gaulish divinities, Teutates (in whom, no  doubt, we must recognise the Mercury of the \"Commentaries\"), Hesus or  Esus, and Taranis. Caesar makes the remark that the Gauls had pretty much  the same ideas with regard to their gods as other nations. Apollo cured  the sick, Minerva taught the elements of the arts, Jupiter was the  master of heaven, Mars the arbiter of war. Often, before fighting, they  made a vow to consecrate to this god the spoils of the enemy, and, after  the victory, they put to death all their prisoners. The rest of the  booty was piled up in the consecrated places, and nobody would be so  impious as to take anything away from it. The Gauls rendered also, as we  learn from inscriptions and passages in different authors, worship to  rivers, fountains, trees, and forests: they adored the Rhine as a god,  and made a goddess of the Ardenne.[125]      [Sidenote: Institutions]    IV. There were in Gaul, says Caesar, only two classes who enjoyed public  consideration and honours,[126] the Druids and the knights. As to the  people, deprived of all rights, oppressed with debts, crushed with  taxes, exposed to the violences of the great, their condition was little  better than that of slaves. The Druids, ministers of religion, presided  over the sacrifices, and preserved the deposit of religious doctrines.  The youth, greedy of instruction, pressed around them. The dispensers of  rewards and punishments, they were the judges of almost all disputes,  public or private. To private individuals, or even to magistrates, who  rebelled against their decisions, they interdicted the sacrifices, a  sort of excommunication which sequestrated from society those who were  struck by it, placed them in the rank of criminals, removed them from  all honours, and deprived them even of the protection of the law. The  Druids had a single head, and the power of this head was absolute. At  his death, the next in dignity succeeded him; if there were several with  equal titles, these priests had recourse to election, and sometimes even  to a decision by force of arms. They assembled every year in the country  of the Carnutes, in a consecrated place, there to judge disputes. Their  doctrine, it was said, came from the isle of Britain, where, in the time  of Caesar, they still went to draw it as at its source.[127]    The Druids were exempt from military service and from taxes.[128] These  privileges drew many disciples, whose novitiate, which lasted sometimes  twenty years, consisted in learning by heart a great number of verses  containing their religious precepts. It was forbidden to transcribe  them. This custom had the double object of preventing the divulgation of  their doctrine and of exercising the memory. Their principal dogma was  the immortality of the soul and its transmigration into other bodies. A  belief which banished the fear of death appeared to them fitted to  excite courage. They explained also the movement of the planets, the  greatness of the universe, the laws of nature, and the omnipotence of  the immortal gods. \"We may conceive,\" says the eminent author of the  _Histoire des Gaulois_, \"what despotism must have been exercised over a  superstitious nation by this caste of men, depositaries of all  knowledge, authors and interpreters of all law, divine or human,  remunerators, judges, and executioners.\"[129]    The knights, when required by the necessities of war, and that happened  almost yearly, were all bound to take up arms. Each, according to his  birth and fortune, was accompanied by a greater or less number of  attendants or clients. Those who were called _ambacti_[130] performed in  war the part of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#7)"],[1," the  flesh is very exhausted. Nevertheless, not for a moment do our spirits  flag; on the contrary, the worse things grow the more cheerful do we  become, the more determined to make the best of things. It is strange  that all the years we worked hard to amuse ourselves at home not one  brought an eighth of the satisfaction of _this_.    There is a wonderful dearth of utensils, though the store grows larger  daily. It is no infrequent occurrence to have to sally out to the  nearest chemist to buy air cushions, eye baths, etc., as they are  required.    Night, and the wards are full. Another train disgorges its burden. The  stretcher cases have to remain on stretchers. The walking cases are  huddled round the stove, extended on the concrete, their blood-stained,  bug-ridden greatcoats for coverings.    Without, for a moment the rain has ceased, and in the clear night the  moon smiles peacefully over the silver, gleaming sea.    What a contrast to the scene within! The restless figures of the  wounded--the busy nurses.    Everyone is exhausted, for it is an almost superhuman task for seven  women to tackle by day and by night; but they say the Army Nursing  Service will be here in sufficient numbers soon. The lady doctors have  been invaluable, their zeal unflagging. They are splendid operators,  and in the midst of the worst rushes never careless. Besides their work  here they spend much time at the \"Women's Hospital\" at a chateau some  three miles out of Boulogne, where everything is run by volunteer women  workers, who act as doctors, nurses, orderlies and quartermasters.    The theatre looks quite smart, with the large sterilisers that have  been installed and the operating table. What tales those whitewashed  walls could tell!    Will those who are knitting away at home ever realise the value of  their own handiwork, I wonder?    If they could but see the eager faces of the men as the meagre stores  are issued, and they receive those ill-fitting coats, and socks, and  card-board-footed shoes (the nightingales they one and all disdain);  could they for a single moment glance at the contented expression of  the \"movable cases\" as they wriggle out of their creeping shirts, so  torn, so stiff with congealed blood and stained with Flanders mud,  into garments that are both soft and warm, all those hours of patient  knitting would be well rewarded; they would know they are not labouring  in vain.    In spite of the so-called \"Red Cross Store Room\" that is being  replenished daily by stock drawn from all sources, of course there  aren't enough things to go round, and although we grouse at the wise  quartermaster's inquiries as to whether each article we need is an  imperative necessity or not, in our heart of hearts we know him to be  in the right.     [Illustration: EXTEMPORISED OPERATING THEATRE AT A CLEARING STATION   \"The theatre looks quite smart with the huge sterilisers that have been   installed and the operating table\"]    A strange thing happened to-day. A man came in with a badly shattered  forearm. I dressed it myself, and can vouch for the fact that in  other respects he seemed fit enough.    Not long afterwards one of his companions disengaged himself from the  group by the stove and came to me, saying: \"Sister, that man has gone  blind suddenly.\"    I remarked it must be nonsense, and told him to go to sleep.  Nevertheless, on passing a light before the other man's eyes there  was never a flicker. He was blind, as the medical officer can vouch;  whether it is temporary or not we shall never know, for the cases pass  through so quickly.      _November 2nd._ Someone has been asked to volunteer to run the military  baths. I, being the one whose work in hospital must be of least value,  naturally did so, and was accepted.      _November 3rd._ Most of the men are very subdued, and either loath to  talk of what they have been through or ultra-full of reminiscences,  many of which have to be taken with a grain of salt.    A large percentage of them stammer or have developed a nervous  impediment in their speech, owing, no doubt, to the strain of the past  months; and this is very often the case in Territorial regiments, whose  members were accustomed to a more or less easy life in peace time.    Quite a number of the London Scottish--whose \"charge\" has been so  boomed by the daily papers as a proof of the efficiency of the  Territorial Army--are coming down now. They are very annoyed and very  ashamed of the fuss that has been made of them.    \"We only did what is done by one regiment or another every day,\" they  said, \"and now we hardly like to show our faces for the ridicule that  must be cast upon us by the Regulars, who have seen ten times as much  fighting and never been mentioned at all.\"    The \"dum-dum\" lie is no lie at all. Anyone who has seen the strangely  mutilated limbs can vouch for that. In one case the bullet passed clean  through one leg and exploded in the other. Bah! the smell of the gas  gangrene--shall we ever forget it?    We hear many tales about the Germans from the men. Devoid of honour,  they train machine-guns on ambulances, and accredit us with the same  devilish tricks. One French civilian ambulance unit was totally  destroyed a few days back, and wounded, surgeons, stretcher-bearers and  nurses alike were blown to atoms.      _November 7th._ I am now installed as \"Lady Superintendent of Military  Baths,\" an entirely new post!    The scene of my activities is the public baths in the Rue des  Vieillards, that have been rented from the old proprietress. With six  orderlies to do the rough work--the washing of towels, the cleaning of  the twenty baths, and my own spacious office in which to do the men's  dressings--things are cheerful enough.    About 100 men come through each day--the convalescents in the morning,  so that the whole forenoon is taken up with dressings.    The difficulties at first were many, a fact which considerably enhanced  the joy of the work.    1. To get the place clean was a veritable _chef-d'oeuvre_.    2. Drawing things from the Ordnance is no easy matter. One must not buy  what may be drawn; and as I have no notion of what can be drawn there  is often considerable delay.    3. Persuading the orderlies that water for dressings must be boiled,  and not lukewarm, is likewise far from easy.    The days are no longer so strenuous. I arrive at eight to see that the  men are getting on with their work, cut up dressings, leave out and  mark towels until ten o'clock, when the convalescents begin to arrive.    By 3.30 I am able to go down to the clearing station to write letters  for the helpless.    To-day a man who was brought in with a badly fractured pelvis dictated  one to his brother. It ran:     \"DEAR GEORGE,--After going through all the big battles of Mons, the   Marne and the Aisne, I am sad to say I've got hit at last, but hope   soon to be home with you all. I'm glad to know you've joined to be a   soldier, and hope soon to hear you're helping in the fight.\"    \"It isn't true, Sister,\" he added; \"but perhaps it will help him  through, poor fellow--if I die!\"    Needless to say, none of the hospital personnel have time to sandwich  letter-writing for the men in between their medical work, and civilian  help is welcome in this matter.    No one who has not seen the intricacies of the office work of a large  military hospital can have the least conception what an amount of  forethought, what a number of clerks are involved. The distribution  of the wounded into the different wards, the notification and  specification of each case--each is an art in itself. Whilst in the  quartermaster's domain the drawing of rations for an elastic number of  patients, ranging each meal from 50 to 400, is wellnigh stupendous.    And although we who know nothing of these matters have often laughed  at the theoretical red tape of the Army, there is no denying that, in  working order, it is a thing to be venerated rather than scoffed at.      _November 8th, On the Ramparts of Boulogne._ After the hush of the  unornamental cathedral the soft autumn breezes out here are refreshing.  Even in the well ventilated baths the pungent smell of segregated  humanity permeates. What a strange place is Boulogne now, the city of  hospitals, every hotel a hospital, every road thronged with troops and  nurses!    Yesterday I had a slight fracas with my corporal, a nice but utterly  untrained boy, who has a way of wandering into the office, cigarette  in mouth.    Now, there is no law in the Army, so far as I can make out, that  compels an orderly to pay the slightest respect toward a nurse. He must  stand at attention when addressed by a junior subaltern, but may loll  and smoke at his ease whilst taking a nursing sister's orders. Thus  it seems that from time immemorial a slight antagonism has reigned,  for the men are apt to take advantage of a woman, who, unless she have  infinite tact, often enough finds things hard.    However, after two cups of black coffee to give me the requisite  courage, I faced the little difficulty boldly. \"Corporal,\" I suggested,  \"it doesn't matter what you do outside, but I would rather you didn't  smoke in the office. You set the example to the others, who are  beginning to turn the office into a sort of smoking-room. Besides, it  isn't usual in the Service, is it?\"    There was an awkward silence, as the poor boy blushed and grunted. Then  I changed the subject, and think all will be well, for though surly in  manner he is most anxious to please.    One afternoon I was asked to go and speak to some prisoners at the  Imperial (No. ---- General Hospital), where Miss A---- is now working. A  young \"Freiwillige\" of 19 immediately inquired: \"What about Paris?\"    \"What do you mean?\" I asked, astonished.    \"When did we take it?\" was the somewhat surprising reply.    On the whole, in spite of the rigorous discipline that makes it  necessary for German officers"]]]
