they did tear me, and ceased             not:    19:035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with             their teeth.    19:035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their             destructions, my darling from the lions.    19:035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will             praise thee among much people.    19:035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:             neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a             cause.    19:035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters             against them that are quiet in the land.    19:035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,             aha, our eye hath seen it.    19:035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not             far from me.    19:035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,             my God and my Lord.    19:035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and             let them not rejoice over me.    19:035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let             them not say, We have swallowed him up.    19:035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that             rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and             dishonour that magnify themselves against me.    19:035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous             cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be             magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his             servant.    19:035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy             praise all the day long.    19:036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that             there is no fear of God before his eyes.    19:036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity             be found to be hateful.    19:036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left             off to be wise, and to do good.    19:036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way             that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.    19:036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness             reacheth unto the clouds.    19:036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments             are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.    19:036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the             children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.    19:036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy             house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy             pleasures.    19:036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we             see light.    19:036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and             thy righteousness to the upright in heart.    19:036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the             hand of the wicked remove me.    19:036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,             and shall not be able to rise.    19:037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious             against the workers of iniquity.    19:037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as             the green herb.    19:037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the             land, and verily thou shalt be fed.    19:037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the             desires of thine heart.    19:037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall             bring it to pass.    19:037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and             thy judgment as the noonday.    19:037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself             because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man             who bringeth wicked devices to pass.    19:037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any             wise to do evil.    19:037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the             LORD, they shall inherit the earth.    19:037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou             shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.    19:037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight             themselves in the abundance of peace.    19:037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him             with his teeth.    19:037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is             coming.    19:037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,             to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of             upright conversation.    19:037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows             shall be broken.    19:037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches             of many wicked.    19:037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD             upholdeth the righteous.    19:037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their             inheritance shall be for ever.    19:037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of             famine they shall be satisfied.    19:037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall             be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall             they consume away.    19:037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous             sheweth mercy, and giveth.    19:037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and             they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.    19:037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he             delighteth in his way.    19:037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the             LORD upholdeth him with his hand.    19:037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the             righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.    19:037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.    19:037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.    19:037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;             they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall             be cut off.    19:037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for             ever.    19:037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue             talketh of judgment.    19:037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall             slide.    19:037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.    19:037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when             he is judged.    19:037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to             inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see             it.    19:037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself             like a green bay tree.    19:037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,             but he could not be found.    19:037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of             that man is peace.    19:037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of             the wicked shall be cut off.    19:037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their             strength in the time of trouble.    19:037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall             deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they             trust in him.    19:038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy             hot displeasure.    19:038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me             sore.    19:038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;             neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.    19:038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy             burden they are too heavy for me.    19:038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.    19:038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the             day long.    19:038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is             no soundness in my flesh.    19:038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the             disquietness of my heart.    19:038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid             from thee.    19:038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of             mine eyes, it also is gone from me.    19:038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my             kinsmen stand afar off.    19:038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they             that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine             deceits all the day long.    19:038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that             openeth not his mouth.    19:038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are             no reproofs.    19:038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8020"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 20: Proverbs (#7)"],[1,"wife are a continual dropping.    20:019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent             wife is from the LORD.    20:019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall             suffer hunger.    20:019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he             that despiseth his ways shall die.    20:019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and             that which he hath given will he pay him again.    20:019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul             spare for his crying.    20:019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou             deliver him, yet thou must do it again.    20:019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be             wise in thy latter end.    20:019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the             counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.    20:019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better             than a liar.    20:019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it             shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.    20:019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so             much as bring it to his mouth again.    20:019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one             that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.    20:019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a             son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.    20:019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err             from the words of knowledge.    20:019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the             wicked devoureth iniquity.    20:019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back             of fools.    20:020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is             deceived thereby is not wise.    20:020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso             provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.    20:020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool             will be meddling.    20:020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore             shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.    20:020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of             understanding will draw it out.    20:020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a             faithful man who can find?    20:020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are             blessed after him.    20:020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away             all evil with his eyes.    20:020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my             sin?    20:020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike             abomination to the LORD.    20:020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,             and whether it be right.    20:020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even             both of them.    20:020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,             and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.    20:020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is             gone his way, then he boasteth.    20:020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of             knowledge are a precious jewel.    20:020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a             pledge of him for a strange woman.    20:020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth             shall be filled with gravel.    20:020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice             make war.    20:020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:             therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.    20:020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put             out in obscure darkness.    20:020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the             end thereof shall not be blessed.    20:020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,             and he shall save thee.    20:020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false             balance is not good.    20:020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand             his own way?    20:020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and             after vows to make enquiry.    20:020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over             them.    20:020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the             inward parts of the belly.    20:020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden             by mercy.    20:020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of             old men is the grey head.    20:020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the             inward parts of the belly.    20:021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of             water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.    20:021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD             pondereth the hearts.    20:021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than             sacrifice.    20:021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the             wicked, is sin.    20:021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but             of every one that is hasty only to want.    20:021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed             to and fro of them that seek death.    20:021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they             refuse to do judgment.    20:021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,             his work is right.    20:021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a             brawling woman in a wide house.    20:021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no             favour in his eyes.    20:021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and             when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.    20:021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:             but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.    20:021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall             cry himself, but shall not be heard.    20:021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom             strong wrath.    20:021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be             to the workers of iniquity.    20:021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall             remain in the congregation of the dead.    20:021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth             wine and oil shall not be rich.    20:021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the             transgressor for the upright.    20:021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a             contentious and an angry woman.    20:021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the             wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.    20:021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,             righteousness, and honour.    20:021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down             the strength of the confidence thereof.    20:021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from             troubles.    20:021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud             wrath.    20:021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse             to labour.    20:021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous             giveth and spareth not.    20:021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,             when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?    20:021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth             speaketh constantly.    20:021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he             directeth his way.    20:021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the             LORD.    20:021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is             of the LORD.    20:022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and             loving favour rather than silver and gold.    20:022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them             all.    20:022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the             simple pass on, and are punished.    20:022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,             and life.    20:022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth             keep his soul shall be far from them.    20:022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,             he will not depart from it.    20:022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to             the lender.    20:022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his             anger shall fail.    20:022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth             of his bread to the poor.    20:022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife             and reproach shall cease.    20:022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart,"]]]
