Yes, I made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that  gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation  --lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels,  and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty  generally; yes, and even some gold--but that was at the bank,  that is to say, the goldsmith's.  I dropped in there while Marco,  the son of Marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter  of a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold  piece.  They furnished it--that is, after they had chewed the piece,  and rung it on the counter, and tried acid on it, and asked me  where I got it, and who I was, and where I was from, and where  I was going to, and when I expected to get there, and perhaps  a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground,  I went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily;  told them I owned a dog, and his name was Watch, and my first wife  was a Free Will Baptist, and her grandfather was a Prohibitionist,  and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart  on the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a glorious  resurrection, and so on, and so on, and so on, till even that  hungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shade  put out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength,  and so he didn't give me any lip, but I noticed he took it out of  his underlings, which was a perfectly natural thing to do.  Yes,  they changed my twenty, but I judged it strained the bank a little,  which was a thing to be expected, for it was the same as walking  into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring  the boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you all  of a sudden.  He could do it, maybe; but at the same time he  would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much  money around in his pocket; which was probably this goldsmith's  thought, too; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing  after me with reverent admiration.    Our new money was not only handsomely circulating, but its language  was already glibly in use; that is to say, people had dropped  the names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worth  so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now.  It was very  gratifying.  We were progressing, that was sure.    I got to know several master mechanics, but about the most interesting  fellow among them was the blacksmith, Dowley.  He was a live man  and a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices,  and was doing a raging business.  In fact, he was getting rich,  hand over fist, and was vastly respected.  Marco was very proud of  having such a man for a friend.  He had taken me there ostensibly  to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his  charcoal, but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar  terms he was on with this great man.  Dowley and I fraternized  at once; I had had just such picked men, splendid fellows, under  me in the Colt Arms Factory.  I was bound to see more of him, so  I invited him to come out to Marco's Sunday, and dine with us.  Marco was appalled, and held his breath; and when the grandee  accepted, he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished  at the condescension.    Marco's joy was exuberant--but only for a moment; then he grew  thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell Dowley I should  have Dickon, the boss mason, and Smug, the boss wheelwright, out  there, too, the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he lost  his grip.  But I knew what was the matter with him; it was the  expense.  He saw ruin before him; he judged that his financial  days were numbered.  However, on our way to invite the others,  I said:    \"You must allow me to have these friends come; and you must also  allow me to pay the costs.\"    His face cleared, and he said with spirit:    \"But not all of it, not all of it.  Ye cannot well bear a burden  like to this alone.\"    I stopped him, and said:    \"Now let's understand each other on the spot, old friend.  I am  only a farm bailiff, it is true; but I am not poor, nevertheless.  I have been very fortunate this year--you would be astonished  to know how I have thriven.  I tell you the honest truth when I say  I could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never  care _that_ for the expense!\" and I snapped my fingers.  I could  see myself rise a foot at a time in Marco's estimation, and when  I fetched out those last words I was become a very tower for style  and altitude.  \"So you see, you must let me have my way.  You  can't contribute a cent to this orgy, that's _settled_.\"    \"It's grand and good of you--\"    \"No, it isn't.  You've opened your house to Jones and me in the  most generous way; Jones was remarking upon it to-day, just before  you came back from the village; for although he wouldn't be likely  to say such a thing to you--because Jones isn't a talker, and is  diffident in society--he has a good heart and a grateful, and  knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated; yes, you and  your wife have been very hospitable toward us--\"    \"Ah, brother, 'tis nothing--_such_ hospitality!\"    \"But it _is_ something; the best a man has, freely given, is always  something, and is as good as a prince can do, and ranks right  along beside it--for even a prince can but do his best.  And so  we'll shop around and get up this layout now, and don't you worry  about the expense.  I'm one of the worst spendthrifts that ever  was born.  Why, do you know, sometimes in a single week I spend  --but never mind about that--you'd never believe it anyway.\"    And so we went gadding along, dropping in here and there, pricing  things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now  and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of  shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes  had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged.  The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and  linsey-woolsey respectively, and resembled township maps, it being  made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township  by township, in the course of five or six years, until hardly a  hand's-breadth of the original garments was surviving and present.  Now I wanted to fit these people out with new suits, on account of  that swell company, and I didn't know just how to get at it  --with delicacy, until at last it struck me that as I had already  been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king, it would  be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial  sort; so I said:    \"And Marco, there's another thing which you must permit--out of  kindness for Jones--because you wouldn't want to offend him.  He was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, but  he is so diffident he couldn't venture it himself, and so he begged  me to buy some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis  and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from  him--you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing  --and so I said I would, and we would keep mum.  Well, his idea  was, a new outfit of clothes for you both--\"    \"Oh, it is wastefulness!  It may not be, brother, it may not be.  Consider the vastness of the sum--\"    \"Hang the vastness of the sum!  Try to keep quiet for a moment,  and see how it would seem; a body can't get in a word edgeways,  you talk so much.  You ought to cure that, Marco; it isn't good  form, you know, and it will grow on you if you don't check it.  Yes, we'll step in here now and price this man's stuff--and don't  forget to remember to not let on to Jones that you know he had  anything to do with it.  You can't think how curiously sensitive  and proud he is.  He's a farmer--pretty fairly well-to-do farmer  --an I'm his bailiff; _but_--the imagination of that man!  Why,  sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off, you'd  think he was one of the swells of the earth; and you might listen  to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer--especially if  he talked agriculture.  He _thinks_ he's a Sheol of a farmer; thinks  he's old Grayback from Wayback; but between you and me privately  he don't know as much about farming as he does about running  a kingdom--still, whatever he talks about, you want to drop your  underjaw and listen, the same as if you had never heard such  incredible wisdom in all your life before, and were afraid you  might die before you got enough of it.  That will please Jones.\"    It tickled Marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character;  but it also prepared him for accidents; and in my experience when  you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and  can't remember it more than about half the time, you can't take  too many precautions.    This was the best store we had come across yet; it had everything  in it, in small quantities, from anvils and drygoods all the way  down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry.  I concluded I would bunch  my whole invoice right here, and not go pricing around any more.  So I got rid of Marco, by sending him off to invite the mason and  the wheelwright, which left the field free to me.  For I never care  to do a thing in a quiet way; it's got to be theatrical or I don't  take any interest in it.  I showed up money enough, in a careless  way, to corral the shopkeeper's respect, and then I wrote down  a list of the things I wanted, and handed it to him to see if he  could read it.  He could, and was proud to show that he could.  He said he had been educated by a priest, and could both read  and write.  He ran it through, and remarked with satisfaction that  it was a pretty heavy bill.  Well, and so it was, for a little  concern like that.  I was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7248"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 7. (#7)"],[1,"  next thirteen centuries wouldn't see one that was worth the fourth  of it.  Yes, he tired me.  If he began to talk about the crops;  or about the recent weather; or about the condition of politics;  or about dogs, or cats, or morals, or theology--no matter what  --I sighed, for I knew what was coming; he was going to get out of it  a palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale.  Wherever we  halted where there was a crowd, he would give me a look which  said plainly: \"if that thing could be tried over again now, with  this kind of folk, you would see a different result.\"  Well, when  he was first sold, it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven  dollars; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying  I wished he had fetched a hundred.  The thing never got a chance  to die, for every day, at one place or another, possible purchasers  looked us over, and, as often as any other way, their comment on  the king was something like this:    \"Here's a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirty-dollar style.  Pity but style was marketable.\"    At last this sort of remark produced an evil result.  Our owner  was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be  mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king.  So he went  to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty.  I could have  given the man some valuable advice, but I didn't; you mustn't  volunteer advice to a slave-driver unless you want to damage  the cause you are arguing for.  I had found it a sufficiently  difficult job to reduce the king's style to a peasant's style,  even when he was a willing and anxious pupil; now then, to undertake  to reduce the king's style to a slave's style--and by force--go to!  it was a stately contract.  Never mind the details--it will save me  trouble to let you imagine them.  I will only remark that at the  end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club  and fist had done their work well; the king's body was a sight  to see--and to weep over; but his spirit?--why, it wasn't even  phased.  Even that dull clod of a slave-driver was able to see  that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man  till he dies; whose bones you can break, but whose manhood you  can't.  This man found that from his first effort down to his  latest, he couldn't ever come within reach of the king, but the  king was ready to plunge for him, and did it.  So he gave up  at last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired.  The fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was  a man; and when a man is a man, you can't knock it out of him.    We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth,  and suffering.  And what Englishman was the most interested in  the slavery question by that time?  His grace the king!  Yes; from  being the most indifferent, he was become the most interested.  He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever  heard talk.  And so I ventured to ask once more a question which  I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that  I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further.  Would he abolish slavery?    His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time;  I shouldn't ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity  was not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word  almost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it  ought to have been.    I was ready and willing to get free now; I hadn't wanted to get  free any sooner.  No, I cannot quite say that.  I had wanted to,  but I had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had  always dissuaded the king from them.  But now--ah, it was a new  atmosphere!  Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put  upon it now.  I set about a plan, and was straightway charmed  with it.  It would require time, yes, and patience, too, a great  deal of both.  One could invent quicker ways, and fully as sure  ones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none that  could be made so dramatic.  And so I was not going to give this  one up.  It might delay us months, but no matter, I would carry  it out or break something.    Now and then we had an adventure.  One night we were overtaken  by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making  for.  Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving  snow was so thick.  You couldn't see a thing, and we were soon  lost.  The slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin  before him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for they  drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor.  So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we  were.  The storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased.  By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were  dead, and others past moving and threatened with death.  Our  master was nearly beside himself.  He stirred up the living, and  made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation,  and he helped as well as he could with his whip.    Now came a diversion.  We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a  woman came running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung  herself into our midst and begged for protection.  A mob of people  came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a  witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease,  and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black  cat.  This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked  human, she was so battered and bloody.  The mob wanted to burn her.    Well, now, what do you suppose our master did?  When we closed  around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance.  He  said, burn her here, or they shouldn't have her at all.  Imagine  that!  They were willing.  They fastened her to a post; they  brought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch while  she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters  to her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business,  lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life  and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent  life of that poor harmless mother.  That was the sort of master we  had.  I took _his_ number.  That snow-storm cost him nine of his  flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for  many days together, he was so enraged over his loss.    We had adventures all along.  One day we ran into a procession.  And such a procession!  All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed  to be comprehended in it; and all drunk at that.  In the van was  a cart with a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young  girl of about eighteen suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her  breast in a passion of love every little while, and every little  while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down  upon it; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her,  happy and content, kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand,  which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart.    Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after  the cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing  snatches of foul song, skipping, dancing--a very holiday of  hellions, a sickening sight.  We had struck a suburb of London,  outside the walls, and this was a sample of one sort of London  society.  Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows.  A priest was in attendance, and he helped the girl climb up, and  said comforting words to her, and made the under-sheriff provide  a stool for her.  Then he stood there by her on the gallows, and  for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his  feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away  on every side occupying the vacancies far and near, and then began  to tell the story of the case.  And there was pity in his voice  --how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land!  I remember every detail of what he said, except the words he said  it in; and so I change it into my own words:    \"Law is intended to mete out justice.  Sometimes it fails. This  cannot be helped.  We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray  for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and  that his fellows may be few.  A law sends this poor young thing  to death--and it is right.  But another law had placed her where  she must commit her crime or starve with her child--and before God  that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death!    \"A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years,  was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips  were blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and  innocent hearts.  Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was  doing his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft,  his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering,  he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was  adding his mite to the wealth of the nation.  By consent of a  treacherous law, instant destruction fell upon this holy home and  swept it away!  That young husband was waylaid and impressed,  and sent to sea.  The wife knew nothing of it.  She sought him  everywhere, she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications  of her tears, the broken eloquence of her despair.  Weeks dragged  by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind going slowly to wreck  under the burden of her misery.  Little by little all her small  possessions went for food.  When she could no longer pay her rent,  they turned her out of doors.  She begged, while she had strength;  when she was starving at last, and her milk failing, she stole a  piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent,  thinking to sell it and save her child.  But she was seen by the  owner of the cloth.  She was put in jail and brought to trial.  "]]]
