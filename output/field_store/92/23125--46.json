THE subject and author of this Life-Sketch of a Pioneer is James  Stephens Brown, now (1900) in his seventy-second year, a resident of  Salt Lake City, Utah, his home less than a quarter of a mile from and  within the summer morning's shadow of the majestic Temple of the Lord  erected on that spot which he beheld a barren and desolate wilderness,  on his entrance into the valley of the Great Salt Lake, over half a  century ago. His life has been one of thrilling experiences--more than  ordinarily falls to the lot even of a pioneer settler in the Great  West--a life in which hardship and perils by sea and land, among dusky  savages and with white men, have contributed largely to the events  of his career; withal one in which he has had abundant occasion to  recognize and acknowledge the power and protecting care of an Almighty  Providence.    It is at the urgent request and advice of valued friends, familiar  to a considerable extent with my life and labors, that I place this  autobiography in form to be easily accessible to those desirous of  perusing it; and I am not unmindful of the fact that this simple  recital of events is not only of intense interest in numerous episodes  which it records, but is of historic value in being a plain and  truthful narrative of the personal experiences of a western pioneer.    I was born on Independence Day, July 4, 1828, in Davidson County, North  Carolina, U.S.A. My father was Daniel Brown; he was the youngest son  of his father's family, and was born in Rowan County, North Carolina,  June 30, 1804. My father's father was James Brown, a native of Rowan  County, North Carolina, 1757 being the year of his birth. His wife  was the widow of a Revolutionary War soldier named Emerson, who was  killed in the war for American independence, leaving his wife and  two children, Margaret and John Emerson. My grandfather James Brown  married the widow Emerson, who bore him nine children--three sons and  six daughters--Jane, Polly, Nancy, Susan, Patsy, William, Obedience,  James (captain of Company C, Mormon Battalion), and Daniel (my father);  her maiden name was Mary Williams. All the family had an excellent  reputation, being upright, thrifty, and good and industrious citizens.    With these introductory remarks, I will proceed to an account of my  boyhood's days. I was reared at the farming and stock business, also  at getting out saw timber and wood for cooperware. My parents had  moved from North Carolina to Brown County, Illinois, in the autumn of  1831, and had purchased an extensive tract of land. We were a large  family; the country was then wild and with very few inhabitants, and  the climate was unhealthy; so it was with great effort that father and  mother succeeded in making a home and gathering about them the comforts  of life.    We were frontier settlers, and while father had his pick of land, he  also had the hardships and privations of a new country to endure. There  were no churches or schoolhouses nearer than ten miles from our home,  and grist mills and blacksmith shops were equally distant. Thus the  family was reared without the advantage of schools, or of church-going  religious training. But we were thoroughly acquainted with border  life, with hunting, fishing, and all the sports indulged in by hardy  pioneers, and even learned to shake terribly from the ague, and burn  with fever spells, while we were well dosed with quinine and calomel,  and had enormous doctor's bills to pay.    In our operations we trained horses and cattle to work, stocked our own  plows, made our own harrows, rakes and forks, braided our own whips  from the pelts of wild beasts which we ourselves dressed, raised our  own honey, and made our own sugar, with some to sell. We had a good  sugar orchard, and plenty of wild fruits and nuts for the gathering. As  the first settlers of new countries are more or less subject to dangers  from outlaws, wild beasts, and savage men, we found it important to be  well armed, and on the alert day and night to defend life and liberty.    Thus we learned the use of firearms and the tomahawk. My father was  an expert with the old Kentucky rifle, and some of his boys were not  far behind him; he trained them always to shoot with a rising sight,  to keep cool, and always to have their powder dry and plenty of it. He  also taught us to tell the truth, and used to say: \"Be honest, stand up  for your rights, and fight for your country and friends.\"    In the year 1835, people began to settle in around us, and then the  circuit riders, as they were called--the ministers--commenced to call  around and hold meetings in private houses. There were Baptists,  Freewill Baptists, Methodists, Campbellites, and others. From 1836 to  1838 some small churches and schoolhouses were built, so that we began  to get spiritual food, such as it was; and also some schooling, with  the benefit of the hickory rod that always was kept \"in soak,\" so to  speak, and woe to the unruly student when it was called into service!    So far as the author is concerned, he managed to get along without the  rod the short time he was permitted to attend school. He was kept close  at work on the farm in summer, and in the winter months was engaged  getting out timber and hauling to market the farm products. Once his  feet were frozen so that he lost every nail from his toes. As to the  religious teachings of the time, there was a great deal of thundering  and thundering, but it failed to indicate any lightening of the  author's path, for he fished and hunted on the Sabbath day, just the  same.    Some time in the '30s we began to hear a little about false prophets, a  new religion, miracles, money-diggers, thieves, liars, miracle-workers,  deceivers, witches, speaking in tongues and interpretation of the same,  walking on the water, and visits from angels. As time went on, all  these things were combined to form a grand excuse for raising mobs to  expel the new Church from the borders of civilization. Then came news  of murder, rapine, house-burning, and destruction of towns and cities  in Missouri. There were great \"showers\" of stars in the firmament  about this time. On popular rumor, and from hearing only one side of  the story, almost everybody decided that such a previously unheard-of  people as the Mormons ought to be shot or burned at the stake. This was  the sentiment to be found on every hand.    As a culmination of these things came the tidings that the Missourians  had driven the Mormons from the state of Missouri into Illinois. A  little later, and a Latter-day Saint Elder named Jacob Pfoutz entered  the neighborhood of my Uncle James Brown's home, converted him, his  wife, and several of the neighbors. This Elder was brought down by my  uncle to see his two sisters, Aunts Polly and Nancy Brown.    Elder Pfoutz was given permission to preach in the schoolhouse about  three miles from my father's house. The news spread like a prairie fire  that the Mormons had come and would preach on Friday. I think this was  in the autumn of 1840. I was at my aunt's at the time, and decided to  go and hear the strange preacher. Like most of the people, I went out  of curiosity, more than anything else. I had just turned my twelfth  year, and had begun to take some interest in religion, going to every  meeting for which I could obtain permission from my parents, yet not  thinking for a moment but that all religions were right.    At the first meeting held by the Mormon, the house was pretty well  filled. Some who attended did so with the thought that after the  services were over they would tar and feather the Elder and ride him on  a rail, as such things had been indulged in in Missouri, and threats  had been made freely. Others were going to confound him, and still  others wanted to see the fun, as they said.    The preacher was a plain-spoken man of thirty-five to forty years old,  of German descent. He was plainly dressed, and without that urbane  polish which ministers usually have. When he began his discourse,  he raised up very calmly and deliberately and read from Matthew,  seventh chapter, verses fifteen to twenty. He spoke from that text  and corroborating passages, supporting his argument throughout by  scripture. At the conclusion of his address, some of the people said  they did not want to mob a man who preached like that, while others  \"sniffed\" their noses and tried to get up a sneering laugh, but failed.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],[0,"The Women of Mormondom (#7)"],[1,"by my grand-parents, so deeply impressed my mind, that as I  grew up to womanhood I fondly cherished a pride for the flag which so  proudly waved over the graves of my brave and valiant ancestors.\"    It was the poet's soul of this illustrious Mormon woman that first  enchanted the Church with inspired song, and her Hebraic faith and  life have given something of their peculiar tone to the entire Mormon  people, and especially the sisterhood; just as Joseph Smith and Brigham  Young gave the types and institutions to our modern Israel.    Sister Eliza R. Snow was born with more than the poet's soul. She was  a prophetess in her very nature,--endowed thus by her Creator, before  her birth. Her gifts are of race quality rather than of mere religious  training or growth. They have come down to her from the ages. From  her personal race indications, as well as from the whole tenor and  mission of her life, she would readily be pronounced to be of Hebrew  origin. One might very well fancy her to be a descendant of David  himself; indeed the Prophet Joseph, in blessing her, pronounced her  to be a daughter of Judah's royal house. She understands, nearly to  perfection, all of the inner views of the system and faith which she  represents. And the celestial relations and action of the great Mormon  drama, in other worlds, and in the \"eternities past and to come,\" have  constituted her most familiar studies and been in the rehearsals of her  daily ministry.    Mother Whitney says:        \"I was born the day after Christmas in the first year of the      present century, in the quiet, old-fashioned country town of Derby,      New Haven County, Conn. My parents' names were Gibson and Polly      Smith. The Smiths were among the earliest settlers there, and were      widely known. I was the oldest child, and grew up in an atmosphere      of love and tenderness. My parents were not professors of religion,      and according to puritanical ideas were grossly in fault to have      me taught dancing; but my father had his own peculiar notions upon      the subject, and wished me to possess and enjoy, in connection      with a sound education and strict morals, such accomplishments as      would fit me to fill, with credit to myself and my training, an      honorable position in society. He had no sympathy whatever with any      of the priests of that day, and was utterly at variance with their      teachings and ministry, notwithstanding he was strenuous on all      points of honor, honesty morality and uprightness.        \"There is nothing in my early life I remember with more intense      satisfaction than the agreeable companionship of my father. My      mother's health was delicate, and with her household affairs,      and two younger children, she gave herself up to domestic life,      allowing it to absorb her entire interest, and consequently I was      more particularly under my father's jurisdiction and influence;      our tastes were most congenial, and this geniality and happiness      surrounded me with its beneficial influence until I reached      my nineteenth year. Nothing in particular occurred to mar the      smoothness of my life's current and prosperity, and love beamed      upon our home.        \"About this time a new epoch in my life created a turning point      which unconsciously to us, who were the actors in the drama, caused      all my future to be entirely separate and distinct from those      with whom I had been reared and nurtured. My father's sister, a      spinster, who had money at her own disposal, and who was one of      those strong-minded women of whom so much is said in this our day,      concluded to emigrate to the great West,--at that time Ohio seemed      a fabulous distance from civilization and enlightenment, and going      to Ohio then was as great an undertaking as going to China or      Japan is at the present day. She entreated my parents to allow me      to accompany her, and promised to be as faithful and devoted to      me as possible, until they should join us, and that they expected      very shortly to do; their confidence in aunt Sarah's ability      and self-reliance was unbounded, and so, after much persuasion,      they consented to part with me for a short interval of time; but      circumstances, over which we mortals have no control, were so      overruled that I never saw my beloved mother again. Our journey was      a pleasant one; the beautiful scenery through which our route lay      had charms indescribable for me, who had never been farther from      home than New Haven, in which city I had passed a part of my time,      and to me it was nearer a paradise than any other place on earth.      The magnificent lakes, rivers, mountains, and romantic forests were      all delineations of nature which delighted my imagination.        \"We settled a few miles inland from the picturesque Lake Erie,      and here in after years, were the saints of God gathered and the      everlasting gospel proclaimed. My beloved aunt Sarah was a true      friend and instructor to me, and had much influence in maturing my      womanly character and developing my home education. She hated the      priests of the day, and believed them all deceivers and hypocrites;      her religion consisted in visiting the widow and the fatherless and      keeping herself 'unspotted from the world.'        \"Shortly after entering my twenty-first year I became acquainted      with a young man from Vermont, Newel K. Whitney, who, like myself,      had left home and relatives and was determined to carve out a      fortune for himself. He had been engaged in trading with the      settlers and Indians at Green Bay, Mich., buying furs extensively      for the eastern markets. In his travels to and from New York      he passed along the charming Lake Erie, and from some unknown      influence he concluded to settle and make a permanent home for      himself in this region of country; and then subsequently we met      and became acquainted; and being thoroughly convinced that we were      suited to each other, we were married by the Presbyterian minister      of that place, the Rev. J. Badger. We prospered in all our efforts      to accumulate wealth, so much so, that among our friends it came to      be remarked that nothing of Whitney's ever got lost on the lake,      and no product of his exportation was ever low in the market;      always ready sales and fair prices. We had neither of us ever made      any profession of religion, but contrary to my early education I      was naturally religious, and I expressed to my husband a wish that      we should unite ourselves to one of the churches, after examining      into their principles and deciding for ourselves. Accordingly we      united ourselves with the Campbellites, who were then making many      converts, and whose principles seemed most in accordance with      the scriptures. We continued in this church, which to us was the      nearest pattern to our Saviour's teachings, until Parley P. Pratt      and another elder preached the everlasting gospel in Kirtland.\"        CHAPTER V.    THE VOICE, AND THE MESSENGER OF THE COVENANT.    And there came one as a \"voice crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the  way of the Lord!\"    Thus ever!    A coming to Israel with \"a new and everlasting covenant;\" this was the  theme of the ancient prophets, now unfolded.    There was the voice crying in the wilderness of Ohio, just before the  advent of the latter-day prophet.    The voice was Sidney Rigdon. He was to Joseph Smith as a John the  Baptist.    The forerunner made straight the way in the wilderness of the virgin  West. He raised up a church of disciples in and around Kirtland. He led  those who afterwards became latter-day saints to faith in the promises,  and baptized them in water for the remission of sins. But he had not  power to baptize them with the Holy Ghost and with fire from heaven.  Yet he taught the literal fulfillment of the prophesies concerning the  last days, and heralded the advent of the \"one greater than I.\"    \"The same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"    That is ever the \"one greater than I,\" be his name whatever it may.    Joseph Smith baptized with the Holy Ghost. But Sidney knew not that he  was heralding Joseph.    And the prophet himself was but as the voice crying in the wilderness  of the great dark world: \"Prepare ye the way for the second advent of  earth's Lord.\" His mission was also to \"make straight in the desert a  highway\" for the God of Israel; for Israel was going up,--following the  angel of the covenant, to the chambers of the mountains.    He came with a great lamp and a great light in those days, dazzling to  the eyes of the generation that \"crucified\" him in its blindness.    Joseph was the sign of Messiah's coming. He unlocked the sealed heavens  by faith and \"election.\" He came in \"the spirit and power of Elijah.\"  The mantle of Elijah was upon him.    Be it always understood that the coming of Joseph Smith \"to restore the  covenant to Israel\" signifies the near advent of Messiah to reign as  King of Israel. Joseph was the Elijah of the last days.    These are the first principles of Mormonism. And to witness of their  truth this testament of the sisters is given, with the signs and  wonders proceeding from the mission of Him who unlocked the heavens and  preached the gospel of new revelations to the world, whose light of  revelation had gone out.    But first came the famous Alexander Campbell and his compeer, Sidney  Rigdon, to the West with the \"lamp.\" Seekers after truth, whose hearts  had, been strangely moved by some potent spirit, whose influence they  felt pervading but understood not, saw the lamp and admired.    Mr. Campbell, of Virginia, was a reformed Baptist. He with Sidney  Rigdon, a Mr. Walter Scott, and some other gifted men, had dissented  from the regular Baptists, from whom they"]]]
