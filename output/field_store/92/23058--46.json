On, then, doctor, at him, pray!    _Val._   Oh, heaven, thine aid afford,           Increase my strength and courage,           That in his blood my sword           May wipe out this fell outrage!    _Faust._ What fear is this unnerves my arm?           Why falters now my courage?           Dare I to take his life,           Who but resents an outrage?    _Mep._   His wrath and his courage           I laugh alike to scorn!           To horse, then, for his last journey           The youth right soon will take!    _Val._         (taking in his hand the medallion suspended round his neck).           Thou gift of Marguerite,           Which till now hath ever saved me,           I'll no more of thee--I cast thee hence!           Accursed gift, I throw thee from me!

Come on, defend thyself!    _Mep._                   (to FAUST, in a whisper).           Stand near to me, and attack him only;           I'll take care to parry!                       (They fight.)    _Val._                 (falling).           Ah!    _Mep._                 Behold our hero,           Lifeless on the ground!           Come, we must hence--quick, fly!

See, one has fallen;           The unhappy man lies prostrate there.           Ah! he moves--yes, still he breathes;           Quick, then, draw nigh           To raise and succor him!    _Val._   'Tis useless, cease these vain laments.           Too often have I gazed           On death, to heed it           When my own time hath come!        (MARGUERITE appears at the back, supported by SIEBEL.)    _Mar._        (advancing, and falling on her knees at VALENTINE's side).           Valentine! ah, Valentine!    _Val._                   (thrusting her from him).           Marguerite!           What would'st thou here?--away!    _Mar._   O heav'n!    _Val._   For her I die! Poor fool!           I thought to chastise her seducer!    _Cho._              (in a low voice, pointing to MARGUERITE).           He dies, slain by her seducer!    _Mar._   Fresh grief is this! ah, bitter punishment.    _Sie._   Have pity on her, pray!    _Val._                (supported by those around him).           Marguerite, give ear awhile;           That which was decreed           Hath duly come to pass.           Death comes at its good pleasure:           All mortals must obey its behest.           But for you intervenes an evil life!           Those white hands will never work more;           The labors and sorrows that others employ,           Will be forgotten in hours of joy.           Darest thou live, ingrate?           Darest thou still exist?           Go! Shame overwhelm thee! Remorse follow thee!           At length _thy_ hour will sound.           Die! And if God pardons thee hereafter,           So may this life be a continual curse!    _Cho._   Terrible wish! Unchristian thought!           In thy last sad hour, unfortunate!           Think of thy own soul's welfare.           Forgive, if thou wouldst be forgiven.    _Val._   Marguerite; I curse you! Death awaits me.           I die by your hand; but I die a soldier.                         (Dies.)  _Cho._   God receive thy spirit!           God pardon thy sins!                        (Curtain.)          ACT V.      SCENE I.    A Prison.    MARGUERITE asleep; FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Faust._ Go! get thee hence!    _Mep._   The morn appears, black night is on the wing.           Quickly prevail upon Marguerite to follow thee.           The jailer soundly sleeps--here is the key,           Thine own hand now can ope the door.    _Faust._ Good! Get thee gone!    _Mep._   Be sure thou tarry not!           I will keep watch without.                        (Exit.)    _Faust._ With grief my heart is wrung!           Oh, torture! oh, source of agony           And remorse eternal! Behold her there           The good, the beauteous girl,           Cast like a criminal           Into this vile dungeon;           Grief must her reason have disturbed,           For, with her own hand, alas!           Her child she slew!           Oh, Marguerite!    _Mar._                      (waking).           His voice did sure           Unto my heart resound.                      (Rises.)    _Faust._ Marguerite!    _Mar._   At that glad sound it wildly throbs again           Amid the mocking laugh of demons.    _Faust._ Marguerite!    _Mar._   Now am I free. He is here. It is his voice.           Yes, thou art he whom I love.           Fetters, death, have no terrors for me;           Thou hast found me. Thou hast returned.           Now am I saved! Now rest I on thy heart!    _Faust._ Yes, I am here, and I love thee,           In spite of the efforts of yon mocking demon.        (FAUST attempts to draw her with him.    She gently disengages herself from his arms.)    _Mar._   Stay! this is the spot           Where one day thou didst meet me.           Thine hand sought mine to clasp.           \"Will you not permit me, my fairest demoiselle,           To offer you my arm, and clear for you the way?\"           \"No, sir. I am no demoiselle, neither am I fair;           And I have no need to accept your offered arm.\"    _Faust._ What is't she says? Ah me! Ah me!    _Mar._   And the garden I love is here,           Odorous of myrtle and roses,           Where every eve thou camest in           With careful step, as night was falling.    _Faust._ Come, Marguerite, let us fly!    _Mar._   No! stay a moment!    _Faust._ O heav'n, she does not understand!                *       *       *       *       *      SCENE II.    MEPHISTOPHELES and the preceding.    _Mep._   Away at once, while yet there's time!           If longer ye delay,           Not e'en my power can save ye.    _Mar._   See'st thou yon demon crouching in the shade?           His deadly glance is fixed on us;           Quick! drive him from these sacred walls.    _Mep._   Away! leave we this spot,           The dawn hath appeared;           Hear'st thou not the fiery chargers,           As with sonorous hoof they paw the ground?              (Endeavoring to drag FAUST with him.)           Haste ye, then,--perchance there yet           Is time to save her!    _Mar._   O Heaven, I crave thy help!           Thine aid alone I do implore!                     (Kneeling.)           Holy angels, in heaven bless'd,           My spirit longs with ye to rest!           Great Heaven, pardon grant, I implore thee,           For soon shall I appear before thee!    _Faust._ Marguerite! Follow me, I implore!    _Mar._   Holy angels, in heaven bless'd,           My spirit longs with ye to rest!           Great Heaven, pardon grant, I implore thee,           For soon shall I appear before thee!    _Faust._ O Marguerite!    _Mar._   Why that glance with anger fraught?    _Faust._ Marguerite!    _Mar._   What blood is that which stains thy hand!           Away! thy sight doth cause me horror!                     (Falls.)    _Mep._   Condemned!    _Cho._   Saved!           Christ hath arisen!           Christ hath arisen!           Christ is born again!           Peace and felicity           To all disciples of the Master!           Christ hath arisen!        (The prison walls open. The soul of MARGUERITE rises towards    heaven. FAUST gazes despairingly after her, then falls on his    knees and prays.

Un livre est ouvert devant lui.)    _Faust._ Rien!...--En vain j'interroge, en mon ardente veille,           La nature et le Createur;           Pas une voix ne glisse a mon oreille           Un mot consolateur!

The most obvious conclusion, surely, is in  favour of design; and it requires time, reflection, and study, to summon  up those frivolous, though abstruse objections, which can support  Infidelity. Who can behold the male and female of each species, the  correspondence of their parts and instincts, their passions, and whole  course of life before and after generation, but must be sensible, that  the propagation of the species is intended by Nature? Millions and  millions of such instances present themselves through every part of the  universe; and no language can convey a more intelligible irresistible  meaning, than the curious adjustment of final causes. To what degree,  therefore, of blind dogmatism must one have attained, to reject such  natural and such convincing arguments?    Some beauties in writing we may meet with, which seem contrary to rules,  and which gain the affections, and animate the imagination, in opposition  to all the precepts of criticism, and to the authority of the established  masters of art. And if the argument for Theism be, as you pretend,  contradictory to the principles of logic; its universal, its irresistible  influence proves clearly, that there may be arguments of a like irregular  nature. Whatever cavils may be urged, an orderly world, as well as a  coherent, articulate speech, will still be received as an incontestable  proof of design and intention.    It sometimes happens, I own, that the religious arguments have not their  due influence on an ignorant savage and barbarian; not because they are  obscure and difficult, but because he never asks himself any question  with regard to them. Whence arises the curious structure of an animal?  From the copulation of its parents. And these whence? From their parents?  A few removes set the objects at such a distance, that to him they are  lost in darkness and confusion; nor is he actuated by any curiosity to  trace them further. But this is neither dogmatism nor scepticism, but  stupidity: a state of mind very different from your sifting, inquisitive  disposition, my ingenious friend. You can trace causes from effects: You  can compare the most distant and remote objects: and your greatest errors  proceed not from barrenness of thought and invention, but from too  luxuriant a fertility, which suppresses your natural good sense, by a  profusion of unnecessary scruples and objections.    Here I could observe, HERMIPPUS, that PHILO was a little embarrassed and  confounded: But while he hesitated in delivering an answer, luckily for  him, DEMEA broke in upon the discourse, and saved his countenance.    Your instance, CLEANTHES, said he, drawn from books and language, being  familiar, has, I confess, so much more force on that account: but is  there not some danger too in this very circumstance; and may it not  render us presumptuous, by making us imagine we comprehend the Deity, and  have some adequate idea of his nature and attributes? When I read a  volume, I enter into the mind and intention of the author: I become him,  in a manner, for the instant; and have an immediate feeling and  conception of those ideas which revolved in his imagination while  employed in that composition. But so near an approach we never surely can  make to the Deity. His ways are not our ways. His attributes are perfect,  but incomprehensible. And this volume of nature contains a great and  inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible discourse or reasoning.    The ancient PLATONISTS, you know, were the most religious and devout of  all the Pagan philosophers; yet many of them, particularly PLOTINUS,  expressly declare, that intellect or understanding is not to be ascribed  to the Deity; and that our most perfect worship of him consists, not in  acts of veneration, reverence, gratitude, or love; but in a certain  mysterious self-annihilation, or total extinction of all our faculties.  These ideas are, perhaps, too far stretched; but still it must be  acknowledged, that, by representing the Deity as so intelligible and  comprehensible, and so similar to a human mind, we are guilty of the  grossest and most narrow partiality, and make ourselves the model of the  whole universe.    All the sentiments of the human mind, gratitude, resentment, love,  friendship, approbation, blame, pity, emulation, envy, have a plain  reference to the state and situation of man, and are calculated for  preserving the existence and promoting the activity of such a being in  such circumstances. It seems, therefore, unreasonable to transfer such  sentiments to a supreme existence, or to suppose him actuated by them;  and the phenomena besides of the universe will not support us in such a  theory. All our ideas, derived from the senses, are confessedly false and  illusive; and cannot therefore be supposed to have place in a supreme  intelligence: And as the ideas of internal sentiment, added to those of  the external senses, compose the whole furniture of human understanding,  we may conclude, that none of the materials of thought are in any respect  similar in the human and in the divine intelligence. Now, as to the  manner of thinking; how can we make any comparison between them, or  suppose them any wise resembling? Our thought is fluctuating, uncertain,  fleeting, successive, and compounded; and were we to remove these  circumstances, we absolutely annihilate its essence, and it would in such  a case be an abuse of terms to apply to it the name of thought or reason.  At least if it appear more pious and respectful (as it really is) still  to retain these terms, when we mention the Supreme Being, we ought to  acknowledge, that their meaning, in that case, is totally  incomprehensible; and that the infirmities of our nature do not permit us  to reach any ideas which in the least correspond to the ineffable  sublimity of the Divine attributes.          PART 4      It seems strange to me, said CLEANTHES, that you, DEMEA, who are so  sincere in the cause of religion, should still maintain the mysterious,  incomprehensible nature of the Deity, and should insist so strenuously  that he has no manner of likeness or resemblance to human creatures. The  Deity, I can readily allow, possesses many powers and attributes of which  we can have no comprehension: But if our ideas, so far as they go, be not  just, and adequate, and correspondent to his real nature, I know not what  there is in this subject worth insisting on. Is the name, without any  meaning, of such mighty importance? Or how do you mystics, who maintain  the absolute incomprehensibility of the Deity, differ from Sceptics or  Atheists, who assert, that the first cause of all is unknown and  unintelligible? Their temerity must be very great, if, after rejecting  the production by a mind, I mean a mind resembling the human, (for I know  of no other,) they pretend to assign, with certainty, any other specific  intelligible cause: And their conscience must be very scrupulous indeed,  if they refuse to call the universal unknown cause a God or Deity; and to  bestow on him as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning epithets as you  shall please to require of them.    Who could imagine, replied DEMEA, that CLEANTHES, the calm philosophical  CLEANTHES, would attempt to refute his antagonists by affixing a nickname  to them; and, like the common bigots and inquisitors of the age, have  recourse to invective and declamation, instead of reasoning? Or does he  not perceive, that these topics are easily retorted, and that  Anthropomorphite is an appellation as invidious, and implies as dangerous  consequences, as the epithet of Mystic, with which he has honoured us? In  reality, CLEANTHES, consider what it is you assert when you represent the  Deity as similar to a human mind and understanding. What is the soul of  man? A composition of various faculties, passions, sentiments, ideas;  united, indeed, into one self or person, but still distinct from each  other. When it reasons, the ideas, which are the parts of its discourse,  arrange themselves in a certain form or order; which is not preserved  entire for a moment, but immediately gives place to another arrangement.  New opinions, new passions, new affections, new feelings arise, which  continually diversify the mental scene, and produce in it the greatest  variety and most rapid succession imaginable. How is this compatible with  that perfect immutability and simplicity which all true Theists ascribe  to the Deity? By the same act, say they, he sees past, present, and  future: His love and hatred, his mercy and justice, are one individual  operation: He is entire in every point of space; and complete in every  instant of duration. No succession, no change, no acquisition, no  diminution. What he is implies not in it any shadow of distinction or  diversity. And what he is this moment he ever has been, and ever will be,  without any new judgement, sentiment, or operation. He stands fixed in  one simple, perfect state: nor can you ever say, with any propriety, that  this act of his is different from that other; or that this judgement or  idea has been lately formed, and will give place, by succession, to any  different judgement or idea.    I can readily allow, said CLEANTHES, that those who maintain the perfect  simplicity of the Supreme Being, to the extent in which you have  explained it, are complete Mystics, and chargeable with all the  consequences which I have drawn from their opinion. They are, in a word,  Atheists, without knowing it. For though it be allowed, that the Deity  possesses attributes of which we have no comprehension, yet ought we  never to ascribe to him any attributes which are absolutely incompatible  with that intelligent nature essential to him. A mind, whose acts and  sentiments and ideas are not distinct and successive; one, that is wholly  simple, and totally immutable, is a mind"]]]
