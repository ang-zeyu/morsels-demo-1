But, that one thing may stand under or support another, must it  not be extended?    HYL.  It must.    PHIL.  Is not therefore this supposition liable to the same absurdity  with the former?    HYL.  You still take things in a strict literal sense. That is not fair,  Philonous.    PHIL.  I am not for imposing any sense on your words: you are at liberty  to explain them as you please. Only, I beseech you, make me understand  something by them. You tell me Matter supports or stands under accidents.  How! is it as your legs support your body?    HYL.  No; that is the literal sense.    PHIL.  Pray let me know any sense, literal or not literal, that you  understand it in.--How long must I wait for an answer, Hylas?    HYL.  I declare I know not what to say. I once thought I understood well  enough what was meant by Matter's supporting accidents. But now, the more  I think on it the less can I comprehend it: in short I find that I know  nothing of it.    PHIL.  It seems then you have no idea at all, neither relative nor  positive, of Matter; you know neither what it is in itself, nor what  relation it bears to accidents?    HYL.  I acknowledge it.    PHIL.  And yet you asserted that you could not conceive how qualities or  accidents should really exist, without conceiving at the same time a  material support of them?    HYL.  I did.    PHIL.  That is to say, when you conceive the real existence of  qualities, you do withal conceive Something which you cannot conceive?    HYL.  It was wrong, I own. But still I fear there is some fallacy or  other. Pray what think you of this? It is just come into my head that the  ground of all our mistake lies in your treating of each quality by  itself. Now, I grant that each quality cannot singly subsist without the  mind. Colour cannot without extension, neither can figure without some  other sensible quality. But, as the several qualities united or blended  together form entire sensible things, nothing hinders why such things may  not be supposed to exist without the mind.    PHIL.  Either, Hylas, you are jesting, or have a very bad memory. Though  indeed we went through all the qualities by name one after another, yet  my arguments or rather your concessions, nowhere tended to prove that the  Secondary Qualities did not subsist each alone by itself; but, that they  were not AT ALL without the mind. Indeed, in treating of figure  and motion we concluded they could not exist without the mind, because it  was impossible even in thought to separate them from all secondary  qualities, so as to conceive them existing by themselves. But then this  was not the only argument made use of upon that occasion. But (to pass by  all that hath been hitherto said, and reckon it for nothing, if you will  have it so) I am content to put the whole upon this issue. If you can  conceive it possible for any mixture or combination of qualities, or any  sensible object whatever, to exist without the mind, then I will grant it  actually to be so.    HYL.  If it comes to that the point will soon be decided. What more easy  than to conceive a tree or house existing by itself, independent of, and  unperceived by, any mind whatsoever? I do at this present time conceive  them existing after that manner.    PHIL.  How say you, Hylas, can you see a thing which is at the same time  unseen?    HYL.  No, that were a contradiction.    PHIL.  Is it not as great a contradiction to talk of CONCEIVING a  thing which is UNCONCEIVED?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  The tree or house therefore which you think of is conceived by  you?    HYL.  How should it be otherwise?    PHIL.  And what is conceived is surely in the mind?    HYL.  Without question, that which is conceived is in the mind.    PHIL.  How then came you to say, you conceived a house or tree existing  independent and out of all minds whatsoever?    HYL.  That was I own an oversight; but stay, let me consider what led me  into it.--It is a pleasant mistake enough. As I was thinking of a tree in  a solitary place, where no one was present to see it, methought that was  to conceive a tree as existing unperceived or unthought of; not  considering that I myself conceived it all the while. But now I plainly  see that all I can do is to frame ideas in my own mind. I may indeed  conceive in my own thoughts the idea of a tree, or a house, or a  mountain, but that is all. And this is far from proving that I can  conceive them EXISTING OUT OF THE MINDS OF ALL SPIRITS.    PHIL.  You acknowledge then that you cannot possibly conceive how any  one corporeal sensible thing should exist otherwise than in the mind?    HYL.  I do.    PHIL.  And yet you will earnestly contend for the truth of that which  you cannot so much as conceive?    HYL.  I profess I know not what to think; but still there are some  scruples remain with me. Is it not certain I SEE THINGS at a distance?  Do we not perceive the stars and moon, for example, to be a great way  off? Is not this, I say, manifest to the senses?    PHIL.  Do you not in a dream too perceive those or the like objects?    HYL.  I do.    PHIL.  And have they not then the same appearance of being distant?    HYL.  They have.    PHIL.  But you do not thence conclude the apparitions in a dream to be  without the mind?    HYL.  By no means.    PHIL.  You ought not therefore to conclude that sensible objects are  without the mind, from their appearance, or manner wherein they are  perceived.    HYL.  I acknowledge it. But doth not my sense deceive me in those cases?    PHIL.  By no means. The idea or thing which you immediately perceive,  neither sense nor reason informs you that it actually exists without the  mind. By sense you only know that you are affected with such certain  sensations of light and colours, &c. And these you will not say are  without the mind.    HYL.  True: but, beside all that, do you not think the sight suggests  something of OUTNESS OR DISTANCE?    PHIL.  Upon approaching a distant object, do the visible size and figure  change perpetually, or do they appear the same at all distances?    HYL.  They are in a continual change.    PHIL.  Sight therefore doth not suggest, or any way inform you, that the  visible object you immediately perceive exists at a distance, or will be  perceived when you advance farther onward; there being a continued series  of visible objects succeeding each other during the whole time of your  approach.    HYL.  It doth not; but still I know, upon seeing an object, what object  I shall perceive after having passed over a certain distance: no  matter whether it be exactly the same or no: there is still something of  distance suggested in the case.    PHIL.  Good Hylas, do but reflect a little on the point, and then tell  me whether there be any more in it than this: from the ideas you actually  perceive by sight, you have by experience learned to collect what other  ideas you will (according to the standing order of nature) be affected  with, after such a certain succession of time and motion.    HYL.  Upon the whole, I take it to be nothing else.    PHIL.  Now, is it not plain that if we suppose a man born blind was on a  sudden made to see, he could at first have no experience of what may be  SUGGESTED by sight?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  He would not then, according to you, have any notion of distance  annexed to the things he saw; but would take them for a new set of  sensations, existing only in his mind?    HYL.  It is undeniable.    PHIL.  But, to make it still more plain: is not DISTANCE a line turned  endwise to the eye?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  And can a line so situated be perceived by sight?    HYL.  It cannot.    PHIL.  Doth it not therefore follow that distance is not properly and  immediately perceived by sight?    HYL.  It should seem so.    PHIL.  Again, is it your opinion that colours are at a distance?    HYL.  It must be acknowledged they are only in the mind.    PHIL.  But do not colours appear to the eye as coexisting in the same  place with extension and figures?    HYL.  They do.    PHIL.  How can you then conclude from sight that figures exist without,  when you acknowledge colours do not; the sensible appearance being the  very same with regard to both?    HYL.  I know not what to answer.    PHIL.  But, allowing that distance was truly and immediately perceived  by the mind, yet it would not thence follow it existed out of the mind.  For, whatever is immediately perceived is an idea: and can any idea exist  out of the mind?    HYL.  To suppose that were absurd: but, inform me, Philonous, can we  perceive or know nothing beside our ideas?    PHIL.  As for the rational deducing of causes from effects, that  is beside our inquiry. And, by the senses you can best tell whether you  perceive anything which is not immediately perceived. And I ask you,  whether the things immediately perceived are other than your own  sensations or ideas? You have indeed more than once, in the course of  this conversation, declared yourself on those points; but you seem, by  this last question, to have departed from what you then thought.    HYL.  To speak the truth, Philonous, I think there are two kinds of  objects:--the one perceived immediately, which are likewise called  IDEAS; the other are real things or external objects, perceived by the  mediation of ideas, which are their images and representations. Now, I  own ideas do not exist without the mind; but the latter sort of objects  do. I am sorry I did not think of this distinction sooner; it would  probably have cut short your discourse.    PHIL.  Are those external objects perceived by sense or by some other  faculty?    HYL.  They are perceived by sense.    PHIL.  Howl Is there any thing perceived by sense which is not  immediately perceived?    HYL.  Yes, Philonous, in some sort there is. For example, when I look on  a picture or statue of Julius Caesar, I may be said after a manner to  perceive him (though not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#7)"],[1,"  Esther, kindly see Helen's clothes are  ready for boarding school--next Monday morning.\"          CHAPTER V    \"Next Monday Morning\"      There was a trunk standing in the hall, and a large, much-travelled  portmanteau, and there were labels on them that said: \"Miss Helen  Woolcot, The Misses Burton, Mount Victoria.\"    In the nursery breakfast was proceeding spasmodically.  Meg's  blue eyes were all red and swollen with crying, and she was still  sniffing audibly as she poured out the coffee.  Pip had his hands  in his pockets and stood on the hearthrug, looking gloomily at a  certain plate, and refusing breakfast altogether; the General was  crashing his own mug and plate joyously together; and Bunty  was eating bread and butter in stolid silence.    Judy, white-faced and dry-eyed, was sitting at the table, and Nell  and Baby were clinging to either arm.  All the three days between  that black Thursday and this doleful morning she had been obstinately  uncaring.  Her spirits had never seemed higher, her eyes brighter,  her tongue sharper, than during that interval of days; and she had  pretended to everyone, and her father, that she especially thought  boarding school must be great fun, and that she should enjoy it  immensely.    But this morning she had collapsed altogether.  All the time before,  her hot childish heart had been telling her that her father could  not really be so cruel, that he did not really mean to send her  away among strangers, away from dear, muddled old Misrule and all  her sisters and brothers; he was only saying it to frighten her,  she kept saying to herself, and she would show him she was not  a chickenhearted baby.    But on Sunday night, when she saw a trunk carried downstairs  and filled with her things and labelled with her name, a cold  hand seemed to close about her heart.  Still, she said to herself,  he was doing all this to make it seem more real.    But now it was morning, and she could disbelieve it no longer.  Esther had come to her bedside and kissed her sorrowfully, her  beautiful face troubled and tender.  She had begged as she had  never done before for a remission of poor Judy's sentence, but  the Captain was adamant.  It was she and she only who was always  ringleader in everything; the others would behave when she was not  there to incite them to mischief and go she should.  Besides, he  said, it would be the making of her.  It was an excellent school  he had chosen for her; the ladies who kept it were kind, but very  firm, and Judy was being ruined for want of a firm hand.  Which,  indeed, was in a measure true.    Judy sat bolt upright in bed at the sight of Esther's sorrowful  face.    \"It's no good, dear; there's no way out of it,\" she said gently.  \"But you'll go like a brave girl, won't you, Ju-Ju?  You always  were the sort to die game, as Pip says.\"    Judy gulped down a great lump in her throat, and her poor little  face grew white and drawn.    \"It's all right, Essie.  There, you go on down to breakfast,\"  she said, in a voice that, only shook a little; \"and please  leave the General, Esther; I'll bring him down with me.\"    Esther deposited her little fat son on the pillow, and with one  loving backward glance went out of the door.    And Judy pulled the little lad down into her arms, and covered the  bedclothes right over both their heads, and held him in a fierce,  almost desperate clasp for a minute or two, and buried her face  in his soft, dimpled neck, and kissed it till her lips ached.    He fought manfully against these troublesome proceedings, and at  last objected, with an angry scream, to being suffocated.  So she  flung back the clothes and got out of bed, leaving him to burrow  about among the pillows, and pull feathers out of a hole in one  of them.    She dressed in a quick nervous fashion, did her hair with more  care than usual, and then picked up the General and took him along  the passage into the nursery.  All the others were here, and, with  Esther, were evidently discussing her.  The three girls looked  tearful and protesting; Pip had just been brought to book for  speaking disrespectfully of his father, and was looking sullen;  and Bunty, not knowing what else to do at such a crisis, had fallen  to catching flies, and was viciously taking off their wings.    It was a wretched meal: The bell sounded for the downstairs  breakfast, and Esther had to go.  Everyone offered Judy everything  on the table, and spoke gently and politely to her.  She seemed  to be apart from them, a person not to be lightly treated in the  dignity of this great trouble.  Her dress, too, was quite new--a  neat blue serge fresh from the dressmaker's hands; her boots  were blacked and bright, her stockings guiltless of ventilatory  chasms.  All this helped to make her a Judy quite different from  the harum-scarum one of a few days back, who used to come to  breakfast looking as if her clothes had been pitchforked upon her.    Baby addressed herself to her porridge for one minute, but the  next her feelings overcame her, and, with a little wail, she rushed  round the table to Judy, and hung on her arm sobbing.  This  destroyed the balance of the whole company.  Nell got the other arm  and swayed to and fro in an excess of misery. Meg's tears rained  down into her teacup; Pip dug his heel in the hearthrug, and  wondered what was the matter with his eyes; and even Bunty's  appetite for bread and butter diminished.    Judy sat there silent; she had pushed back her unused plate, and  sat regarding it with an expression of utter despair on her  young face.  She looked like a miniature tragedy queen going to  immediate execution.    Presently Bunty got off his chair, covered up his coffee with his  saucer to keep the flies out, and solemnly left the room.  In a  minute he returned with a pickle bottle, containing an enormous  green frog.    \"You can have it to keep for your very own, Judy,\" he said, in a  tone of almost reckless sadness.  \"It'll, keep you amused, perhaps,  at school.\"  Self-sacrifice could go no further, for this frog was  the darling of Bunty's heart.    This stimulated the others; everyone fetched some offering to lay  at Judy's shrine for a keepsake.  Meg brought a bracelet, plaited  out of the hair of a defunct pet pony.  Pip gave his three-bladed  pocketknife.  Nell a pot of musk that she had watered and cherished  for a year, Baby had a broken-nosed doll, that was the Benjamin of  her large family.    \"Put them in the trunk, Meg--there's room on top, I think,\" Judy  said in a choking voice, and deeply touched by these gifts.  \"Oh!  and, Bunty, dear! put a cork over the f--f--frog, will you? it  might get lost, poor thing! in that b--b--big box.\"    \"All right,\" said Bunty, \"You'll take c--c--care of it, w--won't  you, Judy?  Oh dear, oh--h--h!--boo-hoo!\"    Then Esther came in, still troubled-looking.  \"The dogcart is  round,\" she said.  \"Are you ready, Ju, dearest?  Dear little Judy!  be brave, little old woman.\"    But Judy was white as death, and utterly limp.  She suffered  Esther to put her hat on, to help her into her new jacket, to put  her gloves into her hand.  She submitted to being kissed by the  whole family, to be half carried downstairs by Esther, to be  kissed again by the girls, then by the two good-natured domestics,  who, in spite of her peccadilloes, had a warm place in their hearts  for her.    Esther and Pip lifted her into the dogcart; and she sat in a  little, huddled-up way, looking down at the group on the veranda  with eyes that were absolutely tragic in their utter despair.  Her  father came out, buttoning his overcoat, and saw the look.    \"What foolishness is this?\" he said irascibly--\"Esther-great  heavens! are you making a goose of yourself, too?\"--there were  great tears glistening in his wife's beautiful eyes.  \"Upon my  soul, one would think I was going to take the child to be hanged,  or at least was going to leave her in a penitentiary.\"    A great dry sob broke from Judy's white lips.    \"If you'll let me stay, Father, I'll never do another thing to vex  you; and you can thrash me instead, ever so hard.\"    It was her last effort, her final hope, and she bit her poor  quivering lip till it bled while she waited for his answer.    \"Let her stay--oh! do letter stay, we'll be good always,\" came  in a chorus from the veranda.  And, \"Let her stay, John, PLEASE!\"  Esther called in a tone as entreating as any of the children.    But the Captain sprang into the dogcart and seized the reins from  Pat in a burst of anger.    \"I think you're all demented!\" he cried.  \"She's going to a  thoroughly good home, I've paid a quarter in advance already,  and I can assure you good people I'm not going to waste it.\"    He gave the horse a smart touch with the whip, and in a minute  the dogcart had flashed out of the gate, and the small, unhappy  face was lost to sight.          CHAPTER VI    The Sweetness of Sweet Sixteen      \"She is not yet so old    But she may learn: happier than this,    She is not bred so dull but she can learn.\"      Meg's hair had always been pretty, but during the last two months  she had cut herself a fringe, and begun to torture it up in curl  papers every night.  And in her private drawer she kept a jam tin  filled with oatmeal, that she used in the water every time she  washed, having read it was a great complexion beautifier.  And  nightly she rubbed vaseline on her hands and slept in old kid  gloves.  And her spare money went in the purchase of \"Freckle  Lotion,\" to remove that slight powdering of warm brown sun-kisses  that somehow lent a certain character to her face.    All these things were the outcome of being sixteen, and having  found a friend of seventeen.    Aldith MacCarthy learnt French from the same teacher that Meg  was going to twice a week, and after an exchange of chocolates,  hair-ribbons, and family confidences a friendship sprang up.
