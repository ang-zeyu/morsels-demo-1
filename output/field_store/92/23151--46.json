Late in the summer of 1839 the Twelve began their departure,  usually in pairs, for foreign lands. The work had already been  introduced into England by the labors of Elder Heber C. Kimball and  associates, Elder Orson Hyde of the quorum of the Twelve; also Elders  Willard Richards, Isaac Russell, John Goodson, John Snyder; and Joseph  Fielding, a priest. The mission of the Twelve to England as a quorum,  however, established the work in the British Isles on a broader and  more {XXXI} permanent basis, and thence forward the body religious was  strengthened from this mission; and as much from the character as from  the numbers of the British Saints.    _The Mission of Orson Hyde to Palestine_.    The mission appointed to Elders Orson Hyde and John E. Page, of the  quorum of the Twelve, to Jerusalem, was second in importance only to  that appointed to the rest of the Twelve to Great Britain. John E.  Page utterly failed to fulfill his appointment, notwithstanding the  frequent urging and reproofs of the Prophet. He never left the shores  of America, and finally returned to Nauvoo to be severely censured for  his lack of faith and energy. Orson Hyde, on the contrary, in the midst  of many hardships, persevered in his journey to the Holy Land, until  he succeeded in accomplishing that which had been appointed unto him.  Elder Hyde it appears, was a descendant of the tribe of Judah; [19]  and sometime after the Prophet had become acquainted with him, most  probably in the year 1832, in the course of pronouncing a blessing upon  him, said: \"In due time thou shalt go to Jerusalem, the land of thy  fathers, and be a watchman unto the house of Israel; and by thy hand  shall the Most High do a great work, which shall prepare the way and  greatly facilitate the gathering together of that people.\" [20] It was  in fulfillment of this prediction upon his head that he had been called  upon this mission to Jerusalem, to dedicate the land of Palestine by  apostolic authority, preparatory to the return of the Jews and other  of the tribes of Israel to that land of promise. This mission he fully  accomplished. An account of his journey and of his beautiful and  powerful prayer of dedication will be found in his letters published in  this volume. [21]    The question will be asked, Has anything resulted from this mission  to dedicate the land of Palestine to the return of the Jews and other  tribes of Israel? The only answer is an appeal to facts, to events  that have taken place since that prayer of consecration was offered up  by this Apostle of the new dispensation of the Gospel, on the 24th of  October, 1841.    At the time of Elder Hyde's visit and the ceremonies of dedication he  performed on the Mount of Olives, there were comparatively but few  Jews at Jerusalem. As late as 1876 the British Consul Reports show  that there were but from fifteen to twenty thousand Jews in Judea.  But twenty years later the same authority declared the number of Jews  at sixty to seventy thousand; and, what was of more importance than  {XXXII} the numbers announced, these reports represented that the new  Jewish population was turning its attention to the cultivation of the  soil, which but requires the blessings of God upon it to restore it to  its ancient fruitfulness, and which will make it possible for it to  sustain once more a numerous population. The St. Louis _Globe-Democrat_  commenting on these Consular Reports of 1896, said:    \"Only two decades ago there were not more than fifteen or twenty  thousand Jews in Jerusalem. At that time no houses were to be found  outside the walls of the city. Since then many changes have taken place  and the Hebrew population--mainly on account of the increase of the  Jewish immigration from Russia--now stands at between sixty and seventy  thousand. Whole streets of houses have been built outside the walls  on the site of the ancient suburban districts, which for hundreds of  years have remained deserted. It is not, however, only in Jerusalem  itself that the Jews abound, but throughout Palestine they are buying  farms and establishing themselves in a surprisingly rapid manner. In  Jerusalem they form at present a larger community than either the  Christian or the Mohammedan.\"    Also in 1896 that racial movement among the Jews known as \"Zionism\"  took definite form. This movement was really the federation of all  the Jewish societies that have cherished the hope of seeing Israel  restored to his promised possessions in Palestine. That year the first  international conference of Zionists was held in Basel, Switzerland,  and since then under the leadership of the late Dr. Herzel of Austria,  and since his death under the leadership of Israel Zangwill, and by  reason of its annual conferences constantly increasing in interest  and attendance, \"Zionism\" has taken on all the aspects of one of the  world's great movements. It is not so much a religious movement as a  racial one; for prominent Jews of all shades of both political and  religious opinions have participated in it.    After saying through so many centuries at the feast of the Passover,  \"May we celebrate the next Passover in Jerusalem,\" the thought seems  to have occurred to some Jewish minds that if that hope is ever to  be realized some practical steps must be taken looking to the actual  achievement of the possibility--hence the \"Zionite Movement.\" The  keynotes of that movement are heard in the following utterances of some  of the Jewish leaders in explanation of it: \"We want to resume the  broken thread of our national existence; we want to show to the world  the moral strength, the intellectual power of the Jewish people. We  want a place where the race can be centralized.\"--(Leon Zoltokoff). \"It  is for these Jews (of Russia, Roumania and Galicia) that the name of  their country (Palestine) spells 'Hope.' I should not be a man if I did  not realize that for these persecuted Jews, Jerusalem spells reason,  {XXXIII} justice, manhood and liberty.\"--(Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch).  \"Jewish nationalism on a modern basis in Palestine, the old home of  the people.\"--(Max Nordau). \"Palestine needs a people, Israel needs  a country. Give the country without a people to the people without a  country.\"--(Israel Zangwill). In a word it is the purpose of \"Zionism\"  to redeem Palestine, and give it back to Jewish control, create, in  fact, a Jewish state in the land promised to their fathers.    The age has come when the promises of the Lord to Israel must be  fulfilled; and hence an apostle of the new dispensation of the  Gospel is sent by divine authority to dedicate the land of Palestine  preparatory to the return of Israel to his promised inheritance.  After which follows this strange and world-wide movement among the  Jews looking to the re-establishment of \"Jewish nationalism on a  modern basis in Palestine.\" What other relationship can exist between  the mission of the Apostle Orson Hyde and this world-wide movement  among the Jews for the re-establishment of Israel in Palestine, but  the relationship of cause to effect--under, of course, the larger  fact that the set time for the restoration of Israel has come? The  apostle's mission to Jerusalem for the purpose of dedicating that land,  preparatory to the return of Israel, was without doubt part of the  general program for the restoration of Israel to their lands and to the  favor and blessing of God.    _The Doctrinal Development of the Church_.    The doctrinal development in this period of the dispensation of the  fullness of times, namely, between July, 1839, and the month of May,  1842, about three years, was chiefly in relation to salvation for  the dead, and the sacred ritual of the Temple. The foundation for  this doctrinal development in relation to salvation for the dead, was  laid in the very inception of the work. On the occasion of the first  visit of the angel Moroni to the Prophet, on the night of the 21st of  September, 1823, among other ancient prophecies quoted by him, and  which he declared was soon to be fulfilled, was the prophecy in the  fourth chapter of Malachi in relation to the future coming of Elijah  the prophet, \"before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the  Lord.\" As quoted by the angel there was a slight variation in the  language from King James' version, as follows: \"Behold, I will reveal  unto you the Priesthood by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the  coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall plant in  the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the  hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers; if it were not so,  the whole world would be wasted at his coming.\" [22]    Here the promise is made, that in consequence of the restoration of  a certain Priesthood, or special keys of authority held by Elijah,  the promises made to the fathers shall be planted in the hearts of  the children, \"and the hearts of the children shall turn to their  fathers.\" Why? For a complete answer to that question the Church  waited some years. Again, and still early in the history of the  work, namely, March, 1830, the Lord in a revelation to Martin Harris  through the Prophet Joseph, added another line or two of knowledge  to this doctrine; knowledge which pushed out of the horizon of men's  conceptions the terrible and unjust doctrine respecting the eternal  punishment which God is supposed to inflict upon those who fail to obey  the Gospel in this life, and also those who died in ignorance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60736"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 5 (#7)"],[1,"it in its glorified and  perfected state; the coming of the Son of Man; the persistence of  acquired knowledge; the impossibility of being saved in ignorance (pp.  323-5). But the climax in doctrine as in moral daring is reached in  this volume by the Prophet committing to writing the revelation on the  eternity of the marriage covenant, and, under special circumstances and  divine sanction the rightfulness, of a plurality of wives. As the time  at which this revelation was given has been questioned, and also the  authorship of it, extended consideration is given to both these matters  in the following treatise:    _The Time When the Revelation on the Eternity of the Marriage  Covenant, Including a Plurality of Wives, Was Given, and its  Authorship_.    I.    _The Date of the Revelation_.    The date in the heading of the Revelation on the Eternity of the  Marriage Covenant, Including the Plurality of Wives, notes the time at  which the revelation was committed to writing, not the time at which  the principles set forth in the revelation were first made known to  the Prophet. This is evident from the written revelation itself which  discloses the fact that Joseph Smith was already in the relationship of  plural marriage, as the following passage witnesses:    \"And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been  given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me.\"    There is indisputable evidence that the revelation making known this  marriage law was given to the Prophet as early as 1831. In that year,  and thence intermittently up to 1833, the Prophet was engaged in a  revision of the English Bible text under the inspiration of God, Sidney  Rigdon in the main acting as his scribe. As he began his revision with  the Old Testament, he would be dealing with the age of the Patriarchs  in 1831. He was doubtless struck with the favor in which the Lord held  the several Bible Patriarchs of that period, notwithstanding they had  a plurality of wives. What more natural than that he should inquire  of the Lord at that time, when his mind must have been impressed with  the fact--Why, O Lord, didst Thou justify Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac  {XXX} and Jacob; as also Moses, David, and Solomon, in the matter of  their having many wives and concubines (see opening paragraph of the  Revelation)? In answer to that inquiry came the revelation, though not  then committed to writing.    Corroborative evidences of the fact of the revelation having been given  thus early in the Prophet's career are to be found in the early charges  against the Church about its belief in \"polygamy.\" For example: When  the Book of Doctrine and Covenants was presented to the several quorums  of the priesthood of the Church for acceptance in the general assembly  of that body, the 17th of August, 1835, an article on \"Marriage\" was  presented by W. W. Phelps, which for many years was published in the  Doctrine and Covenants. It was not a revelation, nor was it presented  as such to the general assembly of the priesthood. It was an article,  however, that represented the views of the assembly on the subject of  marriage at that time, unenlightened as they were by the revelation  already given to the Prophet on the subject. What the Prophet Joseph's  connection was with this article cannot be learned. Whether he approved  it or not is uncertain, since he was absent from Kirtland at the time  of the general assembly of the priesthood which accepted it, on a visit  to the Saints in Michigan (see HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, Vol. I, pp.  243-53).    In this article on marriage the following sentence occurs:    \"Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime  of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man  should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in case of  death, when either is at liberty to marry again.\"    From this it is evident that as early at least as 1835 a charge of  polygamy was made against the Church. Why was that the case unless the  subject of \"polygamy\" had been mooted within the Church? Is it not  evident that some one to whom the Prophet had confided the knowledge of  the revelation he had received concerning the rightfulness of plural  marriage--under certain circumstances--had unwisely made some statement  concerning the matter?    Again, in May, 1836, in Missouri, in a series of questions asked and  answered through the _Elder's Journal_, the following occurs:    \"Do the Mormons believe in having more wives than one?\"    To which the answer is given:    \"No, not at the same time.\"    This again represents the belief of the Saints at that time,  unenlightened as they then were by the revelation received by their  Prophet. But again, why this question unless there had been some  agitation of the subject? Had some one before the time had come for  making known this doctrine to the Church, again unwisely referred to  the knowledge {XXXI} which had been revealed to the Prophet some seven  years earlier?    All these incidents blend together and make it clearly evident that the  revelation on marriage was given long before the 12th of July, 1843.  Doubtless as early as 1831.    In addition to these indirect evidences is the direct testimony of the  late Elder Orson Pratt, of the council of the Twelve Apostles. In 1878,  in company with President Joseph F. Smith, Elder Pratt visited several  states east of the Mississippi in the capacity of a missionary; and  at Plano, Illinois, at a meeting of the so-called Reorganized Church  of the Latter-day Saints, he was invited by the presiding officer,  a Mr. Dille, and the meeting, to occupy the time, which he did. In  his remarks, according to his own and his companion's report of the  meeting--    \"Elder Pratt gave a plain, simple narration of his early experience  in the Church, relating many interesting incidents connected with its  rise; explained the circumstances under which several revelations were  received by Joseph, the Prophet, and the manner in which he received  them, he being present on several occasions of the kind. Declared  [that] at such times Joseph used the Seerstone when inquiring of the  Lord, and receiving revelation, but that he was so thoroughly endowed  with the inspiration of the Almighty and the spirit of revelation that  he often received them without any instrument, or other means than  the operation of the spirit upon his mind. Referred to the testimony  which he received of the truth of the great latter-day work while yet a  boy. Testified that these things were not matters of belief only with  him, but of actual knowledge. He explained the circumstances connected  with the coming forth of the revelation on plural marriage. Refuted  the statement and belief of those present that Brigham Young was the  author of that revelation; showed that Joseph Smith the Prophet had  not only commenced the practice himself, and taught it to others,  before President Young and the Twelve had returned from their mission  in Europe, in 1841, but that Joseph actually received revelations upon  that principle as early as 1831. Said: 'Lyman Johnson, who was very  familiar with Joseph at this early date, Joseph living at his father's  house, and who was also very intimate with me, we having traveled on  several missions together, told me himself that Joseph had made known  to him as early as 1831, that plural marriage was a correct principle.  Joseph declared to Lyman that God had revealed it to him, but that the  time had not come to teach or practice it in the Church, but that the  time would come.' To this statement Elder Pratt bore his testimony. He  cited several instances of Joseph having had wives sealed to him, one  at least as early as April 5th, 1841, which was some time prior to the  return of the Twelve from England. Referred to his own trial in regard  to this matter in Nauvoo, and said it was because he {XXXII} got his  information from a wicked source, from those disaffected, but as soon  as he learned the truth, he was satisfied.    (Signed) \"Orson Pratt,    (Signed) \"Joseph F. Smith\"    (The above is taken from a signed report of Elders Orson Pratt and  Joseph F. Smith of the Council of the Twelve on the occasion of their  visit to the East in 1878, and is to be found in the _Millennial Star_,  Vol. 40, Nos. 49 and 50.)    Relative to committing the revelation to writing on the 12th of July,  1843, that can best be told by the man who wrote the revelation as the  Prophet Joseph dictated it to him, William Clayton; and the man who  copied it the day following, Joseph Kingsbury; and from which copy  the revelation was afterwards printed as it now stands in the current  edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. In a sworn statement before John  T. Caine, a notary public in Salt Lake City, on February 16th, 1874,  William Clayton said:    \"On the 7th of October, 1842, in the presence of Bishop Newel K.  Whitney and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, President Joseph Smith appointed  me Temple Recorder, and also his private clerk, placing all records,  books papers, etc., in my care, and requiring me to take charge of and  preserve them, his closing words being, 'when I have any revelations to  write, you are the one to write them.' * * * On the morning of the 12th  of July, 1843; Joseph and Hyrum Smith came into the office in the upper  story of the brick store, on the bank of the Mississippi river. They  were talking on the subject of plural marriage. Hyrum said to Joseph,  'If you will write the revelation on celestial marriage, I will take  it and read it to Emma, and I believe I can convince her of its truth,  and you will hereafter have peace.' Joseph smiled and remarked, 'You do  not know Emma as well as I do.' Hyrum repeated his opinion, and further  remarked, 'The doctrine is so plain, I can convince any reasonable  man or woman of its truth, purity and heavenly origin,' or words to "]]]
