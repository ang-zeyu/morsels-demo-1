You must transform us while  we are together.\"    \"I won't do that,\" asserted Kiki, firmly.  \"You're trying to get my  secret, and I won't let you.\"    The eyes of the other eagle flashed angrily, but Ruggedo did not dare  insist.  If he offended this boy, he might have to remain an eagle  always and he wouldn't like that.  Some day he hoped to be able to  learn the secret word of the magical transformations, but just now he  must let Kiki have his own way.    \"All right,\" he said gruffly; \"do as you please.\"    So Kiki flew to a tree that was far enough distant so that Ruggedo  could not overhear him and said: \"I want Ruggedo, the Nome, and myself  to have the heads of lions, the bodies of monkeys, the wings of eagles  and the tails of wild asses, with knobs of gold on the ends of them  instead of bunches of hair--Pyrzqxgl!\"    He pronounced the magic word in the proper manner and at once his form  changed to the one he had described.  He spread his eagle's wings and  finding they were strong enough to support his monkey body and lion  head he flew swiftly to the tree where he had left Ruggedo.  The Nome  was also transformed and was climbing down the tree because the  branches all around him were so thickly entwined that there was no room  between them to fly.    Kiki quickly joined his comrade and it did not take them long to reach  the ground.          8.  The Li-Mon-Eags Make Trouble      There had been trouble in the Forest of Gugu that morning.  Chipo the  Wild Boar had bitten the tail off Arx the Giraffe while the latter had  his head among the leaves of a tree, eating his breakfast.  Arx kicked  with his heels and struck Tirrip, the great Kangaroo, who had a new  baby in her pouch.  Tirrip knew it was the Wild Boar's fault, so she  knocked him over with one powerful blow and then ran away to escape  Chipo's sharp tusks.  In the chase that followed a giant porcupine  stuck fifty sharp quills into the Boar and a chimpanzee in a tree threw  a cocoanut at the porcupine that jammed its head into its body.    All this was against the Laws of the Forest, and when the excitement  was over, Gugu the Leopard King called his royal Counselors together to  decide how best to punish the offenders.    The four lords of the forest were holding solemn council in a small  clearing when they saw two strange beasts approaching them--beasts the  like of which they had never seen before.    Not one of the four, however, relaxed his dignity or showed by a  movement that he was startled.  The great Leopard crouched at full  length upon a fallen tree-trunk.  Bru the Bear sat on his haunches  before the King; Rango the Gray Ape stood with his muscular arms  folded, and Loo the Unicorn reclined, much as a horse does, between his  fellow-councillors.  With one consent they remained silent, eyeing with  steadfast looks the intruders, who were making their way into their  forest domain.    \"Well met, Brothers!\" said one of the strange beasts, coming to a halt  beside the group, while his comrade with hesitation lagged behind.    \"We are not brothers,\" returned the Gray Ape, sternly.  \"Who are you,  and how came you in the forest of Gugu?\"    \"We are two Li-Mon-Eags,\" said Ruggedo, inventing the name.  \"Our home  is in Sky Island, and we have come to earth to warn the forest beasts  that the people of Oz are about to make war upon them and enslave them,  so that they will become beasts of burden forever after and obey only  the will of their two-legged masters.\"    A low roar of anger arose from the Council of Beasts.    \"WHO'S going to do that?\" asked Loo the Unicorn, in a high, squeaky  voice, at the same time rising to his feet.    \"The people of Oz,\" said Ruggedo.    \"But what will WE be doing?\" inquired the Unicorn.    \"That's what I've come to talk to you about.\"    \"You needn't talk!  We'll fight the Oz people!\" screamed the Unicorn.  \"We'll smash 'em; we'll trample 'em; we'll gore 'em; we'll--\"    \"Silence!\" growled Gugu the King, and Loo obeyed, although still  trembling with wrath.  The cold, steady gaze of the Leopard wandered  over the two strange beasts.  \"The people of Oz,\" said he, \"have not  been our friends; they have not been our enemies.  They have let us  alone, and we have let them alone.  There is no reason for war between  us.  They have no slaves.  They could not use us as slaves if they  should conquer us.  I think you are telling us lies, you strange  Li-Mon-Eag--you mixed-up beast who are neither one thing nor another.\"    \"Oh, on my word, it's the truth!\" protested the Nome in the beast's  shape.  \"I wouldn't lie for the world; I--\"    \"Silence!\" again growled Gugu the King; and somehow, even Ruggedo was  abashed and obeyed the edict.    \"What do you say, Bru?\" asked the King, turning to the great Bear, who  had until now said nothing.    \"How does the Mixed Beast know that what he says is true?\" asked the  Bear.    \"Why, I can fly, you know, having the wings of an Eagle,\" explained the  Nome.  \"I and my comrade yonder,\" turning to Kiki, \"flew to a grove in  Oz, and there we heard the people telling how they will make many ropes  to snare you beasts, and then they will surround this forest, and all  other forests, and make you prisoners.  So we came here to warn you,  for being beasts ourselves, although we live in the sky, we are your  friends.\"    The Leopard's lip curled and showed his enormous teeth, sharp as  needles.  He turned to the Gray Ape.    \"What do YOU think, Rango?\" he asked.    \"Send these mixed beasts away, Your Majesty,\" replied the Gray Ape.  \"They are mischief-makers.\"    \"Don't do that--don't do that!\" cried the Unicorn, nervously.  \"The  stranger said he would tell us what to do.  Let him tell us, then.  Are  we fools, not to heed a warning?\"    Gugu the King turned to Ruggedo.    \"Speak, Stranger,\" he commanded.    \"Well,\" said the Nome, \"it's this way: The Land of Oz is a fine  country.  The people of Oz have many good things--houses with soft  beds, all sorts of nice-tasting food, pretty clothes, lovely jewels,  and many other things that beasts know nothing of.  Here in the dark  forests the poor beasts have hard work to get enough to eat and to find  a bed to rest in.  But the beasts are better than the people, and why  should they not have all the good things the people have?  So I propose  that before the Oz people have the time to make all those ropes to  snare you with, that all we beasts get together and march against the  Oz people and capture them.  Then the beasts will become the masters  and the people their slaves.\"    \"What good would that do us?\" asked Bru the Bear.    \"It would save you from slavery, for one thing, and you could enjoy all  the fine things of Oz people have.\"    \"Beasts wouldn't know what to do with the things people use,\" said the  Gray Ape.    \"But this is only part of my plan,\" insisted the Nome.  \"Listen to the  rest of it.  We two Li-Mon-Eags are powerful magicians.  When you have  conquered the Oz people we will transform them all into beasts, and  send them to the forests to live, and we will transform all the beasts  into people, so they can enjoy all the wonderful delights of the  Emerald City.\"    For a moment no beast spoke.  Then the King said: \"Prove it.\"    \"Prove what?\" asked Ruggedo.    \"Prove that you can transform us.  If you are a magician transform the  Unicorn into a man.  Then we will believe you.  If you fail, we will  destroy you.\"    \"All right,\" said the Nome.  \"But I'm tired, so I'll let my comrade  make the transformation.\"    Kiki Aru had stood back from the circle, but he had heard all that was  said.  He now realized that he must make good Ruggedo's boast, so he  retreated to the edge of the clearing and whispered the magic word.    Instantly the Unicorn became a fat, chubby little man, dressed in the  purple Gillikin costume, and it was hard to tell which was the more  astonished, the King, the Bear, the Ape or the former Unicorn.    \"It's true!\" shorted the man-beast.  \"Good gracious, look what I am!  It's wonderful!\"    The King of Beasts now addressed Ruggedo in a more friendly tone.    \"We must believe your story, since you have given us proof of your  power,\" said he.  \"But why, if you are so great a magician, cannot you  conquer the Oz people without our help, and so save us the trouble?\"    \"Alas!\" replied the crafty old Nome, \"no magician is able to do  everything.  The transformations are easy to us because we are  Li-Mon-Eags, but we cannot fight, or conquer even such weak creatures  as the Oz people.  But we will stay with you and advise and help you,  and we will transform all the Oz people into beasts, when the time  comes, and all the beasts into people.\"    Gugu the King turned to his Counselors.    \"How shall we answer this friendly stranger?\" he asked.    Loo the former Unicorn was dancing around and cutting capers like a  clown.    \"On my word, your Majesty,\" he said, \"this being a man is more fun than  being a Unicorn.\"    \"You look like a fool,\" said the Gray Ape.    \"Well, I FEEL fine!\" declared the man-beast.    \"I think I prefer to be a Bear,\" said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#7)"],[1,"of much  distinction, one of whom, Ada Negri, had and still has great popularity.  Her last book of poems, \"Il libro Di Mara\" (\"The Book of Mara\"), has  shown that she still has the capacity to put into verse dramatically and  lyrically the most delicate and the most dominant notes of love as she  or as those she has loved has experienced it. She was born in a little  village of Lombardy in 1870. Her mother worked in a factory, and she  herself was for some years a teacher in the elementary schools; so she  had first-hand knowledge of the shut-in life of those whose repressions  and aspirations she sung and published in _L'Illustrazione Popolare_ of  Milan. In these she set forth with great sincerity and with stirring  lyric quality the sordid sufferings and sorrows of the toiling masses.  These poems and others were published under the titles of \"Fatality\" and  \"The Tempest\" in 1892 and 1894. Two years later a radical change in her  social and spiritual environment was brought about by her marriage to  Signor Garlanda, and soon she sang of it in a volume called \"Maternity,\"  which does for that state what her previous volumes had done for human  pain and human poverty. \"Dal Profondo\" (\"From the Depths\") was but a  continuation of these sentiments, tinctured with philosophical and  socialistic knowledge that had been displayed for other purpose in \"The  Tempest.\" After this came a volume entitled \"Esilio\" (\"Exile\"), which  reflected the same thoughts and sentiments in Swiss light. She has  written two prose works, a series of short stories entitled \"Le  Solitarie\" and \"Orazioni\" (\"Orisons\"). She glorifies purity, idealizes  it, and sings its adoration.    In the closing years of the century there was published in Milan a  volume of lyrics by one Annie Vivanti, which was praised intemperately  by Carducci and by the _Nuova Antologia_. She had some fiction to her  credit which dealt chiefly with the life of the stage, but her advent  into the world of letters was like a shooting star; nothing was known of  her origin save that she was said to have been born in London, and there  was some mystery about her career. In her poetry there was a true lyric  wail, especially in \"Destino\" (\"Destiny\"), \"Non Sara mai\" (\"It Can Never  Be\"), that appealed tremendously to the public mind. Had she been  productive she might have been compared to Ella Wheeler Wilcox. After  her marriage to Mr. Chartres, a London journalist, she became better  known as the mother of a child-wonder violinist. Amongst her romances  the one which had greatest popularity was entitled \"I Divoratori\" (\"The  Devourers\"). It is obviously the story of her life and of her daughter's  career, the record of filial shortcomings steeped in wormwood.    The third of these interesting writers, half Armenian, half Italian, was  Vittoria Aganoor, who was born in Padua in 1855. In 1900 she published a  volume called \"Leggenda Eterna\" (\"Eternal Legend\"), which showed her to  be a sincere, impassioned artist with a pronounced leaning toward the  sentimental. She died in London in the spring of 1910, after a surgical  operation, and a few hours later her husband, Guido Pompili, killed  himself. Her best-known poems are \"Il Canto dell' Ironia\" (\"The Song of  Irony\"), \"La vecchia Anima sogna ... \" (\"The Old Soul Dreams\"), \"Mama,  sei tu?\" (\"Mother, Is It Thou?\"). A complete volume of her poetry was  published in 1912.    Italians are astonished when women make a great stir in the world. They  have had no Jeanne d'Arc or Florence Nightingale. Their historic women  have been mostly mystics who would punish the flesh that they might  become spiritually pure, but the generation that is now passing has had  five women, four at least of whom will have to be discussed by any  historian of the intellectual movement in the latter half of the  nineteenth century. They are Matilde Serao, Grazia Deledda, Maria  Montessori, Eusapia Palladino, and Eleanora Duse, and most space will be  given to Duse.    Matilde Serao is the Marie Corelli of Italy with one important  qualification. She has not been obliged to subscribe to the rigors of  convention. She has spoken with great frankness about whole sides of  life which Miss Corelli knows, but about which she has been compelled to  be silent. Not that the romances of Matilde Serao are in any sense  pornographic, but she has painted her subjects so vividly and registered  her sensations and impressions so sumptuously that they are considered  very improper by Mrs. Grundy. She was in turn school-teacher,  telegraphist, journalist, publisher, author, but throughout her writings  she has kept the note of the journalist who has made a careful study of  Zola and of Flaubert. Her thought is spontaneous, her expression facile,  as she depicts the emotions and \"feelings\" of her Neapolitan characters,  clad in rags or royal raiment, living in hovel or in palace.    Her most successful books were \"La Storia di un Monaco,\" \"Il Ventre di  Napoli\" (\"The Belly of Naples\"), \"Il Paese della Cuccagna\" (\"The Land of  the Cockaigne\"), and \"Terno secco\" in which the social, economic, and  political world of Naples is revealed. With the third of those  enumerated she tried to do for lottery-gambling in Naples what Charles  Dickens did for the private schools of England. Regrettably her efforts  did not have a similar result.    In her Neapolitan stories the local color is not a mere background, but  the very marrow of their being, with the result that it is almost  impossible to reproduce it adequately in translation. Her later books  were always pictures of the professional lover in different  environments. He loves with fury and usually for a short time only. His  amatory conduct has no ancillae of Anglo-Saxon love-making. It is taurine  and satyric. He does not always kill after the embrace, but one gathers  from his conduct that he would like to do so. Time has tempered Matilde  Serao's erotic literary coefficient and her last books are cool, more  serene, and less interesting. One of her last books, \"Ella non rispose,\"  has recently been translated into English under the title of \"Souls  Divided.\"    Grazia Deledda has done for her native island of Sardinia that which  Signora Serao did for Naples, but to a great extent she kept lubricity  out of her writings. In her \"Il Vecchio della Montagna\" (\"The Old Man of  the Mountain\"), \"La Via del Male\" (\"Road to Evil\"), \"Cenere\" (\"Ashes\"),  \"Nostalgia,\" \"L'Incendio nell' Uliveto\" (\"The Burning in the Olive  Grove\"), and many others, she depicted with wondrous accuracy the life,  feelings, struggles, ambitions, infirmities of the Sardinians, and  painted their sordid surroundings and glorious scenery. She did for that  wonderful island, so strangely neglected by the mother country, what  Mary Wilkins did for New England. Her imagination was never so vivid nor  was her eye so penetrating as that of her Neapolitan sister, nor has she  known the voluptuous side of life, seamy or embroidered, but she has  known how to put down in a way that engrosses the reader's attention the  pitiable and pathetic plights that circumstance and passion force upon  the people with whom she lives. The display of their passions and  sorrows are apparently as familiar to her as the landscapes.  Unfortunately, however, she does for them that which she does for the  latter. She idealizes them or, better said, she strains them through her  imagination. In other words, instead of recording them as they are she  records them as they should be. Her novels give the impression of being  photographic until you read Verga. Not that the breath of insincerity  which Croce said was the curse of Italy's modern writers comes from her.  She is most sincere, but her characters are sandman manikins into whose  nostrils she has breathed the breath of life. She makes her characters  do what she might do if she were one of them.    Whether she is tugging at the end of her intellectual tether or not  remains to be seen, but her recent work has not the spontaneity and  imaginativeness of her earlier books and she is almost obsessed with  describing landscapes, the advent and departure of the sun, and  stage-settings generally. Her last story, \"The Burning in the Olive  Grove,\" is a conflict between the present and the past, and turns upon a  marriage of convention. It gives the author the opportunity to depict  the imperious eighty-three-year-old grandmother, her useless brother,  the farm lassie whose worldly success in marrying into a family above  her station she owes to her beauty, and a pillar of feminine virtue who  would live her own life in her own way despite the schemings of the  grandmother of feudalistic behavior. The scene is filled with character  studies which she likes so well: the old soldier of Garibaldi's legion,  his lame son whom the heroine loves, and virtuous heroic peasantry.    Several of Grazia Deledda's novels have been translated into English,  but they have not had great success. She is one of the last of the  realistic idealizers. The most her admirers can hope that the future  will do for her is that it will suggest to those in search of Sardinian  color that they should consult her writings. Neither the psychologist  nor the literary craftsman will disturb her literary remains.    The most promising successor of these women novelists is Clarice  Tartufari, whose \"Rete d'Acciaio\" (\"Nets of Steel\") is a powerful though  painful study of the Sicilian brand of jealousy.    Arturo Graf (1848-1918), for many years a professor in the University of  Turin, was a materialistic poet whose productions during his lifetime  were received with some favor and are now being given high rating.  Fifteen years ago a very flattering review of his dramatic poems,  especially \"Medusa,\" appeared in the _Nuova Antologia_, and recently  Signor Vittorio Gian has published in _Gazetta di Torino_ an analysis of  his mental processes and an estimate "]]]
