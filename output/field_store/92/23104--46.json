It was strange to see that the good shrank not from the wicked, nor  were the sinners abashed by the saints. Scattered also among their  pale-faced enemies were the Indian priests, or powwows, who had often  scared their native forest with more hideous incantations than any  known to English witchcraft.    \"But where is Faith?\" thought Goodman Brown; and, as hope came into his  heart, he trembled.    Another verse of the hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain, such as  the pious love, but joined to words which expressed all that our nature  can conceive of sin, and darkly hinted at far more. Unfathomable to  mere mortals is the lore of fiends. Verse after verse was sung; and  still the chorus of the desert swelled between like the deepest tone of  a mighty organ; and with the final peal of that dreadful anthem there  came a sound, as if the roaring wind, the rushing streams, the howling  beasts, and every other voice of the unconcerted wilderness were  mingling and according with the voice of guilty man in homage to the  prince of all. The four blazing pines threw up a loftier flame, and  obscurely discovered shapes and visages of horror on the smoke wreaths  above the impious assembly. At the same moment the fire on the rock  shot redly forth and formed a glowing arch above its base, where now  appeared a figure. With reverence be it spoken, the figure bore no  slight similitude, both in garb and manner, to some grave divine of the  New England churches.    \"Bring forth the converts!\" cried a voice that echoed through the field  and rolled into the forest.    At the word, Goodman Brown stepped forth from the shadow of the trees  and approached the congregation, with whom he felt a loathful  brotherhood by the sympathy of all that was wicked in his heart. He  could have well-nigh sworn that the shape of his own dead father  beckoned him to advance, looking downward from a smoke wreath, while a  woman, with dim features of despair, threw out her hand to warn him  back. Was it his mother? But he had no power to retreat one step, nor  to resist, even in thought, when the minister and good old Deacon  Gookin seized his arms and led him to the blazing rock. Thither came  also the slender form of a veiled female, led between Goody Cloyse,  that pious teacher of the catechism, and Martha Carrier, who had  received the devil's promise to be queen of hell. A rampant hag was  she. And there stood the proselytes beneath the canopy of fire.    \"Welcome, my children,\" said the dark figure, \"to the communion of your  race. Ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny. My  children, look behind you!\"    They turned; and flashing forth, as it were, in a sheet of flame, the  fiend worshippers were seen; the smile of welcome gleamed darkly on  every visage.    \"There,\" resumed the sable form, \"are all whom ye have reverenced from  youth. Ye deemed them holier than yourselves, and shrank from your own  sin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and prayerful  aspirations heavenward. Yet here are they all in my worshipping  assembly. This night it shall be granted you to know their secret  deeds: how hoary-bearded elders of the church have whispered wanton  words to the young maids of their households; how many a woman, eager  for widows' weeds, has given her husband a drink at bedtime and let him  sleep his last sleep in her bosom; how beardless youths have made haste  to inherit their fathers' wealth; and how fair damsels--blush not,  sweet ones--have dug little graves in the garden, and bidden me, the  sole guest to an infant's funeral. By the sympathy of your human hearts  for sin ye shall scent out all the places--whether in church,  bedchamber, street, field, or forest--where crime has been committed,  and shall exult to behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, one  mighty blood spot. Far more than this. It shall be yours to penetrate,  in every bosom, the deep mystery of sin, the fountain of all wicked  arts, and which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than human  power--than my power at its utmost--can make manifest in deeds. And  now, my children, look upon each other.\"    They did so; and, by the blaze of the hell-kindled torches, the  wretched man beheld his Faith, and the wife her husband, trembling  before that unhallowed altar.    \"Lo, there ye stand, my children,\" said the figure, in a deep and  solemn tone, almost sad with its despairing awfulness, as if his once  angelic nature could yet mourn for our miserable race. \"Depending upon  one another's hearts, ye had still hoped that virtue were not all a  dream. Now are ye undeceived. Evil is the nature of mankind. Evil must  be your only happiness. Welcome again, my children, to the communion of  your race.\"    \"Welcome,\" repeated the fiend worshippers, in one cry of despair and  triumph.    And there they stood, the only pair, as it seemed, who were yet  hesitating on the verge of wickedness in this dark world. A basin was  hollowed, naturally, in the rock. Did it contain water, reddened by the  lurid light? or was it blood? or, perchance, a liquid flame? Herein did  the shape of evil dip his hand and prepare to lay the mark of baptism  upon their foreheads, that they might be partakers of the mystery of  sin, more conscious of the secret guilt of others, both in deed and  thought, than they could now be of their own. The husband cast one look  at his pale wife, and Faith at him. What polluted wretches would the  next glance show them to each other, shuddering alike at what they  disclosed and what they saw!    \"Faith! Faith!\" cried the husband, \"look up to heaven, and resist the  wicked one.\"    Whether Faith obeyed he knew not. Hardly had he spoken when he found  himself amid calm night and solitude, listening to a roar of the wind  which died heavily away through the forest. He staggered against the  rock, and felt it chill and damp; while a hanging twig, that had been  all on fire, besprinkled his cheek with the coldest dew.    The next morning young Goodman Brown came slowly into the street of  Salem village, staring around him like a bewildered man. The good old  minister was taking a walk along the graveyard to get an appetite for  breakfast and meditate his sermon, and bestowed a blessing, as he  passed, on Goodman Brown. He shrank from the venerable saint as if to  avoid an anathema. Old Deacon Gookin was at domestic worship, and the  holy words of his prayer were heard through the open window. \"What God  doth the wizard pray to?\" quoth Goodman Brown. Goody Cloyse, that  excellent old Christian, stood in the early sunshine at her own  lattice, catechizing a little girl who had brought her a pint of  morning's milk. Goodman Brown snatched away the child as from the grasp  of the fiend himself. Turning the corner by the meeting-house, he spied  the head of Faith, with the pink ribbons, gazing anxiously forth, and  bursting into such joy at sight of him that she skipped along the  street and almost kissed her husband before the whole village. But  Goodman Brown looked sternly and sadly into her face, and passed on  without a greeting.    Had Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest and only dreamed a wild  dream of a witch-meeting?    Be it so if you will; but, alas! it was a dream of evil omen for young  Goodman Brown. A stern, a sad, a darkly meditative, a distrustful, if  not a desperate man did he become from the night of that fearful dream.  On the Sabbath day, when the congregation were singing a holy psalm, he  could not listen because an anthem of sin rushed loudly upon his ear  and drowned all the blessed strain. When the minister spoke from the  pulpit with power and fervid eloquence, and, with his hand on the open  Bible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and of saint-like lives  and triumphant deaths, and of future bliss or misery unutterable, then  did Goodman Brown turn pale, dreading lest the roof should thunder down  upon the gray blasphemer and his hearers. Often, waking suddenly at  midnight, he shrank from the bosom of Faith; and at morning or  eventide, when the family knelt down at prayer, he scowled and muttered  to himself, and gazed sternly at his wife, and turned away. And when he  had lived long, and was borne to his grave a hoary corpse, followed by  Faith, an aged woman, and children and grandchildren, a goodly  procession, besides neighbors not a few, they carved no hopeful verse  upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom.        RAPPACCINI'S DAUGHTER [From the Writings of Aubepine.]    We do not remember to have seen any translated specimens of the  productions of M. de l'Aubepine--a fact the less to be wondered at, as  his very name is unknown to many of his own countrymen as well as to  the student of foreign literature. As a writer, he seems to occupy an  unfortunate position between the Transcendentalists (who, under one  name or another, have their share in all the current literature of the  world) and the great body of pen-and-ink men who address the intellect  and sympathies of the multitude. If not too refined, at all events too  remote, too shadowy, and unsubstantial in his modes of development to  suit the taste of the latter class, and yet too popular to satisfy the  spiritual or metaphysical requisitions of the former, he must  necessarily find himself without an audience, except here and there an  individual or possibly an isolated clique. His writings, to do them  justice, are not altogether destitute of fancy and originality; they  might have won him greater reputation but for an inveterate love of  allegory, which is apt to invest his plots and characters with the  aspect of scenery and people in the clouds, and to steal away the human  warmth out of his conceptions. His fictions are sometimes historical,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51233"],[0,"The Marching Morons (#7)"],[1,"Mexico--who by fair means or foul may seek to  wrest from Columbia's grasp the torch of freedom of space; nations  whose low living standards and innate depravity give them an unfair  advantage over the citizens of our fair republic.    \"This is my program: I suggest that a city of more than 100,000  population be selected by lot. The citizens of the fortunate city  are to be awarded choice lands on Venus free and clear, to have and  to hold and convey to their descendants. And the national government  shall provide free transportation to Venus for these citizens. And this  program shall continue, city by city, until there has been deposited on  Venus a sufficient vanguard of citizens to protect our manifest rights  in that planet.    \"Objections will be raised, for carping critics we have always with  us. They will say there isn't enough steel. They will call it a cheap  giveaway. I say there _is_ enough steel for _one_ city's population to  be transferred to Venus, and that is all that is needed. For when the  time comes for the second city to be transferred, the first, emptied  city can be wrecked for the needed steel! And is it a giveaway? Yes! It  is the most glorious giveaway in the history of mankind! Mr. President  and gentlemen, there is no time to waste--Venus must be American!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Black-Kupperman, at the Pole, opened his eyes and said feebly, \"The  style was a little uneven. Do you think anybody'll notice?\"    \"You did fine, boy; just fine,\" Barlow reassured him.    Hull-Mendoza's bill became law.    Drafting machines at the South Pole were busy around the clock and the  Pittsburgh steel mills spewed millions of plates into the Los Alamos  spaceport of the Evening Star Travel and Real Estate Corporation. It  was going to be Los Angeles, for logistic reasons, and the three most  accomplished psycho-kineticists went to Washington and mingled in the  crowd at the drawing to make certain that the Los Angeles capsule  slithered into the fingers of the blind-folded Senator.    Los Angeles loved the idea and a forest of spaceships began to blossom  in the desert. They weren't very good space ships, but they didn't have  to be.    A team at the Pole worked at Barlow's direction on a mail setup. There  would have to be letters to and from Venus to keep the slightest  taint of suspicion from arising. Luckily Barlow remembered that the  problem had been solved once before--by Hitler. Relatives of persons  incinerated in the furnaces of Lublin or Majdanek continued to get  cheery postal cards.           *       *       *       *       *    The Los Angeles flight went off on schedule, under tremendous press,  newsreel and television coverage. The world cheered the gallant  Angelenos who were setting off on their patriotic voyage to the land  of milk and honey. The forest of spaceships thundered up, and up, and  out of sight without untoward incident. Billions envied the Angelenos,  cramped and on short rations though they were.    Wreckers from San Francisco, whose capsule came up second, moved  immediately into the city of the angels for the scrap steel their own  flight would require. Senator Hull-Mendoza's constituents could do no  less.    The president of Mexico, hypnotically alarmed at this extension of  _yanqui imperialismo_ beyond the stratosphere, launched his own  Venus-colony program.    Across the water it was England versus Ireland, France versus Germany,  China versus Russia, India versus Indonesia. Ancient hatreds grew into  the flames that were rocket ships assailing the air by hundreds daily.        Dear Ed, how are you? Sam and I are fine and hope you are fine. Is      it nice up there like they say with food and close grone on trees?      I drove by Springfield yesterday and it sure looked funny all the      buildings down but of coarse it is worth it we have to keep the      greasers in their place. Do you have any truble with them on Venus?      Drop me a line some time. Your loving sister, Alma.        Dear Alma, I am fine and hope you are fine. It is a fine place here      fine climate and easy living. The doctor told me today that I seem      to be ten years younger. He thinks there is something in the air      here keeps people young. We do not have much trouble with the      greasers here they keep to theirselves it is just a question of us      outnumbering them and staking out the best places for the Americans.      In South Bay I know a nice little island that I have been saving      for you and Sam with lots of blanket trees and ham bushes. Hoping      to see you and Sam soon, your loving brother, Ed.    Sam and Alma were on their way shortly.    Poprob got a dividend in every nation after the emigration had passed  the halfway mark. The lonesome stay-at-homes were unable to bear the  melancholy of a low population density; their conditioning had been to  swarms of their kin. After that point it was possible to foist off the  crudest stripped-down accommodations on would-be emigrants; they didn't  care.    Black-Kupperman did a final job on President Hull-Mendoza, the last  job that genius of hypnotics would ever do on any moron, important or  otherwise.    Hull-Mendoza, panic-stricken by his presidency over an emptying nation,  joined his constituents. The _Independence_, aboard which traveled  the national government of America, was the most elaborate of all the  spaceships--bigger, more comfortable, with a lounge that was handsome,  though cramped, and cloakrooms for Senators and Representatives. It  went, however, to the same place as the others and Black-Kupperman  killed himself, leaving a note that stated he \"couldn't live with my  conscience.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The day after the American President departed, Barlow flew into a rage.  Across his specially built desk were supposed to flow all Poprob  high-level documents and this thing--this outrageous thing--called  Poprob_term_ apparently had got into the executive stage before he had  even had a glimpse of it!    He buzzed for Rogge-Smith, his statistician. Rogge-Smith seemed to be  at the bottom of it. Poprobterm seemed to be about first and second and  third derivatives, whatever they were. Barlow had a deep distrust of  anything more complex than what he called an \"average.\"    While Rogge-Smith was still at the door, Barlow snapped, \"What's the  meaning of this? Why haven't I been consulted? How far have you people  got and why have you been working on something I haven't authorized?\"    \"Didn't want to bother you, Chief,\" said Rogge-Smith. \"It was really  a technical matter, kind of a final cleanup. Want to come and see the  work?\"    Mollified, Barlow followed his statistician down the corridor.    \"You still shouldn't have gone ahead without my okay,\" he grumbled.  \"Where the hell would you people have been without me?\"    \"That's right, Chief. We couldn't have swung it ourselves; our minds  just don't work that way. And all that stuff you knew from Hitler--it  wouldn't have occurred to us. Like poor Black-Kupperman.\"    They were in a fair-sized machine shop at the end of a slight upward  incline. It was cold. Rogge-Smith pushed a button that started a motor,  and a flood of arctic light poured in as the roof parted slowly. It  showed a small spaceship with the door open.           *       *       *       *       *    Barlow gaped as Rogge-Smith took him by the elbow and his other boys  appeared: Swenson-Swenson, the engineer; Tsutsugimushi-Duncan, his  propellants man; Kalb-French, advertising.    \"In you go, Chief,\" said Tsutsugimushi-Duncan. \"This is Poprobterm.\"    \"But I'm the world Dictator!\"    \"You bet, Chief. You'll be in history, all right--but this is  necessary, I'm afraid.\"    The door was closed. Acceleration slammed Barlow cruelly to the metal  floor. Something broke and warm, wet stuff, salty-tasting, ran from his  mouth to his chin. Arctic sunlight through a port suddenly became a  fierce lancet stabbing at his eyes; he was out of the atmosphere.    Lying twisted and broken under the acceleration, Barlow realized that  some things had not changed, that Jack Ketch was never asked to dinner  however many shillings you paid him to do your dirty work, that murder  will out, that crime pays only temporarily.    The last thing he learned was that death is the end of pain."]]]
