In addition to this demonstration, we have given anthropological  and statistical proofs of the fundamental distinction between  habitual and occasional criminals, which had been pointed out by  many observers, but which had hitherto remained a simple assertion  without manifest consequences.    This same distinction ought to be not only the basis of all  sociological theory concerning crime, but also a point of  departure for other distinctions more precise and complete, which  I set forth in my previous studies on criminals, and which were  subsequently reproduced, with more or less of assent, by all  criminal sociologists.    In the first place, it is necessary to distinguish, amongst  habitual criminals, those who present a conspicuous and clinical  form of mental aberration, which accounts for their anti-social  activity.  <p 24>    In the second place, amongst habitual criminals who are not of  unsound mind, however little the inmates of prisons may have been  observed with adequate ideas and experience, there is a clear  indication of a class of individuals, physically or mentally  abnormal, induced to crime by inborn tendencies, which are  manifest from their birth, and accompanied by symptoms of extreme  moral insensibility.  Side by side with these, another class  challenges attention, of individuals who have also been criminals  from childhood, and who continue to be so, but who are in a  special degree a product of physical and social environment, which  has persistently driven them into the criminal life, by their  abandonment before and after the first offence, and which,  especially in the great towns, is very often forced upon them by  the actual incitement of their parents.    Amongst occasional criminals, again, a special category is created  by a kind of exaggeration of the characteristics, mainly  psychological, of the type itself.  In the case of all occasional  criminals, the crime is brought about rather by the effects of  environment than by the active tendencies of the individual; but  whilst in most of these individuals the deciding cause is only a  circumstance affecting all alike, with a few it is an exceptional  constraint of passion, a sort of psychological tempest, which  drives them into crime.    Thus, then, the entire body of criminals may be classed in five  categories, which as early as 1880 I described as criminal madmen,  born criminals, <p 25>criminals by contracted habits, occasional  criminals, and criminals of passion.    As already observed, criminal anthropology will not finally  establish itself until it has been developed by biological,  psychological, and statistical monographs on each of these  categories, in such a manner as to present their anthropological  characteristics with greater precision than they have hitherto  attained.  So far, observers continue to give us the same  characteristics for a large aggregate of criminals, classifying  them according to the form of their crime rather than according to  their bio-social type.  In Lombroso's work, for instance, or in  that of Marro (and to some extent even in my work on homicide),  the characteristics are stated for a total, or for legal  categories of criminals, such as murderers, thieves, forgers, and  so on, which include born criminals, occasional and habitual  criminals, and madmen.  The result is a certain measure of  inconsistency, according to the predominance of one type or the  other in the aggregate of criminals under observation.  This also  contributes to render the conclusions of criminal anthropology  less evident.    Nevertheless, we may sum up the inquiries which have been made up  to the present time; and in particular we may now point out the  general characteristics of the five classes of criminals, in  accordance with my personal experience in the observation of  criminals.  It is to be hoped that successive observations of a  more methodical kind will gradually reinforce the accuracy of this  classification of symptoms.  <p 26>    In the first place, it is evident that in a classification not  exclusively biological, if it is to form the anthropological basis  of criminal sociology, criminals of unsound mind must in all  fairness be included.    The usual objection, recently repeated by M. Joly (``Le Crime,''  p. 62), which holds the term ``criminal madness'' to be self-  contradictory, since a madman is not morally responsible, and  therefore cannot be a criminal, is not conclusive.  We maintain  that responsibility to society, the only responsibility common to  all criminals, exists also for criminals of unsound mind.    Nor, again, is it correct to say, with M. Bianchi, that mad  criminals should be referred to psychiatry, and not to criminal  anthropology; for, though psychiatry is concerned with mad  criminals in a psycho-pathological sense, this does not prevent  criminal anthropology and sociology from also concerning  themselves with the same subjects, in order to constitute the  natural history of the criminal, and to suggest remedies in the  interest of society.    As for criminals of unsound mind, it is necessary to begin by  placing in a separate category such as cannot, after the studies  of Lombroso and the Italian school of psychiatry, be distinguished  from the born criminals properly so-called.  These are the persons  tainted with a form of insanity which is known under various  names, from the ``moral insanity'' of Pritchard to the ``reasoning  madness'' of Verga.  Moral insanity, illustrated by the works of  Mendel, Legrand du Saulle, Maudsley, Krafft-Ebing, Savage, Hugues,  <p 27>Hollander, Tamburini, Bonvecchiato, which, with the lack or  atrophy of the moral or social sense, and of _*apparent_ soundness  of mind, is properly speaking only the essential psychological  condition of the born criminal.    Beyond these morally insane people, who are very rare--for, as  Krafft-Ebing and Lombroso have pointed out, they are found more  frequently in prisons than in mad-houses--there is the unhappily  large body of persons tainted by a common and clinical form of  mental alienation, all of whom are apt to become criminal.    The whole of these criminals of unsound mind cannot be included in  a single category; and such, indeed, is the opinion expressed by  Lombroso, in the second volume of the fourth edition of his work,  after his descriptive analysis of the chief forms of mental  alienation.  As a matter of fact, not only are the organic, and  especially the psychological, characteristics of criminal madmen  sometimes identical with and sometimes opposed to those of born  and occasional criminals, but these very characteristics vary  considerably between the different forms of mental alienation, in  spite of the identity of the crime committed.    It is further to be observed, in respect of criminal madmen, that  this category also includes all the intermediary types between  complete madness and a rational condition, who remain in what  Maudsley has called the ``middle zone.''  The most frequent  varieties in the criminality of these partially insane persons, or  ``matto<i:>des,'' are the perpetrators of <p 28>attacks upon  statesmen, who are generally men with a grievance, irascible men,  writers of insane documents, and the like, such as Passanante,  Guiteau, and Maclean.    In the same category are those who commit terrible crimes without  motive, and who nevertheless, according to the complacent  psychology of the classical school, would be credited with a  maximum of moral soundness.    Again, there are the necrophiles, like Sergeant Bertrand, Verzeni,  Menesclou, and very probably the undetected ``Jack the Ripper'' of  London, who are tainted with a form of sexual psychopathy.  Yet  again there are such as are tainted with hereditary madness, and  especially the epileptics and epileptoids, who may also be  assigned to the class of born criminals, according to the  plausible hypothesis of Lombroso as to the fundamental identity of  congenital criminality, moral madness, and epilepsy.  I have  always found in my own experience that outrageous murders, not to  be explained according to the ordinary psychology of criminals,  are accompanied by psychical epilepsy, or larvea.      Born or instinctive criminals are those who most frequently  present the organic and psychological characteristics established  by criminal anthropology.  These are either savage or brutal men,  or crafty and idle, who draw no distinction between homicide,  robbery or other kinds of crime, and honest industry.  ``They are  criminals just as others are good workingmen,'' says Fr<e'>gier;  and, as Romagnosi put it, actual <p 29>punishment affects them  much less than the menace of punishment, or does not affect them  at all, since they regard imprisonment as a natural risk of their  occupation, as masons regard the fall of a roof, or as miners  regard fire-damp.  ``They do not suffer in prison.  They are like  a painter in his studio, dreaming of their next masterpiece.  They  are on good terms with their gaolers, and even know how to make  themselves useful.''[5]      [5] Moreau, ``Souvenirs de la petite et grande Roquette,'' Paris,  1884, ii. 440.        The born criminals and the occasional criminals constitute the  majority of the characteristic and diverse types of homicide and  thief.  Prison governors call them ``gaol-birds.''  They pass on  from the police to the judge and to the prison, and from the  prison to the police and to the judge, with a regularity which has  not yet impaired the faith of law-makers in the efficacy of  punishment as a cure for crime.[6]      [6] Wayland, ``The Incorrigible,'' in the _Journal of Mental  Science_, 1888.
