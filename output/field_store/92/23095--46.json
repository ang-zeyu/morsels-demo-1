General remarks on perspective (40-41).    40.    ON PAINTING.    Perspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.    [Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]    41.    The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat  appear in relief and what is in relief flat.    The elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).    42.    All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of  mathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the  superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the  point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is  to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.  The line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has  neither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,  excepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is  the junction of two lines in a point.    43.    A point is not part of a line.    44.    OF THE NATURAL POINT.    The smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,  and this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any  thing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the  mathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.    [Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on  parchment of the well-known _\"Trattato d'Architettura civile e  militare\"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the  author says: _'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della  quale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]    45.    1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the  limitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation  of one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part  of any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.    If one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of  an infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite  number of lines, there must be an infinite number of points  separable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;  whence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.    46.    The point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies  no space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the  beginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called  nothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The  limitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the  surface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that  body.    Of the line (47-48).    47.    DEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.    The line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather  be called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its  nature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines  may be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has  no dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be  called) of one single line.    HOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?    An angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an  angle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight  line, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,  smaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.    48.    OF DRAWING OUTLINE.    Consider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every  object, and the character of their undulations. And these  undulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are  composed of arched convexities or angular concavities.    49.    The nature of the outline.    The boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The  proposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is  a surface, which is not part of the body contained within that  surface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the  medium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its  place. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line  forming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible  thickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with  lines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;  for not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but  their parts will be invisible from distance.    50.    Definition of Perspective.    [Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a  thorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function  simply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of  all the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there  is no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where  these pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend  the lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will  bring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must  form a pyramid.]    [Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied  to the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit  their image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is  the name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and  edges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single  point.]    [Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may  practically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own  image, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]    Perspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms  that every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;  and bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or  smaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one  from the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from  the surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance  meet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no  dimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye  receives all the points of the cone.    [Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The  paragraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are  evidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;  but they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]    51.    IN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.    The perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.    Supposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let  the small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be  the pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of  the eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,  passing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in  the pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil  having received the objects, by means of the light, immediately  refers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.  And you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the  intellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it  by means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by  the line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen  by the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not  coincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,  shown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye  will be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot  discern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in  the line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a  pyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,  in the centre of the pupil, as figured above.    [Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and  immovable; this is plain from line 11.]    Experimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).    52.    Perspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,  that all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of  lines.    By a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the  edges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet  in a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will  show to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all  objects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;  therefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being  indivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than  this point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines  which come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if  any man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in  this point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the  middle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could  never diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or  of oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger  than the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be  seen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the  lines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within  these lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by  distance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by  it. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself  one single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge  of the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.  Let _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50133"],[0,"The Dunwich Horror (#7)"],[1,"wed,  uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had  occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen  to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of  ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of  the cattle, only about a quarter could be found and identified. Some of  these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot.  Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but  others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a  branch that hovered about half-way between soundness and decadence,  made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practised on  the hilltops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his  memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether  connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.    Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize  for real defense. In a few cases closely related families would band  together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but, in general there  was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a  futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks  handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and  when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had  gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed  an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture  to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.    When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was  less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and  the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague  sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror  a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill.  As before, the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the  blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation  of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the  moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along  the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed  shrubbery and saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when  they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the  inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony  cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed  around to the hill's summit by safer routes they saw that the trail  ended--or rather, reversed--there.    It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and  chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and  Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the center of a vast space  thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly  concave surface was a thick fetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness  observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror  escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down  the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same  as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and  normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who  was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or  suggested a plausible explanation.    Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily.  The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual  persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 a. m. all the party  telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers  heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, \"Help, oh, my Gawd!...\" and some  thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation.  There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew  till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called  everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The  truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed  men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was  horrible, yet hardly a surprize. There were more swaths and monstrous  prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an  egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be  discovered--only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had  been erased from Dunwich.      8    In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of  the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of  a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of  Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation,  had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages  both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general  resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being  absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of  the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet,  giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of  cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied  on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used.  The ancient books taken from Whateley's quarters, while absorbingly  interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible  lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no  assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with  an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet--this one of a very  different cast, and resembling Sanskrit more than anything else. The  old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage,  both because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and  because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical  formulæ of antiquity and the Middle Ages.    Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically  used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times,  and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of  the Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital;  since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if,  as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It  was his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the  writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech  than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulæ and incantations.  Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption  that the bulk of it was in English.    Dr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that  the riddle was a deep and complex one, and that no simple mode of  solution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified  himself with the massed lore of cryptography, drawing upon the fullest  resources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the  arcana of Trithemius' _Poligraphia_, Giambattista Porta's _De Furtivis  Literarum Notis_, De Vigenere's _Traité des Chiffres_, Falconer's  _Cryptomenysis Patefacta_, Davys' and Thicknesse's Eighteenth Century  treatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten,  and Klüber's _Kryptographik_. He interspersed his study of the books  with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced  that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of  cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are  arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with  arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities  seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded  that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt  handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several  times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen  obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear.  Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged  definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was  indeed in English.    On the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and  Dr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur  Whateley's annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and  it was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition  and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the  first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November  26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he  remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of  twelve or thirteen.
