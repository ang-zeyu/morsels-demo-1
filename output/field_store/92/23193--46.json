Answer--and for once in thy long, useless, and evil  life, let it be in the words of truth and sincerity,--hast thou such  a coach?--is it in rerum natura?--or is this base annunciation a mere  swindle on the incautious to beguile them of their time, their patience,  and three shillings of sterling money of this realm?--Hast thou, I say,  such a coach? ay or no?\"    \"O dear, yes, sir; the neighbours ken the diligence weel, green picked  oat wi' red--three yellow wheels and a black ane.\"    \"Woman, thy special description will not serve--it may be only a lie with  a circumstance.\"    \"O, man, man!\" said the overwhelmed Mrs. Macleuchar, totally exhausted  at having been so long the butt of his rhetoric, \"take back your three  shillings, and make me quit o' ye.\"    \"Not so fast, not so fast, woman--Will three shillings transport me to  Queensferry, agreeably to thy treacherous program?--or will it requite  the damage I may sustain by leaving my business undone, or repay the  expenses which I must disburse if I am obliged to tarry a day at the  South Ferry for lack of tide?--Will it hire, I say, a pinnace, for which  alone the regular price is five shillings?\"    Here his argument was cut short by a lumbering noise, which proved to  be the advance of the expected vehicle, pressing forward with all the  dispatch to which the broken-winded jades that drew it could possibly  be urged. With ineffable pleasure, Mrs. Macleuchar saw her tormentor  deposited in the leathern convenience; but still, as it was driving off,  his head thrust out of the window reminded her, in words drowned amid  the rumbling of the wheels, that, if the diligence did not attain the  Ferry in time to save the flood-tide, she, Mrs. Macleuchar, should be  held responsible for all the consequences that might ensue.    The coach had continued in motion for a mile or two before the stranger  had completely repossessed himself of his equanimity, as was manifested  by the doleful ejaculations, which he made from time to time, on the too  great probability, or even certainty, of their missing the flood-tide.  By degrees, however, his wrath subsided; he wiped his brows, relaxed his  frown, and, undoing the parcel in his hand, produced his folio, on which  he gazed from time to time with the knowing look of an amateur, admiring  its height and condition, and ascertaining, by a minute and individual  inspection of each leaf, that the volume was uninjured and entire  from title-page to colophon. His fellow-traveller took the liberty  of inquiring the subject of his studies. He lifted up his eyes with  something of a sarcastic glance, as if he supposed the young querist  would not relish, or perhaps understand, his answer, and pronounced  the book to be Sandy Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale,* a book  illustrative of the Roman remains in Scotland.    * Note B. Sandy Gordon's Itinerarium.    The querist, unappalled by this learned title, proceeded to put  several questions, which indicated that he had made good use of a good  education, and, although not possessed of minute information on the  subject of antiquities, had yet acquaintance enough with the classics to  render him an interested and intelligent auditor when they were enlarged  upon. The elder traveller, observing with pleasure the capacity of  his temporary companion to understand and answer him, plunged, nothing  loath, into a sea of discussion concerning urns, vases, votive, altars,  Roman camps, and the rules of castrametation.    The pleasure of this discourse had such a dulcifying tendency, that,  although two causes of delay occurred, each of much more serious  duration than that which had drawn down his wrath upon the unlucky Mrs.  Macleuchar, our =Antiquary= only bestowed on the delay the honour of  a few episodical poohs and pshaws, which rather seemed to regard the  interruption of his disquisition than the retardation of his journey.    The first of these stops was occasioned by the breaking of a spring,  which half an hour's labour hardly repaired. To the second, the  Antiquary was himself accessory, if not the principal cause of it; for,  observing that one of the horses had cast a fore-foot shoe, he apprized  the coachman of this important deficiency. \"It's Jamie Martingale that  furnishes the naigs on contract, and uphauds them,\" answered John, \"and  I am not entitled to make any stop, or to suffer prejudice by the like  of these accidents.\"    \"And when you go to--I mean to the place you deserve to go to, you  scoundrel,--who do you think will uphold you on contract? If you don't  stop directly and carry the poor brute, to the next smithy, I'll have  you punished, if there's a justice of peace in Mid-Lothian;\" and,  opening the coach-door, out he jumped, while the coachman obeyed his  orders, muttering, that \"if the gentlemen lost the tide now, they could  not say but it was their ain fault, since he was willing to get on.\"    I like so little to analyze the complication of the causes which  influence actions, that I will not venture to ascertain whether our  Antiquary's humanity to the poor horse was not in some degree aided by  his desire of showing his companion a Pict's camp, or Round-about,  a subject which he had been elaborately discussing, and of which a  specimen, \"very curious and perfect indeed,\" happened to exist about a  hundred yards distant from the spot where this interruption took place.  But were I compelled to decompose the motives of my worthy friend (for  such was the gentleman in the sober suit, with powdered wig and slouched  hat), I should say, that, although he certainly would not in any case  have suffered the coachman to proceed while the horse was unfit for  service, and likely to suffer by being urged forward, yet the man of  whipcord escaped some severe abuse and reproach by the agreeable mode  which the traveller found out to pass the interval of delay.    So much time was consumed by these interruptions of their journey, that  when they descended the hill above the Hawes (for so the inn on the  southern side of the Queensferry is denominated), the experienced eye  of the Antiquary at once discerned, from the extent of wet sand, and  the number of black stones and rocks, covered with sea-weed, which were  visible along the skirts of the shore, that the hour of tide was past.  The young traveller expected a burst of indignation; but whether, as  Croaker says in \"The Good-natured Man,\" our hero had exhausted himself  in fretting away his misfortunes beforehand, so that he did not feel  them when they actually arrived, or whether he found the company in  which he was placed too congenial to lead him to repine at anything  which delayed his journey, it is certain that he submitted to his lot  with much resignation.    \"The d--l's in the diligence and the old hag, it belongs to!--Diligence,  quoth I? Thou shouldst have called it the Sloth--Fly, quoth she? why, it  moves like a fly through a glue-pot, as the Irishman says. But, however,  time and tide tarry for no man, and so, my young friend, we'll have a  snack here at the Hawes, which is a very decent sort of a place,  and I'll be very happy to finish the account I was giving you of the  difference between the mode of entrenching castra stativa and castra  aestiva, things confounded by too many of our historians. Lack-a-day, if  they had ta'en the pains to satisfy their own eyes, instead of following  each other's blind guidance!--Well! we shall be pretty comfortable at the  Hawes; and besides, after all, we must have dined somewhere, and it will  be pleasanter sailing with the tide of ebb and the evening breeze.\"    In this Christian temper of making the best of all occurrences, our  travellers alighted at the Hawes.          CHAPTER SECOND.                  Sir, they do scandal me upon the road here!                  A poor quotidian rack of mutton roasted                  Dry to be grated! and that driven down                With beer and butter-milk, mingled together.                  It is against my freehold, my inheritance.                Wine is the word that glads the heart of man,                And mine's the house of wine. Sack, says my bush,               Be merry and drink Sherry, that's my posie.                          Ben Jonson's New Inn.    As the senior traveller descended the crazy steps of the diligence at  the inn, he was greeted by the fat, gouty, pursy landlord, with that  mixture of familiarity and respect which the Scotch innkeepers of the  old school used to assume towards their more valued customers.    \"Have a care o' us, Monkbarns (distinguishing him by his territorial  epithet, always most agreeable to the ear of a Scottish proprietor), is  this you? I little thought to have seen your honour here till the summer  session was ower.\"    \"Ye donnard auld deevil,\" answered his guest, his Scottish accent  predominating when in anger though otherwise not particularly  remarkable,--\"ye donnard auld crippled idiot, what have I to do with the  session, or the geese that flock to it, or the hawks that pick their  pinions for them?\"    \"Troth, and that's true,\" said mine host, who, in fact, only spoke upon  a very general recollection of the stranger's original education, yet  would have been sorry not to have been supposed accurate as to the  station and profession of him, or any other occasional guest--\"That's  very true,--but I thought ye had some law"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#7)"],[1,"_part of speech_ is _much?_ +P+.--An  adjective. +T+.--What then is _too?_ +P+.--An adverb.    +T+.--Why is _too_ in the first sentence an adverb? Why is _too_ in the  second sentence an adverb? Why is _hastily_ an adverb?    Let the teacher use the following and similar examples, and continue the  questions. _He thinks so. So much time has been wasted_.    Let the teacher give verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and require the pupils  to modify them by appropriate adverbs.    +DEFINITION.--_An Adverb_ is a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or  an adverb+.    Analysis and Parsing.    Analyze, diagram, and parse the following sentences.    +Model+.--_We have been very agreeably disappointed_. +Diagram+ as in.  Lesson 25.    For +Written Parsing+, use _Model_, Lesson 22, adding a column for adverbs.    +Oral Parsing+.--_We_ is a pronoun, because----; _have been disappointed_  is a verb, because----; _very_ is an _adverb_, because it is joined to the  adverb _agreeably_ to tell how agreeably; _agreeably_ is an _adverb_,  because it is joined to the verb _have been disappointed_ to indicate  manner.    1. The plough-boy plods homeward.  2. The water gushed forth.  3. Too much time was wasted.  4. She decided too hastily.  5. You should listen more attentively.  6. More difficult sentences must be built.  7. An intensely painful operation was performed.  8. The patient suffered intensely.  9. That story was peculiarly told.  10. A peculiarly interesting story was told.  11. An extravagantly high price was paid.  12. That lady dresses extravagantly.    The pupil will notice that, in some of the examples above, the same adverb  modifies an adjective in one sentence and an adverb in another, and that,  in other examples, an adjective and a verb are modified by the same word.  You may learn from this why such modifiers are grouped into one class.          LESSON 28.    ANALYSIS AND PARSING.    MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES FOR REVIEW.    1. You must diagram neatly.  2. The sheaves are nearly gathered.  3. The wheat is duly garnered.  4. The fairies were called together.  5. The birds chirp merrily.  6. This reckless adventurer has returned.  7. The wild woods rang.  8. White fleecy clouds are floating above.  9. Those severe laws have been repealed.  10. A republican government was established.  11. An unusually large crop had just been harvested.  12. She had been waiting quite patiently.  13. A season so extremely warm had never before been known.  14. So brave a deed [Footnote: _Can be commended_ is the verb, and _not_ is      an adverb.] cannot be too warmly commended.          LESSON 29.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES FOR REVIEW.    Build sentences containing the following adverbs.    Hurriedly, solemnly, lightly, well, how, somewhere, abroad, forever,  seldom, exceedingly.    Using the following subjects and predicates as foundations, build six  sentences having modified subjects and modified predicates, two of which  shall contain adverbs modifying adjectives; two, adverbs modifying adverbs;  and two, adverbs modifying verbs.    1. ------- boat glides -----.  2. ------- cloud is rising -----.  3. ------- breezes are blowing -----.  4. ------- elephant was captured -----.  5. ------- streams flow -----.  6. ------- spring has opened -----.    We here give you, in classes, the material out of which you are to build  five sentences with modified subjects and modified predicates.    Select the subject and the predicate first.    _Nouns and  Pronouns.      Verbs.        Adjectives.   Adverbs_.    branch       | was running | large, that | lustily  coach        | were played | both, the   | downward  they         | cried       | all, an     | very  we           | is growing  | several, a  | rapidly  games        | cheered     | amusing     | not, loudly, then          LESSON 30.    ERRORS FOR CORRECTION.    +To the Teacher+.--We here suggest additional work in composition, with  particular reference to the choice and position of adjectives. See Notes,  pp. 171,172.    +_Caution_+.--When two or more adjectives are used with a noun, care must  be taken in their arrangement. If there is any difference in their relative  importance, place nearest the noun the one that is most intimately  connected with it.    +To the Teacher+.--We have in mind here those numerous cases where one  adjective modifies the noun, and the second modifies the noun as limited by  the first. _All ripe apples are picked_. Here _ripe_ modifies _apples_, but  _all_ modifies _apples_ limited by _ripe_. Not _all apples_ are _picked_,  but only _all_ that are _ripe_.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS OF POSITION.      A wooden pretty bowl stood on the table.    The blue beautiful sky is cloudless.    A young industrious man was hired.    The new marble large house was sold.    +_Caution_+.--When the adjectives are of the _same_ rank, place them where  they will sound the best. This will usually be in the order of their  length--the longest last.    CORRECT THESE ERRORS.      An entertaining and fluent speaker followed.    An enthusiastic, noisy, large crowd was addressed.    +_Caution_+.--Do not use the pronoun +_them_+ for the adjective +_those_+.    CORRECT THESE ERRORS.      Them books are nicely bound.    Them two sentences should be corrected.    CORRECT THE FOLLOWING MISCELLANEOUS ERRORS.      arouse, o romans    hear, o israel    it is i    i may be Mistaken    you Have frequently been warned    some Very savage beasts have been Tamed    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    What is an adverb? Give an example of an adverb modifying an adjective; one  modifying a verb; one modifying an adverb. Why are such expressions as _a  wooden pretty bowl_ faulty? Why is _an enthusiastic, noisy, large crowd_  faulty? Why is _them books_ wrong? Why is _i may be Mistaken_ wrong? Why is  _hear, o israel_, wrong? Study the Review Questions given in previous  Lessons.    +To the Teacher+.--See COMPOSITION EXERCISES in the Supplement--Selection  from Darwin.          LESSON 31.    PHRASES INTRODUCED BY PREPOSITIONS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--In the preceding Lessons, you have learned  that several words may be grouped together and used as one modifier. In the  examples given, the principal word is joined directly to the subject or to  the predicate, and this word is modified by another word. In this Lesson  also groups of words are used as modifiers, but these words are not united  with one another, or with the word which the group modifies, just as they  are in the preceding Lessons. I will write on the board this sentence: _De  Soto marched into Florida_. +T+.--What tells where De Soto marched?  +P+.--_Into Florida_. +T+.--What is the principal word of the group?  +P+.--_Florida_. +T+.--Is _Florida_ joined directly to the predicate, as  rapidly was in Lesson 25? +P+.--No. +T+.--What little word comes in to  unite the modifier to _marched?_ +P+.--_Into_. +T+.--Does _Florida_ alone,  tell where he marched? +P+.--No. +T+.--Does _into_ alone, tell where he  marched? +P+.--No.    +T+.--These groups of related words are called +Phrases+. Let the teacher  draw on the board the diagram of the sentence above.    Phrases of the form illustrated in this diagram are the most common, and  they perform a very important function in our language.    Let the teacher frequently call attention to the fact that all the words of  a phrase are _taken together_ to perform _one distinct office_.    A phrase modifying the subject is equivalent to an adjective, and,  frequently, may be changed into one. _The dew of the morning has passed  away_. What word may be used for the phrase _of the morning?_  +P+.--_Morning_. +T+.--Yes. The _morning_ dew has passed away.    A phrase modifying the predicate is equivalent to an adverb, and,  frequently, may be changed into one. _We shall go to that place_. What word  may be used for the phrase, _to that place?_ +P+.--_There_. +T+.--Yes. We  shall go _there_.    Change the phrases in these sentences:---    _A citizen of America was insulted.    We walked toward home_.    Let the teacher write on the board the following words, and require the  pupils to add to each, one or more words to complete a phrase, and then to  construct a sentence in which the phrase may be properly employed: _To,  from, by, at, on, with, in, into, over_.      +DEFINITION.--A _Phrase_ is a group of words denoting related ideas but not  expressing a thought+.    Analysis and Parsing.    Analyze the following sentences, and parse the nouns, pronouns, adjectives,  verbs, and adverbs.    Model.--_The finest trout in the lake are generally caught in the deepest  water_.        trout       |    are caught  ================|================  \\The \\finest \\in     \\generally  \\in                \\                   \\                 \\ lake              \\ water                  ------              ----------                    \\the                \\the  \\deepest    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--You will notice that the diagram of the  _phrase_ is made up of a slanting line, standing for the introductory and  connecting word, and a horizontal line, representing the principal word.  Under the latter, are placed the little slanting lines standing for the  modifiers of the principal word. Here and elsewhere all modifiers are  joined to their principal words by slanting lines.    +Oral Analysis+.--This is a sentence, because ------; _trout_ is the  subject, because -----; _are caught_ is the predicate, because ------; the  words _The_ and _finest_, and the phrase, _in the lake_, are modifiers of  the subject, because -----; the word _generally_ and the phrase, _in the  deepest water_, are modifiers of the predicate, because ------; _in_  introduces the first phrase, and _lake_ is the principal word; _in_  introduces the second phrase, and _water_ is the principal word; _the_ and  _deepest_ are modifiers of _water_; _The finest trout in the lake_ is the  modified subject, and _are"]]]
