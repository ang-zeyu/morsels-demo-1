[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#7)"],[1,"by Sidney Rigdon and Thomas B. Marsh, then President of  the Twelve Apostles, visited Canada. The course of the Prophet was in  marked contrast with that of the self-sufficient high priest, Sampson  Avard. The latter at once assumed the presidency of the churches, and  commenced regulating affairs without consulting or even seeing Elder  Taylor; the former, though acknowledged and sustained as the President  of the Church in all the world, and Prophet, Seer and Revelator  thereto, called for him, and would not move in any business concerning  the churches in Canada until he had seen him. Although Elder Taylor was  some distance from Toronto, the Prophet sent for him, and patiently  awaited his coming. On his arrival, to the great surprise of Elder  Taylor, the Prophet began to counsel with him as to the best mode of  procedure in relation to holding some conferences during their visit.  Elder Taylor told the prophet that Elder Avard was presiding. It was  Joseph's turn to be surprised now. Avard had never been sent to preside  in Canada by his consent. Elder Taylor told him of the credentials that  Avard had presented from the high priests' quorum. Joseph insisted that  there must be some mistake; an imposition had been practiced, at which  he was much annoyed.    Obtaining a carriage, Elder Taylor accompanied the Prophet and his  associates in visiting the churches. \"This was as great a treat to me  as I ever enjoyed,\" he remarks. \"I had daily opportunity of conversing  with them, of listening to their instructions, and in participating  in the rich stores of intelligence that flowed continually from the  Prophet Joseph.\"    A conference was held in the County of Whitby, in a large barn owned by  Edward Lawrence, which was numerously attended. The spirit of God was  present, the hearts of the Saints were made to rejoice, and many who  were out of the Church believed.    Another conference was held in Scarboro with similar results. At the  latter conference Doctor Avard was present, and the Prophet reproved  him severely for coming to that place with fictitious papers. He  also censured Elder Taylor for yielding up his office on so flimsy a  pretext; but palliated it on account of his youth and inexperience. He  gave him a strict charge never again, on any account, to give up any  office or calling unless he received orders from a legitimate source  that could be relied upon; otherwise he would be held responsible for  any evil that might accrue from it. The apostate party at Kirtland had  appointed Doctor Avard to supercede Elder Taylor. They remembered the  fearless speech the latter had made in Kirtland, in the early spring,  and doubtless thought it to their interest to have a man presiding in  Canada who was less staunch in his friendship for the Prophet than he.  [1]    Before the Prophet and his companions left Canada, they ordained Elder  Taylor a High Priest, on the 21st of August, 1837, and reappointed him  to preside over the Churches.    The work spread rapidly on every hand in Canada. The Lord labored with  His servants, confirming their words by signs following the believers.  The sick were healed; and many possessed the spirit of prophecy. Among  the latter was a boy living in Toronto, who, shortly after his baptism,  prophesied that the people of Canada would soon have war, and that  armed men would arrive in the city of Toronto on a steamer, and stack  their arms on the wharf.    As at that time their was no prospect whatever of war, many of the  enemies of the Church laughed at what they called the impertinence of  the young prophet. The prophecy however was fulfilled.    At that time Canada was divided into two Provinces, Upper and Lower  Canada. A governor was appointed by the English crown, for each  province, and to assist him in his duties there was also appointed an  executive council. In addition to these executive officers there was  a legislative council, appointed by the crown, and an assembly, the  members of which were elected by the people. This latter body formed  the lower branch of the provincial legislature, and the former the  higher.    For years the people had petitioned the British government for the  abolishment of the executive council, and demanded that the legislative  council be made elective. The British Parliament refused these  alterations in the Canadian constitution, whereupon one Mackenzie, the  leader of a party that had urged complete separation from the British  government, considered the times ripe for a revolution, and suddenly  assembled five hundred men at Montgomery's tavern, four miles from  Toronto, with a view of attacking that town. The loyalists as suddenly  assembled to defend the town, and a few days later defeated the rebels  in an open engagement. Mackenzie escaped to Buffalo, in the United  States, and there succeeded in kindling a great enthusiasm for the  cause of his party; and in a short time returned to Canada and mustered  into service over a thousand men.    He took up a position on Navy Island, situated in the Niagara Channel.  Fortifications were commenced which were defended by thirteen cannon,  and for a time the insurgents baffled all attempts of the government to  dislodge them. The uprising, however, was finally suppressed.    It was during this rebellion that all the terms of the young prophet's  predictions were fulfilled. War broke out as he had said it would;  and during the time it existed, troops entered Toronto harbor, were  disembarked and stacked their arms on the wharf. Elder Taylor and his  wife witnessed the arrival of the ships, the landing of the troops, and  saw them stack their arms on the wharf.    Speaking of prophecy, it may be well to state here that the remarkable  prophecy of Heber C. Kimball on the head of Parley P. Pratt was  literally fulfilled. He found a people in Canada prepared to receive  the gospel; they assisted him to sufficient means to relieve him  from his temporal embarrassments: his wife, contrary to all natural  prospects, bore him a son, though she died at his birth; and from  Canada the work of the Lord spread into England in the following manner:    At the request of Elder Joseph Fielding, Elder Taylor wrote a letter  to his brother, a minister in the town of Preston, England, giving  an account of the restoration of the gospel through the ministration  of angels to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This was doubtless the first  announcement of these things in England, by an authorized servant of  God.    Subsequently, in this same year, 1837, Elder Fielding accompanied  Apostles Kimball and Hyde to England; and it was in his brother's  chapel, in Preston, that Apostle Heber C. Kimball preached the first  public discourse, in this dispensation, on the gospel in that land.    Footnotes    1. It may not be out of place to remark here that this Doctor Avard was  the same man who, two years later, in Missouri, took it upon himself  to organize a band of men whom he called \"Danites.\" In this, as in  the matter above related, he ran without being sent, and the affair  ended in his disgrace. He intimated with an air of mystery, when  organizing the Danite band in Missouri, that he had been appointed, by  the heads of the Church, to perform some important work of a secret  character, and at last put the men, whom he had inveigled into his  secret meetings, under fearful oaths not to reveal the nature of his  work. This done he revealed to the captains of the organization his  plans; and to their surprise he proposed a bold scheme of robbery and  plunder against the Gentiles. The brethren to whom he made known his  plans, were indignant, for they knew that the heads of the Church were  not standing behind any such thing as that, and reported the affair to  the Prophet. As soon as Avard's movements were thus made known, he was  promptly excommunicated; and the \"Danite\" movement was stifled at its  birth.        CHAPTER V.    APPOINTED TO COLLECT FUNDS IN CANADA--CALL TO THE  APOSTLESHIP--REFLECTIONS--PREPARES TO LEAVE CANADA FOR MISSOURI.    The spirit of apostasy so prevalent in Kirtland, in 1837 and 1838,  resulted in many prominent leaders being excommunicated from the  Church. Among those who fell in those dark days were a number of the  Twelve Apostles.    About the same time several business enterprises which the Saints  inaugurated at Kirtland, including a banking establishment, went down  before the wave of financial disaster which swept over the country; and  as the Presidency of the Church were heavily involved in consequence  of these failures, Elder Taylor was appointed to collect funds in  the district over which he presided, to relieve them from their  embarrassment. He accomplished this labor to the entire satisfaction of  the Presidency.    In the fall of 1837, Elder Taylor received word from the Prophet Joseph  that he would be chosen to fill one of the vacancies in the quorum of  Apostles. [1]    This call to the Apostleship, found Elder Taylor busily engaged in the  ministry. He had previously received a manifestation that he would be  called to that high office in the Church, but fearing that it might  be from the devil he wisely kept it hidden in his own breast. Now,  however, he had been chosen to that place by the voice of God through  His Prophet; but while his heart rejoiced at the thought that he was  known of the Lord, and considered worthy by Him to stand in this  exalted station in the Church of Christ, he bore his new honors with  becoming modesty. Commenting upon the appointment, and the prospect  which now opened before him, he remarks:    \"The work seemed great, the duties arduous and responsible. I felt my  own weakness and littleness; but I felt determined, the Lord being my  helper, to endeavor to magnify it. When I first entered upon Mormonism,  I did it with my eyes open. I counted the cost. I looked upon it as  a life-long labor, and I considered that I was not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#7)"],[1,"any advantage of him, Mr. Damon. He has  money lying idle, and he'd like to have you use it.\"    \"Well, Tom, I might use it, if I had only myself to think about.  But there's no use in throwing good money after bad. If I took  yours now this fellow Peters would only get it, and that would be  the last of it.\"    \"No, Tom, thank you and your father just the same, but I'll try to  weather the storm a bit longer myself. Then, if I do go down I  won't drag anybody else with me. I'll hang on to the wreck a bit  longer. The storm may blow over, or--or something may happen to  this fellow Peters.\"    \"Has he really got you in his grip, Mr. Damon?\"    \"He has, and, to a certain extent, it's my own fault. I should  have been suspicious of him. And now, Tom, let me give you a  further word of warning. You heard me say to steer clear of this  Peters?\"    \"Yes, and I'm going to. But I'm going to make him pay for damaging  my boat, if I possibly can.\"    \"Maybe it would be wiser not to try that, Tom. I tell you he's a  tricky man. And one thing more. I have heard that this man Peters  makes a specialty of organizing companies to take up new  inventions.\"    \"Is that so?\" asked Tom, interestedly.    \"Yes, but that's as far as it goes. Peters gets the invention, and  the man, out of whose brain it came, gets nothing.\"    \"In other words, he swindles them?\"    \"That's it, Tom. If not in one way, then in another. He cheats  them out of the profits of their inventions. So I want to warn you  to be on the lookout.\"    \"Don't worry,\" said Tom. \"Peters will get nothing from my father  or me. We'll be on our guard. Not that I think he will try it, but  it's just as well to be warned. I didn't like him from the moment  he ran into me, and, now that I know what he has done to you, I  like him still less. He won't get anything from me!\"    \"I'm glad to hear you say so, Tom. I wish he'd gotten nothing out  of me.\"    \"Are you sure you won't let my father help you, financially, Mr.  Damon?\"    \"No, Tom, at least not for the present. I'm going to make another  fight to hold on to my fortune. If I find I can't do it alone,  then I'll call on you. I'm real glad you called. Bless my  shoestring! I feel better now.\"    \"I'm glad of it,\" laughed Tom, and he saw that his friend was in a  better state of mind, as his \"blessings\" showed.    Tom remained for a little longer, talking to Mr. Damon, and then  took his leave, flying back home in the airship.    \"Gen'man t' see yo', Massa Tom,\" announced Eradicate, as he helped  Tom wheel the monoplane back into the shed.    \"Is that so, Rad? Where is he?\"    \"Settin' in th' library. Yo' father am out, so I asted him in  dere.\"    \"That's right, Rad. Who is he, do you know?\"    \"No, sah, Massa Tom, I doan't. He shore does use a pow'ful nice  perfume on his pocket hanky, though. Yum-yum!\"    \"Perfume!\" exclaimed Tom, his mind going back to the day he had  had the trouble with Mr. Peters. \"Is he a big, red-faced man,  Rad?\"    \"No, sah, Massa Tom. He's a white-faced, skinny man.\"    \"Then it can't be Peters,\" mused Tom. \"I guess perhaps it's that  lawyer I wrote to about bringing suit to get back what it cost me  to have the Kilo fixed. I'll see him at once. Oh, by the way, it  isn't Mr. Grant Halling; is it? The gentleman who got tangled up  in our aerials with his airship? Is it he?\"    \"No, sah, Massa Tom. 'Tain't him.\"    \"I thought perhaps he had gotten into more trouble,\" mused Tom, as  he took off his airship \"togs,\" and started for the house. For Mr.  Halling had called for his repaired airship some time ago, and had  promised to pay Tom another and more conventional visit, some  future day.    Tom did not know the visitor whom he greeted in the library a  little later. The man, as Eradicate had said, was rather pale of  face, and certainly he was not very fleshy.    \"Mr. Tom Swift, I think?\" said the man, rising and holding out his  hand.    \"That's my name. I don't believe I know you, though.\"    \"No, I haven't your reputation,\" said the man, with a laugh that  Tom did not like. \"We can't all be great inventors like you,\" and,  somehow, Tom liked the man less than before, for he detected an  undertone of sneering patronage in the words. Tom disliked praise,  and he felt that this was not sincere.    \"I have called on a little matter of business,\" went on the man.  \"My name is Harrison Boylan, and I represent Mr. Shallock Peters.\"    Instinctively Tom stiffened. Receiving a call from a  representative of the man against whom Mr. Damon had warned him  only a short time before was a strange coincidence, Tom thought.    \"You had some little accident, when your motor boat and that of  Mr. Peters collided, a brief time ago; did you not?\" went on Mr.  Boylan.    \"I did,\" said Tom, and, as he motioned the caller to be seated Tom  saw, with a start, that some of the drawings of his photo  telephone were lying on a desk in plain sight. They were within  easy reach of the man, and Tom thought the sheets looked as though  they had been recently handled. They were not in the orderly array  Tom had made of them before going out.    \"If he is a spy, and has been looking at them,\" mused Tom, \"he may  steal my invention.\" Then he calmed himself, as he realized that  he, himself, had not yet perfected his latest idea. \"I guess he  couldn't make much of the drawings,\" Tom thought.    \"Yes, the collision was most unfortunate,\" went on Mr. Boylan,  \"and Mr. Peters has instructed me to say--\"    \"If he's told you to say that it was my fault, you may as well  save your time,\" cut in Tom. \"I don't want to be impolite, but I  have my own opinion of the affair. And I might add that I have  instructed a lawyer to begin a suit against Mr. Peters--\"    \"No necessity for that at all!\" interrupted the man, in soft  accents. \"No necessity at all. I am sorry you did that, for there  was no need. Mr. Peters has instructed me to say that he realizes  the accident was entirely his own fault, and he is very willing--nay,  anxious, to pay all damages. In fact, that is why I am here,  and I am empowered, my dear Mr. Swift, to offer you five hundred  dollars, to pay for the repairs to your motor boat. If that is not  enough--\"    The man paused, and drew a thick wallet from his pocket. Tom felt  a little embarrassed over what he had said.    \"Oh,\" spoke the young inventor, \"the repair bill is only about  three hundred dollars. I'm sorry--\"    \"Now that's all right, Mr. Swift! It's all right,\" and the man,  with his soft words, raised a white, restraining hand. \"Not  another word. Mr. Peters did not know who you were that day he so  unfortunately ran into you. If he had, he would not have spoken as  he did. He supposed you were some amateur motor-boatist, and he  was--well, he admits it--he was provoked.\"    \"Since then he has made inquiries, and, learning who you were, he  at once authorized me to make a settlement in full. So if five  hundred dollars--\"    \"The repair bill,\" said Tom, and his voice was not very cordial,  in spite of the other's persuasive smile, \"the bill came to three  hundred forty-seven dollars. Here is the receipted bill. I paid  it, and, to be frank with you, I intended bringing suit against  Mr. Peters for that sum.\"    \"No need, no need at all, I assure you!\" interrupted Mr. Boylan,  as he counted off some bills. \"There you are, and I regret that  you and Mr. Peters had such a misunderstanding. It was all his  fault, and he wants to apologize to you.\"    \"The apology is accepted,\" said Tom, and he smiled a trifle. \"Also  the money. I take it merely as a matter of justice, for I assure  you that Mr. Peters's own machinist will say the accident was his  employer's fault.\"    \"No doubt of it, not the least in the world,\" said the caller.  \"And now that I have this disagreeable business over, let me speak  of something more pleasant.\"    Instinctively Tom felt that now the real object of the man's call  would be made plain--that the matter of paying the damages was  only a blind. Tom steeled himself for what was to come.    \"You know, I suppose,\" went on Mr. Boylan, smiling at Tom, \"that  Mr. Peters is a man of many and large interests.\"    \"I have heard something like that,\" said Tom, cautiously.    \"Yes. Well, he is an organizer--a promoter, if you like. He  supplies the money for large enterprises, and is, therefore, a  benefactor of the human race. Where persons have no cash with  which to exploit their--well, say their inventions. Mr. Peters  takes them, and makes money out of them.\"    \"No doubt,\" thought Tom, grimly.    \"In other cases, where an inventor is working at a handicap, say  with too many interests, Mr. Peters takes hold of one of his  ideas, and makes it pay much better than the inventor has been  able to do.\"    \"Now, Mr. Peters has heard of you, and he would like to do you  good.\"    \"Yes, I guess he would,\" thought Tom. \"He would like to do me--and  do me good and brown. Here's where I've got to play a game  myself.\"    \"And so,\" went on Mr. Boylan, \"Mr. Peters has sent me to you to  ask you to allow him to exploit one, or several, of your  inventions. He will form a large stock company, put one of your  inventions on the market, and make you a rich man. Now what do you  say?\" and he looked at Tom and smiled--smiled, the young inventor  could not help thinking, like a cat looking at a mouse. \"What do  you say, Mr. Swift?\"    For a moment Tom did not answer. Then getting up and opening the  library door, to indicate that the interview was at an end, the  young inventor smiled, and said:    \"Tell Mr. Peters that I thank him, but that I have nothing for him  to exploit, or with which to form a company to market.\"    \"Wha--what!\" faltered the visitor. \"Do you mean to say you will  not take advantage of his remarkable offer?\"    \"That's just what I mean to say,\" replied Tom, with a smile.    \"You won't do business with Mr. Peters? You won't let him do you  good?\"    \"No,\" said Tom,"]]]
