[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#7)"],[1," in Guiana, feeds in the marshy savanna  through which you have just passed. He is wary and shy, and will not  allow you to get within gunshot of him.    You sleep this night in the forest, and reach an Indian settlement  about three o'clock the next evening, after walking one-third of the  way through wet and miry ground.    But bad as the walking is through it, it is easier than where you cross  over the bare hills, where you have to tread on sharp stones, most of  them lying edgewise.    The ground gone over these two last days seems condemned to perpetual  solitude and silence. There was not one four-footed animal to be seen,  nor even the marks of one. It would have been as silent as midnight,  and all as still and unmoved as a monument, had not the jabiru in the  marsh and a few vultures soaring over the mountain's top shown that it  was not quite deserted by animated nature. There were no insects,  except one kind of fly about one-fourth the size of the common  house-fly. It bit cruelly, and was much more tormenting than the  mosquito on the sea-coast.    This seems to be the native country of the arrowroot. Wherever you  passed through a patch of wood in a low situation, there you found it  growing luxuriantly.    The Indian place you are now at is not the proper place to have come to  in order to reach the Portuguese frontiers. You have advanced too much  to the westward. But there was no alternative. The ground betwixt you  and another small settlement (which was the right place to have gone  to) was overflowed; and thus, instead of proceeding southward, you were  obliged to wind along the foot of the western hills, quite out of your  way.    But the grand landscape this place affords makes you ample amends for  the time you have spent in reaching it. It would require great  descriptive powers to give a proper idea of the situation these people  have chosen for their dwelling.    The hill they are on is steep and high, and full of immense rocks. The  huts are not all in one place, but dispersed wherever they have found a  place level enough for a lodgment. Before you ascend the hill you see  at intervals an acre or two of wood, then an open space with a few huts  on it; then wood again, and then an open space, and so on, till the  intervening of the western hills, higher and steeper still, and crowded  with trees of the loveliest shades, closes the enchanting scene.    At the base of this hill stretches an immense plain which appears to  the eye, on this elevated spot, as level as a bowling-green. The  mountains on the other side are piled one upon the other in romantic  forms, and gradually retire, till they are undiscernible from the  clouds in which they are involved. To the south-southwest this  far-extending plain is lost in the horizon. The trees on it, which look  like islands on the ocean, add greatly to the beauty of the landscape,  while the rivulet's course is marked out by the aeta-trees which follow  its meanders.    Not being able to pursue the direct course from hence to the next  Indian habitation, on account of the floods of water which fall at this  time of the year, you take a circuit westerly along the mountain's foot.    At last a large and deep creek stops your progress: it is wide and  rapid, and its banks very steep. There is neither curial nor canoe nor  purple-heart tree in the neighbourhood to make a wood-skin to carry you  over, so that you are obliged to swim across; and by the time you have  formed a kind of raft composed of boughs of trees and coarse grass to  ferry over your baggage, the day will be too far spent to think of  proceeding. You must be very cautious before you venture to swim across  this creek, for the alligators are numerous and near twenty feet long.  On the present occasion the Indians took uncommon precautions lest they  should be devoured by this cruel and voracious reptile. They cut long  sticks and examined closely the side of the creek for half a mile above  and below the place where it was to be crossed; and as soon as the  boldest had swum over he did the same on the other side, and then all  followed.    After passing the night on the opposite bank, which is well wooded, it  is a brisk walk of nine hours before you reach four Indian huts, on a  rising ground, a few hundred paces from a little brook whose banks are  covered over with coucourite- and aeta-trees.    This is the place you ought to have come to two days ago, had the water  permitted you. In crossing the plain at the most advantageous place you  are above ankle-deep in water for three hours; the remainder of the way  is dry, the ground gently rising. As the lower parts of this spacious  plain put on somewhat the appearance of a lake during the periodical  rains, it is not improbable but that this is the place which hath given  rise to the supposed existence of the famed Lake Parima, or El Dorado;  but this is mere conjecture.    A few deer are feeding on the coarse, rough grass of this far-extending  plain; they keep at a distance from you, and are continually on the  look-out.    The spur-winged plover and a species of the curlew, black with a white  bar across the wings, nearly as large again as the scarlet curlew on  the sea-coast, frequently rise before you. Here too the muscovy duck is  numerous, and large flocks of two other kinds wheel round you as you  pass on, but keep out of gunshot. The milk-white egrets and jabirus are  distinguished at a great distance, and in the aeta- and coucourite-trees  you may observe flocks of scarlet and blue aras feeding on the seeds.    It is to these trees that the largest sort of toucan resorts. He is  remarkable by a large black spot on the point of his fine yellow bill.  He is very scarce in Demerara, and never seen except near the sea-coast.    The ants' nests have a singular appearance on this plain; they are in  vast abundance on those parts of it free from water, and are formed of  an exceeding hard yellow clay. They rise eight or ten feet from the  ground, in a spiral form, impenetrable to the rain and strong enough to  defy the severest tornado.    The wourali poison procured in these last-mentioned huts seemed very  good, and proved afterwards to be very strong.    There are now no more Indian settlements betwixt you and the Portuguese  frontiers. If you wish to visit their fort, it would be advisable to  send an Indian with a letter from hence and wait his return. On the  present occasion a very fortunate circumstance occurred. The Portuguese  commander had sent some Indians and soldiers to build a canoe not far  from this settlement; they had just finished it, and those who did not  stay with it had stopped here on their return.    The soldier who commanded the rest said he durst not, upon any account,  convey a stranger to the fort: but he added, as there were two canoes,  one of them might be despatched with a letter, and then we could  proceed slowly on in the other.    About three hours from this settlement there is a river called  Pirarara, and here the soldiers had left their canoes while they were  making the new one. From the Pirarara you get into the River Maou, and  then into the Tacatou; and just where the Tacatou falls into the Rio  Branco there stands the Portuguese frontier-fort called Fort St.  Joachim. From the time of embarking in the River Pirarara it takes you  four days before you reach this fort.    There was nothing very remarkable in passing down these rivers. It is  an open country, producing a coarse grass and interspersed with clumps  of trees. The banks have some wood on them, but it appears stinted and  crooked, like that on the bleak hills in England.    The tapir frequently plunged into the river; he was by no means shy,  and it was easy to get a shot at him on land. The kessi-kessi paroquets  were in great abundance, and the fine scarlet aras innumerable in the  coucourite-trees at a distance from the river's bank. In the Tacatou  was seen the troupiale. It was charming to hear the sweet and plaintive  notes of this pretty songster of the wilds. The Portuguese call it the  nightingale of Guiana.    Towards the close of the fourth evening the canoe which had been sent  on with a letter met us with the commander's answer. During its absence  the nights had been cold and stormy, the rain had fallen in torrents,  the days cloudy, and there was no sun to dry the wet hammocks. Exposed  thus, day and night, to the chilling blast and pelting shower, strength  of constitution at last failed and a severe fever came on. The  commander's answer was very polite. He remarked, he regretted much to  say that he had received orders to allow no stranger to enter the  frontier, and this being the case he hoped I would not consider him as  uncivil: \"however,\" continued he, \"I have ordered the soldier to land  you at a certain distance from the fort, where we can consult together.\"    We had now arrived at the place, and the canoe which brought the letter  returned to the fort to tell the commander I had fallen sick.    The sun had not risen above an hour the morning after when the  Portuguese officer came to the spot where we had landed the preceding  evening. He was tall and spare, and appeared to be from fifty to  fifty-five years old; and though thirty years of service under an  equatorial sun had burnt and shrivelled up his face, still there was  something in it so inexpressibly affable and kind that it set you  immediately at your ease. He came close up to the hammock, and taking  hold of my wrist to feel the pulse, \"I am sorry, Sir,\" said he, \"to see  that the fever has taken such hold of you. You shall go directly with  me,\" continued he, \"to the fort; and though we have no doctor there, I  trust,\" added he, \"we shall soon bring you about again. The orders I  have received forbidding the admission of strangers were never intended  to be put in force against a sick English gentleman.\"    As the canoe was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#7)"],[1,"must be limited to noting the work  done, and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his  scientific aims, and which have been conspicuous in many of his  successors.    He studied in Germany, but King Frederick of Denmark, appreciating his  great talents, invited him to carry out his life's work in that  country. He granted to him the island of Hveen, gave him a pension,  and made him a canon of the Cathedral of Roskilde. On that island  Tycho Brahe built the splendid observatory which he called Uraniborg,  and, later, a second one for his assistants and students, called  Stjerneborg. These he fitted up with the most perfect instruments, and  never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations.[1]    The account of all these instruments and observations, printed at his  own press on the island, was published by Tycho Brahe himself, and the  admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of  design and the stability of his instruments.    His mechanical skill was very great, and in his workmanship he was  satisfied with nothing but the best. He recognised the importance of  rigidity in the instruments, and, whereas these had generally been  made of wood, he designed them in metal. His instruments included  armillae like those which had been used in Alexandria, and other  armillae designed by himself--sextants, mural quadrants, large  celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes. He  lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks. He invented  the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by  transversals somewhat in the way that Pedro Nunez had proposed.    He originated the true system of observation and reduction of  observations, recognising the fact that the best instrument in the  world is not perfect; and with each of his instruments he set to work  to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting, the  necessary correction being applied to each observation.    When he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was  confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and  rifle-shooting. The sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus  together, and a great deal depends on the form of sight. Tycho Brahe  invented, and applied to the pointers of his instruments, an  aperture-sight of variable area, like the iris diaphragm used now in  photography. This enabled him to get the best result with stars of  different brightness.  The telescope not having been invented, he  could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery.  This not  only removes the difficulty of focussing, but makes the minimum  visible angle smaller. Helmholtz has defined the minimum angle  measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc. In view of  this it is simply marvellous that, when the positions of Tycho's  standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues, his  probable error in right ascension is only +- 24\", 1, and in declination  only +- 25\", 9.    Clocks of a sort had been made, but Tycho Brahe found them so  unreliable that he seldom used them, and many of his position-measurements  were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars.    Taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a  clock, and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each  observation, we must all agree that Kepler, who inherited these  observations in MS., was justified, under the conditions then  existing, in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving  upon them.    In the year 1572, on November 11th, Tycho discovered in Cassiopeia a  new star of great brilliance, and continued to observe it until the  end of January, 1573. So incredible to him was such an event that he  refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he  saw. He made accurate observations of its distance from the nine  principal stars in Casseiopeia, and proved that it had no measurable  parallax. Later he employed the same method with the comets of 1577,  1580, 1582, 1585, 1590, 1593, and 1596, and proved that they too had  no measurable parallax and must be very distant.    The startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent, that  new stars may appear, and possibly that old ones may disappear, had  upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon  Hipparchus 1,700 years before. He felt it his duty to catalogue all  the principal stars, so that there should be no mistake in the  future. During the construction of his catalogue of 1,000 stars he  prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own  observations. Thus he eliminated (so far as naked eye observations  required) the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the  altitude of a star seem greater than it really is.    Tycho Brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations.  Copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope  of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation; and  he was not too ambitious, as his desire was to get the tables accurate  to ten minutes. Tycho Brahe found that the tables of Copernicus were  in error as much as two degrees. He re-discovered the inequality  called \"variation\" by observing the moon in all phases--a thing which  had not been attended to. [It is remarkable that in the nineteenth  century Sir George Airy established an altazimuth at Greenwich  Observatory with this special object, to get observations of the moon  in all phases.] He also discovered other lunar equalities, and wanted  to add another epicycle to the moon's orbit, but he feared that these  would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new  inequalities.    But, as it turned out, the most fruitful work of Tycho Brahe was on  the motions of the planets, and especially of the planet Mars, for it  was by an examination of these results that Kepler was led to the  discovery of his immortal laws.    After the death of King Frederick the observatories of Tycho Brahe  were not supported. The gigantic power and industry displayed by this  determined man were accompanied, as often happens, by an overbearing  manner, intolerant of obstacles. This led to friction, and eventually  the observatories were dismantled, and Tycho Brahe was received by the  Emperor Rudolph II., who placed a house in Prague at his disposal.  Here he worked for a few years, with Kepler as one of his assistants,  and he died in the year 1601.    It is an interesting fact that Tycho Brahe had a firm conviction that  mundane events could be predicted by astrology, and that this belief  was supported by his own predictions.    It has already been stated that Tycho Brahe maintained that  observation must precede theory. He did not accept the Copernican  theory that the earth moves, but for a working hypothesis he used a  modification of an old Egyptian theory, mathematically identical with  that of Copernicus, but not involving a stellar parallax.  He says  (_De Mundi_, etc.) that      the Ptolemean system was too complicated, and the new one which that    great man Copernicus had proposed, following in the footsteps of    Aristarchus of Samos, though there was nothing in it contrary to    mathematical principles, was in opposition to those of physics, as    the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move, and the system is    even opposed to the authority of Scripture. The absence of annual    parallax further involves an incredible distance between the    outermost planet and the fixed stars.    We are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case, so long  as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of  the solar system, his reasoning, as we should expect from such a man,  is practical and sound. It is not surprising, then, that astronomers  generally did not readily accept the views of Copernicus, that Luther  (Luther's _Tischreden_, pp.  22, 60) derided him in his usual pithy  manner, that Melancthon (_Initia doctrinae physicae_) said that  Scripture, and also science, are against the earth's motion; and that  the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals (who  wished to know whether Galileo was right or wrong) looked upon  Copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories.    Johann Kepler is the name of the man whose place, as is generally  agreed, would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who  have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge. He was born  at Wiel, in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, in 1571. He held an appointment  at Gratz, in Styria, and went to join Tycho Brahe in Prague, and to  assist in reducing his observations. These came into his possession  when Tycho Brahe died, the Emperor Rudolph entrusting to him the  preparation of new tables (called the Rudolphine tables) founded on  the new and accurate observations. He had the most profound respect  for the knowledge, skill, determination, and perseverance of the man  who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data; and though Tycho  hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working  as his assistant, and although there were disagreements between them,  Kepler held to his post, sustained by the conviction that, with these  observations to test any theory, he would be in a position to settle  for ever the problem of the solar system.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF JOHANNES KEPLER.  By F. Wanderer, from  Reitlinger's \"Johannes Kepler\" (original in Strassburg).]    It has seemed to many that Plato's demand for uniform circular motion  (linear or angular) was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good  work during fifteen hundred years, for a hundred ill-considered  speculative cosmogonies, for dissatisfaction, amounting to disgust,  with these _a priori_ guesses, and for the relegation of the  science to less intellectual races than Greeks and other"]]]
