It would  have been strange indeed if he had not been proud of the most humorous  creation in all fiction. He was proud, too, of the popularity and success  of the book, and beyond measure delightful is the naivete with which he  shows his pride in a dozen passages in the Second Part. But it was not  the success he coveted. In all probability he would have given all the  success of \"Don Quixote,\" nay, would have seen every copy of \"Don  Quixote\" burned in the Plaza Mayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega  was enjoying on an average once a week.    And so he went on, dawdling over \"Don Quixote,\" adding a chapter now and  again, and putting it aside to turn to \"Persiles and Sigismunda\"--which,  as we know, was to be the most entertaining book in the language, and the  rival of \"Theagenes and Chariclea\"--or finishing off one of his darling  comedies; and if Robles asked when \"Don Quixote\" would be ready, the  answer no doubt was: En breve-shortly, there was time enough for that. At  sixty-eight he was as full of life and hope and plans for the future as a  boy of eighteen.    Nemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which at  his leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October or  November 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave lately  printed at Tarragona, and calling itself \"Second Volume of the Ingenious  Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate Alonso Fernandez de  Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\" The last half of Chapter LIX and most of the  following chapters of the Second Part give us some idea of the effect  produced upon him, and his irritation was not likely to be lessened by  the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself. Had Avellaneda,  in fact, been content with merely bringing out a continuation to \"Don  Quixote,\" Cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance. His own  intentions were expressed in the very vaguest language at the end of the  book; nay, in his last words, \"forse altro cantera con miglior plettro,\"  he seems actually to invite some one else to continue the work, and he  made no sign until eight years and a half had gone by; by which time  Avellaneda's volume was no doubt written.    In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere  continuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to  it, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man  could pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his  hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless,  accuses him of envy of Lope's success, of petulance and querulousness,  and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda's reason for  this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is  clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope's school, for he has the  impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his  criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics  and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear  on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes  knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an  invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a  mosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language  pronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself,  supports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an  ecclesiastic, a Dominican probably.    Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull  to reflect much. \"Dull and dirty\" will always be, I imagine, the verdict  of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor  plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by  Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for  castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and  Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all  through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has  contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth  century novellieri and without their sprightliness.    But whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget the debt  we owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, \"Don Quixote\" would  have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even if  Cervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly he would  have left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the further  adventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. It is  plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral  romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and but for  Avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is more likely  that, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volume would  have remained unfinished till his death, and that we should have never  made the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone with Sancho to  Barataria.    From the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been  haunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field,  and putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off his task  and protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him. The  conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work  and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to Avellaneda  becomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate, a conclusion  and for that we must thank Avellaneda.    The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printed  till the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put together  the comedies and interludes he had written within the last few years,  and, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among the managers, and  published them with a preface, worth the book it introduces tenfold, in  which he gives an account of the early Spanish stage, and of his own  attempts as a dramatist. It is needless to say they were put forward by  Cervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits. The  reader, however, was not to suppose they were his last word or final  effort in the drama, for he had in hand a comedy called \"Engano a los  ojos,\" about which, if he mistook not, there would be no question.    Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; his  health had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently of dropsy,  on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost Shakespeare,  nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet been reformed.  He died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully.    Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell us  that it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life of  poverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment, but  Cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils. His was  not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue  of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he  was proof against it. It is impossible to conceive Cervantes giving way  to despondency or prostrated by dejection. As for poverty, it was with  him a thing to be laughed over, and the only sigh he ever allows to  escape him is when he says, \"Happy he to whom Heaven has given a piece of  bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but Heaven itself.\"  Add to all this his vital energy and mental activity, his restless  invention and his sanguine temperament, and there will be reason enough  to doubt whether his could have been a very unhappy life. He who could  take Cervantes' distresses together with his apparatus for enduring them  would not make so bad a bargain, perhaps, as far as happiness in life is  concerned.    Of his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, in  accordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitarian  nuns, of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was an  inmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another  convent, carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains of  Cervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and the clue  to their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishes  perhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglect  brought against his contemporaries. In some of the others there is a good  deal of exaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers one would  suppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man but against  his memory, or at least that it was insensible to his merits, and left  him to live in misery and die of want. To talk of his hard life and  unworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he done to  distinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning a  precarious livelihood? True, he was a gallant soldier, who had been  wounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his country's cause,  but there were hundreds of others in the same case. He had written a  mediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and some plays which  manifestly did not comply with the primary condition of pleasing: were  the playgoers to patronise plays that did not amuse them, because the  author was to produce \"Don Quixote\" twenty years afterwards?    The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately on  the appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility to  its merits.

AEneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as  Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes him.\"    \"That is true,\" said Samson; \"but it is one thing to write as a poet,  another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things,  not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has  to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were,  without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.\"    \"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"if this senor Moor goes in for telling the  truth, no doubt among my master's drubbings mine are to be found; for  they never took the measure of his worship's shoulders without doing the  same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for, as my  master himself says, the members must share the pain of the head.\"    \"You are a sly dog, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"i' faith, you have no  want of memory when you choose to remember.\"    \"If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,\" said Sancho, \"my  weals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs.\"    \"Hush, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and don't interrupt the bachelor, whom  I entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this history.\"    \"And about me,\" said Sancho, \"for they say, too, that I am one of the  principal presonages in it.\"    \"Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,\" said Samson.    \"What! Another word-catcher!\" said Sancho; \"if that's to be the way we  shall not make an end in a lifetime.\"    \"May God shorten mine, Sancho,\" returned the bachelor, \"if you are not  the second person in the history, and there are even some who would  rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there  are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing  there was any possibility in the government of that island offered you by  Senor Don Quixote.\"    \"There is still sunshine on the wall,\" said Don Quixote; \"and when Sancho  is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that years bring,  he will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he is at  present.\"    \"By God, master,\" said Sancho, \"the island that I cannot govern with the  years I have, I'll not be able to govern with the years of Methuselah;  the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance somewhere, I  know not where; and not that there is any want of head in me to govern  it.\"    \"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for all will be and perhaps  better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by God's will.\"    \"That is true,\" said Samson; \"and if it be God's will, there will not be  any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho to govern.\"    \"I have seen governors in these parts,\" said Sancho, \"that are not to be  compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called 'your  lordship' and served on silver.\"    \"Those are not governors of islands,\" observed Samson, \"but of other  governments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at least  know grammar.\"    \"I could manage the gram well enough,\" said Sancho; \"but for the mar I  have neither leaning nor liking, for I don't know what it is; but leaving  this matter of the government in God's hands, to send me wherever it may  be most to his service, I may tell you, senor bachelor Samson Carrasco,  it has pleased me beyond measure that the author of this history should  have spoken of me in such a way that what is said of me gives no offence;  for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had said anything about me that  was at all unbecoming an old Christian, such as I am, the deaf would have  heard of it.\"    \"That would be working miracles,\" said Samson.    \"Miracles or no miracles,\" said Sancho, \"let everyone mind how he speaks  or writes about people, and not set down at random the first thing that  comes into his head.\"    \"One of the faults they find with this history,\" said the bachelor, \"is  that its author inserted in it a novel called 'The Ill-advised  Curiosity;' not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place  and has nothing to do with the history of his worship Senor Don Quixote.\"    \"I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,\"  said Sancho.    \"Then, I say,\" said Don Quixote, \"the author of my history was no sage,  but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, set  about writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the  painter of Ubeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was  painting, answered, 'What it may turn out.' Sometimes he would paint a  cock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongside of  it in Gothic letters, 'This is a cock; and so it will be with my history,  which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.\"    \"No fear of that,\" returned Samson, \"for it is so plain that there is  nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young  people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in a  word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all  sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, 'There goes  Rocinante.' And those that are most given to reading it are the pages,  for there is not a lord's ante-chamber where there is not a 'Don Quixote'  to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one pounces  upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said history is the most  delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen,  for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an  immodest word, or a thought that is other than Catholic.\"    \"To write in any other way,\" said Don Quixote, \"would not be to write  truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood ought  to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not what could  have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories,  when he had so much to write about in mine; no doubt he must have gone by  the proverb 'with straw or with hay, etc,' for by merely setting forth my  thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he might  have made a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado  would make up. In fact, the conclusion I arrive at, senor bachelor, is,  that to write histories, or books of any kind, there is need of great  judgment and a ripe understanding. To give expression to humour, and  write in a strain of graceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses.  The cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make  people take him for a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a  sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God  is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books  broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.\"    \"There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,\" said the  bachelor.    \"No doubt of that,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but it often happens that those  who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by their  writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when they give  them to the press.\"    \"The reason of that,\" said Samson, \"is, that as printed works are  examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the  fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men famous for  their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or most  commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight and pleasure in  criticising the writings of others, without having produced any of their  own.\"    \"That is no wonder,\" said Don Quixote; \"for there are many divines who  are no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects or  excesses of those who preach.\"    \"All that is true, Senor Don Quixote,\" said Carrasco; \"but I wish such  fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so  much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble  at; for if aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus, they should remember how  long he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade  as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be  moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them;  and so I say very great is the risk to which he who prints a book exposes  himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that  will satisfy and please all readers.\"    \"That which treats of me must have pleased few,\" said Don Quixote.    \"Quite the contrary,\" said the bachelor; \"for, as stultorum infinitum est  numerus, innumerable are those who have relished the said history; but  some have brought a charge against the author's memory, inasmuch as he  forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho's Dapple; for it is not  stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that he was  stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the same ass,  without any reappearance of it.
