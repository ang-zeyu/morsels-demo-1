Beaupre,\" he said; and though he put  forward his own as being fuller in detail and more accurate, he was  careful to point out that he made no claim for superior workmanship, and  that, indeed, he would have been open to reproach if, after having  followed the coast with Beaupre's chart in hand, he had not effected  improvements where circumstances did not permit his predecessor to make  so close an examination. It is an attractive characteristic of Flinders,  that he never missed an opportunity of appreciating valuable service in  other navigators.    But from the time when the Investigator passed the head of the Bight, the  whole of the coast-line traversed was virginal to geographical science.  With a clean sheet of paper, Flinders began to chart a new stretch of the  earth's outline, and to link up the undiscovered with the known portions  of the great southern continent. Our interest in his work is intensified  by the reflection that of all the coasts of the habitable earth, this was  the last important portion still to be discovered. True it is that  research in the arctic and antarctic circles remained to be pursued, and  still remains. Man will not cease his efforts till he knows his planet in  its entirety, though the price of the knowledge may be high. But when he  has compassed the extreme ends of the globe, he will not have found a  rood of ground upon which any one will ever wish to live. The earth lust  of the nations is not provoked by thoughts of the two poles. Ruling out  the frozen regions, therefore, as places where discovery is pursued  without thought of future habitation, it is a striking fact that this  voyage of Flinders opened up the ultimate belt of the earth's contour  hitherto unknown. The continents were finally unveiled when he concluded  his labours. Europe, the centre of direction, had comprehended the form  of Asia, had encircled Africa, had brought America within ken and  control. It had gradually pieced together a knowledge of Australia, all  but the extensive area the greater part of which it was left for Flinders  to reveal. The era of important modern coastal discovery within habitable  regions, which commenced with the researches directed by Prince Henry the  Navigator from 1426 to 1460, and attained to brilliancy with Columbus in  1492 and Vasco da Gama in 1497, ended with Flinders in 1802 and 1803. He  ranges worthily with that illustrious company of \"men full of activity,  stirrers abroad, and searchers of the remote parts of the world,\" of whom  Richard Hakluyt speaks, and is outshone by none of them in the  faithfulness with which his work was done, and in all the qualities that  make up the man of high capacity and character entrusted with a great  enterprise.    When Flinders was appointed to the command of the Investigator, he was  only twenty-seven years of age. But he had already won distinction by his  demonstration that Bass Strait was a strait, and not a gulf, a fact not  proved by George Bass's famous voyage from Sydney to Westernport in a  whale-boat. His circumnavigation of Tasmania--then called Van Diemen's  Land--in the Norfolk; the discovery of the Tamar estuary and Port  Dalrymple; some excellent nautical surveying among the islands to the  north-west of Tasmania; and an expedition along the Queensland coast, had  also earned for him the confidence of his official superiors. His ardour  for discovery, and the exact, scientific character of his charts and  observations, won him a powerful and steadfast friend in Sir Joseph  Banks, who had been with Cook in the Endeavour in 1768 to 1771, and never  lost his interest in Australian exploration. At the beginning of his  naval career Flinders had tasted the \"delights of battle.\" As a  midshipman on the Bellerophon (Captain Pasley), he played his small part  on the \"glorious first of June\" (1794), when \"Black Dick,\" Lord Howe, won  his greatly vaunted victory over the French off Brest.    But before this event his tastes and aspirations had set in the direction  of another branch of the naval service. A voyage to the South Seas and  the West Indies under Bligh, in the Providence, in 1791, had revealed to  his imagination the glory of discovery and the vastness and beauty of the  world beyond European horizons. The fame and achievements of Cook were  still fresh and wonderful in the mouths of all who followed the sea.  Bligh, a superb sailor--not even the enemies whom he made by his rough  tongue and brusque manner denied that--taught him to be a scientific  navigator; and when he threaded the narrow, coral-walled waters of Torres  Strait, he knew that to the southward were coasts as yet unmarked on any  chart, seas as yet unploughed by any keel. For this work of exploration  Flinders nourished a passion as intense as that which inferior natures  have had for love, avarice, or honours. It absorbed all his life and  thought; and opportunity, becoming in his case the handmaid of capacity,  was abundantly justified by accomplishment.    There is one striking fact which serves to \"place\" Flinders among  navigators. As has just been observed, he learnt his practical navigation  under Bligh, on that historically unfortunate captain's second  bread-fruit expedition, when he was entrusted with the care of the  scientific instruments. Now, Bligh had perfected his navigation under  Cook, on the Resolution, and actually chose the landing-place in  Kealakeakua Bay, where the greatest English seaman who ever lived was  slain. Here is a school of great sailors: Cook the master of Bligh, Bligh  the master of Flinders; and Flinders in turn had on board the  Investigator as a midshipman, his cousin, John Franklin, to whom he  taught navigation, and who acquired from him that \"ardent love of  geographical research\" which brought him immortal fame, and a grave  amongst the ice-packs and the snows of the North-West Passage.* (* See  Markham, Life of Sir John Franklin page 43 and Traill, Life of Franklin  page 16. Traill's graceful sentences are worth transcribing: \"The example  of the fine seaman and enthusiastic explorer under whom he served must  indeed, for a lad of Franklin's ardent temperament, have been an  education in itself. Throughout his whole life he cherished the warmest  admiration for the character of Matthew Flinders, and in later years he  welcomed the opportunity of paying an enduring tribute to his old  commander's memory in the very region of the world which his discoveries  had done so much to gain for civilisation.\" It is pleasant to find  Flinders speaking cordially of his young pupil in a letter written during  the voyage. \"He is a very fine youth, and there is every probability of  his doing credit to the Investigator and himself.\") There is nothing  comparable with this direct succession of illustrious masters and pupils  in the history of navigation. The names of all four are indelibly written  on the map of the world. Three of them--Cook, Flinders, and Franklin--are  among our very foremost navigators and discoverers, men whom a race proud  of the heritage of the sea will for ever hold in honour and affection;  whilst the fourth, Bligh, though his reputation is wounded by association  with two mutinies, was in truth a daring and a brilliant seaman, and a  brave man in a fight. Nelson especially thanked him for noble service at  Copenhagen, and his achievement in working a small, open boat from the  mid-Pacific, where the mutinous crew of the Bounty dropped him, through  Torres Strait to Timor, a distance of 3620 miles, stands memorably on the  credit side of his account.    See what it meant to have been trained in a school that observed the  rules and respected the traditions of James Cook. When at the end of his  long voyage of nine months and nine days, Flinders took the Investigator  through Port Jackson heads into harbour (Sunday, May 9, 1802), he had not  a sick man on board.* (* Voyage 1 226.) His crew finished hearty,  browned, and vigorous. He was able to write from the Cape of Good Hope  that \"officers and crew were, generally speaking, in better health than  on the day we sailed from Spithead, and not in less good spirits.\"  Scrupulous attention to cleanliness and hygiene produced this result in  an age when scurvy was more to be feared than shipwreck. On every fine  day the decks below and the cockpit were washed, dried with stoves, and  sprinkled with vinegar. Care was taken to prevent the crew from sleeping  in wet clothes. At frequent intervals beds, chests, and bags were opened  out and exposed to the sweetening influences of fresh air and sunshine.  Personal cleanliness was enforced. Lime-juice and other anti-scorbutics  were frequently served out: a precautionary measure which originated in  Cook's day, and which down to our own times has caused all British  sailors to be popularly known as \"lime-juicers\" in the American Navy. The  dietary scale and the cooking were subjects of careful thought. This keen  young officer of twenty-seven looked after his company of eighty-seven  people with as grave and kindly a concern as if he were a grey-bearded  father to them all; and was liberally rewarded by their affection. During  his imprisonment in Mauritius, one of his men stayed with him voluntarily  for several years, enduring the unpleasantness of life in confinement far  away from home, out of sheer devotion to his commander; and did not leave  until Flinders, becoming hopeless of liberation, insisted on his taking  advantage of an opportunity of going to England.    There is a touching proof of Flinders' tender regard for his men in the  naming of a small group of islands to the west of the bell-mouth of  Spencer's Gulf. A boat's crew commanded by the mate, John Thistle, was  drowned there, through the boat capsizing. Thistle was an excellent  seaman, who had been one of Bass's whale-boat crew in 1798, and had  volunteered for service with the Investigator.

On the way to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh,  whom I called Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing for a guru  in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness.  Well-camouflaged, we hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts.    \"All we need now are canvas shoes.\" I led my companions to a shop  displaying rubber-soled footwear. \"Articles of leather, gotten  only through the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this holy  trip.\" I halted on the street to remove the leather cover from my  BHAGAVAD GITA, and the leather straps from my English-made SOLA  TOPEE (helmet).    At the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to  transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the  train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of  my glorious anticipations.    \"Just imagine!\" I ejaculated. \"We shall be initiated by the masters  and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will  be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas  will come tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek house  cats awaiting our caresses!\"    This remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both  metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from  Amar.  But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window  at the scampering landscape.    \"Let the money be divided in three portions.\" Jatinda broke a long  silence with this suggestion. \"Each of us should buy his own ticket  at Burdwan. Thus no one at the station will surmise that we are  running away together.\"    I unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan.  Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the platform.  We waited fifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching  in all directions, we shouted Jatinda's name with the urgency  of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the  little station.    I was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That God  would countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion  of my first carefully-planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.    \"Amar, we must return home.\" I was weeping like a child. \"Jatinda's  callous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure.\"    \"Is this your love for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test  of a treacherous companion?\"    Through Amar's suggestion of a divine test, my heart steadied  itself.  We refreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats,  SITABHOG (food for the goddess) and MOTICHUR (nuggets of sweet  pearl). In a few hours, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly.  Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we discussed a vital matter as we  waited on the platform.    \"Amar, we may soon be closely questioned by railroad officials.  I am not underrating my brother's ingenuity! No matter what the  outcome, I will not speak untruth.\"    \"All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still. Don't laugh or grin  while I am talking.\"    At this moment, a European station agent accosted me. He waved a  telegram whose import I immediately grasped.    \"Are you running away from home in anger?\"    \"No!\" I was glad his choice of words permitted me to make emphatic  reply. Not anger but \"divinest melancholy\" was responsible, I knew,  for my unconventional behavior.    The official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed  hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity.    \"Where is the third boy?\" The man injected a full ring of authority  into his voice. \"Come on; speak the truth!\"    \"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you see that  we are only two?\" Amar smiled impudently. \"I am not a magician; I  can't conjure up a third companion.\"    The official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought  a new field of attack.    \"What is your name?\"    \"I am called Thomas. I am the son of an English mother and a  converted Christian Indian father.\"    \"What is your friend's name?\"    \"I call him Thompson.\"    By this time my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously  made for the train, whistling for departure. Amar followed with  the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into  a European compartment. It evidently pained him to think of two  half-English boys traveling in the section allotted to natives. After  his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably.  My friend wore an expression of blithe satisfaction at having  outwitted a veteran European official.    On the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother,  it went thus: \"Three Bengali boys in English clothes running away  from home toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until  my arrival. Ample reward for your services.\"    \"Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home.\" My  glance was reproachful. \"Brother must have found one there.\"    My friend sheepishly acknowledged the thrust. We halted briefly  in Bareilly, where Dwarka Prasad awaited us with a telegram from  Ananta.  My old friend tried valiantly to detain us; I convinced him  that our flight had not been undertaken lightly. As on a previous  occasion, Dwarka refused my invitation to set forth to the Himalayas.    While our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep,  Amar was awakened by another questioning official. He, too, fell a  victim to the hybrid charms of \"Thomas\" and \"Thompson.\" The train  bore us triumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic  mountains loomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the  station and entered the freedom of city crowds. Our first act was  to change into native costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated  our European disguise. A premonition of capture weighed on my mind.    Deeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to  proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil long hallowed by feet of many  masters. I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on  the platform. He was brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a  policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow  and took charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was  his duty to hold us until my elder brother arrived.    Learning that the truants' destination had been the Himalayas, the  officer related a strange story.    \"I see you are crazy about saints! You will never meet a greater  man of God than the one I saw only yesterday. My brother officer  and I first encountered him five days ago. We were patrolling by the  Ganges, on a sharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions  were to capture him, alive or dead. He was known to be masquerading  as a SADHU in order to rob pilgrims. A short way before us, we  spied a figure which resembled the description of the criminal. He  ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower him. Approaching  his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the man's right  arm was severed almost completely from his body.    \"Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger  astonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of  him, he spoke quietly.    \"'I am not the murderer you are seeking.'    \"I was deeply mortified to see I had injured the person of a  divine--looking sage. Prostrating myself at his feet, I implored  his pardon, and offered my turban-cloth to staunch the heavy spurts  of blood.    \"'Son, that was just an understandable mistake on your part.' The  saint regarded me kindly. 'Run along, and don't reproach yourself.  The Beloved Mother is taking care of me.' He pushed his dangling  arm into its stump and lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased  to flow.    \"'Come to me under yonder tree in three days and you will find me  fully healed. Thus you will feel no remorse.'    \"Yesterday my brother officer and I went eagerly to the designated  spot. The SADHU was there and allowed us to examine his arm. It  bore no scar or trace of hurt!    \"'I am going via Rishikesh to the Himalayan solitudes.' He blessed  us as he departed quickly. I feel that my life has been uplifted  through his sanctity.\"    The officer concluded with a pious ejaculation; his experience had  obviously moved him beyond his usual depths. With an impressive  gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In  the usual garbled manner of the sensational type of newspaper (not  missing, alas! even in India), the reporter's version was slightly  exaggerated: it indicated that the SADHU had been almost decapitated!    Amar and I lamented that we had missed the great yogi who could  forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike way. India, materially  poor for the last two centuries, yet has an inexhaustible fund of  divine wealth; spiritual \"skyscrapers\" may occasionally be encountered  by the wayside, even by worldly men like this policeman.    We thanked the officer for relieving our tedium with his marvelous  story. He was probably intimating that he was more fortunate than  we: he had met an illumined saint without effort; our earnest search  had ended, not at the feet of a master, but in a coarse police  station!    So near the Himalayas and yet, in our captivity, so far, I told  Amar I felt doubly impelled to seek freedom.    \"Let us slip away when opportunity offers. We can go on foot to  holy Rishikesh.\" I smiled encouragingly.    But my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop  of our money had been taken from us.    \"If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should  finish, not in the city of saints, but in the stomachs of tigers!\"    Ananta and Amar's brother arrived after three days. Amar greeted  his relative with affectionate relief. I was unreconciled; Ananta  got no more from me than a severe upbraiding.    \"I understand how you feel.\" My brother spoke soothingly. \"All I  ask of you is to accompany me to Benares to meet a certain"]]]
