[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#7)"],[1,"now over twenty nationalities who are  joined to the Lord.    Zechariah in the same chapter says:     \"And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the Holy Land and   shall choose Jerusalem again. Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord;   for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.\"    These things are soon to take place, when the Jews will be gathered.     \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion: shout, O daughter of Jerusalem;   behold thy king cometh unto thee.\"_--Zec. 9, 9._    He will come this second time, when:     \"They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.\"_--Zec. 12,10._    Again, this prophet says in chapter 15, 6:     \"And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?   Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of   my friends.\"     \"In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David   and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\"_--Zec. 12, 1._    The same book, 14th chapter, says:     \"His feet shall stand in that day upon the _Mount of Olives_.\"    It appears sufficiently plain that God has set his hand again the  second time to gather not only the _Jews,_ but the _House_ of Israel.    In Isaiah, 11th chapter, it is clearly stated that there is to be an  ensign to the _people_; to it shall the _gentiles_ seek. And the next  verse says that in that day the Lord will set his hand _again_ the  _second_ time to gather his people.     \"And he shall set up an ensign for the _nations,_ and shall assemble   the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the   four corners of the earth.\"_--Isaiah, 11,12._    We learn more perfectly in the tenth verse that the Gentiles as well as  the Jews are remembered.    Isaiah, 2nd chapter, says:     \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the   Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains.\"    Following on we find that two places are distinctly spoken of: _Zion,_  from whence the law of God is to go forth; and the word of the Lord  from JERUSALEM. And as Jesus came to his own (the Jews) first, and to  the Gentiles last, so now the first shall be last and the last shall  be first. And in our day Joseph Smith has been directed by the Lord to  gather the people to Zion, as so vividly portrayed by the prophet who  saw the angel who should run and speak to the young man.    Having introduced these Bible evidences, we shall repeat the testimony  of three witnesses whom God raised up, and who, until their death, were  always true and faithful to their testimony:     \"Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto   whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the   Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain   this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of   the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who   came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we also know that   they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice   hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work   is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which   are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of   God, and not of man. And we declare with words of solemness, that an   angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our   eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon;   and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord   Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are   true: and it is marvelous in our eyes; nevertheless, the voice of the   Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be   obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these   things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid   our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the   judgment seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the   heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the   Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.     OLIVER COWDERY, DAVID WHITMER, MARTIN HARRIS.    Notwithstanding every one of these three witnesses withdrew from the  Church in 1838, yet they remained firm in their declarations to the  truth of their testimony. Nine years afterwards Oliver Cowdery returned  to the church and was rebaptized. In 1871 Martin Harris came to Utah,  and he also was rebaptized. David Whitmer, who died at Richmond, Ray  Co., Mo., was the only one of the three who died without rebaptism. He  had resided in that place nearly fifty years, and many leading citizens  of Richmond signed their names, which were published, testifying that  David Whitmer was an honorable citizen whose veracity was unquestioned.    I can testify to the truth of these statements, for I visited him in  1870, also in 1879, and again in 1886. I was acquainted with him in  1833 and also in 1838 when he was disfellowshipped by the Church at  Far West, Mo. It was no secret among those who knew him at his home in  Richmond that he always stood firm to his testimony, as above stated.  The other two witnesses were equally valiant, both while in full  fellowship and after withdrawing from the Church, and I defy the world  to impeach either of those three witnesses.    Joseph Smith could not have accomplished the work entrusted to him  without the aid of the Urim and Thummim. It was therefore provided for  him. Anciently it was used by God's servants--His prophets, seers and  revelators. The language engraven upon the gold plates is Reformed  Egyptian and is spoken of in the Book of Mormon, which says:     \"And now behold, we have written this according to our knowledge   in the characters which are called among us the Reformed Egyptian,   being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of   speech.\"_--Book of Mormon, p.570, N. E._    And the thirty-fourth verse says:     \"But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and that none   other people knoweth our language; therefore hath he prepared means   for the interpretation thereof.\"    There is still another instance worth mentioning. King Limhi was  in possession of twenty-four gold plates, and desired to have them  translated. Ammon told the king:     \"I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man who can translate the   records; for he has wherewith that he can look and translate all   records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God, and the   things are called interpreters.\"_--Book of Mormon, p. 30, N. E._     \"And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which   were fastened into the two rims of a bow. Now these things were   prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation   to generation, for the purpose of interpreting language.\"_--Book of   Mormon, p. 228, 13-14 v._     \"And whosoever has these things is called Seer, after the manner of   old times.\"_--Book of Mormon, p. 228, 16 v._    By the above we learn that the Urim and Thummim or interpreters was  anciently used, and answered the description of those that Joseph is  represented as receiving.    The Prophet's mother was permitted to see and handle them and describes  them thus:     \"I found that they consisted of two smooth, three-cornered diamonds,   set in glass, and the glasses were set in silver bows which were   connected with each other in much the same way as old-fashioned   spectacles.\"    Martin Harris described them just the same, only he said they were  larger than the ordinary spectacles.    Some have marveled at the Lord's choice in selecting one so young and  unlearned as Joseph Smith to perform so great a work. However, the  Lord's ways are not man's ways. For,     \"As the Heavens are higher than the earth, so are the Lord's ways   higher than man's ways.\"    As an instance we read how the Lord sent the prophet Samuel unto Jesse,  saying he had provided a king among his sons. And how, when Samuel  looked on Eliab, he thought surely the Lord's anointed was before him.  But the Lord said unto Samuel:     \"Look not at his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because   I have refused him; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man   looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\"    After seven sons of Jesse had been presented, Samuel asked, \"Are here  all thy children?\" to which Jesse replied, \"There remaineth yet the  youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep.\" And he it was whom the Lord  had chosen should be anointed king. Samuel did the bidding of the Lord,  and we learn that the spirit of God rested upon David, and he became a  man after God's own heart.    In this connection we will not pass by unnoticed God's mighty power in  raising up the great prophet Moses, as a deliverer of His chosen people  from under the hand of Pharoah, the oppressor and king of Egypt. In  this case, His power was manifested in overruling Pharoah's midwives  even unto disobedience of their wicked king in preserving the male  children of the promised seed of Abraham, as found in the 1st chapter  of Exodus:     \"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt   commanded them, but saved the men children alive.\" [That is, the   Hebrew children, for they were the ones the king sought to destroy.]     \"Therefore, God dealt well with the midwives; and the people   multiplied, and waxed very mighty.     \"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made   them houses.     \"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, every son that is born   ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.\"    Where is the mother that will not join in saying that King Pharoah was  an oppressor, a tyrant and a murderer? Yet God's ways are so kind, good  merciful and wise that we are led to praise His holy name forever. God  raised up a Moses, whose mother"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#7)"],[1," connected with this house?\"  asked Gilbert.  \"Somebody told me you could tell it, Captain Jim.\"    \"Well, yes, I know it.  I reckon I'm the only person living in Four  Winds now that can remember the schoolmaster's bride as she was when  she come to the Island.  She's been dead this thirty year, but she was  one of them women you never forget.\"    \"Tell us the story,\" pleaded Anne.  \"I want to find out all about the  women who have lived in this house before me.\"    \"Well, there's jest been three--Elizabeth Russell, and Mrs. Ned  Russell, and the schoolmaster's bride.  Elizabeth Russell was a nice,  clever little critter, and Mrs. Ned was a nice woman, too.  But they  weren't ever like the schoolmaster's bride.    \"The schoolmaster's name was John Selwyn.  He came out from the Old  Country to teach school at the Glen when I was a boy of sixteen.  He  wasn't much like the usual run of derelicts who used to come out to  P.E.I. to teach school in them days.  Most of them were clever, drunken  critters who taught the children the three R's when they were sober,  and lambasted them when they wasn't.  But John Selwyn was a fine,  handsome young fellow.  He boarded at my father's, and he and me were  cronies, though he was ten years older'n me.  We read and walked and  talked a heap together.  He knew about all the poetry that was ever  written, I reckon, and he used to quote it to me along shore in the  evenings.  Dad thought it an awful waste of time, but he sorter endured  it, hoping it'd put me off the notion of going to sea.  Well, nothing  could do THAT--mother come of a race of sea-going folk and it was born  in me.  But I loved to hear John read and recite.  It's almost sixty  years ago, but I could repeat yards of poetry I learned from him.  Nearly sixty years!\"    Captain Jim was silent for a space, gazing into the glowing fire in a  quest of the bygones.  Then, with a sigh, he resumed his story.    \"I remember one spring evening I met him on the sand-hills.  He looked  sorter uplifted--jest like you did, Dr. Blythe, when you brought  Mistress Blythe in tonight.  I thought of him the minute I seen you.  And he told me that he had a sweetheart back home and that she was  coming out to him.  I wasn't more'n half pleased, ornery young lump of  selfishness that I was; I thought he wouldn't be as much my friend  after she came.  But I'd enough decency not to let him see it.  He told  me all about her.  Her name was Persis Leigh, and she would have come  out with him if it hadn't been for her old uncle.  He was sick, and  he'd looked after her when her parents died and she wouldn't leave him.  And now he was dead and she was coming out to marry John Selwyn.  'Twasn't no easy journey for a woman in them days.  There weren't no  steamers, you must ricollect.    \"'When do you expect her?' says I.    \"'She sails on the Royal William, the 20th of June,' says he, 'and so  she should be here by mid-July.  I must set Carpenter Johnson to  building me a home for her.  Her letter come today.  I know before I  opened it that it had good news for me.  I saw her a few nights ago.'    \"I didn't understand him, and then he explained--though I didn't  understand THAT much better.  He said he had a gift--or a curse.  Them  was his words, Mistress Blythe--a gift or a curse.  He didn't know  which it was.  He said a great-great-grandmother of his had had it, and  they burned her for a witch on account of it.  He said queer  spells--trances, I think was the name he give 'em--come over him now  and again.  Are there such things, Doctor?\"    \"There are people who are certainly subject to trances,\" answered  Gilbert.  \"The matter is more in the line of psychical research than  medical.  What were the trances of this John Selwyn like?\"    \"Like dreams,\" said the old Doctor skeptically.    \"He said he could see things in them,\" said Captain Jim slowly.    \"Mind you, I'm telling you jest what HE said--things that were  happening--things that were GOING to happen.  He said they were  sometimes a comfort to him and sometimes a horror.  Four nights before  this he'd been in one--went into it while he was sitting looking at the  fire.  And he saw an old room he knew well in England, and Persis Leigh  in it, holding out her hands to him and looking glad and happy.  So he  knew he was going to hear good news of her.\"    \"A dream--a dream,\" scoffed the old Doctor.    \"Likely--likely,\" conceded Captain Jim.  \"That's what _I_ said to him  at the time.  It was a vast more comfortable to think so.  I didn't  like the idea of him seeing things like that--it was real uncanny.    \"'No,' says he, 'I didn't dream it.  But we won't talk of this again.  You won't be so much my friend if you think much about it.'    \"I told him nothing could make me any less his friend.  But he jest  shook his head and says, says he:    \"'Lad, I know.  I've lost friends before because of this.  I don't  blame them.  There are times when I feel hardly friendly to myself  because of it.  Such a power has a bit of divinity in it--whether of a  good or an evil divinity who shall say?  And we mortals all shrink from  too close contact with God or devil.'    \"Them was his words.  I remember them as if 'twas yesterday, though I  didn't know jest what he meant.  What do you s'pose he DID mean,  doctor?\"    \"I doubt if he knew what he meant himself,\" said Doctor Dave testily.    \"I think I understand,\" whispered Anne.  She was listening in her old  attitude of clasped lips and shining eyes.  Captain Jim treated himself  to an admiring smile before he went on with his story.    \"Well, purty soon all the Glen and Four Winds people knew the  schoolmaster's bride was coming, and they were all glad because they  thought so much of him.  And everybody took an interest in his new  house--THIS house.  He picked this site for it, because you could see  the harbor and hear the sea from it.  He made the garden out there for  his bride, but he didn't plant the Lombardies.  Mrs. Ned Russell  planted THEM.  But there's a double row of rose-bushes in the garden  that the little girls who went to the Glen school set out there for the  schoolmaster's bride.  He said they were pink for her cheeks and white  for her brow and red for her lips.  He'd quoted poetry so much that he  sorter got into the habit of talking it, too, I reckon.    \"Almost everybody sent him some little present to help out the  furnishing of the house.  When the Russells came into it they were  well-to-do and furnished it real handsome, as you can see; but the  first furniture that went into it was plain enough.  This little house  was rich in love, though.  The women sent in quilts and tablecloths and  towels, and one man made a chest for her, and another a table and so  on.  Even blind old Aunt Margaret Boyd wove a little basket for her out  of the sweet-scented sand-hill grass.  The schoolmaster's wife used it  for years to keep her handkerchiefs in.    \"Well, at last everything was ready--even to the logs in the big  fireplace ready for lighting.  'Twasn't exactly THIS fireplace, though  'twas in the same place.  Miss Elizabeth had this put in when she made  the house over fifteen years ago.  It was a big, old-fashioned  fireplace where you could have roasted an ox.  Many's the time I've sat  here and spun yarns, same's I'm doing tonight.\"    Again there was a silence, while Captain Jim kept a passing tryst with  visitants Anne and Gilbert could not see--the folks who had sat with  him around that fireplace in the vanished years, with mirth and bridal  joy shining in eyes long since closed forever under churchyard sod or  heaving leagues of sea.  Here on olden nights children had tossed  laughter lightly to and fro.  Here on winter evenings friends had  gathered.  Dance and music and jest had been here.  Here youths and  maidens had dreamed.  For Captain Jim the little house was tenanted  with shapes entreating remembrance.    \"It was the first of July when the house was finished.  The  schoolmaster began to count the days then.  We used to see him walking  along the shore, and we'd say to each other, 'She'll soon be with him  now.'    \"She was expected the middle of July, but she didn't come then.  Nobody  felt anxious.  Vessels were often delayed for days and mebbe weeks.  The Royal William was a week overdue--and then two--and then three.  And at last we began to be frightened, and it got worse and worse.  Fin'lly I couldn't bear to look into John Selwyn's eyes.  D'ye know,  Mistress Blythe\"--Captain Jim lowered his voice--\"I used to think that  they looked just like what his old great-great-grandmother's must have  been when they were burning her to death.  He never said much but he  taught school like a man in a dream and then hurried to the shore.  Many a night he walked there from dark to dawn.  People said he was  losing his mind.  Everybody had given up hope--the Royal William was  eight weeks overdue.  It was the middle of September and the  schoolmaster's bride hadn't come--never would come, we thought.    \"There was a big storm then that lasted three days, and on the evening  after it died away I went to the shore.  I found the schoolmaster  there, leaning with his arms folded against a big rock, gazing out to  sea.    \"I spoke to him but he didn't answer.  His eyes seemed to be looking at  something I couldn't see.  His face was set, like a dead man's.    \"'John--John,' I called out--jest like that--jest like a frightened  child, 'wake up--wake up.'    \"That strange, awful look seemed to sorter fade out of his eyes.    \"He turned his head and looked at me.  I've never forgot his  face--never will forget it till I ships for my last voyage.    \"'All is well, lad,' he says.  'I've seen the Royal William coming  around East Point.  She will be here by dawn.  Tomorrow night I shall  sit with my bride by my own hearth-fire.'    \"Do you think he did see it?\" demanded Captain Jim abruptly.    \"God knows,\" said Gilbert "]]]
