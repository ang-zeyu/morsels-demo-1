He has  mentioned without flattery, extenuation, or malice, such private  virtues and vices of the various pontiffs as fell within the scope of  his inquiry, leaving it to others to fix the delicate line which is  supposed to divide personal errors from papal infallibility.           *       *       *       *       *    A considerable portion of these volumes was written in Italy, before  the close of Pope Gregory's reign, and under impressions formed upon  the existing state of the country. It has been their author's good  fortune to know much of that attractive land during the last twenty  years of the long peace, and to admire her substantial prosperity and  steady progress. Between 1825 and 1846 he has seen in her cities new  streets and squares rising, thoroughfares opened, gas-lights generally  introduced, ruinous houses substantially rebuilt, crumbling churches  and palaces renovated, shops enlarged and beautified, cafes, hotels,  and baths multiplied and decorated, public drives and gardens created,  equipages rivalling those of northern capitals, museums formed,  galleries enriched, the dress and comforts of the population greatly  improved, the street nuisances of Rome removed, the lazzaroni of  Naples clothed.    In the rural districts he has observed cultivation spreading, waste  lands reclaimed, irrigation and drainage carried on, the great  highways rendered excellent, whole provinces opened up by new roads,  railways rapidly extending, rivers and torrents bridged, palatial  villas springing up round the towns and watering-places, banditti  suppressed, the peasantry ameliorated in aspect. He has learnt, from  crowded ports and spreading factories, that capital was increasing and  industry being developed.    He has also noticed that, without organic changes, the political  condition of the people was being modified; that Tuscany enjoyed the  mildest of paternal governments; that in Lombardy, Piedmont, and  Naples, many repressive statutes were in abeyance; that in Turin and  Florence restraints upon the press were tacitly being relaxed; that  scientific congresses were generally permitted, and political economy  freely discussed; whilst, in regard to Rome, he ascertained the  practical truth of a popular sarcasm, that prohibitory laws were  usually binding but for three days.    While conscious of all this progress, the author felt that much  remained to be done. He knew that the advance of the country was only  comparative, and rendered more apparent by her long previous  stagnation. He daily had before him solecisms in policy, errors of  administration, official indolence or corruption; above all, ample  proofs that priests were no longer adapted for ministers of state. He  believed that intellect was needlessly or unwisely shackled, and that,  to ardent or speculative minds, the full blaze of knowledge might be  less deceptive than a compulsory twilight.    But, on the other hand, he was deeply convinced that, in material  welfare, the Italian people were already far above the average; that  any sudden change was more likely to endanger than to augment it;  that, to a nation so listless yet so impressionable, so credulous but  so suspicious, self-government was a questionable boon; at all events,  that the mass of its present generation was infinitely too ignorant  and unpractised, possibly too conceited and self-seeking, to  comprehend the theory of a constitution, or to perform the duties it  would necessarily impose. He knew further, that those who vaguely  longed for change were usually blind to the benefits which their  country already enjoyed, and had no definite or plausible plan for the  removal of its grievances without perilling its advantages. He felt  satisfied that, should an occasion ever present itself for testing  their Utopian theories, native leaders, united in aims and worthy of  their reliance, would be wanting. The movement party in Italy then  scarcely numbered a man who had a considerable property to stake, a  social position to lend him influence, or tried business habits to  gain the confidence of his fellow-citizens. Those who stood prepared  to pilot the vessel through revolutionary storms were, for the most  part, persons whose detected intrigues, or rash outbreaks, had already  driven them, with little credit, into exile, where, cut off from  intercourse with home, and associating chiefly with kindred spirits  expelled from other lands, they forgot much which it was important to  keep in view, and learned little of that candour and moderation which  are the true leaven of politics. Neglecting there those practical  reforms of which Italy stood really in need, they devoted themselves  to one idea. They set up the phantom of political unity as a new  faith; they decreed that its worship should be the condition of their  country's resurrection, and that all who demurred to it should be  hunted down. Had they read Dante, or remembered what they hourly had  seen, heard, and said in their native land, they would have known that  their idol, like the image in Nebuchadnezzar's dream,[5] was of  incongruous and incompatible materials; that their unitarian scheme  was antipathic to every passion and prejudice of those upon whom they  would thrust it.    [Footnote 5: Daniel ii. 32.]           *       *       *       *       *    Under such impressions were written the very few allusions to the  actual state of Italy which this work contains. The aspirations of her  regenerators after nationality and constitutional freedom have since  been fostered by her spiritual ruler, and prematurely fired by an  explosion of French democracy. Subsequent events, under altered  circumstances, may accordingly seem to have invalidated opinions  therein expressed; but the end is not yet. The present continues  overshadowed by gloom, and the torch of hope glimmers but dimly in the  distance. A sincere interest in the country and its people dictates  our prayer that the God of nations may grant an issue realising the  fondest anticipations of genuine patriotism, and eventually crown  these struggles with results compensating their recent evils.    Yet when we recollect the condition of Italy as we left her shores  four short years ago,--when we contrast the calm then around her  institutions, the stillness of her every-day life, the careless ease  of her nobles, the physical enjoyment of her middle classes, the  simple well-being of the peasantry under their own vines and  fig-trees,--we must sigh to see so much positive happiness perilled  for contingent ameliorations which, if ever attained, may, like most  political experiments, fail to realise the promised benefits.         \"Let him who sees mad war like deluge sweep         Surrounding regions, learn his peace to prize;         Let the poor bark with sides unripped, which tries         In vain by helm and sail its course to keep,       Make for the port. He lives perchance to weep,         Who quits the genial air and smiling skies         For depths unknown. O blind desire unwise         Of mortals, spurning thus on earth to creep!       O when, in this his mouldering garment frail,         Did man, whose thread soon breaks and joins no more,         Clear his own path, or by his power prevail?\"[6]    [Footnote 6: _Giovanni della Casa_, translated by JAMES GLASSFORD.]    In a work of history, party politics ought to have no place; and when  the nations are moved there is little inducement to assume a prophet's  mantle. We, therefore, gladly leave a topic on which perhaps too much  has been said. Possibly some Italians, to whom we have formerly  represented that it were         \"Better to bear the ills we know,       Than rush on others that we wot not of,\"    may yet admit the truth of this suggestion. May they never personally  realise the adage, that those who originate revolutions reap all their  evils, without living to share their fruits!           *       *       *       *       *    A few words regarding the method adopted in these volumes. Of the  names most conspicuous in Italian literature and art, a considerable  proportion will there find a place; but readers who expect to see  their productions enumerated, and their merits submitted to exhaustive  criticism, will be disappointed. All that our limits permit, after  rapidly sketching the revival of knowledge and the progress of that  sacred painting which emanated from Umbria, is to mention those who  have contributed to shed lustre over the duchy of Urbino, or who  shared the patronage of its princes. The amount of notice allotted to  each is therefore proportioned rather to its local importance than its  absolute excellence; but, satisfied from experience how seldom a  wide-spread interest attaches to individual details, our aim has ever  been to generalise even those points demanding a more specific notice  in connection with our immediate subject.    As the recurrence of foot-notes in a popular narrative unpleasantly  distracts the reader from its continuous course, these have been  avoided, unless when especially called for; and the necessity for them  in citing references has been in a great degree anticipated, by  prefixing a list of the leading authorities consulted, which it is  hoped will generally bear out views that have been honestly formed,  after examining what seemed the best sources of information. Extracts  have been introduced, where it appeared desirable to preserve the  style or words of an author; but they are in most cases rendered  (literally rather than with elegance) into English, except such  specimens of poetry as could not be fairly estimated from a  translation.

We could by  no means feel sure that the intrusion, in our own times, of a similar  test into a similar scene might not spoil the revels.    [Illustration: ENJOYING CHRISTMAS.--_Page 46._]    But to return. The old ballads which relate to this period of the year  are redolent of good things, and not to be read by a hungry man with any  degree of equanimity. Of course they are _ex post facto_ ballads, and  could only have been written under the inspiration of memory, at a time  when men were at leisure to devote their hands to some other occupation  than that of cooking or carving. But it is very difficult to understand  how they ever found--as it appears they did--their mouths in a condition  to sing them at the season itself. There is one amongst those ballads,  of a comparatively modern date, printed in Evans's collection, which we  advise no man to read fasting. It is directed to be sung to the tune of  \"The Delights of the Bottle,\" and contains in every verse a vision of  good things, summed up by the perpetually recurring burthen of        \"Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc'd-pies, and roast beef.\"    Our readers had better take a biscuit and a glass of sherry before they  venture upon the glimpses into those regions of banqueting which we are  tempted to lay before them. The ballad opens like the ringing of a  dinner-bell, and, we conceive, should be sung to some such  accompaniment:--        \"All you that to feasting and mirth are inclin'd,       Come here is good news for to pleasure your mind,--       Old Christmas is come for to keep open house,       _He scorns to be guilty of starving a mouse_:       Then come, boys, and welcome for diet the chief,       Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc'd-pies, and roast beef.\"    \"Diet _the chief_!\"--by which we are to understand that this promising  muster-roll merely includes the names of some of the principal  viands,--the high-commissioned dishes of the feast,--leaving the  subalterns, and the entire rank and file which complete the goodly  array, unmentioned. It must have been a very ingenious or a very  strong-minded mouse which could contrive to be starved under such  circumstances. The ballad is long, and we can only afford to give our  readers \"tastings\" of its good things. It is everywhere full of most  gracious promise:--        \"The cooks shall be busied, by day and by night,       In roasting and boiling, for taste and delight,       Their senses in liquor that's nappy they'll steep,       Though they be afforded to have little sleep;       They still are employed for to dress us, in brief,       Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc'd-pies, and roast beef.        \"Although the cold weather doth hunger provoke,       'T is a comfort to see how the chimneys do smoke;       Provision is making for beer, ale, and wine,       For _all that are willing or ready to dine_:       Then haste to the kitchen for diet the chief,       Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc'd-pies, and roast beef.        \"All travellers, as they do pass on their way,       At gentlemen's halls are invited to stay,       Themselves to refresh and their horses to rest,       Since that he must be old Christmas's guest;       Nay, the poor shall not want, but have for relief       Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc'd-pies, and roast beef.\"    And so on, through a variety of joyous and substantial anticipations,  from which the writer draws an inference, which we think is most  satisfactorily made out:--        \"Then _well may we welcome_ old Christmas to town,       Who brings us good cheer, and good liquor so brown;       To pass the cold winter away with delight,       We feast it all day, and we frolick all night.\"    In Ellis's edition of Brand's \"Popular Antiquities\" an old Christmas  song is quoted from \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" for 1695, which gives a  similar enumeration of Christmas dainties, but throws them into a form  calculated for more rapid enunciation, as if with a due regard to the  value of those moments at which it was probably usual to sing it. The  measure is not such a mouthful as that of the former one which we have  quoted. It comes trippingly off the tongue; and it is not impossible  that, in those days of skilful gastronomy, it might have been sung  eating. We will quote a couple of the verses, though they include the  same commissariat truths as that from which we have already extracted;  and our readers will observe, from the ill-omened wish which concludes  the second of these stanzas, in what horror the mere idea of _fasting_  had come to be held, since it is the heaviest curse which suggested  itself to be launched against those who refused to do homage to the  spirit of the times:--        \"Now thrice welcome Christmas,         Which brings us good cheer,       Minc'd pies and plumb-porridge,         Good ale and strong beer;       With pig, goose, and capon,         The best that may be,       So well doth the weather         And our stomachs agree.        \"Observe how the chimneys         Do smoak all about,       The cooks are providing         For dinner no doubt;       But those on whose tables         No victuals appear,       _O may they keep Lent         All the rest of the year_!\"    The same author quotes, from a manuscript in the British Museum, an  Anglo-Norman carol of the early date of the thirteenth century, and  appends to it a translation by the late Mr. Douce, the following verse  of which translation informs us (what, at any rate, might well be  supposed, namely) that so much good eating on the part of the ancient  gentleman, Christmas, would naturally suggest the propriety of good  drinking, too:--        \"Lordings, Christmas loves good drinking,         Wines of Gascoigne, France, Anjou,       English ale, that drives out thinking,         Prince of liquors old or new.       Every neighbor shares the bowl,         Drinks of the spicy liquor deep,       Drinks his fill without controul,         Till he drowns his care in sleep.\"    In a \"Christmas Carroll,\" printed at the end of Wither's \"Juvenilia,\" a  graphic account is given of some of the humors of Christmas, among which  the labors of the kitchen are introduced in the _first_ verse, with a  due regard to their right of precedency, and in words which, if few, are  full of suggestion:--        \"Lo, now is come our joyful'st feast!         Let every man be jolly.       Each roome with yvie leaves is drest,         And every post with holly.       Now, all our neighbour's chimneys smoke,         And Christmas Blocks are burning;       Their ovens they with bak't-meats choke,         And all their spits are turning.\"    We must present our readers with another quotation from an old ballad,  entitled \"Time's Alteration; or, The Old Man's Rehearsal, what brave  dayes he knew a great while agone, when his old cap was new,\" which  appears to have been written after the times of the Commonwealth. And  this extract we are induced to add to those which have gone before,  because, though it deals with precisely the same subjects, it speaks of  them as of things gone by, and is written in a tone of lamentation, in  which it is one of the purposes of this chapter to call upon our readers  to join. We are sorry we cannot give them directions as to the tune to  which it should be sung,--further than that it is obviously unsuited to  that of the \"Delights of the Bottle,\" prescribed for the joyous ballad  from which we first quoted on this subject; and that, whatever may be  the _tune_, we are clear that the direction as to _time_ should be the  same as that which Mr. Hood prefixes to his song of the Guildhall  Giants; namely, \"Dinner-time and mournful\":--        \"A man might then behold,         At Christmas in each hall,       Good fires to curb the cold,         And meat for great and small;       The neighbours were friendly bidden,         And all had welcome true,       The poor from the gates were not chidden,         When this old cap was new.        \"Black-jacks to every man         Were fill'd with wine and beer;       No pewter pot nor can         In those days did appear;       Good cheer in a nobleman's house         Was counted a seemly shew;       We wanted no brawn nor souse,         When this old cap was new.\"    Can our readers bear, after this sad ditty, to listen to the enumeration  of good things described by Whistlecraft to have been served up at King  Arthur's table on Christmas day? If the list be authentic, there is the  less reason to wonder at the feats of courage and strength performed by  the Knights of the Round Table.        \"They served up salmon, venison, and wild boars,       By hundreds, and by dozens, and by scores.        \"Hogsheads of honey, kilderkins of mustard,         Muttons, and fatted beeves, and bacon swine;       Herons and bitterns, peacocks, swan, and bustard,         Teal, mallard, pigeons, widgeons, and, in fine,       Plum-puddings, pancakes, apple-pies, and custard.         And therewithal they drank good Gascon wine,       With mead, and ale, and cider of our own;       For porter, punch, and negus were not known.\"    But we cannot pursue this matter further. It is not to be treated with  any degree of calmness before dinner, and we have not dined. We must  proceed to less trying parts of our subject.    Of the earnest manner in which our ancestors set about the celebration  of this festival, the mock ceremonial with which they illustrated it,  the quaint humors which they let loose under its inspiration, and the  spirit of fellowship which brought all classes of men within the range  of its beneficent provisions, we have a large body of scattered  evidence, to be gleaned out of almost every species of existing record,  from the early days of the Norman dynasty down to the times of the  Commonwealth. The tales of chroniclers, the olden ballads, the rolls of  courts, and the statute-book of the land, all contribute to"]]]
