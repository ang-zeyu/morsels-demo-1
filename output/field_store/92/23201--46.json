As he had been unjust in the first instance, he became  cowardly in the second, and taught his enemies (for so the crusaders  were forced to consider themselves) a lesson which they took care to  remember to his cost, that they could hope nothing from his sense of  justice, but every thing from his fears. Godfrey remained encamped for  several weeks in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, to the great  annoyance of Alexius, who sought by every means to extort from him the  homage he had extorted from Vermandois. Sometimes he acted as if at  open and declared war with the crusaders, and sent his troops against  them.  Sometimes he refused to supply them with food, and ordered the  markets to be shut against them, while at other times he was all for  peace and goodwill, and sent costly presents to Godfrey. The honest,  straightforward crusader was at last so wearied by his false kindness,  and so pestered by his attacks, that, allowing his indignation to get  the better of his judgment, he gave up the country around  Constantinople to be plundered by his soldiers. For six days the flames  of the farm-houses around struck terror into the heart of Alexius, but  as Godfrey anticipated they convinced him of his error.  Fearing that  Constantinople itself would be the next object of attack, he sent  messengers to demand an interview with Godfrey, offering at the same  time to leave his son as a hostage for his good faith.  Godfrey agreed  to meet him, and, whether to put an end to these useless dissensions,  or for some other unexplained reason, he rendered homage to Alexius as  his liege lord. He was thereupon loaded with honours, and, according to  a singular custom of that age, underwent the ceremony of the \"adoption  of honour,\" as son to the Emperor.  Godfrey, and his brother Baudouin  de Bouillon, conducted themselves with proper courtesy on this  occasion, but were not able to restrain the insolence of their  followers, who did not conceive themselves bound to keep any terms with  a man so insincere as he had shown himself. One barbarous chieftain,  Count Robert of Paris, carried his insolence so far as to seat himself  upon the throne, an insult which Alexius merely resented with a sneer,  but which did not induce him to look with less mistrust upon the hordes  that were still advancing.    It is impossible, notwithstanding his treachery, to avoid feeling some  compassion for the Emperor, whose life at this time was rendered one  long scene of misery by the presumption of the crusaders, and his not  altogether groundless fears of the evil they might inflict upon him,  should any untoward circumstance force the current of their ambition to  the conquest of his empire. His daughter, Anna Comnena, feelingly  deplores his state of life at this time, and a learned German, [M.  Wilken's Geschichte der Kreuzzuge.] in a recent work, describes it, on  the authority of the Princess, in the following manner:--    \"To avoid all occasion of offence to the Crusaders, Alexius complied  with all their whims, and their (on many occasions) unreasonable  demands, even at the expense of great bodily exertion, at a time when  he was suffering severely under the gout, which eventually brought him  to his grave. No crusader who desired an interview with him was refused  access: he listened with the utmost patience to the long-winded  harangues which their loquacity or zeal continually wearied him with:  he endured, without expressing any impatience, the unbecoming and  haughty language which they permitted themselves to employ towards him,  and severely reprimanded his officers when they undertook to defend the  dignity of the Imperial station from these rude assaults; for he  trembled with apprehension at the slightest disputes, lest they might  become the occasion of greater evil. Though the Counts often appeared  before him with trains altogether unsuitable to their dignity and to  his--sometimes with an entire troop, which completely filled the Royal  apartment--the Emperor held his peace.  He listened to them at all  hours; he often seated himself on his throne at day-break to attend to  their wishes and requests, and the evening twilight saw him still in  the same place. Very frequently he could not snatch time to refresh  himself with meat and drink. During many nights he could not obtain any  repose, and was obliged to indulge in an unrefreshing sleep upon his  throne, with his head resting on his hands. Even this slumber was  continually disturbed by the appearance and harangues of some  newly-arrived rude knights. When all the courtiers, wearied out by the  efforts of the day and by night-watching, could no longer keep  themselves on their feet, and sank down exhausted--some upon benches  and others on the floor--Alexius still rallied his strength to listen  with seeming attention to the wearisome chatter of the Latins, that  they might have no occasion or pretext for discontent. In such a state  of fear and anxiety, how could Alexius comport himself with dignity and  like an Emperor?\"    Alexius, however, had himself to blame, in a great measure, for the  indignities he suffered: owing to his insincerity, the crusaders  mistrusted him so much, that it became at last a common saying, that  the Turks and Saracens were not such inveterate foes to the Western or  Latin Christians as the Emperor Alexius and the Greeks.[Wilken] It  would be needless in this sketch, which does not profess to be so much  a history of the Crusades as of the madness of Europe, from which they  sprang, to detail the various acts of bribery and intimidation,  cajolery and hostility, by which Alexius contrived to make each of the  leaders in succession, as they arrived, take the oath of allegiance to  him as their Suzerain. One way or another he exacted from each the  barren homage on which he had set his heart, and they were then allowed  to proceed into Asia Minor. One only, Raymond de St. Gilles, Count of  Toulouse, obstinately refused the homage.    Their residence in Constantinople was productive of no good to the  armies of the Cross. Bickerings and contentions on the one hand, and  the influence of a depraved and luxurious court on the other, destroyed  the elasticity of their spirits, and cooled the first ardour of their  enthusiasm. At one time the army of the Count of Toulouse was on the  point of disbanding itself; and, had not their leader energetically  removed them across the Bosphorus, this would have been the result.  Once in Asia, their spirits in some degree revived, and the presence of  danger and difficulty nerved them to the work they had undertaken. The  first operation of the war was the siege of Nice, to gain possession of  which all their efforts were directed.    Godfrey of Bouillon and the Count of Vermandois were joined under its  walls by each host in succession, as it left Constantinople. Among the  celebrated crusaders who fought at this siege, we find, besides the  leaders already mentioned, the brave and generous Tancred, whose name  and fame have been immortalized in the Gerusalemme Liberata, the  valorous Bishop of Puy, Baldwin, afterwards King of Jerusalem, and  Peter the Hermit, now an almost solitary soldier, shorn of all the  power and influence he had formerly possessed. Kilij Aslaun, the Sultan  of Roum, and chief of the Seljukian Turks, whose deeds, surrounded by  the false halo of romance, are familiar to the readers of Tasso, under  the name of Soliman, marched to defend this city, but was defeated  after several obstinate engagements, in which the Christians showed a  degree of heroism that quite astonished him. The Turkish chief had  expected to find a wild undisciplined multitude, like that under Peter  the Hermit, without leaders capable of enforcing obedience; instead of  which he found the most experienced leaders of the age at the head of  armies that had just fanaticism enough to be ferocious, but not enough  to render them ungovernable. In these engagements, many hundreds fell  on both sides; and on both sides the most revolting barbarity was  practised: the crusaders cut off the heads of the fallen Mussulmans,  and sent them in paniers to Constantinople, as trophies of their  victory. After the temporary defeat of Kilij Aslaun, the siege of Nice  was carried on with redoubled vigour. The Turks defended themselves  with the greatest obstinacy, and discharged showers of poisoned arrows  upon the crusaders. When any unfortunate wretch was killed under the  walls, they let down iron hooks from above, and drew the body up,  which, after stripping and mutilating, they threw back again at the  besiegers. The latter were well supplied with provisions, and for  six-and-thirty days the siege continued without any relaxation of the  efforts on either side. Many tales are told of the almost superhuman  heroism of the Christian leaders--how one man put a thousand to flight;  and how the arrows of the faithful never missed their mark.  One  anecdote of Godfrey of Bouillon, related by Albert of Aix, is worth  recording, not only as showing the high opinion entertained of his  valour, but as showing the contagious credulity of the armies--a  credulity which as often led them to the very verge of defeat, as it  incited them to victory. One Turk, of gigantic stature, took his  station day by day on the battlements of Nice, and, bearing an enormous  bow, committed great havoc among the Christian host. Not a shaft he  sped, but bore death upon its point; and, although the Crusaders aimed  repeatedly at his breast, and he stood in the most exposed position,  their arrows fell harmless at his feet. He seemed to be invulnerable to  attack; and a report was soon spread abroad, that he was no other than  the Arch Fiend himself, and that mortal hand could not prevail against  him.

There he is!\" the brother yelled, as getting over the  edge of the hill Tom was now in full view of the pond.    \"And in the boat,\" called Harry, close at Tom's heels.    \"He's drifting away!\" screamed Bert. \"Oh, quick, save him!\"    Just as the boys said, the little fellow was in the boat and drifting.    He did not seem to realize his danger, for as he floated along he ran  his little fat hand through the water as happily as if he had been in a  steam launch, talking to the captain.    \"Can you swim?\" the boys asked Bert, who of course had learned that  useful art long ago.    \"She's quite a long way out,\" Tom said,    \"But we must be careful not to frighten him. See, he has left the oars  here. Bert and I can carry one out and swim with one hand. Harry and  Jack, can you manage the other?\"    The boys said they could, and quickly as the heaviest clothes could be  thrown off they were striking out in the little lake toward the baby in  the boat. He was only Freddie's age, you know, and perhaps more of a  baby than the good-natured Bobbsey boy.    \"Sit still, Roy,\" called the anxious girl from the shore, fearing Roy  would upset the boat as the boys neared him. It was hard work to swim  and carry oars, but our brave boys managed to do it in time to save  Roy. For not a great way down the stream were an old water wheel and a  dam. Should the boat drift there what would become of little Roy?    Mrs. Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah were worrying over this as the boys were  making their way to the boat.    \"Easy now!\" called Bert. \"Here we are,\" and at that moment the first  pair of swimmers climbed carefully into the boat, one from each side,  so as not to tip it over. Jack and Harry were not long in following,  and as the boys all sat in the pretty green rowboat with their white  under-clothing answering for athletic suits, they looked just like a  crew of real oarsmen.    \"Hurrah, hurrah!\" came shout after shout from the bank. Then as the  girls heard the rumble of wheels through the grove they all hurried off  to gather up the stuff quickly, and be ready to start as soon as the  boys dressed again. The wet under-clothing, of course, was carried home  in one of the empty baskets that Freddie ran back over the hill with to  save the tired boys the extra walk.    \"Here they are! Here they are!\" called the girls as the two little  fellows, Roy and Freddie, with the basket of wet clothes between them,  marched first; then came the two pairs of athletes who proved they were  good swimmers by pushing the heavy oars safely to the drifting boat.    \"And all the things that happened!\" exclaimed Flossie, as John handed  her into the hay wagon.    \"That made the picnic lively!\" declared, John, \"and all's well that  ends well, you know.\"  So the picnic was over, and all were happy and  tired enough to go to bed early that night, as Nan said, seeing the  little ones falling asleep in hay wagon on their way home.        CHAPTER IX    FOURTH OF JULY    The day following the picnic was July third, and as the Meadow Brook  children were pretty well tired out from romping in the woods, they  were glad of a day's rest before entering upon the festivities of  Independence Day.    \"How much have you got?\" Tom Mason asked the Bobbsey boys.    \"Fifty cents together, twenty-five cents each,\" Harry announced.    \"Well, I've got thirty-five, and we had better get our stuff early, for  Stimpson sold out before noon last year,\" concluded Tom.    \"I have to get torpedoes for Freddie and Flossie, and Chinese  fire-crackers for Nan,\" Bert remarked, as they started for the little  country grocery store.    \"I guess I'll buy a few snakes, they look so funny coiling out,\" Tom  said.    \"I'm going to have sky rockets and Roman candles. Everybody said they  were the prettiest last year,\" said Harry.    \"If they have red fire I must get some of it for the girls,\" thoughtful  Bert remarked.    But at the store the boys had to take just what they could get, as  Stimpson's supply was very limited.    \"Let's make up a parade!\" someone suggested, and this being agreed upon  the boys started a canvass from house to house, to get all the boys  along Meadow Brook road to take part in the procession.    \"Can the little ones come too?\" August Stout asked, because he always  had to look out for his small brother when there was any danger like  fireworks around.    \"Yes, and we're goin' to let the girls march in a division by  themselves,\" Bert told him. \"My sister Nan is going to be captain, and  we'll leave all the girls' parts to her.\"    \"Be sure and bring your flag,\" Harry cautioned Jack Hopkins.    \"How would the goat wagons do?\" Jack asked.    \"Fine; we could let Roy and Freddie ride in them,\" said Bert. \"Tell any  of the other fellows who have goat teams to bring them along too.\"    \"Eight o'clock sharp at our lane,\" Harry told them for the place and  time of meeting. Then they went along to finish the arrangements.    \"Don't tell the boys,\" Nan whispered to Mildred, as they too made their  way to Stimpson's.    \"Won't they be surprised?\" exclaimed Mabel.    \"Yes, and I am going to carry a real Betsy Ross flag, one with thirteen  stars, you know.\"    \"Oh, yes, Betsy Ross made the first flag, didn't she?\" remarked  Mildred, trying to catch up on history.    \"We'll have ten big girls,\" Nan counted. \"Then with Flossie as Liberty  we will want Bessie and Nettie for her assistants.\"    \"Attendants,\" Mabel corrected, for she had seen a city parade like that  once.    It was a busy day for everybody, and when Mr. Bobbsey came up on the  train from Lakeport that evening he carried boxes and boxes of  fireworks for the boys and girls, and even some for the grown folks too.    The girls could hardly sleep that night, they were so excited over  their part, but the boys of course were used to that sort of thing, and  only slept sounder with the fun in prospect.    \"Are you awake, Bert?\" called Harry, so early the next morning that the  sun was hardly up yet.    \"Yep,\" replied the cousin, jumping out of bed and hastily dressing for  the firing of the first gun.    The boys crept through the house very quietly, then ran to the barn for  their ammunition. Three big giant fire-crackers were placed in the road  directly in front of the house.    \"Be careful!\" whispered Bert; \"they're full of powder.\"    But Harry was always careful with fireworks, and when he touched the  fuses to the \"cannons\" he made away quickly before they exploded.    Bang! Bang! Bang!    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Freddie, answering the call from his window, \"I'll be  right down!\"    All the others too were aroused by the first \"guns,\" so that in a very  short time there were many boys in the road, firing so many kinds of  fire-crackers that Meadow Brook resounded like a real war fort under  fire.    \"Ouch!\" yelled Tom Mason, the first one to bum his fingers. \"A sisser  caught me right on the thumb.\"    But such small accidents were not given much attention, and soon Tom  was lighting the little red crackers as merrily as before.    \"Go on back, girls!\" called Bert. \"You'll get your dresses burnt if you  don't.\"    The girls were coming too near the battlements then, and Bert did well  to warn them off.    Freddie and Flossie were having a great time throwing their little  torpedoes at Mr. Bobbsey and Uncle Daniel, who were seated on the  piazza watching the sport. Snoop and Fluffy too came in for a scare,  for Freddie tossed a couple of torpedoes on the kitchen hearth where  the kittens were sleeping.    The boys were having such fun they could hardly be induced to come in  for breakfast, but they finally did stop long enough to eat a spare  meal.    \"It's time to get ready!\" whispered Nan to Bert, for the parade had  been kept secret from the grown folks.    At the girls' place of meeting, the coach house, Nan found all her  company waiting and anxious to dress.    \"Just tie your scarfs loose under your left arm,\" ordered Captain Nan,  and the girls quickly obeyed like true cadets. The broad  red-white-and-blue bunting was very pretty over the girls' white  dresses, and indeed the \"cadets\" looked as if they would outdo the  \"regulars\" unless the boys too had surprises in store.    \"Where's Nettie?\" suddenly asked Nan, missing a poor little girl who  had been invited.    \"She wouldn't come because she had no white dress,\" Mildred answered.    \"Oh, what a shame; she'll be so disappointed! Besides, we need her to  make a full line,\" Nan said. \"Just wait a minute. Lock the door after  me,\" and before the others knew what she was going to do, Nan ran off  to the house, got one of her own white dresses, rolled it up neatly,  and was over the fields to Nettie's house in a few minutes. When Nan  came back she brought Nettie with her, and not one of her companions  knew it was Nan's dress that Nettie wore.    Soon all the scarfs were tied and the flags arranged. Then Flossie had  to be dressed.    She wore a light blue dress with gold stars on it, and on her pretty  yellow curls she had a real Liberty crown. Then she had the cleanest,  brightest flag, and what a pretty picture she made!    \"Oh, isn't she sweet!\" all the girls exclaimed in admiration, and  indeed she was a little beauty in her Liberty costume.    \"There go the drums!\" Nan declared. \"We must be careful to get down the  lane without being seen.\" This was easily managed, and now the girls  and boys met at the end of the lane.    \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted the boys, beating the drums and blowing their  horns to welcome the girls.    \"Oh, don't you look fine!\" exclaimed Harry, who was captain of the boys.    \"And don't you too!\" Nan answered, for indeed the boys had such funny  big hats on and so many flags and other red-white-and-blue things, that  they too made a fine appearance.    \"And Freddie!\" exclaimed the girls. \"Isn't he a lovely Uncle Sam!\"    Freddie was dressed in the striped suit Uncle Sam always wears, and had  on his"]]]
