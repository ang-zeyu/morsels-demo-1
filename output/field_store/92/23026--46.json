In fact the wind was with difficulty kept outside at all, and at  intervals would knock savagely at the frosted pane, or shout down the  chimney, to the great amusement of the good-humored fire.    Now if there is anything I particularly like, it is the sound of a  furious northeaster in the chimney on such a night as this. So I sat  there, watching the dancing flames, feeling the grateful warmth  beginning to creep through the soles of my slippers, and listening to  my boisterous friend outside, when I became conscious of a curious  optical effect in one of the black marble pillars which supported my  mantel. As the shadows flitted to and fro about its Ionic scrolls, it  looked exactly as if it were nodding its head, and the fringe of the  lambrequin hung out over its forehead like a mass of disheveled hair.  Yielding myself wholly to the queer fancy, I was not at all surprised  to have the pillar straighten itself up until it was nearly six feet  tall, and ask me in rather a severe voice what I meant by translating  _notus_, \"northeast wind?\"    \"I didn't mean to, sir,\" I stammered, feeling all at once greatly in  awe of the projecting tuft of hair that loomed up threateningly over  me. \"I suppose it was because it was snowing, and the northeast wind  is really\"--Here I paused, for I happened to glance at the window as I  spoke, and behold, there was no sign of frost or snow on the dusty  pane. I looked foolish and--I had scrambled to my feet when the  question was asked--sat down hastily.    \"Next!\" said the tall figure, bending its dark brows on a boy who had  glided in unobserved and taken his seat beside me. While he was  translating in a hesitating and monotonous voice what seemed to be a  passage from Virgil, I had time to look about me, at the same time  experiencing an odd sensation of waking up after a long sleep. It had  been a wild, strange dream, then,--my college life, my adventures  abroad, my business and its cares. Yes, even the few gray hairs that  had begun to peep around my ears were but fancied symptoms of maturity  and age. For here I was, where of course I ought to be, sitting on a  hard bench, Virgil in hand, following the recitation and reading ahead  hurriedly about where I thought my turn would come. Every moment the  scene became more natural, and the dream-life of my manhood more and  more indistinct. The old head master, Francis Gardner, whom I now  recognized beyond all doubt, soon reached my end of the class once  more, but before he could call on me to translate, the hands of the  clock touched eleven, and we were dismissed for recess.    Down we poured over the long, worn staircase, which trembled under our  tread, one flight after another, until we reached the yard. Here we  played our old games, running to and fro between the high brick walls,  and dodging around their sharp angles. At length the bell--I can hear  its exact tones now--called to us from a window overhead, and we  scrambled up again, taking our places at our desks with just as much  bustle and interchange of sly thrusts as we dared. One boy was late,  and the Doctor met him at the threshold.    \"Now, sir,\" said he sternly, looking down at the culprit, and fixing  upon him a glance which I never knew to fail of inspiring awe, \"Now,  sir, do you want a rasping?\" The boy shuffled his feet back and forth  on the floor, twisted his hat in his hands, and began to mumble an  excuse.    \"Look here,\" said the tall figure, \"you can take either of the two  horns of the dilemma,\" holding up two fingers. \"Either you went so far  away that you couldn't hear the bell, or you didn't start when you did  hear it. Which horn will you take?\"    How that boy trembled as he surveyed those long, gaunt fingers on  which hung his fate! Foolish fellow, not to know the warm heart that  was beating behind all the kind old Doctor's frowns! For do I not  remember his many gentle deeds, often done in secret and found out by  accident? It seems only yesterday, when, having sent one of his  scholars away in disgrace, and learned a few days later that the boy  was at home and sick, he had misgivings that he had been unjust, and  appeared at that boy's door after school hours with a bouquet at least  a foot in diameter, and the injunction--awkwardly enough given--that  the boy should not be worried about what had occurred, nor about the  lessons he was losing. Feeble as he was, with age and disease fast  laying hold upon him, the head master had traversed the entire breadth  of the city in the dead of winter to leave this message for the pupil  he feared he had wronged.    While I was reflecting upon these things the Doctor had finished his  rebuke to the tardy boy and left the room. Others came and went. The  boys' faces were all familiar, and my heart brimmed over with delight  as I recognized those whom, in my dream of college and business, I had  thought of as sober, work-a-day men. Here was the round-eyed,  mischievous fellow whom I had fancied to be a learned physician;  another, a librarian; a third, a student and teacher of German, but  now, bereft of whiskers and bass voice, once more a boy, and the  scapegrace of the class. Then there were the teachers. One, whose  fair, scholarly face I had never expected to see again on this earth,  was busily explaining a Latin exercise to the class, with the aid of  several old vellum-bound books he had brought from his own private  library. Another bustled in with a carpetbag and a hearty, cheery air;  compared the school clock with his watch (of whose almost superhuman  accuracy we boys always stood in awe), and heard us recite in French.  This lesson passed off with a briskness and good will that waked us  all up as if we had been out in the fresh air, and left us keen for  the next study. Meanwhile I caught glimpses of other teachers, all  more or less associated with the dearest and best days of my life.  There was he who once invited us all out to skate on his pond, in the  country; who knew how to be stern with wrong-doers, but who was known  to stay late in the afternoon, day after day, to hear a sick boy  recite lessons in his home, that the little fellow might not fall  behind his class, and so lose a possible chance for a prize. In my  after-dream, his hair had been threaded with gray; but now it was  brown, as I remembered it of old. Still another was a young man whose  even-handed justice--\"squareness,\" we used to call it--was proverbial  among my schoolmates. I had heard that his own son had since grown old  enough to pass through college most honorably, and that he himself had  taken the place of the grim Doctor in some strange air-castle of a new  schoolhouse, far from its former site. Now I realized that I was back  in the old days, and laughed to myself so loud that nothing but a  disingenuous cough, into which I dexterously turned my mirth, saved me  a mark for misconduct.    But now the room was hushed, as the master addressed us in quiet,  earnest tones. He was bidding us good-bye for a few days, and ended by  wishing us all a Merry Christmas.    Bless me, how we did throng around the desk on our way out, and return  his hearty greeting! In spite of my sense of the reality of the whole  scene, I could not dispel a strange foreboding that I was saying  farewell to school and master forever. The twilight shadows of the  short winter afternoon--it was storming furiously now, and had grown  quite dark within doors--gathered about the old man's form as he sat  there shaking hands with one after the other, his eyes twinkling in  their deep sockets, and meeting with kindly glance the fresh young boy  faces around him. In a moment more this was all forgotten, for we had  reached the street, and were rioting about in the snow as only boys  let out from school for a week's vacation can do. How we did assail  policemen and wagon-drivers and pretty girls, to be sure! These last  were on their way home from school, too, and many were the laughing  glances and shy smiles that were flung us in return for our harmless  pats of snow.    Full of the merriment of the day, although not yet aware that it was  really Christmas Eve, I made my way up to Boylston Market, which was  completely transfigured from a rather jail-like and dreary receptacle  for unpleasantly red shoulders of mutton and beef, to a wonderland of  evergreen and holly; it had not yet given place to a great dry-goods  emporium. Here I saw my former teachers--God bless them, every  one!--approach in a group, very much like boys themselves, for the  time, and select various wreaths and bunches of green for home. I  touched my \"B. L. S.\" cap respectfully as they passed, but a flurry of  snow came between and they did not see me. I stretched out my hand to  them, but they were gone. Again the aching sense of loss, the dread of  finding that I was in the midst of unrealities came over me, and I  shivered from head to foot. Pulling my cap low over my ears, I hurried  back to Bedford Street. Alas! my worst fears were realized. The old  schoolhouse was gone. Strange faces stared at me through the darkening  storm. I leaned against the black iron fence, which still remained,  and hid my face in my hands. As I did so, the wind moaned drearily  overhead, and I heard the snow and sleet drifting against--what? My  own window-panes!    Yes, the dream was truth, and the truth was a dream. I shivered again,  in my easy chair, felt of my beard, stretched myself and rose stiffly  to my feet. The fire had burned low, had fallen in entirely between  the andirons, and the room was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#7)"],[1,"rivolous, useless, and burdensome; the latter is  absolutely requisite to the well-being of mankind and existence of  society. When we abstract from this circumstance (for it is too apparent  ever to be overlooked) it must be confessed, that all regards to right  and property, seem entirely without foundation, as much as the grossest  and most vulgar superstition. Were the interests of society nowise  concerned, it is as unintelligible why another's articulating certain  sounds implying consent, should change the nature of my actions with  regard to a particular object, as why the reciting of a liturgy by a  priest, in a certain habit and posture, should dedicate a heap of brick  and timber, and render it, thenceforth and for ever, sacred.           [Footnote: It is evident, that the will or consent alone never  transfers property, nor causes the obligation of a promise (for the same  reasoning extends to both), but the will must be expressed by words or  signs, in order to impose a tie upon any man. The expression being once  brought in as subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part  of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, though he  secretly give a different direction to his intention, and withhold the  assent of his mind. But though the expression makes, on most occasions,  the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one who should  make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which  he uses without any sense of the consequences, would not certainly be  bound by it. Nay, though he know its meaning, yet if he use it in jest  only, and with such signs as evidently show, that he has no serious  intention of binding himself, he would not lie under any obligation of  performance; but it is necessary, that the words be a perfect expression  of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must  not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of  understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention  of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if  we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases where  the signs are of a different nature from those of deceit. All these  contradictions are easily accounted for, if justice arise entirely from  its usefulness to society; but will never be explained on any other  hypothesis.       It is remarkable that the moral decisions of the JESUITS and other  relaxed casuists, were commonly formed in prosecution of some such  subtilties of reasoning as are here pointed out, and proceed as much  from the habit of scholastic refinement as from any corruption of  the heart, if we may follow the authority of Mons. Bayle. See his  Dictionary, article Loyola. And why has the indignation of mankind risen  so high against these casuists; but because every one perceived, that  human society could not subsist were such practices authorized, and that  morals must always be handled with a view to public interest, more than  philosophical regularity? If the secret direction of the intention, said  every man of sense, could invalidate a contract; where is our security?  And yet a metaphysical schoolman might think, that, where an intention  was supposed to be requisite, if that intention really had not place,  no consequence ought to follow, and no obligation be imposed. The  casuistical subtilties may not be greater than the snbtilties of  lawyers, hinted at above; but as the former are PERNICIOUS, and the  latter INNOCENT and even NECESSARY, this is the reason of the very  different reception they meet with from the world.       It is a doctrine of the Church of Rome, that the priest, by a secret  direction of his intention, can invalidate any sacrament. This position  is derived from a strict and regular prosecution of the obvious truth,  that empty words alone, without any meaning or intention in the speaker,  can never be attended with any effect. If the same conclusion be not  admitted in reasonings concerning civil contracts, where the affair is  allowed to be of so much less consequence than the eternal salvation  of thousands, it proceeds entirely from men's sense of the danger and  inconvenience of the doctrine in the former case: And we may  thence observe, that however positive, arrogant, and dogmatical any  superstition may appear, it never can convey any thorough persuasion  of the reality of its objects, or put them, in any degree, on a balance  with the common incidents of life, which we learn from daily observation  and experimental reasoning.]      These reflections are far from weakening the obligations of justice, or  diminishing anything from the most sacred attention to property. On  the contrary, such sentiments must acquire new force from the present  reasoning. For what stronger foundation can be desired or conceived for  any duty, than to observe, that human society, or even human nature,  could not subsist without the establishment of it; and will still arrive  at greater degrees of happiness and perfection, the more inviolable the  regard is, which is paid to that duty?    The dilemma seems obvious: As justice evidently tends to promote public  utility and to support civil society, the sentiment of justice is either  derived from our reflecting on that tendency, or like hunger, thirst,  and other appetites, resentment, love of life, attachment to offspring,  and other passions, arises from a simple original instinct in the human  breast, which nature has implanted for like salutary purposes. If the  latter be the case, it follows, that property, which is the object of  justice, is also distinguished by a simple original instinct, and is not  ascertained by any argument or reflection. But who is there that ever  heard of such an instinct? Or is this a subject in which new discoveries  can be made? We may as well expect to discover, in the body, new senses,  which had before escaped the observation of all mankind.    But farther, though it seems a very simple proposition to say, that  nature, by an instinctive sentiment, distinguishes property, yet in  reality we shall find, that there are required for that purpose ten  thousand different instincts, and these employed about objects of the  greatest intricacy and nicest discernment. For when a definition of  PROPERTY is required, that relation is found to resolve itself into  any possession acquired by occupation, by industry, by prescription, by  inheritance, by contract, &c. Can we think that nature, by an original  instinct, instructs us in all these methods of acquisition?    These words too, inheritance and contract, stand for ideas infinitely  complicated; and to define them exactly, a hundred volumes of laws, and  a thousand volumes of commentators, have not been found sufficient. Does  nature, whose instincts in men are all simple, embrace such complicated  and artificial objects, and create a rational creature, without trusting  anything to the operation of his reason?    But even though all this were admitted, it would not be satisfactory.  Positive laws can certainly transfer property. It is by another original  instinct, that we recognize the authority of kings and senates, and mark  all the boundaries of their jurisdiction? Judges too, even though their  sentence be erroneous and illegal, must be allowed, for the sake of  peace and order, to have decisive authority, and ultimately to determine  property. Have we original innate ideas of praetors and chancellors and  juries? Who sees not, that all these institutions arise merely from the  necessities of human society?    All birds of the same species in every age and country, built their  nests alike: In this we see the force of instinct. Men, in different  times and places, frame their houses differently: Here we perceive  the influence of reason and custom. A like inference may be drawn from  comparing the instinct of generation and the institution of property.    How great soever the variety of municipal laws, it must be confessed,  that their chief outlines pretty regularly concur; because the purposes,  to which they tend, are everywhere exactly similar. In like manner, all  houses have a roof and walls, windows and chimneys; though diversified  in their shape, figure, and materials. The purposes of the latter,  directed to the conveniencies of human life, discover not more plainly  their origin from reason and reflection, than do those of the former,  which point all to a like end.    I need not mention the variations, which all the rules of property  receive from the finer turns and connexions of the imagination, and from  the subtilties and abstractions of law-topics and reasonings. There is  no possibility of reconciling this observation to the notion of original  instincts.    What alone will beget a doubt concerning the theory, on which I insist,  is the influence of education and acquired habits, by which we are  so accustomed to blame injustice, that we are not, in every instance,  conscious of any immediate reflection on the pernicious consequences of  it. The views the most familiar to us are apt, for that very reason,  to escape us; and what we have very frequently performed from certain  motives, we are apt likewise to continue mechanically, without  recalling, on every occasion, the reflections, which first determined  us. The convenience, or rather necessity, which leads to justice is so  universal, and everywhere points so much to the same rules, that the  habit takes place in all societies; and it is not without some scrutiny,  that we are able to ascertain its true origin. The matter, however,  is not so obscure, but that even in common life we have every moment  recourse to the principle of public utility, and ask, WHAT MUST BECOME  OF THE WORLD, IF SUCH PRACTICES PREVAIL? HOW COULD SOCIETY SUBSIST  UNDER SUCH DISORDERS? Were the distinction or separation of possessions  entirely useless, "]]]
