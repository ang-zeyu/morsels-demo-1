On the other hand, there was the  expression of the fear that strict measures would only exasperate the  people. He himself was in favour of reasonable strictness as the  proper attitude in the presence of a grave national danger, and he  further affirmed that exceptional regulations for a time of invasion,  the necessity of which every man of sense could understand, if clearly  explained and firmly adhered to, were not only not incompatible with,  but actually conducive to, the avoidance of injustice and cruelty. He  went on to say:--    [Illustration: DE WET'S RUSH IN CAPE COLONY _VIA_ ZAND DRIFT, 10TH  FEBRUARY 1901]    \"I am satisfied by experience that the majority of those Dutch  inhabitants of the Colony who sympathise with the Republics, however  little they may be able to resist giving active expression to that  sympathy when the enemy actually appear amongst them, do not desire to  see their own districts invaded or to find themselves personally  placed in the awkward dilemma of choosing between high treason and an  unfriendly attitude to the men of their own race from beyond the  border. There are extremists who would like to see the whole of the  Cape Colony overrun. But the bulk of the farmers, especially the  substantial ones, are not of this mind. They submit readily enough  even to stringent regulations having for their object the prevention  of the spread of invasion. And not a few of them are, perhaps,  secretly glad that the prohibition of seditious speaking and writing,  of political meetings, and of the free movement of political  firebrands through the country, enables them to keep quiet, without  actually themselves taking a strong line against the propaganda, and,  to do them justice, they behave reasonably well under the pass and  other regulations necessary for that purpose, as long as care is taken  not to make these regulations too irksome to them in the conduct of  their business, or in their daily lives.\"    He suggested that the fact that there had been an invasion at all was  no doubt due to the weakness of some of the Dutch colonists in  tolerating, or supporting, the violent propaganda, which could not but  lead the enemy to believe that they had only to come into the Colony  in order to meet with general active support. But this had been a  miscalculation on the part of the enemy, though a very pardonable one.  They knew the vehemence of the agitation in their favour as shown by  the speeches in Parliament, the series of public meetings culminating  in the Worcester Congress, the writings of the Dutch press, the very  general wearing of the Republican colours, the singing of the  Volkslied, and so forth, and they regarded these demonstrations as  meaning more than they actually did. Three things were forgotten.  Firstly, that a great proportion of the Afrikanders in the Colony who  really meant business, had slipped away and joined the Republican  ranks long ago. Secondly, that the abortive rebellion of a year ago  had left the people of the border districts disinclined to repeat the  experiment of a revolt. Thirdly, that owing to the precautionary  measures of the Government the amount of arms and ammunition in the  hands of the country population throughout the greater part of the  Colony is not now anything like as large as it usually was, and far  smaller than it was at the onset of the war.    In regard to the \"call to arms\" that took place on the 1st of January,  and the vehement response it had met, Lord Milner stated that it had  always been admitted, by their friends and foes alike, that the bulk  of the Afrikander population would never take up arms on the side of  the British Government in this quarrel, even for local defence. The  appeal therefore had been virtually directed to the British  population, mostly townspeople, and to a small, but no doubt very  strong and courageous, minority of the Afrikanders who have always  been loyalists. These classes had been already immensely drawn on by  the Cape Police, the regular Volunteer Corps, and the numerous  Irregular Mounted Corps which had been called into existence because  of the war. There must have been 12,000 Cape colonists under arms  before the recent appeal, and as things were going, as many more  promised to answer that appeal--a truly remarkable achievement under a  purely voluntary system.    [Illustration: POSITION OF TROOPS AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT OF 23RD  FEBRUARY. DE WET'S ESCAPE FROM THE ENVELOPING CORDON, 28TH FEBRUARY  1901]    How gloriously the system worked throughout the year 1901 has yet to  be seen, for peace was still a great way off. All yearned for it, all  were fairly sick of carnage and ruin and sacrifice, but, nevertheless,  it was agreed that to endure and fight to the bitter end were  preferable to an ignoble compromise, which must inevitably bring about  a recurrence of the terrible scourge in the future. All were  determined that South Africa should become one country under one flag,  and that the British; and this once accomplished, they would be ready  to bury racial animosities for ever. But, in order to bring about that  happy, that inevitable end, all decided that a vigorous prosecution of  the war, at whatever cost, was an imperative duty.          CHAPTER I    CONTINUATION OF THE DE WET CHASE, 1ST TO 10TH MARCH--ACROSS THE ORANGE  RIVER      On the last day of February, as we know, De Wet and Steyn, with a  bedraggled, hungry commando of some fifteen hundred Boers,  precipitately crossed the Orange River at Lilliefontein, near  Colesberg Bridge. They were seen by some few men of Nesbitt's Horse  under Sergeant-Major Surworth, and promptly fired upon as men and  horses strove to battle with the current. This unlooked for attack  caused considerable dismay, so much so, that many Cape carts and some  clothing were left on the south bank, while several fugitives were  seen to be galloping off in Garden of Eden attire. Many Boers were  left in the neighbourhood of the Zeekoe River, and of these some  thirty-three were captured by Captain Dallimore and sixteen Victorian  Rifles.    The retirement becoming known to General Lyttelton, who was directing  the operations, the pursuing columns were ordered to converge on  Philippolis. General Plumer, Colonels Haig and Thorneycroft, entering  Orange River by Norval's Pont, operated from Springfontein to the  river, while General C. Knox and Colonel Bethune at Orange River  Bridge mounted guard there, and threatened such marauders as might  retire in their direction. On the arrival of General Plumer at  Philippolis, on the 3rd, he discovered that De Wet was fleeing to  Fauresmith, and Hertzog, with 500 men, was making for Luckhoff. He  therefore, with almost inexhaustible energy, instantly pursued the  great raider, and after a rearguard action on the 4th at Zuurfontein,  reached Fauresmith on the 5th, only to find the bird flown _via_ the  Petrusburg Road. On and on then went the troops, past Petrusburg--De  Wet ever twenty-four hours ahead--till they reached Abraham Kraal  Drift on the Modder River. By this time (the 7th) the Boer flock had  dispersed over the enormous track of country with which they are so  intimate, and De Wet himself vanished, as usual, into \"thin air.\" The  8th was spent in recuperation, replenishing stores, and gaining  information. On the following two days the northerly march was  continued in search of De Wet, who was reported to have crossed the  line (on the night of the 8th) on the way to Senekal. But, as the  redoubtable one trekked at the rate of some five miles a day more than  the best column, General Plumer gave him up as lost, and marched to  Brandfort, and thence proceeded under orders to Winburg. The chase had  been far from stimulating, for heavy rain had fallen, causing much  inconvenience to man and beast, and hindering transport operations.  The veldt, however, soon assumed a rich green garb, which rendered all  the English horses independent of the Commissariat Department.    Meanwhile Colonel Haig, in conjunction, had moved to Philippolis on  the 4th, only to learn that General Plumer was on the track of De Wet.  He therefore turned his attention to Hertzog, caught him on the 5th at  Grootfontein, ten miles north-west of Philippolis, engaged him and  forced him westward. He then waited orders at Springfontein lest a  more speedy movement by rail might be directed.    Colonel Bethune, in his position near Orange River Bridge, spent this  time in fighting and dispersing large bodies of raiders, passing at  length _via_ Petrusburg, on the 6th, to the line Abraham's Kraal,  Roodewal, on the 8th. Here he halted. An empty convoy returning from  him to Bloemfontein was attacked by the Boers, but the escort tackled  the enemy, and, with the assistance of the Prince of Wales' Light  Horse, put them to flight.    General C. Knox's columns (Colonels Pilcher and Crewe, moving by way  of Kalabas Bridge and Koffyfontein respectively), advanced at the same  time, reaching Bloemfontein on the 10th and 11th, the astute Pilcher  having captured a Boer laager by the way. He had three killed, eleven  wounded, three missing, and his captures included twenty-four  prisoners, 1500 horses, and some cattle.    Colonel Crewe engaged in a smart tussle with Brand's commando at  Olivenberg (south-west of Petrusburg), and reached his destination  _plus_ five prisoners, twenty-one waggons and carts with teams  complete, and 2000 horses.    During March, Major Goold-Adams, the Deputy-Administrator of the  Orange River Colony, in whom the burghers placed much confidence, bent  his mind to the organisation of the civil administration of the  colony. Mr. Conrad Linder, an ex-official of the late Government, was  provisionally appointed registrar. A scheme of education, based on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#7)"],[1," He allowed me to go off--with  the stones in my pocket!    Sir Charles had given me a blank cheque, not exceeding two thousand  five hundred pounds. I took it to our agents and cashed it for notes  of the Bank of France. The curate clasped them with pleasure. And  right glad I was to go back to Lucerne that night, feeling that I  had got those diamonds into my hands for about a thousand pounds  under their real value!    At Lucerne railway station Amelia met me. She was positively  agitated.    \"Have you bought them, Seymour?\" she asked.    \"Yes,\" I answered, producing my spoils in triumph.    \"Oh, how dreadful!\" she cried, drawing back. \"Do you think they're  real? Are you sure he hasn't cheated you?\"    \"Certain of it,\" I replied, examining them. \"No one can take me in,  in the matter of diamonds. Why on earth should you doubt them?\"    \"Because I've been talking to Mrs. O'Hagan, at the hotel, and she  says there's a well-known trick just like that--she's read of it in  a book. A swindler has two sets--one real, one false; and he makes  you buy the false ones by showing you the real, and pretending he  sells them as a special favour.\"    \"You needn't be alarmed,\" I answered. \"I am a judge of diamonds.\"    \"I shan't be satisfied,\" Amelia murmured, \"till Charles has seen  them.\"    We went up to the hotel. For the first time in her life I saw Amelia  really nervous as I handed the stones to Charles to examine. Her  doubt was contagious. I half feared, myself, he might break out into  a deep monosyllabic interjection, losing his temper in haste, as he  often does when things go wrong. But he looked at them with a smile,  while I told him the price.    \"Eight hundred pounds less than their value,\" he answered, well  satisfied.    \"You have no doubt of their reality?\" I asked.    \"Not the slightest,\" he replied, gazing at them. \"They are genuine  stones, precisely the same in quality and type as Amelia's necklet.\"    Amelia drew a sigh of relief. \"I'll go upstairs,\" she said slowly,  \"and bring down my own for you both to compare with them.\"    One minute later she rushed down again, breathless. Amelia is far  from slim, and I never before knew her exert herself so actively.    \"Charles, Charles!\" she cried, \"do you know what dreadful thing  has happened? Two of my own stones are gone. He's stolen a couple  of diamonds from my necklet, and sold them back to me.\"    She held out the riviere. It was all too true. Two gems were  missing--and these two just fitted the empty places!    A light broke in upon me. I clapped my hand to my head. \"By Jove,\"  I exclaimed, \"the little curate is--Colonel Clay!\"    Charles clapped his own hand to his brow in turn. \"And Jessie,\" he  cried, \"White Heather--that innocent little Scotchwoman! I often  detected a familiar ring in her voice, in spite of the charming  Highland accent. Jessie is--Madame Picardet!\"    We had absolutely no evidence; but, like the Commissary at Nice,  we felt instinctively sure of it.    Sir Charles was determined to catch the rogue. This second deception  put him on his mettle. \"The worst of the man is,\" he said, \"he has a  method. He doesn't go out of his way to cheat us; he makes us go out  of ours to be cheated. He lays a trap, and we tumble headlong into  it. To-morrow, Sey, we must follow him on to Paris.\"    Amelia explained to him what Mrs. O'Hagan had said. Charles took it  all in at once, with his usual sagacity. \"That explains,\" he said,  \"why the rascal used this particular trick to draw us on by. If we  had suspected him he could have shown the diamonds were real, and  so escaped detection. It was a blind to draw us off from the fact  of the robbery. He went to Paris to be out of the way when the  discovery was made, and to get a clear day's start of us. What a  consummate rogue! And to do me twice running!\"    \"How did he get at my jewel-case, though?\" Amelia exclaimed.    \"That's the question,\" Charles answered. \"You _do_ leave it about so!\"    \"And why didn't he steal the whole riviere at once, and sell the  gems?\" I inquired.    \"Too cunning,\" Charles replied. \"This was much better business. It  isn't easy to dispose of a big thing like that. In the first place,  the stones are large and valuable; in the second place, they're  well known--every dealer has heard of the Vandrift riviere, and seen  pictures of the shape of them. They're marked gems, so to speak. No,  he played a better game--took a couple of them off, and offered them  to the only one person on earth who was likely to buy them without  suspicion. He came here, meaning to work this very trick; he had  the links made right to the shape beforehand, and then he stole the  stones and slipped them into their places. It's a wonderfully clever  trick. Upon my soul, I almost admire the fellow.\"    For Charles is a business man himself, and can appreciate business  capacity in others.    How Colonel Clay came to know about that necklet, and to appropriate  two of the stones, we only discovered much later. I will not here  anticipate that disclosure. One thing at a time is a good rule in  life. For the moment he succeeded in baffling us altogether.    However, we followed him on to Paris, telegraphing beforehand to the  Bank of France to stop the notes. It was all in vain. They had been  cashed within half an hour of my paying them. The curate and his  wife, we found, quitted the Hotel des Deux Mondes for parts unknown  that same afternoon. And, as usual with Colonel Clay, they vanished  into space, leaving no clue behind them. In other words, they  changed their disguise, no doubt, and reappeared somewhere else that  night in altered characters. At any rate, no such person as the  Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon was ever afterwards heard of--and,  for the matter of that, no such village exists as Empingham,  Northumberland.    We communicated the matter to the Parisian police. They were _most_  unsympathetic. \"It is no doubt Colonel Clay,\" said the official  whom we saw; \"but you seem to have little just ground of complaint  against him. As far as I can see, messieurs, there is not much to  choose between you. You, Monsieur le Chevalier, desired to buy  diamonds at the price of paste. You, madame, feared you had bought  paste at the price of diamonds. You, monsieur the secretary, tried  to get the stones from an unsuspecting person for half their value.  He took you all in, that brave Colonel Caoutchouc--it was diamond  cut diamond.\"    Which was true, no doubt, but by no means consoling.    We returned to the Grand Hotel. Charles was fuming with indignation.  \"This is really too much,\" he exclaimed. \"What an audacious rascal!  But he will never again take me in, my dear Sey. I only hope he'll  try it on. I should love to catch him. I'd know him another time,  I'm sure, in spite of his disguises. It's absurd my being tricked  twice running like this. But never again while I live! Never again,  I declare to you!\"    \"Jamais de la vie!\" a courier in the hall close by murmured  responsive. We stood under the verandah of the Grand Hotel, in the  big glass courtyard. And I verily believe that courier was really  Colonel Clay himself in one of his disguises.    But perhaps we were beginning to suspect him everywhere.          III    THE EPISODE OF THE OLD MASTER      Like most South Africans, Sir Charles Vandrift is anything but  sedentary. He hates sitting down. He must always \"trek.\" He cannot  live without moving about freely. Six weeks in Mayfair at a time is  as much as he can stand. Then he must run away incontinently for  rest and change to Scotland, Homburg, Monte Carlo, Biarritz. \"I  won't be a limpet on the rock,\" he says. Thus it came to pass that  in the early autumn we found ourselves stopping at the Metropole  at Brighton. We were the accustomed nice little family party--Sir  Charles and Amelia, myself and Isabel, with the suite as usual.    On the first Sunday morning after our arrival we strolled out,  Charles and I--I regret to say during the hours allotted for Divine  service--on to the King's Road, to get a whiff of fresh air, and a  glimpse of the waves that were churning the Channel. The two ladies  (with their bonnets) had gone to church; but Sir Charles had risen  late, fatigued from the week's toil, while I myself was suffering  from a matutinal headache, which I attributed to the close air in  the billiard-room overnight, combined, perhaps, with the insidious  effect of a brand of soda-water to which I was little accustomed; I  had used it to dilute my evening whisky. We were to meet our wives  afterwards at the church parade--an institution to which I believe  both Amelia and Isabel attach even greater importance than to the  sermon which precedes it.    We sat down on a glass seat. Charles gazed inquiringly up and down  the King's Road, on the look-out for a boy with Sunday papers.  At last one passed. \"Observer,\" my brother-in-law called out  laconically.    \"Ain't got none,\" the boy answered, brandishing his bundle in our  faces. \"'Ave a Referee or a Pink 'Un?\"    Charles, however, is not a Refereader, while as to the Pink 'Un, he  considers it unsuitable for public perusal on Sunday morning. It may  be read indoors, but in the open air its blush betrays it. So he  shook his head, and muttered, \"If you pass an Observer, send him on  here at once to me.\"    A polite stranger who sat close to us turned round with a pleasant  smile. \"Would you allow me to offer you one?\" he said, drawing a  copy from his pocket. \"I fancy I bought the last. There's a run  on them to-day, you see. Important news this morning from the  Transvaal.\"    Charles raised his eyebrows, and accepted it, as I thought, just a  trifle grumpily. So, to remove the false impression his surliness  might produce on so benevolent a mind, I entered into conversation  with the polite stranger. He was a man of middle age, and medium  height, with a cultivated air, and a pair of gold pince-nez; his"]]]
