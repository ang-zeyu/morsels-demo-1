Since then we have seen demonstrated the  strength of the inflationary pressures which we have to face.    Retail sales in the closing months of 1945 ran 12 percent above the  previous peak for that season, which came in 1944. Prices throughout the  entire economy have been pressing hard against the price ceilings. The  prices of real estate, which cannot now be controlled under the law, are  rising rapidly. Commercial rents are not included in the present price  control law and, where they are not controlled by State law, have been  increasing, causing difficulties to many businessmen.    It will be impossible to maintain a high purchasing power or an expanding  production unless we can keep prices at levels which can be met by the vast  majority of our people. Full production is the greatest weapon against  inflation, but until we can produce enough goods to meet the threat of  inflation the Government will have to exercise its wartime control over  prices.    I am sure that the people of the United States are disturbed by the demands  made by several business groups with regard to price and rent control.    I am particularly disturbed at the effect such thinking may have on  production and employment. If manufacturers continue to hold back goods and  decline to submit bids when invited--as I am informed some are doing--in  anticipation of higher prices which would follow the end of price controls,  we shall inevitably slow down production and create needless unemployment.  On the other hand, there are the vast majority of American businessmen who  are not holding back goods, but who need certainty about the Government  pricing policy in order to fix their own long-range pricing policies.    Businessmen are entitled therefore to a dear statement of the policy of the  Government on the subject. Tenants and housewives, farmers and  workers--consumers in general--have an equal right.    We are all anxious to eliminate unnecessary controls just as rapidly as we  can do so. The steps that we have already taken in many directions toward  that end are a clear indication of our policy.    The present Price Control Act expires on June 30, 1946. If we expect to  maintain a steady economy we shall have to maintain price and rent control  for many months to come. The inflationary pressures on prices and rents,  with relatively few exceptions, are now at an all-time peak. Unless the  Price Control Act is renewed there will be no limit to which our price  levels would soar. Our country would face a national disaster.    We cannot wait to renew the act until immediately before it expires.  Inflation results from psychological as well as economic conditions. The  country has a clear right to know where the Congress stands on this  all-important problem. Any uncertainty now as to whether the act will be  extended gives rise to price speculation, to withholding of goods from the  market in anticipation of rising prices, and to delays in achieving maximum  production.    I do not doubt that the Congress will be beset by many groups who will urge  that the legislation that I have proposed should either be eliminated or  modified to the point where it is nearly useless. The Congress has a clear  responsibility to meet this challenge with courage and determination. I  have every confidence that it will do so.    I strongly urge that the Congress now resolve all doubts and as soon as  possible adopt legislation continuing rent and price control in effect for  a full year from June 30, 1946.    (b) Food subsidies.    If the price line is to be held, if our people are to be protected against  the inflationary dangers which confront us, we must do more than extend the  Price Control Act. In September we were hopeful that the inflationary  pressures would by this time have begun to diminish. We were particularly  hopeful on food. Indeed, it was estimated that food prices at retail would  drop from 3 to 5 percent in the first six months following the end of the  war.    In anticipation of this decline in food prices, it was our belief that food  subsidies could be removed gradually during the winter and spring months,  and eliminated almost completely by June 30 of this year. It was our  feeling that the food subsidies could be dropped without an increase to the  consumer in the present level of food prices or in the over-all cost of  living.    As matters stand today, however, food prices are pressing hard against the  ceilings. The expected decline in food prices has not occurred, nor is it  likely to occur for many months to come. This brings me to the reluctant  conclusion that food subsidies must be continued beyond June 30, 1946.    If we fail to take this necessary step, meat prices on July 1 will be from  3 to 5 cents higher than their average present levels; butter will be at  least 12 cents a pound higher, in addition to the 5 cents a pound increase  of last fall; milk will increase from 1 to 2 cents a quart; bread will  increase about 1 cent a loaf; sugar will increase over 1 cent a pound;  cheese, in addition to the increase of 4 cents now planned for the latter  part of this month, will go up an additional 8 cents. In terms of  percentages we may find the cost-of-living index for food increased by more  than 8 percent, which in turn would result in more than a 3-percent  increase in the cost of living.    If prices of food were allowed to increase by these amounts, I must make it  clear to the Congress that, in my opinion, it would become extremely  difficult for us to control the forces of inflation.    None of us likes subsidies. Our farmers, in particular, have always been  opposed to them.    But I believe our farmers are as deeply conscious as any group in the land  of the havoc which inflation can create. Certainly in the past eighteen  months there has been no group which has fought any harder in support of  the Government's price control program. I am confident that, if the facts  are placed before them and if they see clearly the evils between which we  are forced to choose, they will understand the reasons why subsidies must  be continued.    The legislation continuing the use of food subsidies into the new fiscal  year should be tied down specifically to certain standards. A very proper  requirement, in my opinion, would be that subsidies be removed as soon as  it is indicated that the cost of living will decline below the present  levels.    (c) Extension of War Powers Act.    The Second War Powers Act has recently been extended by the Congress for  six months instead of for a year. It will now expire, unless further  extended, on June 30, 1946. This act is the basis for priority and  inventory controls governing the use of scarce materials, as well as for  other powers essential to orderly reconversion.    I think that this Administration has given adequate proof of the fact that  it desires to eliminate wartime controls as quickly and as expeditiously as  possible. However, we know that there will continue to be shortages of  certain materials caused by the war even after June 30, 1946. It is  important that businessmen know now that materials in short supply are  going to be controlled and distributed fairly as long as these war-born  shortages continue.    I, therefore, urge the Congress soon to extend the Second War Powers Act.  We cannot afford to wait until just before the act expires next June. To  wait would cause the controls to break down in a short time, and would  hamper our production and employment program.    (d) Small business and competition.    A rising birth rate for small business, and a favorable environment for its  growth, are not only economic necessities but also important practical  demonstrations of opportunity in a democratic free society. A great many  veterans and workers with new skills and experience will want to start in  for themselves. The opportunity must be afforded them to do so. They are  the small businessmen of the future.    Actually when we talk about small business we are talking about almost all  of the Nation's individual businesses. Nine out of every ten concerns fall  into this category, and 45 percent of all workers are employed by them.  Between 30 and 40 percent of the total value of all business transactions  are handled by small business.    It is obvious national policy to foster the sound development of small  business. It helps to maintain high levels of employment and national  income and consumption of the goods and services that the Nation can  produce. It encourages the competition that keeps our free enterprise  economy vigorous and expanding. Small business, because of its flexibility,  assists in the rapid exploitation of scientific and technological  discoveries. Investment in small business can absorb a large volume of  savings that might otherwise not be tapped.    The Government should encourage and is encouraging small-business  initiative and originality to stimulate progress through competition.    During the war, the Smaller War Plants Corporation assisted small concerns  to make a maximum contribution to victory. The work of the Smaller War  Plants Corporation is being carried on in peacetime by the Federal Loan  Agency and the Department of Commerce. The fundamental approach to the job  of encouraging small concerns must be based on:    1. Arrangements for making private and public financial resources available  on reasonable terms.    2. Provision of technical advice and assistance to business as a whole on  production, research, and management problems. This will help equalize  competitive relationships between large and small companies, for many of  the small companies cannot afford expensive technical research, accounting,  and tax advice.    3. Elimination of trade practices and agreements which reduce competition  and discriminate against new or small enterprises.

He finally said, \"I  can produce a living woman who will testify that Joseph Smith was a  polygamist, and she knew it.\" I said, \"Bring her along here and let  us examine her.\" Well, I met \"Aunt Lucy\" Walker Kimball, to whom you  refer, and we talked the matter over, and here is the one point to  which I want to draw your attention, to show how these poor dupes of  Brigham Young may be led. Coming to the testimony of Emma Smith, I  said, \"You were personally acquainted with Emma Smith?\" \"Yes.\" \"What  have you to say as to her integrity, as to her fidelity and honor?\" The  old woman looked me fair in the face and said, \"Emma Smith was one of  God's noble women--she was truth personified; and anything that Emma  Smith may say you can bank on it until the day of your death.\" \"Well,\"  I said, \"she testifies that her husband never had any wife but her; she  testifies that she never heard of that revelation on polygamy until you  folks had gone to Salt Lake; she testifies she never saw it, and she  testifies that it is an unmitigated falsehood manufactured by Brigham  Young; that he stated that she had the revelation and burned it. Now  what have you to say to that?\" I said. She looked me fair in the face  and said, \"You can afford to build on anything that Emma Smith has to  say.\" \"Thank you,\" said I.    It is true that she told me she was married to Joseph Smith May 1,  1843; but when I showed her that the so-called revelation permitting a  plurality of wives was dated July 12, 1843, and referred to her former  testimony as given in the _Historical Record_, and that given under  oath in the Temple Lot suit, she was confounded. I felt sorry for the  old lady as she sat silent and confounded.    It is true that I saw a very old lady in your father's parlor, as  she came slowly in for prayers. Your father said, \"This is Catherine  Phillips Smith. She was married to my father, Hyrum Smith, and she has  never married since. I am not sure that the old lady heard a word. It  is certain that _she did not testify to me_, but it was your father who  made the statement, and at once called us to prayer, thus preventing me  from speaking to the old lady.    Lorenzo Snow did testify to me, as stated; but then and there, in  the presence of Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon, I showed _his  testimony to be false, by his own evidence_, when given _under oath_,  and _by his sister's statement signed in 1842_. At this, Snow, Cannon  and Smith were all much annoyed. So much for your father's statement,  which says \"you did not say one word to him in relation to polygamy.\"      YOUR FATHER'S FIRST WIFE    You seem to feel sore over the statement that your father's \"first wife  died broken hearted and insane\"; and you add, \"If you mean to insinuate  that this condition, if true, was the result of any act whatever on  the part of my father, it is also slanderously false.\" I insinuate  nothing; let the public judge the facts. Your father's first wife was  his cousin; she refused to consent to additional wives, and when he  persisted in marrying the Lambson sisters, she obtained a divorce in  California. Julina and Edna Lambson were sisters and were married to  Joseph F. Smith on the same day.[8]    Number of wives married to Joseph F. Smith since 1865: 6    Number of children born to him in 38 years: 42    Number of children born since plural marriage was prohibited in 1890: 13    Children of Julina Lambson Smith: 2    Children of Sarah Richards Smith: 2    Children of Edna Lambson Smith: 2    Children of Alice Kimball Smith: 3    Children of Mary Schwartz Smith: 4    Estimated income available for supporting five establishments: $75,000    Corporations, banks and factories of which Joseph F. Smith is a  director: 20    The only Mormon Apostle who surpasses the record of President  Smith is M. W. Merrill, with 8 wives, 45 children, and 156  grandchildren.--_Collier's_ for March 26, 1894 [1904].    * * * * *    While in Utah I was informed that your father's first wife died broken  hearted and insane. God and civilization know that a woman who loved  her husband from youth up has enough to break her heart and send her  insane when her husband will marry two other women, both sisters, in  one day.    Perhaps you will be assisted to view the matter as I do, should you  read the following in the Book of Mormon, Jacob 2:6, 7. Here it is  stated, in consequence of polygamy, \"ye have broken the hearts of  your tender wives.\" Does this make the prophet an asperser or a  scandalmonger?    I have answered your letter as it appeared in the Toronto _Star_ as  fully as space would permit.                                                   Respectfully,                                                         R. C. Evans.    Toronto, Ontario, March 1, 1905.[9]      Footnotes    1. The teachings of the Latter-day Saints in relation to the doctrine  of the Godhead are clearly set forth in Elder B. H. Roberts' valuable  work, \"Mormon Doctrine of Deity.\" For the belief of the \"Mormon\" people  regarding Adam and his place in the universe, attention is called  especially to chapters one, five and six of that work; also to Doctrine  and Covenants, sec. 78:15-18, sec. 107:53-57 and Daniel 7:9-14. In  relation to this matter I quote the following from the remarks of  President Anthon H. Lund delivered at the General Conference, October  6, 1902.    \"Some there are who follow our Elders, and after they have preached the  principles of salvation, these men get up and charge that the Elders  do not believe in God, but that they believe in Adam as their God,  and they will bring up a few passages from sermons delivered by this  or that man in the Church to substantiate this charge. Now, we are  not ashamed of the glorious doctrine of eternal progression, that man  may attain the position of those to whom came the word of God, that  is gods. When Jesus was preaching unto the Jews on one occasion they  stoned Him, and He wanted to know if they stoned Him for the good works  He had been doing. Oh, no, they say, 'for the good work we stone thee  not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest  thyself God.'\"    He quoted the 33rd to 37th verses of the 10th chapter of the Gospel of  St. John, and said:    \"We believe that there are gods as the Savior quoted. He repeated what  was written in the law, and he did not say that it was wrong, but used  it as an argument against them (The Jews.) While, however, we believe  as the scripture states, that there are more gods, to us there is but  one God. We worship the God that created the heavens and the earth.  We worship the same God that came to our first parents in the Garden  of Eden. In the revelation contained in section 116 of the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants the Lord speaks concerning Adam-ondi-Ahman, 'the  place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the ancient of days  shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the Prophet.' In the 107th section  the Lord speaks of Adam as Michael, the Prince, the Archangel, and  says that he shall be a prince over the nations forever. We may with  perfect propriety call him Prince, the Ancient of Days, or even God in  the meaning of the words of Christ, which I have just quoted. When our  missionaries are met with these sophistries and with isolated extracts  from sermons we say to them anything that is a tenet of our religion  must come through revelation and be sustained by the Church, and they  need not do battle for anything outside of the works, that have been  accepted by the Church as a body.\"    2. If popular custom had designated the true believers of the Bible as  \"Bibles\" as a term of distinction from other worshippers, there is no  reason why a true believer should be offended even at that appellation  but rather honored. Mr. Evans, without doubt, is not ashamed of the  name \"Christian,\" yet this term, like that of \"Mormon\" was first  applied to the followers of Christ in derision, \"because it was  associated in the public mind with the practices\" of the early Saints,  which practices in that day were looked on as \"abominations.\"    3. This is a misquotation, it should be: \"I could refer you to plenty  of instances where men have been righteously slain, in order to atone  for their sins. I have seen scores and hundreds of people for whom  there would have been a chance (in the last resurrection there will be)  if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled on the ground as  a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now angels to the devil,  until our elder brother Jesus Christ raises them up--conquers death,  hell and the grave.\"    In that same discourse President Young declares that those who were  \"righteously slain\" were the wicked that the \"Lord had to slay\" in  ancient Israel. There is not one word in that discourse to indicate  that those who were slain to \"atone for their sins\" were killed in  Utah; but to the contrary they were ancient inhabitants of the earth,  viz., the antediluvians who perished in the flood, the inhabitants  of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Jericho and the cities destroyed by the  Israelites; the prophets of Baal whom Elijah slew (I Kings 18:40) and  a host of others of that class and the class to whom the one belonged  of whom the Savior said: \"It were better for him that a millstone  were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of  the sea.\" President Young's remarks agree with those of Peter when he  declared that the Jews who were guilty of assenting to the crucifixion  of Christ could not be baptized nor have their \"sins blotted out\" until  the \"times of refreshing shall come,\" which was at the time of the  \"restitution of all things.\"--Acts 3:19-21.    4.
