[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#7)"],[1," The difference between the two is that Aunt Agatha conveys  the impression that she considers me personally responsible for all the  sin and sorrow in the world, while Aunt Julia's manner seems to suggest  that I am more to be pitied than censured.    If it wasn't that the thing was a matter of historical fact, I should  be inclined to believe that Aunt Julia had never been on the vaudeville  stage. She is like a stage duchess.    She always seems to me to be in a perpetual state of being about to  desire the butler to instruct the head footman to serve lunch in the  blue-room overlooking the west terrace. She exudes dignity. Yet,  twenty-five years ago, so I've been told by old boys who were lads  about town in those days, she was knocking them cold at the Tivoli in a  double act called 'Fun in a Tea-Shop', in which she wore tights and  sang a song with a chorus that began, 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay'.    There are some things a chappie's mind absolutely refuses to picture,  and Aunt Julia singing 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay' is one of them.    She got straight to the point within five minutes of our meeting.    'What is this about Gussie? Why did you cable for me, Bertie?'    'It's rather a long story,' I said, 'and complicated. If you don't  mind, I'll let you have it in a series of motion pictures. Suppose we  look in at the Auditorium for a few minutes.'    The girl, Ray, had been re-engaged for a second week at the Auditorium,  owing to the big success of her first week. Her act consisted of three  songs. She did herself well in the matter of costume and scenery. She  had a ripping voice. She looked most awfully pretty; and altogether the  act was, broadly speaking, a pippin.    Aunt Julia didn't speak till we were in our seats. Then she gave a sort  of sigh.    'It's twenty-five years since I was in a music-hall!'    She didn't say any more, but sat there with her eyes glued on the  stage.    After about half an hour the johnnies who work the card-index system at  the side of the stage put up the name of Ray Denison, and there was a  good deal of applause.    'Watch this act, Aunt Julia,' I said.    She didn't seem to hear me.    'Twenty-five years! What did you say, Bertie?'    'Watch this act and tell me what you think of it.'    'Who is it? Ray. Oh!'    'Exhibit A,' I said. 'The girl Gussie's engaged to.'    The girl did her act, and the house rose at her. They didn't want to  let her go. She had to come back again and again. When she had finally  disappeared I turned to Aunt Julia.    'Well?' I said.    'I like her work. She's an artist.'    'We will now, if you don't mind, step a goodish way uptown.'    And we took the subway to where Gussie, the human film, was earning his  thirty-five per. As luck would have it, we hadn't been in the place ten  minutes when out he came.    'Exhibit B,' I said. 'Gussie.'    I don't quite know what I had expected her to do, but I certainly  didn't expect her to sit there without a word. She did not move a  muscle, but just stared at Gussie as he drooled on about the moon. I  was sorry for the woman, for it must have been a shock to her to see  her only son in a mauve frockcoat and a brown top-hat, but I thought it  best to let her get a strangle-hold on the intricacies of the situation  as quickly as possible. If I had tried to explain the affair without  the aid of illustrations I should have talked all day and left her  muddled up as to who was going to marry whom, and why.    I was astonished at the improvement in dear old Gussie. He had got back  his voice and was putting the stuff over well. It reminded me of the  night at Oxford when, then but a lad of eighteen, he sang 'Let's All Go  Down the Strand' after a bump supper, standing the while up to his  knees in the college fountain. He was putting just the same zip into  the thing now.    When he had gone off Aunt Julia sat perfectly still for a long time,  and then she turned to me. Her eyes shone queerly.    'What does this mean, Bertie?'    She spoke quite quietly, but her voice shook a bit.    'Gussie went into the business,' I said, 'because the girl's father  wouldn't let him marry her unless he did. If you feel up to it perhaps  you wouldn't mind tottering round to One Hundred and Thirty-third  Street and having a chat with him. He's an old boy with eyebrows, and  he's Exhibit C on my list. When I've put you in touch with him I rather  fancy my share of the business is concluded, and it's up to you.'    The Danbys lived in one of those big apartments uptown which look as if  they cost the earth and really cost about half as much as a hall-room  down in the forties. We were shown into the sitting-room, and presently  old Danby came in.    'Good afternoon, Mr Danby,' I began.    I had got as far as that when there was a kind of gasping cry at my  elbow.    'Joe!' cried Aunt Julia, and staggered against the sofa.    For a moment old Danby stared at her, and then his mouth fell open and  his eyebrows shot up like rockets.    'Julie!'    And then they had got hold of each other's hands and were shaking them  till I wondered their arms didn't come unscrewed.    I'm not equal to this sort of thing at such short notice. The  change in Aunt Julia made me feel quite dizzy. She had shed her  _grande-dame_ manner completely, and was blushing and smiling. I  don't like to say such things of any aunt of mine, or I would go  further and put it on record that she was giggling. And old Danby, who  usually looked like a cross between a Roman emperor and Napoleon  Bonaparte in a bad temper, was behaving like a small boy.    'Joe!'    'Julie!'    'Dear old Joe! Fancy meeting you again!'    'Wherever have you come from, Julie?'    Well, I didn't know what it was all about, but I felt a bit out of it.  I butted in:    'Aunt Julia wants to have a talk with you, Mr Danby.'    'I knew you in a second, Joe!'    'It's twenty-five years since I saw you, kid, and you don't look a day  older.'    'Oh, Joe! I'm an old woman!'    'What are you doing over here? I suppose'--old Danby's cheerfulness  waned a trifle--'I suppose your husband is with you?'    'My husband died a long, long while ago, Joe.'    Old Danby shook his head.    'You never ought to have married out of the profession, Julie. I'm  not saying a word against the late--I can't remember his name; never  could--but you shouldn't have done it, an artist like you. Shall I ever  forget the way you used to knock them with \"Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay\"?'    'Ah! how wonderful you were in that act, Joe.' Aunt Julia sighed. 'Do  you remember the back-fall you used to do down the steps? I always have  said that you did the best back-fall in the profession.'    'I couldn't do it now!'    'Do you remember how we put it across at the Canterbury, Joe? Think of  it! The Canterbury's a moving-picture house now, and the old Mogul runs  French revues.'    'I'm glad I'm not there to see them.'    'Joe, tell me, why did you leave England?'    'Well, I--I wanted a change. No I'll tell you the truth, kid. I wanted  you, Julie. You went off and married that--whatever that stage-door  johnny's name was--and it broke me all up.'    Aunt Julia was staring at him. She is what they call a well-preserved  woman. It's easy to see that, twenty-five years ago, she must have been  something quite extraordinary to look at. Even now she's almost  beautiful. She has very large brown eyes, a mass of soft grey hair, and  the complexion of a girl of seventeen.    'Joe, you aren't going to tell me you were fond of me yourself!'    'Of course I was fond of you. Why did I let you have all the fat in  \"Fun in a Tea-Shop\"? Why did I hang about upstage while you sang  \"Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay\"? Do you remember my giving you a bag of buns  when we were on the road at Bristol?'    'Yes, but--'    'Do you remember my giving you the ham sandwiches at Portsmouth?'    'Joe!'    'Do you remember my giving you a seed-cake at Birmingham? What did you  think all that meant, if not that I loved you? Why, I was working up by  degrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly went off and  married that cane-sucking dude. That's why I wouldn't let my daughter  marry this young chap, Wilson, unless he went into the profession.  She's an artist--'    'She certainly is, Joe.'    'You've seen her? Where?'    'At the Auditorium just now. But, Joe, you mustn't stand in the way of  her marrying the man she's in love with. He's an artist, too.'    'In the small time.'    'You were in the small time once, Joe. You mustn't look down on him  because he's a beginner. I know you feel that your daughter is marrying  beneath her, but--'    'How on earth do you know anything about young Wilson?    'He's my son.'    'Your son?'    'Yes, Joe. And I've just been watching him work. Oh, Joe, you can't  think how proud I was of him! He's got it in him. It's fate. He's my  son and he's in the profession! Joe, you don't know what I've been  through for his sake. They made a lady of me. I never worked so hard in  my life as I did to become a real lady. They kept telling me I had got  to put it across, no matter what it cost, so that he wouldn't be  ashamed of me. The study was something terrible. I had to watch myself  every minute for years, and I never knew when I might fluff my lines or  fall down on some bit of business. But I did it, because I didn't want  him to be ashamed of me, though all the time I was just aching to be  back where I belonged.'    Old Danby made a jump at her, and took her by the shoulders.    'Come back where you belong, Julie!' he cried. 'Your husband's dead,  your son's a pro. Come back! It's twenty-five years ago, but I haven't  changed. I want you still. I've always wanted you. You've got to come  back, kid, where you belong.'    Aunt Julia gave a sort of gulp and looked at him.    'Joe!' she said in a kind of whisper.    'You're here, kid,' said Old Danby, huskily.

And disconsolate went  away those dukes and princes, and troubadours in disguise. Yet  Ackronnion pondered as he went away.    King he was of Afarmah, Lool and Haf, over-lord of Zeroora and hilly  Chang, and duke of the dukedoms of Molong and Mlash, none of them  unfamiliar with romance or unknown or overlooked in the making of  myth. He pondered as he went in his thin disguise.    Now by those that do not remember their childhood, having other things  to do, be it understood that underneath fairyland, which is, as all  men know, at the edge of the world, there dwelleth the Gladsome Beast.  A synonym he for joy.    It is known how the lark in its zenith, children at play out-of-doors,  good witches and jolly old parents have all been compared--how  aptly!--with this very same Gladsome Beast. Only one \"crab\" he has (if  I may use slang for a moment to make myself perfectly clear), only one  drawback, and that is that in the gladness of his heart he spoils the  cabbages of the Old Man Who Looks After Fairyland,--and of course he  eats men.    It must further be understood that whoever may obtain the tears of the  Gladsome Beast in a bowl, and become drunken upon them, may move all  persons to shed tears of joy so long as he remains inspired by the  potion to sing or to make music.    Now Ackronnion pondered in this wise: that if he could obtain the  tears of the Gladsome Beast by means of his art, withholding him from  violence by the spell of music, and if a friend should slay the  Gladsome Beast before his weeping ceased--for an end must come to  weeping even with men--that so he might get safe away with the tears,  and drink them before the Queen of the Woods and move her to tears of  joy. He sought out therefore a humble knightly man who cared not for  the beauty of Sylvia, Queen of the Woods, but had found a woodland  maiden of his own once long ago in summer. And the man's name was  Arrath, a subject of Ackronnion, a knight-at-arms of the spear-guard:  and together they set out through the fields of fable until they came  to Fairyland, a kingdom sunning itself (as all men know) for leagues  along the edges of the world. And by a strange old pathway they came  to the land they sought, through a wind blowing up the pathway sheer  from space with a kind of metallic taste from the roving stars. Even  so they came to the windy house of thatch where dwells the Old Man Who  Looks After Fairyland sitting by parlour windows that look away from  the world. He made them welcome in his star-ward parlour, telling them  tales of Space, and when they named to him their perilous quest he  said it would be a charity to kill the Gladsome Beast; for he was  clearly one of those that liked not its happy ways. And then he took  them out through his back door, for the front door had no pathway nor  even a step--from it the old man used to empty his slops sheer on to  the Southern Cross--and so they came to the garden wherein his  cabbages were, and those flowers that only blow in Fairyland, turning  their faces always towards the comet, and he pointed them out the way  to the place he called Underneath, where the Gladsome Beast had his  lair. Then they manoeuvred. Ackronnion was to go by the way of the  steps with his harp and an agate bowl, while Arrath went round by a  crag on the other side. Then the Old Man Who Looks After Fairyland  went back to his windy house, muttering angrily as he passed his  cabbages, for he did not love the ways of the Gladsome Beast; and the  two friends parted on their separate ways.    Nothing perceived them but that ominous crow glutted overlong already  upon the flesh of man.    The wind blew bleak from the stars.    At first there was dangerous climbing, and then Ackronnion gained the  smooth, broad steps that led from the edge to the lair, and at that  moment heard at the top of the steps the continuous chuckles of the  Gladsome Beast.    He feared then that its mirth might be insuperable, not to be saddened  by the most grievous song; nevertheless he did not turn back then, but  softly climbed the stairs and, placing the agate bowl upon a step,  struck up the chaunt called Dolorous. It told of desolate, regretted  things befallen happy cities long since in the prime of the world. It  told of how the gods and beasts and men had long ago loved beautiful  companions, and long ago in vain. It told of the golden host of happy  hopes, but not of their achieving. It told how Love scorned Death, but  told of Death's laughter. The contented chuckles of the Gladsome Beast  suddenly ceased in his lair. He rose and shook himself. He was still  unhappy. Ackronnion still sang on the chaunt called Dolorous. The  Gladsome Beast came mournfully up to him. Ackronnion ceased not for  the sake of his panic, but still sang on. He sang of the malignity of  time. Two tears welled large in the eyes of the Gladsome Beast.  Ackronnion moved the agate bowl to a suitable spot with his foot. He  sang of autumn and of passing away. Then the beast wept as the frore  hills weep in the thaw, and the tears splashed big into the agate  bowl. Ackronnion desperately chaunted on; he told of the glad  unnoticed things men see and do not see again, of sunlight beheld  unheeded on faces now withered away. The bowl was full. Ackronnion was  desperate: the Beast was so close. Once he thought that its mouth was  watering!--but it was only the tears that had run on the lips of the  Beast. He felt as a morsel! The Beast was ceasing to weep! He sang of  worlds that had disappointed the gods. And all of a sudden, crash! and  the staunch spear of Arrath went home behind the shoulder, and the  tears and the joyful ways of the Gladsome Beast were ended and over  for ever.    And carefully they carried the bowl of tears away, leaving the body of  the Gladsome Beast as a change of diet for the ominous crow; and going  by the windy house of thatch they said farewell to the Old Man Who  Looks After Fairyland, who when he heard of the deed rubbed his hands  together and mumbled again and again, \"And a very good thing, too. My  cabbages! My cabbages!\"    And not long after Ackronnion sang again in the sylvan palace of the  Queen of the Woods, having first drunk all the tears in his agate  bowl. And it was a gala night, and all the court were there and  ambassadors from the lands of legend and myth, and even some from  Terra Cognita.    And Ackronnion sang as he never sang before, and will not sing again.  O, but dolorous, dolorous, are all the ways of man, few and fierce are  his days, and the end trouble, and vain, vain his endeavour: and  woman--who shall tell of it?--her doom is written with man's by  listless, careless gods with their faces to other spheres.    Somewhat thus he began, and then inspiration seized him, and all the  trouble in the beauty of his song may not be set down by me: there was  much of gladness in it, and all mingled with grief: it was like the  way of man: it was like our destiny.    Sobs arose at his song, sighs came back along echoes: seneschals,  soldiers, sobbed, and a clear cry made the maidens; like rain the  tears came down from gallery to gallery.    All round the Queen of the Woods was a storm of sobbing and sorrow.    But no, she would not weep.        THE HOARD OF THE GIBBELINS      The Gibbelins eat, as is well known, nothing less good than man. Their  evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a  bridge. Their hoard is beyond reason; avarice has no use for it; they  have a separate cellar for emeralds and a separate cellar for  sapphires; they have filled a hole with gold and dig it up when they  need it. And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is  to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of  famine they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little  trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough their larders would  soon be full again.    Their tower stands on the other side of that river known to Homer--_ho  rhoos okeanoio_, as he called it--which surrounds the world. And where  the river is narrow and fordable the tower was built by the Gibbelins'  gluttonous sires, for they liked to see burglars rowing easily to  their steps. Some nourishment that common soil has not the huge trees  drained there with their colossal roots from both banks of the river.    There the Gibbelins lived and discreditably fed.    Alderic, Knight of the Order of the City and the Assault, hereditary  Guardian of the King's Peace of Mind, a man not unremembered among  makers of myth, pondered so long upon the Gibbelins' hoard that by now  he deemed it his. Alas that I should say of so perilous a venture,  undertaken at dead of night by a valorous man, that its motive was  sheer avarice! Yet upon avarice only the Gibbelins relied to keep their  larders full, and once in every hundred years sent spies into the cities  of men to see how avarice did, and always the spies returned again to  the tower saying that all was well.    It may be thought that, as the years went on and men came by fearful  ends on that tower's wall, fewer and fewer would come to the  Gibbelins' table: but the Gibbelins found otherwise.    Not in the folly and frivolity of his youth did Alderic come to the  tower, but he studied carefully for several years the manner in which  burglars met their doom when they went in search of the treasure that  he considered his. _In every case they had entered by the door_.    He consulted those who gave advice on this quest; he noted every  detail and cheerfully paid their fees, and determined to do nothing  that they advised, for what were their clients now? No more than  examples of the savoury art, and mere half-forgotten memories of a  meal; and many, perhaps,"]]]
