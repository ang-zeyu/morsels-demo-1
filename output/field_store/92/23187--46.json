The town  failing to make the purchase, I at once accepted these terms, and Rosa  Bonheur then placed the picture at my disposal. I tendered her the  40,000 francs and she said: 'I am much gratified at your giving me  such a noble price, but I do not like to feel that I have taken  advantage of your liberality; let us see how we can combine in the  matter. You will not be able to have an engraving made from so large a  canvas. Suppose I paint you a small one from the same subject, of  which I will make you a present.' Of course I accepted the gift, and  thus it happened that the large work went travelling over the kingdom  on exhibition, while Thomas Landseer was making an engraving from the  quarter-size replica.    \"After some time (in 1857 I think), I sold the original picture to  Mr. William P. Wright, New York (whose picture gallery and residence  were at Weehawken, N.J.), for the sum of 30,000 francs, but later I  understood that Mr. Stewart paid a much larger price for it on the  breaking up of Mr. Wright's gallery. The quarter size replica, from  which the engraving was made, I finally sold to Mr. Jacob Bell, who  gave it in 1859 to the nation, and it is now in the National Gallery,  London. A second, still smaller replica, was painted a few years  later, and was resold some time ago in London for L4,000  ($20,000). There is also a smaller water-colour drawing which was sold  to Mr. Bolckow for 2,500 guineas ($12,000), and is now an heirloom  belonging to the town of Middlesbrough. That is the whole history of  this grand work. The Stewart canvas is the real and true original, and  only large size 'Horse-Fair.'    \"Once in Mr. Stewart's collection, it never left his gallery until the  auction sale of his collection, March 25th, 1887, when it was  purchased by Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt for the sum of $55,000, and  presented to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\"    And thus we have the whole story of the \"Horse-Fair.\" The picture is  93-1/2 inches high, and 197 inches wide, and it contains a great  number of horses, some of which are ridden, while others are led, and  all are crowding with wild gaiety toward the fair where it is quite  plain they know they are about to be admired and their beauty shown to  the best advantage. Other well-known Rosa Bonheurs are \"Ploughing,\"  \"Shepherd Guarding Sheep,\" \"Highland Sheep,\" \"Scotch Deer,\" \"American  Mustangs,\" and \"The Study of a Lioness.\"          V    ALESSANDRO BOTTICELLI        (Pronounced Ah-lays-sahn'dro Bo't-te-chel'lee)    _Florentine School,_    1447-1510 (Vasari's dates)    _Pupil of Filippo Lippi and Verrocchio_    Botticelli took his name from his first master, as was the fashion in  those days. The relation of master and apprentice was very close, not  at all like the relation of pupil and teacher to-day.    Botticelli's father was a Florentine citizen, Mariano Filipepi, and he  wished his son to become a goldsmith; hence the lad was soon  apprenticed to Botticelli, the goldsmith. As a scholar, the little  goldsmith had not distinguished himself. Indeed it is said that as a  boy he would not \"take to any sort of schooling in reading, writing,  or arithmetic.\" It cannot be said that this failure distinguished him  as a genius, or the world would be full of genius-boys; but the result  was that he early began to learn his trade.    Fortunately for him and us, Botticelli, the smith, was a man of some  wisdom and when he saw that the lad originated beautiful designs and  had creative genius he did not treat the matter with scorn, as the  master of Andrea del Sarto had done, but sent him instead to Fra  Filippo (Lippo Lippi) to be taught the art of painting. So kind a deed  might well establish a feeling of devotion on little Alessandro's part  and make him wish to take his master's name.    Fra Filippo was a Carmelite monk, merry and kindly; simple, good, and  gifted, but his temperament did not seem to influence his young  pupil. Of all unhappy, morbid men, Botticelli seems to have been the  most so, unless we are to except Michael Angelo.    After studying with the monk, Botticelli was summoned by Pope Sixtus  IV. to Rome to decorate a new chapel in the Vatican. Before that time  his whole life had been greatly influenced by the teachings of  Savonarola who had preached both passionately and learnedly in  Florence, advocating liberty. From the time he fell under Savonarola's  wonderful power, the artist grew more and more mystic and morbid. In  Rome it was the custom to have the portraits of conspirators, or  persons of high degree who were revolutionary or otherwise  objectionable to the state, hung outside the Public Palace, and in  Botticelli's time there was a famous disturbance among the aristocrats  of the state. In 1478 the powerful Pazzi family conspired against the  Medici family, which then actually had control. It was Botticelli who  was engaged to paint the portraits of the Pazzi family, which to their  shame and humiliation were to be displayed upon the palace walls.    One peculiarity of this artist's pictures was that he used actual  goldleaf to make the high lights upon hair, leaves, and draperies. The  effect of the use of this gold was very beautiful, if unusual, and it  may have been that his apprenticeship as a goldsmith suggested to him  such a device.    Also it was he who created certain characteristics of painting that  have since been thought original with Burne-Jones. This was the use of  long stiff lily-stalks or other upright details in his compositions.  Examples of this idea, which produced so weird an effect, will be  found in his allegory of \"Spring,\" where stiff tree-trunks form a part  of the background. In the \"Madonna of the Palms\" upright lily-stalks  are held in pale and trembling hands. Like Michael Angelo, who came  years afterward, Botticelli was a guest of the great Lorenzo the  \"Magnificent,\" in Florence. It was by Botticelli's hand that the  greater painter sent a letter to Lorenzo from a duchess friend who was  also his patron. This was in Angelo's youth; in Botticelli's old age.    All his life was a drama of morbid seeking after the unattainable, and  finally he became so poor and helpless that in his old age he would  have starved had Lorenzo de' Medici not taken care of him. Lorenzo and  other friends who in spite of his gloominess admired his real piety,  gathered about him and kept him from starvation.    On his \"Nativity,\" Botticelli wrote: \"This picture I, Alessandro,  painted at the end of the year 1500 in the troubles of Italy, in the  halftime after the time, during the fulfilment of the eleventh of  John, in the second woe of the Apocalypse, in the loosing the devil  for three and a half years. Afterward he shall be chained according to  the twelfth of John, and see him trodden down as in this picture.\" All  of this is interesting because Botticelli himself wrote it, but it is  not very easily understood by any child, nor by many grown people.    Botticelli did some very extraordinary things, but whether they are  beautiful or not one must decide for himself. They are paintings so  characteristic that one must think them very beautiful or else not at  all so.      PLATE--LA PRIMAVERA    _(Spring)_    In this picture we have the forerunner of a modern painter, because we  see in it certain, qualities that we find in Boecklin. Look at the  effect of vertical lines; the tree trunks, and the poses of the  slender women. Over all hovers a cupid who is sending love-shafts into  the hearts of all in springtime.    Notice the lacy effect of the flowers that bestar the wind-blown gown  of \"La Primavera,\" the fern-like leaves that fleck the background; the  draperies that do not conceal the forms of the nymphs of the lovely  springtime.    The very spirit of spring is seen in all the half-floating,  half-dancing, gliding, diaphanous figures of the forest. The flowers  of \"La Primavera's\" crown are blue and white cornflowers and  primroses. She scatters over the earth tulips, anemones, and  narcissus. The painting is allegorical and unique. Never were such  fluttering odds and ends of draperies painted before, nor such  fascinating effects had from canvas, paint, or brush. The picture  hangs in Florence in the Uffizi Gallery. A German critic tells us that  the \"Realm of Venus,\" is a better title for this picture, and that it  was painted after a poem of that name.    Other pictures by this artist are: \"The Birth of Venus,\" \"Pallas,\"  \"Judith,\" \"Holofernes,\" \"St. Augustine,\" \"Adoration of the Magi,\" and  \"St. Sebastian.\"          VI    WILLIAM ADOLPHE BOUGUEREAU        (Pronounced W. A'dolf Bou-gair-roh)    _French (Genre) School_    1825-1905    _Pupil of Picot and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts_    Bouguereau's business-like father meant his son also to be  business-like, but he made the mistake of permitting him to go to a  drawing school in Bordeaux and there, to his father's chagrin, the  youngster took the annual prize. After that there seemed nothing for  the father to do but grin and bear it, because the son decided to be  an artist and had fairly won his right to be one.    Young Bouguereau had no money, and therefore he went to live with an  uncle at Saintonge, a priest, who had much sympathy with the boy's  wish to paint, and he left him free to do the best he could for  himself in art. He got a chance to paint some portraits, and when he  and his uncle talked the matter over It was decided that he should  take the money got for them, and go to Paris. It was there that he  sought Picot, his first truly helpful teacher; and there, for the  first time he learned more than he already knew about art.    All Bouguereau's opportunities in life were made by himself, by his  own genius. No one gave him anything; he earned all. He longed to go  to Italy, and in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts he won the Prix de Rome,  which made possible a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#7)"],[1,"a tortoise-shell at his ear to expel the evil spirit, bit him  till blood flowed, and then displayed in triumph a small piece of wood,  bone, or iron, which he had hidden in his mouth, and which he affirmed  was the source of the disease, now happily removed. [27] Sometimes he  prescribed a dance, feast, or game; and the whole village bestirred  themselves to fulfil the injunction to the letter. They gambled away  their all; they gorged themselves like vultures; they danced or played  ball naked among the snow-drifts from morning till night. At a medical  feast, some strange or unusual act was commonly enjoined as vital to the  patient's cure: as, for example, the departing guest, in place of the  customary monosyllable of thanks, was required to greet his host with an  ugly grimace. Sometimes, by prescription, half the village would throng  into the house where the patient lay, led by old women disguised with  the heads and skins of bears, and beating with sticks on sheets of dry  bark. Here the assembly danced and whooped for hours together, with a  din to which a civilized patient would promptly have succumbed.  Sometimes the doctor wrought himself into a prophetic fury, raving  through the length and breadth of the dwelling, snatching firebrands and  flinging them about him, to the terror of the squaws, with whom, in  their combustible tenements, fire was a constant bugbear.    [27] The Hurons believed that the chief cause of disease and death was a  monstrous serpent, that lived under the earth. By touching a tuft of  hair, a feather, or a fragment of bone, with a portion of his flesh or  fat, the sorcerer imparted power to it of entering the body of his  victim, and gradually killing him. It was an important part of the  doctor's function to extract these charms from the vitals of his  patient.--Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1648, 75.    Among the Hurons and kindred tribes, disease was frequently ascribed to  some hidden wish ungratified. Hence the patient was overwhelmed with  gifts, in the hope, that, in their multiplicity, the desideratum might  be supplied. Kettles, skins, awls, pipes, wampum, fish-hooks, weapons,  objects of every conceivable variety, were piled before him by a host of  charitable contributors; and if, as often happened, a dream, the Indian  oracle, had revealed to the sick man the secret of his cure, his demands  were never refused, however extravagant, idle, nauseous, or abominable.  [28] Hence it is no matter of wonder that sudden illness and sudden  cures were frequent among the Hurons. The patient reaped profit, and the  doctor both profit and honor.    [28] \"Dans le pays de nos Hurons, il se faict aussi des assemblÃ©es de  toutes les filles d'vn bourg auprÃ©s d'vne malade, tant Ã  sa priere,  suyuant la resuerie ou le songe qu'elle en aura euÃ«, que par  l'ordonnance de Loki (the doctor), pour sa santÃ© et guerison. Les filles  ainsi assemblÃ©es, on leur demande Ã  toutes, les vnes apres les autres,  celuy qu'elles veulent des ieunes hommes du bourg pour dormir auec elles  la nuict prochaine: elles en nomment chacune vn, qui sont aussi-tost  aduertis par les Maistres de la ceremonie, lesquels viennent tous au  soir en la presence de la malade dormir chacun auec celle qui l'a  choysi, d'vn bout Ã  l'autre de la Cabane, et passent ainsi toute la  nuict, pendant que deux Capitaines aux deux bouts du logis chantent et  sonnent de leur TortuÃ« du soir au lendemain matin, que la ceremonie  cesse. Dieu vueille abolir vne si damnable et malheureuse  ceremonie.\"--Sagard, Voyage des Hurons, 158.--This unique mode of cure,  which was called Andacwandet, is also described by Lalemant, who saw it.  (Relation des Hurons, 1639, 84.) It was one of the recognized remedies.    For the medical practices of the Hurons, see also Champlain, BrÃ©beuf,  Lafitau, Charlevoix, and other early writers. Those of the Algonquins  were in some points different. The doctor often consulted the spirits,  to learn the cause and cure of the disease, by a method peculiar to that  family of tribes. He shut himself in a small conical lodge, and the  spirits here visited him, manifesting their presence by a violent  shaking of the whole structure. This superstition will be described in  another connection.      THE HURON-IROQUOIS FAMILY.    And now, before entering upon the very curious subject of Indian social  and tribal organization, it may be well briefly to observe the position  and prominent distinctive features of the various communities speaking  dialects of the generic tongue of the Iroquois. In this remarkable  family of tribes occur the fullest developments of Indian character, and  the most conspicuous examples of Indian intelligence. If the higher  traits popularly ascribed to the race are not to be found here, they are  to be found nowhere. A palpable proof of the superiority of this stock  is afforded in the size of the Iroquois and Huron brains. In average  internal capacity of the cranium, they surpass, with few and doubtful  exceptions, all other aborigines of North and South America, not  excepting the civilized races of Mexico and Peru. [29]    [29] \"On comparing five Iroquois heads, I find that they give an average  internal capacity of eighty-eight cubic inches, which is within two  inches of the Caucasian mean.\"--Morton, Crania Americana, 195.--It is  remarkable that the internal capacity of the skulls of the barbarous  American tribes is greater than that of either the Mexicans or the  Peruvians. \"The difference in volume is chiefly confined to the  occipital and basal portions,\"--in other words, to the region of the  animal propensities; and hence, it is argued, the ferocious, brutal, and  uncivilizable character of the wild tribes.--See J. S. Phillips,  Admeasurements of Crania of the Principal Groups of Indians in the  United States.    In the woody valleys of the Blue Mountains, south of the Nottawassaga  Bay of Lake Huron, and two days' journey west of the frontier Huron  towns, lay the nine villages of the Tobacco Nation, or Tionnontates.  [30] In manners, as in language, they closely resembled the Hurons. Of  old they were their enemies, but were now at peace with them, and about  the year 1640 became their close confederates. Indeed, in the ruin which  befell that hapless people, the Tionnontates alone retained a tribal  organization; and their descendants, with a trifling exception, are to  this day the sole inheritors of the Huron or Wyandot name. Expatriated  and wandering, they held for generations a paramount influence among the  Western tribes. [31] In their original seats among the Blue Mountains,  they offered an example extremely rare among Indians, of a tribe raising  a crop for the market; for they traded in tobacco largely with other  tribes. Their Huron confederates, keen traders, would not suffer them to  pass through their country to traffic with the French, preferring to  secure for themselves the advantage of bartering with them in French  goods at an enormous profit. [32]    [30] Synonymes: Tionnontates, Etionontates, Tuinontatek, Dionondadies,  Khionontaterrhonons, Petuneux or Nation du Petun (Tobacco).  [31] \"L'ame de tous les Conseils.\"--Charlevoix, Voyage, 199.--In 1763  they were Pontiac's best warriors.  [32] On the Tionnontates, see Le Mercier, Relation, 1637, 163; Lalemant,  Relation, 1641, 69; Ragueneau, Relation, 1648, 61. An excellent summary  of their character and history, by Mr. Shea, will be found in Hist.  Mag., V. 262.    Journeying southward five days from the Tionnontate towns, the forest  traveller reached the border villages of the Attiwandarons, or Neutral  Nation. [33] As early as 1626, they were visited by the Franciscan  friar, La Roche Dallion, who reports a numerous population in  twenty-eight towns, besides many small hamlets. Their country, about  forty leagues in extent, embraced wide and fertile districts on the  north shore of Lake Erie, and their frontier extended eastward across  the Niagara, where they had three or four outlying towns. [34] Their  name of Neutrals was due to their neutrality in the war between the  Hurons and the Iroquois proper. The hostile warriors, meeting in a  Neutral cabin, were forced to keep the peace, though, once in the open  air, the truce was at an end. Yet this people were abundantly ferocious,  and, while holding a pacific attitude betwixt their warring kindred,  waged deadly strife with the Mascoutins, an Algonquin horde beyond Lake  Michigan. Indeed, it was but recently that they had been at blows with  seventeen Algonquin tribes. [35] They burned female prisoners, a  practice unknown to the Hurons. [36] Their country was full of game, and  they were bold and active hunters. In form and stature they surpassed  even the Hurons, whom they resembled in their mode of life, and from  whose language their own, though radically similar, was dialectically  distinct. Their licentiousness was even more open and shameless; and  they stood alone in the extravagance of some of their usages. They kept  their dead in their houses till they became insupportable; then scraped  the flesh from the bones, and displayed them in rows along the walls,  there to remain till the periodical Feast of the Dead, or general  burial. In summer, the men wore no clothing whatever, but were usually  tattooed from head to foot with powdered charcoal.
