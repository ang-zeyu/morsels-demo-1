To this, however, the lieutenant, for  various reasons, could not grant his consent; and when they found that  their intercessions were ineffectual, they manifested their compassion  by tears.    On the 1st of May, the observatory was set up, and the astronomical  quadrant, together with some other instruments, was taken on shore.  When, on the next morning, Mr. Cook and Mr. Green landed for the  purpose of fixing the quadrant in a situation for use, to their  inexpressible surprise and concern it was not to be found. It had been  deposited in a tent reserved for the lieutenant's use, where no one  had slept; it had never been taken out of the packing case, and the  whole was of considerable weight: none of the other instruments were  missing; and a sentinel had been posted the whole night within five  yards of the tent. These circumstances induced a suspicion that the  robbery might have been committed by some of our own people, who  having seen a deal box, and not knowing the contents, might imagine  that it contained nails, or other articles for traffic with the  natives. The most diligent search, therefore, was made, and a large  reward was offered for the finding of the quadrant, but with no degree  of success. In this exigency, Mr. Banks was of eminent service. As  this gentleman had more influence over the Indians than any other  person on board the Endeavour, and as there could be little doubt of  the quadrant's having been conveyed away by some of the natives, he  determined to go in search of it into the woods; and it was recovered  in consequence of his judicious and spirited exertions. The pleasure  with which it was brought back was equal to the importance of the  event; for the grand object of the voyage could not otherwise have  been accomplished.    Another embarrassment, though not of so serious a nature, was  occasioned, on the very same day, by one of our officers having  inadvertently taken into custody Tootahah, a chief, who had connected  himself in the most friendly manner with the English. Lieutenant Cook,  who had given express orders that none of the Indians should be  confined, and who, therefore, was equally surprised and concerned at  this transaction; instantly set Tootahah at liberty. So strongly had  this Indian been possessed with the notion that it was intended to put  him to death, that he could not be persuaded to the contrary till he  was led out of the fort. His joy at his deliverance was so great, that  it displayed itself in a liberality which our people were very  unwilling to partake of, from a consciousness that on this occasion  they had no claim to the reception of favours. The impression,  however, of the confinement of the chief operated with such force upon  the minds of the natives, that few of them appeared; and the market  was so ill supplied that the English were in want of necessaries. At  length, by the prudent exertions of Lieutenant Cook, Mr. Banks, and  Dr. Solander, the friendship of Tootahah was completely recovered, and  the reconciliation worked upon the Indians like a charm; for it was no  sooner known that he had gone voluntarily on board the Endeavour, than  bread-fruit, cocoa nuts, and other provisions, were brought to the  fort in great plenty.    The lieutenant and the rest of the gentlemen had hitherto, with a  laudable discretion, bartered only beads for the articles of food now  mentioned. But the market becoming slack, they were obliged for the  first time, on the 8th of May, to bring out their nails; and such was  the effect of this new commodity, that one of the smallest size, which  was about four inches long, procured twenty cocoa nuts, and  bread-fruit in proportion.    It was not till the 10th of the month that our voyagers learned that  the Indian name of the island was OTAHEITE, by which name it hath  since been always distinguished.    On Sunday the 14th, an instance was exhibited of the inattention of  the natives to our modes of religion. The lieutenant had directed,  that divine service should be performed at the fort; and he was  desirous that some of the principal Indians should be present. Mr.  Banks secured the attendance of Tuobourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio,  hoping that it would give occasion to some inquiries on their part,  and to some instruction in return. During the whole service, they very  attentively observed Mr. Banks's behaviour, and stood, sat, or  kneeled, as they saw him do; and they appeared to be sensible, that it  was a serious and important employment in which the English were  engaged. But when the worship was ended, neither of them asked any  questions, nor would they attend to any explanations which were  attempted to be given of what had been performed.    As the day approached for executing the grand purpose of the voyage,  Lieutenant Cook determined, in consequence of some hints which he had  received from the Earl of Morton, to send out two parties, to observe  the transit of Venus from other situations. By this means he hoped,  that the success of the observation would be secured, if there should  happen to be any failure at Otaheite. Accordingly, on Thursday the 1st  of June, he dispatched Mr. Gore in the long boat to Eimeo, a  neighbouring island, together with Mr. Monkhouse and Mr. Sporing, a  gentleman belonging to Mr. Banks. They were furnished by Mr. Green  with proper instruments. Mr. Banks himself chose to go upon this  expedition, in which he was accompanied by Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio,  and by others of the natives. Early the next morning, the lieutenant  sent Mr. Hicks, in the pinnace, with Mr. Clerk and Mr. Pickersgill,  and Mr. Saunders, one of the midshipmen, ordering them to fix upon  some convenient spot to the eastward, at a distance from the principal  observatory, where they also might employ the instruments they were  provided with for observing the transit.    The anxiety for such weather as would be favourable to the success of  the experiment, was powerfully felt by all the parties concerned. They  could not sleep in peace the preceding night: but their apprehensions  were happily removed by the sun's rising, on the morning of the 3d of  June, without a cloud. The weather continued with equal clearness  through the whole of the day; so that the observation was successively  made in every quarter. At the fort where Lieutenant Cook, Mr. Green,  and Dr. Solander were stationed, the whole passage of the planet Venus  over the sun's disk was observed with great advantage. The magnifying  power of Dr. Solander's telescope was superior to that of those which  belonged to the lieutenant and to Mr. Green. They all saw an  atmosphere or dusky cloud round the body of the planet; which much  disturbed the times of the contact, and especially of the internal  ones; and, in their accounts of these times, they differed from each  other in a greater degree than might have been expected. According to  Mr. Green,                                   _Morning._    The first external contact, or first appearance     h. min. sec.     of Venus on the sun, was . . . . . . . . . . .     9   25   42    The first internal contact, or total immersion,     was . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . .      9   44    4                                     _Afternoon._    The second internal contact, or beginning     of the emersion, was . . . . . . . . . . . . .     3   14    8    The second external contact, or total     emersion, was . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      3   32   10    The latitude of the observatory was found to be     17 deg. 29' 15\"; and the longitude 149 deg. 32' 30\" west     of Greenwich.    A more particular account of this great astronomical event, the  providing for the accurate observation of which reflects so much  honour on his majesty's munificent patronage of science, may be seen  in the sixty-first volume of the Philosophical Transactions.    The pleasure which Lieutenant Cook and his friends derived, from  having thus successfully accomplished the first grand object of the  voyage, was not a little abated by the conduct of some of the ship's  company, who, while the attention of the officers was engrossed by the  transit of Venus, broke into one of the store-rooms, and stole a  quantity of spike nails, amounting to no less than a hundred weight.  This was an evil of a public and serious nature; for these nails, if  injudiciously circulated among the Indians, would be productive of  irreparable injury to the English, by reducing the value of iron,  their staple commodity. One of the thieves, from whom only seven nails  were recovered, was detected; but though the punishment of two dozen  lashes was inflicted upon him, he would not impeach any of his  accomplices.    Upon account of the absence of the two parties who had been sent out  to observe the transit, the king's birthday was celebrated on the 5th,  instead of the 4th of June; and the festivity of the day must have  been greatly heightened by the happy success with which his majesty's  liberality had been crowned.    On the 12th, Lieutenant Cook was again reduced to the necessity of  exercising the severity of discipline. Complaint having been made to  him, by certain of the natives, that two of the seamen had taken from  them several bows and arrows, and some strings of platted hair, and  the charge being fully supported, he punished each of the criminals  with two dozen of lashes.    On the same day it was discovered, that Otaheite, like other countries  in a certain period of society, has its bards and its minstrels. Mr.  Banks, in his morning's walk, had met with a number of natives, who  appeared, upon inquiry, to be travelling musicians; and, having,  learned where they were to be at night, all the gentlemen of the  Endeavour repaired to the place. The band consisted of two flutes and  three drums; and the drummers accompanied the music with their voices.  To the surprise of the English gentlemen, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#7)"],[1,"sentence. For the first and second  persons, they are the same as the personal possessive adjectives. The  reflexive possessive adjective of the third person is \"sia\", his, her,  its, their, formed by adding the ending \"-a\" to the reflexive pronoun  \"si\":       Mi havas miajn librojn sur mia tablo, I have my books on my table.     Johano perdis siajn librojn, John lost his (John's) books.     Mario estas en sia cxambro, Mary is in her room.     La birdoj flugis al sia arbo, the birds flew to their tree.                      PRONOMINAL USE OF POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES.    45. Possessive adjectives may be used predicatively, as \"the book is  mine,\" or may modify some word or words not expressed, as \"mine are  large.\" Instead of having special forms, like English \"mine\", \"yours\",  \"hers\", etc., Esperanto uses the regular possessive adjectives preceded  by the article:       La granda libro estas la mia, the large book is mine.     La via estas granda, la miaj estas belaj,        yours is large, mine are beautiful.     Ili havas la sian, sed ne la lian, they have theirs, but not his.     La iliaj sxajnas esti bonaj, theirs seem to be good.                                       VOCABULARY       diro = saying, remark.             mangxo = meal.     gxis = as far as, up to, down to.  nesto = nest.     hieraux = yesterday.               pasero = sparrow.     juna = young.                      patro = father.     kapti = to catch, to seize.        post, after, behind.     kato = cat.                        surprizi = to surprise.     kolera = angry.                    teni = to hold, to keep.     lavi = to wash.                    vizagxo = face.                                  READING LESSON.    1. Hieraux mi perdis mian grizan katon. 2. Ilia kato kaptis nian  birdon. 3. Via kolera diro surprizis mian patron. 4. Cxu la granda  kampo apartenas al sxia patro? 5.

Griza kato iris de la domo gxis la strato. Gxi vidis paseron antaux si,  kaj volis mangxi gxin. La kato staris post granda arbo, kaj kaptis la  paseron. La pasero diris \"Bona kato lavas sin antaux sia mangxo, sed vi  ne lavis vian vizagxon.\" La interesa diro surprizis la katon. La kato  ne tenis la paseron, sed komencis lavi sian vizagxon. La pasero flugis  de la kato gxis la arbo. La kolera kato diris \"Mi perdis mian mangxon,  cxar mi komencis lavi min antaux la mangxo!\" Nun la katoj ne lavas sin  antaux la mangxoj. Ili havas siajn mangxojn, kaj post la mangxoj ili  lavas la vizagxojn. La paseroj ne surprizas ilin nun, sed ili tenas la  paserojn. La katoj estas felicxaj, sed la paseroj ne estas felicxaj. La  junaj paseroj volas flugi al la nestoj en la arboj.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1.

When the verb in a sentence expresses motion, the word indicating  the place, person or thing toward which the motion is directed is given  the accusative ending. This is also true if the word is the complement  of any preposition which does not itself sufficiently indicate motion  in a certain direction. (The prepositions \"al\", to, toward, \"gxis\",  as far as, \"tra\", through, express motion in the direction of their  complements, and could not well be used except in a sentence whose verb  expresses motion. Consequently the accusative is not used after any of  these three):       Li iris gxardenon, he went to the garden (\"gardenward\").     La viro iros Bostonon, the man will go to Boston (\"Bostonward\").    [Footnote: Cf. English \"he went home,\" \"he went homeward,\" etc.]       Li estis en la gxardeno, kaj kuris en la domon,        he was in the garden and ran into the house.     Gxi ne estas sur la tablo, gxi falis sur la plankon,        it is not on the table, it fell upon the floor.     Ili falis sub la tablon gxis la planko,        they fell under the table as far as the floor        (direction expressed by whole prepositional phrase).     Mi iris tra la domo en mian cxambron,        I went through the house into my room.                     THE ARTICLE FOR THE POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVE.    47. In many sentences where the possessor is already sufficiently  indicated, English nevertheless uses a possessive adjective, as in \"I  wash my face,\" \"he shakes his head,\" but on the other hand omits it  entirely with certain words indicating relationship, as in \"Brother gave  it to me,\" etc. In both cases Esperanto uses the article instead of the  possessive adjective, unless the fact of possession is to be emphasized:       Mi lavas la vizagxon, I wash my face.     Li skuas la kapon, he shakes his head.     La patro estas alta, Father is tall.     Mi donis gxin al la patro, I gave it to Father.                                    APPOSITION.    48. English often uses the preposition \"of\" between two words where  no idea of possession really exists, as \"the city of Boston.\" Since  nouns used in apposition refer to the same thing, and are in the same  grammatical construction, Esperanto does not use a preposition:       La urbo Bostono estas granda, the city (of) Boston is large.     Mia amiko Johano estas alta, my friend John is tall.     Cxu vi ne konas min, vian amikon? do you not know me, your friend?                                     VOCABULARY       arabo = arab.                      meti = to put, to place.     baldaux = soon.                    nazo = nose.     Bostono = Boston.                  nur = only, merely.     frato = brother.                   pusxi = to push.     kamelo = camel.                    trans = across.     kapo = head.                       tuta = whole, entire, all.     kolo = neck.                       urbo = city.     korpo = body.                      varma = warm.                              LA ARABO KAJ LA KAMELO.    Arabo sidis en sia domo en la urbo. Apud domo trans la strato li vidis  kamelon. La kamelo iris trans la straton gxis la pordo, kaj diris al la  arabo, \"Frato, mi ne estas varma, mi volas meti nur la nazon en vian  varman domon.\" La arabo skuis la kapon, sed la kamelo metis la nazon tra  la pordo en la cxambron. La kamelo komencis pusxi sian tutan vizagxon  en la domon. Baldaux li havis la kapon gxis la kolo en la domo. Post la  kapo iris la kolo en gxin, kaj baldaux la tuta korpo estis en la domo.  La arabo estis kolera, cxar li ne volis havi tutan kamelon en sia domo.  Li kuris al la kamelo, kaptis lin, tenis lin, kaj diris, \"Frato, vi  volis meti nur la nazon en mian domon. La cxambro ne estas granda sed  gxi estas la mia, kaj mi preferas sidi en gxi.\" \"Via diro estas bona,\"  diris la kamelo, \"via domo ne estas granda, sed gxi estas varma, kaj mi  sxatas stari en gxi. Mi preferas stari kaj kusxi en gxi, kaj mi donos  al vi mian arbon trans la strato. Cxu vi ne volas iri sub la arbon?\"  Kaj la kamelo pusxis la arabon de lia domo en la straton de la urbo. La  kamelo nun trovis sin en varma cxambro, sed la juna arabo staris trans  la strato kaj ne estis varma.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. The cat ran across the street. 2. Across the street it found a  sparrow. 3. It caught the bird, but began to wash its face, and the  sparrow flew to the nest. 4.
