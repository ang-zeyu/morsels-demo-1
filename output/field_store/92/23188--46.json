The  leading-in spreader is also made of spruce and is 1-1/2 inches square  and 26 inches long. Bore three or four 5/8-inch holes at equidistant  points through this spreader and insert hard rubber tubes in them as  with the middle spreader.    Assembling the Aerial.--Begin by measuring off the length of each wire  to be used and see to it that all of them are of exactly the same  length. Now push the hard rubber insulators through the holes in the  middle spreader and thread the wires through the holes in the  insulators as shown at A in Fig 9.    Next twist the ends of each wire to the rings of the ball insulators  and then put the large withes on the middle of each of the end  spreaders; fix the other withes on the spreaders so that they will be  27 inches apart and fasten the ball insulators to the eyes in the  withes with the S-hooks. Now slip a thimble through the eye of one of  the long strain insulators, thread a length of stranded steel wire 1/4  inch in diameter through it and fasten the ends of it to the eyes in  the withes on the ends of the spreaders.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 9.--Middle Spreader.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 9.--One End of Aerial Complete.]    [Illustration: (C) Fig. 9.--Leading in Spreader.]    Finally fasten a 40-inch length of steel stranded wire to each of the  eyes of the withes on the middle of each of the spreaders, loop the  other end over the thimble and then wrap the end around the wires that  are fixed to the ends of the spreaders. One end of the aerial is shown  complete at B in Fig. 9, and from this you can see exactly how it is  assembled. Now cut off three or four pieces of wire 15 or 20 feet long  and twist and solder each one to one of the aerial wires; then slip  them through the hard rubber tubes in the leading-in spreader, bring  their free ends together as at C and twist and solder them to a length  of wire long enough to reach to your lightning switch or instruments.    Making a Good Ground.--Where you have to make a _ground_ you can do so  either by (1) burying sheets of zinc or copper in the moist earth; (2)  burying a number of wires in the moist earth, or (3) using a  _counterpoise_. To make a ground of the first kind take half a dozen  large sheets of copper or zinc, cut them into strips a foot wide,  solder them all together with other strips and bury them deeply in the  ground.    It is easier to make a wire ground, say of as many or more wires as  you have in your aerial and connect them together with cross wires. To  put such a ground in the earth you will have to use a plow to make the  furrows deep enough to insure them always being moist. In the  counterpoise ground you make up a system of wires exactly like your  aerial, that is, you insulate them just as carefully; then you support  them so that they will be as close to the ground as possible and yet  not touch it or anything else. This and the other two grounds just  described should be placed directly under the aerial wire if the best  results are to be had. In using a counterpoise you must bring the wire  from it up to and through another leading-in insulator to your  instruments.          CHAPTER III    SIMPLE TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE RECEIVING SETS      With a crystal detector receiving set you can receive either  telegraphic dots and dashes or telephonic speech and music. You can  buy a receiving set already assembled or you can buy the different  parts and assemble them yourself. An assembled set is less bother in  the beginning but if you like to experiment you can _hook up_, that  is, connect the separate parts together yourself and it is perhaps a  little cheaper to do it this way. Then again, by so doing you get a  lot of valuable experience in wireless work and an understanding of  the workings of wireless that you cannot get in any other way.    Assembled Wireless Receiving Sets.--The cheapest assembled receiving  set [Footnote: The Marvel, made by the Radio Mfg. Co., New York City.]  advertised is one in which the detector and tuning coil is mounted in  a box. It costs $15.00, and can be bought of dealers in electric  supplies generally.    This price also includes a crystal detector, an adjustable tuning  coil, a single telephone receiver with head-band and the wire,  porcelain insulators, lightning switch and ground clamp for the aerial  wire system. It will receive wireless telegraph and telephone messages  over a range of from 10 to 25 miles.    Another cheap unit receptor, that is, a complete wireless receiving  set already mounted which can be used with a single aerial is sold for  $25.00. [Footnote: The Aeriola Jr., made by the Westinghouse Company,  Pittsburgh, Pa.] This set includes a crystal detector, a variable  tuning coil, a fixed condenser and a pair of head telephone receivers.  It can also be used to receive either telegraph or telephone messages  from distances up to 25 miles. The aerial equipment is not included in  this price, but it can be bought for about $2.50 extra.    Assembling Your Own Receiving Set.--In this chapter we shall go only  into the apparatus used for two simple receiving sets, both of which  have a _crystal detector_. The first set includes a _double-slide  tuning coil_ and the second set employs a _loose-coupled tuning coil_,  or _loose coupler_, as it is called for short. For either set you can  use a pair of 2,000- or 3,000-ohm head phones.    [Illustration: original (C) Underwood and Underwood. General Pershing  Listening In.]    The Crystal Detector.--A crystal detector consists of: (1) _the  frame_, (2) _the crystal_, and (3) _the wire point_. There are any  number of different designs for frames, the idea being to provide a  device that will (a) hold the sensitive crystal firmly in place, and  yet permit of its removal, (b) to permit the _wire point_, or  _electrode_, to be moved in any direction so that the free point of it  can make contact with the most sensitive spot on the crystal and (c)  to vary the pressure of the wire on the crystal.    A simple detector frame is shown in the cross-section at A in Fig. 10;  the crystal, which may be _galena_, _silicon_ or _iron pyrites_, is  held securely in a holder while the _phosphor-bronze wire point_ which  makes contact with it, is fixed to one end of a threaded rod on the  other end of which is a knob. This rod screws into and through a  sleeve fixed to a ball that sets between two brass standards and this  permits an up and down or a side to side adjustment of the metal point  while the pressure of it on the crystal is regulated by the screw.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 10.--Cross Section of Crystal Detector.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 10.--The Crystal Detector Complete.]    A crystal of this kind is often enclosed in a glass cylinder and this  makes it retain its sensitiveness for a much longer time than if it  were exposed to dust and moisture. An upright type of this detector  can be bought for $2.25, while a horizontal type, as shown at B, can  be bought for $2.75. Galena is the crystal that is generally used,  for, while it is not quite as sensitive as silicon and iron pyrites,  it is easier to obtain a sensitive piece.    The Tuning Coil.--It is with the tuning coil that you _tune in_ and  _tune out_ different stations and this you do by sliding the contacts  to and fro over the turns of wire; in this way you vary the  _inductance_ and _capacitance_, that is, the _constants_ of the  receiving circuits and so make them receive _electric waves_, that is,  wireless waves, of different lengths.    The Double Slide Tuning Coil.--With this tuning coil you can receive  waves from any station up to 1,000 meters in length. One of the ends  of the coil of wire connects with the binding post marked _a_ in Fig.  11, and the other end connects with the other binding post marked _b_,  while one of the sliding contacts is connected to the binding post  _c_, and the _other sliding contact_ is connected with the binding  post _d_.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 11.--Schematic Diagram of Double Slide Tuning  Coil.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 11.--Double Slide Tuning Coil Complete.]    When connecting in the tuning coil, only the post _a_ or the post _b_  is used as may be most convenient, but the other end of the wire which  is connected to a post is left free; just bear this point in mind when  you come to connect the tuning coil up with the other parts of your  receiving set. The tuning coil is shown complete at B and it costs  $3.00 or $4.00. A _triple slide_ tuning coil constructed like the  double slide tuner just described, only with more turns of wire on it,  makes it possible to receive wave lengths up to 1,500 meters. It costs  about $6.00.    The Loose Coupled Tuning Coil.--With a _loose coupler_, as this kind  of a tuning coil is called for short, very _selective tuning_ is  possible, which means that you can tune in a station very sharply, and  it will receive any wave lengths according to size of coils. The  primary coil is wound on a fixed cylinder and its inductance is varied  by means of a sliding contact like the double slide tuning coil  described above. The secondary coil is wound on a cylinder that slides  in and out of the primary coil. The inductance of this coil is varied  by means of a switch that makes contact with the fixed points, each of  which is connected with every twentieth turn of wire as shown in the  diagram A in Fig. 12. The loose coupler, which is shown complete at B,  costs in the neighborhood of $8.00 or $10.00.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 12.--Schematic Diagram of Loose Coupler.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 12.--Loose Coupler Complete.]    Fixed and Variable Condensers.--You do not require a condenser for a  simple receiving set, but if you will connect a _fixed condenser_  across your headphones you will get better results, while a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#7)"],[1,"and asked him for a match, making a return compliment of a cigarette.  This was a procedure against established British social usage in the  East, where it is considered _infra dig_ to meet a native on a social  footing.  Herein lies a grave danger to English colonial policy.  Your  semi-European educated native, having partly absorbed European  manners, resents this subordination and ostracism.  So, with this  high-spirited, rather clever young rajah.  I accepted his invitation  to whiskey \"pegs\" and subsequent dinner at his bungalow.  One visit  led to another and we were soon rather intimate.  The young Rajah,  having the usual native taste for luxury well developed and his income  stopped, I became of some monetary assistance to him.  Also,  judiciously fostering his discontent against the government, I soon  had him in a desired frame of mind.  Through his influence on the  native clerks, I was able to gain all the plans, data and photographs  of England's new naval base in the Straits Settlement.    By this time my close association with this notorious young Rajah was  marked and I found it advisable to pull up stakes, which I did in  short order, arranging passage on the N. D. L. liner _Sachsen_,  homeward bound.  Having a week to spare and finding that by leaving  the _Sachsen_ at Colombo, I could catch the _Prinz Regent Leopold_ of  the same line, coming up from Australia en route for Europe, I had my  ticket transferred.  This would give me a ten-day vacation in Ceylon,  where I had a number of acquaintances, having hunted there during my  early travels.  Accordingly, at Colombo I put up at the Galle Face  Hotel, and the first man I met was Allan MacGregor, one of Lipton's  tea estate managers, in Kandy and Newara Elya.  MacGregor and I were  old pals, having done much hunting and bridge playing in days gone by.  I planned to spend a week with him and go after some leopards.  By the  by, I'd like to see the MacGregor's face when he learns that his  quondam friend and boon companion was an international spy!    \"Dinna get sair, Mac.  You're no the only chiel what'll tak a wee  surprise.\"    I was just arranging a hunting trip with MacGregor when Bill Peters,  manager of the hotel, another old acquaintance, handed me a cable  knocking all my plans to bits.  It was a cipher message from Captain  von Tappken, and shortly I was again on the high sea, bound not for  home, but for Port Arthur.  My orders were to ascertain how far the  Port Arthur fortifications were completed and to report on the general  conditions as I found them.  I wondered not a little at this mission,  as I could not then see what close interest Germany could have in a  possible war between Russia and Japan.  Also, I by no means relished  the assignment, for it was a perilous business and I judged the  Russians to be extremely suspicious--which I afterwards learned they  were not.    I decided to travel under the cloak of a doctor of natural history and  botany, my medical training giving me the necessary knowledge to  impersonate the character.  The reader will understand that if Doctor  Franz von Cannitz is subsequently mentioned, it refers to me.  Almost  everybody, especially my government, knew that war between Russia and  Japan was inevitable.  I say, all, except Russia.    To make this situation clear, let me hark back a little.  Japan,  beating China in the war of 1895, took and occupied Port Arthur.  Japan later, compelled by hostile demonstrations on the part of Russia  backed up by France and Germany, restored Port Arthur to China.  Note  the holding aloof of England here.  The actual text of the ultimatum  delivered was that the possession of ceded territory by Japan would be  detrimental to the lasting peace of the Orient.  Japan was bitterly  humiliated and an Asiatic never forgets or forgives.  Japan bided her  time.  Russia's duplicity in the Boxer Campaign, and her seizure of  Port Arthur, gave Japan the needed _casus belli_.  Result, the  Russian-Japanese War.    Arriving in Port Arthur, I established myself at the Hotel l'Europe  and with prospecting spade, botanical trowel and butterfly net, I  sallied forth around the hills of Port Arthur.  The first thing which  struck me was the enormous number of Chinese and Chunshuses (bad  Coolies) employed everywhere.  I came to know that they were not all  Chinese Coolies and that almost every tenth man was a disguised  Japanese.  To an observer, trained in the facial characteristics of  the Oriental, it was not difficult to pick out the Japanese from the  mass of Coolies.  They fairly swarmed in Port Arthur right under the  very noses of the Russians.  As Baron Huraki had told me during our  passage on the _Bayern_, his countrymen were actually employed in the  building of the Port Arthur defenses!  These Japanese w ere later able  to give invaluable information in directing the Japanese batteries.  Numerous other alleged Coolies were acting as servants to Russian  officers.  I also found that on the Lioa Teah Shan Railway and at  Pidgeon Bay the very porters were Japanese.  In fact, the entire  Russian stronghold was infested with them.    This carelessness, lack of knowledge or suspicion, with a total lack  of belief on the part of the Russian officers, that the \"little monkey  men\" would ever dare attack, is in my opinion the chief cause of the  comparatively quick fall of Port Arthur.  For even with the  incompleted defenses the place was tremendously strong.  Everywhere I  could see the most elaborate plans incomplete.  For instance, as I  wandered through the hills seeking my botanical specimens, I found  that the chain of forts on the hills of the Quang Tong peninsula south  and west of Dalny, were totally unfinished and that the Kuan Ling  section of the Port Arthur and Dalny railway was not even adequately  protected from capture by a hostile force.  The lack of adequate  supervision and the general slovenliness prevailing made it easy for  me to go about unchallenged.  I mixed freely with officers and men.  The expenditure of a few rubles on _vodka_, in the case of the men,  and the never-rejected invitation on the part of most officers to join  in a jamboree, made me a very popular figure indeed.  Through them I  learned that the provisions of Port Arthur were in a most deplorable  state.  To use but one instance: Out of 1,420,000 pounds of flour,  nearly one-half was bad with sour cords, which caused part of the  enormous amount of sickness even then prevailing in the Port Arthur  garrison.  During the war forty-five per cent. of the troops were  incapacitated because of unsanitary food.  I found 600,000 pounds of  maize were wormy and over 700,000 pounds of corned beef were putrid.  Women and wine, however, abounded.    Never in any place--and I know all the gayest and fastest places on  earth--have I seen, comparatively speaking, such an enormous amount of  wine in stock, or such a number of demi-mondaines assembled.  Most of  the officers had private harems.  I often sat in the Casino and  watched the officers of the First Tomsk Regiment, the Twenty-fifth and  Twenty-sixth Siberian Rides practicing with their newly supplied  Mauser-pistols on tables loaded with bottles containing the most  costly vintage wines and cognacs.  At such times the place literally  ran ankle deep in wine.  There were over sixty gambling houses and  dancing halls supporting more than a thousand _filles de joie_.  In  fact, the general intemperance was such that on the night of Admiral  Togo's attack more than half the complement of the Russian fleet was  ashore, dead drunk, in honor of one of the tutelary Russian saints.    The harbor defenses comprising submarine mines and searchlight  stations, etc., I found to be in the worst condition.  In pottering  around, I visited many of the switchboard stations controlling the  submarine mine fields.  Everywhere the eye met evidences of defective  work--rusty contacts, open insulations and exposed connections.  There  were carelessly exposed buoys betraying to the naked eye supposedly  invisible submarine mines.  The whole mine field was so badly laid  that the Japanese were subsequently able to drag and explode three out  of every five mines.  This explains the astounding fact that during  Admiral Togo's five dashes, some of them lasting thirty-six hours, all  that he lost from torpedoes and mines was one ship, the _Hatsuse_,  which struck a floating mine.    I did a great deal of investigating the composition and geological  formation of the ground surrounding Port Arthur.  I found most of the  ground consisting of loose layers of lava scoriÃ¦.  The comparative  easy capture of the otherwise immensely strong 203 Metre Hill did not  surprise me.  The texture of the ground, besides having a deadening  effect on shell fire, made the approach to the forts by means of  parallels surprisingly easy.  The Japanese, by the way, also knew this  peculiarity of the ground and used it to great advantage in their  advances.  I also found the forts on 174 and 131 Metre Hills as well  as the north fort of East Rekwan in an incompleted state.  The  commander of the forts, General Smyrnoff, was using strenuous efforts  to complete the work, but the personal animosity of General  Krondrachinko, the commander of the general defenses, vetoed most of  his suggestions.  The vast sums of money which the Russian central  government appropriated for the fortification of Port Arthur, honestly  used, would have made the place completely impregnable.  It is not too  much to say--and this will be borne out by any trained observer and  student of the conditions then existing in and around Port  Arthur--that sixty per cent. of the money for defense purposes  disappeared mysteriously.    All the Russian officers, however, were not grafters and drunken  libertines.  Among them I did find men of alert and earnest character  who were quite aware of the frightful"]]]
