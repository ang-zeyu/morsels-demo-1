They gave him some  milk and borax, such as children drink in England.    Death arose ravening, strong, and strode again through the cities.          THE LONELY IDOL      I had from a friend an old outlandish stone, a little swine-faced idol  to whom no one prayed.    And when I saw his melancholy case as he sat cross-legged at  receipt of prayer, holding a little scourge that the years had broken  (and no one heeded the scourge and no one prayed and no one  came with squealing sacrifice; and he had been a god), then I took  pity on the little forgotten thing and prayed to it as perhaps they prayed  long since, before the coming of the strange dark ships, and humbled  myself and said:    \"O idol, idol of the hard pale stone, invincible to the years, O  scourge-holder, give ear for behold I pray.    \"O little pale-green image whose wanderings are from far, know  thou that here in Europe and in other lands near by, too soon there  pass from us the sweets and song and the lion strength of youth:  too soon do their cheeks fade, their hair grow grey and our beloved  die; too brittle is beauty, too far off is fame and the years are gathered  too soon; there are leaves, leaves falling, everywhere falling; there is  autumn among men, autumn and reaping; failure there is, struggle,  dying and weeping, and all that is beautiful hath not remained but is  even as the glory of morning upon the water.    \"Even our memories are gathered too with the sound of the ancient  voices, the pleasant ancient voices that come to our ears no more;  the very gardens of our childhood fade, and there dims with the speed  of the years even the mind's own eye.    \"O be not any more the friend of Time, for the silent hurry of his  malevolent feet have trodden down what's fairest; I almost hear the  whimper of the years running behind him hound-like, and it takes few  to tear us.    \"All that is beautiful he crushes down as a big man tramples daises,  all that is fairest. How very fair are the little children of men. It is  autumn with all the world, and the stars weep to see it.    \"Therefore no longer be the friend of Time, who will not let us be,  and be not good to him but pity us, and let lovely things live on for  the sake of our tears.\"    Thus prayed I out of compassion one windy day to the snout-faced  idol to whom no one kneeled.          THE SPHINX IN THEBES (MASSACHUSETTS)      There was a woman in a steel-built city who had all that money  could buy, she had gold and dividends and trains and houses, and  she had pets to play with, but she had no sphinx.    So she besought them to bring her a live sphinx; and therefore they  went to the menageries, and then to the forests and the desert places,  and yet could find no sphinx.    And she would have been content with a little lion but that one was  already owned by a woman she knew; so they had to search the  world again for a sphinx.    And still there was none.    But they were not men that it is easy to baffle, and at last they found  a sphinx in a desert at evening watching a ruined temple whose gods  she had eaten hundreds of years ago when her hunger was on her.  And they cast chains on her, who was still with an ominous stillness,  and took her westwards with them and brought her home.    And so the sphinx came to the steel-built city.    And the woman was very glad that she owned a sphinx: but the  sphinx stared long into her eyes one day, and softly asked a riddle  of the woman.    And the woman could not answer, and she died.    And the sphinx is silent again and none knows what she will do.          THE REWARD      One's spirit goes further in dreams than it does by day. Wandering  once by night from a factory city I came to the edge of Hell.    The place was foul with cinders and cast-off things, and jagged,  half-buried things with shapeless edges, and there was a huge angel  with a hammer building in plaster and steel. I wondered what he did  in that dreadful place. I hesitated, then asked him what he was  building. \"We are adding to Hell,\" he said, \"to keep pace with the  times.\" \"Don't be too hard on them,\" I said, for I had just come out  of a compromising age and a weakening country. The angel did not  answer. \"It won't be as bad as the old hell, will it?\" I said. \"Worse,\"  said the angel.    \"How can you reconcile it with your conscience as a Minister of  Grace,\" I said, \"to inflict such a punishment?\" (They talked like this  in the city whence I had come and I could not avoid the habit of it.)    \"They have invented a new cheap yeast,\" said the angel.    I looked at the legend on the walls of the hell that the angel was  building, the words were written in flame, every fifteen seconds they  changed their color, \"Yeasto, the great new yeast, it builds up body  and brain, and something more.\"    \"They shall look at it for ever,\" the angel said.    \"But they drove a perfectly legitimate trade,\" I said, \"the law allowed  it.\"    The angel went on hammering into place the huge steel uprights.    \"You are very revengeful,\" I said. \"Do you never rest from doing  this terrible work?\"    \"I rested one Christmas Day,\" the angel said, \"and looked and  saw little children dying of cancer. I shall go on now until the fires  are lit.\"    \"It is very hard to prove,\" I said, \"that the yeast is as bad as you  think.\"    \"After all,\" I said, \"they must live.\"    And the angel made no answer but went on building his hell.          THE TROUBLE IN LEAFY GREEN STREET      She went to the idol-shop in Moleshill Street, where the old man  mumbles, and said: \"I want a god to worship when it is wet.\"    The old man reminded her of the heavy penalties that rightly attach  to idolatry and, when he had enumerated all, she answered him as  was meet: \"Give me a god to worship when it is wet.\"    And he went to the back places of his shop and sought out and  brought her a god. The same was carved of grey stone and wore a  propitious look and was named, as the old man mumbled, The God  of Rainy Cheerfulness.    Now it may be that long confinement to the house affects adversely  the liver, or these things may be of the soul, but certain it is that on  a rainy day her spirits so far descended that those cheerful creatures  came within sight of the Pit, and, having tried cigarettes to no good  end, she bethought her of Moleshill Street and the mumbling man.    He brought the grey idol forth and mumbled of guarantees, although  he put nothing on paper, and she paid him there and then his  preposterous price and took the idol away.    And on the next wet day that there ever was she prayed to the  grey-stone idol that she had bought, the God of Rainy Cheerfulness  (who knows with what ceremony or what lack of it?), and so  brought down on her in Leafy Green Street, in the preposterous  house at the corner, that doom of which all men speak.          THE MIST      The mist said unto the mist: \"Let us go up into the Downs.\" And  the mist came up weeping.    And the mist went into the high places and the hollows.    And clumps of trees in the distance stood ghostly in the haze.    But I went to a prophet, one who loved the Downs, and I said to  him: \"Why does the mist come up weeping into the Downs when it  goes into the high places and the hollows?\"    And he answered: \"The mist is the company of a multitude of souls  who never saw the Downs, and now are dead. Therefore they come  up weeping into the Downs, who are dead and never saw them.\"          FURROW-MAKER      He was all in black, but his friend was dressed in brown, members  of two old families.    \"Is there any change in the way you build your houses?\" said he in  black.    \"No change,\" said the other. \"And you?\"    \"We change not,\" he said.    A man went by in the distance riding a bicycle.    \"He is always changing,\" said the one in black, \"of late almost every  century. He is uneasy. Always changing.\"    \"He changes the way he builds his house, does he not?\" said the  brown one.    \"So my family say,\" said the other. \"They say he has changed of late.\"    \"They say he takes much to cities?\" the brown one said.    \"My cousin who lives in belfries tells me so,\" said the black one.  \"He says he is much in cities.\"    \"And there he grows lean?\" said the brown one.    \"Yes, he grows lean.\"    \"Is it true what they say?\" said the brown one.    \"Caw,\" said the black one.    \"Is it true that he cannot live many centuries?\"    \"No, no,\" said the black one. \"Furrow-maker will not die. We must  not lose furrow-maker. He has been foolish of late, he has played  with smoke and is sick. His engines have wearied him and his cities  are evil. Yes, he is very sick. But in a few centuries he will forget  his folly and we shall not lose furrow-maker. Time out of mind he  has delved and my family have got their food from the raw earth  behind him. He will not die.\"    \"But they say, do they not?\" said the brown one, \"his cities are  noisome, and that he grows sick in them and can run no longer, and  that it is with him as it is with us when we grow too many, and the  grass has the bitter taste in the rainy season, and our young grow  bloated and die.\"    \"Who says it?\" replied the black one.    \"Pigeon,\" the brown one answered. \"He came back all dirty.  And Hare went down to the edge of the cities once. He says it  too. Man was too sick to chase him. He thinks that Man will die,  and his wicked friend Dog with him. Dog, he will die. That nasty  fellow Dog. He will die too, the dirty fellow!\"    \"Pigeon and Hare!\" said the black one. \"We shall not lose  furrow-maker.\"    \"Who told you he will not die?\" his brown friend said.    \"Who told me!\" the black one said. \"My family and his have  understood each other times out of mind.

I hope you will find it, my lad, and that it will help you and  Jenny to make a happy home. Good bye.\"    \"Good bye,\" said Jack, as he pressed his friend's hand warmly, for he had  grown to like the kindhearted gentleman.    Fret Offut nodded lightly to the other, as he entered the boat which was  to take them to the vessel.    The trip to Valparaiso was uneventful, but there Jack met with a great  disappointment.    The _Standish_ had left for its homeward voyage.    Thus Jack found himself left alone among strangers, save for the  companionship of Fret Offut, who seemed disposed to hold aloof from him.  The other had refused to tell him the cause of his being hunted by the  Chilians, though Jack suspected that it was in some way the result of his  attack upon him. Fret had told enough in his sleep for our hero to know  that he had been arrested for the deed, and that he had afterwards  escaped. But Jack did not feel like saying anything to Fret about it, as  long as he showed no inclination to mention the subject.    Knowing that it might be several months before he could return to his home  and being short of money, Jack at once began to look about for an  opportunity to earn a living.  Unable to find anything to do in  Valparaiso, he walked to Tocopilla, though Fret declined to accompany him.  In this town he found work as a machinist at the princely income of four  Spanish dollars a week. But this was better than nothing and he went to  work with a hearty good will.    He worked in Tocopilla steadily for a month. During the time he heard  nothing from home or from Fret Offut.    He still kept the paper describing the mysterious island holding its vast,  hidden treasure, but he had not felt like undertaking the long journey  necessary to search for it.    Seeing no prospect of advance in his position, Jack was beginning to think  of seeking his fortune elsewhere, when his whole future life was changed  into a different groove by the appearance of a stranger at the place where  he was working.    The newcomer was a Peruvian, who had been an engineer on a railroad  running through the southern part of Peru, but had left to come to  Tocopilla.    He and Jack soon became friends, when the latter said to him one day:    \"What was the trouble with engineering, that you should leave to come  here, where you can't begin to get the pay you did there?\"    \"The pay was good enough, but the shooting was better. I care more for my  life than I do for a few silver doubloons.\"    \"I am afraid I do not understand you. I was not aware that shooting and  engineering went together.\"    \"They do in the case of the St. Resa road, Jack.\"    \"Tell me about it, Francis. I am interested.\"    \"Then I can take out that interest shortly. The road runs through  debatable ground from St. Resa to de la Pama. Not an inch of it but what  is being hotly contested. But it isn't the regulars that make the trouble,  for at present the territory belongs to Peru, though how soon she will  lose it is not for me to say. It's the murderous bush-raiders that are  making the trouble.\"    \"Who are the bush-raiders?\"    \"That question shows a lamentable ignorance. The bush-raiders are bands of  guerillas united to make war upon anybody and anything that crosses their  path. They pretend to favor Chili, but they are merely using that for a  cloak, and are robbers of the worst class, outlawed by all governments. Of  course you know that Chili and Peru are at war?\"    \"I have heard of it.\"    \"Well, these bush-raiders, pretending to favor Chili, are making hot times  all along the St. Resa. It is necessary to keep the road open if Peru  hopes to hold the country, and the company are doing their best, backed by  the government. They have had as many as twenty men on in the last six  months.    \"The three men on before me were killed by the bush-raiders, and the one  before the first of them fell off and was killed while running the gantlet  of fire set by the fiends.\"    \"You say the road is all in Peru?\"    \"Yes, in Southern Peru. It runs through the nitrate regions. Bless me if I  don't think there is a fortune in those mines if properly worked.    \"Say, Jack, if you are dissatisfied with the money you are making here  there is an opportunity for you. You are young and full of fire, just such  a rash head as the bush-raiders like to get hold of. The company is  offering as high as twenty pistoles a month for a man to run that engine.  More for one day than you get here in a week. But bless me, if every  pistole was a doubloon and I had as many of them as I could carry I would  not try another trip. What are a few paltry pistoles to a man's life?\"    \"I believe I would like to get that position as engineer on the St. Resa,\"  said Jack, after a moment's pause. \"I can run an engine, you know.\"    \"You have only to apply for it,\" replied the other. \"But say, Jack, if you  should be fool enough to go up to get killed on that old engine, you had  better take a fireman along with you, for you will not be able to find a  helper up that way.\"    Another silence fell upon the twain, during which Jack's hands were not as  busy as his brains, until finally he laid aside his work, saying in his  blunt way:    \"I shall start within a week for St. Resa, unless in the meantime I get  some sort of word from John Fowler & Company, or from my folks.\"    After that the days flew by on the wings of the wind. Eagerly Jack waited  for some kind of word from his home, but not a letter reached him, for the  reason that his folks were very poor and had many troubles of their own,  and because the manufacturing company that had sent him to South America  were in financial difficulties.    Sunday passed and then Monday, and the week came to an end. Jack had  another talk with the Peruvian about the railroad position and then  slapped his hands together.    \"I'm going to have a try at it, come what may,\" he said, determinedly.          Chapter IX    Jack Becomes an Engineer        Jack as usual, was as good as his word.    He stopped long enough to lay down his tools and seek the foreman for a  leave of absence.    \"Going to St. Resa? You will make the journey but one way. You will never  come back.\"    But Jack was determined, and nothing that the other could tell him of the  perils he was sure to encounter could deter him from his purpose.    An hour later he turned his back on Tocopilla.    He was passing one of the outer gates, near the edge of the city, when he  was stopped by one of the many beggars which invest the town.    \"Only a miserable pittance,\" implored the ragged wretch, holding out a  dirty hand for the gift.    Something in the beggar's tone and manner arrested Jack's attention. He  had been addressed in English, which was unusual, but there was more than  the language to attract him to the poor alms seeker.    Then, as he bent a closer gaze on the person, he exclaimed:    \"Fret Offut! can this be you?\"    \"Jack North!\" exclaimed the other. \"I did not think of seeing you here.\"    \"Nor I you, most of all in this condition.\"    \"It was all I could do, Jack,\" whined the other. \"I have had such bad luck  since you left me! But ain't you looking like a peacock!\"    \"I have managed to get a living by working hard.\"    \"I'll warrant you have; but I wouldn't work at the starvation wages they  offered me. Say, where are you going?\"    \"To St. Resa.\"    \"In South Peru?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What do you expect to do there?\"    \"Going to apply for a situation as engineer on a railroad.\"    \"Whew! I heard a man say this morning they were offering big pay. Let me  go with you, Jack? You will do this for old time's sake? I will be  fireman.\"    Jack's first thought was to refuse the other's company. He felt that Fret  had already done him harm enough, and that his presence would be a  positive injury to him. But upon second thought he became more generous.  In spite of all Fret had done against him he could not help pitying the  young fellow now in his forlorn condition, and thus he said:    \"If you will promise that you will not try to make trouble for me and that  you will do the very best you can for yourself. You mustn't forget, too,  that you are going where you may not come back alive.\"    Fret Offut promised very solemnly to all that Jack asked, and the couple  started on their hazardous journey into the interior of the country which  was about to become the battleground of three nations.    They received a warm welcome at the railroad company's office as soon as  the object of their call was known. It had been a week since the last  train had gone over the route, and a big accumulation of freight wanted to  be moved. They were offered big wages and accepted.    \"Well, Fret, we're in for it now,\" said Jack, as they went to the station  to make their first trip.    The young fireman made no reply. He was already beginning to regret the  step he had taken, though Jack's fearlessness was not without its effect  on him.    A big crowd was at the station to see the train start, which made Fret  feel the importance of his position.    The train had a fifty-mile run and Jack found that he was expected to make  it and return the same day. This did not seem a difficult task, providing  the bush-raiders let them alone.    The road was in a terrible condition, yet the first trip was made without  adventure and Fret's spirits rose.    \"Probably the bush-raiders did not know we were going yesterday,\" said  Jack, as his helper was boasting of their easy job.    Jack could not say as much when he got back from his second trip, for no  less than three shots had been fired into the caboose.    Fret Offut was in genuine alarm. The situation was worse than had been  described to Jack. Reports showed that the bush-raiders were gaining in  numbers every day, and growing more bold as they"]]]
