Our boat was sloop-rigged, and carried three officers, a  passenger, and ten men. At 11 A.M. we \"sheeted home,\" and stood out of the  harbor with a fair breeze, and all canvass spread: but, within an hour,  the wind freshened to a gale, and compelled us to take in everything but a  close reefed mainsail. The sea being rough, and the weather squally, our  boat took in more water than was either agreeable or safe, until we  somewhat improved matters by constructing a temporary forecastle of  tarpaulins. Finding it impossible, however, to contend against wind and  current, we bore up for an anchorage called Santa Cruz. This was formerly  a notorious haunt for pirates; but no vestige of a settlement remains,  save the ruins of an old stone house, which may probably have been the  theatre of wild and bloody incidents, in by-gone years. The serrated hills  are grey and barren, and the surrounding country shows no verdure.  Anchoring here, we waited several hours for the wind to moderate, and  tried to get such sleep as might perchance be caught in an unsteady boat.    By great diligence in working against wind and current, we succeeded in  reaching Genella at 9 o'clock in the evening of the second day. Our  mulatto pilot, Manuel Quatrine, whistled shrilly through his fingers; and,  after a brief delay, the response of a similar whistle reached our ears  from shore. A conversation was sustained for some moments, by means of  shouts to-and-fro in Portuguese; a man then swam off to reconnoitre; and,  on his return, the people launched a canoe and carried us ashore, weary  enough of thirty-six hours' confinement in an open boat. We took up our  quarters in the house of a decent negro, who seemed to be the head man of  the village, and, after eating such a supper as the place could supply,  sallied out to give the women an opportunity of preparing our beds.    Meanwhile, the pilot had not been idle. Though a married man, and the  father of six children, he was a gay Lothario, and a great favorite with  the sex; he could sing, dance, and touch the guitar with infinite spirit,  and tolerable skill. Being well known in the village, it is not surprising  that the arrival of so accomplished a personage should have disturbed the  slumbers of the inhabitants. At ten o'clock, a dance was arranged before  the door of one of the huts. The dark-skinned maidens, requiring but  little time to put on their ball-costume, came dropping in, until, before  midnight, there were thirty or forty dancers on foot. The figures were  compounded of the contra-dance and reel, with some remarkable touches of  the Mandingo balance. The music proceeded from one or two guitars, which,  however, were drowned a great part of the time, by the singing of the  girls and the clapping of each individual pair of hands in the whole  party. A calabash of sour wine, munificently bestowed by a spectator,  increased the fun, and it continued to wax higher and more furious, as the  night wore away. Our little pilot was, throughout, the leader of the  frolic, and acquitted himself admirably. His nether garments having  received serious detriment in the voyage, he borrowed a large heavy  pea-jacket, to conceal the rents, and in this garb danced for hours with  the best, in a sultry night. Long before the festivity was over, my  companions and myself stretched ourselves on a wide bag of straw, and fell  asleep, lulled by the screaming of the dancers.    The next morning we were early on foot, and looked around us with no small  interest. The village is situated at the point where a valley opens upon  the shore. The sides of this vale are steep, and, in many places, high,  perpendicular, and rocky. Every foot of earth is cultivated; and where the  natural inclination of the hill is too great to admit of tillage, stone  walls are built to sustain terraces, which rise one over another like  giant steps to the mountain-tops. It was the beginning of harvest, and the  little valley presented an appearance of great fertility. Corn, bananas,  figs, guavas, grapes, oranges, sugar-cane, cocoa-nuts, and many other  fruits and vegetables, are raised in abundance. The annual vintage in this  and a neighboring valley, appertaining to the same parish, amounts to  about seventy-five pipes of wine. It is sour and unpalatable, not unlike  hard-cider and water. When a cultivator first tries his wine, it is a  custom of the island for him to send notice to all his acquaintances, who  invariably come in great force, each bringing a piece of salt-fish to keep  his thirst alive. Not unfrequently, the whole produce of the season is  exhausted by a single carouse.    The people are all negroes and mulattoes. Male and female, they are very  expert swimmers, and are often in the habit of swimming out to sea, with a  basket or notched stick to hold their fish; and thus they angle for hours,  resting motionless on the waves, unless attacked by a shark. In this  latter predicament, they turn upon their backs, and kick and splash until  the sea-monster be frightened away. They appear to be a genial and  pleasant-tempered race. As we walked through the village, they saluted us  with \"Blessed be the name of the Lord!\" Whether this expression (a  customary courtesy of the islanders) were mere breath, or proceeded out of  the depths of the heart, is not for us to judge; but, at all events, heard  in so wild and romantic a place, it made a forcible impression on my mind.  When we were ready to depart, all the villagers came to the beach, with  whatever commodities they were disposed to offer for sale; a man carrying  a squealing pig upon his shoulders; women with fruits and fowls; girls  with heavy bunches of bananas or bundles of cassada on their heads; and  boys, with perhaps a single egg. Each had something, and all lingered on  the shore until our boat was fairly off.    Five or six miles further, we landed at Paolo, where reside several  families who regard themselves as the aristocracy of St. Antonio, on the  score of being connected with Senor Martinez, the great man of these  islands. Their houses are neatly built, and the fields and gardens well  cultivated. They received us hospitably, principally because one of our  party was a connection of the family. I was delighted with an exhibition  of feeling on the part of an old negro servant-woman. She came into the  parlor, sat down at the feet of our companion, embraced his knees, and  looked up in his face with a countenance full of joy, mingled with respect  and confidence. We saw but two ladies at this settlement. One was a matron  with nine children; the other a dark brunette, very graceful and pleasing,  with the blackest eyes and whitest teeth in the world. She wore a shawl  over the right shoulder and under the left arm, arranged in a truly  fascinating manner.    The poorer classes in the vicinity are nearly all colored, and mostly  free. They work for eight or ten cents a day, living principally on fruit  and vegetables, and are generally independent, because their few wants are  limited to the supply. The richest persons live principally within  themselves, and derive their meats, vegetables, fruits, wine, brandy,  sugar, coffee, oil, and most other necessaries and luxuries, from their  own plantations. One piece of furniture, however, to be seen in several of  the houses, was evidently not the manufacture of the island, but an export  of Yankee-land. It was the wooden clock, in its shining mahogany case,  adorned with bright red and yellow pictures of Saints and the Virgin, to  suit the taste of good Catholics. It might have been fancied that the  renowned Sam Slick, having glutted all other markets with his wares, had  made a voyage to St. Antonio. Nor did they lack a proper artist to keep  the machine in order. We met here a person whom we at first mistook for a  native, so identical were his manners and appearance with those of the  inhabitants; until, in conversation, we found him to be a Yankee, who had  run away from a whale-ship, and established himself as a clock and  watch-maker.    After a good night's rest, another officer and myself left Paolo, early,  for a mountain ride. The little pilot led the way on a donkey; my friend  followed on a mule, and I brought up the rear on horseback. We began to  ascend, winding along the rocky path, one by one, there being no room to  ride two abreast. The road had been cut with much labor, and, in some  places, was hollowed out of the side of the cliff, thus forming a gallery  of barely such height and width as to admit the passage of a single  horseman, and with a low wall of loose stones between the path and the  precipice. At other points, causeways of small stones and earth had been  built up, perhaps twenty feet high, along the top of which ran the path.  On looking at these places from some projecting point, it made us shudder  to think that we had just passed, where the loosening of a single one of  those small stones might have carried us down hundreds of feet, to certain  destruction. The whole of the way was rude and barren. Here and there a  few shrubs grew in the crevices of the rocks, or wild flowers, of an  aspect strange to our eyes, wasted their beauty in solitude; and the small  orchilla weed spread itself moss-like over the face of the cliff. At one  remarkable point, the path ran along the side of the precipice, about  midway of its height. Above, the rock rose frowningly, at least five  hundred feet over our heads. Below, it fell perpendicularly down to the  beach. The roar of the sea did not reach us, at our dizzy height, and the  heavy surf-waves, in which no boat could live, seemed to kiss the shore as  gently as the ripple of a summer-lake. This was the most elevated point of  the road, which thence began to descend; but the downward track was as  steep and far more dangerous.

[Footnote 1: These words are crossed out.--ETIENNE.]    On ordinary subjects she would chatter vivaciously enough and she can  talk in a fascinating manner on every subject I care to bring up, but  as soon as I drew the conversation round to a personal line she  gradually became more silent and a far-away and distant look came into  those wonderful eyes.    I have found out nothing about her beyond the fact that she has  travelled all over Europe. I don't even know how old she is, but I  should guess twenty-six.    I tried to find out a few details by means of discreet remarks at the  Club and elsewhere.    She simply arrived here about a year ago--as a singer, and met the  Colonel--beyond that, all is mystery. Everything about her attracts me  powerfully, and this mystery adds subtleties to her charms.    This afternoon I went to say good-bye; I told her we were leaving  \"shortly,\" and she gently reproved me for disobeying the order which  forbids discussion of movements, but I could see she was not greatly  displeased.    After tea she played to me, music of the modern Russian  school--Arensky, Sibelius and Pilsuki; a storm was brewing and we both  felt sad.    She played for an hour or so, and then came and sat by me on a low  divan by the fire. We were silent for a long while in the gathering  gloom, whilst a thousand thoughts chased each other swiftly through my  brain, as I endeavoured to summon up courage to say what I had  determined I must say before I left her, perhaps for ever.    At last, when only her profile was visible against the glow of the  logs, I spoke.    I told her quietly, calmly and almost dispassionately that I had grown  to love her and that to me she was life itself. I told her that I had  tried not to speak until I could endure no longer.    She sat very still as I spoke, and when I had finished there was a long  silence and I gently stretched out my hand and stroked her lovely black  hair. At last she rose and with averted face walked across the room,  and stood looking at the storm through the big bow windows. I watched  her, but did not dare follow.    At length she returned to me, and I saw what I had instinctively known  the whole time--that she had been crying. I could not think why.    She put her arms round my neck, kissed me on the forehead and murmured,  \"Poor Karl.\"    I felt crushed; I dared not move for fear of breaking the magic of the  moment, yet I longed to know more; I felt overwhelmed by some colossal  mystery that seemed to be enveloping me in its folds. Why did she pity  me? Why did she weep? Why didn't she answer my avowal? Why didn't she  tell me something? Such were some of the problems that perplexed me.    It was thus when the clock chimed seven. I told her that my leave was  up at seven o'clock, and that at 7.15 I had to be back on board the  boat. She remembered this, and in an instant the past quarter of an  hour might never have existed. She was all agitation and nervousness  lest I should be late on board--though at the moment I would have  cheerfully missed the boat to hear her say she loved me.    I tried to protest, but in vain. With feminine quickness she utilized  the incident to avoid a situation she evidently found full of  difficulty, and at 7.10, with the memory of a light kiss on my lips and  her God-speed in my ears I was in a taxi driving to the docks in a  blinding rain-storm--and we sail to-night.    For five, six, seven, perhaps ten days at the least, and at the most  for ever, I am doomed to be away from her and without news of her. And  I don't even know whether she loves me!    I think I can say she cares for me up to a certain point, but I want  more.      \"Oh Zoe! of the violet eyes,    And hair of blackest night    Thy lips are brightest crimson,    Thy skin is dazzling white.      \"Oh! lay your head upon my breast,    And lift your lips to mine;    Then murmur in soft breathings,    Drink deep from what is thine.      \"Then let the war rage onward,    Let kingdoms rise and fall;    To each shall be the other,    Their life, their hope, their all.\"    [Footnote: I am indebted to Commander C. C. for the above rough  translation of Karl's effusion.--ETIENNE.]          _At sea._      We are bound for the same old spot as last time.    Alten must have been drinking like a fish lately; his breath smells  like a distillery; he is apparently partial to schnapps, which he gets  easily in Bruges.    I can't help admiring the man, as he is a rigid teetotaller at sea,  though he must find the strain well nigh intolerable, judging from the  condition he was in when he came on board last night. He was really  totally unfit to take charge of the boat, and I virtually took her down  the canal, though with sottish obstinacy he insisted on remaining on  the bridge.    This morning, though his complexion was a hideous yellow colour, he  seems quite all right. I shall play a little trick on him at dinner  to-night.    I have begun to get to know some of the crew by now; they are a fine  lot of youngsters with a seasoning of half a dozen older men. The  coxswain, Schmitt by name, is a splendid old petty officer who has been  in the U-boat service since 1911.    His favourite enjoyment is to spin yarns to the younger members of the  crew, who know of his weakness and play up to it.    He has a favourite expression which runs thus:    \"His Majesty the Kaiser said Germany's future lies on the sea; I say  Germany's future lies under the sea.\"    He is inordinately fond of this statement, and the youngsters  continually say: \"What made you take to U-boat work, Schmitt?\" and the  invariable reply is as above. When he has been asked the question about  half a dozen times in the course of a day, he is liable to become  suspicious, and if his questioner is within range Schmitt stares at him  for a few seconds in an absent-minded way, then an arm like that of a  gorilla shoots out, and the quizzer (_Untersucher_) receives a  resounding box on the ears to the huge delight of his companions. The  old man then permits his iron-lipped mouth to relax into a caustic  smile, after which he is left in peace for some time.    At the wheel he is an artist, for he seems to divine what the next  order is going to be, or if he is steering her on a course he predicts  the direction of the next wave even as a skilful chess player works out  the moves ahead.           *       *       *       *       *    I am rather weary and ought to go to bed, but before I lose the savour  I must record the splendid fun I had with Alten at dinner.    We were dining alone, as the navigator was on the bridge, and the  engineer was busy with a slight leak in the cooking water service. I  have said that, though a heavy drinker by nature, Alten is a strict  abstainer at sea. Accordingly I produced a small flask of rum, half-way  through dinner, and helped myself to a liberal tot, placing the liquor  between us on the table. As the sight met his eyes and the aroma  greeted his nostrils, a gleam of joy flashed across his face, to be  succeeded by a frown.    With an amiable smile I proffered the flask to him, remarking at the  same time: \"You don't drink at sea, do you?\"    In a thick voice he muttered, \"No! Yes--no! thank you.\"    With an air of having noticed nothing, I resumed my meal, but out of  the corner of my eye I watched his left hand on the table near the  flask. It was most interesting, all the veins stood out like ropes, and  his knuckles almost burst through the skin.    This went on for about thirty seconds, when he choked out something  about needing a breath of fresh air. As he got up his face was brick  red, and I almost thought he'd have a fit.    Whether by accident or design he pulled the cloth as he got out from  between the settee and the table and upset the flask.    He was apparently incapable of apologizing, for he rushed up on deck.    A few minutes later the navigating officer came down and asked what was  up?    I said: \"What do you mean?\"    He said: \"Well, the Captain came up just now, swearing like a trooper,  and told me to get to the devil out of it; it didn't seem advisable to  question him, so I got out of it and came down.\"    I expressed my opinion that the Captain must be feeling sea-sick and  was ashamed to say so. I also suggested to the navigator that he should  take the Captain a little brandy in case he was not feeling well, but  the navigator declared he was going to stay down in the warmth till he  was sent for. Alten is a great coarse brute. Fancy allowing a material  substance such as alcohol to grip one's mentality.    Thank Heaven I have nerves of iron; nothing would affect me!    And now to bed, though I must just read my account of our day in the  forest. Darling girl, may I dream of thee.           *       *       *       *       *    We laid our mines without trouble at 5 a.m. this morning, though at  midnight we had a most unpleasant experience.    I was asleep, as it was my morning watch, when I was awakened by the  harsh rattle of the diving alarms.    The Diesel subsided with a few spasmodic coughs into silence, and as I  jumped out of my bunk and groped for my short sea boots, the navigator  and helmsman came tumbling down the conning tower, with the navigator  shouting, \"Take her down,\" as hard as you like.    The men at the planes had them \"hard-to-dive\" in an instant.    The vents had been opened as the hooters sounded, and Alten, who had  jumped into the control room, immediately rang down, \"All out on the  electric motors.\"    In thirty seconds from the original alarm we were at an angle of twenty  degrees down by the bow, and I had sat down heavily on the battery  boards, completely surprised by the sudden tilt of the deck.    It occurred to me that the air was escaping through the vents with a  strangely loud noise, but before I could consider the matter further or  even inquire the reason for this sudden dive, the"]]]
