The sons and daughters tended him like  a baby and loved him with gentle, tender respect. There was no  embarrassment for his loss of mind, no thought of being distressed  or pained by it, and because his children took their father's state  so quietly and without shame, every guest who came took it in the  same way, and there was no thought of keeping the father out of  sight. He sat in the living-room in his comfortable chair, and  always one child or another was sitting right beside him with a  smiling face. Instead of being a trying member of the family, as  happens in so many cases, this old father seemed to bring content  and rest to his children through their loving care for him.    Very often--I might almost say always--the trying member of the  family is trying only because we make her so by our attitude toward  her, let her be grandmother, mother, or maiden aunt. Even the  proverbial mother-in-law grows less difficult as our attitude toward  her is relieved of the strain of detesting everything she does, and  expecting to detest everything that she is going to do. With every  trying friend we have, if we yield to him in all minor matters we  find the settling of essential questions wonderfully less difficult.    A son had a temper and the girl he married had a temper. The mother  loved her son with the selfish love with which so many mothers  burden their children, and thought that he alone of all men had a  right to lose his temper. Consequently she excused her son and  blamed her daughter-in-law. If there were a mild cyclone roused  between the two married people the son would turn to his mother to  hear what a martyr he was and what misfortune he had to bear in  having been so easily mistaken in the woman he married. Thus the  mother-in-law, who felt that she was protecting her poor son, was  really breeding dissension between two people who could have been  the best possible friends all their lives.    The young wife very soon became ashamed of her temper and worked  until she conquered it, but it was not until her mother-in-law had  been out of this world for years that her husband discovered what he  had lost in turning away from his wife's friendship, and it was only  by the happy accident of severe illness that he ever discovered his  mistake at all, and gained freedom from the bondage of his own  temper enough to appreciate his wife.    If, however, the wife had yielded in the beginning not only to her  husband's bad temper but also to the antagonism of her  mother-in-law, which was, of course, annoying in many petty ways,  she might have gained her husband's friendship, and it is possible  that she might, moreover, have gained the friendship of her  mother-in-law.    The best rule with regard to all trying members of the family is to  yield to them always in non-essentials; and when you disagree in  essentials stick to the principle which you believe to be right, but  stick to it without resistance. Believe your way, but make yourself  willing that the trying member should believe her way. Make an  opportunity of what appears to be a limitation, and, believe me,  your trying member can become a blessing to you.    I go further than that--I truly believe that to make the best of  life every family should have a trying member. When we have no  trying member of our family, and life goes along smoothly, as a  matter of course, the harmony is very liable to be spurious, and a  sudden test will all at once knock such a family into discord, much  to the surprise of every member. When we go through discord to  harmony, and once get into step, we are very likely to keep in step:    Be willing, then, make yourself willing, that the trying member  should be in the way. Hope that she will stay in your family until  you have succeeded in dropping not only all resistance to her being  there, but every resistance to her various ways in detail. Bring her  annoying ways up to your mind voluntarily when you are away from  her. If you do that you will find all the resistances come with them  and you can relax out of the strain then and there. You will find  that when you get home or come down to breakfast in the morning (for  many resistances are voluntarily thrown off in the night) you will  have a pleasanter feeling toward the trying member, and it comes so  spontaneously that you will be surprised yourself at the absence of  the strain of resistance in you.    Believe me when I say this: the yielding in the non-essentials,  singularly enough, gives one strength to refuse to yield in  principles. But we must always remember that if we want to find real  peace, while we refuse to yield in our own principles so long as we  believe them to be true, we must be entirely willing that others  should differ from us in belief.          CHAPTER VI    _Irritable Husbands_      SUPPOSE your husband got impatient and annoyed with you because you  did not seem to enter heartily into the interests of his work and  sympathize with its cares and responsibilities and soothe him out of  the nervous harassments. Would you not perhaps feel a little sore  that he seemed to expect all from you and to give nothing in return?  I know how many women will say that is all very well, but the  husband and father should feel as much interest in the home and the  children as the wife and mother does. That is, of course, true up to  a certain point, always in general, and when his help is really  necessary in particular. But a man cannot enter into the details of  his wife's duties at home any more than a woman can enter into the  details of her husband's duties at his office.    Then, again, my readers may say: \"But a woman's nervous system is  more sensitive than a man's; she needs help and consolation. She  needs to have some one on whom she can lean.\" Now the answer to that  will probably be surprising, but an intelligent understanding and  comprehension of it would make a very radical difference in the  lives of many men and women who have agreed to live together for  life--for better and for worse.    Now the truth is man's nervous system is quite as sensitive as a  woman's, but the woman's temptation to emotion makes her appear more  sensitive, and her failure to control her emotions ultimately  increases the sensitiveness of her nerves so that they are more  abnormal than her husband's. Even that is not always true The other  day a woman sat in tears and distress telling of the hardness of  heart, the restlessness, the irritability, the thoughtlessness, the  unkindness of her husband. Her face was drawn with suffering. She  insisted that she was not complaining, that it was her deep and  tender love for her husband that made her suffer so. \"But it is  killing me, it is killing me,\" she said, and one who saw her could  well believe it. And if the distress and the great strain upon her  nerves had kept on it certainly would have made her ill, if not have  actually ended her life with a nervous collapse.    The friend in whom she confided sat quietly and heard her through.  She let her pour herself out to the very finish until she stopped  because there was nothing more to say. Then, by means of a series of  gentle, well-adapted questions, she drew from the wife a  recognition--for the first time--of the fact that she really did  nothing whatever for her husband and expected him to do everything  for her. Perhaps she put on a pretty dress for him in order to look  attractive when he came home, but if he did not notice how well she  looked, and was irritable about something in the house, she would be  dissolved in tears because she had not proved attractive and pleased  him. Maybe she had tried to have a dinner that he especially liked;  then if he did not notice the food, and seemed distracted about  something that was worrying him, she would again be dissolved in  tears because he \"appreciated nothing that she tried to do for him.\"    Now it is perfectly true that this husband was irritable and brutal;  he had no more consideration for his wife than he had for any one  else. But his wife was doing all in her power to fan his  irritability into flame and to increase his brutality. She was  attitudinizing in her own mind as a martyr. She was demanding  kindness and attention and sympathy from her husband, and because  she demanded it she never got it.    A woman can demand without demanding imperiously. There is more  selfish demanding in a woman's emotional suffering because her  husband does not do this or that or the other for her sake than  there is in a tornado of man's irritability or anger. You see, a  woman's demanding spirit is covered with the mush of her emotions. A  man's demanding spirit stands out in all its naked ugliness. One is  just as bad as the other. One is just as repulsive as the other.    It is a radical, practical impossibility to bring loving-kindness  out of any one by demanding it. Loving-kindness, thoughtfulness, and  consideration have got to be born spontaneously in a man's own mind  to be anything at all, and no amount of demanding on the part of his  wife can force it.    When this little lady of whom I have been writing found that she had  been demanding from her husband what he really ought to have given  her as a matter of course, and that she had used up all her strength  in suffering because he did not give it, and had used none of her  strength in the effort to be patient and quiet in waiting for him to  come to his senses, she went home and began a new life. She was a  plucky little woman and very intelligent when once her eyes were  opened. She recognized the fact that her suffering was resistance to  her husband's irritable selfishness, and she stopped resisting.    It was a long and hard struggle of days, weeks, and months, but it  brought a very happy reward. When a man is irritable and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#7)"],[1,"house-sparrows if I did not mention how faithfully each of them shares  any food it discovers with all members of the society to which it  belongs. The fact was known to the Greeks, and it has been transmitted  to posterity how a Greek orator once exclaimed (I quote from  memory):--\"While I am speaking to you a sparrow has come to tell to  other sparrows that a slave has dropped on the floor a sack of corn, and  they all go there to feed upon the grain.\" The more, one is pleased to  find this observation of old confirmed in a recent little book by Mr.  Gurney, who does not doubt that the house sparrows always inform each  other as to where there is some food to steal; he says, \"When a stack  has been thrashed ever so far from the yard, the sparrows in the yard  have always had their crops full of the grain.\"(17) True, the sparrows  are extremely particular in keeping their domains free from the  invasions of strangers; thus the sparrows of the Jardin du Luxembourg  bitterly fight all other sparrows which may attempt to enjoy their turn  of the garden and its visitors; but within their own communities they  fully practise mutual support, though occasionally there will be of  course some quarrelling even amongst the best friends.    Hunting and feeding in common is so much the habit in the feathered  world that more quotations hardly would be needful: it must be  considered as an established fact. As to the force derived from such  associations, it is self-evident. The strongest birds of prey are  powerless in face of the associations of our smallest bird pets. Even  eagles--even the powerful and terrible booted eagle, and the martial  eagle, which is strong enough to carry away a hare or a young antelope  in its claws--are compelled to abandon their prey to bands of those  beggars the kites, which give the eagle a regular chase as soon as they  see it in possession of a good prey. The kites will also give chase to  the swift fishing-hawk, and rob it of the fish it has captured; but no  one ever saw the kites fighting together for the possession of the prey  so stolen. On the Kerguelen Island, Dr. Coues saw the gulls to  Buphogus--the sea-hen of the sealers--pursue make them disgorge their  food, while, on the other side, the gulls and the terns combined to  drive away the sea-hen as soon as it came near to their abodes,  especially at nesting-time.(18) The little, but extremely swift lapwings  (Vanellus cristatus) boldly attack the birds of prey. \"To see them  attacking a buzzard, a kite, a crow, or an eagle, is one of the most  amusing spectacles. One feels that they are sure of victory, and one  sees the anger of the bird of prey. In such circumstances they perfectly  support one another, and their courage grows with their numbers.\"(19)  The lapwing has well merited the name of a \"good mother\" which the  Greeks gave to it, for it never fails to protect other aquatic birds  from the attacks of their enemies. But even the little white wagtails  (Motacilla alba), whom we well know in our gardens and whose whole  length hardly attains eight inches, compel the sparrow-hawk to abandon  its hunt. \"I often admired their courage and agility,\" the old Brehm  wrote, \"and I am persuaded that the falcon alone is capable of capturing  any of them.... When a band of wagtails has compelled a bird of prey to  retreat, they make the air resound with their triumphant cries, and  after that they separate.\" They thus come together for the special  purpose of giving chase to their enemy, just as we see it when the whole  bird-population of a forest has been raised by the news that a nocturnal  bird has made its appearance during the day, and all together--birds of  prey and small inoffensive singers--set to chase the stranger and make  it return to its concealment.    What an immense difference between the force of a kite, a buzzard or a  hawk, and such small birds as the meadow-wagtail; and yet these little  birds, by their common action and courage, prove superior to the  powerfully-winged and armed robbers! In Europe, the wagtails not only  chase the birds of prey which might be dangerous to them, but they chase  also the fishing-hawk \"rather for fun than for doing it any harm;\" while  in India, according to Dr. Jerdon's testimony, the jackdaws chase the  gowinda-kite \"for simple matter of amusement.\" Prince Wied saw the  Brazilian eagle urubitinga surrounded by numberless flocks of toucans  and cassiques (a bird nearly akin to our rook), which mocked it. \"The  eagle,\" he adds, \"usually supports these insults very quietly, but from  time to time it will catch one of these mockers.\" In all such cases the  little birds, though very much inferior in force to the bird of prey,  prove superior to it by their common action.(20)    However, the most striking effects of common life for the security of  the individual, for its enjoyment of life, and for the development of  its intellectual capacities, are seen in two great families of birds,  the cranes and the parrots. The cranes are extremely sociable and live  in most excellent relations, not only with their congeners, but also  with most aquatic birds. Their prudence is really astonishing, so also  their intelligence; they grasp the new conditions in a moment, and act  accordingly. Their sentries always keep watch around a flock which is  feeding or resting, and the hunters know well how difficult it is to  approach them. If man has succeeded in surprising them, they will never  return to the same place without having sent out one single scout first,  and a party of scouts afterwards; and when the reconnoitring party  returns and reports that there is no danger, a second group of scouts is  sent out to verify the first report, before the whole band moves. With  kindred species the cranes contract real friendship; and in captivity  there is no bird, save the also sociable and highly intelligent parrot,  which enters into such real friendship with man. \"It sees in man, not a  master, but a friend, and endeavours to manifest it,\" Brehm concludes  from a wide personal experience. The crane is in continual activity from  early in the morning till late in the night; but it gives a few hours  only in the morning to the task of searching its food, chiefly  vegetable. All the remainder of the day is given to society life. \"It  picks up small pieces of wood or small stones, throws them in the air  and tries to catch them; it bends its neck, opens its wings, dances,  jumps, runs about, and tries to manifest by all means its good  disposition of mind, and always it remains graceful and beautiful.\"(21)  As it lives in society it has almost no enemies, and though Brehm  occasionally saw one of them captured by a crocodile, he wrote that  except the crocodile he knew no enemies of the crane. It eschews all of  them by its proverbial prudence; and it attains, as a rule, a very old  age. No wonder that for the maintenance of the species the crane need  not rear a numerous offspring; it usually hatches but two eggs. As to  its superior intelligence, it is sufficient to say that all observers  are unanimous in recognizing that its intellectual capacities remind one  very much of those of man.    The other extremely sociable bird, the parrot, stands, as known, at the  very top of the whole feathered world for the development of its  intelligence. Brehm has so admirably summed up the manners of life of  the parrot, that I cannot do better than translate the following  sentence:--    \"Except in the pairing season, they live in very numerous societies or  bands. They choose a place in the forest to stay there, and thence they  start every morning for their hunting expeditions. The members of each  band remain faithfully attached to each other, and they share in common  good or bad luck. All together they repair in the morning to a field, or  to a garden, or to a tree, to feed upon fruits. They post sentries to  keep watch over the safety of the whole band, and are attentive to their  warnings. In case of danger, all take to flight, mutually supporting  each other, and all simultaneously return to their resting-place. In a  word, they always live closely united.\"    They enjoy society of other birds as well. In India, the jays and crows  come together from many miles round, to spend the night in company with  the parrots in the bamboo thickets. When the parrots start hunting, they  display the most wonderful intelligence, prudence, and capacity of  coping with circumstances. Take, for instance, a band of white cacadoos  in Australia. Before starting to plunder a corn-field, they first send  out a reconnoitring party which occupies the highest trees in the  vicinity of the field, while other scouts perch upon the intermediate  trees between the field and the forest and transmit the signals. If the  report runs \"All right,\" a score of cacadoos will separate from the bulk  of the band, take a flight in the air, and then fly towards the trees  nearest to the field. They also will scrutinize the neighbourhood for a  long while, and only then will they give the signal for general advance,  after which the whole band starts at once and plunders the field in no  time. The Australian settlers have the greatest difficulties in  beguiling the prudence of the parrots; but if man, with all his art and  weapons, has succeeded in killing some of them, the cacadoos become so  prudent and watchful that they henceforward baffle all stratagems.(22)    There can be no doubt that it is the practice of life in society which  enables the parrots to attain that very high level of almost human  intelligence and almost human feelings which we know in them. Their high  intelligence has induced the best naturalists to describe some species,  namely the grey parrot, as the \"birdman.\" As to their mutual attachment  it is known that when a parrot has been killed by a hunter, the others  fly over the corpse of their comrade"]]]
