[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#7)"],[1,"were occupied by  the presiding officers who directed the services. Thus four separate  meetings were in session at the same time, without, in the least,  interfering with each other--giving opportunity for four to exercise  instead of one.    On the aforementioned days, Father Smith (the Prophet's father) was in  the habit of entering the Temple very early in the morning, and there  offering up his prayers to God, in that holy place, before the rising  of the sun, after having told the Saints, publicly, that they were  welcome to come as early as they pleased. The result was that many  assembled before the hour of 10 a.m., and did not leave till after 4  p.m.    Father Smith, in the capacity of his calling as President, gave general  counsel and instructions on fast day; recommending that the greater  portion of the forenoon should be spent in prayer, with testimonies  of manifestations of the power of God, and with exhortations to  faithfulness. At about 3 p.m. he would order the curtains to be drawn  up--bringing the four congregations into one, over which he then  presided until the close of the meeting.    The Saints were humble, and through our united faith, the Spirit of God  was poured out in copious effusion, and, for one hour, we enjoyed  pentecostal refreshings from on high. On these occasions the gifts of  the Gospel were powerfully manifest--speaking and singing in tongues,  the interpretation of tongues, the gift of healing and of prophecy,  were freely exercised. These monthly fast meetings were so interesting,  and so very enjoyable, that people came long distances to attend them.    At one of these meetings, an insane woman came into the quarter of  the house where I had convened; she came before the opening services,  and her tongue ran incessantly, making so much confusion as to  render it improper, if not impossible, for the presiding Elder to  commence religious services. The more she was coaxed and supplicated  to be silent the more impetuous she became. At length, Elder John P.  Greene, who was appointed to preside in that department, requested the  congregation to kneel down and all simultaneously pray to God, vocally,  that the evil spirit which was actuating that woman might be bound.  The request was immediately complied with, and when we arose from our  kneeling position Brother Greene, addressing the unfortunate woman  (who was then silent), said: \"Sister, you may now speak, for thou wilt  not speak unless thou shalt speak by the Spirit of God.\" She instantly  arose to her feet, and, in a sputtering, stammering manner, tried to  speak but could not, and flew out of the Temple like a dart, and we saw  no more of her that day.    I will relate one more remarkable circumstance which transpired in  that interesting season--a circumstance which was not confined to  either section of the Temple, but was witnessed by the many who were  congregated on that day; and certainly all now living who were present  on that occasion will remember. It is a testimony of answer to prayer  that never can be forgotten. Father Smith presided over the meeting in  the northwest section of the Temple, and after the meeting was opened  by singing, he was mouth in prayer, and in course of supplication he  very earnestly prayed that the Spirit of God might be poured out  as on the day of Pentecost--that it might come \"as a rushing mighty  wind.\" Some time after, in the midst of the exercises of the forenoon,  it did come; and whether Father Smith had forgotten what he had prayed  for, or whether in the fervency of his heart, when praying he did not  realize what he prayed for, I never ascertained; but when the sound  came and filled the house, with an expression of great astonishment  he raised his eyes, exclaiming, \"What! Is the house on fire?\" But  presently he comprehended the cause of his alarm, and was filled with  unspeakable joy.    In attending these meetings, and listening to the young Elders as they  bore testimonies of their marvelous experiences in the work of God, my  brother became inspired with a strong desire to engage at once in the  labors of the ministry. On this subject he says:    The testimonies of young missionaries as they rehearsed their  experiences as laborers in the vineyard, proclaiming the joyful news  that God was again speaking to His children on the earth; that He had  raised up a Prophet through whom He was communicating His will, and  calling on all the inhabitants of the earth to \"repent, for the kingdom  of heaven is at hand,\" stirred within me an irresistible desire to join  in the glorious enterprise.    About this time a proclamation of the First Presidency was given  from the stand, inviting those who wished to become members of the  Elders' Quorum to present their names, and if accounted worthy by the  Presidency, they should be ordained. With many others, I submitted my  name for approval or otherwise, which is the only time in my life that  I have offered my name for or solicited an office or calling.        Chapter III.    My Brother started on Mission.--Without Purse or Scrip.--Hard  work to Beg.--Affectionate Aunt.--First Meeting in Medina County,  Ohio.--Baptisms.--Preaches in Court House.--Ludicrous Anecdote.--Visits  Relatives.--Preaches to Schoolmates.--Baptizes some of them.    A short time after my ordination and reception into the Elders' quorum,  _i. e_., early in the spring of 1837, I shouldered my valise and  started out like the ancient missionaries, \"without purse or scrip,\"  on foot and alone, to proclaim the restoration of the fulness of the  Gospel of the Son of God, and to bear witness of what I had seen and  heard, and of the knowledge I had received by the inspiration of the  Holy Ghost.    It was, however, a severe trial to my natural feelings of independence  to go without purse or scrip--especially the purse; for, from the  time I was old enough to work, the feeling that I \"paid my way\"  always seemed a necessary adjunct to self respect, and nothing but a  positive knowledge that God required it now, as He did anciently of His  servants, the Disciples of Jesus, could induce me to go forth dependent  on my fellow creatures for the common necessaries of life. But my duty  in this respect was clearly made known to me, and I determined to do it.    I walked upwards of twenty miles the first day, and stayed over night  with Mrs. Granger, my father's sister. She was a devoted Presbyterian,  and a noble hearted woman; she thought very highly of my father's  family, and that there must be something valuable in \"Mormonism\" or  they would not have embraced it. She held me in so great esteem that  she could not believe that I would suffer the same abuse, be maltreated  and refused accommodation as other \"Mormon\" Elders. I differed in  opinion, and told her I thought I need not expect to travel a smoother  path than my brethren. The following morning I left my aunt and her  hospitable roof, and traveled about thirty miles, and just as the sun  was setting I made my first call for a night's lodging, as a \"Mormon\"  Elder, and was refused; then another, and so on, until the eighth call,  when I was admitted to a night's lodging--going to bed supperless, and  leaving in the morning, minus a breakfast.    The first meeting I held was in the neighborhood of my uncle, by the  name of Goddard, near the county seat of Medina County, Ohio. The  people were notified and a respectable congregation assembled. It was  a sore trial to face that audience in the capacity of a preacher, but  I believed and felt an assurance that a Spirit of inspiration would  prompt and give me utterance. I had sought by prayer and fasting--I  had humbled myself before the Lord, calling on Him in mighty prayer to  impart the power and inspiration of the holy Priesthood; and when I  stood before that congregation, although I knew not one word I could  say, as soon as I opened my mouth to speak, the Holy Ghost rested  mightily upon me, filling my mind with light and communicating ideas  and proper language by which to impart them. The people were astonished  and requested another meeting.    After the second meeting the court house was offered me, which I  accepted, and had a very interesting time, and was treated very  courteously by several of the officials. I baptized and confirmed into  the Church my uncle, aunt and several of my cousins, of whom Adaline  was one, who afterwards became my wife.    I traveled and preached during the following summer and autumn, in  different parts of Ohio, baptizing quite a number--always traveling  on foot, \"without purse or scrip,\" and often meeting with trying and  sometimes amusing circumstances.    When at the house of Brother Smith, in Stark County, Ohio, I  dreamed one night that arrangements were in progress to mob me. The  following evening after I had the dream, as I sat conversing with  friends who had called on me, a loud rap at the door preceded the  entrance of two well dressed young men, who politely invited me to  accompany them to a school house about one mile distant, and address an  audience already assembled. After a little hesitation on my part, they  began to urgently request my acceptance of their invitation, when the  dream of the preceding night instantaneously flashed across my mind,  and I told them that I could not comply with their wishes. They still  persisted to urge and insist on my accompanying them. When they were  convinced that I was immovable in my determination of non-compliance,  they not only manifested disappointment, but were exceedingly angry.    The next day I learned that they told the truth so far as a congregated  audience waiting my appearance at the school house was concerned, but  the object was entirely different from that reported by the young  men--it corresponded precisely with my dream.    On one occasion (having been joined by Brother A. Butterfield) I called  at a hotel for our night's lodging, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#7)"],[1," of absolute unselfishness.  Not only is it to be found in the words of our books, but a like  testimony is written in the works of the Latter-day Saints--in their  actions. Everywhere unselfishness abounds in the Church of Christ,  both in theory and practice. Now, if we can only get the people of the  world to understand this fact of unselfishness--this very genius of  Mormonism--if they could be made to know that Mormonism is here to do  good, to raise mankind from the low levels on which men are content  to walk to the higher planes where God would have them walk, that  they might have sweet fellowship with God, much of our difficulty in  preaching the gospel would disappear. May the Lord hasten the day when  the world shall know the Saints and the work of God better.        III.    SOME RECENT LITERATURE ON MORMONISM.    FOREWORD.    The following brief discussion of Mr. I. Woodbridge Riley's work, is  an address delivered at the Seventy-fourth Semi-Annual Conference of  the Church, held in Salt Lake City, Oct. 5, 1903. Mr. Riley's book of  446 pages is a well written thesis on the \"Founder of Mormonism,\" and  was published in 1902. It is a psychological study of Joseph Smith the  Prophet. The purpose of the work is set forth in the author's preface,  as follows:        \"The aim of this work is to examine Joseph Smith's character and      achievements from the standpoint of recent psychology. Sectarians      and phrenologists, spiritualists and mesmerists have variously      interpreted his more or less abnormal performances,--it remains for      the psychologist to have a try at them.\"    The work also has an introductory preface by Professor George Trumbull  Ladd, of Yale University, in which Mr. Riley's essay is very highly  praised. Indeed, the work was offered to the Philosophical Faculty of  Yale University as a thesis for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and  before this the matter of the essay had been utilized in 1898 for a  Master of Arts thesis, under the title of \"Metaphysics of Mormonism,\"  so that from these circumstances we may venture the remark that Mr.  Riley's book is of a highly scientific character, at least in its  literary structure, and has already attracted some considerable notice  in the world.    I.    \"THE FOUNDER OF MORMONISM.\"    Some of you perhaps are aware of the fact that I have been giving some  attention of late to the literature on Mormonism; not only that which  we ourselves publish, but that also which is Published by others. The  publications on Mormonism during the last five years, I believe, are  more numerous than in any twenty years previous to that time. The last  five years have witnessed an awakening of thought upon our religion.  More, and ever more attention is being given to it. More newspaper  articles, more magazine articles, more volumes--some of them quite  pretentious--have been written on Mormonism than ever before, and  indicate the universal interest taken in the subject. The books and  magazine articles have been written from various standpoints, some of  them in the old spirit of bitterness, and some of them are intended  to be written in a spirit of fairness. Yet I marvel at their author's  ideas of fairness. One work, written by a noted professor, pretending  to be an impartial history, and issued by one of the first publishing  houses in the United States, with the view, evidently, of establishing  a standard history of Mormonism, gives full credence to everything  that has been said against us, but the author frequently cautions his  readers against quotations he makes from our own works--and yet that  book is put forth as an impartial history of Mormonism! Some have  attempted to write from a philosophical standpoint, but with the result  that they plainly manifest that they have not yet reached foundation  principles upon which they can satisfactorily account for Joseph  Smith, the Prophet, and the great work he accomplished. When I see  men shifting their grounds, and advancing first one theory and then,  another to account for Mormonism, and there is confusion among them,  uncertainty, indecision--I know that the citadel of our mighty faith  is secure from harm from their attacks; that Mormonism cannot fall a  victim to their philosophies or their arguments.    Let me, for a little while, draw your attention to at least one of  the so-called philosophical solutions of Mormonism, a scientific  accounting for Joseph Smith. The work I allude to was offered to Yale  University as a thesis upon which the author hoped to secure, and I  think he did secure, the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy. He candidly  confesses that it is an effort to account for Joseph Smith upon some  other hypothesis than that he was a conscious fraud, bent on deceiving  mankind. When an intelligent man makes such an announcement as that, I  know, and you know, that the theories heretofore advanced to account  for Joseph Smith, are unsatisfactory; that they are efforts which  have failed. The theory that Joseph Smith was a conscious fraud, an  imposter, has fallen to the ground. The charges frequently made and  persistently urged that Mormonism had its origin in deception and  conscious fraud have failed of their purpose. The floods of falsehood  with which some men have sought to overwhelm Mormonism have not  accomplished the end proposed. The Latter-day Saints, after more than  three-quarters of a century of existence, stand above all the floods  of falsehood that have been belched out against them. The work of God  has not broken down, it has survived; and the Saints smilingly pity  those who would make use of such contemptible means with which to  combat the truth of Almighty God. Now, however, we are to be treated  philosophically. And the philosophy that is advanced is, unconscious  hallucination in the mind of Joseph Smith; partly unconscious and  partly conscious possession of hypnotic power, by which the minds of  those around him were dominated and made to see things which in reality  had no existence; and while the Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, and  others testify of visions and voices from God honestly enough, still as  a matter of fact those revelations had really no objective existence,  but were mental hallucinations. And as for Joseph Smith, he was  deceived by epileptic conditions.    The author I am considering is at great pains to trace the ancestry  of the Prophet, pointing out their mental peculiarities and supposed  defects, leading up to the conclusion that these defects of mind in  his ancestors culminated in epilepsy in Joseph Smith. And hence, we  have as the explanation of Mormonism, epileptic fits in its Prophet,  whose hallucinations are honestly mistaken for inspired visions, with  partly conscious and partly unconscious hypnotic power over others! And  this theory is presented seriously to one of the first institutions of  learning in America as a rational explanation of how Mormonism came  into existence!    Ernest Renan, the French philosopher, when considering a similar  hypothesis to account for the Lord Jesus Christ, overthrew all that  kind of sophistry with this simple statement:        \"It has never been given to the mere aberrations of the human mind      to result in the establishment of permanent institutions that      influence any considerable number of people.\"    In other words, the dreams and hallucinations of the epileptic end  in mere dreams and hallucinations; they never crystallize into great  systems of philosophy or into rational religious institutions. They  never crystallize into great organizations capable of perpetuating that  philosophy and that religion in the world. No matter how nearly genius  may be allied to madness, it must remain genius and not degenerate to  madness if it exercises any permanent influence over the minds of men.    It is a pleasure to find one's conclusions sustained by men of  recognized ability in any line of work on which they have specialized,  and in respect of which they are regarded as authorities. In such  manner I find the views, above set forth sustained by one eminent in  the domain of nervous diseases and psychiatry, Charles L. Dana, the  writer of text books on the foregoing subject, text books used in all  the great colleges and universities of our country, that give attention  to the subject. Following is his definition of paranoia, a disease  closely allied to that to which Mr. Riley assumes Joseph Smith was  subject. [A]    [Footnote A: This paragraph and the two quotations following have been  added since the above remarks were published as part of the proceedings  of the conference.]        \"Paranoia is a chronic psychosis characterized by the development      gradually and soon after maturity of systematized delusions      without other serious disturbances of the mind, and without much      tendency to dementia. * * * With some the systematized idea takes a      religious turn, and the patient thinks he has some divine mission      or has received some inspiration from God; or the idea may take      a devotional turn and the patient become an acetic. It is not,      however, to be assumed that all promoters of new religions and      novel social ideas are paranoiacs. Many of these are simply the      natural developments, ignorance and a somewhat emotional and      unbalanced temperament. The characteristic of the paranoiac is that      his work is ineffective, his influence brief and trivial, his      ideas really too absurd and impractical for even ignorant men to      receive. I do not class successful prophets and organizers like      Joseph Smith, or great apostles of social reforms like Rousseau as      paranoiacs. Insane minds are not creative, but are weak, and lack      persistence in purpose or powers of execution.\" [A]    [Footnote A: Chas. Loomis Dana, Text Book of Nervous Diseases and  Psychiatry, 6th Edition, pp. 649-50.]        \"A certain rather "]]]
