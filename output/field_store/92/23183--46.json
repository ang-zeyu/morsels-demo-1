The balmy spirit of the western gale    Eternal breathes on fruits untaught to fail;    Each dropping pear a following pear supplies;    On apples apples, figs on figs arise:    The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,    The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow.      Here ordered vines in equal ranks appear,    With all the united labors of the year;    Some to unload the fertile branches run,    Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun,    Others to tread the liquid harvest join,    The groaning presses foam with floods of wine.    Here are the vines in early flower descried,    Here grapes discolored on the sunny side,    And there in Autumn's richest purple dyed.    Beds of all various herbs, forever green,    In beauteous order terminate the scene.      Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crowned:    This through the garden leads its streams around,    Visits each plant, and waters all the ground;    While that in pipes beneath the palace flows,    And thence its current on the town bestows.    To various use their various streams they bring;    The people one, and one supplies the king.      --Odyssey, B. VII. POPE'S Trans.          CHAPTER II.    THE FABULOUS AND LEGENDARY PERIOD OF GRECIAN HISTORY.    I. GRECIAN MYTHOLOGY.    As the Greeks, in common with the Egyptians and other Eastern  nations, placed the reign of the gods anterior to the race of  mortals, Grecian mythology--which is a system of myths, or fabulous  opinions and doctrines respecting the universe and the deities  who were supposed to preside over it--forms the most natural and  appropriate introduction to Grecian history.    Our principal knowledge of this system is derived from the works  of Homer, He'si-od, and other ancient writers, who have gathered  the floating legends of which it consists into tales and epic  poems, many of them of great power and beauty. Some of these legends  are exceedingly natural and pleasing, while others shock and disgust  us by the gross impossibilities and hideous deformities which they  reveal. Yet these legends are the spontaneous and the earliest  growth of the Grecian mind, and were long accepted by the people  as serious realities. They are, therefore, to be viewed as exponents  of early Grecian philosophy,--of all that the early Greeks believed,  and felt, and conjectured, respecting the universe and its government,  and respecting the social relations, duties, and destiny of  mankind,--and their influence upon national character was great.  As a Scotch poet and scholar of our own day well remarks,      Old fables these, and fancies old!      But not with hasty pride    Let logic cold and reason bold      Cast these old dreams aside.    Dreams are not false in all their scope:      Oft from the sleepy lair    Start giant shapes of fear and hope      That, aptly read, declare    Our deepest nature. God in dreams      Hath spoken to the wise;    And in a people's mythic themes      A people's wisdom lies.      --J. STUART BLACKIE.    According to Grecian philosophy, first in the order of time came  Cha'os, a heterogeneous mass, containing all the seeds of nature.  This was formed by the hand of an unknown god, into \"broad-breasted  Earth\" (the mother of the gods), who produced U'ranus, or Heaven.  Then Earth married Uranus, or Heaven; and from this union came a  numerous and powerful brood--the Ti'tans, and the Cyclo'pes, and  the gods of the wintry season Kot'-tos, Bria're-us, and Gy'ges,  who had each a hundred hands), supposed to be personifications  of the hail, the rain, and the snow.    The Titans made war upon their father, Uranus, who was wounded  by Chro'nos, or Saturn, the youngest and bravest of his sons.  From the drops of blood which flowed from the wound and fell upon  the earth sprung the Furies, the Giants, and the Me'lian nymphs;  and from those which fell into the sea sprang Venus, the goddess  of love and beauty. Uranus being dethroned, Saturn was permitted  by his brethren to reign, on condition that he would destroy all  his male children. But Rhe'a (his wife), unwilling to see her  children perish, concealed from him the birth of Zeus' (or Jupiter),  Pos-ei'don (or Neptune), and Pluto.      THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS.    The Titans, informed that Saturn had saved his children, made war  upon him and dethroned him; but he was soon restored by his son  Jupiter. Yet Jupiter soon afterward conspired against his father,  and after a long war with him and his giant progeny, that lasted  full ten years, he drove Saturn from the kingdom, which he held  against the repeated assaults of all the gods, who were finally  destroyed or imprisoned by his overmastering power. This contest  is termed \"the Battle of the Giants,\" and is very celebrated in  Grecian mythology. The description of it which HESIOD has given  in his Theogony is considered \"one of the most sublime passages  in classical poetry, conceived with great boldness, and executed  with a power and force which show a masterly though rugged genius.  It will bear a favorable comparison with Milton's 'Battle of the  Angels,' in Paradise Lost.\" We subjoin the following extracts from  it:      The immeasurable sea tremendous dashed    With roaring, earth resounded, the broad heaven    Groaned, shattering; huge Olympus reeled throughout,    Down to its rooted base, beneath the rush    Of those immortals. The dark chasm of hell    Was shaken with the trembling, with the tramp    Of hollow footsteps and strong battle-strokes,    And measureless uproar of wild pursuit.    So they against each other through the air    Hurled intermixed their weapons, scattering groans    Where'er they fell.                            The voice of armies rose    With rallying shout through the starred firmament,    And with a mighty war-cry both the hosts    Encountering closed. Nor longer then did Jove    Curb down his force, but sudden in his soul    There grew dilated strength, and it was filled    With his omnipotence; his whole of might    Broke from him, and the godhead rushed abroad.    The vaulted sky, the Mount Olympus, flashed    With his continual presence, for he passed    Incessant forth, and lightened where he trod.      Thrown from his nervous grasp the lightnings flew,    Reiterated swift; the whirling flash,    Cast sacred splendor, and the thunder-bolt    Fell. Then on every side the foodful earth    Roared in the burning flame, and far and near    The trackless depth of forests crashed with fire;    Yea, the broad earth burned red, the floods of Nile    Glowed, and the desert waters of the sea.      Round and round the Titans' earthy forms    Rolled the hot vapor, and on fiery surge    Streamed upward, swathing in one boundless blaze    The purer air of heaven. Keen rushed the light    In quivering splendor from the writhen flash;    Strong though they were, intolerable smote    Their orbs of sight, and with bedimming glare    Scorched up their blasted vision. Through the gulf    Of yawning chaos the supernal flame    Spread, mingling fire with darkness.      The whirlwinds were abroad, and hollow aroused    A shaking and a gathering dark of dust,    Crushing the thunders from the clouds of air,    Hot thunder-bolts and flames, the fiery darts    Of Jove; and in the midst of either host    They bore upon their blast the cry confused    Of battle, and the shouting. For the din    Tumultuous of that sight-appalling strife    Rose without bound. Stern strength of hardy proof    Wreaked there its deeds, till weary sank the war.      --Trans. by ELTON.    Thus Jupiter, or Jove, became the head of the universe; and to  him is ascribed the creation of the subsequent gods, of man, and  of all animal life, and the supreme control and government of  all. His supremacy is beautifully sung in the following hymn by  the Greek philosopher CLE-AN'THES, said to be the only one of  his numerous writings that has been preserved. Like many others  of the ancient hymns of adoration, it presents us with high  spiritual conceptions of the unity and attributes of Deity; and  had it been addressed to Jehovah it would have been deemed a grand  tribute to his majesty and a noble specimen of deep devotional  feeling.      Hymn to Jupiter.      Most glorious of th' immortal powers above--    O thou of many names--mysterious Jove!    For evermore almighty! Nature's source,    That govern'st all things in their ordered course,    All hail to thee! Since, innocent of blame,    E'en mortal creatures may address thy name--    For all that breathe and creep the lowly earth    Echo thy being with reflected birth--    Thee will I sing, thy strength for aye resound!    The universe that rolls this globe around    Moves wheresoe'er thy plastic influence guides,    And, ductile, owns the god whose arm presides.      The lightnings are thy ministers of ire,    The double-forked and ever-living fire;    In thy unconquerable hand they glow,    And at the flash all nature quakes below.    Thus, thunder-armed, thou dost creation draw    To one immense, inevitable law;    And with the various mass of breathing souls    Thy power is mingled and thy spirit rolls.    Dread genius of creation! all things bow    To thee! the universal monarch thou!    Nor aught is done without thy wise control    On earth, or sea, or round the ethereal pole,    Save when the wicked, in their frenzy blind,    Act o'er the follies of a senseless mind.      Thou curb'st th' excess; confusion to thy sight    Moves regular; th' unlovely scene is bright.    Thy hand, educing good from evil, brings    To one apt harmony the strife of things.    One ever-during law still binds the whole,    Though shunned, resisted, by the sinner's soul.    Wretches! while still they course the glittering prize,    The law of God eludes their ears and eyes.    Life then were virtue, did they this obey;    But"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#7)"],[1,"le, the woman who will faithfully and truly share  my life, well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then  I would rather be subject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity.  Such a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If  I am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly,  I want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs; I want to  be maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly  the better. This too is a luxury.\"    \"Have you lost your senses,\" cried Wanda.    \"I love you with all my soul,\" I continued, \"with all my senses, and  your presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I  am to go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,  make of me your husband or your slave.\"    \"Very well,\" said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched  brows, \"it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,  who interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I  shall not lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice  to me. Therefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make  a plaything for myself out of you!\"    \"Oh, please do,\" I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \"If the  foundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is  likewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We  are such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,  part fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other  anvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down  upon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only  do when she is cruel towards me.\"    \"But, Severin,\" replied Wanda, almost angrily, \"do you believe me  capable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\"    \"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to  love really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her  beauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us  and becomes a despot over us.\"    \"Then that which repels others, attracts you.\"    \"Yes. That is the strange part of me.\"    \"Perhaps, after all, there isn't anything so very unique or strange  in all your passions, for who doesn't love beautiful furs? And  everyone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are  related.\"    \"But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest  degree,\" I replied.    \"In other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by  nature, soft, sensual, yielding.\"    \"Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\"    \"The martyrs?\"    \"On the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in  suffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death  itself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I--_supersensual.\"_    \"Have a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,  the _martyr of a woman_.\"    We are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant  summer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of  climbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable  stars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am  sitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her  of my childhood.    \"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked  in you?\" asked Wanda.    \"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in  my cradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the  healthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.  As a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was  only an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed  by the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually  afraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly,  however, I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood  in my father's little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I  said the prayers I had been taught--the Paternoster, the Ave Maria,  and the Credo.    \"Once at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon  was my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I  prostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen  our peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.    \"An irresistible yearning seized me.    \"I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold  lips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream,  it seemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening  me with up-raised arm.    \"I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I  passionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world  of antiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods  of Greece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he  gave the fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed  Ulysses on his wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful  sank deep into my soul, and consequently at the time when other boys  are coarse and obscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to  everything base, vulgar, unbeautiful.    \"To me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something  especially base and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in  all its commonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in  short, I was supersensual to madness.    \"When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,  young, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was  sitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the  virtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.  Suddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast  to the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.  The kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder,  but I raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress,  and indignantly left the room.\"    Wanda broke out in loud laughter. \"It would, indeed, be hard to find  another man like you, but continue.\"    \"There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\"  I continued my story. \"Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was  visiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an  attractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the  family as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,  malicious, and awkward as possible.    \"One day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt  determined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise  judgment over me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined  _kazabaika,_ [Footnote: A woman's jacket.] followed by the cook,  kitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned.  Without asking any questions, they seized me and bound me hand and  foot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with an evil  smile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch.  She whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,  notwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for  mercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and  thank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.    \"Now you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a  beautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her  fur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on  my aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth.    \"My Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an  excessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a  sort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its  holy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an  ideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.    \"I went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital  where my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor  Faustus's. Everything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge  closets stuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a  Jewish dealer on the Servanica; [Footnote: The street of the Jews in  Lemberg.] there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the heavens,  skeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It looked as  though Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge  green store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.    \"I studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:  chemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and  literature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,  Shakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moliere, the Koran, the Kosmos,  Casanova's Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,  more supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my  imagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a  vision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of  roses, surrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the  Olympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in  braids of a rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt's red velvet  _kazabaika,_ trimmed with ermine.    \"One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my  imagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,  who received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a  kiss of welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was  probably about forty years old, but like most well-preserved women  of the world, still very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged  jacket. This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But  nothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was  now discernable.    \"On the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without  any"]]]
