C. Wray, Royal       Horse Artillery (convalescent); Lieutenant N. W. Haig, 6th       Dragoons (enteric fever, seriously ill, but improving).    Nine hundred and ninety prisoners were removed, however, and, it was  believed, were taken some forty miles from Komati Poort.    On the 8th a curious experience was related by some of the Canadian  Mounted Infantry, who, happening to lose their way and pass,  unchallenged, the Boer lines, found themselves at the little town of  Hebron. The inhabitants imagining them to be the forerunners of a British  force, promptly surrendered arms and ammunition. The Canadians, with a  due sense of humour, engaged in the formalities with becoming gravity,  commandeered an ox-waggon, loaded it with their booty and returned again  through the Boer lines, plus eighty-eight rifles and a big store of  ammunition!      THE BATTLE OF DIAMOND HILL    The outlook was not a cheery one. The enemy, split into small factions,  were bent on playing havoc north and south, and horrible rumours were  afloat which contrived to annoy, perplex, and discourage those who, in  the absence of newspapers and correspondence, gave rein to their  imagination. General Maxwell, who was acting as Governor of Pretoria in  this emergency, inaugurated a system of official bulletins, which served  to distribute what intelligence there might be, and sustain the drooping  spirits of the community. The prolongation of the war, after all seemed  to have been skilfully accomplished, was depressing to even the most  ardent and bellicose mortals. Still more so was it to those who had had  their fill of fighting, and who could not number the list of their  engagements even with the fingers of both hands. It was known that Botha,  after the surrender of the city, had retired with a small force to a  crevice in the hills some fifteen miles east, astride the Delagoa Bay  Railway, and that round him he was gathering a goodly number of burghers,  who assisted him in intimidating other burghers who might have been  willing to tender their submission. As all overtures towards peaceable  negotiations failed, it was necessary to take definite action, and this  on the 11th of June Lord Roberts accordingly did. A great combined  enveloping movement was planned out. General French, with Porter's and  Dickson's Cavalry Brigades, and Hutton's Mounted Infantry, marched out on  the left of the Chief, while General Ian Hamilton with Broadwood and  Gordon's Cavalry Brigades, and Ridley's Mounted Infantry, and General  Bruce Hamilton's Infantry Brigade on his right, prepared to assail the  tremendous frontage of the left of Botha's position. The Dutchman,  perched on a series of steep and irregular hills, and strongly protected  in front, had placed most of his force on his flanks. These he knew by  experience to be his vulnerable points, and against these he divined that  Generals French and Ian Hamilton would be operating. General Pole-Carew,  in the centre, advanced his Division, numbering some 6000 bayonets and  twenty guns, in support of General Ian Hamilton. He moved eastward along  the line and engaged in a duet with the enemy with long-range guns, a  duet which lasted during the whole day. It was found that the enemy's  position extended some sixteen miles, their left, the Diamond Hill, being  so strong and so extended that movement of an enveloping kind was thought  to be almost impossible. Nevertheless, while General French (assisted by  Hutton's Mounted Infantry), through country inimical to cavalry  operations, was perilously and vigorously engaged in making a wide detour  in order to envelop the right flank of the enemy and hold him from  swelling his numbers elsewhere, General Ian Hamilton on the enemy's left  flank (some six miles south of the line), his ambitions centred on  Diamond Hill and the line of rail beyond, operated correspondingly. Far  to right, in a somewhat crab-like fashion, moved the cavalry; Gordon's  Brigade--the outer pincer as it were--wheeled round the almost  impregnable stronghold of the Boers; to left, Ridley's Brigade and De  Lisle's Corps of Mounted Infantry--forming the left or inner  pincer--twisted towards Pienaar's Poort, while Broadwood's Brigade--the  head and front of the creature--endeavoured to spit forth and pierce  through this central gap, and if possible get behind the Boers on Diamond  Hill. Early in the day the southern slopes of Diamond Hill became the  scene of contest between Ridley's Brigade and the enemy, whose rifles  poured their sleet over the advancing mass and whose guns clamoured  loudly in the distance. Broadwood's Brigade, meanwhile, began a bold  advance--across a spruit and over a plain to a passage towards the  railway line--an advance which was hailed more boisterously than  pleasantly by a converging storm from the enemy's heavy guns. Still the  cavalry pushed forward, while Lieutenant Conolly with two horse guns was  set to clear the course. But the Boers, inch by inch, stubbornly  contested the way. The stentorian tones of warring artillery were heard  in an argument that lasted hours, while parties of Boer riflemen  approached with such audacity with a view to the annihilation of the  gunners of Q Battery and the capture of their pieces, that for protection  sake the 12th Lancers were ordered to charge. Unfortunately, at this  critical juncture their commander, the Earl of Airlie, who already had  had his horse shot under him, was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4633"],[0,"Philip Steele of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (#7)"],[1,"through him as his fingers touched the thing for which  they were searching. He drew the scarf out, and returned to the stove  with it, crushing it in both his hands. The sweetness of it came to him  again like the woman's breath. It was the sweetness of her hair, of the  golden coils massed in the firelight; a part of the woman herself,  of her glorious eyes, her lips, her face--and suddenly he crushed the  fabric to his own face, and stood there, trembling in the darkness,  while Jacques Pierrot slept and the storm wailed and moaned over his  head. For he knew--now--that he would do more for this woman than  Jacques Pierrot could ever do; more, perhaps, than even the colonel,  her husband, would do. His heart seemed bursting with a new and terrible  pain, and the truth at last seemed to rise and choke him. He loved her.  He loved this woman, the wife of another man. He loved her as he had  never dreamed that he could love a woman, and with the scarf still  smothering his lips and face he stood for many minutes, silent and  motionless, gathering himself slowly from out of the appalling depths  into which he had allowed himself to plunge.    Then he folded the scarf, and instead of returning it to the box, put it  in one of the pockets of his coat.    \"Pierrot won't care,\" he excused himself. \"And it's the only thing,  little girl--the only thing--I'll ever have--of you.\"        Chapter V. Beauty-Proof    It was Pierrot who aroused Philip in the morning.    \"Mon, Dieu, but you have slept like a bear,\" he exclaimed. \"The storm  has cleared and it will be fine traveling. Eh--you have not heard? I  wonder why they are firing guns off toward Lac Bain!\"    Philip jumped from his bed, and his first look was in the direction of  the box. He was criminal enough to hope that Jacques would not discover  that the scarf was missing.    \"A moose--probably,\" he said. \"There were tracks close up to the post a  day or two ago.\"    He was anxious to begin their journey, and assisted Pierrot in preparing  breakfast. The sound of guns impressed upon him the possibility of some  one from Lac Bain calling at the half-breed's cabin, and he wished to  avoid further association with people from the post--at least for a  time. At nine o'clock Pierrot bolted the door and the two set off into  the south and west. On the third day they swung to the eastward to  strike the Indians living along Reindeer Lake, and on the sixth cut a  trail by compass straight for Nelson House. A week later they arrived at  the post, and Philip found a letter awaiting him calling him to Prince  Albert. In a way the summons was a relief to him. He bade Pierrot  good-by, and set out for Le Pas in company with two Indians. From that  point he took the work train to Etomami, and three hours later was in  Prince Albert.    \"Rest up for a time, Steele,\" Inspector MacGregor told him, after he had  made a personal report on Bucky Nome.    During the week that followed Philip had plenty of leisure in which to  tell himself that he was a fool, and that he was deliberately throwing  away what a munificent fortune had placed in his hands. MacGregor's  announcement that he was in line for promotion in the near future did  not stir him as it would have done a few weeks before. In his little  barracks room he laughed ironically as he recalled MacGregor's words,  \"We're going to make a corporal or a sergeant of you.\" He--Philip  Steele--millionaire, club man, son of a western king of finance--a  corporal or a sergeant! For the first time the thought amused him,  and then it maddened him. He had played the part of an idiot, and all  because there had been born within him a love of adventure and the big,  free life of the open. No wonder some of his old club friends regarded  him as a scapegrace and a ne'er-do-well. He had thrown away position,  power, friends and home as carelessly as he might have tossed away the  end of a cigar. And all--for this! He looked about his cramped quarters,  a half sneer on his lips. He had tied himself to this! To his ears there  came faintly the thunder of galloping hoofs. Sergeant Moody was training  his rookies to ride. The sneer left his lips, and was replaced by  a quick, alert smile as he heard a rattle of revolver shots and the  cheering of voices. After all, it was not so bad. It was a service that  made men, and he thought of the English remittance-man, whose father was  a lord of something-or-other, and who was learning to ride and shoot out  there with red-headed, raucous-voiced Moody. There began to stir in him  again the old desire for action, and he was glad when word was sent to  him that Inspector MacGregor wished to see him in his office.    The big inspector was pacing back and forth when Philip came in.    \"Sit down, Steele, sit down,\" he said. \"Take it easy, man--and have a  cigar.\"    If MacGregor had suddenly gone into a fit Philip could not have been  more surprised than at these words, as he stood with his cap in his hand  before the desk of the fiery-mustached inspector, who was passing his  box of choice Havanas. There are tightly drawn lines of distinction in  the Royal Mounted. As Philip had once heard the commissioner say, \"Every  man in the service is a king--but there are different degrees of kings,\"  and for a barracks man to be asked to sit in the inspector's office  and smoke was a sensational breach of the usual code. But as he had  distinctly heard the invitation to sit, and to smoke, Philip proceeded  to do both, and waited in silence for the next mine to explode under his  feet. And there was a certain ease in his manner of doing these things  which would have assured most men that he was not unaccustomed to  sitting in the presence of greatness.    The inspector seemed to notice this. For a moment he stood squarely in  front of Steele, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, a twinkle in  the cold, almost colorless eyechuckling, companionable laugh, such as  finds its vent in the fellowship of equals, but which is seldom indulged  in by a superior before an inferior in the R.N.W.M. Police.    \"Mighty good cigars, eh, Steele?\" he asked, turning slowly toward the  window. \"The commissioner sent 'em up to me from Regina. Nothing like a  good cigar on a dreary day like this. Whew, listen to the wind--straight  from Medicine Hat!\"    For a few moments he looked out upon the cheerless drab roofs of the  barracks, with their wisps of pale smoke swirling upward into the leaden  sky; counted the dozen gnarled and scrubby trees, as had become a habit  with him; rested his eyes upon the black and shriveled remnants of  summer flower-beds thrusting their frost-shrunken stalks through the  snow, and then, almost as if he were speaking to himself, he said,  \"Steele, are you beautyproof?\"    There was no banter in his voice. It was low, so low that it had in it  the ring of something more than mere desire for answer, and when  the inspector turned, Philip observed a thing that he had never seen  before--a flush in MacGregor's face. His pale eyes gleamed. His voice  was filled with an intense earnestness as he repeated the question. \"I  want to know, Steele. Are you beauty-proof?\"    In spite of himself Philip felt the fire rising in his own face. In that  moment the inspector could have hit on no words that would have thrilled  him more deeply than those which he had spoken. Beauty-proof! Did  MacGregor know? Was it possible-- He took a step forward, words came to  his lips, but he caught himself before he had given voice to them.    Beauty-proof!    He laughed, softly, as the inspector had laughed a few moments before.  But there was a strange tenseness in his face--something which MacGregor  saw, but could not understand.    \"Beauty-proof?\" He repeated the words, looking keenly at the other.  \"Yes, I think I am, sir.\"    \"You think you are?\"    \"I am quite sure that I am. Inspector. That is as far as I can go.\"    The inspector seated himself at his desk and opened a drawer. From it he  took a photograph. For some time he gazed at it in silence, puffing out  clouds of smoke from his cigar. Then, without lifting his eyes from  the picture, he said: \"I am going to put you up against a queer case,  Steele, and the strangest thing about it is its very simplicity. It's a  job for the greenest rookie in the service, and yet I swear that there  isn't another man in Saskatchewan to whom I would talk as I am about to  talk to you. Rather paradoxical, isn't it?\"    \"Rather,\" agreed Philip.    \"And yet not when you come to understand the circumstances,\" continued  the inspector, placing the photograph face down on the table and looking  at the other through a purple cloud of tobacco smoke. \"You see, Steele,  I know who you are. I know that your father is Philip Steele, the big  Chicago banker. I know that you are up here for romance and adventure  rather than for any other thing there is in the service. I know, too,  that you are no prairie chicken, and that most of your life has been  spent where you see beautiful women every hour of the day, and where  soft voices and tender smiles aren't the most wonderful things in the  world, as they sometimes are up here. Fact is, we have a way of our own  of running down records--\"    \"And a confounded clever one it must be,\" interrupted Philip  irreverently. \"Had you any--any particular reason for supposing me to be  'beauty-proof,' as you call it?\" he added coldly.    \"I've told you my only reason,\" said the inspector, leaning over his  desk. \"You've seen so many pretty faces, Steele, and you've associated  with them so long that one up here isn't going to turn your head. Now--\"    MacGregor hesitated, and laughed. The flush grew deeper in his cheeks,  and he looked again at the photograph.    \"I'm going to be frank with you,\" he went on. \"This young woman called  on me yesterday, and within a quarter of an hour--fifteen minutes, mind  you!--she had me going like a fool! Understand? "]]]
