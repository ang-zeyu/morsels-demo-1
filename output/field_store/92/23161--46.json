White cheese is never safe unless you know whence it  comes. _Quien sabe_, it may have been from _leche de Capra_ and  becoming capricious--\"    [Illustration: The apparition at the wheel.]    \"Avast, there!\" I cried. \"I have no mind for moralizing.\"    I made shift to spread a mattress and lie on that instead of the hard  floor, my eyes all the while fastened on my strange guest, who,  remarking again that I would have \"only pains and calentura,\" chuckled  as he chanted a wild song:      High are the waves, fierce, gleaming,      High is the tempest roar!    High the sea-bird screaming!      High the Azore!    I suppose I was now on the mend, for I was peevish, and complained: \"I  detest your jingle. Your Azore should be at roost, and would have been  were it a respectable bird!\" I begged he would tie a rope-yarn on the  rest of the song, if there was any more of it. I was still in agony.  Great seas were boarding the _Spray_, but in my fevered brain I  thought they were boats falling on deck, that careless draymen were  throwing from wagons on the pier to which I imagined the _Spray_ was  now moored, and without fenders to breast her off. \"You'll smash your  boats!\" I called out again and again, as the seas crashed on the cabin  over my head. \"You'll smash your boats, but you can't hurt the  _Spray_. She is strong!\" I cried.    I found, when my pains and calentura had gone, that the deck, now as  white as a shark's tooth from seas washing over it, had been swept of  everything movable. To my astonishment, I saw now at broad day that  the _Spray_ was still heading as I had left her, and was going like a  racehorse. Columbus himself could not have held her more exactly on  her course. The sloop had made ninety miles in the night through a  rough sea. I felt grateful to the old pilot, but I marveled some that  he had not taken in the jib. The gale was moderating, and by noon the  sun was shining. A meridian altitude and the distance on the patent  log, which I always kept towing, told me that she had made a true  course throughout the twenty-four hours. I was getting much better  now, but was very weak, and did not turn out reefs that day or the  night following, although the wind fell light; but I just put my wet  clothes out in the sun when it was shining, and lying down there  myself, fell asleep. Then who should visit me again but my old friend  of the night before, this time, of course, in a dream. \"You did well  last night to take my advice,\" said he, \"and if you would, I should  like to be with you often on the voyage, for the love of adventure  alone.\" Finishing what he had to say, he again doffed his cap and  disappeared as mysteriously as he came, returning, I suppose, to the  phantom _Pinta_. I awoke much refreshed, and with the feeling that I  had been in the presence of a friend and a seaman of vast experience.  I gathered up my clothes, which by this time were dry, then, by  inspiration, I threw overboard all the plums in the vessel.    July 28 was exceptionally fine. The wind from the northwest was light  and the air balmy. I overhauled my wardrobe, and bent on a white shirt  against nearing some coasting-packet with genteel folk on board. I  also did some washing to get the salt out of my clothes. After it all  I was hungry, so I made a fire and very cautiously stewed a dish of  pears and set them carefully aside till I had made a pot of delicious  coffee, for both of which I could afford sugar and cream. But the  crowning dish of all was a fish-hash, and there was enough of it for  two. I was in good health again, and my appetite was simply ravenous.  While I was dining I had a large onion over the double lamp stewing  for a luncheon later in the day. High living to-day!    In the afternoon the _Spray_ came upon a large turtle asleep on the  sea. He awoke with my harpoon through his neck, if he awoke at all. I  had much difficulty in landing him on deck, which I finally  accomplished by hooking the throat-halyards to one of his flippers,  for he was about as heavy as my boat. I saw more turtles, and I rigged  a burton ready with which to hoist them in; for I was obliged to lower  the mainsail whenever the halyards were used for such purposes, and it  was no small matter to hoist the large sail again. But the  turtle-steak was good. I found no fault with the cook, and it was the  rule of the voyage that the cook found no fault with me. There was  never a ship's crew so well agreed. The bill of fare that evening was  turtle-steak, tea and toast, fried potatoes, stewed onions; with  dessert of stewed pears and cream.    Sometime in the afternoon I passed a barrel-buoy adrift, floating  light on the water. It was painted red, and rigged with a signal-staff  about six feet high. A sudden change in the weather coming on, I got  no more turtle or fish of any sort before reaching port. July 31 a  gale sprang up suddenly from the north, with heavy seas, and I  shortened sail. The _Spray_ made only fifty-one miles on her course  that day. August 1 the gale continued, with heavy seas. Through the  night the sloop was reaching, under close-reefed mainsail and bobbed  jib. At 3 P.M. the jib was washed off the bowsprit and blown to rags  and ribbons. I bent the \"jumbo\" on a stay at the night-heads. As for  the jib, let it go; I saved pieces of it, and, after all, I was in  want of pot-rags.    On August 3 the gale broke, and I saw many signs of land. Bad weather  having made itself felt in the galley, I was minded to try my hand at  a loaf of bread, and so rigging a pot of fire on deck by which to bake  it, a loaf soon became an accomplished fact. One great feature about  ship's cooking is that one's appetite on the sea is always good--a  fact that I realized when I cooked for the crew of fishermen in the  before-mentioned boyhood days. Dinner being over, I sat for hours  reading the life of Columbus, and as the day wore on I watched the  birds all flying in one direction, and said, \"Land lies there.\"    Early the next morning, August 4, I discovered Spain. I saw fires on  shore, and knew that the country was inhabited. The _Spray_ continued  on her course till well in with the land, which was that about  Trafalgar. Then keeping away a point, she passed through the Strait of  Gibraltar, where she cast anchor at 3 P. M. of the same day, less than  twenty-nine days from Cape Sable. At the finish of this preliminary  trip I found myself in excellent health, not overworked or cramped,  but as well as ever in my life, though I was as thin as a reef-point.    [Illustration: Coming to anchor at Gibraltar.]    Two Italian barks, which had been close alongside at daylight, I saw  long after I had anchored, passing up the African side of the strait.  The _Spray_ had sailed them both hull down before she reached Tarifa.  So far as I know, the _Spray_ beat everything going across the  Atlantic except the steamers.    All was well, but I had forgotten to bring a bill of health from  Horta, and so when the fierce old port doctor came to inspect there  was a row. That, however, was the very thing needed. If you want to  get on well with a true Britisher you must first have a deuce of a row  with him. I knew that well enough, and so I fired away, shot for shot,  as best I could. \"Well, yes,\" the doctor admitted at last, \"your crew  are healthy enough, no doubt, but who knows the diseases of your last  port?\"--a reasonable enough remark. \"We ought to put you in the fort,  sir!\" he blustered; \"but never mind. Free pratique, sir! Shove off,  cockswain!\" And that was the last I saw of the port doctor.    But on the following morning a steam-launch, much longer than the  _Spray_, came alongside,--or as much of her as could get  alongside,--with compliments from the senior naval officer, Admiral  Bruce, saying there was a berth for the _Spray_ at the arsenal. This  was around at the new mole. I had anchored at the old mole, among the  native craft, where it was rough and uncomfortable. Of course I was  glad to shift, and did so as soon as possible, thinking of the great  company the _Spray_ would be in among battle-ships such as the  _Collingwood_, _Balfleur_, and _Cormorant_, which were at that time  stationed there, and on board all of which I was entertained, later,  most royally.    \"'Put it thar!' as the Americans say,\" was the salute I got from  Admiral Bruce, when I called at the admiralty to thank him for his  courtesy of the berth, and for the use of the steam-launch which towed  me into dock. \"About the berth, it is all right if it suits, and we'll  tow you out when you are ready to go. But, say, what repairs do you  want? Ahoy the _Hebe_, can you spare your sailmaker? The _Spray_ wants  a new jib. Construction and repair, there! will you see to the  _Spray_? Say, old man, you must have knocked the devil out of her  coming over alone in twenty-nine days! But we'll make it smooth for  you here!\" Not even her Majesty's ship the _Collingwood_ was better  looked after than the _Spray_ at Gibraltar.    [Illustration: The _Spray_ at anchor off Gibraltar.]    Later in the day came the hail: \"_Spray_ ahoy! Mrs. Bruce would like  to come on board and shake hands with the _Spray_. Will it be  convenient to-day!\" \"Very!\" I joyfully shouted.    On the following day Sir F. Carrington, at the time governor of  Gibraltar, with other high officers of the garrison, and all the  commanders of the battle-ships, came on board and signed their names  in the _Spray's_ log-book. Again there was a hail, \"_Spray_ ahoy!\"  \"Hello!\" \"Commander Reynolds's compliments. You are invited on board  H.M.S. _Collingwood_, 'at home' at 4:30 P.M. Not later than 5:30 P.M.\"  I had already hinted at the limited amount of my wardrobe, and that I  could never succeed as a dude. \"You are expected, sir, in a stovepipe  hat and a claw-hammer coat!\" \"Then I can't come.\" \"Dash"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#7)"],[1,"refit. This news was confirmed by private letters,  assuring us that the Jaramas, which was the name of the frigate,  would not reach Marseilles before the spring.    We felt no inclination to prolong our stay in Provence till that  period. The country, and especially the climate, were delightful,  but the aspect of the sea reminded us of the failure of our  projects. In an excursion we made to Hyeres and Toulon, we found in  the latter port the frigate la Boudeuse, which had been commanded  by M. de Bougainville, in his voyage round the world. She was then  fitting out for Corsica. M. de Bougainville had honoured me with  particular kindness during my stay in Paris, when I was preparing  to accompany the expedition of captain Baudin. I cannot describe  the impression made upon my mind by the sight of the vessel which  had carried Commerson to the islands of the South Sea. In some  conditions of the mind, a painful emotion blends itself with all  our feelings.    We still persisted in the intention of visiting the African coast,  and were nearly becoming the victims of our perseverance. A small  vessel of Ragusa, on the point of setting sail for Tunis, was at  that time in the port of Marseilles; we thought the opportunity  favourable for reaching Egypt and Syria, and we agreed with the  captain for our passage. The vessel was to sail the following day;  but a circumstance trivial in itself happily prevented our  departure. The live-stock intended to serve us for food during our  passage, was kept in the great cabin. We desired that some changes  should be made, which were indispensable for the safety of our  instruments; and during this interval we learnt at Marseilles, that  the government of Tunis persecuted the French residing in Barbary,  and that every person coming from a French port was thrown into a  dungeon. Having escaped this imminent danger, we were compelled to  suspend the execution of our projects. We resolved to pass the  winter in Spain, in hopes of embarking the next spring, either at  Carthagena, or at Cadiz, if the political situation of the East  permitted.    We crossed Catalonia and the kingdom of Valencia, on our way to  Madrid. We visited the ruins of Tarragona and those of ancient  Saguntum; and from Barcelona we made an excursion to Montserrat,  the lofty peaks of which are inhabited by hermits, and where the  contrast between luxuriant vegetation and masses of naked and arid  rocks, forms a landscape of a peculiar character. I employed myself  in ascertaining by astronomical observations the position of  several points important for the geography of Spain, and determined  by means of the barometer the height of the central plain. I  likewise made several observations on the inclination of the  needle, and on the intensity of the magnetic forces.    On my arrival at Madrid I had reason to congratulate myself on the  resolution I had formed of visiting the Peninsula. Baron de Forell,  minister from the court of Saxony, treated me with a degree of  kindness, of which I soon felt the value. He was well versed in  mineralogy, and was full of zeal for every undertaking that  promoted the progress of knowledge. He observed to me, that under  the administration of an enlightened minister, Don Mariano Luis de  Urquijo, I might hope to obtain permission to visit, at my own  expense, the interior of Spanish America. After the disappointments  I had suffered, I did not hesitate a moment to adopt this idea.    I was presented at the court of Aranjuez in March 1799 and the king  received me graciously. I explained to him the motives which led me  to undertake a voyage to the new world and the Philippine Islands,  and I presented a memoir on the subject to the secretary of state.  Senor de Urquijo supported my demand, and overcame every obstacle.  I obtained two passports, one from the first secretary of state,  the other from the council of the Indies. Never had so extensive a  permission been granted to any traveller, and never had any  foreigner been honoured with more confidence on the part of the  Spanish government.    Many considerations might have induced us to prolong our abode in  Spain. The abbe Cavanilles, no less remarkable for the variety of  his attainments than his acute intelligence; M. Nee, who, together  with M. Haenke, had, as botanist, made part of the expedition of  Malaspina, and who had formed one of the greatest herbals ever seen  in Europe; Don Casimir Ortega, the abbe Pourret, and the learned  authors of the Flora of Peru, Messrs. Ruiz and Pavon, all opened to  us without reserve their rich collections. We examined part of the  plants of Mexico, discovered by Messrs. Sesse, Mocino, and  Cervantes, whose drawings had been sent to the Museum of Natural  History of Madrid. This great establishment, the direction of which  was confided to Senor Clavijo, author of an elegant translation of  the works of Buffon, offered us, it is true, no geological  representation of the Cordilleras, but M. Proust, so well known by  the great accuracy of his chemical labours, and a distinguished  mineralogist, M. Hergen, gave us curious details on several mineral  substances of America. It would have been useful to us to have  employed a longer time in studying the productions of the countries  which were to be the objects of our research, but our impatience to  take advantage of the permission given us by the court was too  great to suffer us to delay our departure. For a year past, I had  experienced so many disappointments, that I could scarcely persuade  myself that my most ardent wishes would be at length fulfilled.    We left Madrid about the middle of May, crossed a part of Old  Castile, the kingdoms of Leon and Galicia, and reached Corunna,  whence we were to embark for Cuba. The winter having been  protracted and severe, we enjoyed during the journey that mild  temperature of the spring, which in so southern a latitude usually  occurs during March and April. The snow still covered the lofty  granitic tops of the Guadarama; but in the deep valleys of Galicia,  which resemble the most picturesque spots of Switzerland and the  Tyrol, cistuses loaded with flowers; and arborescent heaths clothed  every rock. We quitted without regret the elevated plain of the two  Castiles, which is everywhere devoid of vegetation, and where the  severity of the winter's cold is followed by the overwhelming heat  of summer. From the few observations I personally made, the  interior of Spain forms a vast plain, elevated three hundred toises  (five hundred and eighty-four metres) above the level of the ocean,  is covered with secondary formations, grit-stone, gypsum, sal-gem,  and the calcareous stone of Jura. The climate of the Castiles is  much colder than that of Toulon and Genoa; its mean temperature  scarcely rises to 15 degrees of the centigrade thermometer.    We are astonished to find that, in the latitude of Calabria,  Thessaly, and Asia Minor, orange-trees do not flourish in the open  air. The central elevated plain is encircled by a low and narrow  zone, where the chamaerops, the date-tree, the sugar-cane, the  banana, and a number of plants common to Spain and the north of  Africa, vegetate on several spots, without suffering from the  rigours of winter. From the 36th to 40th degrees of latitude, the  medium temperature of this zone is from 17 to 20 degrees; and by a  concurrence of circumstances, which it would be too long to  explain, this favoured region has become the principal seat of  industry and intellectual improvement.    When, in the kingdom of Valencia, we ascend from the shore of the  Mediterranean towards the lofty plains of La Mancha and the  Castiles, we seem to discern, far inland, from the lengthened  declivities, the ancient coast of the Peninsula. This curious  phenomenon recalls the traditions of the Samothracians, and other  historical testimonies, according to which it is supposed that the  irruption of the waters through the Dardanelles, augmenting the  basin of the Mediterranean, rent and overflowed the southern part  of Europe. If we admit that these traditions owe their origin, not  to mere geological reveries, but to the remembrance of some ancient  catastrophe, we may conceive the central elevated plain of Spain  resisting the efforts of these great inundations, till the draining  of the waters, by the straits formed between the pillars of  Hercules, brought the Mediterranean progressively to its present  level, lower Egypt emerging above its surface on the one side, and  the fertile plains of Tarragona, Valencia, and Murcia, on the  other. Everything that relates to the formation of that sea,* (*  Some of the ancient geographers believed that the Mediterranean,  swelled by the waters of the Euxine, the Palus Maeotis, the Caspian  Sea, and the Sea of Aral, had broken the pillars of Hercules;  others admitted that the irruption was made by the waters of the  ocean. In the first of these hypotheses, the height of the land  between the Black Sea and the Baltic, and between the ports of  Cette and Bordeaux, determine the limit which the accumulation of  the waters may have reached before the junction of the Black Sea,  the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic, as well to the north of the  Dardanelles, as to the east of this strip of land which formerly  joined Europe to Mauritania, and of which, in the time of Strabo,  certain vestiges remained in the Islands of Juno and the Moon.)  which has had so powerful an influence on the first civilization of  mankind, is highly interesting. We might suppose, that Spain,  forming a promontory amidst the waves, was indebted for its  preservation to the height of its land; but in order to give weight  to these theoretic ideas, we must clear up the doubts that have  arisen respecting the rupture of so many transverse dikes;--we must  discuss the probability of the Mediterranean having been formerly  divided into several separate"]]]
