[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#7)"],[1,"magic, if you will.'    Conan had already reached that conclusion, and was mulling over  something else.    'I think I understand why you spared my life,' he rumbled. 'Amalric  wants to keep me as a check on Valerius, in case the impossible happens  and he becomes king of Aquilonia. It's well known that the baron of Tor  is behind this move to seat Valerius on my throne. And if I know  Amalric, he doesn't intend that Valerius shall be anything more than a  figurehead, as Tarascus is now.'    'Amalric knows nothing of your capture,' answered Xaltotun. 'Neither  does Valerius. Both think you died at Valkia.'    Conan's eyes narrowed as he stared at the man in silence.    'I sensed a brain behind all this,' he muttered, 'but I thought it was  Amalric's. Are Amalric, Tarascus and Valerius all but puppets dancing on  your string? Who are you?'    'What does it matter? If I told you, you would not believe me. What if I  told you I might set you back on the throne of Aquilonia?'    Conan's eyes burned on him like a wolf.    'What's your price?'    'Obedience to me.'    'Go to hell with your offer!' snarled Conan. 'I'm no figurehead. I won  my crown with my sword. Besides, it's beyond your power to buy and sell  the throne of Aquilonia at your will. The kingdom's not conquered; one  battle doesn't decide a war.'    'You war against more than swords,' answered Xaltotun. 'Was it a  mortal's sword that felled you in your tent before the fight? Nay, it  was a child of the dark, a waif of outer space, whose fingers were afire  with the frozen coldness of the black gulfs, which froze the blood in  your veins and the marrow of your thews. Coldness so cold it burned your  flesh like white-hot iron!    'Was it chance that led the man who wore your harness to lead his  knights into the defile?--chance that brought the cliffs crashing down  upon them?'    Conan glared at him unspeaking, feeling a chill along his spine. Wizards  and sorcerers abounded in his barbaric mythology, and any fool could  tell that this was no common man. Conan sensed an inexplicable something  about him that set him apart--an alien aura of Time and Space, a sense  of tremendous and sinister antiquity. But his stubborn spirit refused to  flinch.    'The fall of the cliffs was chance,' he muttered truculently. 'The  charge into the defile was what any man would have done.'    'Not so. You would not have led a charge into it. You would have  suspected a trap. You would never have crossed the river in the first  place, until you were sure the Nemedian rout was real. Hypnotic  suggestions would not have invaded your mind, even in the madness of  battle, to make you mad, and rush blindly into the trap laid for you, as  it did the lesser man who masqueraded as you.'    'Then if this was all planned,' Conan grunted skeptically, 'all a plot  to trap my host, why did not the \"child of darkness\" kill me in my  tent?'    'Because I wished to take you alive. It took no wizardry to predict that  Pallantides would send another man out in your harness. I wanted you  alive and unhurt. You may fit into my scheme of things. There is a vital  power about you greater than the craft and cunning of my allies. You are  a bad enemy, but might make a fine vassal.'    Conan spat savagely at the word, and Xaltotun, ignoring his fury, took a  crystal globe from a near-by table and placed it before him. He did not  support it in any way, nor place it on anything, but it hung motionless  in midair, as solidly as if it rested on an iron pedestal. Conan snorted  at this bit of necromancy, but he was nevertheless impressed.    'Would you know of what goes on in Aquilonia?' he asked.    Conan did not reply, but the sudden rigidity of his form betrayed his  interest.    Xaltotun stared into the cloudy depths, and spoke: 'It is now the  evening of the day after the battle of Valkia. Last night the main body  of the army camped by Valkia, while squadrons of knights harried the  fleeing Aquilonians. At dawn the host broke camp and pushed westward  through the mountains. Prospero, with ten thousand Poitanians, was miles  from the battlefield when he met the fleeing survivors in the early  dawn. He had pushed on all night, hoping to reach the field before the  battle joined. Unable to rally the remnants of the broken host, he fell  back toward Tarantia. Riding hard, replacing his wearied horses with  steeds seized from the countryside, he approaches Tarantia.    'I see his weary knights, their armor gray with dust, their pennons  drooping as they push their tired horses through the plain. I see, also,  the streets of Tarantia. The city is in turmoil. Somehow word has  reached the people of the defeat and the death of King Conan. The mob is  mad with fear, crying out that the king is dead, and there is none to  lead them against the Nemedians. Giant shadows rush on Aquilonia from  the east, and the sky is black with vultures.'    Conan cursed deeply.    'What are these but words? The raggedest beggar in the street might  prophesy as much. If you say you saw all that in the glass ball, then  you're a liar as well as a knave, of which last there's no doubt!  Prospero will hold Tarantia, and the barons will rally to him. Count  Trocero of Poitain commands the kingdom in my absence, and he'll drive  these Nemedian dogs howling back to their kennels. What are fifty  thousand Nemedians? Aquilonia will swallow them up. They'll never see  Belverus again. It's not Aquilonia which was conquered at Valkia; it was  only Conan.'    'Aquilonia is doomed,' answered Xaltotun, unmoved. 'Lance and ax and  torch shall conquer her; or if they fail, powers from the dark of ages  shall march against her. As the cliffs fell at Valkia, so shall walled  cities and mountains fall, if the need arise, and rivers roar from their  channels to drown whole provinces.    'Better if steel and bowstring prevail without further aid from the  _arts_, for the constant use of mighty spells sometimes sets forces in  motion that might rock the universe.'    'From what hell have you crawled, you nighted dog?' muttered Conan,  staring at the man. The Cimmerian involuntarily shivered; he sensed  something incredibly ancient, incredibly evil.    Xaltotun lifted his head, as if listening to whispers across the void.  He seemed to have forgotten his prisoner. Then he shook his head  impatiently, and glanced impersonally at Conan.    'What? Why, if I told you, you would not believe me. But I am wearied of  conversation with you; it is less fatiguing to destroy a walled city  than it is to frame my thoughts in words a brainless barbarian can  understand.'    'If my hands were free,' opined Conan, 'I'd soon make a brainless corpse  out of you.'    'I do not doubt it, if I were fool enough to give you the opportunity,'  answered Xaltotun, clapping his hands.    His manner had changed; there was impatience in his tone, and a certain  nervousness in his manner, though Conan did not think this attitude was  in any way connected with himself.    'Consider what I have told you, barbarian,' said Xaltotun. 'You will  have plenty of leisure. I have not yet decided what I shall do with you.  It depends on circumstances yet unborn. But let this be impressed upon  you: that if I decide to use you in my game, it will be better to submit  without resistance than to suffer my wrath.'    Conan spat a curse at him, just as hangings that masked a door swung  apart and four giant negroes entered. Each was clad only in a silken  breech-cloth supported by a girdle, from which hung a great key.    Xaltotun gestured impatiently toward the king and turned away, as if  dismissing the matter entirely from his mind. His fingers twitched  queerly. From a carven green jade box he took a handful of shimmering  black dust, and placed it in a brazier which stood on a golden tripod at  his elbow. The crystal globe, which he seemed to have forgotten, fell  suddenly to the floor, as if its invisible support had been removed.    Then the blacks had lifted Conan--for so loaded with chains was he that  he could not walk--and carried him from the chamber. A glance back,  before the heavy, gold-bound teak door was closed, showed him Xaltotun  leaning back in his throne-like chair, his arms folded, while a thin  wisp of smoke curled up from the brazier. Conan's scalp prickled. In  Stygia, that ancient and evil kingdom that lay far to the south, he had  seen such black dust before. It was the pollen of the black lotus, which  creates death-like sleep and monstrous dreams; and he knew that only the  grisly wizards of the Black Ring, which is the nadir of evil,  voluntarily seek the scarlet nightmares of the black lotus, to revive  their necromantic powers.    The Black Ring was a fable and a lie to most folk of the western world,  but Conan knew of its ghastly reality, and its grim votaries who  practise their abominable sorceries amid the black vaults of Stygia and  the nighted domes of accursed Sabatea.    He glanced back at the cryptic, gold-bound door, shuddering at what it  hid.    Whether it was day or night the king could not tell. The palace of King  Tarascus seemed a shadowy, nighted place, that shunned natural  illumination. The spirit of darkness and shadow hovered over it, and  that spirit, Conan felt, was embodied in the stranger Xaltotun. The  negroes carried the king along a winding corridor so dimly lighted that  they moved through it like black ghosts bearing a dead man, and down a  stone stair that wound endlessly. A torch in the hand of one cast the  great deformed shadows streaming along the wall; it was like the descent  into hell of a corpse borne by dusky demons.    At last they reached the foot of the stair, and then they traversed a  long straight corridor, with a blank wall on one hand pierced by an  occasional arched doorway with a stair leading up behind it, and on the  other hand another wall showing heavy barred doors at regular intervals  of a few"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#7)"],[1,"seats.    The crowd set up a cheer, and hundreds pressed around the aviators.  Several sought to reach, and touch the machine, for they had  probably never been so close to one before, though airship flights  are getting more and more common.    \"Where did you come from?\"    \"Are you trying for a record?\"    \"How high did you get?\"    \"Did you fall, or come down on purpose?\"    \"Can't you start your motor in mid-air?\"    These, and scores of other questions were fairly volleyed at Tom and  Mr. Damon. The young inventor good-naturedly answered them as best  he could.    \"We were coming down anyhow,\" he explained, \"but we did not  calculate on vol-planing. The motor was stalled, and I had to glide.  Please keep away from the machine. You might damage it.\"    The arrival of several policemen, who were attracted by the crowd,  served to keep the curious ones back away from the BUTTERFLY, or the  men, boys and women (for there were a number of the latter in the  throng) might have caused serious trouble.    Tom made a hasty examination of the motor, and, having satisfied  himself that only a minor difficulty had caused it to stop, he  decided to put the monoplane in some safe place, and proceed to Mr.  Fenwick's house.    The lad was just asking one of the officers if the air craft could  not be put in one of the grandstands which surrounded the field,  when a voice on the outskirts of the crowd excitedly exclaimed:    \"Let me pass, please. I want to see that airship. I'm building one  myself, and I need all the experience I can get. Let me in, please.\"    A man pushed his way into the crowd, and wormed his way to where Tom  and Mr. Damon stood. At the sight of him, the eccentric individual  cried out:    \"Why bless my pocket-knife! If it isn't Mr. Fenwick!\"    \"Mr. Fenwick?\" gasped Tom.    \"Yes. The inventor we came to see!\"    At the same moment the newcomer cried out:    \"Wakefield Damon!\"    \"That's who I am,\" answered Tom's friend, \"and let me introduce you  to Mr. Swift, the inventor of more machines than I can count. He and  I were coming to see you, when we had a slight accident, and we  landed here. But that didn't matter, for we intended to land here  anyhow, as I knew it was near your house. Only we had to vol-plane  back to earth, and I can't say that I'd care for that, as a steady  diet. Bless my radiator, but I'm glad we've arrived safely.\"    \"Did you come all the way from your home in that?\" asked Mr. Fenwick  of Tom, as he shook hands with him, and nodded at the monoplane.    \"Oh, yes. It's not much of a trip.\"    \"Well, I hope my airship will do as well. But something seems to be  wrong with it, and I have hopes that you can help me discover what  it is, I know your father, and I have heard much of your ability.  That is why I requested your aid.\"    \"I'm afraid I've been much overrated,\" spoke Tom, modestly, \"but  I'll do all I can for you. I must now leave my monoplane in a safe  place, however.\"    \"I'll attend to that,\" Mr. Fenwick hastened to assure him. \"Leave it  to me.\"    By this time a lieutenant of police, in charge of several reserve  officers, had arrived on the scene, for the crowd was now very  large, and, as Mr. Fenwick knew this official, he requested that  Tom's machine be protected from damage. It was arranged that it  could be stored in a large, empty shed, and a policeman would be  left on guard. Then, seeing that it was all right, Tom, Mr. Damon  and Mr. Fenwick started for the latter's house.    \"I am very anxious to show you the WHIZZER,\" said Mr. Fenwick, as  they walked along.    \"The WHIZZER?\" repeated Tom, wonderingly.    \"Yes, that's what I call my electric airship. It hasn't 'whizzed'  any to speak of yet, but I have hopes that it will, now that you are  here to help me. We will take one of these taxicabs, and soon be at  my house. I was out for a stroll, when I saw your monoplane coming  down, and I hastened to Franklin Field to see it.\"    The three entered an automobile, and were soon being driven to the  inventor's home. A little later he led them out to a big shed which  occupied nearly all of a large lot, in back of Mr. Fenwick's house.    \"Does it take up all that room?\" asked Tom.    \"Oh, yes, the WHIZZER is pretty good size. There she is!\" cried Mr.  Fenwick proudly, as he threw open the doors of the shed, and Tom and  Mr. Damon, looking in, saw a large triplane, with a good-sized gas  bag hovering over it, and a strange collection of rudders, wings and  planes sticking out from either side. Amidships was an enclosed car,  or cabin, and a glimpse into it served to disclose to the young  inventor a mass of machinery.    \"There she is! That's the WHIZZER!\" cried Mr. Fenwick, with pride in  his voice. \"What do you think of her, Tom Swift?\"    Tom did not immediately answer. He looked dubiously at the electric  airship and shrugged his shoulders. It seemed to him, at first  glance, that, it would never sail.          CHAPTER VII    MAKING SOME CHANGES      \"Well, what do you think of it?\" asked Mr. Fenwick again, as Tom  walked all about the electric airship, still without speaking.    \"It's big, certainly,\" remarked the lad.    \"Bless my shoe horn! I should say it was!\" burst out Mr. Damon.  \"It's larger than your RED CLOUD, Tom.\"    \"But will it go? That's what I want to know,\" insisted the inventor.  \"Do you think it will fly, Tom? I haven't dared to try it yet,  though a small model which I made floated in the air for some time.  But it wouldn't move, except as the wind blew it.\"    \"It would be hard to say, without a careful examination, whether  this large one will fly or not,\" answered Tom.    \"Then give it a careful examination,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick. \"I'll  pay you well for your time and trouble.\"    \"Oh if I can help a fellow inventor, and assist in making a new  model of airship fly, I'm only too glad to do it without pay,\"  retorted Tom, quickly. \"I didn't come here for that. Suppose we go  in the cabin, and look at the motor. That's the most important  point, if your airship is to navigate.\"    There was certainly plenty of machinery in the cabin of the WHIZZER.  Most of it was electrical, for on that power Mr. Fenwick intended to  depend to sail through space. There was a new type of gasolene  engine, small but very powerful, and this served to operate a  dynamo. In turn, the dynamo operated an electrical motor, as Mr.  Fenwick had an idea that better, and more uniform, power could be  obtained in this way, than from a gasolene motor direct. One  advantage which Tom noticed at once, was that the WHIZZER had a  large electric storage battery.    This was intended to operate the electric motor in case of a break  to the main machinery, and it seemed a good idea. There were various  other apparatuses, machines, and appliances, the nature of which Tom  could not readily gather from a mere casual view.    \"Well, what's your opinion, now that you have seen the motor?\" asked  Mr. Fenwick, anxiously.    \"I'd have to see it in operation,\" said Tom.    \"And you shall, right after dinner,\" declared the inventor. \"I'd  like to start it now, and hear what you have to say, but I'm not so  selfish as that. I know you must be hungry after your trip from  Shopton, as they say aeroplaning gives one an appetite.\"    \"I don't know whether it's that or not,\" answered Tom with a laugh,  \"but I am certainly hungry.\"    \"Then we'll postpone the trial until after dinner. It must be ready  by this time, I think,\" said Mr. Fenwick, as he led the way back to  the house. It was magnificently furnished, for the inventor was a  man of wealth, and only took up aeroplaning as a \"fad.\" An excellent  dinner was served, and then the three returned once more to the shed  where the WHIZZER was kept.    \"Shall I start the motor in here?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, when he had  summoned several of the machinists whom he employed, to aid himself  and the young inventor.    \"It would be better if we could take it outside,\" suggested Tom,  \"yet a crowd is sure to gather, and I don't like to work in a mob of  people.\"    \"Oh, we can easily get around that,\" said Mr. Fenwick. \"I have two  openings to my aeroplane shed. We can take the WHIZZER out of the  rear door, into a field enclosed by a high fence. That is where I  made all my trials, and the crowd couldn't get in, though some boys  did find knot-holes and use them. But I don't mind that. The only  thing that bothers me is that I can't make the WHIZZER go up, and if  it won't go up, it certainly won't sail. That's my difficulty, and I  hope you can remedy it, Tom Swift.\"    \"I'll do the best I can. But let's get the airship outside.\"    This was soon accomplished, and in the open lot Tom made a thorough  and careful examination of the mechanism. The motor was started, and  the propellers, for there were two, whirled around at rapid speed.    Tom made some tests and calculations, at which he was an expert, and  applied the brake test, to see how much horse power the motor would  deliver.    \"I think there is one trouble that we will have to get over,\" he  finally said to Mr. Fenwick.    \"What is that?\"    \"The motor is not quite powerful enough because of the way in which  you have it geared up. I think by changing some of the cogs, and  getting rid of the off-set shaft, also by increasing the number of  revolutions, and perhaps by using a new style of carburetor, we can  get more speed and power.\"    \"Then we'll do it!\" cried Mr. Fenwick, with enthusiasm. \"I knew I  hadn't got everything just right. Do you think it will work after  that?\"    \"Well,\" remarked Tom, hesitatingly, \"I think the arrangement of the  planes will also have to be changed. It will take quite some work,  but perhaps, after a bit, we can get the WHIZZER up in the air.\"    \"Can you begin work at once?\" asked the inventor, eagerly.    Tom shook his head.    \"I can't stay long enough on this trip,\" he said. \"I promised father  I would be back by to-morrow at the latest,"]]]
