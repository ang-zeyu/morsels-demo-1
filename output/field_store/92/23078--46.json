[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#7)"],[1," South African problems of primary  importance--the settlement of the native question, agricultural  development, and railway administration--can only be obtained through a  Federal Parliament, a body which would combine a detailed knowledge of  local conditions with the power of seeing each problem as a whole, and  devising a general solution.      II    The foregoing contains the gist of many conversations with those who  have a special knowledge of South Africa and South African affairs. The  opinions of Sir Albert Hime, the Prime Minister of Natal, who may  certainly claim to speak in this matter on behalf of the South African  loyalists, were expressed as follows in an interview with the writer:--    \"I am convinced that the majority of South Africans are anxious to see a  'United South Africa,' and I believe they will see it before long. I  cannot, of course, speak for the Dutch; but I am sure that every  'Britisher' in Natal and in Rhodesia, and nine out of every ten  'Britishers' in the rest of South Africa, are in favour of federation.  The great problems of South African development can only be completely  solved by a central authority. The native problem, for example, which is  the most serious of all, is a case in point. The difficulty of obtaining  a sufficient supply of native labour--a difficulty only to be overcome  by increasing the wants of the natives--is only one phase of this  problem, but it will supply an illustration of the necessity of  considering the interests of the whole country in dealing with such  matters. As things are arranged at present, the planters and farmers of  Natal have a reasonable cause of complaint in the fact that all their  available supply of native labour is drawn away to the Rand mines. I may  add that the solidarity of South African opinion in regard to the  treatment of the natives--all white men in South Africa are agreed, for  example, that they must never have the franchise, and that no attempt  should be made to create a navvy class in South Africa to compete with  the natives in the unskilled labour market--is a great unifying  influence. The matter of agricultural settlement is another problem  which should be considered with reference to the general interests of  the whole country. There is an impression current in certain quarters  that immigration should be diverted into the new Colonies. But once the  conception of a United South Africa is grasped, it is obvious that a new  British settler in Natal will do as much for the maintenance of British  supremacy as a new British settler in the Transvaal. If South Africa is  not to become a country of two or three large cities in a huge, sparsely  settled territory, the problem of agricultural development should be  dealt with on the broadest lines, and in the interest of the whole  country. Natal has no intention whatever of pursuing a selfish policy in  regard to the work of procuring settlers or of obtaining a share of the  Transvaal traffic.\"    Asked to express his opinion as to when the \"United South Africa\" of his  hopes would come into being, Sir Albert Hime naturally enough refused to  suggest a date. \"But I am strongly of opinion that federation should  take place before the new Colonies receive self-government, or, at any  rate, concurrently with that event. That would be the safest course; for  it is quite possible that the new Colonies, after they had received  autonomy, would refuse to join. Once they have attained the privileges  of self-government as part and parcel of a 'United South Africa,' I do  not think there would be any special friction; if there was, it would  gradually disappear as local jealousies grew less.\"    \"Though I do not regard the question of South African Federation as a  matter of merely academic interest,\" continued Sir Albert Hime, \"yet I  think it would serve no useful purpose to discuss the details of a  federal scheme at the present moment. But, for my own part, I do not  regard the arguments of Mr. Cecil Rhodes in favour of making Cape Town  the federal capital as conclusive. In a speech at Bulawayo, Mr. Cecil  Rhodes summed up those arguments in a forcible manner, and his bequest  of Groote Schuur as a residence for the Premier of the United South  Africa that is to be, is an additional argument of considerable weight.  But I am inclined to think that the fact that the Cape Peninsula is, as  Mr. Rhodes said, the seaside sanatorium of South Africa, would not  compensate for the remoteness of Cape Town from the centre of the new  federation. And, again, if Cape Town were chosen there would be a  tendency to make too much of Cape politics, and the spirit of Cape  politicians might tend to dominate the Federal Parliament. Johannesburg  would be a bad choice. Living will always be costly there, and the  influence of cosmopolitan capitalists might be exerted with bad results.  Of course we should be glad to have the capital in Natal, but I do not  expect we shall have that honour. All things considered, Bloemfontein  would perhaps be the best choice. Or we might follow the example of the  United States, Canada, and Australia, and settle the claims of the  existing capitals by creating a new city for our federal capital.\"      III    Sir Edward Barton was at first unwilling to express an opinion on a  subject \"in which many with better knowledge have a deep interest.\" \"But  I am confident,\" he continued, \"that before many years have passed away  we shall see a Federated South Africa, and that no South African will  wish to return to the old order of things once that federation has come  into being. I still believe that the form chosen for the constitution of  the Australian Commonwealth was the best available, and I think that it  would be better suited to South Africa than the Canadian form. But  whichever form is chosen, the whole community will benefit by  federation.    \"We in Australia have had great difficulties to overcome, and a certain  amount of friction has necessarily arisen between the States and the  federal authority, but the history of the United States and of the  Dominion shows that such difficulties and friction cannot be avoided,  but can always be surmounted. With the exception of a few discontented  persons, I think nobody in Australia would be in favour of a return to  the old order of things, and it is already clear that the local  jealousies which hampered Australian progress are vanishing. When I was  in British Columbia nine years ago, I tried hard to find a man who  believed that the act of confederation should be undone; but I could not  discover such a person. There may be a few 'Blue Noses' in Nova Scotia  who would like to see confederation abolished, but I never met one. In  either case, the fact that Annexationists are few--too few to be  counted--in Canada, explains my failure. And once South African  Federation is an accomplished fact--and though the racial antithesis, as  was the case in Canada, renders the accomplishment more difficult than  in Australia, where a difference in opinion as to fiscal policy was the  chief obstacle--I am very sure that the vast majority of South Africans,  whether British or Dutch, will refuse to contemplate a change to the old  state of local jealousies. The sooner South African Federation comes,  the better for South Africa.\"    [Illustration: CHURCH STREET, PRETORIA THE APPROACH TO THE TOWN.    Drawn by Donald E. M'Cracken.]    Asked to answer the question: Should federation come before the new  Colonies receive self-government, or concurrently with that event? Sir  Edward Barton replied that in his opinion either course would create  difficulties for the future.    \"Australian Federation,\" he continued, \"came out of the will of the  people. The result of a referendum proved that a majority of the people  was in favour of federation, and all the States consented to the terms  thereof. Now if the Transvaal and the Orange River Colonies, communities  that have enjoyed a form of self-government in the past, had not free  choice of assent or refusal, and joined the South African Federation  under compulsion (no matter how slight a measure of compulsion),  constitutional difficulties might spring up in the hereafter. Disputes  might arise between the federal authority and these two States, and they  would say, 'We were not asked for our consent, we had not complete  freedom of choice.' In any case, representation must be given to them,  and it would be awkward if two out of the five Federal States or  Provinces were trying to overthrow the federation. I do not say this  would happen, but the possibility of such an emergency should be  seriously considered. It would be safe, I think, to work and wait for a  majority in favour of federation; more especially as there has existed  and still exists, as I am informed, a strong feeling that the interests  of both peoples in South Africa would be furthered by such a measure.\"      IV    Neither Mr. Seddon nor Sir Wilfrid Laurier granted the writer's request  for an expression of opinion in regard to the possibility or probability  of South African Federation. Mr. Seddon, though he is always ready to  advise the various Provinces of the Empire in commercial matters, is  averse to interfering in other people's politics. Moreover the word  \"federation\" has a discomfortable sound in the ears of his New Zealand  constituents; to a few it suggests Rossetti's \"might-have-been,\" to most  its echo is a more or less decided \"certainly not.\"    Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who has suffered much from the too imaginative  interviewer, both in the United States and in France, makes it a  principle not to be interviewed. But a day or two after he had  courteously declined to grant the writer's request, he was good enough  to allude to the subject of South African Federation in a speech at  Edinburgh, from which the following excerpt is taken: \"In my humble  opinion,\" said the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#7)"],[1,"gy, gray eyebrows, they pierced him  through at the first glance. Keith took in the carefully waxed gray  mustaches, the close-cropped gray hair, the rigidly set muscles of the  man's face, and saluted.    He felt creeping over him a slow chill. There was no greeting in that  iron-like countenance, for full a quarter-minute no sign of  recognition. And then, as the sun had played in the girl's hair, a new  emotion passed over McDowell's face, and Keith saw for the first time  the man whom Derwent Conniston had known as a friend as well as a  superior. He rose from his chair, and leaning over the table said in a  voice in which were mingled both amazement and pleasure:    \"We were just talking about the devil--and here you are, sir!  Conniston, how are you?\"    For a few moments Keith did not see. HE HAD WON! The blood pounded  through his heart so violently that it confused his vision and his  senses. He felt the grip of McDowell's hand; he heard his voice; a  vision swam before his eyes--and it was the vision of Derwent  Conniston's triumphant face. He was standing erect, his head was up, he  was meeting McDowell shoulder to shoulder, even smiling, but in that  swift surge of exultation he did not know. McDowell, still gripping his  hand and with his other hand on his arm, was wheeling him about, and he  found the girl on her feet, staring at him as if he had newly risen  from the dead.    McDowell's military voice was snapping vibrantly, \"Conniston, meet Miss  Miriam Kirkstone, daughter of Judge Kirkstone!\"    He bowed and held for a moment in his own the hand of the girl whose  father he had killed. It was lifeless and cold. Her lips moved, merely  speaking his name. His own were mute. McDowell was saying something  about the glory of the service and the sovereignty of the law. And  then, breaking in like the beat of a drum on the introduction, his  voice demanded, \"Conniston--DID YOU GET YOUR MAN?\"    The question brought Keith to his senses. He inclined his head slightly  and said, \"I beg to report that John Keith is dead, sir.\"    He saw Miriam Kirkstone give a visible start, as if his words had  carried a stab. She was apparently making a strong effort to hide her  agitation as she turned swiftly away from him, speaking to McDowell.    \"You have been very kind, Inspector McDowell. I hope very soon to have  the pleasure of talking with Mr. Conniston--about--John Keith.\"    She left them, nodding slightly to Keith.    When she was gone, a puzzled look filled the Inspector's eyes. \"She has  been like that for the last six months,\" he explained. \"Tremendously  interested in this man Keith and his fate. I don't believe that I have  watched for your return more anxiously than she has, Conniston. And the  curious part of it is she seemed to have no interest in the matter at  all until six months ago. Sometimes I am afraid that brooding over her  father's death has unsettled her a little. A mighty pretty girl,  Conniston. A mighty pretty girl, indeed! And her brother is a skunk.  Pst! You haven't forgotten him?\"    He drew a chair up close to his own and motioned Keith to be seated.  \"You're changed, Conniston!\"    The words came out of him like a shot. So unexpected were they that  Keith felt the effect of them in every nerve of his body. He sensed  instantly what McDowell meant. He was NOT like the Englishman; he  lacked his mannerisms, his cool and superior suavity, the inimitable  quality of his nerve and sportsmanship. Even as he met the disquieting  directness of the Inspector's eyes, he could see Conniston sitting in  his place, rolling his mustache between his forefinger and thumb, and  smiling as though he had gone into the north but yesterday and had  returned today. That was what McDowell was missing in him, the soul of  Conniston himself--Conniston, the ne plus ultra of presence and amiable  condescension, the man who could look the Inspector or the High  Commissioner himself between the eyes, and, serenely indifferent to  Service regulations, say, \"Fine morning, old top!\" Keith was not  without his own sense of humor. How the Englishman's ghost must be  raging if it was in the room at the present moment! He grinned and  shrugged his shoulders.    \"Were you ever up there--through the Long Night--alone?\" he asked.  \"Ever been through six months of living torture with the stars leering  at you and the foxes barking at you all the time, fighting to keep  yourself from going mad? I went through that twice to get John Keith,  and I guess you're right. I'm changed. I don't think I'll ever be the  same again. Something--has gone. I can't tell what it is, but I feel  it. I guess only half of me pulled through. It killed John Keith.  Rotten, isn't it?\"    He felt that he had made a lucky stroke. McDowell pulled out a drawer  from under the table and thrust a box of fat cigars under his nose.    \"Light up, Derry--light up and tell us what happened. Bless my soul,  you're not half dead! A week in the old town will straighten you out.\"    He struck a match and held it to the tip of Keith's cigar.    For an hour thereafter Keith told the story of the man-hunt. It was his  Iliad. He could feel the presence of Conniston as words fell from his  lips; he forgot the presence of the stern-faced man who was watching  him and listening to him; he could see once more only the long months  and years of that epic drama of one against one, of pursuit and flight,  of hunger and cold, of the Long Nights filled with the desolation of  madness and despair. He triumphed over himself, and it was Conniston  who spoke from within him. It was the Englishman who told how terribly  John Keith had been punished, and when he came to the final days in the  lonely little cabin in the edge of the Barrens, Keith finished with a  choking in his throat, and the words, \"And that was how John Keith  died--a gentleman and a MAN!\"    He was thinking of the Englishman, of the calm and fearless smile in  his eyes as he died, of his last words, the last friendly grip of his  hand, and McDowell saw the thing as though he had faced it himself. He  brushed a hand over his face as if to wipe away a film. For some  moments after Keith had finished, he stood with his back to the man who  he thought was Conniston, and his mind was swiftly adding twos and twos  and fours and fours as he looked away into the green valley of the  Saskatchewan. He was the iron man when he turned to Keith again, the  law itself, merciless and potent, by some miracle turned into the form  of human flesh.    \"After two and a half years of THAT even a murderer must have seemed  like a saint to you, Conniston. You have done your work splendidly. The  whole story shall go to the Department, and if it doesn't bring you a  commission, I'll resign. But we must continue to regret that John Keith  did not live to be hanged.\"    \"He has paid the price,\" said Keith dully.    \"No, he has not paid the price, not in full. He merely died. It could  have been paid only at the end of a rope. His crime was atrociously  brutal, the culmination of a fiend's desire for revenge. We will wipe  off his name. But I can not wipe away the regret. I would sacrifice a  year of my life if he were in this room with you now. It would be worth  it. God, what a thing for the Service--to have brought John Keith back  to justice after four years!\"    He was rubbing his hands and smiling at Keith even as he spoke. His  eyes had taken on a filmy glitter. The law! It stood there, without  heart or soul, coveting the life that had escaped it. A feeling of  revulsion swept over Keith.    A knock came at the door.    McDowell's voice gave permission, and the door slowly opened. Cruze,  the young secretary, thrust in his head.    \"Shan Tung is waiting, sir,\" he said.    An invisible hand reached up suddenly and gripped at Keith's throat. He  turned aside to conceal what his face might have betrayed. Shan Tung!  He knew what it was now that had pulled him back, he knew why  Conniston's troubled face had traveled with him over the Barrens, and  there surged over him with a sickening foreboding, a realization of  what it was that Conniston had remembered and wanted to tell him--when  it was too late. THEY HAD FORGOTTEN SHAN TUNG, THE CHINAMAN!          VI      In the hall beyond the secretary's room Shan Tung waited. As McDowell  was the iron and steel embodiment of the law, so Shan Tung was the  flesh and blood spirit of the mysticism and immutability of his race.  His face was the face of an image made of an unemotional living tissue  in place of wood or stone, dispassionate, tolerant, patient. What  passed in the brain behind his yellow-tinged eyes only Shan Tung knew.  It was his secret. And McDowell had ceased to analyze or attempt to  understand him. The law, baffled in its curiosity, had come to accept  him as a weird and wonderful mechanism--a thing more than a  man--possessed of an unholy power. This power was the oriental's  marvelous ability to remember faces. Once Shan Tung looked at a face,  it was photographed in his memory for years. Time and change could not  make him forget--and the law made use of him.    Briefly McDowell had classified him at Headquarters. \"Either an exiled  prime minister of China or the devil in a yellow skin,\" he had written  to the Commissioner. \"Correct age unknown and past history a mystery.  Dropped into Prince Albert in 1908 wearing diamonds and patent leather  shoes. A stranger then and a stranger now. Proprietor and owner of the  Shan Tung Cafe. Educated, soft-spoken, womanish, but the one man on  earth I'd hate to be in a dark room with, knives drawn. I use him,  mistrust him, watch him, and would fear him under certain conditions.  As far as we can discover, he is harmless and law-abiding. But such a  ferret must surely have played his game somewhere, at some time.\"    This was the man whom Conniston had forgotten and Keith now dreaded to  meet. For many minutes Shan Tung"]]]
