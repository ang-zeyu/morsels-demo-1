Flavour it  with a tea-spoonful of rose-water or eight drops of essence of  lemon, stirred in at the last. Spread it evenly with a broad  knife, over the top of each queen-cake, ornamenting them, (while  the icing is quite wet) with red and green nonpareils, or fine  sugar-sand, dropped on, carefully, with the thumb and finger.    When the cakes are iced, set them in a warm place to dry; but not  too near the fire, as that will cause the icing to crack.  [Footnote: You may colour icing of a fine pink, by mixing with it  a few drops of liquid cochineal; which is prepared by boiling very  slowly in an earthen or china vessel twenty grains of cochineal  powder, twenty grains of cream of tartar, and twenty grains of  powdered alum, all dissolved in a gill of soft water, and boiled  till reduced to one half. Strain it and cork it up in a small  phial. Pink icing should be ornamented with white nonpareils.]      POUND CAKE.      One pound of flour, sifted.    One pound of white sugar, powdered and sifted.    One pound of fresh butter.    Ten eggs.    Half a glass of wine       \\    Half a glass of brandy      }mixed.    Half a glass of rose-water /    Twelve drops of essence of lemon.    A table-spoonful of mixed mace and cinnamon.    A nutmeg, powdered.    Pound the spice and sift it. There should be twice as much  cinnamon as mace. Mix the cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg together.    Sift the flour in a broad pan, or wooden bowl. Sift the powdered  sugar into a large deep pan, and cut the butter into it, in small  pieces. If the weather is very cold, and the butter hard, set the  pan near the fire for a few minutes; but if the butter is too  warm, the cake will be heavy. Stir the butter and sugar together,  with a wooden stick, till they are very light, and white, and look  like cream.    Beat the eggs in a broad shallow pan with a wood egg-beater or  whisk. They must be beaten till they are thick and smooth, and of  the consistence of boiled custard.    Pour the liquor and rose-water, gradually, into the butter and  sugar, stirring all the time. Add, by degrees, the essence of  lemon and spice.    Stir the egg and flour alternately into the butter and sugar, a  handful of flour, and about two spoonfuls of the egg (which you  must continue to beat all the time,) and when all is in, stir the  whole mixture very hard, for near ten minutes.    Butter a large tin pan, or a cake mould with an open tube rising  from the middle. Put the mixture into it as evenly as possible.  Bake it in a moderate oven, for two, or three, or four hours, in  proportion to its thickness, and to the heat of the fire.    When you think it is nearly done, thrust a twig or wooden skewer  into it, down to the bottom. If the stick come out clean and dry,  the cake is almost baked. When quite done, it will shrink from she  sides of the pan, and cease making a noise. Then withdraw the  coals (if baked in a dutch oven), take off the lid, and let the  cake remain in the oven to cool gradually.    You may ice it either warm or cold. Before you put the icing on a  large cake, dredge the cake all over with flour, and then wipe the  flour off; this will make the icing stick on better--If you have  sufficient time, the appearance of the cake will be much improved  by icing it twice. Put on the first icing soon after the cake is  taken out of the oven, and the second the next day when the first  is perfectly dry. While the last icing is wet, ornament it with  coloured sugar-sand or nonpareils.      BLACK CAKE, OR PLUM CAKE.      One pound of flour sifted.    One pound of fresh butter.    One pound of powdered white sugar.    Twelve eggs.    Two pounds of the best raisins.    Two pounds of currants.    Two table-spoonfuls of mixed spice, mace and cinnamon.    Two nutmegs powdered.    A large glass of wine      \\    A large glass of brandy     }mixed together.    Half a glass of rose-water /    A pound of citron.    Pick the currants very clean, and wash them, draining them through  a colander. Wipe them in a towel. Spread them out on a large dish,  and set them near the fire, or in the hot sun, to dry, placing the  dish in a slanting position. Having stoned the raisins, cut them  in half, and, when all are done, sprinkle them well with sifted  flour, to prevent their sinking to the bottom of the cake. When  the currants are dry, sprinkle them also with flour.    Pound the spice, allowing twice as much cinnamon as mace. Sift it,  and mix the mace, nutmeg, cinnamon together. Mix also the liquor  and rose-water in a tumbler or cup. Cut the citron in slips. Sift  the flour into a broad dish. Sift the sugar into a deep earthen  pan, and cut the butter into it. Warm it near the fire, if the  weather is too cold for it to mix easily. Stir the butter and  sugar to a cream.    Beat the eggs as light as possible. Stir them into the butter and  sugar, alternately with the flour. Stir very hard. Add gradually  the spice and liquor. Stir the raisins and currants alternately  into the mixture, taking care that they are well floured. Stir the  whole as hard as possible, for ten minutes after the ingredients  are in.    Cover the bottom and sides of a large tin or earthen pan, with  sheets of white paper well buttered, and put into it some of the  mixture. Then spread on it some of the citron, which must not be  cut too small. Next put a layer of the mixture, and then a layer  of citron, and so on till it is all in, having a layer of the  mixture at the top.    This cake is always best baked in a baker's oven, and will require  four or five hours, in proportion to its thickness. [Footnote:  After this cake is done, it will be the better for withdrawing the  fire (if baked in an iron oven) and letting it stay in the oven  all night, or till it gets quite cold.] Ice it the next day.      SPONGE CAKE.      Twelve eggs.    Ten ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire.    A pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.    Twelve drops of essence of lemon.    A grated nutmeg.    A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon and mace, mixed.    Beat the eggs as light as possible. Eggs for sponge or almond  cakes require more beating than for any other purpose. Beat the  sugar, by degrees, into the eggs. Beat very hard, and continue to  beat some time after the sugar is all in.    No sort of sugar but loaf will make light sponge-cake. Stir in,  gradually, the spice and essence of lemon. Then, by degrees, put  in the flour, a little at a time, stirring round the mixture very  slowly with a knife. If the flour is stirred in too hard, the cake  will be tough. It must be done lightly and gently, so that the top  of the mixture will be covered with bubbles. As soon as the flour  is all in, begin to bake it, as setting will injure it.    Put it in small tins, well buttered, or in one large tin pan. The  thinner the pans, the better for sponge-cake. Fill the small tins  about half full. Grate loaf-sugar over the top of each, before you  set them in the oven.    Sponge-cake requires a very quick oven, particularly at the  bottom. It should be baked as fast as possible, or it will be  tough and heavy, however light it may have been before it went  into the oven. It is of all cakes the most liable to be spoiled in  baking. When taken out of the tins, the cakes should be spread on  a sieve to cool. If baked in one large cake, it should be iced.    A large cake of twelve eggs, should be baked at least an hour in a  quick oven.    For small cakes, ten minutes is generally sufficient. If they get  very much out of shape in baking, it is a sign that the oven is  too slow.    Some think that sponge-cakes and almond cakes are lighter, when  the yolks and whites of the eggs are beaten in separate pans, and  mixed gently together before the sugar is beaten into them.    If done separately from the yolks, the whites should be beaten  till they stand alone.      ALMOND CAKE      Two ounces of blanched bitter almonds, pounded very fine.    Seven ounces of flour, sifted and dried.    Ten eggs.    One pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.    Two table-spoonfuls of rose-water.    Take two ounces of shelled bitter almonds or peach-kernels. Scald  them in hot water, and as you peel them, throw them into a bowl of  cold water, then wipe them dry, and pound them one by one in a  mortar, till they are quite fine and smooth.    Break ten eggs, putting the yolks in one pan and the whites in  another. Beat them separately as light as possible, the whites  first, and then the yolks.    Add the sugar, gradually, to the yolks, beating it in very hard.  Then by degrees, Beat in the almonds, and then add the rose-water.    Stir-half the whites of the eggs into the yolks and sugar. Divide  the flour into two equal parts, and stir in one half, slowly and  lightly, till it bubbles on the top. Then the other half of the  white of egg, and then the remainder of the flour very lightly.    Butter a large square tin pan, or one made of paste-board which  will be better. Put in the mixture, and set immediately in a quick  oven, which must be rather hotter at the bottom than at the top.  Bake it according to the thickness. If you allow the oven to get  slack, the cake will be spoiled.    Make an icing with the whites of three eggs, twenty-four  tea-spoonfuls of loaf-sugar, and eight drops of essence of lemon.    When the cake is cool, mark it in small squares with a knife.  Cover it with icing, and ornament it while wet, with nonpareils  dropped on in borders, round each square of the cake. When the  icing is dry, cut the cake in squares, cutting through the icing  very carefully with a penknife. Or you may cat it in squares  first, and then ice and ornament each square separately.      FRENCH ALMOND CAKE.      Six ounces of shelled sweet almonds.    Three ounces of shelled bitter almonds, or peach-kernels.    Three ounces of sifted flour,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6684"],[0,"Uneasy Money (#7)"],[1,"III,  AUS to BIS, you will find that bees are a 'large and natural  family of the zoological order Hymenoptera, characterized by the  plumose form of many of their hairs, by the large size of the  basal segment of the foot ... and by the development of a \"tongue\"  for sucking liquid food,' the last of which peculiarities, it is  interesting to note, they shared with Claude Nutcombe Boyd,  Elizabeth's brother, who for quite a long time--till his money ran  out--had made liquid food almost his sole means of sustenance.  These things, however, are by the way. We are not such snobs as to  think better or worse of a bee because it can claim kinship with  the _Hymenoptera_ family, nor so ill-bred as to chaff it for  having large feet. The really interesting passage in the article  occurs later, where it says: 'The bee industry prospers greatly in  America.'    This is one of those broad statements that invite challenge.  Elizabeth Boyd would have challenged it. She had not prospered  greatly. With considerable trouble she contrived to pay her way,  and that was all.    Again referring to the 'Encyclopaedia,' we find the words: 'Before  undertaking the management of a modern apiary, the beekeeper  should possess a certain amount of aptitude for the pursuit.' This  was possibly the trouble with Elizabeth's venture, considered from  a commercial point of view. She loved bees, but she was not an  expert on them. She had started her apiary with a small capital, a  book of practical hints, and a second-hand queen, principally  because she was in need of some occupation that would enable her  to live in the country. It was the unfortunate condition of Claude  Nutcombe which made life in the country a necessity. At that time  he was spending the remains of the money left him by his aunt, and  Elizabeth had hardly settled down at Brookport and got her venture  under way when she found herself obliged to provide for Nutty a  combination of home and sanatorium. It had been the poor lad's  mistaken view that he could drink up all the alcoholic liquor in  America.    It is a curious law of Nature that the most undeserving brothers  always have the best sisters. Thrifty, plodding young men, who get  up early, and do it now, and catch the employer's eye, and save  half their salaries, have sisters who never speak civilly to them  except when they want to borrow money. To the Claude Nutcombes of  the world are vouchsafed the Elizabeths.    The great aim of Elizabeth's life was to make a new man of Nutty.  It was her hope that the quiet life and soothing air of Brookport,  with--unless you counted the money-in-the-slot musical box at the  store--its absence of the fiercer excitements, might in time pull  him together and unscramble his disordered nervous system. She  liked to listen of a morning to the sound of Nutty busy in the  next room with a broom and a dustpan, for in the simple lexicon of  Flack's there was no such word as 'help'. The privy purse would  not run to a maid. Elizabeth did the cooking and Claude Nutcombe  the housework.    Several days after Claire Fenwick and Lord Dawlish, by different  routes, had sailed from England, Elizabeth Boyd sat up in bed and  shook her mane of hair from her eyes, yawning. Outside her window  the birds were singing, and a shaft of sunlight intruded itself  beneath the blind. But what definitely convinced her that it was  time to get up was the plaintive note of James, the cat,  patrolling the roof of the porch. An animal of regular habits,  James always called for breakfast at eight-thirty sharp.    Elizabeth got out of bed, wrapped her small body in a pink kimono,  thrust her small feet into a pair of blue slippers, yawned again,  and went downstairs. Having taken last night's milk from the ice-box,  she went to the back door, and, having filled James's saucer,  stood on the grass beside it, sniffing the morning air.    Elizabeth Boyd was twenty-one, but standing there with her hair  tumbling about her shoulders she might have been taken by a  not-too-close observer for a child. It was only when you saw her eyes  and the resolute tilt of the chin that you realized that she was a  young woman very well able to take care of herself in a difficult  world. Her hair was very fair, her eyes brown and very bright, and  the contrast was extraordinarily piquant. They were valiant eyes,  full of spirit; eyes, also, that saw the humour of things. And her  mouth was the mouth of one who laughs easily. Her chin, small like  the rest of her, was strong; and in the way she held herself there  was a boyish jauntiness. She looked--and was--a capable little  person.    She stood besides James like a sentinel, watching over him as he  breakfasted. There was a puppy belonging to one of the neighbours  who sometimes lumbered over and stole James's milk, disposing of  it in greedy gulps while its rightful proprietor looked on with  piteous helplessness. Elizabeth was fond of the puppy, but her  sense of justice was keen and she was there to check this  brigandage.    It was a perfect day, cloudless and still. There was peace in the  air. James, having finished his milk, began to wash himself. A  squirrel climbed cautiously down from a linden tree. From the  orchard came the murmur of many bees.    Aesthetically Elizabeth was fond of still, cloudless days, but  experience had taught her to suspect them. As was the custom in  that locality, the water supply depended on a rickety windwheel.  It was with a dark foreboding that she returned to the kitchen and  turned on one of the taps. For perhaps three seconds a stream of  the dimension of a darning-needle emerged, then with a sad gurgle  the tap relapsed into a stolid inaction. There is no stolidity so  utter as that of a waterless tap.    'Confound it!' said Elizabeth.    She passed through the dining-room to the foot of the stairs.    'Nutty!'    There was no reply.    'Nutty, my precious lamb!'    Upstairs in the room next to her own a long, spare form began to  uncurl itself in bed; a face with a receding chin and a small  forehead raised itself reluctantly from the pillow, and Claude  Nutcombe Boyd signalized the fact that he was awake by scowling at  the morning sun and uttering an aggrieved groan.    Alas, poor Nutty! This was he whom but yesterday Broadway had  known as the Speed Kid, on whom head-waiters had smiled and lesser  waiters fawned; whose snake-like form had nestled in so many a  front-row orchestra stall.    Where were his lobster Newburgs now, his cold quarts that were  wont to set the table in a roar?    Nutty Boyd conformed as nearly as a human being may to Euclid's  definition of a straight line. He was length without breadth. From  boyhood's early day he had sprouted like a weed, till now in the  middle twenties he gave startled strangers the conviction that it  only required a sharp gust of wind to snap him in half. Lying in  bed, he looked more like a length of hose-pipe than anything else.  While he was unwinding himself the door opened and Elizabeth came  into the room.    'Good morning, Nutty!'    'What's the time?' asked her brother, hollowly.    'Getting on towards nine. It's a lovely day. The birds are  singing, the bees are buzzing, summer's in the air. It's one of  those beautiful, shiny, heavenly, gorgeous days.'    A look of suspicion came into Nutty's eyes. Elizabeth was not  often as lyrical as this.    'There's a catch somewhere,' he said.    'Well, as a matter of fact,' said Elizabeth, carelessly, 'the  water's off again.'    'Confound it!'    'I said that. I'm afraid we aren't a very original family.'    'What a ghastly place this is! Why can't you see old Flack and  make him mend that infernal wheel?'    'I'm going to pounce on him and have another try directly I see  him. Meanwhile, darling Nutty, will you get some clothes on and go  round to the Smiths and ask them to lend us a pailful?'    'Oh, gosh, it's over a mile!'    'No, no, not more than three-quarters.'    'Lugging a pail that weighs a ton! The last time I went there  their dog bit me.'    'I expect that was because you slunk in all doubled up, and he got  suspicious. You should hold your head up and throw your chest out  and stride up as if you were a military friend of the family.'    Self-pity lent Nutty eloquence.    'For Heaven's sake! You drag me out of bed at some awful hour of  the morning when a rational person would just be turning in; you  send me across country to fetch pailfuls of water when I'm feeling  like a corpse; and on top of that you expect me to behave like a  drum-major!'    'Dearest, you can wriggle on your tummy, if you like, so long as  you get the fluid. We must have water. I can't fetch it. I'm a  delicately-nurtured female.'    'We ought to have a man to do these ghastly jobs.'    'But we can't afford one. Just at present all I ask is to be able  to pay expenses. And, as a matter of fact, you ought to be very  thankful that you have got--'    'A roof over my head? I know. You needn't keep rubbing it in.'    Elizabeth flushed.    'I wasn't going to say that at all. What a pig you are sometimes,  Nutty. As if I wasn't only too glad to have you here. What I was  going to say was that you ought to be very thankful that you have  got to draw water and hew wood--'    A look of absolute alarm came into Nutty's pallid face.    'You don't mean to say that you want some wood chopped?'    'I was speaking figuratively. I meant hustle about and work in the  open air. The sort of life you are leading now is what millionaires  pay hundreds of dollars for at these physical-culture places. It  has been the making of you.'    'I don't feel made.'    'Your nerves are ever so much better.'    'They aren't.'    Elizabeth looked at him in alarm.    'Oh, Nutty, you haven't been--seeing anything again, have you?'    'Not seeing, dreaming. I've been dreaming about monkeys. Why  should I dream about monkeys if my nerves were all right?'    'I"]]]
