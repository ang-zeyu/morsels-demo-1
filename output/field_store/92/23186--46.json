Parties are constituted  in order to acquire the conquest of these  employments, and they are analogous to the State.''[10]      [10] La Decomposition du Marxisme,'' p. 53.      Syndicalists aim at organizing men, not by party,  but by occupation. This, they say, alone represents  the true conception and method of the class war.  Accordingly they despise all POLITICAL action through  the medium of Parliament and elections: the kind of  action that they recommend is direct action by the  revolutionary syndicate or trade union. The battle-  cry of industrial versus political action has spread  far beyond the ranks of French Syndicalism. It is  to be found in the I. W. W. in America, and among  Industrial Unionists and Guild Socialists in Great  Britain. Those who advocate it, for the most part,  aim also at a different goal from that of Marx. They  believe that there can be no adequate individual  freedom where the State is all-powerful, even if the  State be a Socialist one. Some of them are out-and-  out Anarchists, who wish to see the State wholly  abolished; others only wish to curtail its authority.  Owing to this movement, opposition to Marx, which  from the Anarchist side existed from the first, has  grown very strong. It is this opposition in its older  form that will occupy us in our next chapter.        CHAPTER II    BAKUNIN AND ANARCHISM      IN the popular mind, an Anarchist is a person  who throws bombs and commits other outrages,  either because he is more or less insane, or because  he uses the pretense of extreme political opinions as  a cloak for criminal proclivities. This view is, of  course, in every way inadequate. Some Anarchists  believe in throwing bombs; many do not. Men of  almost every other shade of opinion believe in throwing  bombs in suitable circumstances: for example,  the men who threw the bomb at Sarajevo which  started the present war were not Anarchists, but  Nationalists. And those Anarchists who are in  favor of bomb-throwing do not in this respect differ  on any vital principle from the rest of the community,  with the exception of that infinitesimal portion  who adopt the Tolstoyan attitude of non-resistance.  Anarchists, like Socialists, usually believe  in the doctrine of the class war, and if they use  bombs, it is as Governments use bombs, for purposes  of war: but for every bomb manufactured by an  Anarchist, many millions are manufactured by Governments,  and for every man killed by Anarchist  violence, many millions are killed by the violence of  States. We may, therefore, dismiss from our minds  the whole question of violence, which plays so large  a part in the popular imagination, since it is neither  essential nor peculiar to those who adopt the Anarchist  position.    Anarchism, as its derivation indicates, is the  theory which is opposed to every kind of forcible  government. It is opposed to the State as the  embodiment of the force employed in the government  of the community. Such government as Anarchism  can tolerate must be free government, not merely in  the sense that it is that of a majority, but in the sense  that it is that assented to by all. Anarchists object  to such institutions as the police and the criminal  law, by means of which the will of one part of the  community is forced upon another part. In their  view, the democratic form of government is not very  enormously preferable to other forms so long as  minorities are compelled by force or its potentiality  to submit to the will of majorities. Liberty is the  supreme good in the Anarchist creed, and liberty  is sought by the direct road of abolishing all forcible  control over the individual by the community.    Anarchism, in this sense, is no new doctrine. It  is set forth admirably by Chuang Tzu, a Chinese philosopher,  who lived about the year 300 B. C.:--    Horses have hoofs to carry them over frost and snow;  hair, to protect them from wind and cold. They eat grass  and drink water, and fling up their heels over the champaign.  Such is the real nature of horses. Palatial  dwellings are of no use to them.    One day Po Lo appeared, saying: ``I understand the  management of horses.''    So he branded them, and clipped them, and pared  their hoofs, and put halters on them, tying them up by  the head and shackling them by the feet, and disposing  them in stables, with the result that two or three in  every ten died. Then he kept them hungry and thirsty,  trotting them and galloping them, and grooming, and  trimming, with the misery of the tasselled bridle before  and the fear of the knotted whip behind, until more than  half of them were dead.    The potter says: ``I can do what I will with Clay.  If I want it round, I use compasses; if rectangular, a  square.''    The carpenter says: ``I can do what I will with  wood. If I want it curved, I use an arc; if straight, a  line.''    But on what grounds can we think that the natures  of clay and wood desire this application of compasses and  square, of arc and line? Nevertheless, every age extols  Po Lo for his skill in managing horses, and potters and  carpenters for their skill with clay and wood. Those  who govern the empire make the same mistake.    Now I regard government of the empire from quite  a different point of view.    The people have certain natural instincts:--to weave  and clothe themselves, to till and feed themselves. These  are common to all humanity, and all are agreed thereon.  Such instincts are called ``Heaven-sent.''    And so in the days when natural instincts prevailed,  men moved quietly and gazed steadily. At that time  there were no roads over mountains, nor boats, nor  bridges over water. All things were produced, each for  its own proper sphere. Birds and beasts multiplied,  trees and shrubs grew up. The former might be led by  the hand; you could climb up and peep into the raven's  nest. For then man dwelt with birds and beasts, and  all creation was one. There were no distinctions of good  and bad men. Being all equally without knowledge,  their virtue could not go astray. Being all equally  without evil desires, they were in a state of natural  integrity, the perfection of human existence.    But when Sages appeared, tripping up people over  charity and fettering them with duty to their neighbor,  doubt found its way into the world. And then, with  their gushing over music and fussing over ceremony, the  empire became divided against itself.[11]      [11] ``Musings of a Chinese Mystic.''

The modern Anarchism, in the sense in which we  shall be concerned with it, is associated with belief  in the communal ownership of land and capital, and  is thus in an important respect akin to Socialism.  This doctrine is properly called Anarchist Com-  munism, but as it embraces practically all modern  Anarchism, we may ignore individualist Anarchism  altogether and concentrate attention upon the  communistic form. Socialism and Anarchist Communism  alike have arisen from the perception that private  capital is a source of tyranny by certain individuals  over others. Orthodox Socialism believes that the  individual will become free if the State becomes the  sole capitalist. Anarchism, on the contrary, fears  that in that case the State might merely inherit the  tyrannical propensities of the private capitalist.  Accordingly, it seeks for a means of reconciling communal  ownership with the utmost possible diminution  in the powers of the State, and indeed ultimately with  the complete abolition of the State. It has arisen  mainly within the Socialist movement as its extreme  left wing.    In the same sense in which Marx may be regarded  as the founder of modern Socialism, Bakunin may  be regarded as the founder of Anarchist Communism.  But Bakunin did not produce, like Marx, a finished  and systematic body of doctrine. The nearest  approach to this will be found in the writings of his  follower, Kropotkin. In order to explain modern  Anarchism we shall begin with the life of Bakunin[12]  and the history of his conflicts with Marx, and shall  then give a brief account of Anarchist theory as set  forth partly in his writings, but more in those of  Kropotkin.[13]    [12] An account of the life of Bakunin from the Anarchist  standpoint will be found in vol. ii of the complete edition of  his works: ``Michel Bakounine, OEuvres,'' Tome II. Avec une  notice biographique, des avant-propos et des notes, par James  Guillaume. Paris, P.-V, Stock, editeur, pp. v-lxiii.    [13] Criticism of these theories will be reserved for Part II.      Michel Bakunin was born in 1814 of a Russian  aristocratic family. His father was a diplomatist,  who at the time of Bakunin's birth had retired to his  country estate in the Government of Tver. Bakunin  entered the school of artillery in Petersburg at the  age of fifteen, and at the age of eighteen was sent as  an ensign to a regiment stationed in the Government  of Minsk. The Polish insurrection of 1880 had just  been crushed. ``The spectacle of terrorized Poland,''  says Guillaume, ``acted powerfully on the heart of  the young officer, and contributed to inspire in him  the horror of despotism.'' This led him to give up  the military career after two years' trial. In 1834  he resigned his commission and went to Moscow,  where he spent six years studying philosophy. Like  all philosophical students of that period, he became  a Hegelian, and in 1840 he went to Berlin to continue  his studies, in the hope of ultimately becoming a  professor. But after this time his opinions underwent  a rapid change. He found it impossible to  accept the Hegelian maxim that whatever is, is  rational, and in 1842 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#7)"],[1,"that he had still been there at,  so to speak, the close of play. As a matter of fact, Albert was in  excellent shape, and only an unfortunate previous engagement prevented  him from ranging the streets near Cook's as before. Sir William Bruce  was addressing a meeting in another part of the town, and Albert  thought it his duty to be on hand to boo.    In the junior portion of the school the feud with the town was brisk.  Mention has been made of a certain St Jude's, between which seat of  learning and the fags of Dexter's and the School House there was a  spirited vendetta.    Jackson, of Dexter's was one of the pillars of the movement. Jackson  was                       a calm-brow'd lad,      Yet mad, at moments, as a hatter,    and he derived a great deal of pleasure from warring against St Jude's.  It helped him to enjoy his meals. He slept the better for it. After a  little turn up with a Judy he was fuller of that spirit of manly  fortitude and forbearance so necessary to those whom Fate brought  frequently into contact with Mr Dexter. The Judies wore mortar-boards,  and it was an enjoyable pastime sending these spinning into space  during one of the usual _rencontres_ in the High Street. From the  fact that he and his friends were invariably outnumbered, there was a  sporting element in these affairs, though occasionally this inferiority  of numbers was the cause of his executing a scientific retreat with the  enemy harassing his men up to the very edge of the town. This had  happened on the last occasion. There had been casualties. No fewer than  six house-caps had fallen into the enemy's hands, and he himself had  been tripped up and rolled in a puddle.    He burned to avenge this disaster.    \"Coming down to Cook's?\" he said to his ally, Painter. It was just a  week since the Sheen episode.    \"All right,\" said Painter.    \"Suppose we go by the High Street,\" suggested Jackson, casually.    \"Then we'd better get a few more chaps,\" said Painter.    A few more chaps were collected, and the party, numbering eight, set  off for the town. There were present such stalwarts as Borwick and  Crowle, both of Dexter's, and Tomlin, of the School House, a useful man  to have by you in an emergency. It was Tomlin who, on one occasion,  attacked by two terrific champions of St Jude's in a narrow passage,  had vanquished them both, and sent their mortar-boards miles into the  empyrean, so that they were never the same mortar-boards again, but  wore ever after a bruised and draggled look.    The expedition passed down the High Street without adventure, until, by  common consent, it stopped at the lofty wall which bounded the  playground of St Jude's.    From the other side of the wall came sounds of revelry, shrill  squealings and shoutings. The Judies were disporting themselves at one  of their weird games. It was known that they played touch-last, and  Scandal said that another of their favourite recreations was marbles.  The juniors at Wrykyn believed that it was to hide these excesses from  the gaze of the public that the playground wall had been made so high.  Eye-witnesses, who had peeped through the door in the said wall,  reported that what the Judies seemed to do mostly was to chase one  another about the playground, shrieking at the top of their voices.  But, they added, this was probably a mere ruse to divert suspicion.    They had almost certainly got the marbles in their pockets all the  time.    The expedition stopped, and looked itself in the face.    \"How about buzzing something at them?\" said Jackson earnestly.    \"You can get oranges over the road,\" said Tomlin in his helpful way.    Jackson vanished into the shop indicated, and reappeared a few moments  later with a brown paper bag.    \"It seems a beastly waste,\" suggested the economical Painter.    \"That's all right,\" said Jackson, \"they're all bad. The man thought I  was rotting him when I asked if he'd got any bad oranges, but I got  them at last. Give us a leg up, some one.\"    Willing hands urged him to the top of the wall. He drew out a green  orange, and threw it.    There was a sudden silence on the other side of the wall. Then a howl  of wrath went up to the heavens. Jackson rapidly emptied his bag.    \"Got him!\" he exclaimed, as the last orange sped on its way. \"Look out,  they're coming!\"    The expedition had begun to move off with quiet dignity, when from the  doorway in the wall there poured forth a stream of mortar-boarded  warriors, shrieking defiance. The expedition advanced to meet them.    As usual, the Judies had the advantage in numbers, and, filled to the  brim with righteous indignation, they were proceeding to make things  uncommonly warm for the invaders--Painter had lost his cap, and Tomlin  three waistcoat buttons--when the eye of Jackson, roving up and down  the street, was caught by a Seymour's cap. He was about to shout for  assistance when he perceived that the newcomer was Sheen, and  refrained. It was no use, he felt, asking Sheen for help.    But just as Sheen arrived and the ranks of the expedition were  beginning to give way before the strenuous onslaught of the Judies, the  latter, almost with one accord, turned and bolted into their playground  again. Looking round, Tomlin, that first of generals, saw the reason,  and uttered a warning.    A mutual foe had appeared. From a passage on the left of the road there  had debouched on to the field of action Albert himself and two of his  band.    The expedition flew without false shame. It is to be doubted whether  one of Albert's calibre would have troubled to attack such small game,  but it was the firm opinion of the Wrykyn fags and the Judies that he  and his men were to be avoided.    The newcomers did not pursue them. They contented themselves with  shouting at them. One of the band threw a stone.    Then they caught sight of Sheen.    Albert said, \"Oo er!\" and advanced at the double. His companions  followed him.    Sheen watched them come, and backed against the wall. His heart was  thumping furiously. He was in for it now, he felt. He had come down to  the town with this very situation in his mind. A wild idea of doing  something to restore his self-respect and his credit in the eyes of the  house had driven him to the High Street. But now that the crisis had  actually arrived, he would have given much to have been in his study  again.    Albert was quite close now. Sheen could see the marks which had  resulted from his interview with Drummond. With all his force Sheen hit  out, and experienced a curious thrill as his fist went home. It was a  poor blow from a scientific point of view, but Sheen's fives had given  him muscle, and it checked Albert. That youth, however, recovered  rapidly, and the next few moments passed in a whirl for Sheen. He  received a stinging blow on his left ear, and another which deprived  him of his whole stock of breath, and then he was on the ground,  conscious only of a wish to stay there for ever.          VII    MR JOE BEVAN      Almost involuntarily he staggered up to receive another blow which sent  him down again.    \"That'll do,\" said a voice.    Sheen got up, panting. Between him and his assailant stood a short,  sturdy man in a tweed suit. He was waving Albert back, and Albert  appeared to be dissatisfied. He was arguing hotly with the newcomer.    \"Now, you go away,\" said that worthy, mildly, \"just you go away.\"    Albert gave it as his opinion that the speaker would do well not to  come interfering in what didn't concern him. What he wanted, asserted  Albert, was a thick ear.    \"Coming pushing yourself in,\" added Albert querulously.    \"You go away,\" repeated the stranger. \"You go away. I don't want to  have trouble with you.\"    Albert's reply was to hit out with his left hand in the direction of  the speaker's face. The stranger, without fuss, touched the back of  Albert's wrist gently with the palm of his right hand, and Albert,  turning round in a circle, ended the manoeuvre with his back towards  his opponent. He faced round again irresolutely. The thing had  surprised him.    \"You go away,\" said the other, as if he were making the observation for  the first time.    \"It's Joe Bevan,\" said one of Albert's friends, excitedly.    Albert's jaw fell. His freckled face paled.    \"You go away,\" repeated the man in the tweed suit, whose conversation  seemed inclined to run in a groove.    This time Albert took the advice. His friends had already taken it.    \"Thanks,\" said Sheen.    \"Beware,\" said Mr Bevan oracularly, \"of entrance to a quarrel; but,  being in, bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Always counter  back when you guard. When a man shows you his right like that, always  push out your hand straight. The straight left rules the boxing world.  Feeling better, sir?\"    \"Yes, thanks.\"    \"He got that right in just on the spot. I was watching. When you see a  man coming to hit you with his right like that, don't you draw back.  Get on top of him. He can't hit you then.\"    That feeling of utter collapse, which is the immediate result of a blow  in the parts about the waistcoat, was beginning to pass away, and Sheen  now felt capable of taking an interest in sublunary matters once more.  His ear smarted horribly, and when he put up a hand and felt it the  pain was so great that he could barely refrain from uttering a cry.  But, however physically battered he might be, he was feeling happier  and more satisfied with himself than he had felt for years. He had been  beaten, but he had fought his best, and not given in. Some portion of  his self-respect came back to him as he reviewed the late encounter.    Mr Bevan regarded him approvingly.    \"He was too heavy for you,\" he said. \"He's a good twelve stone, I make  it. I should put you at ten stone--say ten stone three. Call it nine  stone twelve in condition. But you've got pluck, sir.\"    Sheen opened his eyes at this surprising statement.    \"Some I've"]]]
