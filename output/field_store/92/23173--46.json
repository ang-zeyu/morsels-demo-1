She was left  in charge of Lady Morton, whom the queen appointed her governess. Lady  Morton was young and beautiful. She was possessed of great strength  and energy of character, and she devoted herself with her whole soul  to preserving the life and securing the safety of her little charge.    The queen and her party had to traverse a wild and desolate forest,  many miles in extent, on the way to Plymouth. The name of it was  Dartmoor Forest. Lonely as it was, however, the party was safer in it  than in the open and inhabited country, which was all disturbed and  in commotion, as every country necessarily is in time of civil war.  As the queen drew near to Plymouth, she found that, for some reason,  it would not be safe to enter that town, and so the whole party went  on, continuing their journey farther to the westward still.    Now there is one important sea-port to the westward of Plymouth which  is called Falmouth, and near it, on a high promontory jutting into the  sea, is a large and strong castle, called Pendennis Castle. This castle  was, at the time of the queen's escape, in the hands of the king's  friends, and she determined, accordingly, to seek refuge there. The  whole party arrived here safely on the 29th of June. They were all  completely worn out and exhausted by the fatigues, privations, and  exposures of their terrible journey.    The queen had determined to make her escape as soon as possible to  France. She could no longer be of any service to the king in England;  her resources were exhausted, and her personal health was so feeble  that she must have been a burden to his cause, and not a help, if she  had remained. There was a ship from Holland in the harbor. The Prince  of Orange, it will be recollected, who had married the queen's oldest  daughter, was a prince of Holland, and this vessel was under his  direction. Some writers say it was sent to Falmouth by him to be ready  for his mother-in-law, in case she should wish to make her escape from  England. Others speak of it as being there accidentally at this time.  However this may be, it was immediately placed at Queen Henrietta's  disposal, and she determined to embark in it on the following morning.  She knew very well that, as soon as Essex should have heard of her  escape, parties would be scouring the country in all directions in  pursuit of her, and that, although the castle where she had found a  temporary refuge was strong, it was not best to incur the risk of being  shut up and besieged in it.    She accordingly embarked, with all her company, on board the Dutch  ship on the very morning after her arrival, and immediately put to  sea. They made all sail for the coast of France, intending to land at  Dieppe. Dieppe is almost precisely east of Falmouth, two or three  hundred miles from it, up the English Channel. As it is on the other  side of the Channel, it would lie to the south of Falmouth, were it  not that both the French and English coasts trend here to the northward.    Some time before they arrived at their port, they perceived some ships  in the offing that seemed to be pursuing them. They endeavored to  escape, but their pursuers gained rapidly upon them, and at length  fired a gun as a signal for the queen's vessel to stop. The ball came  bounding over the water toward them, but did no harm. Of course there  was a scene of universal commotion and panic on board the queen's ship.  Some wanted to fire back upon the pursuers, some wished to stop and  surrender, and others shrieked and cried, and were overwhelmed with  uncontrollable emotions of terror.    In the midst of this dreadful scene of confusion, the queen, as was  usual with her in such emergencies, retained all her self-possession,  and though weak and helpless before, felt a fresh strength and energy  now, which the imminence itself of the danger seemed to inspire. She  was excited, it is true, as well as the rest, but it was, in her case,  the excitement of courage and resolution, and not of senseless terror  and despair. She ascended to the deck; she took the direct command of  the ship; she gave instructions to the pilot how to steer; and, though  there was a storm coming on, she ordered every sail to be set, that  the ship might be driven as rapidly as possible through the water. She  forbade the captain to fire back upon their pursuers, fearing that  such firing would occasion delay; and she gave distinct and positive  orders to the captain, that so soon as it should appear that all hope  of escape was gone, and that they must inevitably fall into the hands  of their enemies, he was to set fire to the magazine of gunpowder, in  order that they might all be destroyed by the explosion.    In the mean time all the ships, pursuers and pursued, were rapidly  nearing the French coast. The fugitives were hoping to reach their  port. They were also hoping every moment to see some friendly French  ships appear in sight to rescue them. To balance this double hope,  there was a double fear. There were their pursuers behind them, whose  shots were continually booming over the water, threatening them with  destruction, and there was a storm arising which, with the great press  of sail that they were carrying, brought with it a danger, perhaps,  more imminent still.    It happened that these hopes and fears were all realized, and nearly  at the same time. A shot struck the ship, producing a great shock, and  throwing all on board into terrible consternation. It damaged the  rigging, bringing down the rent sails and broken cordage to the deck,  and thus stopped the vessel's way. At the same moment some French  vessels came in sight, and, as soon as they understood the case, bore  down full sail to rescue the disabled vessel. The pursuers, changing  suddenly their pursuit to flight, altered their course and moved slowly  away. The storm, however, increased, and, preventing them from making  the harbor of Dieppe, drove them along the shore, threatening every  moment to dash them upon the rocks and breakers. At length the queen's  vessel succeeded in getting into a rocky cove, where they were sheltered  from the winds and waves, and found a chance to land. The queen ordered  out the boat, and was set ashore with her attendants on the rocks. She  climbed over them, wet as they were with the dashing spray, and slippery  with sea weed. The little party, drenched with the rain, and exhausted  and forlorn, wandered along the shore till they came to a little village  of fishermen's huts. The queen went into the first wretched cabin which  offered itself, and lay down upon the straw in the corner for rest and  sleep.    The tidings immediately spread all over the region that the Queen of  England had landed on the coast, and produced, of course, universal  excitement. The gentry in the neighborhood flocked down the next  morning, in their carriages, to offer Henrietta their aid. They supplied  her wants, invited her to their houses, and offered her their equipages  to take her wherever she should decide to go. What she wanted was  seclusion and rest. They accordingly conveyed her, at her request, to  the Baths of Bourbon, where she remained some time, until, in fact,  her health and strength were in some measure restored. Great personages  of state were sent to her here from Paris, with money and all other  necessary supplies, and in due time she was escorted in state to the  city, and established in great magnificence and splendor in the Louvre,  which was then one of the principal palaces of the capital.    Notwithstanding the outward change which was thus made in the  circumstances of the exiled queen, she was very unhappy. As the  excitement of her danger and her efforts to escape it passed away, her  spirits sunk, her beauty faded, and her countenance assumed the wan  and haggard expression of despair. She mourned over the ruin of her  husband's hopes, and her separation from him and from her children,  with perpetual tears. She called to mind continually the image of the  little babe, not yet three weeks old, whom she had left so defenseless  in the very midst of her enemies. She longed to get some tidings of  the child, and reproached herself sometimes for having thus, as it  were, abandoned her.    The localities which were the scenes of these events have been made  very famous by them, and traditional tales of Queen Henrietta's  residence in Exeter, and of her romantic escape from it, have been  handed down there, from generation to generation, to the present day.  They caused her portrait to be painted too, and hung it up in the city  hall of Exeter as a memorial of their royal visitor. The palace where  the little infant was born has long since passed away, but the portrait  hangs in the Guildhall still.          CHAPTER IV.    ESCAPE OF THE CHILDREN.        We left the mother of Prince Charles, at the close of the last chapter,  in the palace of the Louvre in Paris. Though all her wants were now  supplied, and though she lived in royal state in a magnificent palace  on the banks of the Seine, still she was disconsolate and unhappy. She  had, indeed, succeeded in effecting her own escape from the terrible  dangers which had threatened her family in England, but she had left  her husband and children behind, and she could not really enjoy herself  the shelter which she had found from the storm, as long as those whom  she so ardently loved were still out, exposed to all its fury. She had  six children. Prince Charles, the oldest, was in the western part of  England, in camp, acting nominally as the commander of an army, and  fighting for his father's throne. He was now fourteen years of age.  Next to him was Mary, the wife of the Prince of Orange, who was safe  in Holland. She was one year younger than Charles.

I am filled with sorrow to think I  never saw any of the occupants of that smoking-room again: nearly all  young men full of hope for their prospects in a new world; mostly  unmarried; keen, alert, with the makings of good citizens. Presently,  hearing people walking about the corridors, I looked out and saw  several standing in the hall talking to a steward--most of them ladies  in dressing-gowns; other people were going upstairs, and I decided to  go on deck again, but as it was too cold to do so in a dressing-gown,  I dressed in a Norfolk jacket and trousers and walked up. There were  now more people looking over the side and walking about, questioning  each other as to why we had stopped, but without obtaining any  definite information. I stayed on deck some minutes, walking about  vigorously to keep warm and occasionally looking downwards to the sea  as if something there would indicate the reason for delay. The ship  had now resumed her course, moving very slowly through the water with  a little white line of foam on each side. I think we were all glad to  see this: it seemed better than standing still. I soon decided to go  down again, and as I crossed from the starboard to the port side to go  down by the vestibule door, I saw an officer climb on the last  lifeboat on the port side--number 16--and begin to throw off the  cover, but I do not remember that any one paid any particular  attention to him. Certainly no one thought they were preparing to man  the lifeboats and embark from the ship. All this time there was no  apprehension of any danger in the minds of passengers, and no one was  in any condition of panic or hysteria; after all, it would have been  strange if they had been, without any definite evidence of danger.    As I passed to the door to go down, I looked forward again and saw to  my surprise an undoubted tilt downwards from the stern to the bows:  only a slight slope, which I don't think any one had noticed,--at any  rate, they had not remarked on it. As I went downstairs a confirmation  of this tilting forward came in something unusual about the stairs, a  curious sense of something out of balance and of not being able to put  one's feet down in the right place: naturally, being tilted forward,  the stairs would slope downwards at an angle and tend to throw one  forward. I could not see any visible slope of the stairway: it was  perceptible only by the sense of balance at this time.    On D deck were three ladies--I think they were all saved, and it is a  good thing at least to be able to chronicle meeting some one who was  saved after so much record of those who were not--standing in the  passage near the cabin. \"Oh! why have we stopped?\" they said. \"We did  stop,\" I replied, \"but we are now going on again.\". \"Oh, no,\" one  replied; \"I cannot feel the engines as I usually do, or hear them.  Listen!\" We listened, and there was no throb audible. Having noticed  that the vibration of the engines is most noticeable lying in a bath,  where the throb comes straight from the floor through its metal  sides--too much so ordinarily for one to put one's head back with  comfort on the bath,--I took them along the corridor to a bathroom and  made them put their hands on the side of the bath: they were much  reassured to feel the engines throbbing down below and to know we were  making some headway. I left them and on the way to my cabin passed  some stewards standing unconcernedly against the walls of the saloon:  one of them, the library steward again, was leaning over a table,  writing. It is no exaggeration to say that they had neither any  knowledge of the accident nor any feeling of alarm that we had stopped  and had not yet gone on again full speed: their whole attitude  expressed perfect confidence in the ship and officers.    Turning into my gangway (my cabin being the first in the gangway), I  saw a man standing at the other end of it fastening his tie. \"Anything  fresh?\" he said. \"Not much,\" I replied; \"we are going ahead slowly and  she is down a little at the bows, but I don't think it is anything  serious.\" \"Come in and look at this man,\" he laughed; \"he won't get  up.\" I looked in, and in the top bunk lay a man with his back to me,  closely wrapped in his bed-clothes and only the back of his head  visible. \"Why won't he get up? Is he asleep?\" I said. \"No,\" laughed  the man dressing, \"he says--\" But before he could finish the sentence  the man above grunted: \"You don't catch me leaving a warm bed to go up  on that cold deck at midnight. I know better than that.\" We both told  him laughingly why he had better get up, but he was certain he was  just as safe there and all this dressing was quite unnecessary; so I  left them and went again to my cabin. I put on some underclothing, sat  on the sofa, and read for some ten minutes, when I heard through the  open door, above, the noise of people passing up and down, and a loud  shout from above: \"All passengers on deck with lifebelts on.\"    I placed the two books I was reading in the side pockets of my Norfolk  jacket, picked up my lifebelt (curiously enough, I had taken it down  for the first time that night from the wardrobe when I first retired  to my cabin) and my dressing-gown, and walked upstairs tying on the  lifebelt. As I came out of my cabin, I remember seeing the purser's  assistant, with his foot on the stairs about to climb them, whisper to  a steward and jerk his head significantly behind him; not that I  thought anything of it at the time, but I have no doubt he was telling  him what had happened up in the bows, and was giving him orders to  call all passengers.    Going upstairs with other passengers,--no one ran a step or seemed  alarmed,--we met two ladies coming down: one seized me by the arm and  said, \"Oh! I have no lifebelt; will you come down to my cabin and help  me to find it?\" I returned with them to F deck,--the lady who had  addressed me holding my arm all the time in a vise-like grip, much to  my amusement,--and we found a steward in her gangway who took them in  and found their lifebelts. Coming upstairs again, I passed the  purser's window on F deck, and noticed a light inside; when halfway up  to E deck, I heard the heavy metallic clang of the safe door, followed  by a hasty step retreating along the corridor towards the first-class  quarters. I have little doubt it was the purser, who had taken all  valuables from his safe and was transferring them to the charge of the  first-class purser, in the hope they might all be saved in one  package. That is why I said above that perhaps the envelope containing  my money was not in the safe at the bottom of the sea: it is probably  in a bundle, with many others like it, waterlogged at the bottom.    Reaching the top deck, we found many people assembled there,--some  fully dressed, with coats and wraps, well-prepared for anything that  might happen; others who had thrown wraps hastily round them when they  were called or heard the summons to equip themselves with  lifebelts--not in much condition to face the cold of that night.  Fortunately there was no wind to beat the cold air through our  clothing: even the breeze caused by the ship's motion had died  entirely away, for the engines had stopped again and the Titanic lay  peacefully on the surface of the sea--motionless, quiet, not even  rocking to the roll of the sea; indeed, as we were to discover  presently, the sea was as calm as an inland lake save for the gentle  swell which could impart no motion to a ship the size of the Titanic.  To stand on the deck many feet above the water lapping idly against  her sides, and looking much farther off than it really was because of  the darkness, gave one a sense of wonderful security: to feel her so  steady and still was like standing on a large rock in the middle of  the ocean. But there were now more evidences of the coming catastrophe  to the observer than had been apparent when on deck last: one was the  roar and hiss of escaping steam from the boilers, issuing out of a  large steam pipe reaching high up one of the funnels: a harsh,  deafening boom that made conversation difficult and no doubt increased  the apprehension of some people merely because of the volume of noise:  if one imagines twenty locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it  would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed  out on the top deck.    But after all it was the kind of phenomenon we ought to expect:  engines blow off steam when standing in a station, and why should not  a ship's boilers do the same when the ship is not moving? I never  heard any one connect this noise with the danger of boiler explosion,  in the event of the ship sinking with her boilers under a high  pressure of steam, which was no doubt the true explanation of this  precaution. But this is perhaps speculation; some people may have  known it quite well, for from the time we came on deck until boat 13  got away, I heard very little conversation of any kind among the  passengers. It is not the slightest exaggeration to say that no signs  of alarm were exhibited by any one: there was no indication of panic  or hysteria; no cries of fear, and no running to and fro to discover  what was the matter, why we had been summoned on deck with lifebelts,  and what was to be done with us now we were there. We stood there  quietly looking on at the work of the crew as they manned the  lifeboats, and no one ventured to interfere with them or offered to  help them. It was plain we should be of no use; and the crowd of men  "]]]
