They continued the argument outside the tent at  five-thirty the next morning, after the _reveille_ had sounded,  amidst shouts of approval from various shivering mortals who were  tubbing preparatory to embarking on the labours of the day.    A brisk first round had just come to a conclusion when Walton lounged  out of the tent, yawning.    Walton proceeded to separate the combatants. After which he rebuked  Billy Silver with a swagger-stick. Wren's share in the business he  overlooked. He was by way of being a patron of Wren's, and he disliked  Billy Silver, partly for his own sake and partly because he hated his  brother, with whom he had come into contact once or twice during his  career at Eckleton, always with unsatisfactory results.    So Walton dropped on to Billy Silver, and Wren continued his toilet  rejoicing.    Camp was beginning the strenuous life now. Tent after tent emptied  itself of its occupants, who stretched themselves vigorously, and  proceeded towards the tubbing-ground, where there were tin baths for  those who cared to wait until the same were vacant, and a good, honest  pump for those who did not. Then there was that unpopular job, the  piling of one's bedding outside the tent, and the rolling up of the  tent curtains. But these unpleasant duties came to an end at last, and  signs of breakfast began to appear.    Breakfast gave Kennedy his first insight into life in camp. He  happened to be tent-orderly that day, and it therefore fell to his lot  to join the orderlies from the other tents in their search for the  Eckleton rations. He returned with a cargo of bread (obtained from the  quartermaster), and, later, with a great tin of meat, which the  cook-house had supplied, and felt that this was life. Hitherto  breakfast had been to him a thing of white cloths, tables, and food  that appeared from nowhere. This was the first time he had ever  tracked his food to its source, so to speak, and brought it back with  him. After breakfast, when he was informed that, as tent-orderly for  the day, it was his business to wash up, he began to feel as if he  were on a desert island. He had never quite realised before what  washing-up implied, and he was conscious of a feeling of respect for  the servants at Blackburn's, who did it every day as a matter of  course, without complaint. He had had no idea before this of the  intense stickiness of a jammy plate.    One day at camp is much like another. The schools opened the day with  parade drill at about eight o'clock, and, after an instruction series  of \"changing direction half-left in column of double companies\", and  other pleasant movements of a similar nature, adjourned for lunch.  Lunch was much like breakfast, except that the supply of jam was cut  off. The people who arrange these things--probably the War Office, or  Mr Brodrick, or someone--have come to the conclusion that two pots of  jam per tent are sufficient for breakfast and lunch. The unwary devour  theirs recklessly at the earlier meal, and have to go jamless until  tea at six o'clock, when another pot is served out.    The afternoon at camp is perfect or otherwise, according to whether  there is a four o'clock field-day or not. If there is, there are more  manoeuvrings until tea-time, and the time is spent profitably, but not  so pleasantly as it might be. If there is no field-day, you can take  your time about your bathe in Cove Reservoir. And a really  satisfactory bathe on a hot day should last at least three hours.  Kennedy and Jimmy Silver strolled off in the direction of the  Reservoir as soon as they felt that they had got over the effects of  the beef, potatoes, and ginger-beer which a generous commissariat had  doled out to them for lunch. It was a glorious day, and bathing was  the only thing to do for the next hour or so. Stump-cricket, that  fascinating sport much indulged in in camp, would not be at its best  until the sun had cooled off a little.    After a pleasant half hour in the mud and water of the Reservoir, they  lay on the bank and watched the rest of the schools take their  afternoon dip. Kennedy had laid in a supply of provisions from the  stall which stood at the camp end of the water. Neither of them felt  inclined to move.    \"This _is_ decent,\" said Kennedy, wriggling into a more  comfortable position in the long grass. \"Hullo!\"    \"What's up?\" inquired Jimmy Silver, lazily.    He was almost asleep.    \"Look at those idiots. They're certain to get spotted.\"    Jimmy Silver tilted his hat off his face, and sat up.    \"What's the matter? Which idiot?\"    Kennedy pointed to a bush on their right. Walton and Perry were seated  beside it. Both were smoking.    \"Oh, that's all right,\" said Silver. \"Masters never come to Cove  Reservoir. It's a sort of unwritten law. They're rotters to smoke, all  the same. Certain to get spotted some day.... Not worth it.... Spoils  lungs.... Beastly bad ... training.\"    He dozed off. The sun was warm, and the grass very soft and  comfortable. Kennedy turned his gaze to the Reservoir again. It was no  business of his what Walton and Perry did.    Walton and Perry were discussing ways and means. The conversation  changed as they saw Kennedy glance at them. They were the sort of  persons who feel a vague sense of injury when anybody looks at them,  perhaps because they feel that those whose attention is attracted to  them must say something to their discredit when they begin to talk  about them.    \"There's that beast Kennedy,\" said Walton. \"I can't stick that man.  He's always hanging round the house. What he comes for, I can't make  out.\"    \"Pal of Fenn's,\" suggested Perry.    \"He hangs on to Fenn. I bet Fenn bars him really.\"    Perry doubted this in his innermost thoughts, but it was not worth  while to say so.    \"Those Blackburn chaps,\" continued Walton, reverting to another  grievance, \"will stick on no end of side next term about that cup.  They wouldn't have had a look in if Kay hadn't given Fenn that extra.  Kay ought to be kicked. I'm hanged if I'm going to care what I do next  term. Somebody ought to do something to take it out of Kay for getting  his own house licked like that.\"    Walton spoke as if the line of conduct he had mapped out for himself  would be a complete reversal of his customary mode of life. As a  matter of fact, he had never been in the habit of caring very much  what he did.    Walton's last remarks brought the conversation back to where it had  been before the mention of Kennedy switched it off on to new lines.  Perry had been complaining that he thought camp a fraud, that it was  all drilling and getting up at unearthly hours. He reminded Walton  that he had only come on the strength of the latter's statement that  it would be a rag. Where did the rag come in? That was what Perry  wanted to know.    \"When it's not a ghastly sweat,\" he concluded, \"it's slow. Like it is  now. Can't we do something for a change?\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" said Walton, \"nearly all the best rags are  played out. A chap at a crammer's told me last holidays that when he  was at camp he and some other fellows loosed the ropes of the  guard-tent. He said it was grand sport.\"    Perry sat up.    \"That's the thing,\" he said, excitedly. \"Let's do that. Why not?\"    \"It's beastly risky,\" objected Walton.    \"What's that matter? They can't do anything, even if they spot us.\"    \"That's all you know. We should get beans.\"    \"Still, it's worth risking. It would be the biggest rag going. Did the  chap tell you how they did it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Walton, becoming animated as he recalled the stirring  tale, \"they bagged the sentry. Chucked a cloth or something over his  head, you know. Then they shoved him into the ditch, and one of them  sat on him while the others loosed the ropes. It took the chaps inside  no end of a time getting out.\"    \"That's the thing. We'll do it. We only need one other chap. Leveson  would come if we asked him. Let's get back to the lines. It's almost  tea-time. Tell him after tea.\"    Leveson proved agreeable. Indeed, he jumped at it. His life, his  attitude suggested, had been a hollow mockery until he heard the plan,  but now he could begin to enjoy himself once more.    The lights-out bugle sounded at ten o'clock; the last post at  ten-thirty. At a quarter to twelve the three adventurers, who had been  keeping themselves awake by the exercise of great pains, satisfied  themselves that the other occupants of the tent were asleep, and stole  out.    It was an excellent night for their purpose. There was no moon, and  the stars were hidden by clouds.    They crept silently towards the guard-tent. A dim figure loomed out of  the blackness. They noted with satisfaction, as it approached, that it  was small. Sentries at the public-school camp vary in physique. They  felt that it was lucky that the task of sentry-go had not fallen that  night to some muscular forward from one of the school fifteens, or  worse still, to a boxing expert who had figured in the Aldershot  competition at Easter. The present sentry would be an easy victim.    They waited for him to arrive.    A moment later Private Jones, of St Asterisk's--for it was he--turning  to resume his beat, found himself tackled from behind. Two moments  later he was reclining in the ditch. He would have challenged his  adversary, but, unfortunately, that individual happened to be seated  on his face.    He struggled, but to no purpose.    He was still struggling when a muffled roar of indignation from the  direction of the guard-tent broke the stillness of the summer night.  The roar swelled into a crescendo. What seemed like echoes came from  other quarters out of the darkness. The camp was waking.    The noise from the guard-tent waxed louder.    The unknown marauder rose from his seat on Private Jones, and  vanished.    Private Jones also rose.

Barry takes his passes  much better, and doesn't lose his head when he's pressed.\"    \"Just what I thought,\" said Trevor. \"Then you'd go on playing him for  the first?\"    \"Rather. He'll get better every game, you'll see, as he gets more used  to playing in the first three-quarter line. And he's as keen as  anything on getting into the team. Practises taking passes and that  sort of thing every day.\"    \"Well, he'll get his colours if we lick Ripton.\"    \"We ought to lick them. They've lost one of their forwards, Clifford, a  red-haired chap, who was good out of touch. I don't know if you  remember him.\"    \"I suppose I ought to go and see Allardyce about these colours, now.  Good-bye.\"    There was running and passing on the Monday for every one in the three  teams. Trevor and Clowes met Mr Seymour as they were returning. Mr  Seymour was the football master at Wrykyn.    \"I see you've given Barry his second, Trevor.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I think you're wise to play him for the first. He knows the game,  which is the great thing, and he will improve with practice,\" said Mr  Seymour, thus corroborating Milton's words of the previous Saturday.    \"I'm glad Seymour thinks Barry good,\" said Trevor, as they walked on.  \"I shall go on playing him now.\"    \"Found out who wrote that letter yet?\"    Trevor laughed.    \"Not yet,\" he said.    \"Probably Rand-Brown,\" suggested Clowes. \"He's the man who would gain  most by Barry's not playing. I hear he had a row with Mill just before  his study was ragged.\"    \"Everybody in Seymour's has had rows with Mill some time or other,\"  said Trevor.    Clowes stopped at the door of the junior day-room to find his fag.  Trevor went on upstairs. In the passage he met Ruthven.    Ruthven seemed excited.    \"I say. Trevor,\" he exclaimed, \"have you seen your study?\"    \"Why, what's the matter with it?\"    \"You'd better go and look.\"          VII    \"WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE LEAGUE\"      Trevor went and looked.    It was rather an interesting sight. An earthquake or a cyclone might  have made it a little more picturesque, but not much more. The general  effect was not unlike that of an American saloon, after a visit from  Mrs Carrie Nation (with hatchet). As in the case of Mill's study, the  only thing that did not seem to have suffered any great damage was the  table. Everything else looked rather off colour. The mantelpiece had  been swept as bare as a bone, and its contents littered the floor.  Trevor dived among the debris and retrieved the latest addition to his  art gallery, the photograph of this year's first fifteen. It was a  wreck. The glass was broken and the photograph itself slashed with a  knife till most of the faces were unrecognisable. He picked up another  treasure, last year's first eleven. Smashed glass again. Faces cut  about with knife as before. His collection of snapshots was torn into a  thousand fragments, though, as Mr Jerome said of the papier-mache  trout, there may only have been nine hundred. He did not count  them. His bookshelf was empty. The books had gone to swell the  contents of the floor. There was a Shakespeare with its cover off.  Pages twenty-two to thirty-one of _Vice Versa_ had parted from the  parent establishment, and were lying by themselves near the door. _The  Rogues' March_ lay just beyond them, and the look of the cover  suggested that somebody had either been biting it or jumping on it with  heavy boots.    There was other damage. Over the mantelpiece in happier days had hung a  dozen sea gulls' eggs, threaded on a string. The string was still  there, as good as new, but of the eggs nothing was to be seen, save a  fine parti-coloured powder--on the floor, like everything else in the  study. And a good deal of ink had been upset in one place and another.    Trevor had been staring at the ruins for some time, when he looked up  to see Clowes standing in the doorway.    \"Hullo,\" said Clowes, \"been tidying up?\"    Trevor made a few hasty comments on the situation. Clowes listened  approvingly.    \"Don't you think,\" he went on, eyeing the study with a critical air,  \"that you've got too many things on the floor, and too few anywhere  else? And I should move some of those books on to the shelf, if I were  you.\"    Trevor breathed very hard.    \"I should like to find the chap who did this,\" he said softly.    Clowes advanced into the room and proceeded to pick up various  misplaced articles of furniture in a helpful way.    \"I thought so,\" he said presently, \"come and look here.\"    Tied to a chair, exactly as it had been in the case of Mill, was a neat  white card, and on it were the words, _\"With the Compliments of the  League\"._    \"What are you going to do about this?\" asked Clowes. \"Come into my room  and talk it over.\"    \"I'll tidy this place up first,\" said Trevor. He felt that the work  would be a relief. \"I don't want people to see this. It mustn't get  about. I'm not going to have my study turned into a sort of side-show,  like Mill's. You go and change. I shan't be long.\"    \"I will never desert Mr Micawber,\" said Clowes. \"Friend, my place is by  your side. Shut the door and let's get to work.\"    Ten minutes later the room had resumed a more or less--though  principally less--normal appearance. The books and chairs were back in  their places. The ink was sopped up. The broken photographs were  stacked in a neat pile in one corner, with a rug over them. The  mantelpiece was still empty, but, as Clowes pointed out, it now merely  looked as if Trevor had been pawning some of his household gods. There  was no sign that a devastating secret society had raged through the  study.    Then they adjourned to Clowes' study, where Trevor sank into Clowes'  second-best chair--Clowes, by an adroit movement, having appropriated  the best one--with a sigh of enjoyment. Running and passing, followed  by the toil of furniture-shifting, had made him feel quite tired.    \"It doesn't look so bad now,\" he said, thinking of the room they had  left. \"By the way, what did you do with that card?\"    \"Here it is. Want it?\"    \"You can keep it. I don't want it.\"    \"Thanks. If this sort of things goes on, I shall get quite a nice  collection of these cards. Start an album some day.\"    \"You know,\" said Trevor, \"this is getting serious.\"    \"It always does get serious when anything bad happens to one's self. It  always strikes one as rather funny when things happen to other people.  When Mill's study was wrecked, I bet you regarded it as an amusing and  original 'turn'. What do you think of the present effort?\"    \"Who on earth can have done it?\"    \"The Pres--\"    \"Oh, dry up. Of course it was. But who the blazes is he?\"    \"Nay, children, you have me there,\" quoted Clowes. \"I'll tell you one  thing, though. You remember what I said about it's probably being  Rand-Brown. He can't have done this, that's certain, because he was  out in the fields the whole time. Though I don't see who else could  have anything to gain by Barry not getting his colours.\"    \"There's no reason to suspect him at all, as far as I can see. I don't  know much about him, bar the fact that he can't play footer for nuts,  but I've never heard anything against him. Have you?\"    \"I scarcely know him myself. He isn't liked in Seymour's, I believe.\"    \"Well, anyhow, this can't be his work.\"    \"That's what I said.\"    \"For all we know, the League may have got their knife into Barry for  some reason. You said they used to get their knife into fellows in that  way. Anyhow, I mean to find out who ragged my room.\"    \"It wouldn't be a bad idea,\" said Clowes.           *       *       *       *       *    O'Hara came round to Donaldson's before morning school next day to tell  Trevor that he had not yet succeeded in finding the lost bat. He found  Trevor and Clowes in the former's den, trying to put a few finishing  touches to the same.    \"Hullo, an' what's up with your study?\" he inquired. He was quick at  noticing things. Trevor looked annoyed. Clowes asked the visitor if he  did not think the study presented a neat and gentlemanly appearance.    \"Where are all your photographs, Trevor?\" persisted the descendant of  Irish kings.    \"It's no good trying to conceal anything from the bhoy,\" said Clowes.  \"Sit down, O'Hara--mind that chair; it's rather wobbly--and I will tell  ye the story.\"    \"Can you keep a thing dark?\" inquired Trevor.    O'Hara protested that tombs were not in it.    \"Well, then, do you remember what happened to Mill's study? That's  what's been going on here.\"    O'Hara nearly fell off his chair with surprise. That some  philanthropist should rag Mill's study was only to be expected. Mill  was one of the worst. A worm without a saving grace. But Trevor!  Captain of football! In the first eleven! The thing was unthinkable.    \"But who--?\" he began.    \"That's just what I want to know,\" said Trevor, shortly. He did not  enjoy discussing the affair.    \"How long have you been at Wrykyn, O'Hara?\" said Clowes.    O'Hara made a rapid calculation. His fingers twiddled in the air as he  worked out the problem.    \"Six years,\" he said at last, leaning back exhausted with brain work.    \"Then you must remember the League?\"    \"Remember the League? Rather.\"    \"Well, it's been revived.\"    O'Hara whistled.    \"This'll liven the old place up,\" he said. \"I've often thought of  reviving it meself. An' so has Moriarty. If it's anything like the Old  League, there's going to be a sort of Donnybrook before it's done with.  I wonder who's running it this time.\"    \"We should like to know that. If you find out, you might tell us.\"    \"I will.\"    \"And don't tell anybody else,\" said Trevor. \"This business has got to  be kept quiet. Keep it dark about my study having been ragged.\"    \"I won't tell a soul.\"    \"Not even Moriarty.\"    \"Oh, hang it, man,\" put in Clowes, \"you don't want to kill the"]]]
