Mr. Swift was a very learned man, and this arrangement was  satisfactory to him, as it allowed Tom more time at home, so he  could aid his father on the inventive work and also plan things for  himself. Tom showed a taste for mechanics, and his father wisely  decided that such training as his son needed could be given at home  to better advantage than in a school or college.    Lessons over, Tom hurried to his own particular shop, and began  taking apart the damaged motor-cycle.    \"First I'll straighten the handle-bars, and then I'll fix the motor  and transmission,\" he decided. \"The front wheel I can buy in town,  as this one would hardly pay for repairing.\" Tom was soon busy with  wrenches, hammers, pliers and screw-driver. He was in his element,  and was whistling over his task. The motor he found in good  condition, but it was not such an easy task as he had hoped to  change the transmission. He had finally to appeal to his father, in  order to get the right proportion between the back and front gears,  for the motor-cycle was operated by a sprocket chain, instead of a  belt drive, as is the case with some.    Mr. Swift showed Tom how to figure out the number of teeth needed on  each sprocket, in order to get an increase of speed, and as there  was a sprocket wheel from a disused piece of machinery available,  Tom took that. He soon had it in place, and then tried the motor. To  his delight the number of revolutions of the rear wheel were  increased about fifteen per cent.    \"I guess I'll make some speed,\" he announced to his father.    \"But it will take more gasolene to run the motor; don't forget that.  You know the great principle of mechanics--that you can't get out of  a machine any more than you put into it, nor quite as much, as a  matter of fact, for considerable is lost through friction.\"    \"Well, then, I'll enlarge the gasolene tank,\" declared Tom. \"I want  to go fast when I'm going.\"    He reassembled the machine, and after several hours of work had it  in shape to run, except that a front wheel was lacking.    \"I think I'll go to town and get one,\" he remarked. \"The rain isn't  quite so hard now.\"    In spite of his father's mild objections Tom went, using his  bicycle, the chain of which he had quickly repaired. He found just  the front wheel needed, and that night his motor-cycle was ready to  run. But it was too dark to try it then, especially as he had no  good lantern, the one on the cycle having been smashed, and his own  bicycle light not being powerful enough. So he had to postpone his  trial trip until the next day.    He was up early the following morning, and went out for a spin  before breakfast. He came back, with flushed cheeks and bright eyes,  just as Mr. Swift and Mrs. Baggert were sitting down to the table.    \"To Reedville and back,\" announced Tom proudly.    \"What, a round trip of thirty miles!\" exclaimed Mr. Swift.    \"That's what!\" declared his son. \"I went like a greased pig most of  the way. I had to slow up going through Mansburg, but the rest of at  time I let it out for all it was worth.\"    \"You must be careful,\" cautioned his father. \"You are not an expert  yet.\"    \"No, I realize that. Several times, when I wanted to slow up, I  began to back-pedal, forgetting that I wasn't on my bicycle. Then I  thought to shut off the power and put on the brake. But it's  glorious fun. I'm going out again as soon as I have something to  eat. That is, unless you want me to help you, dad.\"    \"No, not this morning. Learn to ride the motor-cycle. It may come in  handy.\"    Neither Tom nor his father realized what an important part the  machine was soon to play in their lives.    Tom went out for another spin after breakfast, and in a different  direction. He wanted to see what the machine would do on a hill, and  there was a long, steep one about five miles from home. The roads  were in fine shape after the rain, and he speeded up the incline at  a rapid rate.    \"It certainly does eat up the road,\" the lad murmured. \"I have  improved this machine considerably. Wish I could take out a patent  on it.\"    Reaching the crest of the slope, he started down the incline. He  turned off part of the power, and was gliding along joyously, when  from a cross-road he suddenly saw turn into the main highway a mule,  drawing a ramshackle wagon, loaded with fence posts. Beside the  animal walked an old colored man.    \"I hope he gets out of the way in time,\" thought Tom. \"He's moving  as slow as molasses, and I'm going a bit faster than I like. Guess  I'll shut off and put on the brakes.\"    The mule and wagon were now squarely across the road. Tom was coming  nearer and nearer. He turned the handle-grip, controlling the supply  of gasolene, and to his horror he found that it was stuck. He could  not stop the motor-cycle!    \"Look out! Look out!\" cried Tom to the negro. \"Get out of the way! I  can't stop! Let me pass you!\"    The darky looked up. He saw the approaching machine, and he seemed  to lose possession of his senses.    \"Whoa, Boomerang!\" cried the negro. \"Whoa! Suffin's gwine t'  happen!\"    \"That's what!\" muttered Tom desperately, as he saw that there was  not room for him to pass without going into the ditch, a proceeding  that would mean an upset. \"Pull out of the way!\" he yelled again.    But either the driver could not understand, or did not appreciate  the necessity. The mule stopped and reared up. The colored man  hurried to the head of the animal to quiet it.    \"Whoa, Boomerang! Jest yo' stand still!\" he said.    Tom, with a great effort, managed to twist the grip and finally shut  off the gasolene. But it was too late. He struck the darky with the  front wheel. Fortunately the youth had managed to somewhat reduce  his speed by a quick application of the brake, or the result might  have been serious. As it was, the colored man was gently lifted away  from the mule's head and tossed into the long grass in the ditch.  Tom, by a great effort, succeeded in maintaining his seat in the  saddle, and then, bringing the machine to a stop, he leaped off and  turned back.    The colored man was sitting up, looking dazed.    \"Whoa, Boomerang!\" he murmured. \"Suffin's happened!\"    But the mule, who had quieted down, only waggled his ears lazily,  and Tom, ready to laugh, now that he saw he had not committed  manslaughter, hurried to where the colored man was sitting.          CHAPTER VIII.    SUSPICIOUS ACTIONS      \"Are you hurt?\" asked Tom as he leaned his motor-cycle against the  fence and stood beside the negro.    \"Hurt?\" repeated the darky. \"I'se killed, dat's what I is! I ain't  got a whole bone in mah body! Good landy, but I suttinly am in a  awful state! Would yo' mind tellin' me if dat ar' mule am still  alive?\"    \"Of course he is,\" answered Tom. \"He isn't hurt a bit. But why can't  you turn around and look for yourself?\"    \"No, sah! No, indeedy, sah!\" replied the colored man. \"Yo' doan't  catch dis yeah nigger lookin' around!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Why not? 'Cause I'll tell yo' why not. I'm so stiff an' I'm so  nearly broke t' pieces, dat if I turn mah head around it suah will  twist offen mah body. No, sah! No, indeedy, sah, I ain't gwine t'  turn 'round. But am yo' suah dat mah mule Boomerang ain't hurted?\"    \"No, he's not hurt a bit, and I'm sure you are not. I didn't strike  you hard, for I had almost stopped my machine. Try to get up. I'm  positive you'll find yourself all right. I'm sorry it happened.\"    \"Oh, dat's all right. Doan't mind me,\" went on the colored man. \"It  was mah fault fer gittin in de road. But dat mule Boomerang am  suttinly de most outrageous quadruped dat ever circumlocuted.\"    \"Why do you call him Boomerang?\" asked Tom, wondering if the negro  really was hurt.    \"What fo' I call him Boomerang? Did yo' eber see dem Australian  black mans what go around wid a circus t'row dem crooked sticks dey  calls boomerangs?\"    \"Yes, I've seen them.\"    \"Well, Boomerang, mah mule, am jest laik dat. He's crooked, t' begin  wid, an' anudder t'ing, yo' can't never tell when yo' start him whar  he's gwine t' land up. Dat's why I calls him Boomerang.\"    \"I see. It's a very proper name. But why don't you try to get up?\"    \"Does yo' t'ink I can?\"    \"Sure. Try it. By the way, what's your name?\"    \"My name? Why I was christened Eradicate Andrew Jackson Abraham  Lincoln Sampson, but folks most ginnerally calls me Eradicate  Sampson, an' some doan't eben go to dat length. Dey jest calls me  Rad, fo' short.\"    \"Eradicate,\" mused Tom. \"That's a queer name, too. Why were you  called that?\"    \"Well, yo' see I eradicates de dirt. I'm a cleaner an' a whitewasher  by profession, an' somebody gib me dat name. Dey said it were fitten  an' proper, an' I kept it eber sence. Yais, sah, I'se Eradicate  Sampson, at yo' service. Yo' ain't got no chicken coops yo' wants  cleaned out, has yo'? Or any stables or fences t' whitewash? I  guarantees satisfaction.\"    \"Well, I might find some work for you to do,\" replied the young  inventor, thinking this would be as good a means as any of placating  the darky. \"But come, now, try and see if you can't stand. I don't  believe I broke any of your legs.\"    \"I guess not. I feels better now. Where am dat work yo' was speakin'  ob?\" and Eradicate Sampson, now that there seemed to be a prospect  of earning money, rose quickly and easily.    \"Why, you're all right!\" exclaimed Tom, glad to find that the  accident had had no serious consequences.    \"Yais, sah, I guess I be. Whar did yo' say, yo' had some  whitewashin' t' do?\"    \"No place in particular, but there is always something that needs  doing at our house. If you call I'll give you a job.\"    \"Yais, sah, I'll be sure to call,\" and Eradicate walked back to  where Boomerang was patiently waiting.    Tom told the colored man how to find the Swift home, and was  debating with himself whether he ought not to offer Eradicate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#7)"],[1,"their  causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.  Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness  akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest  sensations I can remember.    On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave  up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native  country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,  the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a  league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the  lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my  temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was  indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I united  myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry  Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular  talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for  its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He  composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and  knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into  masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of  Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous  train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands  of the infidels.    No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My  parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We  felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their  caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we  enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly discerned how  peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement  of filial love.    My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some  law in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits,  but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things  indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor  the code of governments, nor the politics of various states, possessed  attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I  desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or  the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied  me, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or, in its  highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.    Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral  relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and  the actions of men, were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to  become one among those whose names are recorded in story, as the  gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of  Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her  sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her  celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the  living spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen  in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was  there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And  Clerval--could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?--yet  he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his  generosity--so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for  adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of  beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring  ambition.    I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,  before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of  extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.  Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those  events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery: for  when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which  afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river,  from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it  proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away  all my hopes and joys.    Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,  therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my  predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we all  went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of  the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this  house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I  opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and  the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling into  enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with  joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked  carelessly at the titlepage of my book, and said, \"Ah! Cornelius  Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad  trash.\"    If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to  me, that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that  a modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much  greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were  chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical; under  such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and  have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with  greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible, that the train  of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my  ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no  means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I  continued to read with the greatest avidity.    When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of  this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read  and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they  appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself. I have described  myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate  the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful  discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies  discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed  that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and  unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of  natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy's  apprehensions, as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.    The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted  with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little  more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal  lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,  anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in  their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had  gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human  beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I  had repined.    But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and  knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became  their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the  eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the  schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to  my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to  struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for  knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors, I entered with the  greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the  elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.  Wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the  discovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render  man invulnerable to any but a violent death!    Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a  promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of  which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always  unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and  mistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus  for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an  unadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately  in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent  imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the  current of my ideas.    When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near  Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It  advanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at  once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I  remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity  and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of  fire issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards  from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had  disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited  it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.  It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribands  of wood. I never beheld any thing so utterly destroyed.    Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of  electricity. On this occasion a man of"]]]
