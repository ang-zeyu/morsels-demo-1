Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#7)"],[1,"for hostile Indians who had committed  some depredations in their neighborhood.  From them we learned that  the Rogue River Indians in southern Oregon were on the war-path, and  that as the \"regular troops up there were of no account, the citizens  had taken matters in hand, and intended cleaning up the hostiles.\"  They swaggered about our camp, bragged a good deal, cursed the  Indians loudly, and soundly abused the Government for not giving them  better protection.  It struck me, however, that they had not worked  very hard to find the hostiles; indeed, it could plainly be seen that  their expedition was a town-meeting sort of affair, and that anxiety  to get safe home was uppermost in their thoughts.  The enthusiasm  with which they started had all oozed out, and that night they  marched back to Jacksonville.  The next day, at the head of the lake,  we came across an Indian village, and I have often wondered since  what would have been the course pursued by these valiant warriors  from Jacksonville had they gone far enough to get into its vicinity.    When we reached the village the tepees--made of grass--were all  standing, the fires burning and pots boiling--the pots filled with  camas and tula roots--but not an Indian was to be seen.  Williamson  directed that nothing in the village should be disturbed; so guards  were placed over it to carry out his instructions and we went into  camp just a little beyond.  We had scarcely established ourselves  when a very old Indian rose up from the high grass some distance off,  and with peaceable signs approached our camp, evidently for the  purpose of learning whether or not our intentions were hostile.  Williamson told him we were friendly; that we had passed through his  village without molesting it, that we had put a guard there to secure  the property his people had abandoned in their fright, and that they  might come back in safety.  The old man searchingly eyed everything  around for some little time, and gaining confidence from the  peaceable appearance of the men, who were engaged in putting up the  tents and preparing their evening meal, he concluded to accept our  professions of friendship, and bring his people in.  Going out about  half a mile from the village he gave a peculiar yell, at which  between three and four hundred Indians arose simultaneously from the  ground, and in answer to his signal came out of the tall grass like a  swarm of locusts and soon overran our camp in search of food, for  like all Indians they were hungry.  They too, proved to be Pit  Rivers, and were not less repulsive than those of their tribe we had  met before.  They were aware of the hostilities going on between the  Rogue Rivers and the whites, but claimed that they had not taken any  part in them.  I question if they had, but had our party been small,  I fear we should have been received at their village in a very  different manner.    From the upper Klamath Lake we marched over the divide and down the  valley of the Des Chutes River to a point opposite the mountains  called the Three Sisters.  Here, on September 23, the party divided,  Williamson and I crossing through the crater of the Three Sisters and  along the western slope of the Cascade Range, until we struck the  trail on McKenzie River, which led us into the Willamette Valley not  far from Eugene City.  We then marched down the Willamette Valley to  Portland, Oregon, where we arrived October 9, 1855    The infantry portion of the command, escorting Lieutenant Henry L.  Abbot, followed farther down the Des Chutes River, to a point  opposite Mount Hood, from which it came into the Willamette Valley  and then marched to Portland.  At Portland we all united, and moving  across the point between the Willamette and Columbia rivers, encamped  opposite Fort Vancouver, on the south bank of the latter stream, on  the farm of an old settler named Switzler, who had located there many  years before.          CHAPTER IV.    \"OLD RED\"--SKILLFUL SHOOTING--YAKIMA--WAR--A LUDICROUS  MISTAKE--\"CUT-MOUTH JOHN'S\" ENCOUNTER--FATHER PANDOZA'S  MISSION--A SNOW-STORM--FAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION.    Our camp on the Columbia, near Fort Vancouver, was beautifully  situated on a grassy sward close to the great river; and--as little  duty was required of us after so long a journey, amusement of one  kind or another, and an interchange of visits with the officers at  the post, filled in the time acceptably.  We had in camp an old  mountaineer guide who had accompanied us on the recent march, and who  had received the sobriquet of \"Old Red,\" on account of the shocky and  tangled mass of red hair and beard, which covered his head and face  so completely that only his eyes could be seen.  His eccentricities  constantly supplied us with a variety of amusements.  Among the  pastimes he indulged in was one which exhibited his skill with the  rifle, and at the same time protected the camp from the intrusions  and ravages of a drove of razor-backed hogs which belonged to Mr.  Switzler.  These hogs were frequent visitors, and very destructive to  our grassy sward, rooting it up in front of our tents and all about  us; in pursuit of bulbous roots and offal from the camp.  Old Red  conceived the idea that it would be well to disable the pigs by  shooting off the tips of their snouts, and he proceeded to put his  conception into execution, and continued it daily whenever the hogs  made their appearance.  Of course their owner made a row about it;  but when Old Red daily settled for his fun by paying liberally with  gold-dust from some small bottles of the precious metal in his  possession, Switzler readily became contented, and I think even  encouraged the exhibitions--of skill.    It was at this period (October, 1855) that the Yakima Indian war  broke out, and I was detached from duty with the exploring party and  required by Major Gabriel J. Rains, then commanding the district, to  join an expedition against the Yakimas.  They had some time before  killed their agent, and in consequence a force under Major Granville  O. Haller had been sent out from the Dalles of the Columbia to  chastise them; but the expedition had not been successful; in fact,  it had been driven back, losing a number of men and two mountain  howitzers.    The object of the second expedition was to retrieve this disaster.  The force was composed of a small body of regular troops, and a  regiment of Oregon mounted volunteers under command of Colonel James  W. Nesmith--subsequently for several years United States Senator from  Oregon.  The whole force was under the command of Major Rains, Fourth  Infantry, who, in order that he might rank Nesmith, by some  hocus-pocus had been made a brigadier-general, under an appointment  from the Governor of Washington Territory.    We started from the Dalles October 30, under conditions that were not  conducive to success.  The season was late for operations; and worse  still, the command was not in accord with the commanding officer,  because of general belief in his incompetency, and on account of the  fictitious rank he assumed.  On the second day out I struck a small  body of Indians with my detachment of dragoons, but was unable to do  them any particular injury beyond getting possession of a large  quantity of their winter food, which their hurried departure  compelled them to abandon.  This food consisted principally of dried  salmon-pulverized and packed in sacks made of grass-dried  huckleberries, and dried camas; the latter a bulbous root about the  size of a small onion, which, when roasted and ground, is made into  bread by the Indians and has a taste somewhat like cooked chestnuts.    Our objective point was Father Pandoza's Mission, in the Yakima  Valley, which could be reached by two different routes, and though  celerity of movement was essential, our commanding officer  \"strategically\" adopted the longer route, and thus the Indians had  ample opportunity to get away with their horses, cattle, women and  children, and camp property.    After the encounter which I just now referred to, the command, which  had halted to learn the results of my chase, resumed its march to and  through the Klikitat canon, and into the lower Yakima Valley, in the  direction of the Yakima River.  I had charge at the head of the  column as it passed through the canon, and on entering the valley  beyond, saw in the distance five or six Indian scouts, whom I pressed  very closely, until after a run of several miles they escaped across  the Yakima River.    The soil in the valley was light and dry, and the movement of animals  over it raised great clouds of dust, that rendered it very difficult  to distinguish friend from foe; and as I was now separated from the  main column a considerable distance, I deemed it prudent to call a  halt until we could discover the direction taken by the principal  body of the Indians.  We soon learned that they had gone up the  valley, and looking that way, we discovered a column of alkali dust  approaching us, about a mile distant, interposing between my little  detachment and the point where I knew General Rains intended to  encamp for the night.  After hastily consulting with Lieutenant  Edward H. Day, of the Third United States Artillery, who was with me,  we both concluded that the dust was caused by a body of the enemy  which had slipped in between us and our main force.  There seemed no  alternative left us but to get back to our friends by charging  through these Indians; and as their cloud of dust was much larger  than ours, this appeared a desperate chance.  Preparations to charge  were begun, however, but, much to our surprise, before they were  completed the approaching party halted for a moment and then  commenced to retreat.  This calmed the throbbing of our hearts, and  with a wild cheer we started in a hot pursuit, that continued for  about two miles, when to our great relief we discovered that we were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#7)"],[1,"erstood, especially when one thinks and  lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among  those only who think and live otherwise--namely, kurmagati [Footnote:  Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best \"froglike,\" mandeikagati  [Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be \"difficultly  understood\" myself!)--and one should be heartily grateful for the  good will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards \"the good  friends,\" however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as  friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to  grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one can  thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends--and  laugh then also!    28. What is most difficult to render from one language into another  is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the  race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the  assimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations,  which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the  original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and  obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be  rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;  consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most  delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just  as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience,  so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything  ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying  species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germans--pardon  me for stating the fact that even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of  stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the \"good  old time\" to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a  time when there was still a \"German taste,\" which was a rococo-taste  in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic  nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was  not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in  the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the  Roman comedy-writers--Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO,  and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even  in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his  \"Principe\" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot  help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo,  perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he  ventures to present--long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and  a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who  would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any  great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and  words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world,  or of the \"ancient world,\" when like him, one has the feet of a wind,  the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes  everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to  Aristophanes--that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose  sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has  understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and  transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on  PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit  fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no  \"Bible,\" nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic--but a book of  Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life--a Greek life which  he repudiated--without an Aristophanes!    29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a  privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best  right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably  not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a  labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself  already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see  how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal  by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it  is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor  sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go  back again to the sympathy of men!    30. Our deepest insights must--and should--appear as follies, and under  certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to  the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The  exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by  philosophers--among the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and  Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and  NOT in equality and equal rights--are not so much in contradistinction  to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and  viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not  from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in  question views things from below upwards--while the esoteric class views  things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which  tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the  woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether  the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and  thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the higher class of  men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely  different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common  man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be  possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go  to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he  would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he  had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and  the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the  higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are  dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are  herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the  general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people  clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they  reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if  one wishes to breathe PURE air.    31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art  of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do  hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay.  Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR  THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns  to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try  conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The  angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no  peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able  to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something  falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by  continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself--still  ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how  it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges  itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary  blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's  sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the  good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and  lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses  upon principle the cause AGAINST \"youth.\"--A decade later, and one  comprehends that all this was also still--youth!    32. Throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it the  prehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferred  from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into  consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at  present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to  its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what  induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period  the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, \"Know thyself!\" was  then still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand,  on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far,  that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,  decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an  important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect  of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in \"origin,\"  the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as  the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby  made. Instead of the consequences, the origin--what an inversion  of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long  struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a  peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely  thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite  sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the  belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.  The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an"]]]
