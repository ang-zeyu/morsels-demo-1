See \"Popular Physics,\" pp. 81-83, for a  full description of this subject, and for many illustrations.]--In  producing the motions of the body, the muscles use the bones as levers. We  see an illustration of the _first class_ of levers in the movements  of the head. The back or front of the head is the weight to be lifted, the  backbone is the fulcrum on which the lever turns, and the muscles at the  back or front of the neck exert the power by which we toss or bow the  head.    FIG. 19.    [Illustration: _The hand as a Lever of the third class._]    When we raise the body on tiptoe, we have an instance of the _second  class_. Here, our toes resting on the ground form the fulcrum the  muscles of the calf (gas-troc-ne'-mi-us, _j_ and so-le'-us, Fig. 14),  acting through the tendon of the heel, [Footnote: This is called the  Tendon of Achilles (_k_, Fig. 14) and is so named because, as the  fable runs, when Achilles was an infant his mother held him by the heel  while she dipped him in the River Styx, whose water had the power of  rendering one invulnerable to any weapon. His heel, not being wet, was his  weak point, to which Paris directed the fatal arrow--\"This tendon,\" says  Mapother, \"will bear one thousand pounds weight before it will break.\" The  horse is said to be \"hamstrung,\" and is rendered useless, when the Tendon  of Achilles is cut. (see p. 284.)] are the power and the weight is borne  by the ankle joint.    An illustration of the _third class_ is found in lifting the hand  from the elbow. The hand is the weight, the elbow the fulcrum, and the  power is applied by the biceps muscle at its attachment to the radius (A,  Fig. 19.) In this form of the lever there is great loss of force, because  it is applied at such a distance from the weight, but there is a gain of  velocity, since the hand moves so far by such a slight contraction of the  muscle. The hand is required to perform quick motions, and therefore this  mode of attachment is desirable.    The nearer the power is applied to the resistance, the more easily the  work is done. In the lower jaw, for example, the jaw is the weight, the  fulcrum is the hinge joint at the back, and the muscles (temporal,  _d_, and the mas'-se'ter, _e_, Fig. 14) on each side are the  power. [Footnote: We may feel the contraction of the masseter by placing  our hand on the face when we work the jaw, while the temporal can be  readily detected by putting the fingers on the temple while we are  chewing. The tendon of the muscle (digastric)--one of those which open the  jaw--passes through a pulley (_c_, Fig. 14) somewhat like the one in  the eye.] They act much closer to the resistance than those in the hand,  since here we desire force, and there, speed.    FIG. 20.    [Illustration: _The Kneejoint;_ k, _the patella;_ f, _the  tendon._]    THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE BONES AT THE JOINTS not only affords greater  surface for the attachment of the muscles, as we have seen, but also  enables them to work to better advantage. Thus, in Fig. 20 it is evident  that a muscle acting in the line _f b_ would not bend the lower limb  so easily as if it were acting in the line _f k_, since in the former  case its force would be about all spent in drawing the bones more closely  together, while in the latter it would pull more nearly at a right angle.  Thus the tendon _f_, by passing over the patella, which is itself  pushed out by the protuberance _b_ of the thigh bone, pulls at a  larger angle, [Footnote: The chief use of the processes of the spine (Fig.  6) and other bones is, in the same way, to throw out the point on which  the power acts as far from the fulcrum as possible. The projections of the  ulna (\"funny bone\") behind the elbow, and that of the heel bone to which  the Tendon of Achilles is attached, are excellent illustrations (Fig. 1).]  and so the leg is thrown forward with ease in walking and with great force  in kicking.    HOW WE STAND ERECT.--The joints play so easily, and the center of gravity  in the body is so far above the foot, that the skeleton can not of itself  hold our bodies upright. Thus it requires the action of many muscles to  maintain this position. The head so rests upon the spine as to tend to  fall in front, but the muscles of the neck steady it in its place.  [Footnote: In animals the jaws are so heavy, and the place where the head  and spine join is so far back, that there can be no balance as there is in  man. There are therefore large muscles in their necks. We readily find  that we have none if we get on \"all fours\" and try to hold up the head. On  the other hand, gorillas and apes can not stand erect like man, for the  reason that their head, trunk, legs, etc., are not balanced by muscles, so  as to be in line with one another.] The hips incline forward, but are held  erect by the strong muscles of the back. The trunk is nicely balanced on  the head of the thigh bones. The great muscles of the thigh acting over  the kneepan tend to bend the body forward, but the muscles of the calf  neutralize this action. The ankle, the knee, and the hip lie in nearly the  same line, and thus the weight of the body rests directly on the keystone  of the arch of the foot. So perfectly do these muscles act that we never  think of them until science calls our attention to the subject, and yet to  acquire the necessary skill to use them in our infancy needed patient  lessons, much time, and many hard knocks.    FIG. 21.    [Illustration: _Action of the Muscles which keep the body erect._]    HOW WE WALK.--Walking is as complex an act as standing. It is really a  perilous performance, which has become safe only because of constant  practice. We see how violent it is when we run against a post in the dark,  and find with what headlong force we were hurling ourselves forward.  Holmes has well defined walking as a perpetual falling with a constant  self-recovery. Standing on one foot, we let the body fall forward, while  we swing the other leg ahead like a pendulum. Planting that foot on the  ground, to save the body from falling farther, we then swing the first  foot forward again to repeat the same operation. [Footnote: It is a  curious fact that one side of the body tends to outwalk the other; and so,  when a man is lost in the woods, he often goes in a circle, and at last  comes round to the spot whence he started.]    The shorter the pendulum, the more rapidly it vibrates; and so short-  legged people take quicker and shorter steps than long-legged ones.  [Footnote: In this respect, Tom Thumb was to Magrath, whose skeleton,  eight and one half feet high, is now in the Dublin Museum, what a little  fast-ticking, French mantel clock is to a big, old-fashioned, upright,  corner timepiece.] We are shorter when walking than when standing still,  because of this falling forward to take a step in advance. [Footnote:  Women find that a gown that will swing clear of the ground when they are  standing still, will drag the street when they are walking. The length of  the step may be increased by muscular effort, as when a line of soldiers  keep step in spite of their having legs of different lengths. Such a mode  of walking is necessarily fatiguing. (See p. 280.)]    In running, we incline the body more, and so, as it were, fall faster.  When we walk, one foot is on the ground all the time, and there is an  instant when both feet are planted upon it; but in running there is an  interval of time in each step when both feet are off the ground, and the  body is wholly unsupported. As we step alternately with the feet, we are  inclined to turn the body first to one side and then to the other. This  movement is sometimes counterbalanced by swinging the hand on the opposite  side. [Footnote: In ordinary walking the speed is nearly four miles an  hour, and can be kept up for a long period. But exercise and a special  aptitude for it enable some men to walk great distances in a relatively  short space of time. Trained walkers have gone seventy-five miles in  twenty hours, and walked the distance of thirty-seven miles at the rate of  five miles an hour. The mountaineers of the Alps are generally good  walkers, and some of them are not less remarkable for endurance than for  speed. Jacques Balmat, who was the first to reach the summit of Mont  Blanc, at sixteen years of age could walk from the hamlet of the Pélerins  to the mountain of La Côte in two hours,--a distance which the best-  trained travelers required from five to six hours to get over. At the time  of his last attempt to reach the top of Mont Blanc, this same guide, then  twenty years old, passed six days and four nights without sleeping or  reposing a single moment. One of his sons, Édouard Balmat, left Paris to  join his regiment at Genoa; he reached Chamouni the fifth day at evening,  having walked three hundred and forty miles. After resting two days, he  set off again for Genoa, where he arrived in two days. Several years  afterward, this same man left the baths at Louèche at two o'clock in the  morning, and reached Chamouni at nine in the evening, having walked a  distance equal to about seventy-five miles in nineteen hours. In 1844, an  old guide of De Saussure, eighty years old, left the hamlet of Prats, in  the valley of Chamouni, in the afternoon, and reached the Grand-Mulets at  ten in the evening; then, after resting some hours, he climbed the glacier  to the vicinity of the Grand Plateau, which has an altitude of about  thirteen thousand feet, and then returned to his village without  stopping.--_Wonders of the Body_.]    THE MUSCULAR SENSE.--When we lift an object, we feel a sensation of  weight, which we can compare with that experienced in lifting another  body.

He  assigned to himself the towns of Betis and Lubao in the province of  Pampanga, besides others of some importance. The succeeding government  dispossessed him of these towns; but afterward his Majesty, on account  of his good services, granted them all to him, and he enjoyed them,  together with the office of master-of-camp of the islands, as long  as he lived.        ¶The administration of Doctor Francisco de Sande, and the events of  the Filipinas Islands during his term.    ¶CHAPTER SECOND    When the news of the entrance and conquest of the Filipinas Islands  by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, and of his death, reached Españia, his  Majesty appointed as governor and captain-general of the islands,  Doctor Francisco de Sande, a native of Caceres, and alcalde of the  Audiencia of Mexico. The latter journeyed thither, and took over his  government in the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-five.    During this administration, the pacification of the islands was  continued, especially that of the province of Camarines, by Captain  Pedro Chaves, who often came to blows with the natives, until he  conquered them and received their submission. A Spanish colony  was founded there which was called the city of Caceres. Among other  enterprises, the governor made in person the expedition to the island  of Borneo with a fleet of galleys and frigates. [27] With these he  attacked and captured the enemy's fleet, which had come out to meet  him. He captured also the principal settlement, where the king of the  island had his house and residence, but after a few days he abandoned  it and returned to Manila, on account of sickness among the crews,  and his inability to support and care for the Spaniards in that  island. On the way back, and by his orders, Captain Estevan Rodriguez  de Figueroa entered the island of Jólo; he came to blows with the  natives and their chief, whom he conquered, and the latter rendered  him acknowledgment and submission in the name of his Majesty. Thence  he went to the island of Mindanao which he explored, reconnoitering  its river and chief settlements. On his way he reduced other towns and  natives of the same island, who had been pacified, to friendship and  alliance with the Spaniards. The governor despatched the ship \"San  Juanillo\" to Nueva España, under command of Captain Juan de Ribera,  but it was lost at sea and never heard of again.    Doctor Sande remained until Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa came from  Españia as the new governor and captain-general. After his residencia  the doctor returned to Nueva España to fill the office of auditor  of Mexico.        ¶ Of the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, and of  Diego Ronquillo, who filled the office because of the former's death.    ¶ CHAPTER THIRD    Because of the many accounts that had reached the court of his  Majesty concerning the affairs of the Filipinas, and because of their  need of being supplied with settlers and soldiers to pacify them,  an arrangement was made with Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, a  native of Arevalo, and chief alguacil of the Audiencia of Mexico,  who was residing at court, so that it might be done better and at  less cost to the royal exchequer. By this arrangement he was to be  governor of the Filipinas for life and was to take six hundred married  and single men from the kingdoms of Castilla to the Filipinas. His  Majesty granted him certain assistance and facilities for this purpose,  together with other favors as a reward for this service.    Don Gonzalo prepared for the voyage, raised his people, and embarked  them in the port of San Lucas Barremeda, but, as the fleet left the  bar, one of his ships was wrecked. He returned in order to repair his  losses, and, although he took less than at first, he made his journey  to the mainland, and at Panama, embarked his people in the South Sea,  and set sail for the Filipinas, where he arrived and took over the  government, in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty.    Don Gonzalo Ronquillo founded a Spanish town in the island of Panay,  in Oton, which he named Arevalo. During his term, the trade with  the Chinese increased, and he built a market-place and Parián for  them within the city, where the Chinese could bring and sell their  merchandise. He tried to discover a return passage from the islands  to Nueva España, by way of the south, for which purpose he sent his  cousin, Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo. The latter could not  effect this, for after sailing for some time, until finding himself  near Nueva Guinea, he could go no farther, on account of many severe  storms, and returned to the Filipinas. In like manner, Don Gonzalo sent  another ship, under command of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Vallesteros,  to Peru, with some merchandise, in order to obtain certain goods from  those provinces which he said that the Filipinas needed. This vessel  returned from Peru after the death of the governor. The latter imposed  the two per cent duty on the merchandise exported to Nueva España,  and the three per cent duty on the goods imported by the Chinese to  the Filipinas. Although he was censured for having done this without  his Majesty's orders, these duties remained in force, and continued  to be imposed thenceforward.    During this same term, as his Majesty had succeeded to the kingdoms  of Portugal, and had ordered the governor of Manila to maintain  good relations with the chief captain of the fortress of the island  of Tidore, in Maluco, and to assist him when necessary, he sent a  fleet and soldiers thither from Manila, under command of Captain Don  Juan Ronquillo del Castillo. This he did at the request of Diego de  Azambuja, chief captain of Tidore, for the expedition and conquest  of the island of Terrenate. But after reaching Maluco, the expedition  did not succeed in its object. [28] Thenceforward supplies of men and  provisions continued to be sent from the Filipinas to the fortress  of Tidore.    During this same administration, the province of Cagayan in the island  of Luzon, opposite China, was first pacified [29] by Captain Joan  Pablos de Carrion, who founded there a Spanish colony, which he named  Nueva Segovia. He also drove a Japanese pirate [30] from that place,  who had seized the port with some ships, and fortified himself there.    A few days after Don Gonzalo Ronquillo had entered into the  government, he sent Captain Gabriel de Ribera with a small fleet,  consisting of one galley and several frigates, to explore the coast  and settlements of the island of Borneo, with orders to proceed  thence to the kingdom of Patan on the mainland, where pepper is  produced. The captain having coasted along and reconnoitered Borneo,  returned with his fleet to Manila, on account of the advanced season  and lack of provisions. Thence the governor sent him to España,  with authority from himself and from the islands, to confer with  his Majesty upon several matters that he desired to see carried out,  and upon others which would prove advantageous to the islands. [31]  The captain found his Majesty in Portugal, gave him a few pieces of  gold and other curiosities which he had brought for that purpose,  and stated the matters of which he had come to treat. The result was  that his Majesty, among other favors, appointed him marshal of Bonbon,  for his hardships during this voyage, and the proper resolution was  made in the matters of which he had come to treat.    It was during the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, that the  first bishop of the Filipinas was appointed, in the person of Don Fray  Domingo de Salazar, of the Dominican order, a man of great learning and  piety. As soon as he arrived in the islands, he took upon himself the  management and jurisdiction of ecclesiastical affairs, which were at  first in charge of the Augustinian friars who had come at the time of  the conquest, and afterwards of the discalced Franciscan religious,  who had arrived at the time of the conversion. The bishop erected his  cathedral in the city of Manila, by apostolic bulls, with prebends paid  by the royal exchequer, until there should be tithes and ecclesiastical  revenues to maintain themselves. Moreover, he provided whatever else  was necessary for the service and decoration of the church, and for  the divine worship which is celebrated there with great solemnity  and display. Don Fray Domingo de Salazar took Antonio Sedeño and  Alonso Sanchez, both priests and grave members of the Society of  Jesus, with him. They were the first to establish that order in the  Filipinas, which, since that time, has been steadily growing, to the  great profit and fruit of the teaching and conversion of the natives,  consolation of the Spaniards, and the education and teaching of their  children in the studies which they pursue.    Don Gonzalo Ronquillo was in such poor health from the day on which  he entered upon his administration, that he died in the year one  thousand five hundred and eighty-three, and his body was buried in  the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila.    His kinsman, Diego Ronquillo, by virtue of his appointment through  a decree of his Majesty, succeeded him in the governorship; this man  continued what Don Gonzalo had commenced, especially in the assistance  for Maluco and pacification for other islands.    During the same term of Diego Ronquillo, a fire broke out in the city  of Manila, which started at midday in the church of the convent of  St. Augustine, while the doors of the church were closed. The fire  increased so rapidly that all the city was burned in a few hours,  as it was built of wood. There was great loss of goods and property,  and some persons were in danger. The city was rebuilt with great  difficulty and labor, leaving the Spaniards very poor and needy. [32]    The"]]]
