You can say it's  Prince Renine.\"    Holding the receiver in his hand, he turned to Gaston Dutreuil:    \"I can ask some one to come here, I suppose? We shall be quite  undisturbed?\"    \"Quite.\"    He listened again:    \"The secretary to the head of the criminal investigation department? Oh,  excellent! Mr. Secretary, I have on several occasions been in communication  with M. Dudouis and have given him information which has been of great use  to him. He is sure to remember Prince Renine. I may be able to-day to show  him where the sixty thousand-franc notes are hidden which Aubrieux the  murderer stole from his cousin. If he's interested in the proposal, beg him  to send an inspector to the Brasserie Lutetia, Place des Ternes. I shall  be there with a lady and M. Dutreuil, Aubrieux's friend. Good day, Mr.  Secretary.\"    When Renine hung up the instrument, he saw the amazed faces of Hortense and  of Gaston Dutreuil confronting him.    Hortense whispered:    \"Then you know? You've discovered ...?\"    \"Nothing,\" he said, laughing.    \"Well?\"    \"Well, I'm acting as though I knew. It's not a bad method. Let's have some  lunch, shall we?\"    The clock marked a quarter to one.    \"The man from the prefecture will be here,\" he said, \"in twenty minutes at  latest.\"    \"And if no one comes?\" Hortense objected.    \"That would surprise me. Of course, if I had sent a message to M. Dudouis  saying, 'Aubrieux is innocent,' I should have failed to make any  impression. It's not the least use, on the eve of an execution, to attempt  to convince the gentry of the police or of the law that a man condemned  to death is innocent. No. From henceforth Jacques Aubrieux belongs to  the executioner. But the prospect of securing the sixty bank-notes is a  windfall worth taking a little trouble over. Just think: that was the  weak point in the indictment, those sixty notes which they were unable  to trace.\"    \"But, as you know nothing of their whereabouts....\"    \"My dear girl--I hope you don't mind my calling you so?--my dear girl, when  a man can't explain this or that physical phenomenon, he adopts some sort  of theory which explains the various manifestations of the phenomenon and  says that everything happened as though the theory were correct. That's  what I am doing.\"    \"That amounts to saying that you are going upon a supposition?\"    Renine did not reply. Not until some time later, when lunch was over, did  he say:    \"Obviously I am going upon a supposition. If I had several days before me,  I should take the trouble of first verifying my theory, which is based upon  intuition quite as much as upon a few scattered facts. But I have only two  hours; and I am embarking on the unknown path as though I were certain that  it would lead me to the truth.\"    \"And suppose you are wrong?\"    \"I have no choice. Besides, it is too late. There's a knock. Oh, one word  more! Whatever I may say, don't contradict me. Nor you, M. Dutreuil.\"    He opened the door. A thin man, with a red imperial, entered:    \"Prince Renine?\"    \"Yes, sir. You, of course, are from M. Dudouis?\"    \"Yes.\"    And the newcomer gave his name:    \"Chief-inspector Morisseau.\"    \"I am obliged to you for coming so promptly, Mr. Chief-inspector,\" said  Prince Renine, \"and I hope that M. Dudouis will not regret having placed  you at my disposal.\"    \"At your entire disposal, in addition to two inspectors whom I have left in  the square outside and who have been in the case, with me, from the first.\"    \"I shall not detain you for any length of time,\" said Renine, \"and I will  not even ask you to sit down. We have only a few minutes in which to settle  everything. You know what it's all about?\"    \"The sixty thousand-franc notes stolen from M. Guillaume. I have the  numbers here.\"    Renine ran his eyes down the slip of paper which the chief-inspector handed  him and said:    \"That's right. The two lists agree.\"    Inspector Morisseau seemed greatly excited:    \"The chief attaches the greatest importance to your discovery. So you will  be able to show me?...\"    Renine was silent for a moment and then declared:    \"Mr. Chief-inspector, a personal investigation--and a most exhaustive  investigation it was, as I will explain to you presently--has revealed  the fact that, on his return from Suresnes, the murderer, after replacing  the motor-cycle in the shed in the Avenue du Roule, ran to the Ternes and  entered this house.\"    \"This house?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But what did he come here for?\"    \"To hide the proceeds of his theft, the sixty bank-notes.\"    \"How do you mean? Where?\"    \"In a flat of which he had the key, on the fifth floor.\"    Gaston Dutreuil exclaimed, in amazement:    \"But there's only one flat on the fifth floor and that's the one I live  in!\"    \"Exactly; and, as you were at the cinema with Madame Aubrieux and her  mother, advantage was taken of your absence....\"    \"Impossible! No one has the key except myself.\"    \"One can get in without a key.\"    \"But I have seen no marks of any kind.\"    Morisseau intervened:    \"Come, let us understand one another. You say the bank-notes were hidden in  M. Dutreuil's flat?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then, as Jacques Aubrieux was arrested the next morning, the notes ought  to be there still?\"    \"That's my opinion.\"    Gaston Dutreuil could not help laughing:    \"But that's absurd! I should have found them!\"    \"Did you look for them?\"    \"No. But I should have come across them at any moment. The place isn't big  enough to swing a cat in. Would you care to see it?\"    \"However small it may be, it's large enough to hold sixty bits of paper.\"    \"Of course, everything is possible,\" said Dutreuil. \"Still, I must repeat  that nobody, to my knowledge, has been to my rooms; that there is only one  key; that I am my own housekeeper; and that I can't quite understand....\"    Hortense too could not understand. With her eyes fixed on Prince Renine's,  she was trying to read his innermost thoughts. What game was he playing?  Was it her duty to support his statements? She ended by saying:    \"Mr. Chief-inspector, since Prince Renine maintains that the notes have  been put away upstairs, wouldn't the simplest thing be to go and look? M.  Dutreuil will take us up, won't you?\"    \"This minute,\" said the young man. \"As you say, that will be simplest.\"    They all four climbed the five storys of the house and, after Dutreuil  had opened the door, entered a tiny set of chambers consisting of a  sitting-room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, all arranged with fastidious  neatness. It was easy to see that every chair in the sitting-room occupied  a definite place. The pipes had a rack to themselves; so had the matches.  Three walking-sticks, arranged according to their length, hung from  three nails. On a little table before the window a hat-box, filled with  tissue-paper, awaited the felt hat which Dutreuil carefully placed in it.  He laid his gloves beside it, on the lid.    He did all this with sedate and mechanical movements, like a man who loves  to see things in the places which he has chosen for them. Indeed, no sooner  did Renine shift something than Dutreuil made a slight gesture of protest,  took out his hat again, stuck it on his head, opened the window and rested  his elbows on the sill, with his back turned to the room, as though he were  unable to bear the sight of such vandalism.    \"You're positive, are you not?\" the inspector asked Renine.    \"Yes, yes, I'm positive that the sixty notes were brought here after the  murder.\"    \"Let's look for them.\"    This was easy and soon done. In half an hour, not a corner remained  unexplored, not a knick-knack unlifted.    \"Nothing,\" said Inspector Morisseau. \"Shall we continue?\"    \"No,\" replied Renine, \"The notes are no longer here.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that they have been removed.\"    \"By whom? Can't you make a more definite accusation?\"    Renine did not reply. But Gaston Dutreuil wheeled round. He was choking  and spluttered:    \"Mr. Inspector, would you like _me_ to make the accusation more  definite, as conveyed by this gentleman's remarks? It all means that  there's a dishonest man here, that the notes hidden by the murderer were  discovered and stolen by that dishonest man and deposited in another and  safer place. That is your idea, sir, is it not? And you accuse me of  committing this theft don't you?\"    He came forward, drumming his chest with his fists: \"Me! Me! I found the  notes, did I, and kept them for myself? You dare to suggest that!\"    Renine still made no reply. Dutreuil flew into a rage and, taking Inspector  Morisseau aside, exclaimed:    \"Mr. Inspector, I strongly protest against all this farce and against  the part which you are unconsciously playing in it. Before your arrival,  Prince Renine told this lady and myself that he knew nothing, that he was  venturing into this affair at random and that he was following the first  road that offered, trusting to luck. Do you deny it, sir?\"    Renine did not open his lips.    \"Answer me, will you? Explain yourself; for, really, you are putting  forward the most improbable facts without any proof whatever. It's easy  enough to say that I stole the notes. And how were you to know that they  were here at all? Who brought them here? Why should the murderer choose  this flat to hide them in? It's all so stupid, so illogical and absurd!...  Give us your proofs, sir ... one single proof!\"    Inspector Morisseau seemed perplexed. He questioned Renine with a glance.  Renine said:    \"Since you want specific details, we will get them from Madame Aubrieux  herself. She's on the telephone. Let's go downstairs. We shall know all  about it in a minute.\"    Dutreuil shrugged his shoulders:    \"As you please; but what a waste of time!\"    He seemed greatly irritated. His long wait at the window, under a blazing  sun, had thrown him into a sweat.

I looked again, but saw nothing. I never visit  this building alone, or at night, without being reminded of the fate  of my father. There was nothing wonderful in this appearance; yet it  suggested something more than mere solitude and darkness in the same  place would have done.    \"I kept on my way. The images that haunted me were solemn; and I  entertained an imperfect curiosity, but no fear, as to the nature of  this object. I had ascended the hill little more than half way, when a  voice called me from behind. The accents were clear, distinct, powerful,  and were uttered, as I fully believed, by my wife. Her voice is  not commonly so loud. She has seldom occasion to exert it, but,  nevertheless, I have sometimes heard her call with force and eagerness.  If my ear was not deceived, it was her voice which I heard.    \"Stop, go no further. There is danger in your path.\" The suddenness  and unexpectedness of this warning, the tone of alarm with which it was  given, and, above all, the persuasion that it was my wife who spoke,  were enough to disconcert and make me pause. I turned and listened to  assure myself that I was not mistaken. The deepest silence succeeded. At  length, I spoke in my turn. Who calls? is it you, Catharine? I stopped  and presently received an answer. \"Yes, it is I; go not up; return  instantly; you are wanted at the house.\" Still the voice was  Catharine's, and still it proceeded from the foot of the stairs.    \"What could I do? The warning was mysterious. To be uttered by Catharine  at a place, and on an occasion like these, enhanced the mystery. I could  do nothing but obey. Accordingly, I trod back my steps, expecting that  she waited for me at the bottom of the hill. When I reached the  bottom, no one was visible. The moon-light was once more universal and  brilliant, and yet, as far as I could see no human or moving figure  was discernible. If she had returned to the house, she must have used  wondrous expedition to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye.  I exerted my voice, but in vain. To my repeated exclamations, no answer  was returned.    \"Ruminating on these incidents, I returned hither. There was no room  to doubt that I had heard my wife's voice; attending incidents were not  easily explained; but you now assure me that nothing extraordinary has  happened to urge my return, and that my wife has not moved from her  seat.\"    Such was my brother's narrative. It was heard by us with different  emotions. Pleyel did not scruple to regard the whole as a deception of  the senses. Perhaps a voice had been heard; but Wieland's imagination  had misled him in supposing a resemblance to that of his wife, and  giving such a signification to the sounds. According to his custom  he spoke what he thought. Sometimes, he made it the theme of grave  discussion, but more frequently treated it with ridicule. He did not  believe that sober reasoning would convince his friend, and gaiety, he  thought, was useful to take away the solemnities which, in a mind like  Wieland's, an accident of this kind was calculated to produce.    Pleyel proposed to go in search of the letter. He went and speedily  returned, bearing it in his hand. He had found it open on the pedestal;  and neither voice nor visage had risen to impede his design.    Catharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of good sense; but her  mind was accessible, on this quarter, to wonder and panic. That her  voice should be thus inexplicably and unwarrantably assumed, was a  source of no small disquietude. She admitted the plausibility of the  arguments by which Pleyel endeavoured to prove, that this was no more  than an auricular deception; but this conviction was sure to be shaken,  when she turned her eyes upon her husband, and perceived that Pleyel's  logic was far from having produced the same effect upon him.    As to myself, my attention was engaged by this occurrence. I could not  fail to perceive a shadowy resemblance between it and my father's death.  On the latter event, I had frequently reflected; my reflections never  conducted me to certainty, but the doubts that existed were not of a  tormenting kind. I could not deny that the event was miraculous, and  yet I was invincibly averse to that method of solution. My wonder was  excited by the inscrutableness of the cause, but my wonder was unmixed  with sorrow or fear. It begat in me a thrilling, and not unpleasing  solemnity. Similar to these were the sensations produced by the recent  adventure.    But its effect upon my brother's imagination was of chief moment.  All that was desirable was, that it should be regarded by him with  indifference. The worst effect that could flow, was not indeed very  formidable. Yet I could not bear to think that his senses should be the  victims of such delusion. It argued a diseased condition of his frame,  which might show itself hereafter in more dangerous symptoms. The will  is the tool of the understanding, which must fashion its conclusions  on the notices of sense. If the senses be depraved, it is impossible to  calculate the evils that may flow from the consequent deductions of the  understanding.    I said, this man is of an ardent and melancholy character. Those ideas  which, in others, are casual or obscure, which are entertained in  moments of abstraction and solitude, and easily escape when the scene is  changed, have obtained an immoveable hold upon his mind. The conclusions  which long habit has rendered familiar, and, in some sort, palpable to  his intellect, are drawn from the deepest sources. All his actions and  practical sentiments are linked with long and abstruse deductions  from the system of divine government and the laws of our intellectual  constitution. He is, in some respects, an enthusiast, but is fortified  in his belief by innumerable arguments and subtilties.    His father's death was always regarded by him as flowing from a direct  and supernatural decree. It visited his meditations oftener than it did  mine. The traces which it left were more gloomy and permanent. This new  incident had a visible effect in augmenting his gravity. He was less  disposed than formerly to converse and reading. When we sifted his  thoughts, they were generally found to have a relation, more or less  direct, with this incident. It was difficult to ascertain the exact  species of impression which it made upon him. He never introduced the  subject into conversation, and listened with a silent and half-serious  smile to the satirical effusions of Pleyel.    One evening we chanced to be alone together in the temple. I seized that  opportunity of investigating the state of his thoughts. After a pause,  which he seemed in no wise inclined to interrupt, I spoke to him--\"How  almost palpable is this dark; yet a ray from above would dispel it.\"  \"Ay,\" said Wieland, with fervor, \"not only the physical, but moral night  would be dispelled.\" \"But why,\" said I, \"must the Divine Will address  its precepts to the eye?\" He smiled significantly. \"True,\" said he, \"the  understanding has other avenues.\" \"You have never,\" said I, approaching  nearer to the point--\"you have never told me in what way you considered  the late extraordinary incident.\" \"There is no determinate way in which  the subject can be viewed. Here is an effect, but the cause is utterly  inscrutable. To suppose a deception will not do. Such is possible, but  there are twenty other suppositions more probable. They must all be set  aside before we reach that point.\" \"What are these twenty suppositions?\"  \"It is needless to mention them. They are only less improbable than  Pleyel's. Time may convert one of them into certainty. Till then it is  useless to expatiate on them.\"        Chapter V      Some time had elapsed when there happened another occurrence, still more  remarkable. Pleyel, on his return from Europe, brought information of  considerable importance to my brother. My ancestors were noble Saxons,  and possessed large domains in Lusatia. The Prussian wars had destroyed  those persons whose right to these estates precluded my brother's.  Pleyel had been exact in his inquiries, and had discovered that, by the  law of male-primogeniture, my brother's claims were superior to those  of any other person now living. Nothing was wanting but his presence in  that country, and a legal application to establish this claim.    Pleyel strenuously recommended this measure. The advantages he thought  attending it were numerous, and it would argue the utmost folly to  neglect them. Contrary to his expectation he found my brother averse  to the scheme. Slight efforts, he, at first, thought would subdue his  reluctance; but he found this aversion by no means slight. The interest  that he took in the happiness of his friend and his sister, and his own  partiality to the Saxon soil, from which he had likewise sprung, and  where he had spent several years of his youth, made him redouble his  exertions to win Wieland's consent. For this end he employed every  argument that his invention could suggest. He painted, in attractive  colours, the state of manners and government in that country, the  security of civil rights, and the freedom of religious sentiments. He  dwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank, and drew from the servile  condition of one class, an argument in favor of his scheme, since the  revenue and power annexed to a German principality afford so large a  field for benevolence. The evil flowing from this power, in malignant  hands, was proportioned to the good that would arise from the virtuous  use of it. Hence, Wieland, in forbearing to claim his own, withheld all  the positive felicity that would accrue to his vassals from his success,  and hazarded all the misery that would redound from a less enlightened  proprietor.    It was easy for my brother to repel these arguments, and to shew that no  spot on the"]]]
