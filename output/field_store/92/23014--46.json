[Illustration: Fig. 17.]    \"The aberration produced with diverging rays by a piece of flat and  parallel glass, such as would be used for covering an object, is  represented at Fig. 17, where G G G G is the refracting medium, or  piece of glass covering the object O; O P, the axis of the pencil,  perpendicular to the flat surfaces; O T, a ray near the axis; and O  T', the extreme ray of the pencil incident on the under surface of the  glass; then T R, T' R', will be the directions of the rays in the  medium, and R E, R' E', those of the emergent rays. Now if the course  of these rays is continued, as by the dotted lines, they will be found  to intersect the axis at different distances, X and Y, from the  surface of the glass; and the distance X Y is the aberration produced  by the medium which, as before stated, interferes with the previously  balanced aberrations of the several lenses composing the  object-glass. There are many cases of this, but the one here selected  serves best to illustrate the principle. I need not encumber the  description with the theoretical determination of this quantity, as it  varies with exceedingly minute circumstances which we cannot  accurately control; such as the distance of the object from the under  side of the glass, and the slightest difference in the thickness of  the glass itself; and if these data could be readily obtained, the  knowledge would be of no utility in making the correction, that being  wholly of a practical nature.    \"If an object-glass is constructed as represented in Fig. 16, where  the posterior combination P and the middle M have together an excess  of negative aberration, and if this be corrected by the anterior  combination A, having an excess of positive aberration, then this  latter combination can be made to act more or less powerfully upon P  and M, by making it approach to or recede from them; for when the  three are in close contact, the distance of the object from the  object-glass is greatest; and consequently the rays from the object  are diverging from a point at a greater distance than when the  combinations are separated; and as a lens bends the rays more, or acts  with greater effect, the more distant the object is from which the  rays diverge, the effect of the anterior combination A upon the other  two, P and M, will vary with its distance from thence. When therefore  the correction of the whole is effected for an opaque object with a  certain distance between the anterior and middle combination, if they  are then put in contact, the distance between the object and  object-glass will be increased; consequently the anterior combination  will act more powerfully, and the whole will have an excess of  positive aberration. Now the effect of the aberration produced by a  piece of flat and parallel glass being of the negative character, it  is obvious that the above considerations suggest the means of  correction by moving the lenses nearer together, till the positive  aberration thereby produced balances the negative aberration caused by  the medium.    \"The preceding refers only to the spherical aberration, but the effect  of the chromatic is also seen when an object is covered with a piece  of glass; for, in the course of my experiments, I observed that it  produced a chromatic thickening of the outline of the Podura and  other delicate scales; and if diverging rays near the axis and at the  margin are projected through a piece of flat parallel glass, with the  various indices of refraction for the different colors, it will be  seen that each ray will emerge separated into a beam consisting of the  component colors of the ray, and that each beam is widely different in  form. This difference, being magnified by the power of the microscope,  readily accounts for the chromatic thickening of the outline just  mentioned. Therefore to obtain the finest definition of extremely  delicate and minute objects, they should be viewed without a covering;  if it be desirable to immerse them in a fluid, they should be covered  with the thinnest possible film of talc, as, from the character of the  chromatic aberration, it will be seen that varying the distances of  the combinations will not sensibly affect the correction; though  object-lenses may be made to include a given fluid or solid medium in  their correction for color.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    \"The mechanism for applying these principles to the correction of an  object-glass under the various circumstances, is represented in Fig.  18, where the anterior lens is set in the end of a tube A A, which  slides on the cylinder B containing the remainder of the combination;  the tube A A, holding the lens nearest the object, may then be moved  upon the cylinder B, for the purpose of varying the distance according  to the thickness of the glass covering the object, by turning the  screwed ring C C, or more simply by sliding the one on the other, and  clamping them together when adjusted. An aperture is made in the tube  A, within which is seen a mark engraved on the cylinder, and on the  edge of which are two marks, a longer and a shorter, engraved upon the  tube. When the mark on the cylinder coincides with the longer mark on  the tube, the adjustment is perfect for an uncovered object; and when  the coincidence is with the short mark, the proper distance is  obtained to balance the aberrations produced by glass one-hundredth of  an inch thick, and such glass can be readily supplied.    \"It is hardly necessary to observe, that the necessity for this  correction is wholly independent of any particular construction of the  object-glass; as in all cases where the object-glass is corrected for  an object uncovered, any covering of glass will create a different  value of aberration to the first lens, which previously balanced the  aberration resulting from the rest of the lenses; and as this  disturbance is effected at the first refraction, it is independent of  the other part of the combination. The visibility of the effect  depends on the distance of the object from the object-glass, the angle  of the pencil transmitted, the focal length of the combination, the  thickness of the glass covering the object, and the general perfection  of the corrections for chromatism and the oblique pencils.    \"With this adjusting object-glass, therefore, we can have the  requisites of the greatest possible distance between the object and  object-glass, an intense and sharply defined image throughout the  field from the large pencil transmitted, and the accurate correction  of the aberrations; also, by the adjustment, the means of preserving  that correction under all the varied circumstances in which it may be  necessary to place an object for the purpose of observation.\"    In the annexed engraving, Fig. 19, we have shown the triple achromatic  object-glass in connection with the eye-piece consisting of the  field-glass F F, and the eye-glass E E, forming together the modern  achromatic microscope. The course of the light is shown by drawing  three rays from the centre and three from each end of the object O.  These rays would, if left to themselves, form an image of the object  at A A, but being bent and converged by the field-glass F F, they form  the image at B B, where a stop is placed to intercept all light except  what is required for the formation of the image. From B B therefore  the rays proceed to the eye-glass exactly as has been described in  reference to the simple microscope and to the compound of two glasses.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    If we stopped here we should convey a very imperfect idea of the  beautiful series of corrections effected by the eye-piece, and which  were first pointed out in detail in a paper on the subject published  by Mr. Varley in the 51st volume of the Transactions of the Society of  Arts. The eye-piece in question was invented by Huyghens for  telescopes, with no other view than that of diminishing the spherical  aberration by producing the refractions at two glasses instead of one,  and of increasing the field of view. It was reserved for Boscovich to  point out that Huyghens had by this arrangement accidentally corrected  a great part of the chromatic aberration, and this subject is further  investigated with much skill in two papers by Professor Airy in the  _Cambridge Philosophical Transactions_, to which we refer the  mathematical reader. These investigations apply chiefly to the  telescope, where the small pencils of light and great distance of the  object exclude considerations which become important in the  microscope, and which are well pointed out in Mr. Varley's paper  before mentioned.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    Let Fig. 20 represent the Huyghenean eye-piece of a microscope; F F  and E E being the field-glass and eye-glass, and L M N the two extreme  rays of each of the three pencils, emanating from the centre and ends  of the object, of which, but for the field-glass, a series of colored  images would be formed from R R to B B; those near R R being red,  those near B B blue, and the intermediate ones green, yellow, and so  on, corresponding with the colors of the prismatic spectrum. This  order of colors, it will be observed, is the reverse of that  described in treating of the common compound microscope (Fig. 12), in  which the single object-glass projected the red image beyond the blue.  The effect just described, of projecting the blue image beyond the  red, is purposely produced for reasons presently to be given, and is  called over-correcting the object-glass as to color. It is to be  observed also that the images B B and R R are curved in the wrong  direction to be distinctly seen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#7)"],[1,"n, not being able to restrain the curiosity, which  was also felt by Rodrigo, although the image of Ximena was not for a  moment absent from his mind.    \"I shall do so with much pleasure, courteous squire,\" replied the  maiden; \"for if the knowledge that I was forcibly carried away has been  sufficient to induce this good knight to run to my succour, he will feel  better pleased for having performed that kind action when he shall have  learned more of my misfortunes.\"    \"Relate them to us, relate them to us,\" said Rodrigo, impatient to hear  the adventures of his prot['e]g['e]e, whose gentleness and beauty had much  struck him.    The young girl hastened to comply, saying, \"God gave me very honourable  parents, although their position was only that of peasants, and I always  dwelt with them at Carrion, in this neighbourhood. They were vassals of  Don Suero, and although continually crushed down by the exactions of the  count, demanding constantly contributions from them, in which went the  greater part of the fruits of their toil, they nevertheless lived  contented; for the love which my parents had for each other made all  their troubles bearable, and even sweet. I was born, the sole fruit of  their marriage, and they loved me with such tenderness that, if I were  removed from their side, life would have no charm left for them. To  relate all the care they lavished on me, until I completed my fourteenth  year, would be a never-ending story; I believe that the poor love better  than the rich, for, since love is one of the pleasures, and perhaps the  only one, which is not forbidden them, they devote themselves to it with  all the strength of their souls. Poor as they were, my parents managed  to give me an education much better than is usually received by girls of  my position. Whether it was for that reason, or on account of the great  care with which my mother guarded me, it is certain that I was always  preferred to my companions by the young men, when we danced on the  threshing-floors on Sunday evenings, when they sang in our praise under  the windows, and when they returned from the woods with branches covered  with May bloom, which they stuck in the ground near the doors of the  houses. Near our house lived a young man, named Martin, who, amongst all  those of his age, distinguished himself by the affection which he  manifested for me, and by his many good qualities, especially by his  kindly disposition and his valour. For my part, I grew to love him very  much, as also did my parents; having demanded from them my hand, as he  knew that my heart was his, they willingly assented, and the day of our  marriage was arranged. You cannot know how much Don Suero was hated in  the district, both by the nobles and by the country-people, on account  of his tyranny as well as of his evil life, the report of which more  than once reached the ears of the king. He, however, had not found an  opportunity to punish him, as Don Suero is as powerful as he is cunning  and daring. Not far from Carrion, in a valley covered with gloomy woods,  there is a sanctuary to which, every year, the inhabitants of the  country, for twenty miles round, go on a pilgrimage; and there they  indulge in dances, banquets, and other amusements suitable for such  festivals. This pilgrimage takes place in the pleasantest part of  spring, and the rustic festivities render the joining in it very  delightful. Early in the morning my parents, Martin, his parents, and I  set out from Carrion, and, having arrived at the sanctuary and visited  it with devotion, we retired to refresh ourselves by taking a meal and a  rest under the shade of the trees, seated on the grassy sod, that was  sprinkled over with flowers, which delighted us with their beauty and  perfume. When our frugal but savoury repast was finished, a poor blind  man approached us, playing a lute. We gave him what remained of our  meal, which he thankfully accepted, also a draught of wine, which put  him in good spirits. We then asked him to play his instrument, in order  that Martin and I might dance to its music. The blind man did as we  requested him, and we danced with much pleasure both to ourselves and to  our parents, who warmly applauded us. Many persons approached, forming a  circle round us; but suddenly the trampling of horses was heard, and all  turned towards the path from whence the sounds proceeded, and then we  all trembled when we saw the Count, Don Suero, who was riding on, not  far from us, with a brilliant company of pages and cavaliers, and who  kept his gaze riveted on me with an attention which terrified me. The  blind man let his instrument fall on the ground when he heard the name  of Don Suero, and began to tremble in such a way that those who were  standing around felt compassion for him. He endeavoured to conceal  himself amongst them, as if the eyes of the count were those of a  basilisk, and he feared lest they might gaze on him. The crowd dispersed  as soon as the music and the dancing, which had attracted them, ceased;  Don Suero and his attendants continued their way, and shortly after our  inquietude had almost disappeared. But not so with the blind man, who  remained there full of terror, listening to the slightest noise which  could be heard about us. We asked him what was the cause of his  inquietude, and this is the lamentable story which he related to us,  from time to time shedding copious tears: 'God, when He took my wife  from me, left me a daughter, and also my eyes, with which I could gaze  upon her beauty, for you cannot imagine how beautiful my Sancha was!  Poor and rich envied me my treasure, for gold and silver and palaces  could not be of so much value to me as my daughter. \"Father,\" she used  to say to me, \"you are the centre of my affections on earth.\"  \"Daughter,\" I used to say to her, \"you will be my glory in this world.\"  Such was I to her, and such was she to me. One day we saw from our  window a cavalier, who, riding across the fields which I cultivated, was  directing his way towards our happy abode. He came up to the door and  asked for a drink of water, for it was the month of July and the sun was  so burning that Sancha and I had returned home from our work, in order  to escape his rays. My daughter handed the water to him, and we invited  him to rest beneath our roof. The cavalier thanked us, but did not  accept our offer. \"You have been hospitable to me,\" he said, \"and I  desire to show you that I am grateful; in exchange for the kindness you  offer me I ask another from you; if at any time you should go to  Carrion, where my estates are, come to the castle which I have there,  and I shall be well pleased to see both of you and extend my hospitality  to you; if you do not so, I shall be much vexed, for it will prove that  you do not trust in my goodwill, as I do in yours.\" We promised to do as  he requested, if the occasion should arise, and the cavalier went off by  the way he came, leaving us delighted with his courtesy, and resolved to  comply with his wishes, if ever we should be in the vicinity of Carrion.  The opportunity came, and it appeared to us that it would be an act of  discourtesy if we were to return home without seeing the count, for the  offering of a favour is of more worth than the acceptance of it. We  proceeded to his castle, and Don Suero received us and entertained us,  not as peasants, which we are, but as if we were kings. He showed us his  magnificent apartments, his richly-wrought furniture, brocades and  tapestries worthy of an emperor, gold and silver vessels, and beds  covered with silk and gold. My Sancha saw damsels there clad like  queens. None of them were as beautiful as she was, but appeared so on  account of the richness of their apparel and the fairness of their  faces, not browned, like hers, by the rays of the sun in summer and the  cold blasts of winter. When so great riches and such luxuries had made  us lament secretly the misery in which we always had lived, without  noticing it until then, the count asked us if we would like to remain in  his palace, where a happy life would await us, compared with that which  we had experienced, and which we should in future experience, working in  the fields. Little would have made us accept his proposal, but my Sancha  and I had heard that ambition, flattery, and calumny, which destroy both  body and soul, reside in palaces, and we resisted the temptation and the  importunities of Don Suero. We took leave of him, expressing our thanks;  but, on reaching the gate of the castle, we found it shut, and when we  were about to call out for someone to open it, two servants of the count  seized on me, and two men on my daughter, and separated us, carrying us  off with violence, Sancha I know not whither, and me into a dark prison  cell. In vain I implored them, in vain I called the count by the name of  traitor, in vain I questioned my jailers, for I remained many months in  my cell, separated from the world, and without a ray of light falling on  my eyes. From time to time I heard the bolts of my dungeon, and a  person--I know not whether it was a man or woman, for the darkness was  always complete, and no voice, except my own, ever sounded--brought to  me the meagre food which prolonged my sad life. One day I took up the  vessel in which water was left for me and raised it to my lips; I found  in it a sweetish liquor, which I drank without distrust; in a short time  I felt a great heaviness coming over my entire body, my senses were  numbed, my eyelids closed, and in a few moments I fell into a heavy  sleep. That sleep must have lasted very long, or at least so it seemed  to me, on account of the torments I suffered during its continuance; at  first there was a horrible nightmare, during which, at one time, my  daughter appeared calling on me, in her desolation, to deliver her from  the count; at another, weeping, in despair, over her lost honour;"]]]
