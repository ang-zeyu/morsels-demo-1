There are stars whose motion  carries them straight toward or straight away from the earth, and such  stars, of course, show no cross motion. But the vast majority are  traveling in paths inclined from a perpendicular to our line of sight.  Taken as a whole, the stars may be said to be flying about like the  molecules in a mass of gas. The discovery of the radial component in  the movements of the stars is due to the spectroscope. If a star is  approaching, its spectral lines are shifted toward the violet end of  the spectrum by an amount depending upon the velocity of approach; if  it is receding, the lines are correspondingly shifted toward the red  end. Spectroscopic observation, then, combined with micrometric  measurements of the cross motion, enables us to detect the real  movement of the star in space. Sometimes it happens that a star's  radial movement is periodically reversed; first it approaches, and  then it recedes. This indicates that it is revolving around a near-by  companion, which is often invisible, and superposed upon this motion  is that of the two stars concerned, which together may be approaching  or receding or traveling across the line of sight. Thus the  complications involved in the stellar motions are often exceedingly  great and puzzling.    Yet another source of complication exists in the movement of our own  star, the sun. There is no more difficult problem in astronomy than  that of disentangling the effects of the solar motion from those of  the motions of the other stars. But the problem, difficult as it is,  has been solved, and upon its solution depends our knowledge of the  speed and direction of the movement of the solar system through space,  for of course the sun carries its planets with it. One element of the  solution is found in the fact that, as a result of perspective, the  stars toward which we are going appear to move apart toward all points  of the compass, while those behind appear to close up together. Then  the spectroscopic principle already mentioned is invoked for studying  the shift of the lines, which is toward the violet in the stars ahead  of us and toward the red in those that we are leaving behind. Of  course the effects of the independent motions of the stars must be  carefully excluded. The result of the studies devoted to this subject  is to show that we are traveling at a speed of twelve to fifteen miles  per second in a northerly direction, toward the border of the  constellations Hercules and Lyra. A curious fact is that the more  recent estimates show that the direction is not very much out of a  straight line drawn from the sun to the star Vega, one of the most  magnificent suns in the heavens. But it should not be inferred from  this that Vega is drawing us on; it is too distant for its gravitation  to have such an effect.    Many unaccustomed thoughts are suggested by this mighty voyage of the  solar system. Whence have we come, and whither do we go? Every year of  our lives we advance at least 375,000,000 miles. Since the traditional  time of Adam the sun has led his planets through the wastes of space  no less than 225,000,000,000 miles, or more than 2400 times the  distance that separates him from the earth. Go back in imagination to  the geologic ages, and try to comprehend the distance over which the  earth has flown. Where was our little planet when it emerged out of  the clouds of chaos? Where was the sun when his ``thunder march''  began? What strange constellations shone down upon our globe when its  masters of life were the monstrous beasts of the ``Age of Reptiles''?  A million years is not much of a span of time in geologic reckoning,  yet a million years ago the earth was farther from its present place  in space than any of the stars with a measurable parallax are now. It  was more than seven times as far as Sirius, nearly fourteen times as  far as Alpha Centauri, three times as far as Vega, and twice as far as  Arcturus. But some geologists demand two hundred, three hundred, even  one thousand million years to enable them to account for the  evolutionary development of the earth and its inhabitants. In a  thousand million years the earth would have traveled farther than from  the remotest conceivable depths of the Milky Way!    Other curious reflections arise when we think of the form of the  earth's track as it follows the lead of the sun, in a journey which  has neither known beginning nor conceivable end. There are probably  many minds which have found a kind of consolation in the thought that  every year the globe returns to the same place, on the same side of  the sun. This idea may have an occult connection with our traditional  regard for anniversaries. When that period of the year returns at  which any great event in our lives has occurred we have the feeling  that the earth, in its annual round, has, in a manner, brought us back  to the scene of that event. We think of the earth's orbit as a  well-worn path which we traverse many times in the course of a  lifetime. It seems familiar to us, and we grow to have a sort of  attachment to it. The sun we are accustomed to regard as a fixed  center in space, like the mill or pump around which the harnessed  patient mule makes his endless circuits. But the real fact is that the  earth never returns to the place in space where it has once quitted.  In consequence of the motion of the sun carrying the earth and the  other planets along, the track pursued by our globe is a vast spiral  in space continually developing and never returning upon its course.  It is probable that the tracks of the sun and the others stars are  also irregular, and possibly spiral, although, as far as can be at  present determined, they appear to be practically straight. Every  star, wherever it may be situated, is attracted by its fellow-stars  from many sides at once, and although the force is minimized by  distance, yet in the course of many ages its effects must become  manifest.    Looked at from another side, is there not something immensely  stimulating and pleasing to the imagination in the idea of so  stupendous a journey, which makes all of us the greatest of travelers?  In the course of a long life a man is transported through space thirty  thousand million miles; Halley's Comet does not travel one-quarter as  far in making one of its immense circuits. And there are adventures on  this voyage of which we are just beginning to learn to take account.  Space is full of strange things, and the earth must encounter some of  them as it advances through the unknown. Many singular speculations  have been indulged in by astronomers concerning the possible effects  upon the earth of the varying state of the space that it traverses.  Even the alternation of hot and glacial periods has sometimes been  ascribed to this source. When tropical life flourished around the  poles, as the remains in the rocks assure us, the needed high  temperature may, it has been thought, have been derived from the  presence of the earth in a warm region of space. Then, too, there is a  certain interest for us in the thought of what our familiar planet has  passed through. We cannot but admire it for its long journeying as we  admire the traveler who comes to us from remote and unexplored lands,  or as we gaze with a glow of interest upon the first locomotive that  has crossed a continent, or a ship that has visited the Arctic or  Antarctic regions. If we may trust the indications of the present  course, the earth, piloted by the sun, has come from the Milky Way in  the far south and may eventually rejoin that mighty band of stars in  the far north.    While the stars in general appear to travel independently of one  another, except when they are combined in binary or trinary systems,  there are notable exceptions to this rule. In some quarters of the sky  we behold veritable migrations of entire groups of stars whose members  are too widely separated to show any indications of revolution about a  common center of gravity. This leads us back again to the wonderful  group of the Pleiades. All of the principle stars composing that group  are traveling in virtually parallel lines. Whatever force set them  going evidently acted upon all alike. This might be explained by the  assumption that when the original projective force acted upon them  they were more closely united than they are at present, and that in  drifting apart they have not lost the impulse of the primal motion. Or  it may be supposed that they are carried along by some current in  space, although it would be exceedingly difficult, in the present  state of our knowledge, to explain the nature of such a current. Yet  the theory of a current has been proposed. As to an attractive center  around which they might revolve, none has been found. Another instance  of similar ``star-drift'' is furnished by five of the seven stars  constituting the figure of the ``Great Dipper.'' In this case the  stars concerned are separated very widely, the two extreme ones by not  less than fifteen degrees, so that the idea of a common motion would  never have been suggested by their aspect in the sky; and the case  becomes the more remarkable from the fact that among and between them  there are other stars, some of the same magnitude, which do not share  their motion, but are traveling in other directions. Still other  examples of the same phenomenon are found in other parts of the sky.  Of course, in the case of compact star-clusters, it is assumed that  all the members share a like motion of translation through space, and  the same is probably true of dense star-swarms and star-clouds.    The whole question of star-drift has lately assumed a new phase, in  consequence of the investigations of Kapteyn, Dyson, and Eddington on  the ``systematic motions of the stars.''

Here he left these wretched criminals to be the strength  and hope, the bone and sinew of the little kingdom which, in his fancy, he  pictured to himself rising under his fostering care in the New World. While  reconnoitring the mainland, probably some part of Nova Scotia, for the  purpose of selecting a suitable location for his intended settlement, a  furious gale swept him from the coast, and, either from necessity or  inclination, he returned to France, leaving his hopeful colonists to a fate  hardly surpassed by that of Selkirk himself, and at the same time  dismissing the bright visions that had so long haunted his mind, of  personal aggrandizement at the head of a colonial establishment.    The next year, 1599, Sieur de Saint Chauvin, of Normandy, a captain in the  royal marine, at the suggestion of Pont Grave, of Saint Malo, an  experienced fur-trader, to whom we have already referred, and who had made  several voyages to the northwest anterior to this, obtained a commission  sufficiently comprehensive, amply providing for a colonial settlement and  the propagation of the Christian faith, with, indeed, all the privileges  accorded by that of the Marquis de la Roche. But the chief and present  object which Chauvin and Pont Grave hoped to attain was the monopoly of the  fur trade, which they had good reason to believe they could at that time  conduct with success. Under this commission, an expedition was accordingly  fitted out and sailed for Tadoussac. Successful in its main object, with a  full cargo of valuable furs, they returned to France in the autumn,  leaving, however, sixteen men, some of whom perished during the winter,  while the rest were rescued from the same fate by the charity of the  Indians. In the year 1600, Chauvin made another voyage, which was equally  remunerative, and a third had been projected on a much broader scale, when  his death intervened and prevented its execution.    The death of Sieur de Chauvin appears to have vacated his commission, at  least practically, opening the way for another, which was obtained by the  Commander de Chastes, whose expedition, accompanied by Champlain, as we  have already seen, left Honfleur on the 15th of March, 1603. It consisted  of two barques of twelve or fifteen tons, one commanded by Pont Grave, and  the other by Sieur Prevert, of Saint Malo, and was probably accompanied by  one or more advice-boats. They took with them two Indians who had been in  France some time, doubtless brought over by De Chauvin on his last voyage.  With favoring winds, they soon reached the banks of Newfoundland, sighted  Cape Ray, the northern point of the Island of Cape Breton, Anticosti and  Gaspe, coasting along the southern side of the river Saint Lawrence as far  as the Bic, where, crossing over to the northern shore, they anchored in  the harbor of Tadoussac. After reconnoitring the Saguenay twelve or fifteen  leagues, leaving their vessels at Tadoussac, where an active fur trade was  in progress with the Indians, they proceeded up the St. Lawrence in a light  boat, passed Quebec, the Three Rivers, Lake St. Peter, the Richelieu, which  they called the river of the Iroquois, making an excursion up this stream  five or six leagues, and then, continuing their course, passing Montreal,  they finally cast anchor on the northern side, at the foot of the Falls of  St. Louis, not being able to proceed further in their boat.    Having previously constructed a skiff for the purpose, Pont Grave and  Champlain, with five sailors and two Indians with a canoe, attempted to  pass the falls. But after a long and persevering trial, exploring the  shores on foot for some miles, they found any further progress quite  impossible with their present equipment. They accordingly abandoned the  undertaking and set out on their return to Tadoussac. They made short stops  at various points, enabling Champlain to pursue his investigations with  thoroughness and deliberation. He interrogated the Indians as to the course  and extent of the St. Lawrence, as well as that of the other large rivers,  the location of the lakes and falls, and the outlines and general features  of the country, making rude drawings or maps to illustrate what the Indians  found difficult otherwise to explain. [31]    The savages also exhibited to them specimens of native copper, which they  represented as having been obtained from the distant north, doubtless from  the neighborhood of Lake Superior. On reaching Tadoussac, they made another  excursion in one of the barques as far as Gaspe, observing the rivers,  bays, and coves along the route. When they had completed their trade with  the Indians and had secured from them a valuable collection of furs, they  commenced their return voyage to France, touching at several important  points, and obtaining from the natives some general hints in regard to the  existence of certain mines about the head waters of the Bay of Fundy.    Before leaving, one of the Sagamores placed his son in charge of Pont  Grave, that he might see the wonders of France, thus exhibiting a  commendable appreciation of the advantages of foreign travel. They also  obtained the gift of an Iroquois woman, who had been taken in war, and was  soon to be immolated as one of the victims at a cannibal feast. Besides  these, they took with them also four other natives, a man from the coast of  La Cadie, and a woman and two boys from Canada.    The two little barques left Gaspe on the 24th of August; on the 5th of  September they were at the fishing stations on the Grand Banks, and on the  20th of the same month arrived at Havre de Grace, having been absent six  months and six days.    Champlain received on his arrival the painful intelligence that the  Commander de Chastes, his friend and patron, under whose auspices the late  expedition had been conducted, had died on the 13th of May preceding. This  event was a personal grief as well as a serious calamity to him, as it  deprived him of an intimate and valued friend, and cast a cloud over the  bright visions that floated before him of discoveries and colonies in the  New World. He lost no time in repairing to the court, where he laid before  his sovereign, Henry IV., a map constructed by his own hand of the regions  which he had just visited, together with a very particular narrative of the  voyage.    This \"petit discours,\" as Champlain calls it, is a clear, compact,  well-drawn paper, containing an account of the character and products of  the country, its trees, plants, fruits, and vines, with a description of  the native inhabitants, their mode of living, their clothing, food and its  preparation, their banquets, religion, and method of burying their dead,  with many other interesting particulars relating to their habits and  customs.    Henry IV. manifested a deep interest in Champlain's narrative. He listened  to its recital with great apparent satisfaction, and by way of  encouragement promised not to abandon the undertaking, but to continue to  bestow upon it his royal favor and patronage.    There chanced at this time to be residing at court, a Huguenot gentleman  who had been a faithful adherent of Henry IV. in the late war, Pierre du  Guast, Sieur de Monts, gentleman ordinary to the king's chamber, and  governor of Pons in Saintonge. This nobleman had made a trip for pleasure  or recreation to Canada with De Chauvin, several years before, and had  learned something of the country, and especially of the advantages of the  fur trade with the Indians. He was quite ready, on the death of De Chastes,  to take up the enterprise which, by this event, had been brought to a  sudden and disastrous termination. He immediately devised a scheme for the  establishment of a colony under the patronage of a company to be composed  of merchants of Rouen, Rochelle, and of other places, their contributions  for covering the expense of the enterprise to be supplemented, if not  rendered entirely unnecessary, by a trade in furs and peltry to be  conducted by the company.    In less than two months after the return of the last expedition, De Monts  had obtained from Henry IV., though contrary to the advice of his most  influential minister, [32] a charter constituting him the king's lieutenant  in La Cadie, with all necessary and desirable powers for a colonial  settlement. The grant included the whole territory lying between the 40th  and 46th degrees of north latitude. Its southern boundary was on a parallel  of Philadelphia, while its northern was on a line extended due west from  the most easterly point of the Island of Cape Breton, cutting New Brunswick  on a parallel near Fredericton, and Canada near the junction of the river  Richelieu and the St. Lawrence. It will be observed that the parts of New  France at that time best known were not included in this grant, viz., Lake  St. Peter, Three Rivers, Quebec, Tadoussac, Gaspe, and the Bay Chaleur.  These were points of great importance, and had doubtless been left out of  the charter by an oversight arising from an almost total want of a definite  geographical knowledge of our northern coast. Justly apprehending that the  places above mentioned might not be included within the limits of his  grant, De Monts obtained, the next month, an extension of the bounds of his  exclusive right of trade, so that it should comprehend the whole region of  the gulf and river of St. Lawrence. [33]    The following winter, 1603-4, was devoted by De Monts to organizing his  company, the collection of a suitable band of colonists, and the necessary  preparations for the voyage. His commission authorized him to seize any  idlers in the city or country, or even convicts condemned to  transportation, to make up the bone and sinew of the colony. To what extent  he resorted to this method of filling his ranks, we know not. Early in  April he had gathered together about a"]]]
