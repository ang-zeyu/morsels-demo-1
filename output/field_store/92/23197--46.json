They were engrossed in their conversation, and  did not notice me for a moment. With no wish to play the eavesdropper,  I could not help but overhear. They were talking about the generals.  'Yes, I know they're press-agented at eight seventy-five, dear boy,' I  heard Mr. Quhayne say, 'but between you and me and the door-knob that  isn't what they're getting. The German feller's drawing five hundred of  the best, but I could only get four-fifty for the Russian. Can't say  why. I should have thought, if anything, he'd be the bigger draw. Bit  of a comic in his way!' And then he saw me. There was some slight  unpleasantness. In fact, I've got the sack. After it was over I came  away to try and find you. It seemed to me that the information might be  of importance.\"    Clarence's eyes gleamed.    \"You have done splendidly, Private--no, _Corporal_ Biggs. Do not  regret your lost position. The society shall find you work. This news  you have brought is of the utmost--the most vital importance. Dash it!\"  he cried, unbending in his enthusiasm, \"we've got 'em on the hop. If  they aren't biting pieces out of each other in the next day or two, I'm  jolly well mistaken.\"    He rose; then sat down again.    \"Corporal--no, dash it, Sergeant Biggs--you must have something with  me. This is an occasion. The news you have brought me may mean the  salvation of England. What would you like?\"    The other saluted joyfully.    \"I think I'll have another sparkling limado, thanks, awfully,\" he said.    The beverage arrived. They raised their glasses.    \"To England,\" said Clarence simply.    \"To England,\" echoed his subordinate.           *       *       *       *       *    Clarence left the shop with swift strides, and hurried, deep in  thought, to the offices of the _Encore_ in Wellington Street.    \"Yus?\" said the office-boy interrogatively.    Clarence gave the Scout's Siquand, the pass-word. The boy's demeanour  changed instantly. He saluted with the utmost respect.    \"I wish to see the Editor,\" said Clarence.    A short speech, but one that meant salvation for the motherland.          Chapter 5    SEEDS OF DISCORD      The days following Clarence's visit to the offices of the _Encore_  were marked by a growing feeling of unrest, alike among invaded and  invaders. The first novelty and excitement of the foreign occupation of  the country was beginning to wear off, and in its place the sturdy  independence so typical of the British character was reasserting  itself. Deep down in his heart the genuine Englishman has a rugged  distaste for seeing his country invaded by a foreign army. People were  asking themselves by what right these aliens had overrun British soil.  An ever-growing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the  nation.    It is probable that the departure of Sir Harry Lauder first brought  home to England what this invasion might mean. The great comedian, in  his manifesto in the _Times_, had not minced his words. Plainly  and crisply he had stated that he was leaving the country because the  music-hall stage was given over to alien gowks. He was sorry for  England. He liked England. But now, all he could say was, \"God bless  you.\" England shuddered, remembering that last time he had said, \"God  bless you till I come back.\"    Ominous mutterings began to make themselves heard.    Other causes contributed to swell the discontent. A regiment of  Russians, out route-marching, had walked across the bowling-screen at  Kennington Oval during the Surrey _v._ Lancashire match, causing  Hayward to be bowled for a duck's-egg. A band of German sappers had dug  a trench right across the turf at Queen's Club.    The mutterings increased.    Nor were the invaders satisfied and happy. The late English summer had  set in with all its usual severity, and the Cossacks, reared in the  kindlier climate of Siberia, were feeling it terribly. Colds were the  rule rather than the exception in the Russian lines. The coughing of  the Germans at Tottenham could be heard in Oxford Street.    The attitude of the British public, too, was getting on their nerves.  They had been prepared for fierce resistance. They had pictured the  invasion as a series of brisk battles--painful perhaps, but exciting.  They had anticipated that when they had conquered the country they  might meet with the Glare of Hatred as they patrolled the streets. The  Supercilious Stare unnerved them. There is nothing so terrible to the  highly-strung foreigner as the cold, contemptuous, patronising gaze of  the Englishman. It gave the invaders a perpetual feeling of doing the  wrong thing. They felt like men who had been found travelling in a  first-class carriage with a third-class ticket. They became conscious  of the size of their hands and feet. As they marched through the  Metropolis they felt their ears growing hot and red. Beneath the chilly  stare of the populace they experienced all the sensations of a man who  has come to a strange dinner-party in a tweed suit when everybody else  has dressed. They felt warm and prickly.    It was dull for them, too. London is never at its best in early  September, even for the _habitue_. There was nothing to do. Most  of the theatres were shut. The streets were damp and dirty. It was all  very well for the generals, appearing every night in the glare and  glitter of the footlights; but for the rank and file the occupation of  London spelt pure boredom.    London was, in fact, a human powder-magazine. And it was Clarence  Chugwater who with a firm hand applied the match that was to set it in  a blaze.          Chapter 6    THE BOMB-SHELL      Clarence had called at the offices of the _Encore_ on a Friday.  The paper's publishing day is Thursday. The _Encore_ is the Times  of the music-hall world. It casts its curses here, bestows its  benedictions (sparely) there. The _Encore_ criticising the latest  action of the Variety Artists' Federation is the nearest modern  approach to Jove hurling the thunderbolt. Its motto is, \"Cry havoc, and  let loose the performing dogs of war.\"    It so happened that on the Thursday following his momentous visit to  Wellington Street, there was need of someone on the staff of Clarence's  evening paper to go and obtain an interview from the Russian general.  Mr. Hubert Wales had just published a novel so fruity in theme and  treatment that it had been publicly denounced from the pulpit by no  less a person than the Rev. Canon Edgar Sheppard, D.D., Sub-Dean  of His Majesty's Chapels Royal, Deputy Clerk of the Closet and  Sub-Almoner to the King. A morning paper had started the question,  \"Should there be a Censor of Fiction?\" and, in accordance with custom,  editors were collecting the views of celebrities, preferably of those  whose opinion on the subject was absolutely valueless.    All the other reporters being away on their duties, the editor was at a  loss.    \"Isn't there anybody else?\" he demanded.    The chief sub-editor pondered.    \"There is young blooming Chugwater,\" he said.    (It was thus that England's deliverer was habitually spoken of in the  office.)    \"Then send him,\" said the editor.           *       *       *       *       *    Grand Duke Vodkakoff's turn at the Magnum Palace of Varieties started  every evening at ten sharp. He topped the bill. Clarence, having been  detained by a review of the Scouts, did not reach the hall till five  minutes to the hour. He got to the dressing-room as the general was  going on to the stage.    The Grand Duke dressed in the large room with the other male turns.  There were no private dressing-rooms at the Magnum. Clarence sat down  on a basket-trunk belonging to the Premier Troupe of Bounding Zouaves  of the Desert, and waited. The four athletic young gentlemen who  composed the troupe were dressing after their turn. They took no notice  of Clarence.    Presently one Zouave spoke.    \"Bit off to-night, Bill. Cold house.\"    \"Not 'arf,\" replied his colleague. \"Gave me the shivers.\"    \"Wonder how his nibs'll go.\"    Evidently he referred to the Grand Duke.    \"Oh, _'e's_ all right. They eat his sort of swank. Seems to me the  profession's going to the dogs, what with these bloomin' amytoors an'  all. Got the 'airbrush, 'Arry?\"    Harry, a tall, silent Zouave, handed over the hairbrush.    Bill continued.    \"I'd like to see him go on of a Monday night at the old Mogul. They'd  soon show him. It gives me the fair 'ump, it does, these toffs coming  in and taking the bread out of our mouths. Why can't he give us chaps a  chance? Fair makes me rasp, him and his bloomin' eight hundred and  seventy-five o' goblins a week.\"    \"Not so much of your eight hundred and seventy-five, young feller me  lad,\" said the Zouave who had spoken first. \"Ain't you seen the rag  this week?\"    \"Naow. What's in it? How does our advert, look?\"    \"Ow, that's all right, never mind that. You look at 'What the  _Encore_ Would Like to Know.' That's what'll touch his nibs up.\"    He produced a copy of the paper from the pocket of his great-coat which  hung from the door, and passed it to his bounding brother.    \"Read it out, old sort,\" he said.    The other took it to the light and began to read slowly and cautiously,  as one who is no expert at the art.    \"'What the _Encore_ would like to know:--Whether Prince Otto of  Saxe-Pfennig didn't go particularly big at the Lobelia last week? And  Whether his success hasn't compelled Agent Quhayne to purchase a  larger-sized hat? And Whether it isn't a fact that, though they are  press-agented at the same figure, Prince Otto is getting fifty a week  more than Grand Duke Vodkakoff? And If it is not so, why a little bird  has assured us that the Prince is being paid five hundred a week and  the Grand Duke only four hundred and fifty? And, In any case, whether  the Prince isn't worth fifty a week more than his Russian friend?'  Lumme!\"    An awed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#7)"],[1,"?\"    \"It is my private pavilion,\" said Raffles.  \"Disguises?  In some cases  they're half the battle, and it's always pleasant to feel that, if the  worst comes to the worst, you needn't necessarily be convicted under  your own name.  Then they're indispensable in dealing with the fences.  I drive all my bargains in the tongue and raiment of Shoreditch.  If I  didn't there'd be the very devil to pay in blackmail. Now, this  cupboard's full of all sorts of toggery. I tell the woman who cleans  the room that it's for my models when I find 'em.  By the way, I only  hope I've got something that'll fit you, for you'll want a rig for  to-morrow night.\"    \"To-morrow night!\" I exclaimed.  \"Why, what do you mean to do?\"    \"The trick,\" said Raffles.  \"I intended writing to you as soon as I got  back to my rooms, to ask you to look me up to-morrow afternoon; then I  was going to unfold my plan of campaign, and take you straight into  action then and there.  There's nothing like putting the nervous  players in first; it's the sitting with their pads on that upsets their  applecart; that was another of my reasons for being so confoundedly  close.  You must try to forgive me.  I couldn't help remembering how  well you played up last trip, without any time to weaken on it  beforehand.  All I want is for you to be as cool and smart to-morrow  night as you were then; though, by Jove, there's no comparison between  the two cases!\"    \"I thought you would find it so.\"    \"You were right.  I have.  Mind you, I don't say this will be the  tougher job all round; we shall probably get in without any difficulty  at all; it's the getting out again that may flummox us.  That's the  worst of an irregular household!\" cried Raffles, with quite a burst of  virtuous indignation.  \"I assure you, Bunny, I spent the whole of  Monday night in the shrubbery of the garden next door, looking over the  wall, and, if you'll believe me, somebody was about all night long!  I  don't mean the Kaffirs.  I don't believe they ever get to bed at  all--poor devils!  No, I mean Rosenthall himself, and that pasty-faced  beast Purvis.  They were up and drinking from midnight, when they came  in, to broad daylight, when I cleared out.  Even then I left them sober  enough to slang each other.  By the way, they very nearly came to blows  in the garden, within a few yards of me, and I heard something that  might come in useful and make Rosenthall shoot crooked at a critical  moment.  You know what an I. D. B. is?\"    \"Illicit Diamond Buyer?\"    \"Exactly.  Well, it seems that Rosenthall was one.  He must have let it  out to Purvis in his cups. Anyhow, I heard Purvis taunting him with it,  and threatening him with the breakwater at Capetown; and I begin to  think our friends are friend and foe. But about to-morrow night:  there's nothing subtle in my plan.  It's simply to get in while these  fellows are out on the loose, and to lie low till they come back, and  longer.  If possible, we must doctor the whiskey.  That would simplify  the whole thing, though it's not a very sporting game to play; still,  we must remember Rosenthall's revolver; we don't want him to sign his  name on US.  With all those Kaffirs about, however, it's ten to one on  the whiskey, and a hundred to one against us if we go looking for it.  A brush with the heathen would spoil everything, if it did no more.  Besides, there are the ladies--\"    \"The deuce there are!\"    \"Ladies with an _I_, and the very voices for raising Cain.  I fear, I  fear the clamor!  It would be fatal to us.  Au contraire, if we can  manage to stow ourselves away unbeknownst, half the battle will be won.  If Rosenthall turns in drunk, it's a purple diamond apiece.  If he sits  up sober, it may be a bullet instead.  We will hope not, Bunny; and all  the firing wouldn't be on one side; but it's on the knees of the gods.\"    And so we left it when we shook hands in Picadilly--not by any means as  much later as I could have wished.  Raffles would not ask me to his  rooms that night.  He said he made it a rule to have a long night  before playing cricket and--other games.  His final word to me was  framed on the same principle.    \"Mind, only one drink to-night, Bunny.  Two at the outside--as you  value your life--and mine!\"    I remember my abject obedience; and the endless, sleepless night it  gave me; and the roofs of the houses opposite standing out at last  against the blue-gray London dawn.  I wondered whether I should ever  see another, and was very hard on myself for that little expedition  which I had made on my own wilful account.    It was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when we took up  our position in the garden adjoining that of Reuben Rosenthall; the  house itself was shut up, thanks to the outrageous libertine next door,  who, by driving away the neighbors, had gone far towards delivering  himself into our hands.  Practically secure from surprise on that side,  we could watch our house under cover of a wall just high enough to see  over, while a fair margin of shrubs in either garden afforded us  additional protection.  Thus entrenched, we had stood an hour, watching  a pair of lighted bow-windows with vague shadows flitting continually  across the blinds, and listening to the drawing of corks, the clink of  glasses, and a gradual crescendo of coarse voices within.  Our luck  seemed to have deserted us: the owner of the purple diamonds was dining  at home and dining at undue length.  I thought it was a dinner-party.  Raffles differed; in the end he proved right.  Wheels grated in the  drive, a carriage and pair stood at the steps; there was a stampede  from the dining-room, and the loud voices died away, to burst forth  presently from the porch.    Let me make our position perfectly clear.  We were over the wall, at  the side of the house, but a few feet from the dining-room windows.  On  our right, one angle of the building cut the back lawn in two  diagonally; on our left, another angle just permitted us to see the  jutting steps and the waiting carriage.  We saw Rosenthall come  out--saw the glimmer of his diamonds before anything. Then came the  pugilist; then a lady with a head of hair like a bath sponge; then  another, and the party was complete.    Raffles ducked and pulled me down in great excitement.    \"The ladies are going with them,\" he whispered.  \"This is great!\"    \"That's better still.\"    \"The Gardenia!\" the millionaire had bawled.    \"And that's best of all,\" said Raffles, standing upright as hoofs and  wheels crunched through the gates and rattled off at a fine speed.    \"Now what?\" I whispered, trembling with excitement.    \"They'll be clearing away.  Yes, here come their shadows.  The  drawing-room windows open on the lawn.  Bunny, it's the psychological  moment. Where's that mask?\"    I produced it with a hand whose trembling I tried in vain to still, and  could have died for Raffles when he made no comment on what he could  not fail to notice.  His own hands were firm and cool as he adjusted my  mask for me, and then his own.    \"By Jove, old boy,\" he whispered cheerily, \"you look about the greatest  ruffian I ever saw! These masks alone will down a nigger, if we meet  one.  But I'm glad I remembered to tell you not to shave.  You'll pass  for Whitechapel if the worst comes to the worst and you don't forget to  talk the lingo.  Better sulk like a mule if you're not sure of it, and  leave the dialogue to me; but, please our stars, there will be no need.  Now, are you ready?\"    \"Quite.\"    \"Got your gag?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Shooter?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then follow me.\"    In an instant we were over the wall, in another on the lawn behind the  house.  There was no moon. The very stars in their courses had veiled  themselves for our benefit.  I crept at my leader's heels to some  French windows opening upon a shallow veranda.  He pushed.  They  yielded.    \"Luck again,\" he whispered; \"nothing BUT luck! Now for a light.\"    And the light came!    A good score of electric burners glowed red for the fraction of a  second, then rained merciless white beams into our blinded eyes.  When  we found our sight four revolvers covered us, and between two of them  the colossal frame of Reuben Rosenthall shook with a wheezy laughter  from head to foot.    \"Good-evening, boys,\" he hiccoughed.  \"Glad to see ye at last.  Shift  foot or finger, you on the left, though, and you're a dead boy.  I mean  you, you greaser!\" he roared out at Raffles.  \"I know you.  I've been  waitin' for you.  I've been WATCHIN' you all this week!  Plucky smart  you thought yerself, didn't you?  One day beggin', next time shammin'  tight, and next one o' them old pals from Kimberley what never come  when I'm in.  But you left the same tracks every day, you buggins, an'  the same tracks every night, all round the blessed premises.\"    \"All right, guv'nor,\" drawled Raffles; \"don't excite.  It's a fair cop.  We don't sweat to know 'ow you brung it orf.  On'y don't you go for to  shoot, 'cos we 'int awmed, s'help me Gord!\"    \"Ah, you're a knowin' one,\" said Rosenthall, fingering his triggers.  \"But you've struck a knowin'er.\"    \"Ho, yuss, we know all abaht thet!  Set a thief to ketch a thief--ho,  yuss.\"    My eyes had torn themselves from the round black muzzles, from the  accursed diamonds that had been our snare, the pasty pig-face of the  over-fed pugilist, and the flaming cheeks and hook nose of Rosenthall  himself.  I was looking beyond them at the doorway filled with  quivering silk and plush, black faces, white eyeballs, woolly pates.  But a sudden silence recalled my attention to the millionaire.  And  only his nose retained its color.    \"What d'ye mean?\" he whispered with a hoarse oath.  \"Spit it out, or,  by Christmas, I'll drill you!\"    \"Whort price thet brikewater?\" drawled Raffles coolly.    \"Eh?\"    Rosenthall's revolvers were describing widening orbits.    \"Whort price thet brikewater--old _I.D.B._?\"    \"Where"]]]
