So Tamar remained desolate in             her brother Absalom's house.    10:013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very             wroth.    10:013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:             for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister             Tamar.    10:013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had             sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and             Absalom invited all the king's sons.    10:013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy             servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and             his servants go with thy servant.    10:013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now             go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:             howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.    10:013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon             go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with             thee?    10:013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's             sons go with him.    10:013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now             when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto             you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I             commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.    10:013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had             commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat             him up upon his mule, and fled.    10:013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings             came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,             and there is not one of them left.    10:013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the             earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.    10:013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and             said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the             young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the             appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day             that he forced his sister Tamar.    10:013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his             heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon             only is dead.    10:013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted             up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people             by the way of the hill side behind him.    10:013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:             as thy servant said, so it is.    10:013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of             speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up             their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants             wept very sore.    10:013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king             of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.    10:013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three             years.    10:013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:             for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.    10:014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart             was toward Absalom.    10:014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and             said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and             put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,             but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:    10:014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So             Joab put the words in her mouth.    10:014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on             her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O             king.    10:014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she             answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.    10:014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in             the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote             the other, and slew him.    10:014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,             and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may             kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we             will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal             which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name             nor remainder upon the earth.    10:014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I             will give charge concerning thee.    10:014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,             the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king             and his throne be guiltless.    10:014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to             me, and he shall not touch thee any more.    10:014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy             God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to             destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As             the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to             the earth.    10:014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak             one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.    10:014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a             thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this             thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch             home again his banished.    10:014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,             which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect             any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not             expelled from him.    10:014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my             lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:             and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may             be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.    10:014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the             hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out             of the inheritance of God.    10:014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall             now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the             king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will             be with thee.    10:014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from             me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the             woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.    10:014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all             this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my             lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left             from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant             Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of             thine handmaid:    10:014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done             this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an             angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.    10:014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this             thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.    10:014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,             and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant             knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,             in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.    10:014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to             Jerusalem.    10:014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him             not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw             not the king's face.    10:014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as             Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the             crown of his head there was no blemish in him.    10:014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end             that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,             therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at             two hundred shekels after the king's weight.    10:014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,             whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.    10:014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the             king's face.    10:014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;             but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the             second time, he would not come.    10:014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near             mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And             Absalom's servants set the field on fire.    10:014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said             unto him, Wherefore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#7)"],[1,".    18:021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are             the dwelling places of the wicked?    18:021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know             their tokens,    18:021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they             shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.    18:021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him             what he hath done?    18:021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the             tomb.    18:021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man             shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.    18:021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there             remaineth falsehood?    18:022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,    18:022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be             profitable unto himself?    18:022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?             or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?    18:022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee             into judgment?    18:022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?    18:022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and             stripped the naked of their clothing.    18:022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast             withholden bread from the hungry.    18:022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the             honourable man dwelt in it.    18:022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the             fatherless have been broken.    18:022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear             troubleth thee;    18:022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters             cover thee.    18:022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of             the stars, how high they are!    18:022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the             dark cloud?    18:022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he             walketh in the circuit of heaven.    18:022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?    18:022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was             overflown with a flood:    18:022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty             do for them?    18:022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel             of the wicked is far from me.    18:022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh             them to scorn.    18:022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them             the fire consumeth.    18:022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good             shall come unto thee.    18:022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his             words in thine heart.    18:022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou             shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.    18:022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as             the stones of the brooks.    18:022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have             plenty of silver.    18:022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and             shalt lift up thy face unto God.    18:022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,             and thou shalt pay thy vows.    18:022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established             unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.    18:022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting             up; and he shall save the humble person.    18:022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is             delivered by the pureness of thine hands.    18:023:001 Then Job answered and said,    18:023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than             my groaning.    18:023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even             to his seat!    18:023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with             arguments.    18:023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and             understand what he would say unto me.    18:023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he             would put strength in me.    18:023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be             delivered for ever from my judge.    18:023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I             cannot perceive him:    18:023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:             he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:    18:023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I             shall come forth as gold.    18:023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not             declined.    18:023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I             have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary             food.    18:023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul             desireth, even that he doeth.    18:023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many             such things are with him.    18:023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am             afraid of him.    18:023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:    18:023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he             covered the darkness from my face.    18:024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they             that know him not see his days?    18:024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,             and feed thereof.    18:024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the             widow's ox for a pledge.    18:024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide             themselves together.    18:024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their             work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food             for them and for their children.    18:024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the             vintage of the wicked.    18:024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have             no covering in the cold.    18:024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace             the rock for want of a shelter.    18:024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge             of the poor.    18:024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take             away the sheaf from the hungry;    18:024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their             winepresses, and suffer thirst.    18:024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded             crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.    18:024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not             the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.    18:024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,             and in the night is as a thief.    18:024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,             saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.    18:024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for             themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.    18:024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one             know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.    18:024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the             earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.    18:024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave             those which have sinned.    18:024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;             he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken             as a tree.    18:024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not             good to the widow.    18:024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and             no man is sure of life.    18:024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;             yet his eyes are upon their ways.    18:024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought             low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off             as the tops of the ears of corn.    18:024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my             speech nothing worth?    18:025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,    18:025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high             places.    18:025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his             light arise?    18:025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean             that is born of a woman?    18:025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars             are not pure in his sight.    18:025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which             is a worm?    18:026:001 But Job answered and said,    18:026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest             thou the arm that hath no strength?
