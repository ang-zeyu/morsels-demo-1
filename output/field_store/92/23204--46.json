Stir it over the fire, mixing well till the sauce becomes  brown, and then put in your marinaded pieces of rabbit. Add pepper and  salt and cook till each piece is well colored on each side. When they  are well colored, add then the bunch of thyme, the sliced onion and half  the vinegar that you used for soaking; three bay-leaves, one dozen dried  and dry prunes, five lumps of sugar, half a pint of water. Cover closely  and let it simmer for two hours and a half.    [_A Belgian at Droitwich_.]          RABBIT    Put the back and the hind legs of one or two rabbits in an oven,  covering the same first with a layer of butter (half inch thick) and  then with a layer of French mustard, pepper and salt. Roast by a good  fire for one hour, baste often with the juice from the meat and the  gravy.          HARE    To be put in a pan in the oven: sauce, butter, and a quarter of a pint  of cream, pepper, salt and some flour to thicken the sauce. Before the  hare is put in the oven, cover it with a thin piece of bacon, which must  be taken away before the hare is brought to table.    [_Mdlle. Breakers_.]          RUM OMELETTE    This simple dish is much liked by gentlemen. Break five eggs in a basin,  sweeten them with castor sugar, pour in a sherry glassful of rum. Beat  them very hard till they froth. Put a bit of fresh butter in a shallow  pan and pour in your eggs. Let it stay on the fire just three minutes  and then slip it off on to a hot dish. Powder it with sugar, as you take  it to the dining-room. At the dining-room door, set a light to a big  spoonful of rum and pour it over the omelette just as you go in. It is  almost impossible to light a glass of rum in a hurry, for your omelette,  so use a kitchen spoon.          THE CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY DISH    Boil up a quart of milk, sweeten it with nearly half a pound of sugar,  and flavor with vanilla. Let it get cold. Beat up six eggs, both yolks  and whites, mix them with the milk, put it all in a fireproof dish  and cook very gently. Cover the top before you serve it with ratafia  biscuits.          A FRANGIPANI    Put your saucepan on the table and break in it two eggs. Mix these with  two dessertspoonfuls of flour. Add a pint of milk, and put it on the  fire, stirring always one way. Let it cook for a quarter of an hour,  stirring with one hand, while with the other sprinkle in powdered sugar  and ground almonds. Turn out to get cold, and cut in squares.          APRICOT SOUFFLE    This is good enough even for an English \"dinner-party.\" Beat the whites  of six eggs stiffly. Take four dessert-spoonfuls of apricot jam, or an  equal quantity of those dried apricots that have been soaked and stewed  to a puree. If you use jam, you need not add sugar. If you use the dried  apricots, add sugar to sweeten. Butter a dish at the bottom, and when  you have well mixed with a fork the beaten whites and the apricot, put  it in a pyramid on the dish and bake for fifteen minutes in a moderate  oven. Powder with sugar.          STEWED PRUNES    Prunes are very good done this way. Take a pound of prunes, soak them  twenty-four hours in water. Put them on the fire in a cupful of water  and half a bottle of light red wine, quarter of a pound of sugar and,  if you like it, a pinch of cinnamon or mixed spice. Let it all stew till  the liquor is much reduced and the prunes are well flavored. Let them  get cold, and serve them in a glass dish with whipped cream.          CHOCOLATE CREAM    Take the whites of six eggs and beat them stiff, doing first one and  then another, adding to them three soup-spoonfuls of powdered sugar and  three sticks of chocolate that you have grated. If you have powdered  chocolate by you, use that, and taste the mixture to judge when it  is well flavored. Mix it all well in a cool place. To do this dish  successfully, make it just before you wish to serve it.    [_Mdlle. Lust, of Brussels_.]          SEMOLINA SOUFFLE    Boil up two pints of milk and fifteen lumps of sugar with a bit of  vanilla. Add three soup-spoonfuls of semolina, and let it boil for  fifteen minutes, while you stir it. Take it from the fire, and add to it  the yolks of two eggs and their whites that you have beaten stiffly. Put  it in the oven for a quarter of an hour, and serve it hot.    [_Mdlle. Lust, of Brussels_.]          SNOWY MOUNTAINS    Butter six circular rusks, and put on them a layer of jam. Beat the  whites of three eggs and place them on the rusks in the shape of a  pyramide. Put them in the oven and color a little. They must be served  hot.    [_Mdlle. Lust, of Brussels_.]          RICHELIEU RICE    Put three soup-spoonfuls of Carolina rice to swell in a little water,  with a pat of butter. When the rice has absorbed all the water, add a  pint of milk, sugar to sweeten, a few raisins, some chopped orange-peel,  and some crystallized cherries, or any other preserved fruit. Put all  on the fire, and when the mixture is cooked the rice ought to be creamy.  Add the yolk of an egg, stir it well, and pour all into a mold. Put it  to cool. Turn it out, and serve it with the following sauce, which must  be poured on the shape.    A pint of milk, sugar, and vanilla; let it boil. Stir a soup-spoonful of  cornflour in water till it is smooth, mix it with the boiling milk, let  it boil while stirring it for a few minutes, take it from the fire, add  the yolk of an egg, and pour it on the rice shape. Serve when cold.    [_Mdlle. Lust, of Brussels_.]          EXCELLENT PASTE FOR PASTRY    Equal quantities of butter and flour, well mixed in a little beer; add  also a pinch of salt. Make this paste the day before you require it; it  is good for little patties and tarts.    [_Mdlle. Le Kent_.]          CHOCOLATE CREAM    (No. 2)    Melt four penny tablets of chocolate in hot milk until it is liquid and  without lumps. Boil up a pint of milk with a stick of vanilla, a big  lump of butter (size of a walnut) and ten lumps of sugar. When this  boils, add the chocolate and keep stirring continually. Then take the  yolks of three eggs and well beat them; it is better to have these  beaten before, so as not to interfere with the stirring of your mixture.  Add your three yolks and keep on stirring, always in the same way.  Then pour the mixture into a mold that has been rinsed out in very cold  water, and let it stand in a cool place till set.    [_Mrs. Emelie Jones_.]          BELGIAN GINGERBREAD    1/2 pound cornflour 1/4 pound butter 1/4 pound white sugar 1 or 2 eggs  1/2 ounce ginger powder.    Work all the ingredients together on a marble slab, to get the paste  all of the same consistency. Make it into balls as big as walnuts,  flattening them slightly before putting them into the oven. This sort of  gingerbread keeps very well.    [_L. L. B. d'Anvers_.]          APPLE FRITTERS    Put half pound of flour in a deep dish and work it with beer, beating it  well till there are no lumps left. Make it into a paste that is not very  liquid. Peel and core some good apples, cut them into rounds, put them  in the paste so that each one is well covered with it. Have a pan of  boiling fat and throw in the apple slices for two minutes. They ought  to be golden by then, if that fat has been hot enough. Serve them dusted  with powdered sugar and the juice of half a lemon squeezed on them.    [_Mme. Delahaye_.]          FOUR QUARTERS    Weigh four very fresh eggs and put them in an earthenware dish. Add  successively, sieved flour, fine sugar, and fresh butter, each one of  these items being of the same weight of the eggs--hence the name: Four  Quarters. With a wooden spoon, work these four ingredients, then let  them rest for five minutes. Turn it all into a buttered mold and let  it cook for five quarters of an hour in a gentle oven or in a double  saucepan. Turn it out, and eat it either cold or hot and with fruit.    [_Georges Kerckaert_.]          SAFFRON RICE    Wash the rice in cold water, heat it in a little water and add a dust of  salt. Flavor some milk (enough to cover the rice) with vanilla, and pour  it on the rice. Let it cook in the oven for an hour and a quarter. Take  it from the fire, and stir in the yolks only of two eggs, or of one  only, if wished. Sweeten the whole with sugar, and color it with a  little saffron. Turn it out, and let it get very cold.    [_Paquerette_.]          SEMOLINA FRITTERS    Quarter pound semolina, one and a half pints of milk, three eggs. Put  on the milk, and, as soon as it is boiling, drop the semolina in, in a  shower. Let it boil for a few minutes, stirring continually. Then add  the yolks of three eggs, and then the whites, which you have already  beaten stiff. Pour all on a dish, and cool. Have some boiling lard (it  is boiling when it ceases to bubble), and throw into it spoonsful of the  mixture. When they are fried golden, take them out, drain them a moment,  and sprinkle on some white sugar.    [_Mme. Segers_.]          SPECULOOS    (A Brussels recipe)    Pound down half pound flour, four ounces brown sugar, three and a half  ounces butter, a pinch of nutmeg, and the same of mace and cinnamon in  powder. Add, as well, a pinch of bicarbonate of soda. Make the paste  into a ball, and cover it with a fine linen or muslin cloth, and leave  it till the following day. If you have no molds to press it in, cut it  into diamonds or different shapes, and cook them in the oven on buttered  trays. I believe waffle irons can be bought in London.          GAUFRES FROM BRUSSELS    Mix in an earthern bowl half a pint of flour, five yolks of eggs, a  coffee-spoonful of castor sugar, half pint of milk (fresh), adding a  pinch of salt and of vanilla; then two ounces butter melted over hot  water. Then beat up the whites of four eggs very stiffly, and add them.

This  relation of varieties to the parent-species is gradually increasing in  importance in the estimation of botanists, sharply contrasting with  those cases, in which such dependency is not to be met with.    If among the subdivisions of a species, no single one can be pointed out  as playing a primary part, and the others can not be traced back to it,  the relation between these lesser units is of course of another  character. They are to be considered of equal importance. They are  distinguished from each other by more than [36] one character, often by  slight differences in nearly all their organs and qualities. Such forms  have come to be designated as \"elementary species.\" They are only  varieties in a broad and vague systematic significance of the word, not  in the sense accorded to this term in horticultural usage, nor in a  sharper and more scientific conception.    Genera and species are, at the present time, for a large part  artificial, or stated more correctly, conventional groups. Every  systematist is free to delimit them in a wider or in a narrower sense,  according to his judgment. The greater authorities have as a rule  preferred larger genera, others of late have elevated innumerable  subgenera to the rank of genera. This would work no real harm, if  unfortunately, the names of the plants had not to be changed each time,  according to current ideas concerning genera. Quite the same inconstancy  is observed with species. In the Handbook of the British Flora, Bentham  and Hooker describe the forms of brambles under 5 species, while  Babington in his Manual of British Botany makes 45 species out of the  same material. So also in other cases. For instance, the willows which  have 13 species in one and 31 species in the other of these manuals, and  the hawkweeds for which the figures are 7 and 32 [37] respectively.  Other authors have made still greater numbers of species in the same  groups.    It is very difficult to estimate systematic differences on the ground of  comparative studies alone. All sorts of variability occur, and no  individual or small group of specimens can really be considered as a  reliable representative of the supposed type. Many original diagnoses of  new species have been founded on divergent specimens and of course, the  type can afterwards neither be derived from this individual, nor from  the diagnosis given.    This chaotic state of things has brought some botanists to the  conviction that even in systematic studies only direct experimental  evidence can be relied upon. This conception has induced them to test  the constancy of species and varieties, and to admit as real units only  such groups of individuals as prove to be uniform and constant  throughout succeeding generations. The late Alexis Jordan, of Lyons in  France, made extensive cultures in this direction. In doing so, he  discovered that systematic species, as a rule, comprise some lesser  forms, which often cannot easily be distinguished when grown in  different regions, or by comparing dried material. This fact was, of  course, most distasteful to the systematists of his time and even for a  long period afterwards [38] they attempted to discredit it. Milde and  many others have opposed these new ideas with some temporary success.  Only of late has the school of Jordan received due recognition, after  Thuret, de Bary, Rosen and others tested its practices and openly  pronounced for them. Of late Wittrock of Sweden has joined them, making  extensive experimental studies concerning the real units of some of the  larger species of his country.    From the evidence given by these eminent authorities, we may conclude  that systematic species, as they are accepted nowadays, are as a rule  compound groups. Sometimes they consist of two or three, or a few  elementary types, but in other cases they comprise twenty, or fifty, or  even hundreds of constant and well differentiated forms.    The inner constitution of these groups is however, not at all the same  in all cases. This will be seen by the description of some of the more  interesting of them. The European heartsease, from which our  garden-pansies have been chiefly derived, will serve as an example. The  garden-pansies are a hybrid race, won by crossing the _Viola tricolor_  with the large flowered and bright yellow _V. lutea_. They combine, as  everyone knows, in their wide range of [39] varieties, the attributes of  the latter with the peculiarities of the former species.    Besides the _lutea_, there are some other species, nearly allied to  tricolor, as for instance, _cornuta_, _calcarata_, and _altaica_, which  are combined with it under the head of _Melanium_ as a subgenus, and  which together constitute a systematic unity of undoubted value, but  ranging between the common conceptions of genus and species. These forms  are so nearly allied to the heartsease that they have of late been made  use of in crosses, in order to widen the range of variability of  garden-pansies.    _Viola tricolor_ is a common European weed. It is widely dispersed and  very abundant, growing in many localities in large numbers. It is an  annual and ripens its seeds freely, and if opportunity is afforded, it  multiplies rapidly.    _Viola tricolor_ has three subspecies, which have been elevated to the  rank of species by some authors, and which may here be called, for  brevity's sake, by their binary names. One is the typical _V. tricolor_,  with broad flowers, variously colored and veined with yellow, purple and  white. It occurs in waste places on sandy soil. The second is called _V.  arvensis_ or the field-pansy; it has small inconspicuous flowers, with  pale-yellowish petals which are shorter than the sepals. It pollinates  itself without the [40] aid of insects, and is widely dispersed in  cultivated fields. The third form, _V. alpestris_, grows in the Alps,  but is of lesser importance for our present discussion.    Anywhere throughout the central part of Europe _V. tricolor_ and _V.  arvensis_ may be seen, each occupying its own locality. They may be  considered as ranging among the most common native plants of the  particular regions they inhabit. They vary in the color of the flowers,  branching of the stems, in the foliage and other parts, but not to such  an extent as to constitute distinct strains. They have been brought into  cultivation by Jordan, Wittrock and others, but throughout Europe each  of them constitutes a single type.    These types must be very old and constant, fluctuating always within the  same distinct and narrow limits. No slow, gradual changes can have taken  place. In different countries their various habitats are as old as the  historical records, and probably many centuries older. They are quite  independent of one another, the distance being in numerous cases far too  great for the exchange of pollen or of seeds. If slow and gradual  changes were the rule, the types could not have remained so uniform  throughout the whole range of these two species. They would necessarily  have split up into thousands [41] and thousands of minor races, which  would show their peculiar characteristics if tested by cultures in  adjacent beds. This however, is not what happens. As a matter of fact  _V. tricolor_ and _V. arvensis_ are widely distributed but wholly  constant types.    Besides these, there occur distinct types in numerous localities. Some  of them evidently have had time and opportunity to spread more or less  widely and now occupy larger regions or even whole countries. Others are  narrowly limited, being restricted to a single locality. Wittrock  collected seeds or plants from as many localities as possible in  different parts of Sweden and neighboring states and sowed them in his  garden near Stockholm. He secured seeds from his plants, and grew from  them a second, and in many cases a third generation in order to estimate  the amount of variability. As a rule the forms introduced into his  garden proved constant, notwithstanding the new and abnormal conditions  under which they were propagated.    First of all we may mention three perennial forms called by him _Viola  tricolor ammotropha_, _V. tricolor coniophila_ and _V. stenochila_. The  typical _V. tricolor_ is an annual plant; sowing itself in summer and  germinating soon afterwards. The young plants thrive throughout [42] the  latter part of the summer and during the fall, reaching an advanced  stage of development of the branched stems before winter. Early in the  spring the flowers begin to open, but after the ripening of the seeds  the whole plant dies.    The three perennial species just mentioned develop in the same manner in  the first year. During their flowering period, however, and afterwards,  they produce new shoots from the lower parts of the stem. They prefer  dry and sandy soils, often becoming covered with the sand that is blown  on them by the winds. They are prepared for such seemingly adverse  circumstances by the accumulation of food in the older stems and by the  capacity of the new shoots to thrive on this food till they have become  long enough to reach the light. _V. tricolor ammotropha_ is native near  Ystad in Sweden, and the other two forms on Gotland. All three have  narrowly limited habitats.    The typical tricolored heartsease has remained annual in all its other  subspecies. It may be divided into two types in the first place, _V.  tricolor genuina_ and _V. tricolor versicolor_. Both of them have a wide  distribution and seem to be the prototypes from which the rarer forms  must have been derived. Among these latter Wittrock describes seven  local types, which [43] proved to be constant in his pedigree-cultures.  Some of them have produced other forms, related to them in the way of  varieties. They all have nearly the same general habit and do not  exhibit any marked differences in their"]]]
