It was a  long, low building within the precincts of Fort Garry, stocked with  everything either useful or ornamental, from a ship's anchor to a lace  pocket-handkerchief; a sort of curiosity shop of all the necessaries and  luxuries of life; an outfitting establishment where one could not only  clothe oneself from head to foot, but furnish one's house from attic to  cellar, at very reasonable prices. Whatever the charges may be at the  outlying posts, competition keeps them within bounds in Winnipeg. As a  rule the goods are excellent in quality, and to judge by the number of  carts, carriages, and saddle-horses always grouped about the door of the  store, a thriving business is done there.    The Red River at Winnipeg is much wider than at any other point, yet so  high are the banks, that until quite close to it one cannot see the  water. On the opposite or western shore is St. Boniface, the terminus of  the branch line from Selkirk, and the site of the Roman Catholic  cathedral, convents, and schools. The cathedral, a large square building,  has a musical chime of bells, and the ringing of the \"angelus,\" whose  sound floated over the prairie unmarred by steam whistles, factory bells,  or any other of the multitudinous sounds of a large city, was always  welcome. Nowhere is evening more beautiful than in Manitoba. One instance  in particular I noticed. The sun was setting low down in the heavens as  in a sea of gold, one long flame-coloured line alone marking the horizon.  In the south-west rose cloud upon cloud of crimson and gold, crossed by  rapid flashes of pale yellow and white lightning, which momentarily  obliterated their rich colours. To the south was a great bank of black  thunder-cloud crested with crimson, reft to its deepest darkness by  successive flashes of forked lightning. Immediately overhead a narrow  curtain of leaden clouds was driven hither and thither by uncertain  winds; while below, the prairie and all its varied life lay bathed in the  warmth and light of the departing sun, throwing into bold relief the  Indian wigwam, with its ragged sides and cross-poles.    Squaws were seated round the camp fires, or dipping water from a pool  hard by; Indians were standing idly about; droves of cattle were being  driven in for milking; groups of horses, their fore feet tied loosely  together, were hobbling awkwardly as they grazed; tired oxen were  tethered near, feeding after their day's work, while their driver lay  under his cart and smoked. Above the low squat tent of the half-breed,  there rose the brown-roofed barracks, its lazy flag clinging to the  staff. Through the surrounding bushes, water gleamed here and there. In  the distance could be seen long trains of ox-carts, coming from remote  settlements, the low monotonous moan of their ungreased wheels making a  weird accompaniment to the muttering thunder; or a black-robed procession  of nuns, on their way to the small chapel on the prairie, whose tinkling  bell was calling them to prayers. An Indian on his fiery little steed,  his beaded saddle-cloth glistening in the sun, was galloping in mad haste  over the grass, away to the low hills to the north, which deserved their  name of Silver Heights as they received the sun's good-night kiss.    Then the clouds, losing their borrowed tints, closed in like a pall; the  low wail of the wind grew louder as it approached and swept them away to  the south, leaving night to settle down upon the dwellers of the prairie  city, starlit and calm, while the distant glow of the prairie fires rose  luridly against the eastern sky. But all night long the creaking moan of  the ox-carts went on, giving the prairie a yet closer resemblance to \"an  inland sea.\"          CHAPTER V.

The summer passed uneventfully. Day after day we watched for the  white-covered mail-waggon, pails dangling underneath it, dogs trotting  behind, rousing as they passed countless wild brethren from every quarter  of the prairie. At sight of the waggon, we put on our hats and went to the  post-office for letters from home; then drove across the prairie to Silver  Heights, or down to the English cathedral, which stood on the fairest  bend of the river, and in a pretty, wooded dell--but, alas, it was  encircled by a tangled, uncared-for churchyard, overgrown with weeds and  thistles, the tombstones broken and prostrate, the fences so dilapidated  that stray cattle leaped over them and grazed amongst the unrecognized  graves. I was told that arrangements had been made for a city cemetery on  the prairie, but the ground was merely staked off. A man who asked his  way there was directed to go straight across the prairie to the east,  until he came to where grass and sky met. Forgetting that as he advanced  the horizon receded, he thanked his informant, and went on his fruitless  search; but after wandering many hours, like the boy after the pot of  gold at the end of the rainbow, he returned weary and unsuccessful.    At the cathedral we heard the chorister boys chant the evening psalms;  then went on to the little village of Kildonan, standing among green  fields and thriving farms; or turned in another direction across the  Assineboine, up a lovely road leading for miles through the woods. One  morning we went to the emigrant sheds to see several hundred Icelanders  embark in their flat-bottomed boats, with their quaint wooden chests, on  their way to Gimli. On another occasion we helped to organize a  Sunday-school festival, and after giving the children an unlimited supply  of cake, strawberries, and lemonade, we amused them with some  _tableaux_. Taking possession of a disused old church, we made an  _impromptu_ stage; by laying boards across the chancel railings; and  the effect was so good, that some play-loving people enlarged on our idea  by putting up rough side-scenes, and giving a series of entertainments  there during the following winter, with the average amount of amateur  skill.    One very hot Sunday, when we were without a servant, I rashly left our  joint of roast beef on the kitchen table, while we discussed the pudding.  Suddenly an ominous noise was heard. \"Oh, Miss F----!\" exclaimed my  hostess, starting up, \"Do stop that dog! The wretch has stolen the  beef--_all_ to-morrow's dinner!\"    To rush out of the house and over the prairie after the brute was the  work of an instant; not so to catch him. On I ran, urged to redoubled  exertions by Mrs. C----, who pursued me, excitedly flourishing her table  napkin, while her little girl scrambled after her, screaming at being  left behind. Every now and then the dog would stop to take breath,  sitting still with aggravating coolness till I almost touched him, when  off he would start again, at redoubled speed. At last, after wildly  throwing two or three handfuls of stones at him and all the sticks I  could pick up as I passed, I aimed furiously at the barracks and hit the  dog on the head, when he dropped the beef, and I returned, hot and  breathless, but triumphant.    The days were sultry, but the nights cool enough to make a blanket  necessary, except just before the frequent thunderstorms. Well might the  Indians call the province \"Manitoba\" (God speaking), in their awe of the  Great Spirit whose voice alone is so terrible. October is the most  beautiful month in that region, bright, clear, and balmy--the true Indian  summer, with cool, dewy nights, when the aurora sent its long streaks of  white and red light from the horizon to the zenith, to fall again in a  shower of sparks, each night more beautiful than the last. Till, early in  November, a storm of rain, succeeded by snow and frost, ended our Indian  summer, and in forty-eight hours we had winter. Not weeks of slushy snow,  changeable temperature, chilling rains, and foggy skies, as in Ontario,  but cold, frosty, bracing winter at once. By the end of November the  river was blocked, the boats had stopped running, and our only  communication with the outside world was by means of the daily stage. But  the wretchedness of a journey over the prairie to the nearest railway  station was only encountered by those whose business made it unavoidable.    Before navigation had quite ceased, a provincial exhibition of the  agricultural and other products of the country was held in the town-hall.  Many of the vegetables were so large, that a description of them was  treated with incredulity until some specimens were sent to Ottawa, to  be modelled for the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. One Swedish  turnip weighed over thirty-six pounds; some potatoes (early roses and  white) measured nine inches long and seven in circumference; radishes  were a foot and a half long and four inches 'round; kail branched out to  the size of a currant bush; cabbages, hard, white, and good, grew to a  foot and a half in diameter, and there were cauliflowers as large.  Neither Indian corn, melons, nor tomatos were exhibited, chiefly because  most of the farmers in Manitoba have cultivated wheat-growing rather than  market-gardening, as the former brings in the largest returns for the  least labour.    Corn is grown in Manitoba larger and far taller than any I saw in  Ontario. Tomatos will grow in profusion in a dry spot, especially where,  as in Kuwatin, a hundred miles from Winnipeg, a southern exposure on  sandy soil can be found; the same may he said of melons. Fruit trees are  most difficult to cultivate, the frosts being so severe. Yet with care  that obstacle may be overcome, and a few apples, grown and ripened in Mr.  Bannatyne's garden, in Winnipeg, were exhibited.

He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a  large serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in the  tree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles. The  Prince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and  killed the serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in  the air, and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for  their young ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and the  young Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him,  \"Dear boy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by  that cruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children;  whenever you are in need, therefore, send to us and we will help you;  and as for these little eagles, take them, and let them be your  servants.\"    At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their  wings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over  the thick jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle of  palm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of  water. It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great. All  round the trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were  such countless thousands of them, that it would have been quite  impossible for any one to walk through their ranks to the place; down  swooped the strong-winged eaglets--down jumped the Prince; in an  instant he had overthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized  the little green parrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as  he mounted again into the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding  their treasure gone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.    Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the  great tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, \"Take back your  little ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand in  need of help, I will not fail to come to you.\" He then continued his  journey on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace,  where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot.  Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, \"My boy, where  did you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you.\"    But the Prince answered, \"Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a  great pet of mine; I have had it many years.\"    Then the Magician said, \"If it is an old favourite, I can understand  your not caring to give it away; but come what will you sell it for?\"    \"Sir,\" replied the Prince, \"I will not sell my parrot.\"    Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, \"Anything, anything; name what  price you will, and it shall be yours.\" The Prince answered, \"Let the  seven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly  liberated.\"    \"It is done as you desire,\" said the Magician, \"only give me my  parrot.\" And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband and  his brothers resumed their natural shapes. \"Now, give me my parrot,\"  repeated Punchkin.    \"Not so fast, my master,\" rejoined the Prince; \"I must first  beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned.\"    [Illustration: Punchkin's Prisoners are set free.]    The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried,  in an imploring voice, \"Give me my parrot!\" the whole garden became  suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,  stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing  horses, and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants.    \"Give me my parrot!\" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the  parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's  right arm fell off.    Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, \"Give me my parrot!\"  The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's  left arm tumbled off.    \"Give me my parrot!\" cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince  pulled off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off:  the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's  left.    Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still  he rolled his eyes, and cried, \"Give me my parrot!\" \"Take your parrot,  then,\" cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and  threw it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted  round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!    Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven  Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever  afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own  house.          The Broken Pot      There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was  Svabhavak_ri_pa_n_a, which means \"a born miser.\" He had collected a  quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled  a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall,  placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he  thought, \"Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should  be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this  I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six  months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the  goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the  calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the  buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of  horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall  get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house,  and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will  have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman.    [Illustration:]    When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit  with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy  will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be  danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full  of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she,  distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and  give her such a kick with my foot.\" While he thought this, he gave a  kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and  made him quite white. Therefore, I say, \"He who makes foolish plans  for the future will be white all over, like the father of  Somasarman.\"          The Magic Fiddle      Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers  were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family.  It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives  for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length  they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general  provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, \"She  does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home,  and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time.\" They then  called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his  good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, \"At midday when  our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that  on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly  re-appear. In this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow  into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own.\"    At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her,  and she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to  rise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it  would not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and  cry to her brother:    [Illustration:]        \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,      Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"    The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began  to wail again:        \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,      Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"    The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried  again:        \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,      Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"    The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:        \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,      Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"    At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning,  then she cried aloud:        \"Oh! my brother, the water measures a man's height,      Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill.\"    The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was  drowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and  carried her off.    After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of  the tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to  an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way,  seeing it, said to himself, \"This will make a splendid fiddle.\" So one  day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin,  the bamboo called out, \"Do not cut at the root, cut higher up.\" When  he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, \"Do  not cut near the top, cut at the root.\" When the Jogi again prepared  himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, \"Do not cut  at the root, cut higher up;\" and when he was about to cut higher up,  it again called out to him, \"Do not cut high up, cut at the root.\" The  Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him,  so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it  away made a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and  delighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he"]]]
