There's one, anyhow,\" replied the donkey,  sitting upright on its haunches and waving a hoof toward Button-Bright.  \"We saw him coming and thought the whole army of foxes was marching to  attack us.\"    \"Button-Bright isn't a fox,\" explained the shaggy man.  \"He's only  wearing a fox head for a time, until he can get his own head back.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" remarked the donkey, waving its left ear reflectively.  \"I'm sorry we made such a mistake, and had all our work and worry for  nothing.\"    The other donkeys by this time were sitting up and examining the  strangers with big, glassy eyes.  They made a queer picture, indeed;  for they wore wide, white collars around their necks and the collars  had many scallops and points.  The gentlemen-donkeys wore high pointed  caps set between their great ears, and the lady-donkeys wore sunbonnets  with holes cut in the top for the ears to stick through.  But they had  no other clothing except their hairy skins, although many wore gold and  silver bangles on their front wrists and bands of different metals on  their rear ankles.  When they were kicking they had braced themselves  with their front legs, but now they all stood or sat upright on their  hind legs and used the front ones as arms.  Having no fingers or hands  the beasts were rather clumsy, as you may guess; but Dorothy was  surprised to observe how many things they could do with their stiff,  heavy hoofs.    Some of the donkeys were white, some were brown, or gray, or black, or  spotted; but their hair was sleek and smooth and their broad collars  and caps gave them a neat, if whimsical, appearance.    \"This is a nice way to welcome visitors, I must say!\" remarked the  shaggy man, in a reproachful tone.    \"Oh, we did not mean to be impolite,\" replied a grey donkey which had  not spoken before.  \"But you were not expected, nor did you send in  your visiting cards, as it is proper to do.\"    \"There is some truth in that,\" admitted the shaggy man; \"but, now you  are informed that we are important and distinguished travelers, I trust  you will accord us proper consideration.\"    These big words delighted the donkeys, and made them bow to the shaggy  man with great respect.  Said the grey one:    \"You shall be taken before his great and glorious Majesty King  Kik-a-bray, who will greet you as becomes your exalted stations.\"    \"That's right,\" answered Dorothy.  \"Take us to some one who knows  something.\"    \"Oh, we all know something, my child, or we shouldn't be donkeys,\"  asserted the grey one, with dignity.  \"The word 'donkey' means  'clever,' you know.\"    \"I didn't know it,\" she replied.  \"I thought it meant 'stupid'.\"    \"Not at all, my child.  If you will look in the Encyclopedia Donkaniara  you will find I'm correct.  But come; I will myself lead you before our  splendid, exalted, and most intellectual ruler.\"    All donkeys love big words, so it is no wonder the grey one used so  many of them.          7.  The Shaggy Man's Transformation      They found the houses of the town all low and square and built of  bricks, neatly whitewashed inside and out.  The houses were not set in  rows, forming regular streets, but placed here and there in a haphazard  manner which made it puzzling for a stranger to find his way.    \"Stupid people must have streets and numbered houses in their cities,  to guide them where to go,\" observed the grey donkey, as he walked  before the visitors on his hind legs, in an awkward but comical manner;  \"but clever donkeys know their way about without such absurd marks.  Moreover, a mixed city is much prettier than one with straight streets.\"    Dorothy did not agree with this, but she said nothing to contradict it.  Presently she saw a sign on a house that read: \"Madam de Fayke,  Hoofist,\" and she asked their conductor:    \"What's a 'hoofist,' please?\"    \"One who reads your fortune in your hoofs,\" replied the grey donkey.    \"Oh, I see,\" said the little girl.  \"You are quite civilized here.\"    \"Dunkiton,\" he replied, \"is the center of the world's highest  civilization.\"    They came to a house where two youthful donkeys were whitewashing the  wall, and Dorothy stopped a moment to watch them.  They dipped the ends  of their tails, which were much like paint-brushes, into a pail of  whitewash, backed up against the house, and wagged their tails right  and left until the whitewash was rubbed on the wall, after which they  dipped these funny brushes in the pail again and repeated the  performance.    \"That must be fun,\" said Button-Bright.    \"No, it's work,\" replied the old donkey; \"but we make our youngsters do  all the whitewashing, to keep them out of mischief.\"    \"Don't they go to school?\" asked Dorothy.    \"All donkeys are born wise,\" was the reply, \"so the only school we need  is the school of experience.  Books are only for those who know  nothing, and so are obliged to learn things from other people.\"    \"In other words, the more stupid one is, the more he thinks he knows,\"  observed the shaggy man.  The grey donkey paid no attention to this  speech because he had just stopped before a house which had painted  over the doorway a pair of hoofs, with a donkey tail between them and a  rude crown and sceptre above.    \"I'll see if his magnificent Majesty King Kik-a-bray is at home,\" said  he.  He lifted his head and called \"Whee-haw! whee-haw! whee-haw!\"  three times, in a shocking voice, turning about and kicking with his  heels against the panel of the door.  For a time there was no reply;  then the door opened far enough to permit a donkey's head to stick out  and look at them.    It was a white head, with big, awful ears and round, solemn eyes.    \"Have the foxes gone?\" it asked, in a trembling voice.    \"They haven't been here, most stupendous Majesty,\" replied the grey  one.  \"The new arrivals prove to be travelers of distinction.\"    \"Oh,\" said the King, in a relieved tone of voice.  \"Let them come in.\"    He opened the door wide, and the party marched into a big room, which,  Dorothy thought, looked quite unlike a king's palace.  There were mats  of woven grasses on the floor and the place was clean and neat; but his  Majesty had no other furniture at all--perhaps because he didn't need  it.  He squatted down in the center of the room and a little brown  donkey ran and brought a big gold crown which it placed on the  monarch's head, and a golden staff with a jeweled ball at the end of  it, which the King held between his front hoofs as he sat upright.    \"Now then,\" said his Majesty, waving his long ears gently to and fro,  \"tell me why you are here, and what you expect me to do for you.\"  He  eyed Button-Bright rather sharply, as if afraid of the little boy's  queer head, though it was the shaggy man who undertook to reply.    \"Most noble and supreme ruler of Dunkiton,\" he said, trying not to  laugh in the solemn King's face, \"we are strangers traveling through  your dominions and have entered your magnificent city because the road  led through it, and there was no way to go around.  All we desire is to  pay our respects to your Majesty--the cleverest king in all the world,  I'm sure--and then to continue on our way.\"    This polite speech pleased the King very much; indeed, it pleased him  so much that it proved an unlucky speech for the shaggy man.  Perhaps  the Love Magnet helped to win his Majesty's affections as well as the  flattery, but however this may be, the white donkey looked kindly upon  the speaker and said:    \"Only a donkey should be able to use such fine, big words, and you are  too wise and admirable in all ways to be a mere man.  Also, I feel that  I love you as well as I do my own favored people, so I will bestow upon  you the greatest gift within my power--a donkey's head.\"    As he spoke he waved his jeweled staff.  Although the shaggy man cried  out and tried to leap backward and escape, it proved of no use.  Suddenly his own head was gone and a donkey head appeared in its  place--a brown, shaggy head so absurd and droll that Dorothy and Polly  both broke into merry laughter, and even Button-Bright's fox face wore  a smile.    \"Dear me! dear me!\" cried the shaggy man, feeling of his shaggy new  head and his long ears.  \"What a misfortune--what a great misfortune!  Give me back my own head, you stupid king--if you love me at all!\"    \"Don't you like it?\" asked the King, surprised.    \"Hee-haw!  I hate it!  Take it away, quick!\" said the shaggy man.    \"But I can't do that,\" was the reply.  \"My magic works only one way.  I  can DO things, but I can't UNdo them.  You'll have to find the Truth  Pond, and bathe in its water, in order to get back your own head.  But  I advise you not to do that.  This head is much more beautiful than the  old one.\"    \"That's a matter of taste,\" said Dorothy.    \"Where is the Truth Pond?\" asked the shaggy man, earnestly.    \"Somewhere in the Land of Oz; but just the exact location of it I can  not tell,\" was the answer.    \"Don't worry, Shaggy Man,\" said Dorothy, smiling because her friend  wagged his new ears so comically.  \"If the Truth Pond is in Oz, we'll  be sure to find it when we get there.\"    \"Oh!  Are you going to the Land of Oz?\" asked King Kik-a-bray.    \"I don't know,\" she replied, \"but we've been told we are nearer the  Land of Oz than to Kansas, and if that's so, the quickest way for me to  get home is to find Ozma.\"    \"Haw-haw!  Do you know the mighty Princess Ozma?\" asked the King, his  tone both surprised and eager.    \"'Course I do; she's my friend,\" said Dorothy.    \"Then perhaps you'll do me a favor,\" continued the white donkey, much  excited.    \"What is it?\" she asked.    \"Perhaps you can get me an invitation to Princess Ozma's birthday  celebration, which will be the grandest royal function ever held in  Fairyland.  I'd love to go.\"    \"Hee-haw!  You deserve punishment, rather than reward, for giving me  this dreadful head,\" said the shaggy man, sorrowfully.    \"I wish you wouldn't say 'hee-haw'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#7)"],[1,"do.  Your wheels make you help-less  to in-jure an-y one.  For you have no fists and can not scratch or  e-ven pull hair.  Nor have you an-y feet to kick with.  All you can do  is to yell and shout, and that does not hurt an-y one at all.\"    The Wheeler burst into a flood of tears, to Dorothy's great surprise.    \"Now I and my people are ruined forever!\" he sobbed; \"for you have  discovered our secret.  Being so helpless, our only hope is to make  people afraid of us, by pretending we are very fierce and terrible, and  writing in the sand warnings to Beware the Wheelers.  Until now we have  frightened everyone, but since you have discovered our weakness our  enemies will fall upon us and make us very miserable and unhappy.\"    \"Oh, no,\" exclaimed Dorothy, who was sorry to see this beautifully  dressed Wheeler so miserable; \"Tiktok will keep your secret, and so  will Billina and I.  Only, you must promise not to try to frighten  children any more, if they come near to you.\"    \"I won't--indeed I won't!\" promised the Wheeler, ceasing to cry and  becoming more cheerful.  \"I'm not really bad, you know; but we have to  pretend to be terrible in order to prevent others from attacking us.\"    \"That is not ex-act-ly true,\" said Tiktok, starting to walk toward the  path through the forest, and still holding fast to his prisoner, who  rolled slowly along beside him.  \"You and your peo-ple are full of  mis-chief, and like to both-er those who fear you.  And you are of-ten  im-pu-dent and dis-a-gree-a-ble, too.  But if you will try to cure  those faults I will not tell any-one how help-less you are.\"    \"I'll try, of course,\" replied the Wheeler, eagerly.  \"And thank you,  Mr. Tiktok, for your kindness.\"    \"I am on-ly a ma-chine,\" said Tiktok.  \"I can not be kind an-y more  than I can be sor-ry or glad.  I can on-ly do what I am wound up to do.\"    \"Are you wound up to keep my secret?\" asked the Wheeler, anxiously.    \"Yes; if you be-have your-self.  But tell me: who rules the Land of Ev  now?\" asked the machine.    \"There is no ruler,\" was the answer, \"because every member of the royal  family is imprisoned by the Nome King.  But the Princess Langwidere,  who is a niece of our late King Evoldo, lives in a part of the royal  palace and takes as much money out of the royal treasury as she can  spend.  The Princess Langwidere is not exactly a ruler, you see,  because she doesn't rule; but she is the nearest approach to a ruler we  have at present.\"    \"I do not re-mem-ber her,\" said Tiktok.  \"What does she look like?\"    \"That I cannot say,\" replied the Wheeler, \"although I have seen her  twenty times.  For the Princess Langwidere is a different person every  time I see her, and the only way her subjects can recognize her at all  is by means of a beautiful ruby key which she always wears on a chain  attached to her left wrist.  When we see the key we know we are  beholding the Princess.\"    \"That is strange,\" said Dorothy, in astonishment.  \"Do you mean to say  that so many different princesses are one and the same person?\"    \"Not exactly,\" answered the Wheeler.  \"There is, of course, but one  princess; but she appears to us in many forms, which are all more or  less beautiful.\"    \"She must be a witch,\" exclaimed the girl.    \"I do not think so,\" declared the Wheeler.  \"But there is some mystery  connected with her, nevertheless.  She is a very vain creature, and  lives mostly in a room surrounded by mirrors, so that she can admire  herself whichever way she looks.\"    No one answered this speech, because they had just passed out of the  forest and their attention was fixed upon the scene before them--a  beautiful vale in which were many fruit trees and green fields, with  pretty farm-houses scattered here and there and broad, smooth roads  that led in every direction.    In the center of this lovely vale, about a mile from where our friends  were standing, rose the tall spires of the royal palace, which  glittered brightly against their background of blue sky.  The palace  was surrounded by charming grounds, full of flowers and shrubbery.  Several tinkling fountains could be seen, and there were pleasant walks  bordered by rows of white marble statuary.    All these details Dorothy was, of course, unable to notice or admire  until they had advanced along the road to a position quite near to the  palace, and she was still looking at the pretty sights when her little  party entered the grounds and approached the big front door of the  king's own apartments.  To their disappointment they found the door  tightly closed.  A sign was tacked to the panel which read as follows:      +----------------------------+    |                            |    |       OWNER ABSENT.        |    |                            |    | Please Knock at the Third  |    | Door in the Left Wing.     |    |                            |    +----------------------------+      \"Now,\" said Tiktok to the captive Wheeler, \"you must show us the way to  the Left Wing.\"    \"Very well,\" agreed the prisoner, \"it is around here at the right.\"    \"How can the left wing be at the right?\" demanded Dorothy, who feared  the Wheeler was fooling them.    \"Because there used to be three wings, and two were torn down, so the  one on the right is the only one left.  It is a trick of the Princess  Langwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her.\"    Then the captive led them around to the wing, after which the machine  man, having no further use for the Wheeler, permitted him to depart and  rejoin his fellows.  He immediately rolled away at a great pace and was  soon lost to sight.    Tiktok now counted the doors in the wing and knocked loudly upon the  third one.    It was opened by a little maid in a cap trimmed with gay ribbons, who  bowed respectfully and asked:    \"What do you wish, good people?\"    \"Are you the Princess Langwidere?\" asked Dorothy.    \"No, miss; I am her servant,\" replied the maid.    \"May I see the Princess, please?\"    \"I will tell her you are here, miss, and ask her to grant you an  audience,\" said the maid.  \"Step in, please, and take a seat in the  drawing-room.\"    So Dorothy walked in, followed closely by the machine.  But as the  yellow hen tried to enter after them, the little maid cried \"Shoo!\" and  flapped her apron in Billina's face.    \"Shoo, yourself!\" retorted the hen, drawing back in anger and ruffling  up her feathers.  \"Haven't you any better manners than that?\"    \"Oh, do you talk?\" enquired the maid, evidently surprised.    \"Can't you hear me?\" snapped Billina.  \"Drop that apron, and get out of  the doorway, so that I may enter with my friends!\"    \"The Princess won't like it,\" said the maid, hesitating.    \"I don't care whether she likes it or not,\" replied Billina, and  fluttering her wings with a loud noise she flew straight at the maid's  face.  The little servant at once ducked her head, and the hen reached  Dorothy's side in safety.    \"Very well,\" sighed the maid; \"if you are all ruined because of this  obstinate hen, don't blame me for it.  It isn't safe to annoy the  Princess Langwidere.\"    \"Tell her we are waiting, if you please,\" Dorothy requested, with  dignity.  \"Billina is my friend, and must go wherever I go.\"    Without more words the maid led them to a richly furnished  drawing-room, lighted with subdued rainbow tints that came in through  beautiful stained-glass windows.    \"Remain here,\" she said.  \"What names shall I give the Princess?\"    \"I am Dorothy Gale, of Kansas,\" replied the child; \"and this gentleman  is a machine named Tiktok, and the yellow hen is my friend Billina.\"    The little servant bowed and withdrew, going through several passages  and mounting two marble stairways before she came to the apartments  occupied by her mistress.    Princess Langwidere's sitting-room was paneled with great mirrors,  which reached from the ceiling to the floor; also the ceiling was  composed of mirrors, and the floor was of polished silver that  reflected every object upon it.  So when Langwidere sat in her easy  chair and played soft melodies upon her mandolin, her form was mirrored  hundreds of times, in walls and ceiling and floor, and whichever way  the lady turned her head she could see and admire her own features.  This she loved to do, and just as the maid entered she was saying to  herself:    \"This head with the auburn hair and hazel eyes is quite attractive.  I  must wear it more often than I have done of late, although it may not  be the best of my collection.\"    \"You have company, Your Highness,\" announced the maid, bowing low.    \"Who is it?\" asked Langwidere, yawning.    \"Dorothy Gale of Kansas, Mr. Tiktok and Billina,\" answered the maid.    \"What a queer lot of names!\" murmured the Princess, beginning to be a  little interested.  \"What are they like?  Is Dorothy Gale of Kansas  pretty?\"    \"She might be called so,\" the maid replied.    \"And is Mr. Tiktok attractive?\" continued the Princess.    \"That I cannot say, Your Highness.  But he seems very bright.  Will  Your Gracious Highness see them?\"    \"Oh, I may as well, Nanda.  But I am tired admiring this head, and if  my visitor has any claim to beauty I must take care that she does not  surpass me.  So I will go to my cabinet and change to No. 17, which I  think is my best appearance.  Don't you?\"    \"Your No. 17 is exceedingly beautiful,\" answered Nanda, with another  bow.    Again the Princess yawned.  Then she said:    \"Help me to rise.\"    So the maid assisted her to gain her feet, although Langwidere was the  stronger of the two; and then the Princess slowly walked across the  silver floor to her cabinet, leaning heavily at every step upon Nanda's  arm.    Now I must explain to you that the Princess Langwidere had thirty  heads--as many as there are days in the month.  But of course she could  only wear one of them at a time, because she had but one neck.  These  heads were kept in what she called her \"cabinet,\" which was a beautiful"]]]
