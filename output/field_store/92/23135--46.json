He could not offer them fish,  but he had something else in his  larder.    Sir Isaac Newton wore his black  and gold waistcoat.      And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy  Tortoise brought a salad with him in a  string bag.    And instead of a nice dish of  minnows, they had a roasted  grasshopper with lady-bird sauce,  which frogs consider a beautiful treat;  but _I_ think it must have been nasty!        THE STORY OF  A FIERCE BAD RABBIT          This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at  his savage whiskers and his claws and  his turned-up tail.    This is a nice gentle Rabbit. His  mother has given him a carrot.    The bad Rabbit would like some  carrot.      He doesn't say \"Please.\" He takes it!    And he scratches the good Rabbit  very badly.    The good Rabbit creeps away and  hides in a hole. It feels sad.      This is a man with a gun.    He sees something sitting on a  bench. He thinks it is a very funny  bird!    He comes creeping up behind the  trees.      And then he shoots--BANG!    This is what happens--    But this is all he finds on the bench  when he rushes up with his gun.      The good Rabbit peeps out of its  hole . . .    . . . and it sees the bad Rabbit  tearing past--without any tail or  whiskers!        THE STORY OF  MISS MOPPET        This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet;  she thinks she has heard a mouse!    This is the Mouse peeping out  behind the cupboard and making  fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid  of a kitten.    This is Miss Moppet jumping just  too late; she misses the Mouse and  hits her own head.      She thinks it is a very hard  cupboard!    The Mouse watches Miss Moppet  from the top of the cupboard.    Miss Moppet ties up her head in a  duster and sits before the fire.      The Mouse thinks she is looking  very ill. He comes sliding down the  bellpull.    Miss Moppet looks worse and  worse. The Mouse comes a little  nearer.    Miss Moppet holds her poor head in  her paws and looks at him through a  hole in the duster. The Mouse comes  VERY close.      And then all of a sudden--Miss  Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!    And because the Mouse has teased  Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she  will tease the Mouse, which is not at  all nice of Miss Moppet.    She ties him up in the duster and  tosses it about like a ball.      But she forgot about that hole in  the duster; and when she untied it--  there was no Mouse!    He has wriggled out and run away;  and he is dancing a jig on top of the  cupboard!        THE TALE OF  TOM KITTEN    [Dedicated to All Pickles,  --Especially to Those That Get upon My Garden Wall]          Once upon a time there were three  little kittens, and their names were  Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.    They had dear little fur coats of  their own; and they tumbled about  the doorstep and played in the dust.    But one day their mother--Mrs.  Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to  tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors,  to wash and dress them, before the  fine company arrived.    First she scrubbed their faces (this  one is Moppet).      Then she brushed their fur (this  one is Mittens).    Then she combed their tails and  whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).    Tom was very naughty, and he  scratched.    Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and  Mittens in clean pinafores and  tuckers; and then she took all sorts of  elegant uncomfortable clothes out of  a chest of drawers, in order to dress  up her son Thomas.      Tom Kitten was very fat, and he  had grown; several buttons burst off.  His mother sewed them on again.    When the three kittens were ready,  Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them  out into the garden, to be out of the  way while she made hot buttered  toast.    \"Now keep your frocks clean,  children! You must walk on your hind  legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-  pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and  from the pigsty and the Puddle-  ducks.\"    Moppet and Mittens walked down  the garden path unsteadily. Presently  they trod upon their pinafores and fell  on their noses.    When they stood up there were  several green smears!      \"Let us climb up the rockery and sit  on the garden wall,\" said Moppet.    They turned their pinafores back to  front and went up with a skip and a  jump; Moppet's white tucker fell  down into the road.    Tom Kitten was quite unable to  jump when walking upon his hind  legs in trousers. He came up the  rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns  and shedding buttons right and left.    He was all in pieces when he  reached the top of the wall.    Moppet and Mittens tried to pull  him together; his hat fell off, and the  rest of his buttons burst.      While they were in difficulties, there  was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the  three Puddle-ducks came along the  hard high road, marching one behind  the other and doing the goose step--  pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle  pat!    They stopped and stood in a row  and stared up at the kittens. They had  very small eyes and looked surprised.  Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah  and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up  the hat and tucker and put them on.      Mittens laughed so that she fell off  the wall. Moppet and Tom descended  after her; the pinafores and all the  rest of Tom's clothes came off on the  way down.    \"Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-duck,\"  said Moppet. \"Come and help us to  dress him! Come and button up  Tom!\"    Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced  in a slow sideways manner and  picked up the various articles.    But he put them on HIMSELF! They  fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.    \"It's a very fine morning!\" said Mr.  Drake Puddle-duck.      And he and Jemima and Rebeccah  Puddle-duck set off up the road,  keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit  pat, waddle pat!    Then Tabitha Twitchit came down  the garden and found her kittens on  the wall with no clothes on.    She pulled them off the wall,  smacked them, and took them back  to the house.    \"My friends will arrive in a minute,  and you are not fit to be seen; I am  affronted,\" said Mrs. Tabitha  Twitchit.      She sent them upstairs; and I am  sorry to say she told her friends that  they were in bed with the measles--  which was not true.    Quite the contrary; they were not in bed:  NOT in the least.    Somehow there were very extra--  ordinary noises overhead, which  disturbed the dignity and repose of  the tea party.    And I think that some day I shall  have to make another, larger book, to  tell you more about Tom Kitten!      As for the Puddle-ducks--they  went into a pond.    The clothes all came off directly,  because there were no buttons.    And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and  Jemima and Rebeccah, have been  looking for them ever since.        THE TALE OF  JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK    [A Farmyard Tale for  Ralph and Betsy]        What a funny sight it is to see a  brood of ducklings with a hen!    Listen to the story of Jemima  Puddle-duck, who was annoyed  because the farmer's wife would not  let her hatch her own eggs.    Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah  Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to  leave the hatching to someone else--  \"I have not the patience to sit on a  nest for twenty-eight days; and no  more have you, Jemima. You would  let them go cold; you know you  would!\"    \"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will  hatch them all by myself,\" quacked  Jemima Puddle-duck.    She tried to hide her eggs; but they  were always found and carried off.    Jemima Puddle-duck became quite  desperate. She determined to make a  nest right away from the farm.      She set off on a fine spring  afternoon along the cart road that  leads over the hill.    She was wearing a shawl and a  poke bonnet.    When she reached the top of the  hill, she saw a wood in the distance.    She thought that it looked a safe  quiet spot.    Jemima Puddle-duck was not much  in the habit of flying. She ran downhill  a few yards flapping her shawl, and  then she jumped off into the air.      She flew beautifully when she had  got a good start.    She skimmed along over the  treetops until she saw an open place  in the middle of the wood, where the  trees and brushwood had been  cleared.    Jemima alighted rather heavily and  began to waddle about in search of a  convenient dry nesting place. She  rather fancied a tree stump amongst  some tall foxgloves.    But--seated upon the stump, she  was startled to find an elegantly  dressed gentleman reading a  newspaper. He had black prick ears  and sandy colored whiskers.    \"Quack?\" said Jemima Puddle-  duck, with her head and her bonnet  on the one side--\"Quack?\"    The gentleman raised his eyes  above his newspaper and looked  curiously at Jemima--    \"Madam, have you lost your way?\"  said he. He had a long bushy tail  which he was sitting upon, as the  stump was somewhat damp.    Jemima thought him mighty civil  and handsome. She explained that she  had not lost her way, but that she was  trying to find a convenient dry nesting  place.      \"Ah! is that so? Indeed!\" said the  gentleman with sandy whiskers,  looking curiously at Jemima. He  folded up the newspaper and put it in  his coattail pocket.    Jemima complained of the  superfluous hen.    \"Indeed! How interesting! I wish I  could meet with that fowl. I would  teach it to mind its own business!    \"But as to a nest--there is no  difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers  in my woodshed. No, my dear  madam, you will be in nobody's way.  You may sit there as long as you like,\"  said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    He led the way to a very retired,  dismal-looking house amongst the  foxgloves.    It was built of faggots and turf, and  there were two broken pails, one on  top of another, by way of a chimney.    \"This is my summer residence; you  would not find my earth--my winter  house--so convenient,\" said the  hospitable gentleman.    There was a tumbledown shed at  the back of the house, made of old  soap boxes. The gentleman opened  the door and showed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#7)"],[1," George Melville with an  insinuating smile.    \"You have certainly taken considerable trouble to arrange this matter  for me,\" said Melville, with a sarcasm which Eben did not detect.    \"Oh, no trouble at all!\" said Eben, cheerfully. \"You see, the idea came  into my head when Herbert told me of his arrangements with you, and I  thought I'd come and see you about it.\"    \"Did you mention it to Herbert?\" asked George Melville, with some  curiosity.    \"Well, no, I didn't. I didn't know how Herbert would look at it. I got  Herbert to take my place in the store while I ran over to see you about  the matter. By the way, though I am some years older than Herbert, I  shan't ask more than you pay him. In fact, I am willing to leave the pay  to your liberality.\"    \"You are very considerate!\" said Melville, hardly knowing whether to be  amused or provoked by the cool assurance of his visitor.    \"Oh, not at all!\" returned Eben, complacently. \"I guess I've fetched  him!\" he reflected, looking at Mr. Melville through his small,  half-closed eyes.    \"You have certainly surprised me very much, Mr. Graham,\" said Melville,  \"by the nature of your suggestion. I won't take into consideration the  question whether you have thought more of your own pleasure or mine.  So far as the latter is concerned, you have made a mistake in supposing  that Herbert's youth is any drawback to his qualification as a  companion. Indeed, his youth and cheerful temperament make him more  attractive in my eyes. I hope, Mr. Graham, you will excuse me for saying  that he suits me better than you possibly could.\"    Eben's countenance fell, and he looked quite discomfited and mortified.    \"I didn't suppose a raw, country boy would be likely to suit a gentleman  of taste, who has resided in the city,\" he said, with asperity.    \"Then you will have a chance to correct your impression,\" said Melville,  with a slight smile.    \"Then you don't care to accept my offer?\" said Eben, regretfully.    \"Thank you, no. If you will excuse me for suggesting it, Mr. Graham,  it would have been more considerate for you to have apprised Herbert of  your object in asking him to take your place this evening. Probably he  had no idea that you meant to supersede him with me.\"    Eben tossed his head.    \"You mustn't think, Mr. Melville,\" he said, \"that I was after the extra  pay. Six dollars doesn't seem much to me. I was earning ten dollars a  week in Boston, and if I had stayed, should probably have been raised to  twelve.\"    \"So that you were really consenting to a sacrifice in offering to enter  my employment at six dollars a week?\"    \"Just so!\"    \"Then I am all the more convinced that I have decided for the best in  retaining Herbert. I do not wish to interfere with your prospects in the  city.\"    \"Oh, as for that,\" said Eben, judging that he had gone too far, \"I  don't care to go back to the city just yet. I've been confined pretty  steadily, and a few weeks in the country, hunting and fishing, will do  me good.\"    George Melville bowed, but said nothing.    Eben felt that he had no excuse for staying longer, and reluctantly  rose.    \"If you should think better of what I've proposed,\" he said, \"you can  let me know.\"    \"I will do so,\" said Melville.    \"He's rather a queer young man,\" muttered Eben, as he descended the  stairs. \"It's funny that he should prefer a country boy like Herbert to  a young man like me who's seen life, and got some city polish--at the  same price, too! He don't seem to see his own interest. I'm sorry, for  it would have been a good deal more interesting to me, going round with  him a few hours a day, than tending store for father. There's one thing  sure, I won't do it long. I'm fitted for a higher position than that, I  hope.\"    \"For downright impudence and cool assurance, I think that young man will  bear off the palm,\" thought George Melville, as his unwelcome visitor  left the room. \"Herbert is in no danger from him. It would probably  surprise him if he knew that I should consider his company as an  intolerable bore. I will tell Herbert to-morrow the good turn his friend  has tried to do him.\"          CHAPTER IX. THE SOLITARY FARMHOUSE.        If Eben had been sensitive, the cool reception which he met with at the  hands of Mr. Melville would have disturbed him. As it was, he felt  angry and disappointed, and desirous of \"coming up with\" Herbert, as he  expressed it, though it was hard to see in what way the boy had injured  him. It did not seem quite clear at present how he was to punish  Herbert, but he only waited for an occasion.    When Herbert learned, the next morning, from Mr. Melville, in what  manner Eben had tried to undermine him, and deprive him of his  situation, he was naturally indignant.    \"I didn't think Eben Graham could be so mean,\" he exclaimed.    \"It was certainly a mean thing to do, Herbert,\" said George Melville;  \"but you can afford to treat young Graham with contempt, as he has been  unable to do you any injury.\"    \"What shall we do this morning, Mr. Melville?\" asked Herbert.    \"I should like a row on the river,\" said Melville. \"Do you know of any  boat we can have?\"    \"Walter Ingalls has a boat; I think we can hire that.\"    \"Do you know him?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then you may go and ascertain whether we can have it, or I will go with  you to avoid loss of time.\"    The boat was readily loaned, and the two were soon on the river. Mr.  Melville first took the oars, but he was quickly fatigued, and resigned  them to Herbert, who was strong and muscular for his age. As his  companion observed his strong and steady strokes, he said:    \"Herbert, I am disposed to envy you your strength and endurance. I get  tired very easily.\"    \"Were you not strong when a boy?\" asked Herbert.    \"I never had much endurance. My mother had a feeble constitution and was  consumptive, and I inherit something of her weakness.\"    \"It is fortunate that you have money, Mr. Melville, so that you are not  obliged to work.\"    \"True; but I would give half my fortune to be strong and well.\"    Herbert noticed the hectic flush upon Mr. Melville's cheeks, and his  white, transparent hands, and his sympathy was aroused.    \"I see,\" he said, thoughtfully, \"that I am more fortunate than I thought  in my health and strength.\"    \"They are blessings not to be overestimated, Herbert. However, my lot  is, on the whole, a happy one, even though my life will probably be  brief, and I have still many sources of satisfaction and enjoyment.\"    The river led away from the village, flowing between wooded banks, with  here and there a cottage set in the midst of the fields. Lying back in  the stern, Melville enjoyed their tranquil passage, when their attention  was suddenly attracted by a boy who stood on the bank, frantically  waving his hat. Melville was the first to see him.    \"What can that boy want?\" he asked.    Herbert immediately looked around, and exclaimed in surprise:    \"It's Tom Tripp!\"    \"Row to shore, and see what he wants,\" said Melville, quickly.    They were already near, and in a brief space of time they touched the  bank.    \"What's the matter, Tom?\"    \"There's a tramp in the house, stealing all he can lay hands on,\"  answered Tom, in excitement.    \"What house?\"    \"Farmer Cole's.\"    Mr. Cole was the farmer for whom Tom Tripp was working.    Tom explained that the farmer was gone to the village, leaving his wife  alone. A tramp had come to the door and asked for a meal. While Mrs.  Cole was getting something for him, the visitor looked about him and,  finding that there was no man about, boldly demanded money, after  unceremoniously possessing himself of the silver spoons.    \"Is he armed?\" asked Melville.    \"I don't know; I don't think so.\"    \"Does he know that you have gone for help?\"    \"No; he did not see me. I came from the fields, and saw him through the  window. Mrs. Cole thinks I am in the field and there is no help near.\"    Physical courage and physical strength do not always go together, and  a weak man often excels a strong man in bravery. George Melville was  thoroughly roused. For injustice or brutality he had a hearty contempt,  and he was not one to stand by and see a ruffian triumph.    \"Come, Herbert,\" he said; \"let us go to the help of this poor woman.\"    \"With all my heart,\" answered Herbert, his eyes flashing.    Before describing the appearance of Herbert and George Melville upon  the scene, I will go back a few minutes and relate what happened at the  farmhouse.    Mrs. Cole was engaged in ironing when she heard a knock at the door.    Answering the summons, she found herself confronted by an ill-looking  fellow whose dusty and travel-soiled garments revealed the character of  the wearer.    \"What is it you wish?\" asked the farmer's wife.    \"I'm hungry!\" said the tramp. \"Can you give me something to eat?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Cole, cheerfully, for the good woman could not find  it in her heart to turn away a fellow creature suffering from hunger.  \"We have enough and to spare. Come in, and sit down at the table.\"    The visitor followed her into the kitchen and took a seat at the table,  while the farmer's wife went to the pantry and brought out half a loaf  of bread and a plate of cold meat.    The tramp was not long in attacking it, but after a few mouthfuls laid  down his knife and fork.    \"Where's the coffee?\" he asked.    \"I have no warm coffee,\" she answered.    \"Don't you drink coffee in the morning?\"    \"Yes, but breakfast was over two or three hours since. Shall I get you a  glass of water?\"    \"Haven't you any cider?\"    \"It seems to me you are particular,\" said Mrs. Cole, growing indignant.    \"All the same I want some cider,\" said the tramp, impudently.    \"I have no cider,\" answered Mrs. Cole, shortly.    \"A pretty farmhouse this is, without cider,\" growled the tramp. \"You can  make me some coffee, then!\"    \"Who are you to order me round in my own house?\" demanded Mrs."]]]
