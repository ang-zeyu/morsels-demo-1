When Jefferson succeeded in negotiating the cession of that vast and  rich domain to the United States, it is not to be supposed that either  the allurements of territorial aggrandizement on the one hand, or the  impending danger to the continued ascendency of the political party  which had elevated him to the Presidency, threatening it from all the  irritations with republican France likely to grow out of such near  proximity to her Colony, on the other, could have blinded his eyes to  the fact that its acquisition must inevitably tend to the spread of that  very evil, the contemplation of which, at a later day, wrung from his  lips the prophetic words, \"I tremble for my Country when I reflect that  God is just.\"  It is more reasonable to suppose that, as he believed the  ascendency of the Republican party of that day essential to the  perpetuity of the Republic itself, and revolted against being driven  into an armed alliance with Monarchical England against what he termed  \"our natural friend,\" Republican France, he reached the conclusion that  the preservation of his Republican principles was of more immediate  moment than the question of the perpetuation and increase of human  Slavery.  Be that as it may, it none the less remains a curious fact  that it was to Jefferson, the far-seeing statesman and hater of African  Slavery and the author of the Ordinance of 1784--which sought to exclude  Slavery from all the Territories of the United States south of, as well  as north-west of the Ohio River--that we also owe the acquisition of the  vast territory of the Mississippi Valley burdened with Slavery in such  shape that only a War, which nearly wrecked our Republic, could get rid  of!    Out of that vast and fertile, but Slave-ridden old French Colony of  \"Louisiana\" were developed in due time the rich and flourishing Slave  States of Louisiana, Missouri and Arkansas.    It will have been observed that this acquisition of the Colony of  Louisiana and the contemporaneous inventions of the cotton-gin, improved  cotton-spinning machinery, and the application to it of steam power, had  already completely neutralized the wisdom of the Fathers in securing, as  they thought, the gradual but certain extinction of Slavery in the  United States, by that provision in the Constitution which enabled  Congress, after an interval of twenty years, to prohibit the African  Slave Trade; and which led the Congress, on March 22, 1794, to pass an  Act prohibiting it; to supplement it in 1800 with another Act in the  same direction; and on March 2, 1807, to pass another supplemental Act  --to take effect January 1, 1808--still more stringent, and covering any  such illicit traffic, whether to the United States or with other  countries.  Never was the adage that, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an'  men gang aft agley,\" more painfully apparent.  Slaves increased and  multiplied within the land, and enriched their white owners to such a  degree that, as the years rolled by, instead of compunctions of  conscience on the subject of African Slavery in America, the Southern  leaders ultimately persuaded themselves to the belief that it was not  only moral, and sanctioned by Divine Law, but that to perpetuate it was  a philanthropic duty, beneficial to both races!  In fact one of them  declared it to be \"the highest type of civilization.\"    In 1812, the State of Louisiana, organized from the purchased Colony of  the same name, was admitted to the Union, and the balance of the  Louisiana purchase was thereafter known as the Territory of Missouri.    In 1818 commenced the heated and protracted struggle in Congress over  the admission of the State of Missouri--created from the Territory of  that name--as a Slave State, which finally culminated in 1820 in the  settlement known thereafter as the \"Missouri Compromise.\"    Briefly stated, that struggle may be said to have consisted in the  efforts of the House on the one side, to restrict Slavery in the State  of Missouri, and the efforts of the Senate on the other, to give it free  rein.  The House insisted on a clause in the Act of admission providing,  \"That the introduction of Slavery or involuntary servitude be  prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes whereof the party has  been duly convicted; and that all children born within the said State,  after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be declared Free at  the age of twenty-five years.\"  The Senate resisted it--and the Bill  fell.  In the meantime, however, a Bill passed both Houses forming the  Territory of Arkansas out of that portion of the Territory of Missouri  not included in the proposed State of Missouri, without any such  restriction upon Slavery.  Subsequently, the House having passed a Bill  to admit the State of Maine to the Union, the Senate amended it by  tacking on a provision authorizing the people of Missouri to organize a  State Government, without restriction as to Slavery.  The House  decidedly refused to accede to the Senate proposition, and the result of  the disagreement was a Committee of Conference between the two Houses,  and the celebrated \"Missouri Compromise,\" which, in the language of  another--[Hon.  John Holmes of Massachusetts, of said Committee on  Conference, March 2, 1820.]--, was: \"that the Senate should give up its  combination of Missouri with Maine; that the House should abandon its  attempt to restrict Slavery in Missouri; and that both Houses should  concur in passing the Bill to admit Missouri as a State, with\" a  \"restriction or proviso, excluding Slavery from all territory north and  west of the new State\"--that \"restriction or proviso\" being in these  words: \"That in all that territory ceded by France to the United States  under the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six degrees,  thirty minutes north latitude, excepting only such part thereof as is  included within the limits of the State contemplated by this act,  Slavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of  crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall be and is  hereby forever prohibited; Provided always, that any person escaping  into the same, from whom labor and service is lawfully claimed in any  State or Territory of the United States, such Fugitive may be lawfully  reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or  service, as aforesaid.\"  At a subsequent session of Congress, at which  Missouri asked admission as a State with a Constitution prohibiting her  Legislature from passing emancipation laws, or such as would prevent the  immigration of Slaves, while requiring it to enact such as would  absolutely prevent the immigration of Free Negroes or Mulattoes, a  further Compromise was agreed to by Congress under the inspiration of  Mr. Clay, by which it was laid down as a condition precedent to her  admission as a State--a condition subsequently complied with--that  Missouri must pledge herself that her Legislature should pass no act \"by  which any of the citizens of either of the States should be excluded  from the enjoyment of the privileges and immunities to which they are  entitled under the Constitution of the United States.\"    This, in a nut-shell, was the memorable Missouri Struggle, and the  \"Compromise\" or Compromises which settled and ended it.  But during that  struggle--as during the formation of the Federal Constitution and at  various times in the interval when exciting questions had arisen--the  bands of National Union were more than once rudely strained, and this  time to such a degree as even to shake the faith of some of the firmest  believers in the perpetuity of that Union.  It was during this bitter  struggle that John Adams wrote to Jefferson: \"I am sometimes Cassandra  enough to dream that another Hamilton, another Burr, may rend this  mighty fabric in twain, or perhaps into a leash, and a few more choice  spirits of the same stamp might produce as many Nations in North America  as there are in Europe.\"    It is true that we had \"sown the wind,\" but we had not yet \"reaped the  whirlwind.\"                                        CHAPTER II.                           PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE.    We have seen that the first Federal Congress met at New York in March,  1789.  It organized April 6th.  None knew better than its members that  the war of the Americana Revolution chiefly grew out of the efforts of  Great Britain to cripple and destroy our Colonial industries to the  benefit of the British trader, and that the Independence conquered, was  an Industrial as well as Political Independence; and none knew better  than they, that the failure of the subsequent political Confederation of  States was due mainly to its failure to encourage and protect the  budding domestic manufactures of those States.  Hence they hastened,  under the leadership of James Madison, to pass \"An Act laying a duty on  goods, wares and merchandize imported into the United States,\" with a  preamble, declaring it to be \"necessary\" for the \"discharge of the debt  of the United States and the encouragement and protection of  manufactures.\"  It was approved by President Washington July 4, 1789--a  date not without its significance--and levied imports both specific and  ad valorem.  It was not only our first Tariff Act, but, next to that  prescribing the oath used in organizing the Government, the first Act of  the first Federal Congress; and was passed in pursuance of the  declaration of President Washington in his first Message, that \"The  safety and interest of the People\" required it.  Under the inspiration  of Alexander Hamilton the Tariff of 1790 was enacted at the second  session of the same Congress, confirming the previous Act and increasing  some of the protective duties thereby imposed.    An analysis of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#7)"],[1,"they found there, which has remained there ever since. I  don't know where the \"ford\" comes in--there's nothing to ford, except in  flood-time. Hungerthirst would have been better. The town is supposed  to be situated on the banks of a river called the Paroo, but we saw no  water there, except what passed for it in a tank. The goats and sheep  and dogs and the rest of the population drink there. It is dangerous to  take too much of that water in a raw state.    Except in flood-time you couldn't find the bed of the river without the  aid of a spirit-level and a long straight-edge. There is a Custom-house  against the fence on the northern side. A pound of tea often costs  six shillings on that side, and you can get a common lead pencil for  fourpence at the rival store across the street in the mother province.  Also, a small loaf of sour bread sells for a shilling at the humpy  aforementioned. Only about sixty per cent of the sugar will melt.    We saw one of the storekeepers give a dead-beat swagman five shillings'  worth of rations to take him on into Queensland. The storekeepers often  do this, and put it down on the loss side of their books. I hope the  recording angel listens, and puts it down on the right side of his book.    We camped on the Queensland side of the fence, and after tea had a yarn  with an old man who was minding a mixed flock of goats and sheep; and we  asked him whether he thought Queensland was better than New South Wales,  or the other way about.    He scratched the back of his head, and thought a while, and hesitated  like a stranger who is going to do you a favour at some personal  inconvenience.    At last, with the bored air of a man who has gone through the same  performance too often before, he stepped deliberately up to the fence  and spat over it into New South Wales. After which he got leisurely  through and spat back on Queensland.    \"That's what I think of the blanky colonies!\" he said.    He gave us time to become sufficiently impressed; then he said:    \"And if I was at the Victorian and South Australian border I'd do the  same thing.\"    He let that soak into our minds, and added: \"And the same with West  Australia--and--and Tasmania.\" Then he went away.    The last would have been a long spit--and he forgot Maoriland.    We heard afterwards that his name was Clancy and he had that day been  offered a job droving at \"twenty-five shillings a week and find your  own horse.\" Also find your own horse feed and tobacco and soap and other  luxuries, at station prices. Moreover, if you lost your own horse you  would have to find another, and if that died or went astray you would  have to find a third--or forfeit your pay and return on foot. The  boss drover agreed to provide flour and mutton--when such things were  procurable.    Consequently, Clancy's unfavourable opinion of the colonies.    My mate and I sat down on our swags against the fence to talk things  over. One of us was very deaf. Presently a black tracker went past and  looked at us, and returned to the pub. Then a trooper in Queensland  uniform came along and asked us what the trouble was about, and where  we came from and were going, and where we camped. We said we were  discussing private business, and he explained that he thought it was  a row, and came over to see. Then he left us, and later on we saw him  sitting with the rest of the population on a bench under the hotel  veranda. Next morning we rolled up our swags and left Hungerford to the  north-west.          A CAMP-FIRE YARN      \"This girl,\" said Mitchell, continuing a yarn to his mate, \"was about  the ugliest girl I ever saw, except one, and I'll tell you about her  directly. The old man had a carpenter's shop fixed up in a shed at the  back of his house, and he used to work there pretty often, and sometimes  I'd come over and yarn with him. One day I was sitting on the end of  the bench, and the old man was working away, and Mary was standing there  too, all three of us yarning--she mostly came poking round where I was  if I happened to be on the premises--or at least I thought so--and  we got yarning about getting married, and the old cove said he'd get  married again if the old woman died.    \"'_You_ get married again!' said Mary. 'Why, father, you wouldn't get  anyone to marry you--who'd have you?'    \"'Well,' he said, 'I bet I'll get someone sooner than you, anyway.  You don't seem to be able to get anyone, and it's pretty near time you  thought of settlin' down and gettin' married. I wish _someone_ would  have you.'    \"He hit her pretty hard there, but it served her right. She got as good  as she gave. She looked at me and went all colours, and then she went  back to her washtub.    \"She was mighty quiet at tea-time--she seemed hurt a lot, and I began to  feel sorry I'd laughed at the old man's joke, for she was really a good,  hard-working girl, and you couldn't help liking her.    \"So after tea I went out to her in the kitchen, where she was washing  up, to try and cheer her up a bit. She'd scarcely speak at first, except  to say 'Yes' or 'No', and kept her face turned away from me; and I could  see that she'd been crying. I began to feel sorry for her and mad at the  old man, and I started to comfort her. But I didn't go the right way to  work about it. I told her that she mustn't take any notice of the old  cove, as he didn't mean half he said. But she seemed to take it harder  than ever, and at last I got so sorry for her that I told her that _I'd_  have her if she'd have me.\"    \"And what did she say?\" asked Mitchell's mate, after a pause.    \"She said she wouldn't have me at any price!\"    The mate laughed, and Mitchell grinned his quiet grin.    \"Well, this set me thinking,\" he continued. \"I always knew I was a  dashed ugly cove, and I began to wonder whether any girl would really  have me; and I kept on it till at last I made up my mind to find out and  settle the matter for good--or bad.    \"There was another farmer's daughter living close by, and I met her  pretty often coming home from work, and sometimes I had a yarn with her.  She was plain, and no mistake: Mary was a Venus alongside of her. She  had feet like a Lascar, and hands about ten sizes too large for her,  and a face like that camel--only red; she walked like a camel, too. She  looked like a ladder with a dress on, and she didn't know a great A from  a corner cupboard.    \"Well, one evening I met her at the sliprails, and presently I asked  her, for a joke, if she'd marry me. Mind you, I never wanted to marry  _her_; I was only curious to know whether any girl would have me.    \"She turned away her face and seemed to hesitate, and I was just turning  away and beginning to think I was a dashed hopeless case, when all of a  sudden she fell up against me and said she'd be my wife.... And it wasn't  her fault that she wasn't.\"    \"What did she do?\"    \"Do! What didn't she do? Next day she went down to our place when I  was at work, and hugged and kissed mother and the girls all round, and  cried, and told mother that she'd try and be a dutiful daughter to her.  Good Lord! You should have seen the old woman and the girls when I came  home.    \"Then she let everyone know that Bridget Page was engaged to Jack  Mitchell, and told her friends that she went down on her knees every  night and thanked the Lord for getting the love of a good man. Didn't  the fellows chyack me, though! My sisters were raving mad about it, for  their chums kept asking them how they liked their new sister, and when  it was going to come off, and who'd be bridesmaids and best man, and  whether they weren't surprised at their brother Jack's choice; and then  I'd gammon at home that it was all true.    \"At last the place got too hot for me. I got sick of dodging that girl.  I sent a mate of mine to tell her that it was all a joke, and that I was  already married in secret; but she didn't see it, then I cleared, and  got a job in Newcastle, but had to leave there when my mates sent me the  office that she was coming. I wouldn't wonder but what she is humping  her swag after me now. In fact, I thought you was her in disguise when  I set eyes on you first.... You needn't get mad about it; I don't mean to  say that you're quite as ugly as she was, because I never saw a man that  was--or a woman either. Anyway, I'll never ask a woman to marry me again  unless I'm ready to marry her.\"    Then Mitchell's mate told a yarn.    \"I knew a case once something like the one you were telling me about;  the landlady of a hash-house where I was stopping in Albany told me.  There was a young carpenter staying there, who'd run away from Sydney  from an old maid who wanted to marry him. He'd cleared from the church  door, I believe. He was scarcely more'n a boy--about nineteen--and a  soft kind of a fellow, something like you, only good-looking--that is,  he was passable. Well, as soon as the woman found out where he'd gone,  she came after him. She turned up at the boarding-house one Saturday  morning when Bobbie was at work; and the first thing she did was to rent  a double room from the landlady and buy some cups and saucers to start  housekeeping with. When Bobbie came home he just gave her one look and  gave up the game.    \"'Get your dinner, Bobbie,' she said, after she'd slobbered over him a  bit, 'and then get dressed and come with me and get married!'    \"She was about three times his age, and had a face like that picture of  a lady over Sappho Smith's letters in the Sydney _Bulletin_.    \"Well, Bobbie went with her like a--like a lamb; never gave a kick or  tried to clear.\"    \"Hold on,\" said Mitchell, \"did you ever shear lambs?\"    \"Never mind. Let me finish the yarn. Bobbie was married; but she  wouldn't let him out of her sight all that afternoon, and he had to put  up with her before them all. About bedtime he sneaked out and started  along the passage to his room that he shared with two or three mates.  But"]]]
