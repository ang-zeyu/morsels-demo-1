For each of these reasons Manzoni represents a force potent  in upbuilding Italian character and strengthening it at the time of its  great crisis. Though he drew suggestions from abroad, he made his work  Italian, and thoroughly Italian. \"If,\" says De Sanctis, \"the Romantic  School, by its name, its ties, its studies, its impressions, was allied  to German traditions and French fashions, it was at bottom Italian  in accent, aspiration, form, and motive.... Every one felt our hopes  palpitating under the mediaeval robe; the least allusion, the remotest  meanings, were caught by the public, which was in the closest accord  with the writers. The middle ages were no longer treated with historical  and positive intention; they became the garments of our ideals, the  transparent expression of our hopes.\"    Alessandro Manzoni was born in Milan, March 7, 1785, at about the time  when Alfieri was accomplishing his greatest work. His father, Pietro  Manzoni, belonged to the nobility, and bore the title of Count, a title  which Alessandro, when he inherited it at an early age, refused to  adopt, and continued to refuse to use during his whole life. His mother  was the daughter of Beccaria, a man well known throughout Europe for  his studies of political economy and criminology, and whose treatise  entitled \"Crimes and Punishments\" was greatly admired in the Voltairean  circles of France. Alessandro's mother was a remarkably intelligent  woman, with a fineness of nature which was inherited by her son, and  which kept him unspoiled and simple through a life unusually acclaimed  and applauded.    His earliest youth was spent among the hills of Galbiate, according to  the custom of wealthy Lombard families, to send their children to the  mountains in order to give them rugged health. The boy was in care of  a woman who was successively his nurse and governess, and who taught  him to read and stirred his interest in the legends and history of the  neighboring countryside. When still a small boy he was sent to the  church college of the Frati Lomaschi, education being then entirely  in charge of ecclesiastics. He seems to have been in no wise an apt  student, the close confinement, the strict discipline, and the dry  manner of teaching subjects which were all of an eminently classical  nature combining to dull his spirits and interest. Stories are current  in Milan of Manzoni's inability to learn, almost bordering on stupidity,  but such stories are popular of men who have later shown great ability,  and deserve little credence. Suffice it that he showed no great aptitude  for learning at the school of the Frati Lomaschi, nor even later at  the Collegio dei Nobili. At the latter he did, however, meet the poet  Vincenzo Monti, a man well known throughout Italy, who had had for  patrons the Cardinals Borghese and Braschi, a poet and dramatist whose  pen was too apt to serve the political party in power, but who had  achieved wide popularity, and whose poems were praised by critics as  diverse-minded as Byron and Napoleon Bonaparte. Monti met the young  Manzoni when he was on a visit to the college, and took an interest in  him. Alessandro admired the poet, and it was perhaps this acquaintance  which first actively interested him in literature as a pursuit. The  meeting of the boy Walter Scott with Robert Burns is a parallel in  Scottish literary annals.    In 1805, when he was twenty, Alessandro's father died and the youth  left the Collegio dei Nobili, and returned for a time to his mother.  After a period of home life he was sent to the University of Pavia,  the best-known of Lombard universities. His stay here was short. His  mother, now a widow for several years, was advised to go to France for  her health, and the close bonds which united mother and son would not  allow of such a distant separation. Alessandro left the University and  went with his mother to Auteuil, which was then a fashionable watering  place where the _beau monde_ of French art and letters gathered. Here  and at Paris he met the leading thinkers of the time, Volney, Cabanis,  De Tracy, Fauriel, and Condorcet, all of whom were interested in the  young man as the grandson of Beccaria and because of his own originality  of thought. These men called themselves idealogues, and claimed to  have shaken off all the conventions of the previous centuries. As a  student Manzoni had been an extremely liberal Catholic, and was usually  considered by strict critics a follower of Voltaire. At Paris and  Auteuil, however, he met so many men of the then prevalent atheistic  mode of thought that his own interest in his family religion was  quickened and he emerged from his friendship with such men as Cabanis  and Condorcet a more pronounced churchman than he had been before. It  was characteristic of him to cling tenaciously to those precedents and  standards which had so long survived in his own country. His religion,  however, was soon to become more to him than a field for philosophic  speculation, for in 1810 he married Louise Henriette Blondel, daughter  of a banker of Geneva, who, herself a convert from Protestantism to the  Church of Rome, became most ardent in the church of her adoption. She  soon brought Alessandro to her own enthusiastic view, and from the date  of his marriage his philosophy never varied. Henriette Manzoni possessed  rare beauty, and was long remembered in Milan \"for her fresh blond head,  and her blue eyes, her lovely eyes,\" and the young husband was ideally  happy with his bride. He had by now determined to try his skill at  composition, and set himself as models the three men whose fame was then  at its height in Italy, Alfieri, Vincenzo Monti, and Ugo Foscolo.    His bride had brought Manzoni a country seat as well as considerable  property, and so he settled in the country and studied to perfect his  style in writing. His first works were a series of Sacred Hymns, written  directly under the influence of the renewed religious faith attendant  on his marriage. These were published in 1815, and were at once noticed  as poems alike remarkable for deep religious feeling and great beauty  of expression. Appearing as they did at a time when religion was being  bitterly assailed, churchmen looked upon the young poet as a distinct  acquisition to their forces. Manzoni was not, however, even then a  believer in the temporal power of the Pope. He said to Madame Colet, the  author of \"L'Italie des Italiens,\" \"I bow humbly to the Pope, and the  Church has no more respectful son; but why confound the interests of  earth and those of heaven? The Roman people are right in asking their  freedom--there are hours for nations, as for governments, in which they  must occupy themselves, not with what is convenient, but with what is  just. Let us lay hands boldly upon the temporal power, but let us not  touch the doctrine of the Church. The one is as distinct from the other  as the immortal soul from the frail and mortal body. To believe that  the Church is attacked in taking away its earthly possessions is a real  heresy to every true Christian.\"    This was the same view which Manzoni held throughout his life, and  which, stated in his quoted words, gives the position taken by the most  enlightened men of the Nationalist party in those later days when the  question of the temporal power of the Pope became vital for Italy. What  the Sacred Hymns showed was that Manzoni looked to the Church as the  center of all true aspiration and religion rather than to philosophic  theories as the safeguard of morals.    His next production carried him a step further in advance of his  contemporaries, and marked him as the leader of the Romantic School.  In 1819 he wrote his first tragedy, published the following year under  the title \"Il Conte di Carmagnola.\" The subject-matter was the career  of Carmagnola, a celebrated condottiere of the Middle Ages, and the  dramatic form was entirely distinct from that classic construction which  had so long tyrannized over the drama. In an introduction he explains  his departure from the classic unities of time, place, and action, and  gives his reasons for believing that the dramatist should be free to  choose his own subject and to treat it in such fashion as shall seem to  him best to express his idea. The Elizabethan dramatists had long before  discarded the law of the unities in England, and had carried their plots  over such courses of time and place as they pleased, and so had Schiller  in Germany, but in Italy the law had been absolute from the time of  Tasso to that of Alfieri. Eight years after Manzoni's \"Carmagnola\"  appeared, Victor Hugo brought on the great dramatic war in France with  his \"Cromwell,\" and from the date of his ultimate triumph in Paris dates  the downfall of the Classicists and the full glory of the Romanticists.    In Italy Manzoni's step was violently attacked and defended.  Conservatives opposed him, but the younger element immediately acclaimed  him as their leader. The following year, 1821, he wrote his great ode on  the death of Napoleon, which had occurred on May 5th, at St. Helena, and  the news of which had greatly affected all Europe. The ode, entitled \"Il  Cinque Maggio,\" was remarkable for great dignity, a deep and profound  estimate of Napoleon's genius, and a tribute to his colossal fame which  even the French recognized as the fittest expression of poetic power.  The ode was at once translated into German by Goethe, and into English  by Gladstone and the Earl of Derby. It immediately placed him at the  head of the new school of continental poets.    Very soon afterwards, in 1822, Manzoni wrote his second tragedy,  \"Adelchi,\" a drama of the war between the Lombards and Charlemagne. It  followed the lines of the Carmagnola, repeating the break from classical  precedents, and establishing the value of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#7)"],[1,"guns, and thence to  the camp of General Taylor at Corpus Christi.  This was the first  company of our regiment sent to the seat of war, and it embarked on  the brig Hayne.  This was the only company that left Fort Moultrie  till after I was detached for recruiting service on the 1st of May,  1846.    Inasmuch as Charleston afterward became famous, as the spot where  began our civil war, a general description of it, as it was in  1846, will not be out of place.    The city lies on a long peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper  Rivers--a low, level peninsula, of sand.  Meeting Street is its  Broadway, with King Street, next west and parallel, the street of  shops and small stores.  These streets are crossed at right angles  by many others, of which Broad Street was the principal; and the  intersection of Meeting and Broad was the heart of the city, marked  by the Guard-House and St. Michael's Episcopal Church.  The  Custom-House, Post-Office, etc., were at the foot of Broad Street,  near the wharves of the Cooper River front.  At the extremity of  the peninsula was a drive, open to the bay, and faced by some of  the handsomest houses of the city, called the \"Battery.\"  Looking  down the bay on the right, was James Island, an irregular triangle  of about seven miles, the whole island in cultivation with  sea-island cotton.  At the lower end was Fort Johnson, then simply  the station of Captain Bowman, United States Engineers, engaged in  building Fort Sumter.  This fort (Sumter) was erected on an  artificial island nearly in mid-channel, made by dumping rocks,  mostly brought as ballast in cotton-ships from the North.  As the  rock reached the surface it was levelled, and made the foundation  of Fort Sumter.  In 1846 this fort was barely above the water.  Still farther out beyond James Island, and separated from it by a  wide space of salt marsh with crooked channels, was Morris Island,  composed of the sand-dunes thrown up by the wind and the sea,  backed with the salt marsh.  On this was the lighthouse, but no  people.    On the left, looking down the bay from the Battery of Charleston,  was, first, Castle Pinckney, a round brick fort, of two tiers of  guns, one in embrasure, the other in barbette, built on a marsh  island, which was not garrisoned.  Farther down the bay a point of  the mainland reached the bay, where there was a group of houses,  called Mount Pleasant; and at the extremity of the bay, distant six  miles, was Sullivan's Island, presenting a smooth sand-beach to the  sea, with the line of sand-hills or dunes thrown up by the waves  and winds, and the usual backing of marsh and crooked salt-water  channels.    At the shoulder of this island was Fort Moultrie, an irregular  fort, without ditch or counterscarp, with a brick scarp wall about  twelve feet high, which could be scaled anywhere, and this was  surmounted by an earth parapet capable of mounting about forty  twenty-four and thirty-two pounder smooth-bore iron guns.  Inside  the fort were three two-story brick barracks, sufficient to quarter  the officers and men of two companies of artillery.    At sea was the usual \"bar,\" changing slightly from year to year,  but generally the main ship-channel came from the south, parallel  to Morris Island, till it was well up to Fort Moultrie, where it  curved, passing close to Fort Sumter and up to the wharves of the  city, which were built mostly along the Cooper River front.    Charleston was then a proud, aristocratic city, and assumed a  leadership in the public opinion of the South far out of proportion  to her population, wealth, or commerce.  On more than one occasion  previously, the inhabitants had almost inaugurated civil war, by  their assertion and professed belief that each State had, in the  original compact of government, reserved to itself the right to  withdraw from the Union at its own option, whenever the people  supposed they had sufficient cause.  We used to discuss these  things at our own mess-tables, vehemently and sometimes quite  angrily; but I am sure that I never feared it would go further than  it had already gone in the winter of 1832-'33, when the attempt at  \"nullification\" was promptly suppressed by President Jackson's  famous declaration, \"The Union must and shall be preserved!\" and by  the judicious management of General Scott.    Still, civil war was to be; and, now that it has come and gone, we  can rest secure in the knowledge that as the chief cause, slavery,  has been eradicated forever, it is not likely to come again.          CHAPTER II.    EARLY RECOLLECTIONS of CALIFORNIA.    1846-1848.      In the spring of 1846 I was a first lieutenant of Company C,1,  Third Artillery, stationed at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina.  The  company was commanded by Captain Robert Anderson; Henry B. Judd was  the senior first-lieutenant, and I was the junior first-lieutenant,  and George B. Ayres the second-lieutenant.  Colonel William Gates  commanded the post and regiment, with First-Lieutenant William  Austine as his adjutant.  Two other companies were at the post,  viz., Martin Burke's and E. D. Keyes's, and among the officers were  T. W. Sherman, Morris Miller, H. B. Field, William Churchill,  Joseph Stewart, and Surgeon McLaren.    The country now known as Texas had been recently acquired, and war  with Mexico was threatening.  One of our companies (Bragg's), with  George H. Thomas, John F. Reynolds, and Frank Thomas, had gone the  year previous and was at that time with General Taylor's army at  Corpus Christi, Texas.    In that year (1846) I received the regular detail for recruiting  service, with orders to report to the general superintendent at  Governor's Island, New York; and accordingly left Fort Moultrie in  the latter part of April, and reported to the superintendent,  Colonel R. B. Mason, First Dragoons, at New York, on the 1st day of  May.  I was assigned to the Pittsburg rendezvous, whither I  proceeded and relieved Lieutenant Scott.  Early in May I took up my  quarters at the St. Charles Hotel, and entered upon the discharge  of my duties.  There was a regular recruiting-station already  established, with a sergeant, corporal, and two or three men, with  a citizen physician, Dr. McDowell, to examine the recruits.  The  threatening war with Mexico made a demand for recruits, and I  received authority to open another sub-rendezvous at Zanesville,  Ohio, whither I took the sergeant and established him.  This was  very handy to me, as my home was at Lancaster, Ohio, only  thirty-six miles off, so that I was thus enabled to visit my  friends there quite often.    In the latter part of May, when at Wheeling, Virginia, on my way  back from Zanesville to Pittsburg, I heard the first news of the  battle of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, which occurred on the  8th and 9th of May, and, in common with everybody else, felt  intensely excited.  That I should be on recruiting service, when my  comrades were actually fighting, was intolerable, and I hurried  on to my post, Pittsburg.  At that time the railroad did not  extend west of the Alleghanies, and all journeys were made by  stage-coaches.  In this instance I traveled from Zanesville to  Wheeling, thence to Washington (Pennsylvania), and thence to  Pittsburg by stage-coach.  On reaching Pittsburg I found many  private letters; one from Ord, then a first-lieutenant in Company  F, Third Artillery, at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, saying that his  company had just received orders for California, and asking me to  apply for it.  Without committing myself to that project, I wrote  to the Adjutant-General, R. Jones, at Washington, D. C., asking him  to consider me as an applicant for any active service, and saying  that I would willingly forego the recruiting detail, which I well  knew plenty of others would jump at.  Impatient to approach the  scene of active operations, without authority (and I suppose  wrongfully), I left my corporal in charge of the rendezvous, and  took all the recruits I had made, about twenty-five, in a steamboat  to Cincinnati, and turned them over to Major N. C. McCrea,  commanding at Newport Barracks.  I then reported in Cincinnati, to  the superintendent of the Western recruiting service, Colonel  Fanning, an old officer with one arm, who inquired by what  authority I had come away from my post.  I argued that I took it  for granted he wanted all the recruits he could get to forward to  the army at Brownsville, Texas; and did not know but that he might  want me to go along.  Instead of appreciating my volunteer zeal, he  cursed and swore at me for leaving my post without orders, and told  me to go back to Pittsburg.  I then asked for an order that would  entitle me to transportation back, which at first he emphatically  refused, but at last he gave the order, and I returned to  Pittsburg, all the way by stage, stopping again at Lancaster, where  I attended the wedding of my schoolmate Mike Effinger, and also  visited my sub-rendezvous at Zanesville.  R. S. Ewell, of my class,  arrived to open a cavalry rendezvous, but, finding my depot there,  he went on to Columbus, Ohio.  Tom Jordan afterward was ordered  to Zanesville, to take charge of that rendezvous, under  the general War Department orders increasing the number of  recruiting-stations.  I reached Pittsburg late in June, and found  the order relieving me from recruiting service, and detailing my  classmate H. B. Field to my place.  I was assigned to Company F,  then under orders for California.  By private letters from  Lieutenant Ord, I heard that the company had already started from  Fort McHenry for Governor's Island, New York Harbor, to take passage  for California in a naval transport.  I worked all that night, made  up my accounts current, and turned over the balance of cash to the  citizen physician, Dr. McDowell; and also closed my clothing and  property returns, leaving blank receipts with the same gentleman for  Field's signature, "]]]
