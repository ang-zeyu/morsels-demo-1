XVII. MORE MISCHIEF           Mischief's like a snowball       Sent rolling down a hill;       With every turn it bigger grows       And bigger, bigger still.    Sammy Jay had started mischief by telling Reddy Fox where Johnny Chuck's  new house was. If you had asked him, Sammy Jay would have said that he  hadn't told. All he had said was that he had happened to be up in Farmer  Brown's old orchard and so had called on Johnny Chuck in his new house.    Now Reddy Fox is very sly, oh, very sly. He had pretended to Sammy Jay  that he knew all the time where Johnny Chuck was living. When he left  Sammy Jay, he had started in the direction of the Green Meadows, just as  if he had no thought of going over to Farmer Brown's old orchard.    But Sammy Jay is just as sly as Reddy Fox. He wasn't fooled for one  minute, not one little minute. He chuckled to himself as he started to  look for Jimmy Skunk. Then he changed his mind.    \"I think I'll go up to the old orchard myself!\" said Sammy Jay, and away  he flew.    He got there first and hid in the top of a big apple-tree, where he  could see all that went on. It wasn't long before he saw Reddy Fox  steal out from the Green Forest and over to the old orchard. Reddy  was nervous, very nervous. You see, it was broad daylight, and the old  orchard was very near Farmer Brown's house. Reddy knew that he ought  to have waited until night, but he knew that then Johnny Chuck would be  fast asleep, Now, perhaps, Johnny Chuck, thinking that no one knew where  he lived, would not be on watch, and he might be able to catch Johnny.    So Reddy, with one eye on Farmer Brown's house and one eye on the watch  for some sign of Johnny Chuck, stole into the old orchard. Every few  steps he would stop and look and listen. At every little noise he would  start nervously. Then Sammy Jay would chuckle under his breath.    So Reddy Fox crept and tiptoed about through the old orchard. Every  minute he grew more nervous, and every minute he grew more disappointed,  for he could find no sign of Johnny Chuck's house. He began to think  that Sammy Jay had fooled him, and the very thought made him grind his  teeth. At last he decided to give it up.    He was down in the far corner of the old orchard, close by the old stone  wall now, and he got all ready to jump over the old stone wall, when  he just happened to look on the other side of the big apple-tree he was  under, and there was what he was looking for--Johnny Chuck's new house!  Johnny Chuck wasn't in sight, but there was the new house, and Johnny  must be either inside or not far away. Reddy grinned. It was a sly,  wicked, hungry grin. He flattened himself out in the grass behind the  big apple-tree.    \"I'll give Johnny Chuck the surprise of his life!\" muttered Reddy Fox  under his breath.    Now Sammy Jay had been watching all this time. He knew that Johnny Chuck  was safely inside his house, for Johnny had seen Reddy when he first  came into the old orchard. And Sammy knew that Johnny Chuck knew that  when Reddy found that new house, he would hide just as he had done.    \"Johnny Chuck won't come out again to-day, and there won't be any  excitement at all,\" thought Sammy Jay in disappointment, for he had  hoped to see a fight between Reddy Fox and Johnny Chuck. Just then Sammy  looked over to Farmer Brown's house, and there was Farmer Brown's boy  getting ready to saw wood. The imp of mischief under Sammy's pert cap  gave him an idea. He flew over to the old apple-tree, just over Reddy's  head, and began to scream at the top of his lungs.    Farmer Brown's boy stopped work and looked over towards the old orchard.    \"When a jay screams like that there is usually a fox around,\" he  muttered, as he unfastened Bowser the Hound.          XVIII. FARMER BROWN'S BOY MAKES A DISCOVERY      Reddy Fox glared up at Sammy Jay. \"What's the matter with you?\" snarled  Reddy Fox. \"Why don't you mind your own affairs, instead of making  trouble for other people?\" You see, Reddy was afraid that Johnny Chuck  would hear Sammy Jay and take warning.    \"Hello, Reddy Fox! I thought you had gone down to the Green Meadows!\"  Sammy said this as if he was very much surprised to see Reddy there. He  wasn't, for you know he had been watching Reddy hunt for Johnny Chuck's  new house, but Reddy had pretended that he was going down to the Green  Meadows early that morning, and so now Sammy pretended that he had  thought that Reddy really had gone.    \"I changed my mind!\" he snapped. \"What are you screaming so for?\"    \"Just to exercise my lungs, so as to be sure that I can scream when I  want to,\" replied Sammy, screaming still louder.    \"Well, go somewhere else and scream; I want to sleep,\" said Reddy  crossly.    Now Sammy Jay knew perfectly well that Reddy Fox had no thought of  taking a nap but was hiding there to try to catch Johnny Chuck. And  Sammy knew that Farmer Brown's boy could hear him scream, and that he  knew that when Sammy screamed that way it meant there was a fox about.  Sitting in the top of the apple-tree, Sammy could see Farmer Brown's  boy starting for the old orchard, with Bowser the Hound running ahead of  him.    Farmer Brown's boy had no gun, so Sammy knew that no harm would come to  Reddy, but that Reddy would get a dreadful scare; and that is what Sammy  wanted, just out of pure mischief. So he screamed louder than ever.    Reddy Fox lost his temper. He sat up and called Sammy Jay all the bad  names he could think of. He forgot where he was. He told Sammy Jay what  he thought of him and what he would do to him if ever he caught him.    Sammy Jay kept right on screaming. He made such a noise that Reddy  didn't hear footsteps coming nearer and nearer. Suddenly there was a  great roar right behind him. \"Bow, wow, wow! Bow, wow, wow, wow!\"--just  like that.    Reddy was so frightened that he didn't even look to see where he was  jumping, and bumped his head against the apple-tree. Then he started for  the Green Forest, with Bowser the Hound at his heels.    Sammy Jay laughed till he lost his breath and nearly tumbled off his  perch. Then he flew away, still laughing. He thought it the greatest  joke ever.    Farmer Brown's boy had followed Bowser the Hound into the old orchard.    \"I wonder what a fox was doing up here in broad daylight,\" said he,  talking to himself. \"Perhaps one of my hens has stolen her nest down  here, and he has found it. I'll have a look, anyway.\"    So he walked on down to the far corner of the old orchard, straight to  the place from which he had seen Reddy Fox jump. When he got there, of  course he saw Johnny Chuck's new house right away.    \"Ho!\" cried Farmer Brown's boy. \"Brer Fox was hunting Chucks. I'll keep  my eye on this, and if Mr. Chuck makes any trouble in my garden, I'll  know where to catch him.\"          XIX. JOHNNY CHUCK'S PRIDE      Ever since Farmer Brown's boy and Reddy Fox had found his new house in  the far corner of the old orchard, Johnny Chuck had been worried. It  was not that he was afraid for himself. Oh, my, no! Johnny Chuck felt  perfectly able to take care of himself. But there was Polly Chuck! He  was terribly afraid that something might happen to Polly Chuck. You see  she was not big and strong like him, and then Polly Chuck was apt to be  careless. So for a while Johnny Chuck worried a great deal.    But Reddy Fox didn't come again in daytime. You see Bowser the Hound  had given him such a scare that he didn't dare to. He sometimes came  at night and sniffed hungrily at Johnny Chuck's doorway, but Johnny and  Polly were safe inside, and this didn't trouble them a bit. And Farmer  Brown's boy seemed to have forgotten all about the new house. So after  a while Johnny Chuck stopped worrying so much. The fact is Johnny Chuck  had something else to think about. He had a secret. Yes, Sir, Johnny  Chuck had a secret.    Sammy Jay came up to the old orchard almost every morning. His sharp  eyes were not long in finding out that Johnny Chuck had a secret, but  try as he would he could not find out what that secret was. Whatever it  was, it made Johnny Chuck very happy. He would come out on his doorstep  and smile and sometimes give a funny little whistle of pure joy.    It puzzled Sammy Jay a great deal. He couldn't see why Johnny Chuck  should be any happier than he ever was. To be sure it was a happy time  of year. Everybody was happy, for it was spring-time, and the Green  Forest and the Green Meadows, even the Old Pasture, were very lovely.  But somehow Sammy Jay felt sure that it was something more than this, a  secret that Johnny Chuck was keeping all to himself, that was making him  so happy. But what it was, Sammy Jay couldn't imagine. He spent so much  time thinking about it and wondering what it could be, that it actually  kept him out of mischief.    One morning Johnny Chuck came out, looking happier than ever. He  chuckled and chuckled as only a happy Chuck can. Then he did foolish  things. He kicked up his heels. He rolled over and over in the grass. He  whistled. He even tried to sing, which is something no Chuck can do or  should ever try to do. Then suddenly he scrambled to his feet, carefully  brushed his coat, and tried to look very dignified. He strutted back  and forth in front of his doorway, as if he was very proud of something.  There was pride in the very way in which he took each step. There was  pride in the very way in which he held his head. It was too much for  Sammy Jay.    \"What are you so proud about, Johnny Chuck?\" he demanded, in his harsh  voice, \"If I didn't have a better looking coat than you've got, I  wouldn't put on airs!\"    You know Sammy Jay is very proud of his own handsome blue and white coat  and dearly loves to show it off.    \"It isn't that,\" said Johnny Chuck.    \"Well, if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#7)"],[1,"  Opposite to it is the  cemetery now in use, and I remember well my first visit to it under  the guidance of a gloomy Government official, who said he always  walked there every afternoon, \"so as to get used to the place before  staying permanently in it,\"--a rank waste of time and energy, by the  way, as subsequent events proved, for he is now safe off the Gold  Coast for good and all.    He took me across the well-kept grass to two newly dug graves, each  covered with wooden hoods in a most business-like way.  Evidently  those hoods were regular parts of the cemetery's outfit.  He said  nothing, but waved his hand with a \"take-your-choice,-they-are-both-  quite-ready\" style.  \"Why?\" I queried laconically.  \"Oh! we always  keep two graves ready dug for Europeans.  We have to bury very  quickly here, you know,\" he answered.  I turned at bay.  I had had  already a very heavy dose of details of this sort that afternoon and  was disinclined to believe another thing.  So I said, \"It's  exceedingly wrong to do a thing like that, you only frighten people  to death.  You can't want new-dug graves daily.  There are not  enough white men in the whole place to keep the institution up.\"  \"We do,\" he replied, \"at any rate at this season.  Why, the other  day we had two white men to bury before twelve o'clock, and at four,  another dropped in on a steamer.\"    \"At 4.30,\" said a companion, an exceedingly accurate member of the  staff.  \"How you fellows DO exaggerate!\"  Subsequent knowledge of  the Gold Coast has convinced me fully that the extra funeral being  placed half-an-hour sooner than it occurred is the usual percentage  of exaggeration you will be able to find in stories relating to the  local mortality.  And at Accra, after I left it, and all along the  Gold Coast, came one of those dreadful epidemic outbursts sweeping  away more than half the white population in a few weeks.    But to return to our state journey along the Christiansborg road.  We soon reached the castle, an exceedingly roomy and solid edifice  built by the Danes, and far better fitted for the climate than our  modern dwellings, in spite of our supposed advance in tropical  hygiene.  We entered by the sentry-guarded great gate into the  courtyard; on the right hand were the rest of the guard; most of  them asleep on their mats, but a few busy saying Dhikr, etc.,  towards Mecca, like the good Mohammedans these Haussas are, others  winding themselves into their cummerbunds.  On the left hand was Sir  Brandford Griffiths' hobby--a choice and select little garden, of  lovely eucharis lilies mostly in tubs, and rare and beautiful  flowers brought by him from his Barbadian home; while shading it and  the courtyard was a fine specimen of that superb thing of beauty--a  flamboyant tree--glorious with its delicate-green acacia-like leaves  and vermilion and yellow flowers, and astonishing with its vast  beans.  A flight of stone stairs leads from the courtyard to the  upper part of the castle where the living rooms are, over the  extensive series of cool tunnel-like slave barracoons, now used as  store chambers.  The upper rooms are high and large, and full of a  soft pleasant light and the thunder of the everlasting surf breaking  on the rocky spit on which the castle is built.    From the day the castle was built, now more than a hundred years  ago, the surf spray has been swept by the on-shore evening breeze  into every chink and cranny of the whole building, and hence the  place is mouldy--mouldy to an extent I, with all my experience in  that paradise for mould, West Africa, have never elsewhere seen.  The matting on the floors took an impression of your foot as a light  snowfall would.  Beneath articles of furniture the cryptogams  attained a size more in keeping with the coal period than with the  nineteenth century.    The Gold Coast is one of the few places in West Africa that I have  never felt it my solemn duty to go and fish in.  I really cannot say  why.  Seen from the sea it is a pleasant looking land.  The long  lines of yellow, sandy beach backed by an almost continuous line of  blue hills, which in some places come close to the beach, in other  places show in the dim distance.  It is hard to think that it is so  unhealthy as it is, from just seeing it as you pass by.  It has high  land and has not those great masses of mangrove-swamp one usually,  at first, associates with a bad fever district, but which prove on  acquaintance to be at any rate no worse than this well-elevated  open-forested Gold Coast land.  There are many things to be had here  and in Lagos which tend to make life more tolerable, that you cannot  have elsewhere until you are south of the Congo.  Horses, for  example, do fairly well at Accra, though some twelve miles or so  behind the town there is a belt of tsetse fly, specimens of which I  have procured and had identified at the British Museum, and it is  certain death to a horse, I am told, to take it to Aburi.    The food-supply, although bad and dear, is superior to that you get  down south.  Goats and sheep are fairly plentiful.  In addition to  fresh meat and tinned you are able to get a quantity of good sea  fish, for the great West African Bank, which fringes the coast in  the Bight of Benin, abounds in fish, although the native cook very  rarely knows how to cook them.  Then, too, you can get more fruit  and vegetables on the Gold Coast than at most places lower down:  the plantain, {28} not least among them and very good when allowed  to become ripe, and then cut into longitudinal strips, and properly  fried; the banana, which surpasses it when served in the same  manner, or beaten up and mixed with rice, butter, and eggs, and  baked.  Eggs, by the way, according to the great mass of native  testimony, are laid in this country in a state that makes them more  fit for electioneering than culinary purposes, and I shall never  forget one tribe I was once among, who, whenever I sat down on one  of their benches, used to smash eggs round me for ju-ju.  They meant  well.  But I will nobly resist the temptation to tell egg stories  and industriously catalogue the sour-sop, guava, grenadilla,  aubergine or garden-egg, yam, and sweet potato.    The sweet potato should be boiled, and then buttered and browned in  an oven, or fried.  When cooked in either way I am devoted to them,  but in the way I most frequently come across them I abominate them,  for they jeopardise my existence both in this world and the next.  It is this way:  you are coming home from a long and dangerous  beetle-hunt in the forest; you have battled with mighty beetles the  size of pie dishes, they have flown at your head, got into your hair  and then nipped you smartly.  You have been also considerably stung  and bitten by flies, ants, etc., and are most likely sopping wet  with rain, or with the wading of streams, and you are tired and your  feet go low along the ground, and it is getting, or has got, dark  with that ever-deluding tropical rapidity, and then you for your  sins get into a piece of ground which last year was a native's farm,  and, placing one foot under the tough vine of a surviving sweet  potato, concealed by rank herbage, you plant your other foot on  another portion of the same vine.  Your head you then deposit  promptly in some prickly ground crop, or against a tree stump, and  then, if there is human blood in you, you say d--n!    Then there are also alligator-pears, limes, and oranges.  There is  something about those oranges I should like to have explained.  They  are usually green and sweetish in taste, nor have they much white  pith, but now and again you get a big bright yellow one from those  trees that have been imported, and these are very pithy and in full  possession of the flavour of verjuice.  They have also got the papaw  on the Coast, the Carica papaya of botanists.  It is an insipid  fruit.  To the newcomer it is a dreadful nuisance, for no sooner  does an old coaster set eyes on it than he straightway says, \"Paw-  paws are awfully good for the digestion, and even if you just hang a  tough fowl or a bit of goat in the tree among the leaves, it gets  tender in no time, for there is an awful lot of pepsine in a paw-  paw,\"--which there is not, papaine being its active principle.  After hearing this hymn of praise to the papaw some hundreds of  times, it palls, and you usually arrive at this tired feeling about  the thing by the time you reach the Gold Coast, for it is a most  common object, and the same man will say the same thing about it a  dozen times a day if he gets the chance.  I got heartily sick of it  on my first voyage out, and rashly determined to check the old  coaster in this habit of his, preparatory to stamping the practice  out.  It was one of my many failures.  I soon met an old coaster  with a papaw fruit in sight, and before he had time to start, I  boldly got away with \"The paw-paw is awfully good for the  digestion,\" hoping that this display of knowledge would impress him  and exempt me from hearing the rest of the formula.  But no.  \"Right  you are,\" said he solemnly.  \"It's a powerful thing is the paw-paw.  Why, the other day we had a sad case along here.  You know what a  nuisance young assistants are, bothering about their chop, and  scorpions in their beds and boots, and what not and a half, and  then, when you have pulled them through these, and often enough  before, pegging out with fever, or going on the fly in the native  town.  Did you know poor B---?  Well! he's dead now, had fever and  went off like a babe in eight hours though he'd been out fourteen  years for A--- and D---.  They sent him out a new book-keeper, a  tender young thing with a dairymaid complexion and the notion that  he'd got the indigestion.  He fidgeted about it something awful.  One night there was a big paw-paw on the table for evening chop, and  so B---, who was an awfully good chap, told him about how good it  "]]]
