On coming here to-day I find that everything has been  rearranged, completely spoiling the effect I had obtained. You and your  friends are the only ones who have been here this afternoon. It looks  like a clear case of spite on your part.\"    During Eleanor's angry outburst the boys looked decidedly uncomfortable,  then by common consent moved away a little. This was a matter that the  girls alone could settle.    Then Miriam Nesbit stepped forward with all the dignity that she could  summon to her aid.    \"Miss Savelli,\" she said quietly, \"it is absolutely childish and  ridiculous for you to make the assertions you have. No one of us has the  slightest curiosity as to either you or your arrangements. This is not  the first time that you have publicly accused us of meddling. Now I want  you to understand once and for all that this must cease. You should not  jump at conclusions and then vent your rage upon innocent bystanders.    \"This much I will say as a matter of information, that we were not the  only ones here this afternoon, as several of your particular friends  spent some time in your booth, and I should advise that you call them to  account and let us alone. Come on, girls,\" she said, turning to Grace  and her friends, \"we mustn't waste any more time.\"    With this Miriam turned her back squarely upon Eleanor, and without  giving her time to reply, walked to the other end of the hall.    The girls were not slow in joining her, and in a moment Eleanor was left  alone in the middle of the hall, with the unpleasant realization that  for once she had overshot the mark.          CHAPTER VI    THE THANKSGIVING BAZAAR      The bazaar was at its height. No one would have guessed that staid old  Assembly Hall could lend itself to such levity.    At one end a band of gypsies had pitched their tents in true Romany  fashion. There were dark-eyed gypsy maids in gaudy clothing, who gayly  jingled their tambourines and wheedled good-natured sightseers into  their main tent with extravagant stories of the wonderful Romany dancing  girls whose unequaled dancing might be seen for the small sum of ten  cents. While aged gypsies crouched here and there croaking mysteriously  of their power to reveal the future, and promising health, wealth and  happiness to those who crossed their out-stretched palms with silver.    In front of one of the tents several gypsy boys sat grouped in  picturesque attitudes, industriously twanging guitars and mandolins. The  whole encampment was lighted by flaring torches on the ends of long  poles, and was the final touch needed to give the true gypsy effect.    The rest of the space in the hall had been given up to booths. There  was, of course, a Japanese booth, while across from it several Mexican  seniors and senoritas were doing an enterprising novelty and post-card  business under the red, white and green flag of Mexico.    There was a cunning little English tea shop, where one could refresh  one's self with tea, cakes and jam, not to mention the booth devoted to  good old Ireland, presided over by Nora O'Malley who, dressed as an  Irish colleen, sang the \"Wearing of the Green\" and \"The Harp That Once  Thro' Tara's Hall,\" with true Irish fervor, while she disposed of boxes  of home-made candy tied with green ribbon that people bought for the  pleasure of hearing her sing.    Next to the gypsy encampment, however, the feature of the evening was  the booth entrusted to Eleanor Savelli. It was a veritable corner in  Italy, and it may be said to Eleanor's credit that she had worked  untiringly to carry out her idea. She had furnished the peasant costumes  for herself and three of her friends, and knew exactly how they were to  be worn, and had spared no expense in the matter of fruit and flowers  which were to be sold at a good profit. There were little bags of  home-made confetti that were sure to be popular and various other  attractive features truly Italian that Eleanor had spent much time and  trouble in procuring and arranging.    There had been a heated altercation, however, between Eleanor and Edna  Wright on the day after Eleanor had astonished Grace and her friends by  her fiery outburst, Edna having admitted that she had been responsible  for the changes that had aroused Eleanor's ire.    A quarrel had ensued, in which Edna, having been worsted, had retired  from the field in tears, refusing to have anything further to do with  Eleanor or her booth. At this juncture Miss Tebbs had appeared on the  scene, and peace was restored, although Edna was still taciturn and  sulky, and displayed little interest in what went on around her.    From the moment the doors were opened the citizens of Oakdale looked  inside, feeling particularly good-natured after their Thanksgiving  dinners, and prepared to spend their money.    \"It's perfectly wonderful what these children have managed to do on  nothing whatever,\" Miss Thompson was saying, as she and Mrs. Nesbit, in  the guise of sightseers, were strolling down the middle of the hall.    \"It looks to me like a scene from an opera,\" replied Mrs. Nesbit.    \"Yes, we are all very prosperous and clean comic opera gypsies, Mrs.  Nesbit,\" said Hippy Wingate, who had come up just in time to hear Mrs.  Nesbit's remark.    \"Why, Hippy Wingate, I never should have recognized you. You look like  the big smuggler in 'Carmen.' I have forgotten his name.\"    \"I am a smuggler, Mrs. Nesbit,\" put in Hippy mysteriously. \"But don't  give me away. It's not lace goods I've brought over the border, nor  bales of silk and such things. Isn't that what gypsies are supposed  usually to smuggle?\"    \"I believe it is,\" answered Mrs. Nesbit. \"At least they always appear in  plays and pictures seated at the foot of a high, rocky cliff in some  lonely spot, with bales and casks and strange looking bundles about. No  one would be heartless enough to ask what was inside the bundles, but I  have always had a strong suspicion that it was excelsior.\"    \"What have you been smuggling, Hippy?\" asked Miss Thompson. \"I wonder  you managed to get it past that line of watchful gipsy girls.\"    \"I won't give it away,\" replied Hippy. \"It's a surprise. You'll see, and  I wager it will be the talk of the place before the evening is over.\"    \"Is it animal, vegetable or mineral, Hippy?\" demanded Mrs. Nesbit.    \"Animal,\" replied Hippy. \"Very much animal.\"    \"Now, what in the world,\" the two women exclaimed, their curiosity  piqued.    \"Hippy, I wish you would come on and get to work,\" called Grace over her  shoulder, as she hurried past, and Hippy darted after her, remembering  that he had not done a thing that evening to assist the girls.    \"How fine Grace Harlowe does look, Mrs. Nesbit,\" remarked Miss Thompson,  \"and how I shall miss her when she leaves the High School! The time goes  too quickly to suit me, when all these nice girls leave us for college.\"    Miss Thompson still cherished a deep regard for Grace, although, since  the circumstance of Grace's refusal to betray Eleanor, narrated in  \"Grace Harlowe's Junior Year at High School,\" the two had never  returned to quite the same footing as formerly.    Grace was, indeed, the picture of a beautiful gipsy girl who in romance  turns out not to be a gipsy at all, but a princess stolen in her youth.  She wore a skirt of red trimmed in black and yellow, a full white blouse  and a little black velvet bolero. Around her waist she had tied a gayly  colored sash, while on her head was a gipsy headdress bordered with gold  fringe.    \"Hippy,\" commanded Grace, \"will you please take this gong and announce  that the auction is about to begin!\"    \"Certainly, certainly,\" answered Hippy. \"Anything to oblige the ladies.\"    He mounted a chair and beat on the Japanese gong.    \"This way, ladies and gentlemen. Come right this way! The 'Mystery  Auction' will now commence. It is a sale of surprises. You never know  what you are going to draw, but it's sure to be something nice.  Everybody step this way, please. These interesting and mysterious  packages are to be sold each to the highest bidder. But no man knoweth  what he draweth. It is the way of life, ladies, but that's where the fun  comes in, and it's sportsmanlike to take your chances, gentlemen.\"    By this time Hippy had drawn a crowd of curious people about the booth  devoted to that purpose, in which were piled dozens of packages of  various shapes and sizes, all done up in white tissue paper and tied  with red ribbons.    Hippy picked up the first bundle.    \"Is there anyone here who will make a bid on this interesting package?\"  he cried. \"It may contain treasure. Who knows? It may contain fruits  from the tropics, or the spices of Araby, or--\"    \"I'll bid ten cents,\" called a voice.    \"Ten cents!\" exclaimed Hippy in mock horror. \"I ask you, dear friend,  can our gymnasium be builded upon ten cents? Is there no one here who is  thinking of our late, lamented gymnasium? Have we already forgotten that  dear, departed hall of youthful pleasures, cut down in the flower of its  youth so tragically?\"    Hippy's voice rang out like an old-time orator's, and some one bid  twenty-five cents. But the bidding ended there, and Farmer Benson got  the package, which on being opened, was found to contain a beautiful  little lacquer box. This was a lucky beginning. If the packages all held  such treasures they were well worth bidding on. Then the fun grew fast  and furious. Everybody began bidding, and a pound of sugar actually went  for five dollars, to old Mr. McDonald, who had obstinately refused to  give up to his opponent, Mr. Barber, in the bidding contest. Mr. Harlowe  paid heavily for a cook book, while David Nesbit, for fifty cents, drew  a splendid big"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#7)"],[1,"its note:  What comrade will come to its call.            [_He takes the silver hunting-horn and blows on          it. During the long-sustained notes he keeps his          eyes expectantly on the bird. A movement in the          background. Fafner, in the form of a monstrous          lizard-like dragon, has risen from his lair in the          cave. He breaks through the underwood and drags          himself up to the higher ground, so that the front          part of his body rests on it, while he utters a          loud sound, as if yawning._    SIEGFRIED            [_Looks round and gazes at Fafner in astonishment.          He laughs._        My horn with its note      Has allured something lovely;  A jolly companion wert thou.    FAFNER            [_At the sight of Siegfried has paused on the high          ground, and remains there._        What is that?    SIEGFRIED        If thou art a beast      Who can use its tongue,  Perchance thou couldst teach me something.      Here stands one      Who would learn to fear;  Say, wilt thou be his teacher?    FAFNER        Is this insolence?    SIEGFRIED        Courage or insolence,      What matter?  With my sword I will slay thee,  Wilt thou not teach me to fear.    FAFNER [_Makes a laughing sound._        Drink I came for;      Now food I find too!            [_He opens his jaws and shows his teeth._    SIEGFRIED        What a fine set of teeth      Thou showest me there!      Sweetly they smile      In thy dainty mouth!  'Twere well if I closed up thy gullet;  Thy jaws are gaping too wide!    FAFNER        They were not made      For idle talk,      But they will serve      To swallow thee.    SIEGFRIED        Hoho! Ferocious,      Merciless churl!      I have no fancy      To be eaten.  Better it seems to me  That without delay thou shouldst die!    FAFNER [_Roaring._        Pruh! Come,      Boy, with thy boasts!    SIEGFRIED [_Draws his sword._        Beware, growler!      The boaster comes!            [_He springs towards Fafner and remains defiantly          confronting him. Fafner drags himself further up          the knoll and spits at Siegfried from his nostrils.          Siegfried avoids the poison, springs nearer, and          stands on one side. Fafner tries to reach him          with his tail. Siegfried, who is nearly caught,          springs over Fafner with one bound, and wounds him          in the tail. Fafner roars, pulls his tail angrily          away, and raises the front part of his body so          that he may throw its full weight on Siegfried,          thus offering his breast to the stroke. Siegfried          quickly looks to see where his heart is, and          thrusts his sword into it up to the hilt. Fafner          raises himself still higher in his pain, and, when          Siegfried has let go his sword and sprung aside, he          sinks on the wound._      [Illustration: Siegfried kills Fafner--See p. 56]      SIEGFRIED    Lie there, envious brute! Nothung's point home has speeded!    FAFNER [_In a weaker voice._    Who art thou, boy bold-hearted,      That hast pierced my breast?  Who stirred up thy childish soul      To the murderous deed?  Thy brain schemed not the harm      Wrought by thy hand.    SIEGFRIED    Not much have I learned,  Not even who I am;  Thou thyself with thy taunting  Stirred me to fight and to slay.    FAFNER    O boy bright-eyed,  Who knowest not yet who thou art,      Whom thou hast murdered      Hear from me.  Two mighty giants there were,      Fasolt and Fafner;  The brothers now are both fallen.      For the cursèd gold      We got from the Gods  I did Fasolt to death.      He who now guards      The hoard as dragon,  Fafner, the last remaining,  Falls, by a rosy boy slain.      Boy in thy bloom,      Watch and be wary:  He who stirred thee blind to this deed  Takes thought how to compass thy death.            [_Dying._        Mark the ending!      Think on me!    SIEGFRIED        Who was my father?      Tell, if thou canst.      Dying, thou showest,      Wild one, much wisdom.  Siegfried my name is; haply  That may help thee to guess.    FAFNER        Siegfried!...            [_He raises himself and dies._    SIEGFRIED    The dead can tell no tidings.      My living sword, lead!      Lead onward, my sword!            [_Fafner has rolled to the side in dying. Siegfried          now draws the sword from his breast. In doing so          his hand gets sprinkled with the blood; he draws it          back quickly._        The hot blood burns like fire!            [_Involuntarily he raises his fingers to his mouth          to suck the blood from them. As he looks musingly          before him his attention becomes more and more          attracted by the singing of the birds._        I almost seem  To hear the birds speaking to me.

At the same time Alberich comes out of the cleft on the  opposite side. He observes Mime, rushes on him and bars his way, as the  latter turns towards the cave._      ALBERICH        On what errand      Furtive and sly,      Knave, dost thou slink?
