It would be impossible to  believe them such when we remember that he composed verses long before  he could write; and a curious proof of the opposite fact has recently  appeared. Two letters of the elder Mr. Browning have found their way  into the market, and have been bought respectively by Mr. Dykes Campbell  and Sir F. Leighton. I give the more important of them. It was addressed  to Mr. Thomas Powell:      Dear Sir,--I hope the enclosed may be acceptable as curiosities. They  were written by Robert when quite a child. I once had nearly a hundred  of them. But he has destroyed all that ever came in his way, having a  great aversion to the practice of many biographers in recording every  trifling incident that falls in their way. He has not the slightest  suspicion that any of his very juvenile performances are in existence.  I have several of the originals by me. They are all extemporaneous  productions, nor has any one a single alteration. There was one amongst  them 'On Bonaparte'--remarkably beautiful--and had I not seen it in  his own handwriting I never would have believed it to have been the  production of a child. It is destroyed. Pardon my troubling you with  these specimens, and requesting you never to mention it, as Robert  would be very much hurt. I remain, dear sir, Your obedient servant, R.  Browning. Bank: March 11, 1843.      The letter was accompanied by a sheet of verses which have been sold  and resold, doubtless in perfect good faith, as being those to which the  writer alludes. But Miss Browning has recognized them as her father's  own impromptu epigrams, well remembered in the family, together with  the occasion on which they were written. The substitution may, from the  first, have been accidental.    We cannot think of all these vanished first-fruits of Mr. Browning's  genius without a sense of loss, all the greater perhaps that there can  have been little in them to prefigure its later forms. Their faults seem  to have lain in the direction of too great splendour of language and too  little wealth of thought; and Mr. Fox, who had read 'Incondita' and been  struck by its promise, confessed afterwards to Mr. Browning that he had  feared these tendencies as his future snare. But the imitative first  note of a young poet's voice may hold a rapture of inspiration which  his most original later utterances will never convey. It is the child  Sordello, singing against the lark.    Not even the poet's sister ever saw 'Incondita'. It was the only one of  his finished productions which Miss Browning did not read, or even  help him to write out. She was then too young to be taken into his  confidence. Its writing, however, had one important result. It procured  for the boy-poet a preliminary introduction to the valuable literary  patron and friend Mr. Fox was subsequently to be. It also supplies the  first substantial record of an acquaintance which made a considerable  impression on his personal life.    The Miss Flower, of whom mention has been made, was one of two sisters,  both sufficiently noted for their artistic gifts to have found a place  in the new Dictionary of National Biography. The elder, Eliza or Lizzie,  was a musical composer; the younger, best known as Sarah Flower Adams,  a writer of sacred verse. Her songs and hymns, including the well-known  'Nearer, my God, to Thee', were often set to music by her sister.* They  sang, I am told, delightfully together, and often without accompaniment,  their voices perfectly harmonizing with each other. Both were, in their  different ways, very attractive; both interesting, not only from their  talents, but from their attachment to each other, and the delicacy which  shortened their lives. They died of consumption, the elder in 1846, at  the age of forty-three; the younger a year later. They became acquainted  with Mrs. Browning through a common friend, Miss Sturtevant; and the  young Robert conceived a warm admiration for Miss Flower's talents,  and a boyish love for herself. She was nine years his senior; her own  affections became probably engaged, and, as time advanced, his feeling  seems to have subsided into one of warm and very loyal friendship. We  hear, indeed, of his falling in love, as he was emerging from his teens,  with a handsome girl who was on a visit at his father's house. But the  fancy died out 'for want of root.' The admiration, even tenderness, for  Miss Flower had so deep a 'root' that he never in latest life mentioned  her name with indifference. In a letter to Mr. Dykes Campbell, in 1881,  he spoke of her as 'a very remarkable person.' If, in spite of his  denials, any woman inspired 'Pauline', it can have been no other than  she. He began writing to her at twelve or thirteen, probably on the  occasion of her expressed sympathy with his first distinct effort at  authorship; and what he afterwards called 'the few utterly insignificant  scraps of letters and verse' which formed his part of the correspondence  were preserved by her as long as she lived. But he recovered and  destroyed them after his return to England, with all the other  reminiscences of those early years. Some notes, however, are extant,  dated respectively, 1841, 1842, and 1845, and will be given in their due  place.         * She also wrote a dramatic poem in five acts, entitled       'Vivia Perpetua', referred to by Mrs. Jameson in her 'Sacred       and Legendary Art', and by Leigh Hunt, when he spoke of her       in 'Blue-Stocking Revels', as 'Mrs. Adams, rare mistress of       thought and of tears.'    Mr. Fox was a friend of Miss Flower's father (Benjamin Flower, known as  editor of the 'Cambridge Intelligencer'), and, at his death, in 1829,  became co-executor to his will, and a kind of guardian to his daughters,  then both unmarried, and motherless from their infancy. Eliza's  principal work was a collection of hymns and anthems, originally  composed for Mr. Fox's chapel, where she had assumed the entire  management of the choral part of the service. Her abilities were not  confined to music; she possessed, I am told, an instinctive taste and  judgment in literary matters which caused her opinion to be much valued  by literary men. But Mr. Browning's genuine appreciation of her musical  genius was probably the strongest permanent bond between them. We shall  hear of this in his own words.

At the period at which we have arrived, which is that of his leaving  school and completing his fourteenth year, another and a significant  influence was dawning on Robert Browning's life--the influence of the  poet Shelley. Mr. Sharp writes,* and I could only state the facts  in similar words, 'Passing a bookstall one day, he saw, in a box  of second-hand volumes, a little book advertised as \"Mr. Shelley's  Atheistical Poem: very scarce.\"' . . . 'From vague remarks in reply to  his inquiries, and from one or two casual allusions, he learned that  there really was a poet called Shelley; that he had written several  volumes; that he was dead.' . . . 'He begged his mother to procure him  Shelley's works, a request not easily complied with, for the excellent  reason that not one of the local booksellers had even heard of the  poet's name. Ultimately, however, Mrs. Browning learned that what she  sought was procurable at the Olliers', in Vere Street, London.'         * 'Life of Browning', pp. 30, 31.    Mrs. Browning went to Messrs. Ollier, and brought back 'most of  Shelley's writings, all in their first edition, with the exception of  \"The Cenci\".' She brought also three volumes of the still less known  John Keats, on being assured that one who liked Shelley's works would  like these also.    Keats and Shelley must always remain connected in this epoch of  Mr. Browning's poetic growth. They indeed came to him as the two  nightingales which, he told some friends, sang together in the May-night  which closed this eventful day: one in the laburnum in his father's  garden, the other in a copper beech which stood on adjoining  ground--with the difference indeed, that he must often have listened  to the feathered singers before, while the two new human voices sounded  from what were to him, as to so many later hearers, unknown heights and  depths of the imaginative world. Their utterance was, to such a spirit  as his, the last, as in a certain sense the first, word of what  poetry can say; and no one who has ever heard him read the 'Ode to a  Nightingale', and repeat in the same subdued tones, as if continuing  his own thoughts, some line from 'Epipsychidion', can doubt that they  retained a lasting and almost equal place in his poet's heart. But the  two cannot be regarded as equals in their relation to his life, and it  would be a great mistake to impute to either any important influence  upon his genius. We may catch some fleeting echoes of Keats's melody  in 'Pippa Passes'; it is almost a commonplace that some measure  of Shelleyan fancy is recognizable in 'Pauline'. But the poetic  individuality of Robert Browning was stronger than any circumstance  through which it could be fed. It would have found nourishment in desert  air. With his first accepted work he threw off what was foreign to  his poetic nature, to be thenceforward his own never-to-be-subdued and  never-to-be-mistaken self. If Shelley became, and long remained for him,  the greatest poet of his age--of almost any age--it was not because he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6574"],[0,"Watchers of the Sky (#7)"],[1," into harbour, soon.          VIII      He was a great magician, Tycho Brahe,  But not so great that he could read the heart  Or rule the hand of princes.                               When his friend  King Frederick died, the young Prince Christian reigned;  And, round him, fool and knave made common cause  Against the magic that could pour their gold  Into a gulf of stars. This Tycho Brahe  Had grown too proud. He held them in contempt,  So they believed; for, when he spoke, their thoughts  Crept at his feet like spaniels. Junkerdom  Felt it was foolish, for he towered above it,  And so it hated him. Did he not spend  Gold that a fool could spend as quickly as he?  Were there not great estates bestowed upon him  In wisdom's name, that from the dawn of time  Had been the natural right of Junkerdom?  And would he not bequeath them to his heirs,  The children of Christine, an unfree woman?  \"Why you, sire, even you,\" they told the king,  \"He has made a laughing-stock. That horoscope  He read for you, the night when you were born,  Printed, and bound it in green velvet, too,--  Read it The whole world laughs at it. He said  That Venus was the star that ruled your fate,  And Venus would destroy you. Tycho Brahe  Inspired your royal father with the fear  That kept your youth so long in leading-strings,  The fear that every pretty hedgerow flower  Would be your Circe. So he thought to avenge  Our mockery of this peasant-girl Christine,  To whom, indeed, he plays the faithful swine,  Knowing full well his gold and silver nose  Would never win another.\"                            Thus the sky  Darkened above Uraniborg, and those  Who dwelt within it, till one evil day,  One seeming happy day, when Tycho marked  The seven-hundredth star upon his chart,  Two pompous officers from Walchendorp,  The chancellor, knocked at Tycho's eastern gate.  \"We are sent,\" they said, \"to see and to report  What use you make of these estates of yours.  Your alchemy has turned more gold to lead  Than Denmark can approve. The uses now!  Show us the uses of this work of yours.\"  Then Tycho showed his tables of the stars,  Seven hundred stars, each noted in its place  With exquisite precision, the result  Of watching heaven for five-and-twenty years.  \"And is this all?\" they said.                                They sought to invent  Some ground for damning him. The truth alone  Would serve them, as it seemed. For these were men  Who could not understand.                            \"Not all, I hope,\"  Said Tycho, \"for I think, before I die,  I shall have marked a thousand.\"                                   \"To what end?  When shall we reap the fruits of all this toil?  Show us its uses.\"                     \"In the time to come,\"  Said Tycho Brahe, \"perhaps a hundred years,  Perhaps a thousand, when our own poor names  Are quite forgotten, and our kingdoms dust,  On one sure certain day, the torch-bearers  Will, at some point of contact, see a light  Moving upon this chaos. Though our eyes  Be shut for ever in an iron sleep,  Their eyes shall see the kingdom of the law,  Our undiscovered cosmos. They shall see it--  A new creation rising from the deep,  Beautiful, whole.                    We are like men that hear  Disjointed notes of some supernal choir.  Year after year, we patiently record  All we can gather. In that far-off time,  A people that we have not known shall hear them,  Moving like music to a single end.\"    They could not understand: this life that sought  Only to bear the torch and hand it on;  And so they made report that all the dreams  Of Tycho Brahe were fruitless; perilous, too,  Since he avowed that any fruit they bore  Would fall, in distant years, to alien hands.    Little by little, Walchendorp withdrew  His rents from Tycho Brahe, accusing him  Of gross neglects. The Chapel at Roskilde  Was falling into ruin. Tycho Brahe  Was Keeper of the Bones of Oldenburg.  He must rebuild the Chapel. All the gifts  That Frederick gave to help him in his task,  Were turned to stumbling-blocks; till, one dark day,  He called his young disciples round him there,  And in that mellow library of dreams,  Lit by the dying sunset, poured his heart  And mind before them, bidding them farewell.  Through the wide-open windows as he spoke  They heard the sorrowful whisper of the sea  Ebbing and flowing around Uraniborg.  \"An end has come,\" he said, \"to all we planned.  Uraniborg has drained her treasury dry.  Your Alma Mater now must close her gates  On you, her guests; on me; and, worst of all,  On one most dear, who made this place my home.  For you are young, your homes are all to win,  And you would all have gone your separate ways  In a brief while; and, though I think you love  Your college of the skies, it could not mean  All that it meant to those who called it 'home.'    You that have worked with me, for one brief year,  Will never quite forget Uraniborg.  This room, the sunset gilding all those books,  The star-charts and that old celestial globe,  The long bright evenings by the winter fire,  Of Tycho Brahe were fruitless; perilous  The talk that opened heaven, the songs you sung,  Yes, even, I think, the tricks you played with Jeppe,  Will somehow, when yourselves are growing old,  Be hallowed into beauty, touched with tears,  For you will wish they might be yours again.    These have been mine for five-and-twenty years,  And more than these,--the work, the dreams I shared  With you, and others here. My heart will break  To leave them. But the appointed time has come  As it must come to all men.                              You and I  Have watched too many constant stars to dream  That heaven or earth, the destinies of men  Or nations, are the sport of chance. An end  Comes to us all through blindness, age, or death.  If mine must come in exile, it stall find me  Bearing the torch as far as I can bear it,  Until I fall at the feet of the young runner,  Who takes it from me, and carries it out of sight,  Into the great new age I shall not know,  Into the great new realms I must not tread.  Come, then, swift-footed, let me see you stand  Waiting before me, crowned with youth and joy,  At the next turning. Take it from my hand,  For I am almost ready now to fall.    Something I have achieved, yes, though I say it,  I have not loitered on that fiery way.  And if I front the judgment of the wise  In centuries to come, with more of dread  Than my destroyers, it is because this work  Will be of use, remembered and appraised,  When all their hate is dead.                               I say the work,  Not the blind rumour, the glory or fame of it.  These observations of seven hundred stars  Are little enough in sight of those great hosts  Which nightly wheel around us, though I hope,  Yes, I still hope, in some more generous land  To make my thousand up before I die.  Little enough, I know,--a midget's work!  The men that follow me, with more delicate art  May add their tens of thousands; yet my sum  Will save them just that five-and-twenty years  Of patience, bring them sooner to their goal,  That kingdom of the law I shall not see.  We are on the verge of great discoveries.  I feel them as a dreamer feels the dawn  Before his eyes are opened. Many of you  Will see them. In that day you will recall  This, our last meeting at Uraniborg,  And how I told you that this work of ours  Would lead to victories for the coming age.  The victors may forget us. What of that?  Theirs be the palms, the shouting, and the praise.  Ours be the fathers' glory in the sons.  Ours the delight of giving, the deep joy  Of labouring, on the cliff's face, all night long,  Cutting them foot-holes in the solid rock,  Whereby they climb so gaily to the heights,  And gaze upon their new-discovered worlds.  You will not find me there. When you descend,  Look for me in the darkness at the foot  Of those high cliffs, under the drifted leaves.  That's where we hide at last, we pioneers,  For we are very proud, and must be sought  Before the world can find us, in our graves.  There have been compensations. I have seen  In darkness, more perhaps than eyes can see  When sunlight blinds them on the mountain-tops;  Guessed at a glory past our mortal range,  And only mine because the night was mine.    Of those three systems of the universe,  The Ptolemaic, held by all the schools,  May yet be proven false. We yet may find  This earth of ours is not the sovran lord  Of all those wheeling spheres. Ourselves have marked  Movements among the planets that forbid  Acceptance of it wholly. Some of these  Are moving round the sun, if we can trust  Our years of watching. There are stranger dreams.  This radical, Copernicus, the priest,  Of whom I often talked with you, declares  Ail of these movements can be reconciled,  If--a hypothesis only--we should take  The sun itself for centre, and assume  That this huge earth, so 'stablished, so secure  In its foundations, is a planet also,  And moves around the sun.                            I cannot think it.  This leap of thought is yet too great for me.  I have no doubt that Ptolemy was wrong.  Some of his planets move around the sun.  Copernicus is nearer to the truth  In some things. But the planets we have watched  Still wander from the course that he assigned.  Therefore, my system, which includes the best  Of both, I hold may yet be proven true.  This earth of ours, as Jeppe declared one day,  So simply that we laughed, is 'much too big  To move,' so let it be the centre still,  And let the planets move around their sun;  But let the sun with all its planets move  Around our central earth.                            This at the least  Accords with all we know, and saves mankind  From that enormous plunge into the night;  Saves them from voyaging for ten thousand years  Through boundless darkness without sight of land;  Saves them from all that agony of loss,  As one by one the beacon-fires of faith  Are drowned in blackness."]]]
