Horn has come--I tell you Horn is here!\"    \"Alas!\" said Athulf, \"that cannot be. Who hath brought thee such an idle  tale? Day and night have I stood here watching for him, but he came not,  and much I fear me the noble Horn is dead.\"    \"I tell you he is living,\" she said--\"aye, and more alive than ever. Go  to the forest and find him--he is there with all his faithful  followers.\"    Athulf made haste to the forest, still unbelieving, but soon his heart  bounded for joy, for there rode Horn in his shining armour at the head  of his troops. Athulf rode to his side, and they returned together to  the city, where Riminild was watching them from her turret. And Horn  pointed to her and cried to his company, \"Knights, yonder is my  bride--help me to win her!\"    Then was there a fierce storming of the gate--the shock of it shook  Riminild's tower--and Horn and his heroes burst, all unheralded, into  the King's hall. Fierce and furious was the bridal dance that followed;  the tumult of it rose up to Riminild, and she prayed, \"God preserve my  lover in this wild confusion!\"    Right merrily danced her dancer, and all unscathed he flashed through  the hall, thanks to his true love and God's care. King Aylmer and the  bridegroom confronted him and the younger, the bridegroom King, asked  him what he sought there. \"I seek my bride,\" said he, \"and if you do not  give her up to me I will have your life.\"    \"Better thou should have the bride than that,\" said the other; \"though I  would sooner be torn in pieces than give thee either.\" And he defended  himself bravely, but it availed him naught. Horn struck off his head  from his shoulders, so that it bounded across the hall. Then cried Horn  to the other guests, \"The dance is over!\" after which he proclaimed a  truce, and, throwing himself down on a couch, spake thus to King Aylmer:  \"I was born in Southland, of a royal race. The pagan Vikings slew King  Altof, my father, and put me out to sea with my twelve companions. You  did train me for the order of knighthood, and I have dishonoured it by  no unworthy deeds, though you did drive me from your kingdom, thinking I  meant to disgrace you through your daughter. But that which you credited  me with I never contemplated. Accept me then, O King, for your  son-in-law. Yet will I not claim my bride till I have won back my  kingdom of Southland. That will I accomplish quickly, with the help of  my brave knights and such others as I pray you to lend me, leaving in  pledge therefor the fairest jewel in my crown, until King Horn shall be  able to place Queen Riminild beside him on his father's throne.\"    As he spoke Riminild entered, and Horn took her hand and led her to her  father, and the young couple stood before the old King--a right royal  pair. Then King Aylmer spoke jestingly, \"Truly I once did chide a young  knight in my wrath, but never King Horn, whom I now behold for the first  time. Never would I have spoken roughly to King Horn, much less  forbidden him to woo a Princess.\"    Then all the knights and lords came offering their good wishes to the  happy pair; and the old house-steward, Athelbrus, would have bent the  knee to his former pupil, but Horn took the old man in his arms and  embraced him, thanking him for all the pains he had taken with his  breeding.    Horn's twelve companions came also, and did him homage as their  sovereign, and he rejoiced to see them all, but especially Athulf the  brave and true. \"Athulf,\" he told him, \"thou hast helped me to win my  bride here, now come with me to Southland and help me to make a home for  her. And you, too, shall win a lady--I have already chosen her; her name  is Swanhild, and she will look fair even beside Riminild.\" Then did  Athulf rejoice, but Figold, the traitor, was ready to sink into the  ground with shame and envy.    Then Horn returned to his ship, taking Athulf with him, but Figold he  left behind. Truly it is ill knowing what to do with a traitor, whether  you take him to the field or leave him at home.    On went the ship before a favouring wind; the voyage lasted but four  days. Horn landed at midnight, and he and Athulf went inland together.  On the way they came upon a noble looking knight asleep under his  shield, upon which a cross was painted, and Horn cried to him, \"Awake,  and tell us what they are doing here. Thou seemest to be a Christian, I  trow, else would I have hewn thee in pieces with my sword!\"    The good knight sprang up aghast, and said, \"Against my will I am  serving the heathen who rule here. I am keeping a place ready for Horn,  the best loved of all heroes. Long I have wondered why he does not  bestir himself to return and fight for his own. God give him power so to  do till he slay every one of these miscreants. They put him out to sea,  a tender boy, with his twelve playmates, one of whom was my only son,  Athulf. Dearly he loved Horn, and was beloved by him. Could I but see  them both once more, I should feel that I could die in peace.\"    \"Then rejoice,\" they told him, \"for Horn and Athulf are here!\"    Joyfully did the old man greet the youths; he embraced his son and bent  the knee to Horn, and all three rejoiced together.    \"Where is your company?\" asked the old knight. \"I suppose you two have  come to explore the land. Well, your mother still lives, and if she knew  you to be living would be beside herself with joy.\"    \"Blessed be the day that I and my men landed here,\" said Horn. \"We will  catch these heathen dogs, or else tame them. We will speak to them in  our own language.\"    Then Horn blew his horn, so that all on board the ship heard it and came  on shore. As the young birds long for the dawn, so Horn longed for the  fight that should free his country from her enemies. From morning to  night the battle raged, till all the heathen, young and old, were slain,  and young King Horn himself slew the pirate King. Then he went to  church, with all his people, and an anthem was sung to the glory of God,  and Horn gave thanks aloud for the restoration of his kingdom, after  which he sought the place where his mother dwelt. How his heart wept for  joy when he saw her! He placed a crown on her head, and arrayed her in  rich robes, and brought her up to the palace. \"Thou art glad to have thy  child again,\" he said to her in the joy of his heart, \"but I will make  thee gladder still by bringing thee home a daughter, one who will please  thee well.\" And he thought of his love, Riminild, with whom, however,  things were just then going very much amiss.    For as son as Horn had departed, the treacherous Figold had collected a  great army of workmen and made them build him a tower in the sea, which  could only be reached when the tide was out. Now about this time Horn  had a dream, in which he saw Riminild on board a ship at sea, which  presently went to pieces, and she tried to swim ashore, steering with  her lily-white hand, while Figold, the traitor, sought to stop her with  the point of his sword. Then he awoke and cried, \"Athulf, true friend,  we must away across the sea. Unless we make all speed some evil will  befall us.\" And in the midst of a storm they set sail.    In the meantime Figold had left his tower and appeared in the presence  of King Aylmer. Cunningly, out of his false heart spoke the traitor,  \"King Aylmer, Horn has sent me word that he would have his bride handed  over to my care. He has regained his crown and realm and would fain have  her there to be his Queen.\"    \"Very well,\" said the King, \"let her go with thee.\"    But Riminild was much displeased at the thought of being put into the  hands of Figold, whom in her soul she would not trust.    \"Why comes not Horn for me himself?\" she asked. \"I know not the way to  his kingdom either by land or by sea.\"    \"But I know it,\" said Figold, \"and I will soon bring thee thither, most  beauteous queen.\" But his wicked smile made her uneasy at heart.    \"If Horn could not come himself,\" she said, \"why did he not send Athulf,  his faithful friend?\" But this question pleased the traitor so little  that he gave her no answer.    Her father blessed her, and she set forth, wringing her white hands.    Meanwhile, Horn, sailing from the south, was driven in shore by a storm,  and he beheld Figold's high tower, and asked who had built such an ugly  thing. He thought he heard a low murmuring as his ship flew past it  before the wind, but knew not what it might be. Soon he saw the  battlements of King Aylmer's palace rising in the distance; there  Riminild should be, looking out for him, but all was bare and empty. It  seemed to him as though a star were missing from heaven; and as he  crossed the threshold the ill news was told him how Figold had carried  off Riminild. Horn had no mind to linger with the King. \"Come, Athulf,  true friend,\" said he, \"and help me to search for her.\" So they searched  far and near, in vain, till at last Horn remembered that strange tower  in the sea, and set sail for the lonely fortress where Figold had the  fair princess in his evil keeping. \"Now, my eleven companions, and you,  too, Athulf,\" said he, \"abide here while I go up alone with my horn. God  hath shown me how to order this attempt.\"    He left his sword on the ship, and took only a fishing line with a long  hook. Then round and round the tower he walked, and he blew a loud blast  out into the raging storm, until a head appeared out of a hole in the  wall of the tower--it was that wicked knave Figold's; and Horn cast his  line, and hauled the writhing traitor clean out of the tower. He whirled  round the sea wolf at the end of the line, and swung him over the water  by the sheer force of his arm, so that he was cast over to Athulf in the  ship; and sore afraid was the traitor when the true men on board seized  him.    Then Horn took up his bugle once more and sounded it so loudly that at  the first blast the door was uncovered; at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6628"],[0,"The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth (#7)"],[1,"energy, and obtain some applause. But, in general, he was stumbling  and worthless I myself remember, on three consecutive nights, hearing  him trip up and receive suppressed hisses. He lacked enterprise; other  young actors, instead of waiting to be given better parts, committed  them to memory, in the hope that their real interpreter might not come  to hand. Among these I recall John McCullough, who afterwards became  quite a celebrated actor. He was getting, if I correctly remember, only  six dollars a week, while Booth obtained eight. Yet Wilkes Booth seemed  too slow or indifferent to get on the weather side of such chances. He  still held the part of third walking gentleman, and the third is always  the first to be walked off in case of strait, as was Wilkes Booth. He  did not survive forty weeks engagement, nor make above three hundred  dollars in all that time. The Kellers arrived; they cut down the  company, and they dispensed with Wilkes Booth. He is remembered in  Philadelphia by his failure as in the world by his crime.    About this time a manager named Kunkle gave Booth a salary of twenty  dollars a week to go to the Richmond Theater. There he played a higher  order of parts, and played them better, Winning applauses from the easy  provincial cities, and taking, as everywhere the ladies by storm. I have  never wondered why many actors were strongly predisposed toward the  South. There, their social status is nine times as big as with us. The  hospitable, lounging, buzzing character of the southerner is entirely  consonant with the cosmopolitanism of the stage, and that easy  \"hang-up-your-hatativeness,\" which is the rule and the demand in  Thespianship. We place actors outside of society, and execrate them  because they are there. The South took them into affable fellowship, and  was not ruined by it, but beloved by the fraternity. Booth played two  seasons in Richmond, and left in some esteem.    When the John Brown raid occured, Booth left the Richmond Theater for  the scene of strife in a picked company with which he had affiliated for  some time. From his connection with the militia on this occasion he was  wont to trace his fealty to Virginia. He was a non-commissioned officer,  and remained at Charleston till after the execution, visiting the old  pike man in jail, and his company was selected to form guard around the  scaffold when John Brown went, white-haired, to his account. There may  be in this a consolation for the canonizers of the first arm-bearer  between the sections, that one whose unit swelled the host to crush out  that brave old life, took from the scene inspiration enough to slay a  merciful President in his unsuspecting leisure. Booth never referred to  John Brown's death in bravado; possibly at that gallows began some such  terrible purpose as he afterward consummated.    It was close upon the beginning of the war when Booth resolved to  transform himself from a stock actor to a \"star.\" As many will read this  who do not understand such distinctions, let me preface it by explaining  that a \"star\" is an actor who belongs to no one theater, but travels  from each to all, playing a few weeks at a time, and sustained in his  chief character by the regular or stock actors. A stock actor is a good  actor, and a poor fool. A star is an advertisement in tights, who grows  rich and corrupts the public taste. Booth was a star, and being so, had  an agent. The agent is a trumpeter who goes on before, writing the  impartial notices which you see in the editorial columns of country  papers and counting noses at the theater doors. Booth's agent was one  Matthew Canning, an exploded Philadelphia lawyer, who took to managing  by passing the bar, and J. Wilkes no longer, but our country's rising  tragedian. J. Wilkes Booth, opened in Montgomery, Alabama, in his  father's consecrated part of _Richard III_. It was very different work  between receiving eight dollars a week and getting half the gross  proceeds of every performance. Booth kept northward when his engagement  was done, playing in many cities such parts as _Romeo_, the _Corsican  Brothers_, and _Raphael_ in the \"_Marble Heart_;\" in all of these he  gained applause, and his journey eastward, ending in eastern cities like  Providence, Portland, and Boston was a long success, in part deserved.  In Boston he received especial commendation for his enactment of  _Richard_.    I have looked over this play, his best and favorite one, to see how  closely the career of the crookback he so often delineated resembled his  own.    How like that fearful night of _Richard_ on Bosworth field must have  been Booth's sleep in the barn at Port Royal, tortured by ghosts of  victims all repeating.        \"When I was mortal my anointed body      By thee was punched full of deadly holes:      Think on the Tower and me! Despair and die!\"    Or this, from some of Booth's female victims:        \"Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!      I that was washed to death with fulsome wine;      Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death:      To-morrow in the battle think on me; despair and die!\"    These terrible conjurations must have recalled how aptly the scene as  often rehearsed by Booth, sword in hand, where, leaping from his bed, he  cries in horror:        \"Give me another horse! bind up my wounds!      Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.      Oh! coward conscience how thou dost afflict me!      The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight!      Cold, flareful drops stand on my trembling flesh.      What do I fear? Myself! there is none else by:      Is there a murderer here? No!--Yes!--I am!      Then fly,--what from myself?                  *       *       *       *       *        My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,      And every tongue brings in a several tale.      And every tale condemns me for a villain!      Perjury, perjury in the highest degree:      Murder, stern murder in the direst degree:      All several sins, all used in each degree.      Throng to the bar, crying all, _Guilty! guilty!_\"    By these starring engagments, Booth made incredible sums. His cashbook,  for one single season, showed earnings deposited in bank of twenty-two  odd thousand dollars. In New York he did not get a hearing, except at a  benefit or two: where he played parts not of his selection. In  Philadelphia his earlier failure predisposed the people to discard him,  and they did. But he had made enough, and resolved to invest his  winnings, The oil fever had just begun; he hired an agent, sent him to  the western districts and gave him discretionary power; his investments  all turned out profitable.    Booth died, as far as understood without debts. The day before the  murder he paid an old friend a hundred dollars which he had borrowed two  days previously. He banked at Jay Cook's in Washington, generally; but  turned most of his funds into stock and other matters. He gave eighty  dollars eight month's ago for a part investing with others in a piece of  western oil land. The certificate for this land he gave to his sister.  Just before he died his agent informed him that the share was worth  fifteen thousand dollars. Booth kept his accounts latterly with great  regularity, and was lavish as ever, but took note of all expenditures,  however irregular. He was one of those men whom the possession of money  seems to have energized; his life, so purposeless long before, grew by  good fortune to a strict computation with the world. Yet what availed so  sudden reformation, and of what use was the gaining of wealth, to throw  one's life so soon away, and leap from competence to hunted infamy.    The beauty of this man and his easy confidentiality, not familiar, but  marked by a mild and even dignity, made many women impassioned of him.  He was licentious as men, and particularly as actors go, but not a  seducer, so far as I can learn. I have traced one case in Philadelphia  where a young girl who had seen him on the stage became enamored of him.    She sent him bouquets, notes, photographs and all the accessories of an  intrigue. Booth, to whom such things were common, yielded to the girl's  importunities at last and gave her an interview. He was surprised to  find that so bold a correspondent was so young, so fresh, and so  beautiful. He told her therefore, in pity, the consequences of pursuing  him; that he entertained no affection for her, though a sufficient  desire, and that he was a man of the world to whom all women grew  fulsome in their turn.    \"Go home,\" he said, \"and beware of actors. They are to be seen, not to  be known.\"    The girl, yet more infatuated, persisted. Booth, who had no real virtue  except by scintillations, became what he had promised, and one more soul  went to the isles of Cyprus.    In Montgomery, if I do not mistake, Booth met the woman from whom he  received a stab which he carried all the rest of his days. She was an  actress, and he visited her. They assumed a relation creditable only in  _La Boheme_, and were as tender as love without esteem can ever be. But,  after a time, Booth wearied of her and offered to say \"good by.\" She  refused--he treated her coldly; she pleaded--he passed her by.    Then, with a jealous woman's frenzy, she drew a knife upon him and  stabbed him in the neck, with the intent to kill him. Being muscular, he  quickly disarmed her, though he afterward suffered from the wound  poignantly.    Does it not bring a blush to our faces that a good, great man, like he  who has died--our President--should have met his fate from one so inured  to a life of ribaldry? Yet, only such an one could have been found to  murder Abraham Lincoln.    The women persecuted Booth more than he followed them. He was waylaid by  married women in every provincial town or city where he played. His face  was so youthful, yet so manly, and his movements so graceful and  excellent, that other than the coarse and errant"]]]
