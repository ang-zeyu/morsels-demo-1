There is no property in patents,\"  I often hear said. And how about the invention covered by a patent? Is  that property? A large majority of people may say no, and deny the  justice of a patent law. On the contrary, I, as an inventor, think an  invention is genuine property, and as such should be under the same  protection in common law as all other property, instead of requiring a  special law by which the people magnanimously grant me the privilege for  a short time of using what was never theirs, what they never knew of  until I brought it into existence.    But what is real property, and by what title is it held? Mother earth,  from which we sprung, by which we exist, and to which we return, is,  without question, real estate. How is it obtained; how held? History  answers, By conquest, by subjugation. But these words, conquest and  subjugation, have a more significant meaning than the spoiling of one  people by another; they are the actual price of possession. He who,  toiling, subjugates the soil, is undoubted owner of its production, by  virtue of the highest blessing on record--\"By the sweat of thy brow  shalt thou obtain bread.\" And this principle is so far acknowledged that  the laborer holds a lien on the product of his labor, even though the  property belongs to another.    Mr. A has an unpromising piece of land on which he would like to raise  corn. He analyzes the soil, experiments upon it chemically, reads up on  the properties and components of corn, the effects of fertilizers and  acids upon the soil, and makes himself a fool and laughing-stock  generally among his neighbors because he steps out of the beaten track  by which they have succeeded in making the ground barren. He does not  have much success the first year, and is sympathizingly consoled with \"I  told you so.\" But he perseveres and wins the reputation of being  \"visionary\" and \"as stubborn as a mule.\" In the meantime he becomes more  familiar with his subject, sees more clearly the requirements of the  case, finds he must post himself more thoroughly in certain branches of  science in order to conduct his experiments, wrestles with this obstacle  and that, and finally discovers a fertilizer based on some natural law  of rotation, and produces a crop of corn never before equaled. Now his  neighbors come out with this very intelligent question, \"How did you  happen to think of it?\" And they further very condescendingly remark,  \"That is a rousing crop; I guess I'll try the same thing myself. How did  you say you mixed the stuff?\" This man is the true conqueror. He has  endured privation and scorn, fought obstacles, and in subduing them has  eliminated a new principle in agriculture that is an engine of power to  all generations. Shall his crops be his only reward? Shall they who  laughed him to scorn step into his reward without sharing the labor that  produced it?    This is a simile for thousands of inventions, only that the inventor is  seldom situated to plant the corn on his own land and reap the harvest.  Then which of you will say that he has not a just lien on every man's  crop raised by his process for a per cent of the gains thereby? There is  a bill before Congress favoring a periodical taxation of patents under  the pretext of removing useless patents from the path of later  inventors. Let me show you how one inventor looks at that. My neighbor  has a vacant lot on which he is unable to build; but joined to mine it  would increase the value of my property vastly. Now can't you legislate  that old heap of rubbish into my possession somehow? Of course he is  waiting for the rise of property around him to sell his lot well; but  can't you make that appear unnatural, and that he is a dog in the  manger? It is also said that sharpers get control of old patents and lay  an embargo on legitimate business. I reply, first, no one could be  damaged by the owner of a patent unless he infringed that owner's right;  second, if he does infringe, it shows that said patent is valuable,  otherwise he need not infringe; and if valuable why should not he pay  for it? Mr. B, in the employ of Mr. C, watches the machine he uses, and  spends his leisure hours in working out an improvement, which he patents  and offers to C for sale; but as the invention is useless except as  attached to C's machine, he thinks B can't help himself, and adopts the  improvement without paying for it. When a few years have built up a  great industry, and C is rich from his spoils, B steps in with a few  friends at his back, incorporated especially to make C shell out.    Of course this is bad and ought to be legislated against. If it were not  valuable C need not use it. It is not becoming to the Congress of a  great nation to spend its time in legislating worthless patents out of  existence. All such will die a natural death. And if there is sufficient  worth in any patent to claim your consideration, the inventor is  entitled to its price, whether he waits four years or fifteen for his  pay.    I speak of myself, not as an individual, but as representing in this  letter a class, without whose achievements America, in her proud length  and breadth, could not to-day have been. For the last half of my past  life, over twenty years, I have been an inventor. Schooled in adversity,  accustomed to disappointment, sometimes successful, enjoying no  luxuries but the conquest of obstacles, and often forced to simple  pursuits to keep the pot boiling, yet I expect to spend the rest of my  life inventing, feeling strong in the school of experience, and hoping  for such prosperity as will enable me to work out some of the larger  problems in view.    If those in power would really aid the inventor, let them increase his  facilities for information. Circulate the Patent Office _Gazette_ at one  dollar a year, a nominal subscription to insure _bona fide_ readers, and  pay the balance out of the Patent Office surplus now accumulated. This  both to educate and to save inventors from going over old ground,  bringing more talent up to the standard of to-day. Lessen rather than  increase Patent Office fees. Enable the Commissioner to give the  strictest possible examination on every application for a patent, that  when issued it shall bear a _bona fide_ value, by retaining the most  competent examiners at a salary adequate to keep them. Reduce the  cumbrous machinery of patent litigation to about this text, in two  headings: First, Is plaintiff the first inventor? Allow one month to  find that out. If not disproved in that time, allow it. Second, Does  defendant infringe? Allow one month to decide that. If not proven,  discharge the case, with cost to plaintiff. If proved, cost and damage  to be settled by defendant in thirty days.    The ability of wealthy corporations to absorb with impunity the product  of all talent within their reach, and put off the day of reckoning until  plaintiff is swallowed in cost, is the greatest present discouragement  to inventors. Our patent law is now better than any amendment yet  proposed will leave it. If you must tinker over it, remember all laws  are for protection of the weak. The bulldog does not need law to take  the bone from the spaniel. Just in proportion as you damage the patent  law, you destroy the accomplishments and purpose of my life. Therefore I  have spoken; so could a thousand more.                 W. X. STEVENS.

I can find none whatever; the microphone in its numerous forms that I  have already made, and varied by many others since, is simply the  embodiment of a discovery I have made, in which I consider the  microphone as the first step to new and perhaps more wonderful  applications.    I have proved that all bodies, solid, liquid, and gaseous, are in a  state of molecular agitation when under the influence of sonorous  vibrations; no matter if it is a piece of board, walls of a house,  street, fields or woods, sea or air, all are in this constant state of  vibration, which simply becomes more evident as the sonorous vibrations  are more powerful. This I have proved by the discovery that when two or  more electrical conducting bodies are placed in contact under very  slight constant pressure, resting on any body whatever, they will of  themselves transform a constant electrical current into an undulatory  current, representing in its exact form the vibrations of the matter on  which it reposes; it requires no complicated arrangement and no special  material, and to most experimenters the three simple iron nails that I  have described form the best and most sensitive microphone. But these  contact points would soon oxidize, so naturally I prefer some conducting  material which will not oxidize.    Mr. Edison's carbon telephone represents the principle of the varying  pressure of a diaphragm or its equivalent on a button of carbon varying  the amount of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43289"],[0,"HÃ¤nsel and Gretel: A Fairy Opera in Three Acts (#7)"],[1,"dear,      d'you take me for a fool?

He's had his fill,          to say the least!    FATHER.        Well, yes! H'm! it was a lovely day,      don't you think so, dear wife?    (_Wants to kiss her._)    MOTHER    (_pushing him angrily away, excitedly_).        Have done! You have no troubles to bear,      'tis I must keep the house!    FATHER.        Well, well,--then let us see, my dear,      what we have got to eat to-day.    MOTHER.        Most simple is the bill of fare,      our supper's gone, I know not where!      Larder bare, cellar bare,      nothing, and plenty of it to spare!    FATHER.              Tralalala, tralalala!      Cheer up, mother, for here am I,      bringing luck and jollity!    (_He takes his basket and begins to display he contents._)        Look, mother, doesn't all this food please you?    MOTHER.        Man, man, what see I?      Ham and butter,      flour and sausage--      eggs, a dozen....      (Husband, and they cost a fortune!)      Turnips, onions, and--for me!      Nearly half a pound of tea!    BOTH.            Tralala, tralala,          hip hurrah!          Won't we have a festive time!          Tralala, hip hurrah!          Won't we have a happy time!      Now listen how it all came about!    FATHER    (_turns the basket topsy-turvy, and a lot of potatoes roll out. He  seizes her by the arm and dances round the room. Sits down. Meanwhile  the mother packs away the things, lights a fire, breaks eggs into a  saucepan, etc._).        Yonder to the town I went,      there was to be a great event,      weddings, fairs, and preparation      for all kinds of jubilation!      Now's my chance to do some selling,      and for that you may be thankful!      He who wants a feast to keep,      he must scrub and brush and sweep.      So I brought my best goods out,      tramped with them from house to house:      \"Buy besoms! good besoms!      Buy my brushes! sweep your carpets,      sweep your cobwebs!\"      And so I drove a roaring trade,      and sold my brushes at the highest prices!      Now make haste with cup and platter,      bring the glasses, bring the kettle--      here's a health to the besom-maker!    MOTHER.        Here's a health to the besom-maker!    FATHER.        But stay, why, where are the children?      Haensel, Gretel, what's gone with Hans?    MOTHER.        Gone with Hans? O, who's to know?      But at least I do know this,      that the jug is smashed to bits.    FATHER.        What! the jug is smashed to bits?    MOTHER.        And the cream all run away.    FATHER    (_striking his fist on the table in a rage_).        Hang it all! So those little scapegraces      have been again in mischief!    MOTHER (_hastily_).        Been in mischief? I should think so!      Nought have they done but their mad pranking;      as I came home I could hear them      hopping and cutting the wildest capers,      till I was so cross that I gave a push--      and the jug of milk was spilt!    FATHER.        And the jug of milk was spilt!      Ha ha ha ha!    (_Both laughing._)        Such anger, mother, don't take it ill,      seems stupid to me, I must say!      But where, where think you the children can be?    MOTHER (_snappishly and curtly_).        For aught I know, at the Ilsenstein!    FATHER (_horror-struck_).        The Ilsenstein! Come, come, have a care!    (_Fetches a broom from the wall._)    MOTHER.        The besom, just put it away again!    FATHER    (_lets the broom fall and wrings his hands_).        My children astray in the gloomy wood,      all alone without moon or stars!    MOTHER.        O Heaven!    FATHER.        Dost thou not know the awful magic place,      the place where the evil one dwells?    MOTHER (_surprised_).        The evil one! What mean'st thou?    FATHER (_with mysterious emphasis_).        The gobbling ogress!    (_The mother draws back, the father takes up the broom again._)    MOTHER.        The gobbling ogress!      But--tell me, what help is the besom!    FATHER.        The besom, the besom, why what is it for?      They ride on it, they ride on it, the witches!      An old witch within that wood doth dwell      and she's in league with the powers of hell.      At midnight hour, when nobody knows,      away to the witches' dance she goes.          Up the chimney they fly,          on a broomstick they hie--          over hill and dale,          o'er ravine and vale,          through the midnight air          they gallop full tear--          on a broomstick, on a broomstick,          hop hop, hop hop, the witches!    MOTHER.        O horror!      But the gobbling witch?    FATHER.
