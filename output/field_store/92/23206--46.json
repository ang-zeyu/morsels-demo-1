This is no time to dance.  Well, a man that is packed away like  that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of  the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.    The boys helped me, or I never could have got in.  Just as we  finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not  I hadn't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.  How  stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand.  He had on his  head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and  for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his  upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from  neck to heel, was flexible chain mail, trousers and all.  But  pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which  of course was of chain mail, as I said, and hung straight from his  shoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to the bottom, both  before and behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the  skirts hang down on each side.  He was going grailing, and it was  just the outfit for it, too.  I would have given a good deal for  that ulster, but it was too late now to be fooling around.  The sun  was just up, the king and the court were all on hand to see me off  and wish me luck; so it wouldn't be etiquette for me to tarry.  You don't get on your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you  would get disappointed.  They carry you out, just as they carry  a sun-struck man to the drug store, and put you on, and help get  you to rights, and fix your feet in the stirrups; and all the while  you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else--like  somebody that has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning,  or something like that, and hasn't quite fetched around yet, and  is sort of numb, and can't just get his bearings.  Then they  stood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left  foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield  around my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor  and get to sea.  Everybody was as good to me as they could be,  and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.  There was  nothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me on  a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on.    And so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their  handkerchiefs or helmets.  And everybody we met, going down the hill  and through the village was respectful to us, except some shabby  little boys on the outskirts.  They said:    \"Oh, what a guy!\"  And hove clods at us.    In my experience boys are the same in all ages.  They don't respect  anything, they don't care for anything or anybody.  They say  \"Go up, baldhead\" to the prophet going his unoffending way in  the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the  Middle Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan's  administration; I remember, because I was there and helped.  The  prophet had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted  to get down and settle with mine, but it wouldn't answer, because  I couldn't have got up again.  I hate a country without a derrick."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7244"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 3. (#7)"],[1," been aging me with.  But Morgan was the main attraction, the  conspicuous personality here; she was head chief of this household,  that was plain.  She caused us to be seated, and then she began,  with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses, to ask me  questions.  Dear me, it was like a bird or a flute, or something,  talking.  I felt persuaded that this woman must have been  misrepresented, lied about.  She trilled along, and trilled along,  and presently a handsome young page, clothed like the rainbow, and  as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave, came with something  on a golden salver, and, kneeling to present it to her, overdid  his graces and lost his balance, and so fell lightly against her  knee.  She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-of-course a way as  another person would have harpooned a rat!    Poor child! he slumped to the floor, twisted his silken limbs in  one great straining contortion of pain, and was dead.  Out of the  old king was wrung an involuntary \"O-h!\" of compassion.  The look  he got, made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens  in it.  Sir Uwaine, at a sign from his mother, went to the anteroom  and called some servants, and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly  along with her talk.    I saw that she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she  kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made  no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came  with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and  when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated  a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had  overlooked.  It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed  to see the mistress of the house.  Often, how louder and clearer  than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak.    Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever.  Marvelous woman.  And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those  servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the  lightning flashes out of a cloud.  I could have got the habit  myself.  It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he was  always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn  toward him but he winced.    In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about  King Arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her  brother.  That one little compliment was enough.  She clouded up  like storm; she called for her guards, and said:    \"Hale me these varlets to the dungeons.\"    That struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation.  Nothing occurred to me to say--or do.  But not so with Sandy.  As the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest  confidence, and said:    \"God's wounds, dost thou covet destruction, thou maniac?  It is  The Boss!\"    Now what a happy idea that was!--and so simple; yet it would never  have occurred to me.  I was born modest; not all over, but in spots;  and this was one of the spots.    The effect upon madame was electrical.  It cleared her countenance  and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and  blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up  with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright. She said:    \"La, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers  like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who  has vanquished Merlin, and not be jesting.  By mine enchantments  I foresaw your coming, and by them I knew you when you entered  here.  I did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you  into some display of your art, as not doubting you would blast  the guards with occult fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot,  a marvel much beyond mine own ability, yet one which I have long  been childishly curious to see.\"    The guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got permission."]]]
