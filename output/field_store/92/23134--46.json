Algiers'   efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the   Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged   the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched   a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic   stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.   Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992   the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political   turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one   priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural   adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and   burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year   standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994.

For miles and miles and miles summer ripens no crops, leads  out no maidens laughing in the moonlight, and brings no harvest home.  When Autumn looks on orchards in all that region of mourning he looks  upon barren trees that will never blossom again. Winter drives in no  sturdy farmers at evening to sit before cheery fires, families meet  not at Christmas, and the bells are dumb in belfries; for all by which  a man might remember his home has been utterly swept away: has been  swept away to make a maniacal dancing ground on which a murderous  people dance to their death led by a shallow, clever, callous,  imperial clown.    There they dance to their doom till their feet shall find the  precipice that was prepared for them on the day that they planned the  evil things they have done.          The Nightmare Countries      There are certain lands in the darker dreams of poetry that stand out  in the memory of generations. There is for instance Poe's \"Dark tarn  of Auber, the ghoul-haunted region of Weir\"; there are some queer  twists in the river Alph as imagined by Coleridge; two lines of  Swinburne:         By the tideless dolorous inland sea       In a land of sand and ruin and gold    are as haunting as any. There are in literature certain regions of  gloom, so splendid that whenever you come on them they leave in the  mind a sort of nightmare country which one's thoughts revisit on  hearing the lines quoted.    It is pleasant to picture such countries sometimes when sitting before  the fire. It is pleasant because you can banish them by the closing of  a book; a puff of smoke from a pipe will hide them altogether, and  back come the pleasant, wholesome, familiar things. But in France they  are there always. In France the nightmare countries stand all night in  the starlight; dawn comes and they still are there. The dead are  buried out of sight and others take their places among men; but the  lost lands lie unburied gazing up at the winds; and the lost woods  stand like skeletons all grotesque in the solitude; the very seasons  have fled from them. The very seasons have fled; so that if you look  up to see whether summer has turned to autumn, or if autumn has turned  to winter yet, nothing remains to show you. It is like the eccentric  dream of some strange man, very arresting and mysterious, but lacking  certain things that should be there before you can recognize it as  earthly. It is a mad, mad landscape. There are miles and miles and  miles of it. It is the biggest thing man has done. It looks as though  man in his pride, with all his clever inventions, had made for himself  a sorry attempt at creation.    Indeed when we trace it all back to its origin we find at the  beginning of this unhappy story a man who was only an emperor and  wished to be something more. He would have ruled the world but has  only meddled with it; and his folly has brought misery to millions,  and there lies his broken dream on the broken earth. He will never  take Paris now. He will never be crowned at Versailles as Emperor of  Europe; and after that, most secret dream of all, did not the Caesars  proclaim themselves divine? Was it not whispered among Macedonian  courtiers that Alexander was the child of God? And was the  Hohenzollern less than these?    What might not force accomplish? All gone now, that dream and the  Hohenzollern line broken. A maniacal dream and broken farms all mixed  up together: they make a pretty nightmare and the clouds still gleam  at night with the flashes of shells, and the sky is still troubled by  day with uncouth balloons and the black bursts of the German shells  and the white of our anti-aircraft.    And below there lies this wonderful waste land where no girls sing,  and where no birds come but starlings; where no hedgerows stand, and  no lanes with wild roses, and where no pathways run through fields of  wheat, and there are no fields at all and no farms and no farmers; and  two haystacks stand on a hill I know, undestroyed in the desolation,  and nobody touches them for they know the Germans too well; and the  tops have been blown off hills down to the chalk. And men say of this  place that it is Pozieres and of that place that it is Ginchy; nothing  remains to show that hamlets stood there at all, and a brown, brown  weed grows over it all for ever; and a mighty spirit has arisen in  man, and no one bows to the War Lord though many die. And Liberty is  she who sang her songs of old, and is fair as she ever was, when men  see her in visions, at night in No Man's Land when they have the  strength to crawl in: still she walks of a night in Pozieres and in  Ginchy.    A fanciful man once called himself the Emperor of the Sahara: the  German Kaiser has stolen into a fair land and holds with weakening  hands a land of craters and weed, and wire and wild cabbages and old  German bones.          Spring and the Kaiser      While all the world is waiting for Spring there lie great spaces in  one of the pleasantest lands to which Spring cannot come.    Pear trees and cherry and orchards flash over other lands, blossoming  as abundantly as though their wonder were new, with a beauty as fresh  and surprising as though nothing like it before had ever adorned  countless centuries. Now with the larch and soon with the beech trees  and hazel, a bright green blazes forth to illumine the year. The  slopes are covered with violets. Those who have gardens are beginning  to be proud of them and to point them out to their neighbours. Almond  and peach in blossom peep over old brick walls. The land dreams of  summer all in the youth of the year.    But better than all this the Germans have found war. The simple  content of a people at peace in pleasant countries counted for nothing  with them. Their Kaiser prepared for war, made speeches about war,  and, when he was ready, made war. And now the hills that should be  covered with violets are full of murderous holes, and the holes are  half full of empty meat tins, and the garden walls have gone and the  gardens with them, and there are no woods left to shelter anemones.  Boundless masses of brown barbed wire straggle over the landscape. All  the orchards there are cut down out of ruthless spite to hurt France  whom they cannot conquer. All the little trees that grow near gardens  are gone, aspen, laburnum and lilac. It is like this for hundreds of  miles. Hundreds of ruined towns gaze at it with vacant windows and see  a land from which even Spring is banished. And not a ruined house in  all the hundred towns but mourns for some one, man, woman or child;  for the Germans make war equally on all in the land where Spring comes  no more.    Some day Spring will come back; some day she will shine all April in  Picardy again, for Nature is never driven utterly forth, but comes  back with her seasons to cover up even the vilest things.    She shall hide the raw earth of the shell holes till the violets come  again; she shall bring back even the orchards for Spring to walk in  once more; the woods will grow tall again above the southern anemones;  and the great abandoned guns of the Germans will rust by the rivers of  France. Forgotten like them, the memory of the War Lord will pass with  his evil deeds.          Two Songs      Over slopes of English hills looking south in the time of violets,  evening was falling.    Shadows at edges of woods moved, and then merged in the gloaming.    The bat, like a shadow himself, finding that spring was come, slipped  from the dark of the wood as far as a clump of beech trees and  fluttered back again on his wonderful quiet wings.    Pairing pigeons were home.    Very young rabbits stole out to gaze at the calm still world. They  came out as the stars come. At one time they were not there, and then  you saw them, but you did not see them come.    Towering clouds to the west built palaces, cities and mountains;  bastions of rose and precipices of gold; giants went home over them  draped in mauve by steep rose-pink ravines into emerald-green empires.  Turbulences of colour broke out above the departed sun; giants merged  into mountains, and cities became seas, and new processions of other  fantastic things sailed by. But the chalk slopes facing south smiled  on with the same calm light, as though every blade of grass gathered a  ray from the gloaming. All the hills faced the evening with that same  quiet glow, which faded softly as the air grew colder; and the first  star appeared.    Voices came up in the hush, clear from the valley, and ceased. A light  was lit, like a spark, in a distant window: more stars appeared and  the woods were all dark now, and shapes even on the hill slopes began  to grow indistinct.    Home by a laneway in the dim, still evening a girl was going, singing  the Marseillaise.    In France where the downs in the north roll away without hedges, as  though they were great free giants that man had never confined, as  though they were stretching their vast free limbs in the evening, the  same light was smiling and glimmering softly away.    A road wound over the downs and away round one of their shoulders. A  hush lay over them as though the giants slept, or as though they  guarded in silence their ancient, wonderful history.    The stillness deepened and the dimness of twilight; and just before  colours fade, while shapes can still be distinguished, there came by  the road a farmer leading his Norman horse. High over the horse's  withers his collar pointed with brass made him fantastic and huge and  strange to see in the evening.    They moved together through that mellow light towards where unseen  among the clustered downs the old French farmer's house was sheltered  away.    He was going home at evening humming \"God Save the King.\"          The"]]]
