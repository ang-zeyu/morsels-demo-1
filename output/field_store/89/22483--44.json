[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#7)"],[1," word,\" said Garnet, \"as  far as variety is concerned.\"    The man with the manners of a marquis seemed to have been at great  pains to send a really representative supply of fowls. There were blue  ones, black ones, white, gray, yellow, brown, big, little, Dorkings,  Minorcas, Cochin Chinas, Bantams, Orpingtons, Wyandottes, and a host  more. It was an imposing spectacle.    The hired man returned toward the end of the morning, preceded by a  cart containing the necessary wire and boxes, and Ukridge, whose  enthusiasm brooked no delay, started immediately the task of  fashioning the coops, while Garnet, assisted by Beale, draped the wire  netting about the chosen spot next to the paddock. There were little  unpleasantnesses--once a roar of anguish told that Ukridge's hammer  had found the wrong billet, and on another occasion Garnet's flannel  trousers suffered on the wire--but the work proceeded steadily. By the  middle of the afternoon things were in a sufficiently advanced state  to suggest to Ukridge the advisability of a halt for refreshments.    \"That's the way to do it,\" said he. \"At this rate we shall have the  place in A1 condition before bedtime. What do you think of those for  coops, Beale?\"    The hired man examined them gravely.    \"I've seen worse, sir.\"    He continued his examination.    \"But not many,\" he added. Beale's passion for truth had made him  unpopular in three regiments.    \"They aren't so bad,\" said Garnet, \"but I'm glad I'm not a fowl.\"    \"So you ought to be,\" said Ukridge, \"considering the way you've put up  that wire. You'll have them strangling themselves.\"    In spite of earnest labor, the housing arrangements of the fowls were  still in an incomplete state at the end of the day. The details of the  evening's work are preserved in a letter which Garnet wrote that  night to his friend Lickford.           *       *       *       *       *    \"... Have you ever played a game called 'Pigs in Clover'? We have just  finished a bout of it (with hens instead of marbles) which has lasted  for an hour and a half. We are all dead tired except the hired man,  who seems to be made of India rubber. He has just gone for a stroll to  the beach. Wants some exercise, I suppose. Personally, I feel as if I  should never move again. I have run faster and farther than I have  done since I was at school. You have no conception of the difficulty  of rounding up fowls and getting them safely to bed. Having no proper  place to put them, we were obliged to stow some of them inside soap  boxes and the rest in the basement. It has only just occurred to me  that they ought to have had perches to roost on. It didn't strike me  before. I shall not mention it to Ukridge, or that indomitable man  will start making some, and drag me into it, too. After all, a hen can  rough it for one night, and if I did a stroke more work I should  collapse. My idea was to do the thing on the slow but sure principle.  That is to say, take each bird singly and carry it to bed. It would  have taken some time, but there would have been no confusion. But you  can imagine that that sort of thing would not appeal to Ukridge. There  is a touch of the Napoleon about him. He likes his maneuvers to be  daring and on a large scale. He said: 'Open the yard gate and let the  fowls come out into the open, then sail in and drive them in a mass  through the back door into the basement.' It was a great idea, but  there was one fatal flaw in it. It didn't allow for the hens  scattering. We opened the gate, and out they all came like an audience  coming out of a theater. Then we closed in on them to bring off the  big drive. For about three seconds it looked as if we might do it.  Then Bob, the hired man's dog, an animal who likes to be in whatever's  going on, rushed out of the house into the middle of them, barking.  There was a perfect stampede, and Heaven only knows where some of  those fowls are now. There was one in particular, a large yellow bird,  which, I should imagine, is nearing London by this time. The last I  saw of it, it was navigating at the rate of knots, so to speak, in  that direction, with Bob after it barking his hardest. Presently Bob  came back, panting, having evidently given up the job. We, in the  meantime, were chasing the rest of the birds all over the garden. The  thing had now resolved itself into the course of action I had  suggested originally, except that instead of collecting them quietly  and at our leisure, we had to run miles for each one we captured.  After a time we introduced some sort of system into it. Mrs. Ukridge  (fancy him married; did you know?) stood at the door. We chased the  hens and brought them in. Then as we put each through into the  basement, she shut the door on it. We also arranged Ukridge's soap-box  coops in a row, and when we caught a fowl we put it into the coop and  stuck a board in front of it. By these strenuous means we gathered in  about two thirds of the lot. The rest are all over England. A few may  be in Dorsetshire, but I should not like to bet on it.    \"So you see things are being managed on the up-to-date chicken farm on  good, sound, Ukridge principles. This is only the beginning. I look  with confidence for further exciting events. I believe, if Ukridge  kept white mice, he would manage to knock some feverish excitement out  of it. He is at present lying on the sofa, smoking one of his infernal  brand of cigars. From the basement I can hear faintly the murmur of  innumerable fowls. We are a happy family; we are, we _are_, we ARE!    \"P. S. Have you ever caught a fowl and carried it to roost? You take  it under the wings, and the feel of it sets one's teeth on edge. It is  a grisly experience. All the time you are carrying it, it makes faint  protesting noises and struggles feebly to escape.    \"P. P. S. You know the opinion of Pythagoras respecting fowls. That  'the soul of our granddam might haply inhabit a bird.' I hope that  yellow hen which Bob chased into the purple night is not the  grandmamma of any friend of mine.\"          A REUNION    VI      The day was Thursday, the date July the twenty-second. We had been  chicken farmers for a whole week, and things were beginning to settle  down to a certain extent. The coops were finished. They were not  masterpieces, and I have seen chickens pause before them in deep  thought, as who should say: \"Now what in the world have we struck  here?\" But they were coops, within the meaning of the act, and we  induced the hens to become tenants. The hardest work had been the  fixing of the wire netting. This was the department of the hired man  and myself. Beale and I worked ourselves into a fever in the sun,  while the senior partner of the firm sat in the house, writing out  plans and ideas and scribbling down his accounts (which must have been  complicated) on gilt-edged correspondence cards. From time to time he  abused his creditors, who were numerous.    Ukridge's financial methods were always puzzling to the ordinary mind.  We had hardly been at the farm a day before he began to order in a  vast supply of necessary and unnecessary articles--all on credit. Some  he got from the village, others from neighboring towns. He has a way  with him, like Father O'Flynn, and the tradesmen behaved beautifully.  The things began to pour in from all sides--suits, groceries (of the  very best), a piano, a gramophone, and pictures of all kinds. He was  not one of those men who want but little here below. He wanted a great  deal, and of a superior quality. If a tradesman suggested that a small  check on account would not be taken amiss, as one or two sordid  fellows of the village did, he became pathetic.    \"Confound it, sir,\" he would say with tears in his voice, laying a  hand on the man's shoulder in an elder brotherly way, \"it's a trifle  hard when a gentleman comes to settle here, that you should dun him  for things before he has settled the preliminary expenses about his  house.\"    This sounded well, and suggested the disbursement of huge sums for  rent. The fact that the house had been lent him rent free was kept  with some care in the background. Having weakened the man with pathos,  he would strike a sterner note. \"A little more of this,\" he would go  on, \"and I'll close my account. As it is, I think I will remove my  patronage to a firm which will treat me civilly. Why, sir, I've never  heard anything like it in all my experience.\" Upon which the man  would knuckle under and go away forgiven, with a large order for more  goods.    Once, when Ukridge and I were alone, I ventured to expostulate. High  finance was always beyond my mental grasp. \"Pay?\" he exclaimed, \"of  course we shall pay. You don't seem to realize the possibilities of  this business. Garny, my boy, we are on to a big thing. The money  isn't coming in yet. We must give it time. But soon we shall be  turning over hundreds every week. I am in touch with Whiteley's and  Harrod's and all the big places. Perfectly simple business matter.  Here I am, I said, with a large chicken farm with all the modern  improvements. You want eggs, I said. I supply them. I will let you  have so many hundred eggs a week, I said; what will you give for them?  Well, their terms did not come up to my scheduled prices, I admit, but  we mustn't sneer at small prices at first.\"    The upshot of it was that the firms mentioned supplied us with a  quantity of goods, agreeing to receive phantom eggs in exchange. This  satisfied Ukridge. He had a faith in the laying powers of his hens  which would have flattered those birds if they could have known of it.  It might also have stimulated their efforts in that direction, which  up to date were feeble. This, however, I attributed to the fact that  the majority of our fowls--perhaps through some sinister practical  joke on the part of the manager who had the manners of a marquis--were  cocks. It vexed Ukridge. \"Here we are,\" he said complainingly, \"l"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#7)"],[1,"sides and tiny featherless bodies.  Soon the pin-feathers appeared.    \"See!\" cried the watchers, \"now the beautiful plumage is starting!\"    And those by the riverside, hearing the cry, looked up, and looking up  they sighed.  The red-brown eggs also were cracking open and the young  birds coming out of the shells.  Soon the earth children must follow  their bird leaders.  They fed and tended the young birds for still a  few days.    Then one morning there were sighs and discontent on the cliff.  For the  birds which came from the blue shells were feathered and ready for  flight.  Their colours were black and white!  So also is all the bare  earth and the new-fallen snow!    It was a pair of ravens, which the stronger earth children followed to  the country where winter follows summer and where men work for food.  As the earth children laboured, the ravens taunted them with hoarse,  laughing cries.    Now those other earth children who watched the red-brown eggs stood up  by the riverside and smiled.    From the red-brown eggs had come birds of gorgeous plumage.  On the  breath of a sweet-scented breeze they were wafted far to southward--to  the summer land.  And those earth children who followed the beautiful  birds still live easily in the land of everlasting summer-time.          ALL ABOUT THE CHICKEN-HAWK    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Voice--sharp, harsh, discordant cries--queer \"whistling\" noises.    Upper parts brownish black mixed with white--throat and under tail  coverts white--other under parts having darker markings.    Bill--short, curved, and very sharp.    Claws--strong, curved, and very sharp,--middle toe longest.    Wings--long and pointed--made for rapid flight and long journeys.    Female larger than male.    Food--other smaller birds of the air--small ducks and  chickens--occasionally larger insects, snakes, etc.    Nest in the fork of a tree--made of crooked sticks and lined with  leaves, bark, etc.    Eggs--two to four in number, bluish white, thickly speckled with brown.    Iris in young bird's eyes yellow--turning to reddish brown with  maturity.          ALL ABOUT THE RAVEN    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Three times the size of robin.    Does not migrate, but is usually resident in the place where it can  best provide for itself and family.    Is glossy black in colour, with gleams of purple and green  above--duller underneath.    Flies in wide circles high above the tree-tops, and utters a weird,  uncanny cry, which has given it the name of being a bird of ill omen,  and to many people the cry of the raven is deemed a sign of approaching  evil.    Nest very compactly built of sticks and grasses and lined with wool  from sheep's back.  Nest is used year after year, being often relined  and made habitable.    Young when first hatched are black and white--they however change to  entire black in a very short time.    Food of the raven is varied, apparently anything edible which comes in  his way--grain, seeds, grubs, worms, field-mice, fruit, are found on  his menu.          THE KINGFISHER    OR HALCYON BIRD      WITH THE WATER WATCHMAN    \"Please, Jack,\" begged Phyllis.    \"Girls always talk,\" replied Jack.    \"I will not say a word to you--indeed I will not.\"    \"Well, if you spoil my fishing--\" began Jack.    \"And I'll pick thimbleberries for our lunch,\" said Phyllis, eagerly.    So it happened that a small girl in a great sunbonnet followed a small  boy with a still larger straw hat and a fishing-pole and line, out of  the back gate and down the lane.    True to her promise, Phyllis said nothing, but trudged along behind  Jack with wide open, watchful brown eyes.    By and bye the children came to a pond of shining, clear water.  How  still everything seemed, how brightly the sun shone!    \"Now if you talk you'll scare the fish,\" said Jack, with an air of  great importance.    \"I will not talk,\" Phyllis whispered back, shutting her lips very  tightly and sitting down beside her brother with a little sigh.    Jack threw his line--Phyllis watched with awe.  They sat for a moment  waiting for a \"bite.\"    Then Jack jerked the line up sharply, not so much because he thought he  had caught something, as because he hoped he would catch something.    \"I don't believe there are any fish here,\" he grumbled at last.    But Phyllis's bright eyes had caught sight of something and she forgot  all about the fishing and her resolve not to speak.    \"Look!\" she cried, pointing to a fallen tree-trunk which hung over the  water.    On a branch sat a bird.  He was considerably larger than a robin.    [Illustration: \"On a branch sat a bird.  He was considerably larger  than a robin\"]    On the top of his head was a tall crest, which reached to the nape of  his neck.    His back and the entire upper part of his body was blue.  His wings and  short tail bore spots and bars of white.    The lower part of his body was white and across his breast ran two  bands of blue.    \"His bill is longer than his head!\" laughed Phyllis.  \"What a funny big  head and what funny little feet!  Who is he, Jackie?\"    \"A kingfisher!\" Jack replied.    \"What is he doing?\" asked Phyllis.    \"Fishing,\" said Jack, shortly.    In a moment Jack spoke again.    \"There must be fish here if Mr. Kingfisher is on the lookout.  He is a  famous old fisherman.  He could not live without fish to eat.  Did you  notice the white spot above each eye?\"    Encouraged by the sight of the other fisherman, Jack again cast his  line and waited for a bite.    Phyllis watched the bird.  Suddenly it seemed to drop from the branch.  It dived into the water.    There was a great flutter and splash--a struggle.  Then the bird in the  blue and white uniform perched again on the old branch.    The children watched eagerly.    In the bird's strong bill was a scaly, glittering fish.  It wriggled  and flopped helplessly, but could not escape.    The bird held the fish firmly in its strong grasp, raised his head and  struck the fish three or four sharp knocks against the branch.  Then  the fish wriggled no longer.    \"He can never swallow that big fellow!\" cried Jack, forgetting his own  fishing.  \"I have seen kingfishers swallow minnows alive and whole, but  that fish is too large for him to manage!\"    The bird, however, seemed to think that he could \"manage\" it.  He  started to swallow the fish.  When it was half-way down his throat it  stuck.    With much sputtering and gagging the bird brought the fish up again.  But he must have his dinner, and not in the least discouraged, tried  again.    He gagged and writhed.  The scales and fins stuck in his throat.  Up  came the fish again.    Four--five times he struggled to swallow the fish.  Five times he  failed to succeed.  Five times the fish-scales glittered again in the  sunlight.  Such strange wrigglings and twistings the bird made.    \"The poor fellow is having an unhappy time with his lunch,\" laughed the  children.    At the sixth effort the fish was safely landed in the bird's stomach.    With a flash of blue wings he circled through the air.  He gave a noisy  rattling cry as he alighted on a branch nearer to the children.    Again the bird watched the water intently.  Again he dived like a  flash.  Again he bore a fish to the surface and killed it by striking  it against the tree.    But this time the kingfisher did not swallow the fish.  He rose with it  in his bill and flew gracefully away.    The children watched for some time, but the strange blue bird did not  return.  Then Jack turned again to his fishing.    \"I thought you were to furnish the thimbleberries for lunch,\" he said.    \"So I shall,\" Phyllis replied, snatching up her basket and starting off  in the direction of some bushes which she could see.    So Jack was left to his fishing and Phyllis went berrying.    Sure enough the bushes proved to be loaded with beautiful ripe berries.  Soon the little fingers were stained quite purple and the little basket  was half filled with berries.    As she started to return to her brother, Phyllis passed along the foot  of a high bank.  She was singing softly to herself when she heard the  rattling cry of the kingfisher quite near.    He gracefully swung into sight on wide-spread wings.  He bore another  fish in his strong bill.    When he saw Phyllis he stopped short and held himself perfectly still  in the air while he looked at her.    At length, deciding that she was harmless, he circled past the little  girl and entered a small hole on the face of the bank.    \"Why!\" said Phyllis.  \"I wonder why he has gone in there.  I shall wait  for him to return.\"    So Phyllis waited until the bird came out.  Then she held out her  basket of berries.    \"Will you have some of my berries?\" she said.  \"I'm sure that your  throat must be sore from the scratching of those fish-scales.  You had  to try so many times before you got it down.  Tell me, did this last  fish also stick in your throat?\"    The kingfisher \"chuckled\" deep down in his throat.    \"I do not eat berries,\" he said.  \"I usually eat fish.  I sometimes eat  large insects or shrimps, but I love to fish.\"    \"So does my brother,\" said Phyllis, politely, glancing at Jack sitting  motionless on a rock in the sunshine.    \"Why did you go into that hole to eat?\"    The kingfisher chuckled again.    \"That is my nest,\" he said.  \"My wife is in there.  I took the fish to  her.  She can fish quite as well as I, but our eggs are just hatching  and she dare not leave them.\"    \"That a bird's nest?\" cried Phyllis.  \"Who made it?\"    \"Mrs. Kingfisher and I did,\" was the reply.  \"We found this fine steep  bank when we came from the south in March.    \"I began the nest myself.  I held myself still in the air before the  bank just as I did when I first noticed you.  Then I drove my beak into  the soft bank with quick plunges.  How the clay rattled and rolled and  splashed into the water below!    \"It was but a very short time before I had a"]]]
