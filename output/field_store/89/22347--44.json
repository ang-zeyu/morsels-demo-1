Vocal culture is conducive to health, and aids in gaining  command of the nerves and muscles. They who profit by it will best  understand the varied nuances of intonation, expression and coloring of  which music is capable, and will learn how to make a musical instrument  sing. Likewise vocalists should familiarize themselves with other  domains of their art, and should be able to handle some instrument, more  especially the piano or organ, that they may be brought into intimate  relations with the harmonic structure of music.    To make music study most effective the scientific methods of other  departments of learning must be applied to it. For the supreme good of  both art and science need to be brought into close fellowship. Art is  the child of feeling and imagination; science the child of reason. Art  requires the illumination of science; science the insight of art. Music  combines within itself the qualities of art and science. As a science it  is a well-ordered system of laws, and cannot be comprehended without  knowledge of these. As an art, it is its business to awaken a mood, to  express a sentiment; it is knowledge made efficient by skill--thought,  effect, taste and feeling brought into active exercise.    No art, no science, affords opportunity for more magnificent mental  discipline than music. Moreover, a careful, earnest study of the art  furnishes a stimulus to activity in other fruitful fields. Although  subordinate to life and character it contributes freely to these, and  its best results come from life that is exceeding rich, and character  that is strong, true and enlightened through broad, general culture. The  musical education that educates develops something more than mere  players and singers; it develops thinking, feeling musicians, in whom  large personalities may be recognized.    Stephen A. Emory of Boston, whose studies in harmony are widely used,  and who left behind him an influence as a teacher that is far-reaching,  divined the true secret of musical education, from the rudiments upward,  and expressed his views freely and clearly. He thought it indispensable  for the musician to make music the central point of his efforts and  equally indispensable for him to have, as supports to this, knowledge  and theories from countless sources. \"It must be as a noble river,\" he  said of the pursuit of music; \"though small and unobserved in its  source, winding at first alone its tortuous way through opposing  obstacles, yet ever broadening and deepening, fed by countless streams  on either hand till it rolls onward in a mighty sweep, at once a glory  and a blessing to the earth.\"    To conquer music a musician must have conquered self. As music can no  more be absolutely conquered than self, the effort to gain the mastery  over both necessitates a continual healthy, earnest striving, which  makes the individual grow in strength, grace and happiness. That  musician has been rightly trained whose every thought, mood and feeling,  every muscle and fibre, have been brought under the subjection of his  will. Professor Huxley uttered the following words that may well be  applied to a musical education:    \"That man, I think, has had a liberal education, who has been so trained  in his youth that his body is the ready servant of his will and does  with ease and pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable  of; whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts  of equal strength and in smooth working order; ready, like the steam  engine, to be turned to any kind of work, and spin the gossamers as well  as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is stored with knowledge of  the great and fundamental truths of nature and of the laws of her  operations, one, who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire, but  whose passions are trained to come to feel, by a vigorous will, the  servant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all beauty,  whether of nature, or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect  others as himself.\"    The correctness of applying the last clause to the musician will be  questioned by those who delight in enlarging on the petty jealousies of  musicians. It will be learned in time that these foibles belong only to  petty musicians, and that no one knows better how to respect others as  himself than one who has enjoyed the privilege of the musical education  that educates.          IV    How to Interpret Music      Certain learned college professors were once heard discussing methods of  literary criticism and interpretation. They spoke of external and  technical forms, and how magnificently these were illustrated in the  world's acknowledged masterpieces of literature. Every work read or  studied, they decided, should be carefully weighed, measured and  analyzed, and should be judged solely by the maxims and laws deduced  from classical standards. The critical faculty must never be permitted  to slumber or to sleep. Above all, the literary student should beware of  trusting to impressions.    Not a word was uttered in regard to the contents of the masterpieces in  question, the special emotions, the overwhelming passions they revealed,  the mighty experiences of which they were the result. Nothing was said  about the source of a great book in the life of its author, or its value  as a record of what many minds and hearts of an entire epoch have  thought, felt and desired. The learned professors were so deeply  concerned with what they considered the demands of strict scholarship  that they lost sight of the spirit which animates every true work of  art. To them literature consisted of words, phrases, sentences, figures  of speech, classical allusions, and well-constructed forms. They  regarded it apparently as an artificial product, compounded according to  traditional and cautiously prescribed recipes.    An aged man of letters present, one who was characterized by his ripe  scholarship, his richly cultured personality, sat listening in silence  to the conversation. Suddenly he rose up, and, in vibrant tones,  exclaimed: \"Where hath the soul of literature fled, its vital part? If  we are to trample upon our impressions the best that is within us will  be chilled. Of what avail is education if it does not lead to the  unfolding of our God-given intuitions? Friends, if the trend of modern  criticism be to divorce literature from life, the throb and thrill of  great art will soon cease to be felt.\"    The lesson conveyed by these words may with equal propriety be applied  to the field of music. Viewing certain current tendencies the cultured  musician is often moved to wonder where the soul of music has fled. The  critical faculty is keenly alive to-day, but musical criticism, shorn of  its better part, musical appreciation, can never lead to the insight  requisite for true musical interpretation. Observation and perception,  intellectual discernment and spiritual penetration are essential to gain  insight into a great musical composition until its musical ideas, the  very grade and texture of its style, are absolutely appropriated.    In his \"Death in the Desert,\" Robert Browning tells of the three souls  that make up the soul of man: the soul which Does; the soul which Knows,  feels, thinks and wills, and the soul which Is and which constitutes  man's real self. Appreciation of music requires the utmost activity of  all three souls. The more we are, the broader our culture, the more we  think, feel and know, the more we will find in music. Dr. Hiram Corson,  commenting on Browning's words, says the rectification, or adjustment of  what Is, that which constitutes our true being, should transcend all  other aims of education. If this fact were more generally accepted and  enforced it could soon no longer be said that few persons reach maturity  without the petrifaction of some faculty of mind and heart.    Every faculty we possess needs to be keenly alive for the interpretation  of the best in music. One who is accustomed to earnest thinking, quick  observation and sympathetic penetration will see, hear and feel much  that utterly escapes those whose best faculties have been permitted to  lie dormant, or become petrified. The interpreter of music must have  vital knowledge of the inner, spiritual element of every work of art he  attempts to reproduce. His imagination must be kindled by it, and  musical imagination is infinitely more precious than musical mechanism.    It is by no means intended to underrate technical proficiency. No one  can be a satisfactory exponent of music whose technique is deficient,  however profound may be his musicianly understanding and feeling. At the  same time, with every tone, every measure, mechanically correct, a  performance may fail to move the listener, because it lacks warmth and  glow. Only they can make others feel who feel themselves, but sentiment  is apt to be confounded with sentimentality unless it is guided by a  scholarly mind. The more feeling is spiritualized with thought the  nobler it will be. Heart and head need to operate in company with  well-controlled physical forces, in order that a fine interpretation of  music may be attained. Faultless technique, in the service of a lofty  ideal, indeed ceases to be mechanical and becomes artistic.    A musical work of art originates in the deep well of the fertile  imagination of genius, and can only be drawn forth when the composer is  in that highly exalted frame of mind we call inspiration. The theme, or  musical subject, is a vital spark of the divine fire, and has flashed  unbidden into his consciousness, demanding undivided attention for its  logical development. With infinite care he molds and groups the musical  factors which are his working forces, and of which he has both an  intuitive and a practical knowledge. The manifold forms he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#7)"],[1," change in you. You  have the skill. Portray her.\"    Madhava, in return, delineates the likeness of Malati on the same tablet  and Makaranda writes under it the following impassioned love-stanza,      \"Whatever nature loveliness displays,    May seem to others beautiful and bright;    But since these charms have broken upon my gaze,    They form my life's sole exquisite delight.\"    Being asked by Makaranda as to how and where Malati first saw Madhava,  Mandarika says, \"Malati was called to the lattice by Lavangika to look  at him as he passed the palace.\"    The picture is restored to Mandarika and brought back to Malati.    The mutual passion of the lovers, encouraged by their respective  confidants, is naturally increased.    Madhava thus addresses Makaranda,    \"It is strange, most strange! wherever I turn, the same loved charms  appear on every side. Her beauteous face gleams as brightly as the  golden bud of the young lotus. Alas! my friend, this fascination spreads  over all my senses. A feverish flame consumes my strength. My heart is  all on fire. My mind is tossed with doubt. Every faculty is absorbed in  one fond thought.    I cease to be myself or conscious of the thing I am.\"    Malati thus addresses Lavangika:--    \"Love spreads through every vein like subtlest poison and, like fire  that brightens in the breeze, consumes this feeble frame. Resistless  fever preys on each fibre. Its fury is fatal. No one can help me.  Neither father nor mother nor Lavangika can save me. Life is distasteful  to me.    Repeatedly recurring to the anguish of my heart, I lose all fortitude  and in my grief become capricious and unjust. Forgive me. Let the full  moon blaze in the mighty sky. Let love rage on. Death screens me from  his fury.\"    In the meantime, the king makes the long-expected demand and the  minister Bhurivasu returns the following ambiguous answer:--    \"Your Majesty may dispose of your daughter as your Majesty pleases.\"    [This answer is used in a double sense:--    \"Your minister's daughter is your own daughter and you can dispose of  her as you please,\" and \"You can dispose of your own daughter as you  please, but not my daughter.\"    The father's connivance at his daughter's stolen marriage would appear  inconsistent if the reply is not understood in its double sense.]    The intelligence reaches the lovers. They are thrown into despair.    Requested by Lavangika, Kamandaki thus describes Madhava in the presence  of Malati:--    \"The sovereign of Vidarbha boasts for minister the wise and  long-experienced Devarata, who bears the burden of state and spreads  throughout the world his piety and fame. Your father knows him well.  For, in their youth, they were joined in study and trained to learning  by the same preceptor.    In this world we rarely behold such characters as theirs. Their lofty  rank is the abode of wisdom and of piety, of valour and of virtue. Their  fame spreads white and spotless through the universe. A son has sprung  from Devarata whose opening virtues early give occasion of rejoicing to  the world. Now, in his bloom, this youth has been sent to our city to  collect ripe stores of knowledge. His name is Madhava.\"    Kamandaki soliloquises thus:--    \"Malati is tutored to our wishes and inspired with hatred of the  bridegroom Nandan. He is reminded of the examples of _Sakuntala_ and  _Vasavadatta_ that vindicate the free choice of a husband. Her  admiration of her youthful lover is now approved by his illustrious  birth and my encomium of his high descent. All this must strengthen and  confirm her passion. Now their union may be left to fate.\"    By the contrivance of Kamandaki, a second interview between the lovers  takes place in the public garden of the temple of _Sankara_. Malati is  persuaded that the god _Sankara_ is to be propitiated with offerings of  flowers gathered by one's self. Whilst she is collecting her oblation  she and Madhava meet as if by accident.    At this moment, a great tumult and terrific screams announce that a  tremendous tiger has escaped from an iron cage in the temple of Siva,  spreading destruction everywhere. Instantly, Nandana's youthful sister,  Madayantika happens to be passing, and is attacked by the tiger and is  reported to be in imminent danger.    Madhava and Makaranda both rush to the rescue. The latter kills the  animal, and thus saves her who is then brought in a half-fainting state  into the garden. He is himself wounded. Mandayantika is thus saved by  the valour of Makaranda. The gallant youth is brought in insensible. By  the care of the women, he revives.    On recovering, Madayantika naturally falls in love with her deliverer.    The two couples are thus brought together. Malati affiances herself  there and then to Madhava.    Soon afterwards, the king prepares to enforce the marriage of Malati  with Nandan. A messenger arrives to summon Madayantika to be present at  the marriage. Another messenger summons Malati herself to the king's  place.    Madhava is mad with grief and in despair makes the extraordinary  resolution of purchasing the aid of ghosts and malignant spirits by  going to the cemetery and offering them living flesh, cut off from his  own body, as food. He accordingly bathes in the river Sindhu and goes at  night to the cemetery. The cemetery happens to be near the temple of the  awful goddess Chamunda, a form of Durga. The temple is presided over by  a sorceress named Kapalkundla and her preceptor, a terrible necromancer  Aghorghanta. They have determined on offering some beautiful maiden as  a human victim to the goddess. With this object they carry off Malati,  before her departure, while asleep on a terrace and bringing her to the  temple, are about to kill her at the shrine when her cries of distress  attract the attention of Madhava, who is, at the moment, in the cemetery  offering his flesh to the ghosts.    He thinks he recognizes the voice of Malati. He rushes forward to her  rescue. She is discovered dressed as a victim and the magician and the  sorceress are preparing for the sacrifice.    He encounters Aghorghanta and, after a terrific hand-to-hand fight,  kills him and rescues Malati.    She flies to his arms. Voices are heard as of persons in search of  Malati. Madhava places her in safety.    The sorceress vows vengeance against Madhava for slaying her preceptor  Aghorghanta.    Malati is now restored to her friends. The preparations for Malati's  wedding with Nandana goes on. The old priestess Kamandaki, who favours  the union of Malati with her lover Madhava, contrives that, by the  king's command, the bridal dress shall be put on at the very temple  where her own ministrations are conducted.    There she persuades Makaranda to substitute himself for the bride. He  puts on the bridal dress, is carried in procession to the house of  Nandan and goes through the form of being married to him. Nandana, being  disgusted with the masculine appearance of the pretended bride, and  offended by the rude reception given to him, vows to have no further  communication with her and consigns her to his sister's care in the  inner apartments. This enabled Makaranda to effect an interview with  Nandana's sister Madayantika, the object of his own affections.    Makaranda then discovers himself to his mistress and persuades her to  run away with him to the place where Malati and Madhava have concealed  themselves.    Their flight is discovered. The king's guards are sent in pursuit. A  great fight follows; but Makaranda, assisted by Madhava, defeats his  opponents. The bravery and handsome appearance of the two youths avert  the king's anger and they are allowed to join their friends unpunished.    The friends accordingly assemble at the gate of the temple.    But the sorceress, who has been watching an opportunity when Malati is  unprotected, takes advantage of the confusion and carries her off in a  flying car, in revenge for the death of her preceptor. The distress of  her lover and friends knows no bounds. They are reduced to despair at  this second obstacle to the marriage. They give up all hopes of  recovering her when they are happily relieved by the opportune arrival  of Soudamini, an old pupil of the priestess Kamandaki, who has acquired  extraordinary magical powers by her penances.    She rescues Malati from the hands of the sorceress and restores her to  her despairing lover.    The two couples are now united in happy wedlock.          HANUMAN NATAKA, OR MAHANATAKA, OR THE GREAT DRAMA.      In Ayodhya, there was an illustrious and powerful monarch, the subduer  of foes and the renowned ornament of the exalted house of the sun, named  Dasaratha in whose family, for the purpose of relieving the Earth of her  burden, Bhurisravas (Vishnu) deigned to incorporate his divine substance  as four blooming youths. The eldest, endowed with the qualities of  imperial worth, was Rama.    He goes with his brother Lakshmana to the court of Mithila, to try his  strength in the bending of the bow of Siva, and thereby win Sita for his  bride. The hero triumphs. The bow is broken with a deafening sound which  brings Parasurama there. Rama wins his bride. He tries the bow of  Parasurama and shoots an arrow from it which flies to Swerga or heaven.  The Brahmin hero now acknowledges the Kshatriya hero to be his superior.  Rama is married to Sita. The sweet loves of the happy pair grows with  enjoyment.    Various portents then indicate Rama's impending separation from his  father. The sun looks forth dimmed in radiance. Fiery torches wave along  the sky. Meteors dart headlong through midheaven. Earth shakes. The  firmament rains showers of blood. Around, the horizon thickens. In the  day, the pale stars gleam. Unseasonable eclipse darkens the noon. Day  echoes with the howls of dogs and jackals, whilst the air replies with  horrid and strange sounds, such as shall peal, when the destroying deity  proclaims in thunder the"]]]
