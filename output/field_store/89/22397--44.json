The quinine of commerce will  doubtless come hereafter from the slopes of the Himalayas instead of the  Andes. In 1867 only five thousand pounds of bark were exported from  Guayaquil. The Indians use the bark of another tree, the _Maravilla_,  which is said to yield a much stronger alkaloid than cinchona. It grows  near Pallatanga.    [Footnote 14: This celebrated febrifuge was first taken to Europe about  the middle of the seventeenth century, and was named after the Countess  of Chinchon, who had been cured of intermittent fever at Lima.  Afterward, when Cardinal de Lugo spread the knowledge of the remedy  through France, and recommended it to Cardinal Mazarin, it received the  name of _Jesuits' Bark_. The French chemists, Pelletier and Caverton,  discovered quinine in 1820.]    We left Guaranda at 5 A.M. by the light of Venus and Orion, having  exchanged our horses for the sure-footed mule. It was a romantic ride.  From a neighboring stand-point Church took one of his celebrated views  of \"The Heart of the Andes.\" But the road, as aforetime, was a mere  furrow, made and kept by the tread of beasts. For a long distance the  track runs over the projecting and jagged edges of steeply-inclined  strata of slate, which nobody has had the energy to smooth down. At many  places on the road side were human skulls, set in niches in the bank,  telling tales of suffering in their ghastly silence; while here and  there a narrow passage was blocked up by the skeleton or carcass of a  beast that had borne its last burden. At nine o'clock we came out on a  narrow, grassy ridge called the Ensillada, or Saddleback, where there  were three straw huts, with roofs resting on the ground, and there we  breakfasted on _locro_. During our stay the Indians killed a pig, and  before the creature was fairly dead dry grass was heaped upon it and set  on fire. This is the ordinary method of removing the bristles.    Still ascending, we lose sight of the valley of the Chimbo, and find  ourselves in a wilderness of crags and treeless mountains clothed with  the long, dreary-looking paramo grass called _paja_. But we are face to  face with \"the monarch of the Andes,\" and we shall have its company the  rest of the day. The snowy dome is flooded with the golden light of  heaven; delicate clouds of softest hues float around its breast; while,  far below, its feet are wrapped in the baser mists of earth. We attained  the summit of the pass at 11 A.M. All travelers strive to reach it early  in the morning, for in the afternoon it is swept by violent winds which  render it uncomfortable, if not dangerous. This part of the road is  called the \"Arenal,\" from the sand and gravel which cover it. It is  about a league in length, and crosses the side of Chimborazo at an  elevation of more than fourteen thousand feet. Chimborazo stands on the  left of the traveler. How tantalizing its summit! It appears so easy of  access; and yet many a valiant philosopher, from Humboldt down, has  panted for the glory and failed. The depth of the snow and numerous  precipices are the chief obstacles; but the excessively rarefied air is  another hinderance. Even in crossing the Arenal, a native of the  lowlands complains of violent headache, a propensity to vomit, and a  difficulty of breathing. The Arenal is often swept by snow-storms; and  history has it that some of the Spanish conquerors were here frozen to  death. The pale yellow gravel is considered by some geologists as the  moraine of a glacier. It is spread out like a broad gravel walk, so  that, without exaggeration, one of the best roads in Ecuador has been  made by Nature's hand on the crest of the Andes.    It was interesting to trace the different hypsometrical zones by the  change of vegetation from Bodegas to this lofty spot. The laws of the  decrease of heat are plainly written on the rapid slopes of the  Cordilleras. On the hot, steaming lowlands of the coast reign bananas  and palms. As these thin out, tree-ferns take their place. Losing these,  we found the cinchona bedewed by the cool clouds of Guaranda; and last  of all, among the trees, the polylepis. The twisted, gnarled trunk of  this tree, as well as its size and silvery foliage, reminded us of the  olive, but the bark resembles that of the birch. It reaches the greatest  elevation of any tree on the globe. Then followed shrubby fuchsia,  calceolaria, eupatoria, and red and purple gentians; around and on the  Arenal, a uniform mantle of monocotyledonous plants, with scattered  tufts of valeriana, viola, and geranium, all with rigid leaves in the  characteristic rosettes of super-alpine vegetation; and on the  porphyritic and trachytic sides of Chimborazo, lichens alone. Snow then  covers the last effort of vegetable life.[15] The change in the  architecture of the houses indicated, likewise, a change of altitude.  The open bamboo huts, shingled with banana leaves, were followed by  warmer _adobe_ houses, and these, in turn, by the straw hovels of the  mountain-top, made entirely of the long, wiry grass of the paramos.    [Footnote 15: According to Sir J. Hooker, among the flowers which adorn  the slopes of the Himalayas, rhododendrons occupy the most prominent  place, and primroses next. There are no orchids, neither red gentians,  but blue. Organic life ceases 3000 feet lower than on the Andes; yet it  is affirmed that flowering plants occur at the height of 18,460 feet,  which is equivalent to the summit of Chimborazo in point of temperature!  The polylepis (_P. racemosa_) is one of the _Sanguisorbaceae_; in Quichua  it is _Sachaquinoa_.]    Leaving the Arenal, we rapidly descended by the usual style of  road--stone stairs. But down we went, as all the goods for Quito, \"the  grand capital,\" have done since the Spanish Conquest. The old road from  Beirut to Damascus is royal in comparison. The general aspect of the  eastern slope is that of a gray, barren waste, overgrown with _paja_;  but now and then we crossed deep gulleys, whose sides were lined with  mosses and sprinkled with calceolarias, lupines, etc. In our descent we  had before us the magnificent Valley of Quito, and beyond it the eastern  Cordillera. Below us was Riobamba, and far away to the right the deep  gorge of the Pastassa. Nevertheless, this is one of the loneliest rides  earth can furnish. Not a tree nor human habitation is in sight. Icy  rivulets and mule-trains are the only moving objects on this melancholy  heath. Even \"Drake's Plantation Bitters,\" painted on the volcanic cliffs  of Chimborazo, would be a relief.    At last we reached our rude accommodations for the night. It was a  solitary mud tambo, glorying in the euphonious name of Chuquipoyo. The  court-yard was a sea of mud and manure, for this is the halting-place  for all the caravans between Quito and the coast. Our room was a horrid  hole, dark, dirty, damp, and cold, without a window or a fire. There was  one old rickety bedstead, but as that belonged to the lady in our party,  the rest betook themselves to benches, table, and floor. We filled our  stomachs with an unpalatable potato soup containing cheese and eggs, and  laid down--to wait for the morning. Grass is the only fuel here; but  this is not the chief reason why it is so difficult to make good tea or  cook potatoes at this wretched tambo. Water boils at 190 deg., or before it  is fairly hot: it is well the potatoes are small. The muleteers slept  with their beasts outside, though the night was fearfully cold, for  Chuquipoyo lies on the frigid side of Chimborazo, at an elevation of  over twelve thousand feet above the sea. As Johnson said to Boswell,  \"This is a dolorous place.\"    Gladly we left this cheerless tambo, though a cold, heavy mist was  falling as we rode northward, over the seemingly endless paramo of  Sanancajas. Here, as throughout the highlands of Ecuador, ditches are  used for fences; so that, should the traveler wander from the path, he  finds himself stopped by an impassable gulf. In two hours and a half we  reached Mocha, a lifeless pueblo under the shadow of Carguairazo. Slowly  descending from our high altitude, we gradually entered a more congenial  climate--the zone of wheat and barley, till, finally, signs of an  eternal spring were all around us--ripening corn on one side, and  blossoming peas on the other.    Late in the afternoon the road led us through a sandy, sterile tract,  till suddenly we came in sight of Ambato, beautifully situated in a deep  ravine, eight thousand five hundred and fifty feet above the Pacific.  The city ranks next to Quito in beauty. It is certainly an oasis, the  green foliage of its numerous shade-trees and orchards contrasting with  the barren hills around. It is two degrees warmer than Quito, and is  famous for its fruit and fine climate. It is the Lynn of Ecuador, the  chief articles of manufacture being boots and shoes--cheap, but of poor  quality. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1698. The houses are built  of sun-dried brick, and whitewashed. The streets, with gutters in the  centre, are at right angles, and paved, and adorned with numerous  cypress-looking trees, called _sauce_, a species of willow. The Plaza,  which contains a useful if not ornamental fountain, presents a lively  scene on Sunday, the great market-day. The inn is a fair specimen of a  public house in Spanish America. Around the court-yard, where the beasts  are fed, are three or four rooms to let. They are ventilated only when  opened for travelers. The floor is of brick, but alive with fleas; the  walls are plastered, but veiled with cobwebs. The furniture, of  primitive make and covered with dust, consists of a chair or two, a  table, and a bed of boards covered with a thin straw mat. There is not a  hotel in Ecuador where sheets and towels are furnished.

(#7)"],[1,"ity, but in peace, the civil  union was in a great measure dissolved, and the inferior leaders  administered justice, after an independent manner, each in his  particular district. These were elected by the votes of the people in  their great councils; and though regard was paid to nobility in the  choice, their personal qualities, chiefly their valor, procured  them, from the suffrages of their fellow-citizens, that honorable but  dangerous distinction. The warriors of each tribe attached themselves  to the[**possibly this word is their] leader, with the most devoted  affection and most unshaken constancy. They attended him as his ornament  in peace, as his defence in war, as his council in the administration of  justice. Their constant emulation in military renown dissolved not that  inviolable friendship which they professed to their chieftain and to  each other. To die for the honor of their band was their chief ambition;  to survive its disgrace, or the death of their leader, was infamous.  They even carried into the field their women and children, who adopted  all the martial sentiments of the men: and being thus impelled by every  human motive, they were invincible; where they were no[**possibly the  word is not] opposed, either by the similar manners and institutions  of the neighboring Germans, or by the superior discipline, arms, and  numbers of the Romans.[*]         [* Caesar, lib. vi.]    The leaders and their military companions were maintained by the labor  of their slaves, or by that of the weaker and less warlike part of the  community whom they defended. The contributions which they levied went  not beyond a bare subsistence; and the honors, acquired by a superior  rank, were the only reward of their superior dangers and fatigues. All  the refined arts of life were unknown among the Germans: tillage itself  was almost wholly neglected; they even seem to have been anxious to  prevent any improvements of that nature; and the leaders, by annually  distributing anew all the land among the inhabitants of each village,  kept them from attaching themselves to particular possessions, or  making such progress in agriculture as might divert their attention from  military expeditions, the chief occupation of the community.[*]         [* Tacit. de Mor. Germ]    The Saxons had been for some time regarded as one of the most warlike  tribes of this fierce people, and had become the terror of the  neighboring nations.[*]         [* Amm. Marcell. lib. xxviii. Orosius.]    They had diffused themselves from the northern parts of Germany and the  Cimbrian Chersonesus, and had taken possession of all the sea-coast  from the mouth of the Rhine to Jutland; whence they had long infested  by their piracies all the eastern and southern parts of Britain, and the  northern of Gaul.[*]         [* Amm. Marcell. lib. xxvii. cap. 7. lib. xxviii. cap. 7]    In order to oppose their inroads, the Romans had established an officer,  whom they called \"Count of the Saxon shore;\" and as the naval arts can  flourish among a civilized people alone, they seem to have been more  successful in repelling the Saxons than any of the other barbarians by  whom they were invaded. The dissolution of the Roman power invited them  to renew their inroads; and it was an acceptable circumstance that  the deputies of the Britons appeared among them, and prompted them to  undertake an enterprise to which they were of themselves sufficiently  inclined.[*]         [* W. Malms, p. 8.]    Hengist and Horsa, two brothers, possessed great credit among the  Saxons, and were much celebrated both for their valor and nobility. They  were reputed, as most of the Saxon princes, to be sprung from Woden, who  was worshipped as a god among those nations, and they are said to be his  great grandsons;[*] a circumstance which added much to their authority.         [* Bede, lib. i. cap. 15. Chron. Sax. p. 13. Nennius, cap.       28.]    We shall not attempt to trace any higher the origin of those princes  and nations. It is evident what fruitless labor it must be to search,  in those barbarous and illiterate ages, for the annals of a people, when  their first leaders, known in any true history, were believed by them to  be the fourth in descent from a fabulous deity, or from a man exalted by  ignorance into that character. The dark industry of antiquaries, led by  imaginary analogies of names, or by uncertain traditions, would in  vain attempt to pierce into that deep obscurity which covers the remote  history of those nations.    These two brothers, observing the other provinces of Germany to be  occupied by a warlike and necessitous people, and the rich provinces of  Gaul already conquered or overrun by other German tribes, found it  easy to persuade their countrymen to embrace the sole enterprise  which promised a favorable opportunity of displaying their valor and  gratifying their avidity. They embarked their troops in three vessels  and about the year 449 or 450,[*] earned over one thousand six hundred  men, who landed in the Isle of Thanet, and immediately marched to the  defence of the Britons against the northern invaders. The Scots and  Picts were unable to resist the valor of these auxiliaries; and the  Britons, applauding their own wisdom in calling over the Saxons, hoped  thenceforth to enjoy peace and security under the powerful protection of  that warlike people.    But Hengist and Horsa, perceiving, from their easy victory over the  Scots and Picts, with what facility they might subdue tae Britons  themselves, who had not been able to resist those feeble invaders, were  determined to conquer and fight for their own grandeur, not for the  defence of their degenerate allies. They sent intelligence to Saxony  of the fertility and riches of Britain, and represented as certain the  subjection of a people so long disused to arms, who, being now cut off  from the Roman empire, of which they had been a province during so  many ages, had not yet acquired any union among themselves, and were  destitute of all affection to their new liberties, and of all national  attachments and regards.[**] The vices, and pusillanimity of Vortigern,  the British leader, were a new ground of hope; and the Saxons in  Germany, following such agreeable prospects, soon reenforced Hengist and  Horsa with five thousand men, who came over in seventeen vessels. The  Britons now began to entertain apprehensions of their allies, whose  numbers they found continually augmenting; but thought of no remedy,  except a passive submission and connivance. This weak expedient soon  failed them. The Saxons sought a quarrel, by complaining that their  subsidies were ill paid, and their provisions withdrawn;[***] and  immediately taking off the mask, they formed an alliance with the Picts  and Scots, and proceeded to open hostility against the Britons.    The Britons, impelled by these violent extremities, ana roused to  indignation against their treacherous auxiliaries, were necessitated to  take arms; and having deposed Vortigern, who had become odious from his  vices, and from the bad event of his rash counsels, they put themselves  under the Command of his son, Vortimer. They fought many battles with  their enemies; and though the victories in these actions be disputed  between the British and Saxon annalists, the progress still made by the  Saxons proves that the advantage was commonly on their side.         [* Chron. Sax. p. 12. W. Malms, p. 11. Hunting,       lib. U. p. 309. Ethelwerd, Brompton, p. 728.]         [** Chron. Sax. p. 12. Alured. Beverl. p. 49.]         [*** Bede, lib. i cap. 15. Nennius, cap. 35. Gildas,       sect 2d.]    In one battle, however, fought at Faglesford, now Ailsford, Horsa, the  Saxon general, was slain and left the sole command over his countrymen  in the hands of Hengist. This active general, continually reenforced  oy fresh numbers from Germany, carried devastation into the most remote  corners of Britain; and being chiefly anxious to spread the terror of  his arms, he spared neither age, nor sex, nor condition, wherever he  marched with his victorious forces. The private and public edifices of  the Britons were reduced to ashes; the priests were slaughtered on the  altars by those idolatrous ravagers; the bishops and nobility shared  the fate of the vulgar; the people, flying to the mountains and deserts,  were intercepted and butchered in heaps: some were glad to accept of  life and servitude under their victors: others, deserting their  native country, took shelter in the province of Armorica; where, being  charitably received by a people of the same language and manners, they  settled in great numbers, and gave the country the name of Brittany.[*]    The British writers assign one cause which facilitated the entrance of  the Saxons into this island--the love with which Vortigern was at  first seized for Rovena, the daughter of Hengist, and which that artful  warrior made use of to blind the eyes of the imprudent monarch.[**]  The same historians add, that Vortimer died; and that Vortigern,  being restored to the throne, accepted of a banquet from Hengist, at  Stonehenge, where three hundred of his nobility were treacherously  slaughtered, and himself detained captive.[***] But these stories seem  to have been invented by the Welsh authors, in order to palliate the  weak resistance made at first by their countrymen, and to account for  the rapid progress and licentious devastations of the Saxons.[****]    After the death of Vortimer, Ambrosius, a Briton, though of Roman  descent, was invested with the command over his countrymen, and  endeavored, not without success, to unite them in their resistance  against the Saxons. Those contests increased the animosity between the  two rations, and roused the military spirit of the ancient inhabitants,  which had before been sunk into a fatal lethargy.
