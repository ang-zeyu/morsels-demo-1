They  are dishonest callings.' I was angry when he read it; but I held my  peace.\"    \"You did well, my son, to hold your peace. I myself have often heard  such words, of late, from the doctors in the synagogues; but it is not  wise to answer them. Where they got their notions, I know not. From  the Egyptians, I think, more than from the prophets. All Egyptians  hate shepherds, and can never speak of them without sneering. Perhaps  they have not yet forgotten how the shepherds conquered and ruled them  for generations. Nevertheless, there is some reason why the calling of  the shepherds should be despised. Many of them are rude and fierce  men. Living out of doors so constantly makes their manners rough and  their temper harsh. They are often quarrelsome. Such bloody fights as  I used to see among them, at the wells in the south country, where  they brought their flocks to water and each one wanted the first  chance at the well, I hope you will never look upon.\"    \"But all shepherds are not so,\" protested Joseph.    \"No, indeed. Brave men they must be; fleet of foot and strong of limb  and stout of heart; but brave men are not always quarrelsome. Many a  shepherd whom I have known had a heart as pure and gentle as a  child's. And the godliest men that I have known have been among them.  If the shepherd has but learned to think, to commune with his own  soul, he has time for thought and time for prayer. More than one with  whom I have watched upon these hills knew all the Psalms of David by  heart and many of the books of the prophets. The doctors in the  synagogues teach only the law; the shepherds love best the Psalms and  the prophets. They do not forget that King David was himself a  shepherd's lad. It was upon these very hills that he kept his father's  sheep. It was in that ravine over yonder, on that hillside, that he, a  mere stripling, caught by the beard and killed the lion and the bear  that attacked the sheep. It was on that slope, just a little to the  south, that the messenger found him with his flocks when he was called  home to be anointed by Samuel the prophet. When the doctors talk so  contemptuously about the shepherds, I wonder if they do not remember  that the great king wrote: 'The Lord is my Shepherd.' How can our  calling be so mean as they say, when David, who was called from the  sheepfolds, praises the Eternal One himself as his Shepherd? But hark!  what noise is that I hear? There is some trouble among the sheep.\"    \"Let me run and see,\" answers the boy, \"and I will come and bring you  word.\"    So saying, Joseph cast off his father's shaggy coat, seized the sling  in his left hand and the crook in his right and ran swiftly out to the  brow of the hill. He was a strong lad, large of frame and a swift  runner, and the sling in his hand was a sure weapon. The old man  looked after him with pride, as he bounded over the rocks, and said to  himself:    \"Some evil beast, I doubt not. But the lad's heart is brave and he  must learn to face dangers. I will wait a moment.\"    Presently the sheep came huddling round the hill in terror. The quick,  faint bleat of the ewes showed that they had seen a foe. The old man  arose and hurried in the direction in which the lad had disappeared.  Joseph was just returning, breathless, from the ravine below.    \"It was a wolf, grandfather. The sheep on this side of the ledge had  seen him and were flying. Just as I reached the brow of the hill, he  was creeping round the end of the ledge below, ready to spring upon a  ewe that was feeding near. The first thing he knew a stone from my  sling hit him, and he went howling down the hill. I think I broke his  leg, for he went on three legs and I gained on him as I ran after him;  but he crawled into a narrow place among the rocks in the gorge down  yonder, and I could not follow him.\"    \"Well done, my lad,\" said the ancient Stephanus proudly. \"You will  make a good shepherd. These single wolves are cowards. It is always  safe to face them. When they come in packs, it is quite another thing.  But this fellow will keep at a safe distance for the rest of the  night, you may depend. Let us go back to our shelter and call the  sheep together.\"    It was several minutes before Stephanus and Joseph could collect the  sheep that the wolf had scattered; but at length, with the aid of the  dog, who was not a very brave specimen, and who had taken to his heels  when he saw the wolf coming, they succeeded in driving them into a  safe neighborhood, and then, with their blood quickened by the  adventure, they sat down again beneath the overhanging rock.    \"You said, grandfather, that you always spent this night with the  flocks in the fields. Why this night?\" asked the boy.    \"Do you not know, my boy, that this is the night of the year on which  the Lord Christ was born?\"    \"Oh! yes,\" answered the lad. \"My father told me as we were walking  hither today, but I had forgotten it. And you were with the sheep that  night?\"    \"Aye.\"    \"Where was it?\"    \"Here, on this very spot.\"    The boy's eyes began to grow and fill with wonder and there was a  slight tremor in his voice as he hurriedly plied the aged man with his  eager questions. Stephanus drew his shepherd's cloak around him, and  leaned forward a little, and looked out upon the silent moonlit hills,  and then up into the sky.    \"How long ago was that, grandfather?\"    \"Just fifty years ago this night.\"    \"And how old were you then?\"    \"Fourteen, and a stout boy for my age. I had been for two years in  the fields with my father, and had tasted to the full the hardships  and dangers of the shepherd's life.\"    \"Who were with you on that night?\"    \"My father, and his brother, James, and Hosea, the son of John, a  neighbor and kinsman of ours. On that year, as on this year and often,  there came in the midwinter a dry and warm season between the early  and the latter rain. We had driven forth our flocks from Bethlehem and  were dwelling by night in the shelter of the tower on the hillside  yonder, watching and sleeping two and two. My father and I were wont  to keep the early watches. At midnight we would call James and Hosea,  and they would watch till the morning. But that night, when the sun  went down and the stars came out, we were sitting here, upon this  hillside, talking of the troubles of Israel and of the promises of  deliverance spoken by the prophets; and James and Hosea were asking my  father questions, and he was answering them, for he was older than  they, and all the people of Bethlehem reverenced him as a wise and  devout man. Some even said that, if the people of Israel had not  ceased to look for prophets, they would have counted him a prophet. I  remember well that, when he rose in the synagogue, it seemed as if  some wisdom from on high touched his lips, and he would speak with  such hope and courage of the light that should yet shine in our  darkness and of the help that should yet arise to Judah, that the  people's faces would glow with joyful expectation.\"    Stephanus paused a moment and started forward, as his eye was turned  toward his own shadow upon the rock, cast by the rising moon. Did the  old man's figure that he saw remind him of the patriarch of whom he  was talking?    Soon he went on.    \"Ah! but they should have heard my father talking here by night, under  the stars. It was here upon these hills where the royal shepherd used  to sing, that his tongue was loosed and he spoke wonderful words. So  it was that night, fifty years ago. I remember it as if it were  yesterday. My father sat in this very niche, where I am sitting now;  James and Hosea were on either side of him. I was lying at their feet,  as you now lie at mine. Their faces kindled and the tremor of deep  feeling was in their voices as they talked together; and the other two  had lingered here three or four hours after the sun had set. It was  not a moonlit night like this, but all the stars were out and all the  winds were still.    \"Suddenly I saw my father rise to his feet. Then the other men sprang  up, with astonishment and wonder upon their faces. It had grown light  all at once, lighter than the brightest moon; and as I turned my face  in the direction in which the others were looking, I saw, standing  there upon that level place, a figure majestic and beautiful beyond  all the power of words to tell.\"    \"Were you not afraid, grandfather?\"    \"Indeed, I was, my boy. My heart stopped beating. The others were  standing, but I had no power to rise. I lay there motionless upon the  earth. My eyes were fixed upon that wonderful face; upon those clear,  shining eyes; upon that brow that seemed to beam with the purity of  the soul within. It was not a smile with which that face was lighted.  It was something too noble and exalted to call by that name. It was a  look that told of power and peace, of joy and triumph.\"    \"Did you know that it was an angel?\"    \"I knew not anything. I only knew that what I saw was glorious, too  glorious for mortal eyes to look upon. Yet, while I gazed, and in far  less time than I have now taken to tell you of what I saw, the  terribleness of the look began to disappear, the sweetness and grace  of the soul shone forth, and I had almost ceased to tremble before the  angel opened his mouth. And when he spoke, his voice, clearer than any  trumpet and sweeter than any lute, charmed away all my fears.\"    \"'Be not afraid' he said, 'for behold I bring you good tidings of  great joy which shall be to all people. For there is born to you this  day, in the City of David, a Savior, which is Messiah, the King. And  this is the sign unto you. Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling  clothes and lying in a manger.'    \"Oh! that voice, my boy! It makes my heart beat now to remember its  sweetness. It seemed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#7)"],[1," midst of  immensity. There is something offensive in its neatness: for the wood is  almost always perfectly clean, and looks as if it had just been cut; it  is consequently raw in its color, and destitute of all variety of tone.  This is especially disagreeable, when the eye has been previously  accustomed to, and finds, everywhere around, the exquisite mingling of  color, and confused, though perpetually graceful, forms, by which the  details of mountain scenery are peculiarly distinguished. Every fragment  of rock is finished in its effect, tinted with thousands of pale lichens  and fresh mosses; every pine tree is warm with the life of various  vegetation; every grassy bank glowing with mellowed color, and waving  with delicate leafage. How, then, can the contrast be otherwise than  painful, between this perfect loveliness, and the dead, raw, lifeless  surface of the deal boards of the cottage. Its weakness is pitiable;  for, though there is always evidence of considerable strength on close  examination, there is no _effect_ of strength: the real thickness of the  logs is concealed by the cutting and carving of their exposed surfaces;  and even what is seen is felt to be so utterly contemptible, when  opposed to the destructive forces which are in operation around, that  the feelings are irritated at the imagined audacity of the inanimate  object, with the self-conceit of its impotence; and, finally, the eye is  offended at its want of size. It does not, as might be at first  supposed, enhance the sublimity of surrounding scenery by its  littleness, for it provokes no comparison; and there must be proportion  between objects, or they cannot be compared. If the Parthenon, or the  Pyramid of Cheops, or St. Peter's, were placed in the same situation,  the mind would first form a just estimate of the magnificence of the  building, and then be trebly impressed with the size of the masses which  overwhelmed it. The architecture would not lose, and the crags would  gain, by the juxtaposition; but the cottage, which must be felt to be a  thing which the weakest stream of the Alps could toss down before it  like a foam-globe, is offensively contemptible: it is like a child's toy  let fall accidentally on the hillside; it does not unite with the scene;  it is not content to sink into a quiet corner, and personify humility  and peace; but it draws attention upon itself by its pretension to  decoration, while its decorations themselves cannot bear examination,  because they are useless, unmeaning and incongruous.    43. So much for its faults; and I have had no mercy upon them, the  rather, because I am always afraid of being biased in its favor by my  excessive love for its sweet nationality. Now for its beauties. Wherever  it is found, it always suggests ideas of a gentle, pure, and pastoral  life.[6] One feels that the peasants whose hands carved the planks so  neatly, and adorned their cottage so industriously, and still preserve  it so perfectly, and so neatly, can be no dull, drunken, lazy boors; one  feels, also, that it requires both firm resolution, and determined  industry, to maintain so successful a struggle against \"the crush of  thunder, and the warring winds.\" Sweet ideas float over the imagination  of such passages of peasant life as the gentle Walton so loved; of the  full milk-pail, and the mantling cream-bowl; of the evening dance and  the matin song; of the herdsmen on the Alps, of the maidens by the  fountain; of all that is peculiarly and indisputably Swiss. For the  cottage is beautifully national; there is nothing to be found the least  like it in any other country. The moment a glimpse is caught of its  projecting galleries, one knows that it is the land of Tell and  Winkelried; and the traveler feels, that, were he indeed Swiss-born and  Alp-bred, a bit of that carved plank, meeting his eye in a foreign land,  would be as effectual as a note of the _Ranz des Vaches_ upon the ear.    [Footnote 6: Compare _Modern Painters_, vol. iv. chap. xi, and vol. v.  chap. ix.]    44. Again, when a number of these cottages are grouped together, they  break upon each other's formality, and form a mass of fantastic  proportion, of carved window and overhanging roof, full of character and  picturesque in the extreme. An excellent example of this is the Bernese  village of Unterseen. Again, when the ornament is not very elaborate,  yet enough to preserve the character, and the cottage is old, and not  very well kept (suppose in a Catholic canton), and a little rotten, the  effect is beautiful: the timber becomes weather-stained, and of a fine  warm brown, harmonizing delightfully with the gray stones on the roof,  and the dark green of surrounding pines. If it be fortunate enough to be  situated in some quiet glen, out of sight of the gigantic features of  the scene, and surrounded with cliffs to which it bears some proportion;  and if it be partially concealed, not intruding on the eye, but well  united with everything around, it becomes altogether perfect; humble,  beautiful, and interesting. Perhaps no cottage can then be found to  equal it; and none can be more finished in effect, graceful in detail,  and characteristic as a whole.    45. The ornaments employed in the decoration of the Swiss cottage do not  demand much attention; they are usually formed in a most simple manner,  by thin laths, which are carved into any fanciful form, or in which rows  of holes are cut, generally diamond shaped; and they are then nailed one  above another to give the carving depth. Pinnacles are never raised on  the roof, though carved spikes are occasionally suspended from it at  the angles. No ornamental work is ever employed to disguise the beams of  the projecting part of the roof, nor does any run along its edges. The  galleries, in the canton of Uri, are occasionally supported on arched  beams, as shown in Fig. 4, which have a very pleasing effect.    [Illustration: Swiss Chalet Balcony, 1842.]    46. Of the adaptation of the building to climate and character, little  can be said. When I called it \"national,\" I meant only that it was quite  _sui generis_, and, therefore, being only found in Switzerland, might be  considered as a national building; though it has none of the mysterious  connection with the mind of its inhabitants which is evident in all  really fine edifices. But there is a reason for this; Switzerland has no  climate, properly speaking, but an assemblage of every climate, from  Italy to the Pole; the vine wild in its valleys, the ice eternal on its  crags. The Swiss themselves are what we might have expected in persons  dwelling in such a climate; they have no character. The sluggish nature  of the air of the valleys has a malignant operation on the mind; and  even the mountaineers, though generally shrewd and intellectual, have no  perceptible nationality: they have no language, except a mixture of  Italian and bad German; they have no peculiar turn of mind; they might  be taken as easily for Germans as for Swiss. No correspondence,  consequently, can exist between national architecture and national  character, where the latter is not distinguishable. Generally speaking,  then, the Swiss cottage cannot be said to be built in good taste; but it  is occasionally picturesque, frequently pleasing, and, under a favorable  concurrence of circumstances, beautiful. It is not, however, a thing to  be imitated; it is always, when out of its own country, incongruous; it  never harmonizes with anything around it, and can therefore be employed  only in mimicry of what does not exist, not in improvement of what does.  I mean, that any one who has on his estate a dingle shaded with larches  or pines, with a rapid stream, may manufacture a bit of Switzerland as a  toy; but such imitations are always contemptible, and he cannot use the  Swiss cottage in any other way. A modified form of it, however, as will  be hereafter shown, may be employed with advantage. I hope, in my next  paper, to derive more satisfaction from the contemplation of the  mountain cottage of Westmoreland, than I have been able to obtain from  that of the Swiss.          IV.    THE MOUNTAIN COTTAGE--WESTMORELAND.      47. When I devoted so much time to the consideration of the  peculiarities of the Swiss cottage, I did not previously endeavor to  ascertain what the mind, influenced by the feelings excited by the  nature of its situation, would be induced to expect, or disposed to  admire. I thus deviated from the general rule which I hope to be able to  follow out; but I did so only because the subject for consideration was  incapable of fulfilling the expectation when excited, or corresponding  with the conception when formed. But now, in order to appreciate the  beauty of the Westmoreland cottage, it will be necessary to fix upon a  standard of excellence, with which it may be compared.    One of the principal charms of mountain scenery is its solitude. Now,  just as silence is never perfect or deep without motion, solitude is  never perfect without some vestige of life. Even desolation is not felt  to be utter, unless in some slight degree interrupted: unless the  cricket is chirping on the lonely hearth, or the vulture soaring over  the field of corpses, or the one mourner lamenting over the red ruins of  the devastated village, that devastation is not felt to be complete. The  anathema of the prophet does not wholly leave the curse of loneliness  upon the mighty city, until he tells us that \"the satyr shall dance  there.\" And, if desolation, which is the destruction of life, cannot  leave its impression perfect without some interruption, much less can  solitude, which is only the absence of life, be felt without some  contrast. Accordingly, it is, perhaps, never so perfect as when a  populous and highly cultivated plain, immediately beneath, is visible  through the rugged ravines, or over the cloudy summits of some tall,  vast, and"]]]
