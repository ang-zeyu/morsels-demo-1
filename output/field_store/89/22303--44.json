Ketboga called upon El-Ashraf's Mamluks to take vengeance, pursued the  rebels, and killed Baidara. He then returned to Cairo, and, after long  negotiations with the governor of the capital, Muhammed, a younger  brother of El-Ashraf, was proclaimed sultan, with the title of El-Malik  en-Nasir.    Muhammed en-Nasir occupies such an important place in the history of  these times that the other Moslem princes may easily be grouped around  him. He was only nine years old when he was summoned to be ruler of the  kingdom of the Mamluks. Naturally he was the sultan only in name, and  the real power lay in the hands of Ketboga and Vizier Shujai. These two  lived in perfect harmony so long as they were merely occupied with  the pursuit of their rivals,--not only the friends and followers of  El-Ashraf's murderer, but also the innocent ex-vizier of El-Ashraf,  because he had treated them with contempt and was in possession of  riches for which they were greedy. He shared the fate of the king's  assassins, for, in spite of the intercession of the ladies of the royal  harem, he ended his life on the gallows. But as soon as the two rulers  had got rid of their enemies and appeased their own avarice, their  peaceful union was at an end, for each wished to have complete control  over the sultan. Shujai had the Mamluks of the late sultan on his side;  while Ketboga, who was a Mongol by birth, had with him all the Mongols  and Kurds who had settled in the kingdom during Beybars' reign. A Mongol  warned Ketboga against Shujai, who had made all necessary preparations  to throw his rival into prison, and he immediately was attacked by  Ketboga and defeated after several attempts.    Ketboga's ambition was not yet fulfilled, although he was now supreme  ruler. He first demanded homage as regent; as he met with no opposition,  he conceived the idea of setting the sultan, Nasir, aside; and he hoped  to carry out his plan with the assistance of Lajin and Kara Sonkor,  El-Ashraf's murderers, and their numerous following. He had the pardon  of these two emirs proclaimed, whereupon they left their hiding-places  and joined Ketboga, for it was to their interest also that the sultan  should be put out of the way. This _coup d'etat_ was a complete success  (December, 1294), but in spite of these plans, Ketboga's reign was both  unfortunate and brief. The old emirs were vexed with him because he  raised his own Mamluks to the highest posts of honour, and the clergy  were displeased because he received favourably a number of Mongols,  although they were heathens. The people blamed him for the severe famine  which visited Egypt and Syria and which was followed by a terrible  pestilence. Several emirs, with Lajin again at their head, conspired  against him, and forced their way into his tent while he was on the way  to Syria; overpowering the guard, they attempted to get possession of  his person. He managed to escape, however, and so saved his life and  liberty, but Lajin obtained possession of the throne, with the agreement  of the other emirs. In spite of his advantages, both as man and as pious  Moslem, and in spite of his brilliant victories over the princes of  Armenia, Lajin was murdered, together with his successor, and Nasir, who  was then living in Kerak, was recalled as sultan (January, 1299).    Nasir was still too young to reign alone; he had to let himself be  ruled by the emirs who had already assumed a kind of regency before his  return. At the head of these emirs stood Sellar and Beybars Jashingir.  Distrust and uneasiness existed between these two, one of whom was  regent and the other prefect of the palace, for each wanted to assume  the chief power; but soon their private intrigues were put into the  background by a common danger. The Ilkhan Gazan was actively preparing  for war against the Mamluk kingdom because the Governor of Aleppo  had fallen upon Mardin, a town belonging to the Mongols, and brutally  maltreated the inhabitants; also because the refugees from Egypt and  Syria assured him that the moment was favourable for extending his  dominion over these lands.    The internal history of Egypt at this period offers nothing but tedious  strifes between different emirs, and specially between the two most  powerful, Beybars and Sellar, who would have often brought it to open  warfare had not their friends and followers intervened. They agreed,  however, on one point, namely, to keep the sultan as long as possible  from taking over the reins of government, and to keep him as secluded  as possible in order to deprive him of all influence. Whilst Sellar  was wasting immense sums, the sultan was in fact almost starving. When  Sellar went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, he paid the debts of all the  Moslems who had retired to this town; he further distributed ten  thousand malters of fruit amongst the poor people in the town, and so  much money and provisions that they were able to live on it for a whole  year. He also treated the inhabitants of Medina and Jiddah in an equally  generous way. The sultan, who was hunting in Lower Egypt, at the  same time tried in vain to obtain a small loan from the Alexandrian  merchants, to buy a present for his wife. Finally, his vizier, who had  granted him two thousand dinars ($5,060), was accused on Sellar's return  of embezzling the public money, was led round the town on a donkey, and  beaten and tortured so long that he succumbed under his torments.    In the year 1307, when Nasir was twenty-three years old, though still  treated as a child, he attempted, with the help of the Emir Bektimur,  who commanded the Mamluks in the palace, to seize the persons of his  oppressors. The plan failed, for they had their spies everywhere, and  the only result was that the sultan's faithful servants were banished to  Syria, and the sultan himself was more oppressed than ever. It was two  years before he succeeded in deceiving his tyrants. He expressed the  wish to make a pilgrimage to Mecca; this was granted, as the emirs saw  nothing dangerous in it, and, moreover, as a religious duty, it could  not be resisted. As soon as he reached the fortress Kerak, with the  help of those soldiers in his escort who were devoted to his cause,  and having deceived the governor by means of false letters, he obtained  possession of the fortress, and immediately declared his independence of  the guardianship of Sellar and Beybars. Sellar and Beybars, on hearing  this, immediately summoned the sultan to return to Cairo; but, even  before they received his answer, they realised that their rule was over,  and that either they must quit the field, or Nasir must be dethroned.  After long consideration amongst themselves, they proceeded to the  choice of another sultan, and the choice fell on Beybars (April, 1309).  Beybars accepted the proffered throne on the condition that Sellar also  retained his place. He confirmed the other emirs also in their offices,  hoping thereby to gain their support.    [Illustration: 049.jpg INTERIOR OF THE MOSQUE, KILAWUN]    The change of government met with no resistance in Egypt, where the  majority of the emirs had long been dependent on Beybars and Sellar.  In Syria, on the other hand, the emirs acting as governors refused to  acknowledge Beybars, partly from devotion to Nasir's race, and partly  because the choice had been made without their consent. Only Akush,  Governor of Damascus, who was an old friend of Beybars, and like him a  Circassian, took the oath of allegiance. The governors of Aleppo, Hamah,  and Tripoli, together with the governors of Safed and Jerusalem, called  upon Nasir to join them, and, with the help of his other followers,  to reconquer Egypt. The cunning sultan, who saw that the time for open  resistance had not yet arrived, since Egypt was as yet too unanimous,  and Damascus also had joined the enemy, advised them to deceive Beybars  and to take the oath of allegiance, which they could break later, as  having been obtained by force. He himself feigned to submit to the new  government, and even had the prayers carried on from the chancel in  Beybars' name. Beybars was deceived, although he knew with certainty  that Nasir carried on a lively intercourse with the discontented  emirs. He relied chiefly on Akush, who kept a strict watch over Nasir's  movements. The spies of Akush, however, were open to corruption, and  they failed later to take steps to render Nasir harmless at the right  moment. Beybars believed Nasir to be still in Kerak, when he was well  on the way to Damascus; and when he finally received news of this, the  rebellion had already gone so far that some of the troops who had been  sent out against the sultan had already deserted to his side. The only  possible way of allaying the storm was for Beybars to put himself at the  head of his troops, and, joining forces with Akush, to offer battle  to Nasir. The necessary courage and resolution failed him. Instead of  having recourse to the sword, he applied to the caliph, who declared  Nasir an exile, and summoned all believers to listen to the Sultan  Beybars--whom he had consecrated--and to take part in the war against  the rebel, Nasir. But the summons of the caliph, which was read in all  the chancels, had not the slightest effect. The belief in the caliph had  long disappeared, except in so far as he was considered a tool of the  sultan on whom he depended. Even Beybars' party mocked the caliph's  declaration, and wherever it was read manifestations were made in favour  of the exile. Beybars, also, was now deserted by Sellar, and he at  length was obliged to resign. Beybars was then seized and throttled by  Nasir, and Sellar was starved to death.    Nasir, who now came to the throne, had grown suspicious and treacherous  on account of the many hardships and betrayals endured by him during  his youth. He was, however, favourable to the Christians, and to such an  extent that he received"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17334"],[0,"Initiative Psychic Energy (#7)"],[1,"of effort, is essential to success.    _But in the past the world has possessed no formula by which these  qualities might be acquired_.
