It was probably  the predecessor of the Arab canon, which again is much the same as the  santir. (See Fig. 25.)    There were two kinds of flute, both of them reed pipes, the smaller  being merely a shepherd's pipe. They were used for lamentations and  for certain festivals, as in Isaiah xxx, 29: \"Ye shall have a song as  in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart as  when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord, the  Holy One of Israel.\"    Many of the different names of musical instruments in the common  version of the Scriptures are merely blunders of the Septuagint  translators, who rendered the word kinnor by about six different  terms, where no distinction had been originally intended by the sacred  writers.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    Among the Hebrews we find the same progression from men alone as  musicians to women almost exclusively, and it is likely that the  Hebrews gained the idea from Egypt. Jubal was the discoverer of the  harp, according to the tradition in Genesis, and David manifested no  loss of manliness while playing before the Lord. Nevertheless when he  sang and danced before the ark his wife despised him in her heart.  Miriam, the sister of Moses, may well have been a professional  musician, one of the singing and dancing women, such as are  represented over and over again in the monuments. In the time of  Moses, and for some time later, women had no status in the public  service; but in the later days of the second temple the women singers  are an important element of the display. Ezra and Nehemiah speak of  them, and the son of Sirach, in the Apocrypha, recommends the reader  to \"beware of female singers, that they entice thee not with their  charms.\"    According to the views of many writers, the Hebrews had a larger harp  than the small one represented in Fig. 8. It may have been something  like one which was found in Egypt, but the form is clearly Assyrian,  belonging to the same type as the small harps already given. It  certainly is not Egyptian. (See Fig. 9.)    The liturgy of the temple must have been singularly noble and  imposing. Never had a church so grand a body of poetry as this of the  Hebrews, which they heard in the very sonorous words of David, Moses,  Isaiah and Ezekiel, with all the subtle suggestion of a vernacular as  employed by minds of the first poetic order. The Hebrew parallelism  afforded exactly the kind of formula in which one congregation could  most effectively respond to another.         \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof;       The world and they that dwell therein;       For He hath founded it upon the seas,       And established it upon the floods.       Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?       And who shall stand in His holy place?\"    When the priests had intoned one line, we may suppose that the whole  choir of Levites made answer in the second line, completing the  parallelism.    There are other psalms in which the people have a refrain which comes  in periodically, as, for instance, in the one: \"O give thanks unto  the Lord; [refrain] for His mercy endureth forever.\" (Ps. cxxxvi.)    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    The voice of these masses stood to the Hebrews' mind as the feeble  type of the great song which should go up from the entire Israel of  God when the scattered members of the cult were gathered in their time  of fullness and glory. For us also the same image stands. And while  the art of this venerable and singularly gifted people did not attain  a place of commanding influence upon the tonal side of music, it  nevertheless has borne no small part in affording a vantage ground for  later art in the line of noble conceptions, inspiring motives and  brilliant suggestions. It has been, and still is, one of the most  potent influences in the art-music of the world. Nor is it without  interest that the scattered representatives of this race have been  and continue to be ministers of art in all the lands into which they  have come. The race of Israel has made a proud record in modern music,  no less than that of the ancient temple.      II.    The Assyrians held music in honor, and employed it for liturgical  purposes, as well as those of social and private life. Among the  discoveries at Nineveh and Babylon are many of a musical character.  Strong bearded men are playing upon harps which are of a triangular  form, but of a different structure to any which we have thus far  given. (See Fig. 10.)    The one upon the left is a eunuch. In the following figure we have the  banjo-like instrument so constantly seen in the Egyptian  representations.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    There are several instances of some sort of an instrument, apparently  consisting of metallic plates or rods, played by means of a hammer.  Many have considered these to have been the original type of the  modern instruments of percussion, where metal plates are vibrated by  means of hammers or mallets. The following is one of this kind.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    The general appearance of these processions indicates that the  Assyrians were in the habit of massing a large number of players upon  important occasions. We have no idea what the effect of this music can  have been, but upon the tonal side it cannot have had any great  resonance or power. Enough if it satisfied the ears of the dignified  players and those who employed their services as a part of the pageant  of their great festivals.          CHAPTER III.    MUSIC AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEKS.      Upon several accounts the development of the art of music among the  ancient Greeks is both important and interesting. Our word \"music\" is  theirs; it carries within its etymology the derivation from the Muses,  the nine agreeable divinities who presided over the more becoming and  nobler activities of the Greek mind. By music the Greeks meant much  more than merely the tonal art itself. Under this term they included  pretty much all that they had of a liberal education; grammar,  history, rhetoric, mathematics, poetry and song--all were included in  this one elastic and comprehensive term. Music itself, the art of  tone-sequence, they called harmony.    Our information concerning the general course of the development of  music among this people is pretty accurate through a period of about  1300 years. The entire course of the Greek history of music may be  divided into four great divisions, each of which was principally  devoted to a certain part of the art. These divisions begin at a date  which we might take approximately at about 1000 B.C., when the Homeric  poems began to be chanted or sung by traveling minstrels called  Rhapsodists. The schools of rhapsodies lasted for about 250 years,  when choral and patriotic song began to be developed. In connection  with this part of the history, there was in the later portion of it a  more ornamental and fanciful development of the smaller and social  uses of song, represented by Sappho, Anacreon and others. This period  endured for about two centuries and a half, and by insensible degrees  passed into the Attic drama, which came to its maturity at the hands  of AEschylus, Sophocles and Euripides about 450 B.C.    Here was the culmination of Greek musical art upon the purely artistic  and aesthetic side. Then followed a period of philosophizing, theory  and mathematical deduction, which extended to the end of the  Alexandrian schools, about 300 A.D. The limits of the present work do  not permit tracing this course of progress with the amplitude which  its relation to liberal education would otherwise warrant, or even to  the extent which its bearing upon the present ideals of the tonal art  would justify, were not the range of subjects indispensable to even a  summarized treatment of musical history so wide as it has now become.  But the general features of the different steps in the Greek music are  the following:    As already noticed, the earliest traces of music are those in the  Homeric poems, which are thought to have been composed about 1000 B.C.  In these we find the minstrel everywhere a central figure, an honored  guest, ready at call to entertain the company with some ballad of the  ancient times, or to improvise a new one appropriate to the case in  hand. The heroes themselves were not loth to take part in these  exercises. Ulysses, the Odyssey tells us, occasionally took the lyre  in his own hand and sang a rhapsody of his own adventures. Several  centuries later, Solon, one of the famed seven wise men of Greece,  composed the rhapsody of \"Salamis, or the Lost Island,\" and sang it in  a public assembly of the Athenians with so much effect that an  expedition was organized, with Solon at its head, for its recovery,  which presently followed triumphantly.    Many passages in the Odyssey will occur to the classical reader in  illustration of the position of the minstrel in Argos in the earlier  times. For example (Odyssey I, 400, Bryant's translation):                                         \"Silent all       They sat and listened to the illustrious bard       Who sang of the calamitous return       Of the Greek host from Troy, at the command       Of Pallas. From her chamber o'er the hall       The daughter of Icarius, the sage queen       Penelope, had heard the heavenly strain,       And knew its theme. Down by the lofty stairs       She came, but not alone; there followed her       Two maidens. When the glorious lady reached       The threshold of the strong-built hall, where sat       The suitors, holding up a delicate veil       Before her face, and with a gush of tears,       The queen bespake the sacred minstrel thus:       'Phemius, thou knowest many a pleasing theme--       The deeds of gods and heroes, such as bards       Are wont to celebrate. Take, then, thy place,       And sing of one of these, and let the guests       In silence drink the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#7)"],[1,"1) See Hilprecht, _Explorations in Bible Lands_, pp. 289       ff., 540 ff.; and Fisher, _Excavations at Nippur_, Pt.

Montgomery, _Aramaic Incantation Texts from       Nippur_, 1913         (5) Hilprecht, _Explorations_, p. 555 f.    Of the many thousands of inscribed clay tablets which were found in  the course of the expeditions, some were kept at Constantinople, while  others were presented by the Sultan Abdul Hamid to the excavators, who  had them conveyed to America. Since that time a large number have been  published. The work was necessarily slow, for many of the texts were  found to be in an extremely bad state of preservation. So it happened  that a great number of the boxes containing tablets remained until  recently still packed up in the store-rooms of the Pennsylvania Museum.  But under the present energetic Director of the Museum, Dr. G. B.  Gordon, the process of arranging and publishing the mass of literary  material has been \"speeded up\". A staff of skilled workmen has been  employed on the laborious task of cleaning the broken tablets and  fitting the fragments together. At the same time the help of several  Assyriologists was welcomed in the further task of running over and  sorting the collections as they were prepared for study. Professor Clay,  Professor Barton, Dr. Langdon, Dr. Edward Chiera, and Dr. Arno Poebel  have all participated in the work. But the lion's share has fallen to  the last-named scholar, who was given leave of absence by John  Hopkins University in order to take up a temporary appointment at the  Pennsylvania Museum. The result of his labours was published by the  Museum at the end of 1914.(1) The texts thus made available for study  are of very varied interest. A great body of them are grammatical  and represent compilations made by Semitic scribes of the period  of Hammurabi's dynasty for their study of the old Sumerian tongue.  Containing, as most of them do, Semitic renderings of the Sumerian words  and expressions collected, they are as great a help to us in our study  of Sumerian language as they were to their compilers; in particular they  have thrown much new light on the paradigms of the demonstrative and  personal pronouns and on Sumerian verbal forms. But literary texts are  also included in the recent publications.         (1) Poebel, _Historical Texts_ and _Historical and       Grammatical Texts_ (Univ. of Penns. Mus. Publ., Bab. Sect.,       Vol. IV, No. 1, and Vol. V), Philadelphia, 1914.    When the Pennsylvania Museum sent out its first expedition, lively hopes  were entertained that the site selected would yield material of interest  from the biblical standpoint. The city of Nippur, as we have seen,  was one of the most sacred and most ancient religious centres in  the country, and Enlil, its city-god, was the head of the Babylonian  pantheon. On such a site it seemed likely that we might find versions of  the Babylonian legends which were current at the dawn of history before  the city of Babylonia and its Semitic inhabitants came upon the scene.  This expectation has proved to be not unfounded, for the literary  texts include the Sumerian Deluge Version and Creation myth to which I  referred at the beginning of the lecture. Other texts of almost equal  interest consist of early though fragmentary lists of historical and  semi-mythical rulers. They prove that Berossus and the later Babylonians  depended on material of quite early origin in compiling their dynasties  of semi-mythical kings. In them we obtain a glimpse of ages more remote  than any on which excavation in Babylonia has yet thrown light, and for  the first time we have recovered genuine native tradition of early date  with regard to the cradle of Babylonian culture. Before we approach the  Sumerian legends themselves, it will be as well to-day to trace back  in this tradition the gradual merging of history into legend and myth,  comparing at the same time the ancient Egyptian's picture of his own  remote past. We will also ascertain whether any new light is thrown by  our inquiry upon Hebrew traditions concerning the earliest history of  the human race and the origins of civilization.    In the study of both Egyptian and Babylonian chronology there has been a  tendency of late years to reduce the very early dates that were formerly  in fashion. But in Egypt, while the dynasties of Manetho have been  telescoped in places, excavation has thrown light on predynastic  periods, and we can now trace the history of culture in the Nile Valley  back, through an unbroken sequence, to its neolithic stage. Quite  recently, too, as I mentioned just now, a fresh literary record of  these early predynastic periods has been recovered, on a fragment of  the famous Palermo Stele, our most valuable monument for early Egyptian  history and chronology. Egypt presents a striking contrast to Babylonia  in the comparatively small number of written records which have survived  for the reconstruction of her history. We might well spare much of  her religious literature, enshrined in endless temple-inscriptions and  papyri, if we could but exchange it for some of the royal annals of  Egyptian Pharaohs. That historical records of this character were  compiled by the Egyptian scribes, and that they were as detailed and  precise in their information as those we have recovered from Assyrian  sources, is clear from the few extracts from the annals of Thothmes  III's wars which are engraved on the walls of the temple at Karnak.(1)  As in Babylonia and Assyria, such records must have formed the  foundation on which summaries of chronicles of past Egyptian history  were based. In the Palermo Stele it is recognized that we possess a  primitive chronicle of this character.         (1) See Breasted, _Ancient Records_, I, p. 4, II, pp. 163       ff.    Drawn up as early as the Vth Dynasty, its historical summary proves that  from the beginning of the dynastic age onward a yearly record was kept  of the most important achievements of the reigning Pharaoh. In this  fragmentary but invaluable epitome, recording in outline much of the  history of the Old Kingdom,(1) some interesting parallels have long been  noted with Babylonian usage. The early system of time-reckoning, for  example, was the same in both countries, each year being given an  official title from the chief event that occurred in it. And although in  Babylonia we are still without material for tracing the process by which  this cumbrous method gave place to that of reckoning by regnal years,  the Palermo Stele demonstrates the way in which the latter system was  evolved in Egypt. For the events from which the year was named came  gradually to be confined to the fiscal \"numberings\" of cattle and land.  And when these, which at first had taken place at comparatively long  intervals, had become annual events, the numbered sequence of their  occurrence corresponded precisely to the years of the king's reign. On  the stele, during the dynastic period, each regnal year is allotted its  own space or rectangle,(2) arranged in horizontal sequence below the  name and titles of the ruling king.    (1) Op. cit., I, pp. 57 ff.    (2) The spaces are not strictly rectangles, as each is divided  vertically from the next by the Egyptian hieroglyph for \"year\".    The text, which is engraved on both sides of a great block of black  basalt, takes its name from the fact that the fragment hitherto known  has been preserved since 1877 at the Museum of Palermo. Five other  fragments of the text have now been published, of which one undoubtedly  belongs to the same monument as the Palermo fragment, while the others  may represent parts of one or more duplicate copies of that famous text.  One of the four Cairo fragments(1) was found by a digger for _sebakh_  at Mitrahineh (Memphis); the other three, which were purchased from a  dealer, are said to have come from Minieh, while the fifth fragment,  at University College, is also said to have come from Upper Egypt,(2)  though it was purchased by Professor Petrie while at Memphis. These  reports suggest that a number of duplicate copies were engraved and set  up in different Egyptian towns, and it is possible that the whole of the  text may eventually be recovered. The choice of basalt for the records  was obviously dictated by a desire for their preservation, but it has  had the contrary effect; for the blocks of this hard and precious  stone have been cut up and reused in later times. The largest and  most interesting of the new fragments has evidently been employed as a  door-sill, with the result that its surface is much rubbed and parts of  its text are unfortunately almost undecipherable. We shall see that the  earliest section of its record has an important bearing on our knowledge  of Egyptian predynastic history and on the traditions of that remote  period which have come down to us from the history of Manetho.    (1) See Gautier, _Le Musee Egyptien_, III (1915), pp. 29 ff., pl.  xxiv ff., and Foucart, _Bulletin de l'Institut Francais d'Archeologie  Orientale_, XII, ii (1916), pp. 161 ff.; and cf. Gardiner, _Journ. of  Egypt. Arch._, III, pp. 143 ff., and Petrie, _Ancient Egypt_, 1916, Pt.  III, pp. 114 ff.    (2) Cf. Petrie, op. cit., pp. 115, 120.    From the fragment of the stele preserved at Palermo we already knew that  its record went back beyond the Ist Dynasty into predynastic times.  For part of the top band of the inscription, which is there preserved,  contains nine names borne by kings of Lower Egypt or the Delta, which,  it had been conjectured, must follow the gods of Manetho and precede  the \"Worshippers of Horus\", the immediate predecessors of the Egyptian  dynasties.(1) But of contemporary rulers of Upper Egypt we had hitherto  no knowledge, since the supposed "]]]
