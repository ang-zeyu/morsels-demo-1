An old bachelor has the best of  it in the main, I do believe. But oh, Jan van der Welde, what a donkey  you must be to get yourself mixed up in such a broil! and yet--ah!\"    The fossilised old gentleman broke off with a sigh as he recalled the  memory of a certain dead-and-gone romance which had happened--goodness  only knows how many years before--when he, like Jan van der Welde, would  have thrown the world away for a glance of a certain pair of blue eyes,  at the bidding of a certain English tongue, whose broken _Nederlandsche  taal_ was to him the sweetest music ever heard on earth--sweeter even  than the strains of the Stradivari when from under his skilful fingers  rose the perfect melodies of old masters. Ay, but the sweet eyes had  been closed in death many a long, long, year, the sweet voice hushed  in silence. He had watched the dear life ebb away, the fire in the  blue eyes fade out. He had felt each day that the clasp of the little  greeting fingers was less close; each day he had seen the outline of the  face grow sharper; and at last there had come one when the poor little  English-woman met him with the gaze of one who knew him not, and  babbled, not of green fields, but of horses and dogs, and of a brother  Jack, who, five years before, had gone down with her Majesty's ship  _Alligator_ in mid-Atlantic.    Ay, but that was many and many a year agone. His young, blue-eyed love  stood out alone in life's history, a thing apart. Of the gentler sex, in  a general way, the old professor had not seen that which had raised it  in his estimation to the level of the one woman over whose memory hung a  bright halo of romance.      Fifteen years had passed away; the old professor of osteology had passed  away with them; and in the large house on the Domplein lived a baron,  with half a dozen noisy, happy, healthy children,--young _fraulas_ and  _jonkheers_,--who scampered up and down the marble passages, and fell  headlong down the steep, narrow, unlighted stairways, to the imminent  danger of dislocating their aristocratic little necks. There was a new  race of neat maids, clad in the same neat livery of lilac and black,  who scoured and cleaned, just as Koosje and Dortje had done in the  old professor's day. You might, indeed, have heard the selfsame names  resounding through the echoing rooms: \"Koos-je! Dort-je!\"    But the Koosje and Dortje were not the same. What had become of Dortje I  cannot say; but on the left-hand side of the busy, bustling, picturesque  Oude Gracht there was a handsome shop filled with all manner of cakes,  sweeties, confections, and liquors--from absinthe to Benedictine,  or arrack to chartreuse. In that shop was a handsome, prosperous,  middle-aged woman, well dressed and well mannered, no longer Professor  van Dijck's Koosje, but the Jevrouw van Kampen.    Yes; Koosje had come to be a prosperous tradeswoman of good position,  respected by all. But she was Koosje van Kampen still; the romance which  had come to so disastrous and abrupt an end had sufficed for her life.  Many an offer had been made to her, it is true; but she had always  declared that she had had enough of lovers--she had found out their real  value.    I must tell you that at the time of Jan's infidelity, after the first  flush of rage was over, Koosje disdained to show any sign of grief or  regret. She was very proud, this Netherland servant-maid, far too proud  to let those by whom she was surrounded imagine she was wearing the  willow for the faithless Jan; and when Dortje, on the day of the  wedding, remarked that for her part she had always considered Koosje  remarkably cool on the subject of matrimony, Koosje with a careless  out-turning of her hands, palms uppermost, answered that she was right.    Very soon after their marriage Jan and his young wife left Utrecht for  Arnheim, where Jan had promise of higher wages; and thus they passed, as  Koosje thought, completely out of her life.    \"I don't wish to hear anything more about them, if--you--please,\" she  said, severely and emphatically, to Dortje.    But not so. In time the professor died, leaving Koosje the large legacy  with which she set up the handsome shop in the Oude Gracht; and several  years passed on.    It happened one day that Koosje was sitting in her shop sewing. In the  large inner room a party of ladies and officers were eating cakes and  drinking chocolates and liquors with a good deal of fun and laughter,  when the door opened timidly, thereby letting in a gust of bitter wind,  and a woman crept fearfully in, followed by two small, crying children.    Could the lady give her something to eat? she asked; they had had  nothing during the day, and the little ones were almost famished.    Koosje, who was very charitable, lifted a tray of large, plain buns, and  was about to give her some, when her eyes fell upon the poor beggar's  faded face, and she exclaimed:    \"Truide!\"    Truide, for it was she, looked up in startled surprise.    \"I did not know, or I would not have come in, Koosje,\" she said, humbly;  \"for I treated you very badly.\"    \"Ve-ry bad-ly,\" returned Koosje, emphatically. \"Then where is Jan?\"    \"Dead!\" murmured Truide, sadly.    \"Dead! so--ah, well! I suppose I must do something for you. Here Yanke!\"  opening the door and calling, \"Yanke!\"    \"_Je, jevrouw_,\" a voice cried, in reply.    The next moment a maid came running into the shop.    \"Take these people into the kitchen and give them something to eat.  Put them by the stove while you prepare it. There is some soup and that  smoked ham we had for _koffy_. Then come here and take my place for a  while.\"    \"_Je, jevrouw_,\" said Yanke, disappearing again, followed by Truide and  her children.    Then Koosje sat down again, and began to think.    \"I said,\" she mused, presently, \"_that_ night that the next time I  fell over a bundle I'd leave it where I found it. Ah, well! I'm not  a barbarian; I couldn't do that. I never thought, though, it would be  Truide.\"    \"_Hi, jevrouw_,\" was called from the inner room.    \"_Je, mynheer_,\" jumping up and going to her customers.    She attended to their wants, and presently bowed them out.    \"I never thought it would be Truide,\" she repeated to herself, as  she closed the door behind the last of the gay uniforms and jingling  scabbards. \"And Jan is dead--ah, well!\"    Then she went into the kitchen, where the miserable children--girls both  of them, and pretty had they been clean and less forlornly clad--were  playing about the stove.    \"So Jan is dead,\" began Koosje, seating herself.    \"Yes, Jan is dead,\" Truide answered.    \"And he left you nothing?\" Koosje asked.    \"We had had nothing for a long time,\" Truide replied, in her sad,  crushed voice. \"We didn't get on very well; he soon got tired of me.\"    \"That was a weakness of his,\" remarked Koosje, drily.    \"We lost five little ones, one after another,\" Truide continued. \"And  Jan was fond of them, and somehow it seemed to sour him. As for me, I  was sorry enough at the time, Heaven knows, but it was as well. But Jan  said it seemed as if a curse had fallen upon us; he began to wish you  back again, and to blame me for having come between you. And then he  took to _genever_, and then to wish for something stronger; so at last  every stiver went for absinthe, and once or twice he beat me, and then  he died.\"    \"Just as well,\" muttered Koosje, under her breath.    \"It is very good of you to have fed and warmed us,\" Truide went on, in  her faint, complaining tones. \"Many a one would have let me starve, and  I should have deserved it. It is very good of you and we are grateful;  but 'tis time we were going, Koosje and Mina;\" then added, with a shake  of her head, \"but I don't know where.\"    \"Oh, you'd better stay,\" said Koosje, hurriedly. \"I live in this big  house by myself, and I dare say you'll be more useful in the shop than  Yanke--if your tongue is as glib as it used to be, that is. You know  some English, too, don't you?\"    \"A little,\" Truide answered, eagerly.    \"And after all,\" Koosje said, philosophically, shrugging her shoulders,  \"you saved me from the beatings and the starvings and the rest. I owe  you something for that. Why, if it hadn't been for you I should have  been silly enough to have married him.\"    And then she went back to her shop, saying to herself:    \"The professor said it was a blessing in disguise; God sends all our  trials to work some great purpose. Yes; that was what he said, and he  knew most things. Just think if I were trailing about now with those  two little ones, with nothing to look back to but a schnapps-drinking  husband who beat me! Ah, well, well! things are best as they are. I  don't know that I ought not to be very much obliged to her--and she'll  be very useful in the shop.\"          A DOG OF FLANDERS, by Ouida      Nello and Patrasche were left all alone in the world.    They were friends in a friendship closer than brotherhood. Nello was  a little Ardennois; Patrasche was a big Fleming. They were both of the  same age by length of years; yet one was still young, and the other was  already old. They had dwelt together almost all their days; both were  orphaned and destitute, and owed their lives to the same hand. It  had been the beginning of the tie between them,--their first bond of  sympathy,--and it had strengthened day by day, and had grown with  their growth, firm and indissoluble, until they loved one another very  greatly.    Their home was a little hut on the edge of a little village--a Flemish  village a league from Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths of pasture and  corn-lands, with long lines of poplars and of alders bending in the  breeze on the edge of the great canal which ran through it. It had about  a score of houses and homesteads, with shutters of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#7)"],[1,"comfortable and well furnished, and  everything as it should be.    \"She asked questions. I told her enough to interest her; and said  that, when the time came, it was hoped that he would be able to  obtain employment under the Government--perhaps in the army, as his  father had been. I said that those who brought him up were ready to  make great sacrifices for his sake, but that they could not pay for  him for more than two years; and that, as the boy knew so much  English, they hoped this would be enough. I asked how much, if she  agreed to take him, she would charge. She said that she would think  it over; and would call here, tomorrow, and tell me whether she  would take him.    \"She will be here at three. I think you had better come at that  hour. I am sure that she would like to speak to you. I do not see  why you should not say that you had been his ayah, and had saved  his life, and brought him up. Many officers have been killed and,  indeed, I do not see why you should not tell her the whole story.  It will interest her more in the boy. But of course, before you  tell her, you must ask her to promise not to repeat it.\"    Soyera went on the following day. She found that Jeemajee was  already, with a lady, in his private room. She waited until the  door was opened, and the merchant beckoned her in.    \"This is the woman who has brought the child up, Mrs. Sankey,\" he  said. \"As I have told you, she was his ayah, and has behaved most  nobly.\"    Turning to Soyera, he said:    \"Naturally Mrs. Sankey asked why you had not come forward before. I  told her your reasons, and she thinks that, perhaps, you have acted  for the best for him. At any rate, she has consented to take the  boy for two years; and I am to pay her, for you, the sum that you  have named.\"    In reality, Mrs. Sankey asked a thousand rupees a year; but the  Parsee, with the generosity for which his race is distinguished,  had agreed to pay the extra three hundred rupees himself.    \"Before it is quite settled,\" Mrs. Sankey said, \"I should like to  see the boy. As Mr. Jeemajee has told you, I have two daughters  about the same age. I must, therefore, be guided in my decision by  my impression of him.\"    \"I will bring him to see you, in three or four days,\" Soyera said.  \"His stain is already faded a good deal, and I shall be able to get  it off, by that time. I have to get English clothes for him.    \"I am greatly obliged to you for saying that you will take him, if  he pleases you. That I think he will do. I have taught him manners,  as well as I could. He is as anxious as I am to improve himself;  and will, I am sure, give you no more trouble than he can help.\"    \"I will see that he is properly clothed, Mrs. Sankey,\" Jeemajee  remarked. \"I knew his father, and have a great interest in him.\"    Mrs. Sankey chatted for some little time to Soyera; gave her her  card, with her address on Malabar Hill; and then left.    Soyera began to thank the Parsee for his introduction, but he said:    \"It was a little thing to do and, as I knew his father, it was only  right that I should help, as far as I could. Will you bring me,  tomorrow morning, the measurement of the boy's height, size around  his shoulders and waist, the lengths of his arms and legs? You need  trouble yourself no further about it. I shall take that matter upon  myself. Come, three days later, for his clothes.    \"Goodbye! I have other matters to see about,\" and, without waiting  for any thanks from Soyera, he at once went into his shop, and  began to talk to his assistant.    Many were the scrubbings Harry had to undergo, during the next few  days; and his hair and face were nearly restored to their proper  colour when Soyera returned, one evening, with a coolie carrying a  trunk of some size. It contained the whole outfit for a boy: one  dark suit, and four of white nankeen; with a stock of shirts,  underclothing, and shoes. Soyera showed Harry how these garments,  with which he was wholly unacquainted, should be put on.    \"They fit you capitally,\" she said, when she surveyed him. \"And you  look like a little English sahib.\"    \"They feel very tight and uncomfortable,\" he said.    \"They are sure to do so, at first; but you will soon get over that.  Now, Ramdass will take you out for a walk for two or three hours,  so that you can get accustomed to them. I should not like you to  look awkward, when you go with me to Mrs. Sankey's, tomorrow.\"    The interview next day was altogether satisfactory. The carriage  and bearing of the natives of India is easier, and more graceful,  than that of Europeans; and the knowledge Harry had possessed, for  some years, that he belonged to a conquering race, the injunctions  of Soyera, his strength and activity, and his unquestioned  leadership among the boys with whom he played, had given something  of confidence to his manner. Mrs. Sankey was greatly taken with  him, and he at once became an inmate of her house.    He remained there for two years, and became so great a favourite  that Mrs. Sankey insisted on his staying with her, without charge,  for three or four months after the time for which she had received  payment for him. He had worked hard and earnestly, and now spoke  English as well and accurately as any English boy of his own age.  He had, after being there a year, made the acquaintance of several  boys of his own age, the sons of officers or officials. They knew  him only as the orphan son of an English gentleman, in Government  employ; and he was often asked to the houses of their parents, and  none suspected that he had been brought up among natives.    At the end of his term, Sufder came down for him. Jeemajee, who had  remained his steady friend, arranged that he should go to his  house, and there resume his native dress and stain. In this garb he  felt even stranger and more uncomfortable than he had done, when he  first put on European clothes; but this was not long in wearing off  and, by the time he reached Jooneer, he was again at home in it. He  took with him, at Mrs. Sankey's suggestion, a number of English  books, by authors she recommended; so that he could, by reading and  learning some of them by heart, retain his knowledge of the  language.    For the next three months he spent his whole time in practising  with sword, pistol, and gun; under the tuition of an old soldier in  Jooneer, who had been a noted swordsman in his time. He was already  far stronger than the sons of Ramdass, although these were now  young men. Anxious to, at once, exercise his muscles and gain in  skill, he now attached himself to a famous shikaree who, seeing the  boy's strength and courage, took him as an assistant when he went  on excursions among the hills. Here Harry learned to dig pits for  the capture of tigers; to smear leaves with a sticky substance,  obtained from a plant resembling mistletoe, so that when a tiger or  bear trod upon them and, finding them sticking to his feet, paused  and rubbed these on his head, until he became blinded and  bewildered with a mass of sticky foliage, a well-placed shot would  stretch him dead.    [Illustration: For a year he worked with the shikaree.]    For a year he worked with the shikaree. Sometimes they hunted  simply for the value of the skins; but more often they were sent  for by villagers, who were suffering from the depredations of  tigers or leopards, and who were willing to pay for having them  killed. Harry Lindsay acquired quite a reputation in Jooneer and  the surrounding country, for the shikaree spoke freely of his  bravery, intelligence, and skill with his arms. His width of  shoulders and the strength of his muscles caused him to be regarded  as a prodigy; and it was generally considered that, when he grew  up, he would become a great fighter, and attain wide renown as a  leader of bands in the service of Holkar, or the Peishwa.    When he was sixteen, Sufder, who had watched his progress with  great approval, said to him:    \"You are scarce a man in years yet, Puntojee; but you are strong,  skilful with your weapons, and far more of a man than many ten  years older than yourself. It is time that you should see something  of war. Since the death of Scindia, a few months back; and the  succession of his nephew Doulut, who is about your own age; things  have become even more unsettled than before. Scindia was a great  man and, although at times worsted by his rivals, always managed to  repair his fortunes and to add to his power; but whether the young  Scindia will keep the wide territory that his uncle won is  doubtful. Holkar, although at times he and Scindia united, as when  the English marched against Poona, has been his rival and enemy.    \"The Peishwa has sometimes been in alliance with one of these great  princes, sometimes with the other. His minister, Nana Furnuwees, is  a man of commanding talent. Had it not been for him, it is probable  that Scindia and Holkar would long since have become altogether  independent; but he has always contrived to play one off against  the other and, by securing the services of the secondary chiefs,  such as the Rajah of Nagpore and the Rajah of Kolapoore, to hold  the balance of power; but he is an old man, and at his death there  is no saying how things will go.    \"Matters are complicated, too, by the fact that Scindia has now in  his service sixteen battalions of drilled infantry, commanded by  French officers; and these have proved so valuable, in the various  sieges he has undertaken, that Holkar has been obliged to imitate  his example. There are many who think that the introduction of  infantry will, in the end, prove disastrous to the power of the  Mahrattas; whose strength has hitherto lain in their cavalry, which  could perform long journeys, strike a blow and be off again, and so  were more than a match for the infantry of other Indian princes.  But with infantry all this will be altered, for the marches must be  no longer or"]]]
