If we accept the Light in one, we must accept the Light in all;  all agree, because all are the same. The teaching is ever the same, it is  only the outward forms that change.    The Manifestations of God are as the heavenly bodies. All have their  appointed place and time of ascension, but the Light they give is the  same. If one wishes to look for the sun rising, one does not look always  at the same point because that point changes with the seasons. When one  sees the sun rise further in the north one recognizes it, though it has  risen at a different point.            NOTES OF A CONVERSATION WITH 'ABDU'L-BAHA      A Coloured man from South Africa who was visiting 'Abdu'l-Baha, said that  even now no white people really cared very much for the black man.    'Abdu'l-Baha replies: Compare the present time and the feeling towards the  coloured people now, with the state of feeling two or three hundred years  ago, and see how much better it is at present. In a short time the  relationship between the coloured and white people will still further  improve, and bye and bye no difference will be felt between them. White  doves and purple doves exist, but both kinds are doves.    Baha'u'llah once compared the coloured people to the black pupil of the  eye surrounded by the white. In this black pupil you see the reflection of  that which is before it, and through it the light of the Spirit shines  forth.    In the sight of God colour makes no difference at all, He looks at the  hearts of men. That which God desires from men is the heart. A black man  with a good character is far superior to a white man with a character that  is less good.            IDEALS OF EAST AND WEST      One of the organizers of the Races Congress present spoke of the Western  ideals of Baha'u'llah as differing from those of former prophets which  were tinged with the ideas and civilization of the East. He then asked  whether Baha'u'llah had made a special study of Western writings, and  founded his teachings in accordance with them.    'Abdu'l-Baha laughed heartily, and said that the books of Baha'u'llah,  written and printed sixty years ago, contained the ideals now so familiar  to the West, but, at that time, they had not been printed or thought of in  the West. Besides, he continued, supposing that a very advanced thinker  from the West had gone to visit Baha'u'llah and to teach Him, would the  name of such a great man and the fact of his visit have been unknown and  unrecorded? No! In former days, in the time of the Buddha and Zoroaster,  civilization in Asia and in the East was very much higher than in the West  and ideas and thoughts of the Eastern peoples were much in advance of, and  nearer to the thoughts of God than those of the West. But since that time  superstitions had crept into the religion and ideals of the East, and from  many differing causes the ideals and characters of the Eastern peoples had  gone down and down, lower and lower, while the Western peoples had been  constantly advancing and struggling towards the Light. Consequently, in  these days, the civilization of the West was much higher than that of the  East, and the ideas and thoughts of the people of the West were much  nearer to the thought of God than those of the East. Therefore, the ideals  of Baha'u'llah had been more quickly realized in the West.    'Abdu'l-Baha showed further how Baha'u'llah had exactly described in one  of his books what has since been carried out in the International Council  of Arbitration, describing its various functions, some of which have not  yet been realized and he ('Abdu'l-Baha) would describe them to us now, so  that when they were fulfilled, as they would be in the near future, we  might know that they had been prophesied by Baha'u'llah.    War was the greatest calamity that could overtake the nations, because the  people usually employed in agriculture, trades, commerce, and other useful  arts, were taken away from their various occupations and turned into  soldiers, so that there was great waste and loss, in addition to the  destruction and carnage of war.    Baha'u'llah had said that the functions of the International Court would  be to settle disputes that arose from time to time between the nations; to  define the exact boundaries of the different countries, and to decide what  number of soldiers and guns should be maintained by each nation, according  to its population, in order to preserve internal order. For instance, one  country might have ten thousand soldiers, another twenty thousand, another  fifteen thousand, and so on, in accordance with the size and population of  the nation; also if any people rebelled against the decision of the Court  and rejected it, the Court would empower the others to join their forces  and to endorse their decision, if need be, by united action.    We had not seen any of these things actualized as yet, but we should do so  in the future.            SCIENCE AND FAITH      The gentleman then put a question which he said he considered of very  great importance in connection with a religious movement, claiming to be  universal. What position he asked, if any, did Baha'u'llah given to the  modern ideas and conceptions of Science in his teachings. The whole  structure of modern civilization is based upon the results and the  knowledge obtained through laborious and patient observation of facts  collected by men of Science: in some cases through hundreds of years of  painstaking investigation. To make his meaning clearer, he instanced the  ethic, and the moral teachings of the Chinese philosophers, than which he  could conceive nothing higher. However, these teachings had very little  effect outside of China, for the reason he considered, that they were not  primarily based on the teachings of Science.    'Abdu'l-Baha replied that a very great importance was given to Science and  knowledge in the writings of Baha'u'llah, who wrote that, if a man  educated the children of the poor, who could not themselves afford to do  so, it was, in the sight of God, as if he had educated the Son of God.    If any religion rejected Science and knowledge, that religion was false.  Science and Religion should go forward together; indeed, they should be  like two fingers of one hand.    Baha'u'llah had also in His writings given a most important place to Art,  and the practice of skilled trades. He had stated that the practice of an  Art or Trade in the true spirit of service was identical with the worship  of God.    A gentleman connected with the work of a Settlement then asked what was  the best method of raising up and civilizing the very lowest and most  degraded and ignorant of the people and would their education come about  gradually through the enlightenment of the Spirit, or was there any  special means we could adopt to further this end?    'Abdu'l-Baha replied that the best way was to give them spiritual  teachings and enlightenment. He also remarked that the way to broaden the  outlook of the very narrow-hearted and prejudiced, and to make them listen  to a wider teaching, was by showing towards them the greatest kindness and  love. The example of our lives was of more value than words.            CONVERSE WITH DEPARTED PERSONS      The question was asked if it were possible to establish communication with  the dead, and whether it was wise or advisable to attend seances or to  engage in table-turning, spirit-rapping, etc.    The Master said these rappings, etc., were all material things, and of the  body. What is needed is to rise above the material to the realms of the  purely Spiritual. Table-turning and such like were material, a natural  result, and not spiritual.    But it was possible to communicate with the dead through the condition of  the character and the heart.            ARE SUPERSTITIONS USEFUL      A lady enquired whether some superstitions might not be good for ignorant  people, who, if they were without them might perhaps be without beliefs of  any kind?    'Abdu'l-Baha replied that superstitions were of two kinds; those that were  harmful and dangerous, and those that were harmless and produced certain  good effects.    For example, there were some poor people who believed that misfortunes and  punishments were caused by a Great Angel with a sword in his hand, who  struck down those who stole, and committed murder and crimes.    They thought the flashes of lightning were the weapons of this angel, and  that if they did wrong they would be struck by lightning. This belief  caused them to refrain from evil actions.    The Chinese held a superstition that if they burn certain pieces of paper  this will drive the devils away; they sometimes burnt these pieces of  paper on board ships when they were travelling in order to drive away  devils, and by so doing they set fire to the ships and destroyed many  lives. This was a type of dangerous and harmful superstition.            THE LIFE AFTER DEATH      Mrs. S. asked some questions with reference to the conditions of existence  in the next world, and the life after death; she said that having recently  lost a very near relative, she had given much thought to this subject.  Many thought that re-union with those we had loved, and who had passed on  to the future life, would only take place after a long period of time had  elapsed. She wished to know whether one would be re-united with those who  had gone before immediately after death.    'Abdu'l-Baha answered that this would depend upon the respective stations  of the two. If both had the same degree of development, they would be  re-united immediately after death. The questioner then said, how could  this state of development be acquired? 'Abdu'l-Baha replied, by unceasing  effort, striving to do right, and to attain spiritual qualities.    The questioner remarked that many differing opinions were held as to the  conditions of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#7)"],[1,"you are rendering the Cause of God._    _Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi_          (26) December 22nd, 1934      Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian was profoundly grieved to learn of the passing away of your  dear mother, and has directed me to convey to you and to the bereaved  members of your family, his heartfelt condolences and sympathy for this  severe loss which you have sustained.    Mrs Blundell's departure is, indeed, a loss not only to her family, but  also to the community of her fellow-believers in New Zealand. For in her  they have come to lose one of their oldest and most distinguished  co-workers.    The Guardian well remembers her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and has  always cherished the hope that she would once more be enabled to visit the  shrines. But alas, her departed soul has taken its flight from this world,  leaving her friends and relatives in a state of profoundest grief. Their  only consolation now is the realization that through her painstaking and  sustained labours for the Cause in Auckland Mrs Blundell has left an  abiding monument to her memory, and one which will continue for many years  to come to inspire and strengthen them all in their collective endeavours  for the establishment of the Faith in New Zealand.    Shoghi Effendi is fervently praying for the soul of our departed sister,  and is entreating Baha'u'llah to give her her full share of divine  blessings in the other world.    May I also assure you of his ardent supplications for you, and for all the  friends in Auckland.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani          (27) January 21st, 1935      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Shoghi Effendi has just been in receipt of your kind letter of the  fourteenth of December last, and has read its contents with deep interest  and gratification. It made him so happy, indeed, to learn that you are  pursuing your activities for the Faith with such steadfastness and  self-sacrifice, and also that through your beautiful and loving spirit  those members of your family who have not yet embraced the Faith are being  gradually attracted to it. He is ardently entreating Baha'u'llah that  through your inspiration and guidance their interest in the Teachings may  wax stronger and lead them to eventually espouse His Cause.    With reference to the suggestion made by Mr Alexander(5) for taking a  record of the Guardian's voice, he wishes me to inform you that although  he fully appreciates the spirit in which this and similar suggestions are  made to him he is, nevertheless, extremely reluctant that the believers  should give any prominence to his writings, specially in the meetings  which, he is firmly convinced, should be chiefly devoted to the reading  and study of the writings of Baha'u'llah and the Master.    In closing will you kindly convey his greetings and appreciation to all  the friends in Auckland, and particularly to the members of your family  who, he hopes, will be assisted and sustained in their labours for the  spread of the Message.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-worker:_    _I am deeply grateful for the services you are so devotedly rendering and  the efforts you are so diligently exerting for the promotion of our  beloved Faith. I will continue to pray for you and your dear co-workers  from the depths of my heart._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (28) February 5th, 1935      Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian has just received your kind message of the second of January  last, and wishes me to thank you for it.    It comforted him greatly to learn that, despite the severe loss which you  have sustained through the passing away of your mother, you are still  engaged as actively as before in the work which you have set your heart to  accomplish for the Cause in Auckland. The agonies of her earthly  separation from you, difficult though they may be to bear, will assuredly  be transmuted through the blessings of Baha'u'llah into a peaceful and  abiding joy. In serving a Cause for which your mother sacrificed so much  you will no doubt come to find the very purpose of your life, and the true  secret of happiness in this, as well as in the next world.    The Guardian is fervently praying for you and for your brother, that you  both may be strengthened and guided in your services to the Cause, and in  this way continue and enrich still further the noble heritage which your  mother has left for the Faith in New-Zealand.    With loving Baha'i greetings to you and to all the friends in Auckland.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear co-worker:_    _I wish to assure you in person of my heartfelt sympathy in the loss you  have sustained, and of my loving and ardent prayers for the departed soul.  The work with which her name will for ever be associated will confer upon  her imperishable glory, and her example will serve to stimulate the rising  generation to follow in her footsteps, and carry on the work she has so  nobly initiated._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (29) May 20th, 1936      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Many thanks indeed from the Guardian for your welcome message of April  17th just received. He would certainly be delighted to meet you in Haifa  next year, and hopes that your visit to the Holy Shrines will give you a  fresh vigour and a renewed determination to carry on your work for the  Cause. He specially cherishes the hope that your trip to England will be  of great benefit to you, and also to our English believers. They will be  only too happy to welcome you in their midst, and will thoroughly  appreciate any assistance which you may give them during your sojourn in  England.    The Guardian has learned with deep gratification of the news of the  teaching work carried on by the Auckland believers. He wishes you to  kindly assure them all of his best wishes and fervent prayers for the  success of their labours. May Baha'u'llah bless, guide and strengthen them  in every step they are taking for the spread of His Faith and the  consolidation of its institutions in this far-off land.    Assuring you too of his special prayers on your behalf at the Holy  Shrines, and with warmest greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Assuring you of a most hearty welcome, and wishing you good-health,  happiness and success,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (30) September 30th, 1936      Beloved Baha'i Sister,    Your welcome letter dated August 17th has been received and read with  deepest appreciation by the Guardian.    May I again express his sincere hope that your long-cherished desire to  visit the Holy Shrines may be fulfilled very soon, and that through this  pilgrimage you may attain a renewed zeal and vigour, as well as a new  vision of the task you are called upon to accomplish for the Faith in  New-Zealand.    In closing let me assure you and your fellow-workers in Auckland of his  profound appreciation of your determination to press forward the work in  the teaching field. He is ardently praying for the guidance and success of  your labours.    With warmest greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Beloved fulfil your heart's desire, and enable you to promote  effectively the sacred and manifold interests of our beloved and glorious  Faith,_    _Your true and grateful brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (31) December 7th, 1936      Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of the fifth November, and  exceedingly regrets that, owing to certain family difficulties, you have  found it necessary to cancel your trip to the Holy Land. He is specially  grieved to learn of the many cares and sorrows with which your daughter  has been so sadly afflicted of late, and wishes me to hasten to convey to  you his most loving sympathy, as well as the assurance of his prayers for  the removal of the family troubles with which you are beset. He fervently  hopes that these afflictive trials confronting you and your beloved  daughter will all serve to quicken your spiritual energies, and that the  outcome of it all will be to open before you new horizons of service, and  fresh fields for teaching the Message. May Baha'u'llah give you patience  to courageously withstand these tests, and full guidance to use them as a  means to more active, concentrated and selfless service to His Cause. Do  assure, therefore, your daughter not to feel disheartened, but to  confidently endeavour to overcome her domestic sorrows and cares.    In closing may I express the Guardian's hope that, as soon as your family  problems are solved, you may be able to undertake your long-cherished  pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines. He is ardently praying for the  materialization of your hopes and plans in this connection.    It is a pleasure to learn of the successful visit of Mr Schopflocher(6) to  Auckland, and of the warm welcome he has been accorded by you and the  friends. This is a true evidence of the strong ties of fellowship so  closely uniting the friends throughout the world, and of the deep  affection which the believers in New-Zealand cherish for their  fellow-believers in every region and clime.
