But in the meantime--\" Van Rycke gestured to the waiting  Salariki who were beginning to mutter impatiently. Kallee glanced around,  heard those mutters, and made the only move possible, away from the  Queen. He was not quite so cocky, but neither had he surrendered.    Dane caught at Tau's sleeve and asked the question which had been burning  in him since he had come upon the scene.    \"What happened--about the catnip?\"    There was lightening of the serious expression on Tau's face.    \"Fortunately for you that child took the leaves to the storm priest. They  tested and approved it. And I can't see that it has any ill effects. But  you were just lucky, Thorson--it might have gone another way.\"    Dane sighed. \"I know that, sir,\" he confessed. \"I'm not trying to rocket  out--\"    Tau gave a half-smile. \"We all off-fire our tubes at times,\" he  conceded. \"Only next time--\"    He did not need to complete that warning as Dane caught him up:    \"There isn't going to be a next time like this, sir--ever!\"          Chapter IV    GORP HUNT      But the interruption had disturbed the tenor of trading. The small chief  who had so eagerly taken Paft's place had only two Koros stones to offer  and even to Dane's inexperienced eyes they were inferior in size and  color to those the other clan leader had tendered. The Terrans were aware  that Koros mining was a dangerous business but they had not known that  the stock of available stones was so very small. Within ten minutes the  last of the serious bargaining was concluded and the clansmen were  drifting away from the burned over space about the Queen's standing fins.    Dane folded up the bargain cloth, glad for a task. He sensed that he was  far from being back in Van Rycke's good graces. The fact that his  superior did not discuss any of the aspects of the deals with him was a  bad sign.    Captain Jellico stretched. Although his was not, or never, what might be  termed a good-humored face, he was at peace with his world. \"That would  seem to be all. What's the haul, Van?\"    \"Ten first class stones, about fifty second grade, and twenty or so of  third. The chiefs will go to the fisheries tomorrow. _Then_ we'll be in  to see the really good stuff.\"    \"And how's the herbs holding out?\" That interested Dane too. Surely the  few plants in the hydro and the dried leaves could not be stretched too  far.    \"As well as we could expect.\" Van Rycke frowned. \"But Craig thinks he's  on the trail of something to help--\"    The storm priests had uprooted the staff marking the trading station and  were wrapping the white streamer about it. Their leader had already gone  and now Tau came up to the group by the ramp.    \"Van says you have an idea,\" the Captain hailed him.    \"We haven't tried it yet. And we can't unless the priests give it a clear  lane--\"    \"That goes without saying--\" Jellico agreed.    The Captain had not addressed that remark to him personally, but Dane was  sure it had been directed at him. Well, they needn't worry--never again  was he going to make that mistake, they could be very sure of that.    He was part of the conference which followed in the mess cabin only  because he was a member of the crew. How far the reason for his disgrace  had spread he had no way of telling, but he made no overtures, even to  Rip.    Tau had the floor with Mura as an efficient lieutenant. He discussed the  properties of catnip and gave information on the limited supply the Queen  carried. Then he launched into a new suggestion.    \"Felines of Terra, in fact a great many other of our native mammals, have  a similar affinity for this.\"    Mura produced a small flask and Tau opened it, passing it to Captain  Jellico and so from hand to hand about the room. Each crewman sniffed at  the strong aroma. It was a heavier scent than that given off by the  crushed catnip--Dane was not sure he liked it. But a moment later Sinbad  streaked in from the corridor and committed the unpardonable sin of  leaping to the table top just before Mura who had taken the flask from  Dane. He miaowed plaintively and clawed at the steward's cuff. Mura  stoppered the flask and put the cat down on the floor.    \"What is it?\" Jellico wanted to know.    \"Anisette, a liquor made from the oil of anise--from seeds of the anise  plant. It is a stimulant, but we use it mainly as a condiment. If it is  harmless for the Salariki it ought to be a bigger bargaining point than  any perfumes or spices, I-S can import. And remember, with their  unlimited capital, they can flood the market with products we can't  touch, selling at a loss if need be to cut us out. Because their ship is  not going to lift from Sargol just because she has no legal right here.\"    \"There's this point,\" Van Rycke added to the lecture. \"The Eysies are  trading or want to trade perfumes. But they stock only manufactured  products, exotic stuff, but synthetic.\" He took from his belt pouch two  tiny boxes.    Before he caught the rich scent of the paste inside them Dane had already  identified each as luxury items from Casper--chemical products which sold  well and at high prices in the civilized ports of the Galaxy. The  Cargo-master turned the boxes over, exposing the symbol on their  undersides--the mark of I-S.    \"These were offered to me in trade by a Salarik. I took them, just to  have proof that the Eysies are operating here. But--note--they were  offered to me in trade, along with two top Koros for what? One spoonful  of dried catnip leaves. Does that suggest anything?\"    Mura answered first. \"The Salariki prefer natural products to synthetic.\"    \"I think so.\"    \"D'you suppose that was Cam's secret?\" speculated Astrogator Steen  Wilcox.    \"If it was,\" Jellico cut in, \"he certainly kept it! If we had only known  this earlier--\"    They were all thinking of that, of their storage space carefully packed  with useless trade goods. Where, if they had known, the same space could  have carried herbs with five or twenty-five times as much buying power.    \"Maybe now that their sales' resistance is broken, we _can_ switch to  some of the other stuff,\" Tang Ya, torn away from his beloved  communicators for the conference, said wistfully. \"They like color--how  about breaking out some rolls of Harlinian moth silk?\"    Van Rycke sighed wearily. \"Oh, we'll try. We'll bring out everything and  anything. But we could have done so much better--\" he brooded over the  tricks of fate which had landed them on a planet wild for trade with no  proper trade goods in either of their holds.    There was a nervous little sound of a throat being apologetically  cleared. Jasper Weeks, the small wiper from the engine room detail, the  third generation Venusian colonist whom the more vocal members of the  Queen's complement were apt to forget upon occasion, seeing all eyes upon  him, spoke though his voice was hardly above a hoarse whisper.    \"Cedar--lacquel bark--forsh weed--\"    \"Cinnamon,\" Mura added to the list. \"Imported in small quantities--\"    \"Naturally! Only the problem now is--how much cedar, lacquel bark, forsh  weed, cinnamon do we have on board?\" demanded Van Rycke.    His sarcasm did not register with Weeks for the little man pushed by Dane  and left the cabin to their surprise. In the quiet which followed they  could hear the clatter of his boots on ladder rungs as he descended to  the quarters of the engine room staff. Tang turned to his neighbor,  Johan Stotz, the Queen's Engineer.    \"What's he going for?\"    Stotz shrugged. Weeks was a self-effacing man--so much so that even in  the cramped quarters of the spacer very little about him as an individual  impressed his mates--a fact which was slowly dawning on them all now.  Then they heard the scramble of feet hurrying back and Weeks burst in  with energy which carried him across to the table behind which the  Captain and Van Rycke now sat.    In the wiper's hands was a plasta-steel box--the treasure chest of a  spaceman. Its tough exterior was guaranteed to protect the contents  against everything but outright disintegration. Weeks put it down on the  table and snapped up the lid.    A new aroma, or aromas, was added to the scents now at war in the cabin.  Weeks pulled out a handful of fluffy white stuff which frothed up about  his fingers like soap lather. Then with more care he lifted up a tray  divided into many small compartments, each with a separate sealing lid of  its own. The men of the Queen moved in, their curiosity aroused, until  they were jostling one another.    Being tall Dane had an advantage, though Van Rycke's bulk and the wide  shoulders of the Captain were between him and the object they were so  intent upon. In each division of the tray, easily seen through the  transparent lids, was a carved figure. The weird denizens of the Venusian  polar swamps were there, along with lifelike effigies of Terran animals,  a Martian sand-mouse in all its monstrous ferocity, and the native animal  and reptile life of half a hundred different worlds. Weeks put down a  second tray beside the first, again displaying a menagerie of strange  life forms. But when he clicked open one of the compartments and handed  the figurine it contained to the Captain, Dane understood the reason for  now bringing forward the carvings.    The majority of them were fashioned from a dull blue-gray wood and Dane  knew that if he picked one up he would discover that it weighed close to  nothing in his hand. That was lacquel bark--the aromatic product of a  Venusian vine. And each little animal or reptile lay encased in a soft  dab of frothy white--frosh weed--the perfumed seed casing of the Martian  canal plants. One or two figures on the second tray were of a red-brown  wood and these Van Rycke sniffed at appreciatively.    \"Cedar--Terran cedar,\" he murmured.    Weeks nodded eagerly, his eyes alight. \"I am waiting now for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#7)"],[1," suggestion, however  wise, that was not his own, and extremely obstinate with men who knew  more than he did.    On January 15, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of       27  Apollo, the priest Umbricius declared the omens unfavourable: treason  was impending, and an enemy within the walls. Otho, who was standing  beside Galba, overheard and construed the omen as being from his own  point of view a good one, favourable to his plans. In a few moments  his freedman, Onomastus, announced that the architect and contractors  were waiting to see him. This had been agreed upon as the signal that  the troops were assembling and the conspiracy was ripe. On being asked  where he was going, Otho pretended that he was buying an old property,  but suspected its condition and so had to inspect it first. Thus,  leaning on his freedman's shoulder, he passed through Tiberius' house  into the Velabrum and thence to the Golden Milestone at the foot of  the Temple of Saturn.[55] There thirty-three soldiers of the Body  Guard saluted him as emperor. When he showed alarm at the smallness of  their number they put him hastily into a litter, and, drawing their  swords, hurried him away. About the same number of soldiers joined  them on the way, some accomplices, others merely curious. Some marched  along shouting and flourishing swords; others kept silent, intending  to take their cue from subsequent events.    Julius Martialis was the tribune on duty in the camp. He was so         28  overcome by the magnitude of this unexpected crime and so afraid that  the treason was widespread in the camp, and that he might be killed if  he offered any opposition, that he led most people to suppose he was  in the plot. So, too, the other tribunes and centurions all preferred  present safety to a risky loyalty. In fact the general attitude was  this: few dared to undertake so foul a crime, many wished to see it  done, and everybody was ready to condone it.    FOOTNOTES:        [47] Cp. chap. 13.        [48] Decrees excluding astrologers from Italy had been passed           in B.C. 33, A.D. 16, and again in A.D. 52. Vitellius passed           another. See ii. 62.        [49] Nero's wife. Cp. chap. 13.        [50] i.e. to Lusitania. See chap. 13.        [51] They were 'Guards' who had escorted Nero on his singing           tours through Greece. Perhaps some of them came to meet Galba           on his way from Spain. Otherwise they could not have shared           the toils of this march.        [52] See chap. 72.        [53] The public dinner given in older days by patrons to their           clients had long ago been commuted for a 'tip' (sportula).           Pudens, instead of providing dinner for Galba's guard, sought           their favour by giving them about 17_s._ apiece.        [54] The English terms do not of course represent the exact           position of these soldiers. The former was one of the           emperor's personal body-guard (speculatores), who received the           watchword (tessera) and passed it round: the latter was one to           whom a centurion had delegated some part of his work.        [55] Plutarch explains this. 'He passed through Tiberius'           house, as it is called, and walked down to the Forum, where           stands the golden pillar to which all the high-roads of Italy           lead.' The Velabrum lies between the Forum, the Tiber, and the           Aventine.      THE FALL OF GALBA    Meanwhile Galba in total ignorance and intent upon his sacrifices       29  continued to importune the gods of an empire that had already ceased  to be his. First there came a rumour that some one or other of the  senators was being hurried to the camp, then that it was Otho.  Immediately people who had met Otho came flocking in from all quarters  of Rome; some in their terror exaggerated the truth, some minimized  it, remembering even then to flatter. After discussion it was decided  that the temper of the cohort on guard in the palace should be tested,  but not by Galba himself. His authority was held in reserve for more  heroic remedies. The troops were summoned. Piso, standing out on the  steps of the palace, addressed them as follows:    'Fellow soldiers, it is now five days since I was made a Caesar. I  knew nothing of the future nor whether the name was more to be desired  or feared. It now lies with you to decide whether or no my adoption is  to prove a calamity for my house and for my country. In saying this, I  do not dread disaster on my own account. I have known misfortune, and  I am now discovering to the full that prosperity is just as dangerous.  But for the sake of my adoptive father, of the senate, and of the  whole empire, I deplore the thought that we may have to-day either to  die or--what for good men is as wretched--to kill. In the recent  revolution our comfort was that Rome was spared the sight of blood,  and the transfer was effected without disturbance. We thought that my  adoption would be a safeguard against an outbreak of civil war even  after Galba's death.    'I will make no claims to rank or respectability. To compare            30  myself with Otho, I need not recite my virtues. His vices are all he  has to be proud of. They ruined the empire, even when he was only  playing the part of an emperor's friend. Why should he deserve to be  emperor? For his swaggering demeanour? For his effeminate costume?  Extravagance imposes on some people. They take it for liberality. They  are wrong. He will know how to squander money, but not how to give it  away. His mind is full of lechery and debauchery and intrigues with  women. These are in his eyes the prerogatives of the throne. And the  pleasure of his vices would be all his, the blushes of shame would be  ours. No man has ever ruled well who won the throne by bad means.    'The whole Roman world agreed to give Galba the title of Caesar. Galba  with your approval gave that title to me. Even if the \"country\", the  \"senate\", the \"people\", are empty terms, it is to your interest, my  fellow soldiers, to see that it is not the rascals who create an  emperor. From time to time one hears of the legionaries being in  mutiny against their generals. But your good faith and your good name  have stood to this day unimpaired. It was not you who deserted Nero:  he deserted you. Are you going to allow less than thirty deserters and  renegades to bestow the crown? Why! no one would tolerate their  choosing so much as a centurion or a tribune for themselves. Are you  going to allow this precedent, and by your acquiescence make their  crime your own? You will soon see this lawless spirit spreading to the  troops abroad, and in time the treason will recoil on us and the war  on you. Besides, innocence wins you as much as the murder of your  emperor: you will get from us as large a bounty for your loyalty as  you would from others for your crime.'    The members of the Body Guard dispersed. The rest of the cohort         31  paid some heed to his speech. Aimlessly, as happens in moments of  confusion, they seized their standards, without as yet any fixed plan,  and not, as was afterwards believed, to cloak their treachery. Marius  Celsus had been dispatched to the picked detachments of the Illyrian  army, which were quartered in the Vipsanian arcade,[56] while  instructions had been given to two senior centurions,[57] Amullius  Serenus and Domitius Sabinus, to summon the German troops from the  Hall of Liberty. They distrusted the legion of marines, who had been  alienated by Galba's butchery of their comrades on his entry into  Rome.[58] Three officers of the guards, Cetrius Severus, Subrius  Dexter, and Pompeius Longinus, also hurried to the camp in the hope  that the mutiny was still in its early stages and might be averted by  good advice before it came to a head. The soldiers attacked Subrius  and Cetrius with threats and forcibly seizing Longinus disarmed him,  because he had not come in virtue of his military rank, but simply as  one of Galba's private friends; and for his loyalty to his master the  rebels disliked him all the more. The marines without any hesitation  joined the guards. The Illyrian draft[59] drove Celsus away at the  point of their javelins. The German detachments[59] wavered for some  time. They were still in poor condition physically, and inclined to be  passive. Nero had dispatched them as an advance-guard to  Alexandria;[60] the long voyage back again had damaged their health,  and Galba had spared no expense in looking after them.    The whole populace of Rome was now crowding into the palace             32  together with a good sprinkling of slaves. With discordant shouts they  demanded the death of Otho and the doom of the conspirators. They  might have been in the circus or the theatre, clamouring for  entertainment. There was neither sense nor sincerity in their  behaviour. They were quite ready on the same day to clamour for the  opposite with equal zeal. But it is an established custom to flatter  any emperor with unbridled cheering and meaningless enthusiasm.  Meanwhile Galba was torn between two opinions. Titus Vinius maintained  that they ought to remain within the palace, employ the slaves to  offer resistance and block up all the doors, instead of going out to  face the angry troops. 'This will give time,' he urged, 'for the  disloyal to repent and the loyal to unite their forces. Crimes demand  haste, good counsels profit by delay. Besides, if need be, we shall  have the same chance of leaving the palace later: if we leave and  repent of it, it will not be in our power to return.'    All the others voted for immediate action before the conspiracy         33  gathered strength and numbers. 'Otho,' they argued, 'will soon lose  heart. He crept away by stealth and was introduced in a litter to a  parcel of strangers, and now because we dally and waste time he has  leisure to rehearse his part of emperor. What is "]]]
