Why should you not collect scarabs?\"    \"Because,\" said Mr. Peters, \"I shouldn't know one if you brought  it to me on a plate. What are scarabs?\"    \"Scarabs,\" said the specialist, warming to his subject, \"the  Egyptian hieroglyphs.\"    \"And what,\" inquired Mr. Peters, \"are Egyptian hieroglyphs?\"    The specialist began to wonder whether it would not have been  better to advise Mr. Peters to collect postage stamps.    \"A scarab,\" he said--\"derived from the Latin scarabeus--is  literally a beetle.\"    \"I will not collect beetles!\" said Mr. Peters definitely. \"They  give me the Willies.\"    \"Scarabs are Egyptian symbols in the form of beetles,\" the  specialist hurried on. \"The most common form of scarab is in the  shape of a ring. Scarabs were used for seals. They were also  employed as beads or ornaments. Some scarabaei bear inscriptions  having reference to places; as, for instance: 'Memphis is mighty  forever.'\"    Mr. Peters' scorn changed to active interest.    \"Have you got one like that?\"    \"Like what?\"    \"A scarab boosting Memphis. It's my home town.\"    \"I think it possible that some other Memphis was alluded to.\"    \"There isn't any other except the one in Tennessee,\" said Mr.  Peters patriotically.    The specialist owed the fact that he was a nerve doctor instead  of a nerve patient to his habit of never arguing with his  visitors.    \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"you would care to glance at my collection.  It is in the next room.\"    That was the beginning of Mr. Peters' devotion to scarabs. At  first he did his collecting without any love of it, partly  because he had to collect something or suffer, but principally  because of a remark the specialist made as he was leaving the  room.    \"How long would it take me to get together that number of the  things?\" Mr. Peters inquired, when, having looked his fill on the  dullest assortment of objects he remembered ever to have seen, he  was preparing to take his leave.    The specialist was proud of his collection. \"How long? To make a  collection as large as mine? Years, Mr. Peters. Oh, many, many  years.\"    \"I'll bet you a hundred dollars I'll do it in six months!\"    From that moment Mr. Peters brought to the collecting of scarabs  the same furious energy which had given him so many dollars and  so much indigestion. He went after scarabs like a dog after rats.  He scooped in scarabs from the four corners of the earth, until  at the end of a year he found himself possessed of what, purely  as regarded quantity, was a record collection.    This marked the end of the first phase of--so to speak--the  scarabaean side of his life. Collecting had become a habit with  him, but he was not yet a real enthusiast. It occurred to him  that the time had arrived for a certain amount of pruning and  elimination. He called in an expert and bade him go through the  collection and weed out what he felicitously termed the \"dead  ones.\" The expert did his job thoroughly. When he had finished,  the collection was reduced to a mere dozen specimens.    \"The rest,\" he explained, \"are practically valueless. If you are  thinking of making a collection that will have any value in the  eyes of archeologists I should advise you to throw them away. The  remaining twelve are good.\"    \"How do you mean--good? Why is one of these things valuable and  another so much punk? They all look alike to me.\"    And then the expert talked to Mr. Peters for nearly two hours  about the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, Osiris, Ammon, Mut,  Bubastis, dynasties, Cheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels,  Amenophis III, Queen Taia, the Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the  lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis, and the Book of the Dead. He did it  with a relish. He liked to do it.    When he had finished, Mr. Peters thanked him and went to the  bathroom, where he bathed his temples with eau de Cologne.    That talk changed J. Preston Peters from a supercilious  scooper-up of random scarabs to what might be called a genuine  scarab fan. It does not matter what a man collects; if Nature has  given him the collector's mind he will become a fanatic on the  subject of whatever collection he sets out to make. Mr. Peters  had collected dollars; he began to collect scarabs with precisely  the same enthusiasm. He would have become just as enthusiastic  about butterflies or old china if he had turned his thoughts to  them; but it chanced that what he had taken up was the collecting  of the scarab, and it gripped him more and more as the years went  on.    Gradually he came to love his scarabs with that love, surpassing  the love of women, which only collectors know. He became an  expert on those curious relics of a dead civilization. For a time  they ran neck and neck in his thoughts with business. When he  retired from business he was free to make them the master passion  of his life. He treasured each individual scarab in his  collection as a miser treasures gold.    Collecting, as Mr. Peters did it, resembles the drink habit. It  begins as an amusement and ends as an obsession. He was gloating  over his treasures when the maid announced Lord Emsworth.    A curious species of mutual toleration--it could hardly be  dignified by the title of friendship--had sprung up between these  two men, so opposite in practically every respect. Each regarded  the other with that feeling of perpetual amazement with which we  encounter those whose whole viewpoint and mode of life is foreign  to our own.    The American's force and nervous energy fascinated Lord Emsworth.  As for Mr. Peters, nothing like the earl had ever happened to him  before in a long and varied life. Each, in fact, was to the other  a perpetual freak show, with no charge for admission. And if  anything had been needed to cement the alliance it would have  been supplied by the fact that they were both collectors.    They differed in collecting as they did in everything else. Mr.  Peters' collecting, as has been shown, was keen, furious,  concentrated; Lord Emsworth's had the amiable dodderingness that  marked every branch of his life. In the museum at Blandings  Castle you could find every manner of valuable and valueless  curio. There was no central motive; the place was simply an  amateur junk shop. Side by side with a Gutenberg Bible for which  rival collectors would have bidden without a limit, you would  come on a bullet from the field of Waterloo, one of a consignment  of ten thousand shipped there for the use of tourists by a  Birmingham firm. Each was equally attractive to its owner.    \"My dear Mr. Peters,\" said Lord Emsworth sunnily, advancing into  the room, \"I trust I am not unpunctual. I have been lunching at  my club.\"    \"I'd have asked you to lunch here,\" said Mr. Peters, \"but you  know how it is with me . . . I've promised the doctor I'll give  those nuts and grasses of his a fair trial, and I can do it  pretty well when I'm alone with Aline; but to have to sit by and  see somebody else eating real food would be trying me too high.\"    Lord Emsworth murmured sympathetically. The other's digestive  tribulations touched a ready chord. An excellent trencherman  himself, he understood what Mr. Peters must suffer.    \"Too bad!\" he said.    Mr. Peters turned the conversation into other channels.    \"These are my scarabs,\" he said.    Lord Emsworth adjusted his glasses, and the mild smile  disappeared from his face, to be succeeded by a set look. A stage  director of a moving-picture firm would have recognized the look.  Lord Emsworth was registering interest--interest which he  perceived from the first instant would have to be completely  simulated; for instinct told him, as Mr. Peters began to talk,  that he was about to be bored as he had seldom been bored in his  life.    Mr. Peters, in his character of showman, threw himself into his  work with even more than his customary energy. His flow of speech  never faltered. He spoke of the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom,  Osiris and Ammon; waxed eloquent concerning Mut, Bubastis,  Cheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels and Amenophis III;  and became at times almost lyrical when touching on Queen Taia,  the Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis  and the Book of the Dead. Time slid by.    \"Take a look at this, Lord Emsworth.\"    As one who, brooding on love or running over business projects in  his mind, walks briskly into a lamppost and comes back to the  realities of life with a sense of jarring shock, Lord Emsworth  started, blinked and returned to consciousness. Far away his mind  had been--seventy miles away--in the pleasant hothouses and shady  garden walks of Blandings Castle. He came back to London to find  that his host, with a mingled air of pride and reverence, was  extending toward him a small, dingy-looking something.    He took it and looked at it. That, apparently, was what he was  meant to do. So far, all was well.    \"Ah!\" he said--that blessed word; covering everything! He  repeated it, pleased at his ready resource.    \"A Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty,\" said Mr. Peters fervently.    \"I beg your pardon?\"    \"A Cheops--of the Fourth Dynasty.\"    Lord Emsworth began to feel like a hunted stag. He could not go  on saying \"Ah!\" indefinitely; yet what else was there to say to  this curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thing?    \"Dear me! A Cheops!\"    \"Of the Fourth Dynasty!\"    \"Bless my soul! The Fourth Dynasty!\"    \"What do you think of that--eh?\"    Strictly speaking, Lord Emsworth thought nothing of it; and he  was wondering how to veil this opinion in diplomatic words, when  the providence that looks after all good men saved him by causing  a knock at the door to occur. In response to Mr. Peters'  irritated cry a maid entered.    \"If you please, sir, Mr. Threepwood wishes to speak with you on  the telephone.\"    Mr. Peters turned to his guest. \"Excuse me for one moment.\"    \"Certainly,\" said Lord Emsworth gratefully. \"Certainly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#7)"],[1,"his ideas on  morphology are fresh and illuminating. Few naturalists have been so  free from the prejudices and traditions of their trade. He makes in  the _Discours sur la Nature des Animaux_[34] a distinction, which  Bichat and Cuvier later developed with much profit, between the  \"animal\" and the \"vegetative\" part of animals.[35] The vegetative or  organic functions go on continuously, even in sleep, and are performed  by the internal organs, of which the heart is the central one. The  active waking life of the animal, that part of its life which  distinguishes it from the plant, involves the external parts--the  sense-organs and the extremities. An animal is, as it were, made up of  a complex of organs performing the vegetative functions, assimilation,  growth, and reproduction, surrounded by an envelope formed by the  limbs, the sense-organs, the nerves and the brain, which is the centre  of this \"envelope.\"[36] Animals may differ from one another enormously  in the external parts, particularly in the appendicular skeleton,  without showing any great difference in the plan and arrangement of  their internal organs. Quadrupeds, Cetacea, birds, amphibians and fish  are as unlike as possible in external form and in the shape of their  limbs; but they all resemble one another in their internal organs. Let  the internal organs change, however--the external parts will change  infinitely more, and you will get another animal, an animal of a  totally different nature. Thus an insect has a most singular internal  economy, and, in consequence, you find it is in every point different  from any vertebrate animal.    In this contrast, on the whole justified, between the importance of  variations in the \"vegetative\" and variations in the \"animal\" parts,  one may see without doing violence to Buffon's thought, an indication  of the difference between homology and analogy. It is usually in the  external parts, in the organs by which the animal adapts itself to its  environment, that one meets with the greatest number of analogical  resemblances. This contrast of vegetative and animal parts and their  relative importance for the discovery of affinities was at any rate a  considerable step towards an analysis of the concept of unity of plan.    To Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) belongs the credit of working out in  detail the distinction drawn by Aristotle and Buffon between the  animal and the vegetative functions. Bichat was not a comparative  anatomist; his interest lay in human anatomy, normal and pathological.  So his views are drawn chiefly from the consideration of human  structure.    He classifies functions into those relating to the individual and  those relating to the species. The functions pertaining to the  individual may be divided into those of the animal and those of the  organic life.[37] \"I call _animal life_ that order of functions which  connects us with surrounding bodies; signifying thereby that this  order belongs only to animals\" (p. lxxviii.). Its organs are the  afferent and efferent nerves, the brain, the sense-organs and the  voluntary muscles; the brain is its central organ. \"Digestion,  circulation, respiration, exhalation, absorption, secretion,  nutrition, calorification, or production of animal heat, compose  organic life, whose principal and central organ is the heart\" (p.  lxxix.).    The contrast of the animal and the organic life runs through all  Bichat's work; it receives classical expression in his _Recherches  Physiologiques sur la Vie et la Mort_ (1800). The plant and the animal  stand for two different modes of living. The plant lives within  itself, and has with the external world only relations of nutrition;  the animal adds to this organic life a life of active relation with  surrounding things (3rd ed., 1805, p. 2). \"One might almost say that  the plant is the framework, the foundation of the animal, and that to  form the animal it sufficed to cover this foundation with a system of  organs fitted to establish relations with the world outside. It  follows that the functions of the animal form two quite distinct  classes. One class consists in a continual succession of assimilation  and excretion; through these functions the animal incessantly  transforms into its own substance the molecules of surrounding bodies,  later to reject these molecules when they have become heterogeneous to  it. Through this first class of functions the animal exists only  within itself; through the other class it exists outside; it is an  inhabitant of the world, and not, like the plant, of the place which  saw its birth. The animal feels and perceives its surroundings,  reflects its sensations, moves of its own will under their influence,  and, as a rule, can communicate by its voice its desires and its  fears, its pleasures or its pains. I call organic life the sum of the  functions of the former class, for all organised creatures, plants or  animals, possess them to a more or less marked degree, and organised  structure is the sole condition necessary to their exercise. The  combined functions of the second class form the 'animal' life, so  named because it is the exclusive attribute of the animal kingdom\"  (pp. 2-3).    In both lives there is a double movement, in the animal life from the  periphery to the centre and from the centre to the periphery, in the  organic life also from the exterior to the interior and back again,  but here a movement of composition and decomposition. As the brain  mediates between sensation and motion, so the vascular system is the  go-between of the organs of assimilation and the organs of  dissimilation.    The most essential structural difference between the organs of animal  life and the organs of organic life is in man and the higher animals  at least, the symmetry of the one set and the irregularity of the  other--compare the symmetry of the nerves and muscles of the animal  life with the asymmetrical disposition of the visceral muscles and the  sympathetic nerves, which belong to the organic life.    Noteworthy differences exist between the two lives with respect to the  influence of habit. Everything in the animal life is under the  dominion of habit. Habit dulls sensation, habit strengthens the  judgment. In the organic life, on the contrary, habit exercises no  influence. The difference comes out clearly in the development of the  individual. The organs of the organic life attain their full  perfection independently of use; the organs of the animal life require  an education, and without education they do not reach perfection  (_Loc. cit._, p. 127).    Bichat was the founder of what was known for a time as General  Anatomy--the study of the constituent tissues of the body in health  and disease. His classification of tissues was macroscopical and  physiological; he relied upon texture and function in distinguishing  them rather than upon microscopical structure. The tissues he  distinguished are as follows:--[38]    1. The cellular membrane.  2. Nerves of animal life.  3. Nerves of organic life.  4. Arteries.  5. Veins.  6. Exhalants.  7. Absorbents and glands.  8. Bones.  9. Medulla.  10. Cartilage.  11. Fibrous tissue.  12. Fibro-cartilage.  13. Muscles of organic life.  14. Muscles of animal life.  15. Mucous membrane.  16. Serous membrane.  17. Synovial membrane.  18. The Glands.  19. The Dermis.  20. Epidermis.  21. Cutis.    The \"cellular membrane\" seems to mean undifferentiated connective  tissue; \"exhalants\" are imperceptible tubes arising from the  capillaries and secreting fat, serum, marrow, etc.; the \"absorbents  and glands\" are the lymphatics and the lymphatic glands.    In Bichat's eyes this resolution of the organism into tissues had a  deeper significance than any separation into organs, for to each  tissue must be attributed a _vie propre_, an individual and peculiar  life. \"When we study a function we must consider the complicated organ  which performs it in a general way; but if we would be instructed in  the properties and life of that organ we must absolutely resolve it  into its constituent parts.\"[39] The tissues have, too, a great  importance for pathology, for diseases are often diseases of tissues  rather than of organs.[40]        [9] _Le Monde vegetal_, p. 41, Paris, 1907.
