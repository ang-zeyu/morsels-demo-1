She was the daughter of Ops, son of  Peisenor, and Laertes bought her on a time with his wealth,  while as yet she was in her first youth, and gave for her  the worth of twenty oxen. And he honoured her even as he  honoured his dear wife in the halls, but he never lay with  her, for he shunned the wrath of his lady. She went with  Telemachus and bare for him the burning torches: and of all  the women of the household she loved him most, and she had  nursed him when a little one. Then he opened the doors of  the well-builded chamber and sat him on the bed and took  off his soft doublet, and put it in the wise old woman's  hands. So she folded the doublet and smoothed it, and hung  it on a pin by the jointed bedstead, and went forth on her  way from the room, and pulled to the door with the silver  handle, and drew home the bar with the thong. There, all  night through, wrapped in a fleece of wool, he meditated in  his heart upon the journey that Athene had showed him.        Book II      Telemachus complains in vain, and borrowing a ship, goes    secretly to Pylos by night. And how he was there received.    Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,  the dear son of Odysseus gat him up from his bed, and put  on his raiment and cast his sharp sword about his shoulder,  and beneath his smooth feet he bound his goodly sandals,  and stept forth from his chamber in presence like a god.  And straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to call  the long-haired Achaeans to the assembly. And the heralds  called the gathering, and the Achaeans were assembled  quickly. Now when they were gathered and come together, he  went on his way to the assembly holding in his hand a spear  of bronze,--not alone he went, for two swift hounds bare  him company. Then Athene shed on him a wondrous grace, and  all the people marvelled at him as he came. And he sat him  in his father's seat and the elders gave place to him.    Then the lord Aegyptus spake among them first; bowed was he  with age, and skilled in things past number. Now for this  reason he spake that his dear son, the warrior Antiphus,  had gone in the hollow ships to Ilios of the goodly steeds;  but the savage Cyclops slew him in his hollow cave, and  made of him then his latest meal. Three other sons Aegyptus  had, and one consorted with the wooers, namely Eurynomus,  but two continued in their father's fields; yet even so  forgat he not that son, still mourning and sorrowing. So  weeping for his sake he made harangue and spake among them:    'Hearken now to me, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I  shall say. Never hath our assembly or session been since  the day that goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships.  And now who was minded thus to assemble us? On what man  hath such sore need come, of the young men or of the elder  born? Hath he heard some tidings of the host now returning,  which he might plainly declare to us, for that he first  learned thereof, or doth he show forth and tell some other  matter of the common weal? Methinks he is a true man--good  luck be with him! Zeus vouchsafe him some good thing in his  turn, even all his heart's desire!'    So spake he, and the dear son of Odysseus was glad at the  omen of the word; nor sat he now much longer, but he burned  to speak, and he stood in mid assembly; and the herald  Peisenor, skilled in sage counsels, placed the staff in his  hands. Then he spake, accosting the old man first:    'Old man, he is not far off, and soon shalt thou know it  for thyself, he who called the folk together, even I: for  sorrow hath come to me in chief. Neither have I heard any  tidings of the host now returning, which I may plainly  declare to you, for that I first learned thereof; neither  do I show forth or tell any other matter of the common  weal, but mine own need, for that evil hath befallen my  house, a double woe. First, I have lost my noble sire, who  sometime was king among you here, and was gentle as a  father; and now is there an evil yet greater far, which  surely shall soon make grievous havoc of my whole house and  ruin all my livelihood. My mother did certain wooers beset  sore against her will, even the sons of those men that here  are the noblest. They are too craven to go to the house of  her father Icarius, that he may himself set the bride-price  for his daughter, and bestow her on whom he will, even on  him who finds favour in his sight. But they resorting to  our house day by day sacrifice oxen and sheep and fat  goats, and keep revel, and drink the dark wine recklessly,  and lo, our great wealth is wasted, for there is no man now  alive such as Odysseus was, to keep ruin from the house. As  for me I am nowise strong like him to ward mine own; verily  to the end of my days {*} shall I be a weakling and all  unskilled in prowess. Truly I would defend me if but  strength were mine; for deeds past sufferance have now been  wrought, and now my house is wasted utterly beyond pretence  of right. Resent it in your own hearts, and have regard to  your neighbours who dwell around, and tremble ye at the  anger of the gods, lest haply they turn upon you in wrath  at your evil deeds. {Or, lest they bring your evil deeds in  wrath on your own heads.} I pray you by Olympian Zeus and  by Themis, who looseth and gathereth the meetings of men,  let be, my friends, and leave me alone to waste in bitter  grief;-- unless it so be that my father, the good Odysseus,  out of evil heart wrought harm to the goodly-greaved  Achaeans, in quittance whereof ye now work me harm out of  evil hearts, and spur on these men. Better for me that ye  yourselves should eat up my treasures and my flocks. Were  YE so to devour them, ere long would some recompense be  made, for we would urge our plea throughout the town,  begging back our substance, until all should be restored.  But now without remedy are the pains that ye lay up in my  heart.'    {* Cf. B. xxi. 131. For the use of the 1st pers. pl. like  our ROYAL plural, cf. B. xvi.44, Il. vii. 190.}    So spake he in wrath, and dashed the staff to the ground,  and brake forth in tears; and pity fell on all the people.  Then all the others held their peace, and none had the  heart to answer Telemachus with hard words, but Antinous  alone made answer, saying:    'Telemachus, proud of speech and unrestrained in fury, what  is this thou hast said to put us to shame, and wouldest  fasten on us reproach? Behold the fault is not in the  Achaean wooers, but in thine own mother, for she is the  craftiest of women. For it is now the third year, and the  fourth is fast going by, since she began to deceive the  minds of the Achaeans in their breasts. She gives hope to  all, and makes promises to every man, and sends them  messages, but her mind is set on other things. And she hath  devised in her heart this wile besides; she set up in her  halls a mighty web, fine of woof and very wide, whereat she  would weave, and anon she spake among us:    '\"Ye princely youths, my wooers, now that the goodly  Odysseus is dead, do ye abide patiently, how eager soever  to speed on this marriage of mine, till I finish the robe.  I would not that the threads perish to no avail, even this  shroud for the hero Laertes, against the day when the  ruinous doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at  their length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the  land count it blame in me, as well might be, were he to lie  without a winding-sheet, a man that had gotten great  possessions.\"    'So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So  then in the day time she would weave the mighty web, and in  the night unravel the same, when she had let place the  torches by her. Thus for the space of three years she hid  the thing by craft and beguiled the minds of the Achaeans;  but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came  round, then at the last one of her women who knew all  declared it, and we found her unravelling the splendid web.  Thus she finished it perforce and sore against her will.  But as for thee, the wooers make thee answer thus, that  thou mayest know it in thine own heart, thou and all the  Achaeans! Send away thy mother, and bid her be married to  whomsoever her father commands, and whoso is well pleasing  unto her. But if she will continue for long to vex the sons  of the Achaeans, pondering in her heart those things that  Athene hath given her beyond women, knowledge of all fair  handiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles--so be it! Such  wiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the  women of old did know, of those that aforetime were  fair-tressed Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene  with the bright crown. Not one of these in the imaginations  of their hearts was like unto Penelope, yet herein at least  her imagining was not good. For in despite of her the  wooers will devour thy living and thy substance, so long as  she is steadfast in such purpose as the gods now put within  her breast: great renown for herself she winneth, but for  thee regret for thy much livelihood. But we will neither go  to our own lands, nor otherwhere, till she marry that man  whom she will of the Achaeans.'    Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: 'Antinous, I may  in no wise thrust forth from the house, against her will,  the woman that bare me, that reared me: while as for my  father he is abroad on the earth, whether he be alive or  dead. Moreover it is hard for me to make heavy restitution  to Icarius, as needs I must, if of mine own will I send my  mother away. For I shall have evil at his hand, at the hand  of her father, and some god will give me more besides, for  my mother will call down the dire Avengers as she departs  from the house, and I shall have blame of men; surely then  I will never speak this word. Nay,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#7)"],[1," thought, too. There  are likewise whole screeds of symbols waiting, perhaps waiting for  ever, to be interpreted. The dots and lines and pothooks clearly belong  to a system of picture-writing. Can we make out their meaning at all?  Once in a way, perhaps. Note these marks looking like two different  kinds of throwing-club; at any rate, there are Australian weapons not  unlike them. To the left of them are a lot of dots in what look like  patterns, amongst which we get twice over the scheme of one dot in  the centre of a circle of others. Then, farther still to the left,  comes the painted figure of a bison; or, to be more accurate, the front  half is painted, the back being a piece of protruding rock that gives  the effect of low relief. The bison is rearing back on its haunches,  and there is a patch of red paint, like an open wound, just over the  region of its heart. Let us try to read the riddle. It may well embody  a charm that ran somewhat thus: \"With these weapons, and by these  encircling tactics, may we slay a fat bison, O ye powers of the dark!\"  Depend upon it, the men who went half a mile into the bowels of a  mountain, to paint things up on the walls, did not do so merely for  fun. This is a very eerie place, and I daresay most of us would not  like to spend the night there alone; though I know a pre-historian  who did. In Australia, as we shall see later on, rock-paintings of  game-animals, not so lifelike as these of the old days, but symbolic  almost beyond all recognizing, form part of solemn ceremonies whereby  good hunting is held to be secured. Something of the sort, then, we  may suppose, took place ages ago in the cave of Niaux. So, indeed,  it was a cathedral after a fashion; and, having in mind the carven  pillars of stalactite, the curving alcoves and side-chapels, the  shining white walls, and the dim ceiling that held in scorn our powerful  lamps, I venture to question whether man has ever lifted up his heart  in a grander one.    Space would fail me if I now sought to carry you off to the cave of  Altamira, near Santander, in the north-west of Spain. Here you might  see at its best a still later style of rock-painting, which deserts  mere black and white for colour-shading of the most free description.  Indeed, it is almost too free, in my judgment; for, though the control  of the artist over his rude material is complete, he is inclined to  turn his back on real life, forcing the animal forms into attitudes  more striking than natural, and endowing their faces sometimes, as  it seems to me, with almost human expressions. Whatever may be thought  of the likelihood of these beasts being portrayed to look like men,  certain it is that in the painted caves of this period the men almost  invariably have animal heads, as if they were mythological beings,  half animal and half human; or else--as perhaps is more  probable--masked dancers. At one place, however--namely, in the rock  shelter of Cogul near Lerida, on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees,  we have a picture of a group of women dancers who are not masked, but  attired in the style of the hour. They wear high hats or chignons,  tight waists, and bell-shaped skirts. Really, considering that we thus  have a contemporary fashion-plate, so to say, whilst there are likewise  the numerous stencilled hands elsewhere on view, and even, as I have  seen with my own eyes at Niaux in the sandy floor, hardened over with  stalagmite, the actual print of a foot, we are brought very near to  our palaeolithic forerunners; though indefinite ages part them from  us if we reckon by sheer time.           *       *       *       *       *    Before ending this chapter, I have still to make good a promise to  say something about the neolithic men of western Europe. These people  often, though not always, polished their stone; the palaeolithic folk  did not. That is the distinguishing mark by which the world is pleased  to go. It would be fatal to forget, however, that, with this trifling  difference, go many others which testify more clearly to the contrast  between the older and newer types of culture. Thus it has still to  be proved that the palaeolithic races ever used pottery, or that they  domesticated animals--for instance, the fat ponies which they were  so fond of eating; or that they planted crops. All these things did  the neolithic peoples sooner or later; so that it would not be strange  if palaeolithic man withdrew in their favour, because he could not  compete. Pre-history is at present almost silent concerning the manner  of his passing. In a damp and draughty tunnel, however, called Mas  d'Azil, in the south of France, where the river Arize still bores its  way through a mountain, some palaeolithic folk seem to have lingered  on in a sad state of decay. The old sureness of touch in the matter  of carving bone had left them. Again, their painting was confined to  the adorning of certain pebbles with spots and lines, curious objects,  that perhaps are not without analogy in Australia, whilst something  like them crops up again in the north of Scotland in what seems to  be the early iron-age. Had the rest of the palaeolithic men already  followed the reindeer and other arctic animals towards the north-east?  Or did the neolithic invasion, which came from the south, wipe out  the lot? Or was there a commingling of stocks, and may some of us have  a little dose of palaeolithic blood, as we certainly have a large dose  of neolithic? To all these questions it can only be replied that we  do not yet know.    No more do we know half as much as we should like about fifty things  relating to the small, dark, long-headed neolithic folk, with a  language that has possibly left traces in the modern Basque, who spread  over the west till they reached Great Britain--it probably was an  island by this time--and erected the well-known long barrows and other  monuments of a megalithic (great-stone) type; though not the round  barrows, which are the work of a subsequent round-headed race of the  bronze-age. Every day, however, the spade is adding to our knowledge.  Besides, most of the ruder peoples of the modern world were at the  neolithic stage of culture at the time of their discovery by Europeans.  Hence the weapons, the household utensils, the pottery, the  pile-dwellings, and so on, can be compared closely; and we have a fresh  instance of the way in which one branch of anthropology can aid another.    In pursuance of my plan, however, of merely pitching here and there  on an illustrative point, I shall conclude by an excursion to Brandon,  just on the Suffolk side of the border between that county and Norfolk.  Here we can stand, as it were, with one foot in neolithic times and  the other in the life of to-day. When Canon Greenwell, in 1870, explored  in this neighbourhood one of the neolithic flint-mines known as Grime's  Graves, he had to dig out the rubbish from a former funnel-shaped pit  some forty feet deep. Down at this level, it appeared, the neolithic  worker had found the layer of the best flint. This he quarried by means  of narrow galleries in all directions. For a pick he used a red-deer's  antler. In the British Museum is to be seen one of these with the miner's  thumb-mark stamped on a piece of clay sticking to the handle. His lamp  was a cup of chalk. His ladder was probably a series of rough steps  cut in the sides of the pit. As regards the use to which the material  was put, a neolithic workshop was found just to the south of Grime's  Graves. Here, scattered about on all sides, were the cores, the  hammer-stones that broke them up, and knives, scrapers, borers,  spear-heads and arrow-heads galore, in all stages of manufacture.    Well, now let us hie to Lingheath, not far off, and what do we find?  A family of the name of Dyer carry on to-day exactly the same old method  of mining. Their pits are of squarer shape than the neolithic ones,  but otherwise similar. Their one-pronged pick retains the shape of  the deer's antler. Their light is a candle stuck in a cup of chalk.  And the ladder is just a series of ledges or, as they call them, \"toes\"  in the wall, five feet apart and connected by foot-holes. The miner  simply jerks his load, several hundredweight of flints, from ledge  to ledge by the aid of his head, which he protects with something that  neolithic man was probably without, namely, an old bowler hat. He even  talks a language of his own. \"Bubber-hutching on the sosh\" is the term  for sinking a pit on the slant, and, for all we can tell, may have  a very ancient pedigree. And what becomes of the miner's output? It  is sold by the \"jag\"--a jag being a pile just so high that when you  stand on any side you can see the bottom flint on the other--to the  knappers of Brandon. Any one of these--for instance, my friend Mr.  Fred Snare--will, while you wait, break up a lump with a short round  hammer into manageable pieces. Then, placing a \"quarter\" with his left  hand the leather pad that covers his knee, he will, with an oblong  hammer, strike off flake after flake, perhaps 1,500 in a morning; and  finally will work these up into sharp-edged squares to serve as  gun-flints for the trade with native Africa. Alas! the palmy days of  knapping gun-flints for the British Army will never return to Brandon.  Still, there must have been trade depression in those parts at any  time from the bronze-age up to the times of Brown Bess; for the  strike-a-lights, still to be got at a penny each, can have barely kept  the wolf from the door. And Mr. Snare is not merely an artisan but  an artist. He has chipped out a flint ring, a feat which taxed the  powers of the clever neolithic knappers of pre-dynastic Egypt; whilst  with one of his own flint fishhooks he has taken a fine trout from  the Little Ouse that runs by the town.    Thus there are things in old England that are older even than some  of our friends wot. In that one county of"]]]
