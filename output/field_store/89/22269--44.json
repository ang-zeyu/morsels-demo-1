He it is Who aided  Me, through the power of truth, during the days of My banishment in 'Iraq.  He it is Who overshadowed Me with His protection at a time when the  kindreds of the earth were contending with Me. He it is Who enabled Me to  depart out of the city, clothed with such majesty as none, except the  denier and the malicious, can fail to admit.    Say: My army is My reliance on God; My people, the force of My confidence  in Him. My love is My standard, and My companion the remembrance of God,  the Sovereign Lord of all, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the  Unconditioned.    Arise, O wayfarer in the path of the Love of God, and aid thou His Cause.  Say: Barter not away this Youth, O people, for the vanities of this world  or the delights of heaven. By the righteousness of the one true God! One  hair of Him excelleth all that is in the heavens and all that is on the  earth. Beware, O men, lest ye be tempted to part with Him in exchange for  the gold and silver ye possess. Let His love be a storehouse of treasure  for your souls, on the Day when naught else but Him shall profit you, the  Day when every pillar shall tremble, when the very skins of men shall  creep, when all eyes shall stare up with terror. Say: O people! Fear ye  God, and turn not away disdainfully from His Revelation. Fall prostrate on  your faces before God, and celebrate His praise in the daytime and in the  night season.    Let thy soul glow with the flame of this undying Fire that burneth in the  midmost heart of the world, in such wise that the waters of the universe  shall be powerless to cool down its ardor. Make, then, mention of thy  Lord, that haply the heedless among Our servants may be admonished through  thy words, and the hearts of the righteous be gladdened.            XVI: SAY: O MEN! THIS IS A MATCHLESS DAY....      Say: O men! This is a matchless Day. Matchless must, likewise, be the  tongue that celebrateth the praise of the Desire of all nations, and  matchless the deed that aspireth to be acceptable in His sight. The whole  human race hath longed for this Day, that perchance it may fulfil that  which well beseemeth its station, and is worthy of its destiny. Blessed is  the man whom the affairs of the world have failed to deter from  recognizing Him Who is the Lord of all things.    So blind hath become the human heart that neither the disruption of the  city, nor the reduction of the mountain in dust, nor even the cleaving of  the earth, can shake off its torpor. The allusions made in the Scriptures  have been unfolded, and the signs recorded therein have been revealed, and  the prophetic cry is continually being raised. And yet all, except such as  God was pleased to guide, are bewildered in the drunkenness of their  heedlessness!    Witness how the world is being afflicted with a fresh calamity every day.  Its tribulation is continually deepening. From the moment the  Suriy-i-Ra'is (Tablet to Ra'is) was revealed until the present day,  neither hath the world been tranquillized, nor have the hearts of its  peoples been at rest. At one time it hath been agitated by contentions and  disputes, at another it hath been convulsed by wars, and fallen a victim  to inveterate diseases. Its sickness is approaching the stage of utter  hopelessness, inasmuch as the true Physician is debarred from  administering the remedy, whilst unskilled practitioners are regarded with  favor, and are accorded full freedom to act. ...The dust of sedition hath  clouded the hearts of men, and blinded their eyes. Erelong, they will  perceive the consequences of what their hands have wrought in the Day of  God. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Informed, as bidden by One Who is  the Most Powerful, the Almighty.            XVII: BY HIM WHO IS THE GREAT ANNOUNCEMENT!...      By Him Who is the Great Announcement! The All-Merciful is come invested  with undoubted sovereignty. The Balance hath been appointed, and all them  that dwell on earth have been gathered together. The Trumpet hath been  blown, and lo, all eyes have stared up with terror, and the hearts of all  who are in the heavens and on the earth have trembled, except them whom  the breath of the verses of God hath quickened, and who have detached  themselves from all things.    This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. The workers  of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it. The moon of idle  fancy hath been cleft, and the heaven hath given out a palpable smoke. We  see the people laid low, awed with the dread of thy Lord, the Almighty,  the Most Powerful. The Crier hath cried out, and men have been torn away,  so great hath been the fury of His wrath. The people of the left hand sigh  and bemoan. The people of the right abide in noble habitations: they quaff  the Wine that is life indeed, from the hands of the All-Merciful, and are,  verily, the blissful.    The earth hath been shaken, and the mountains have passed away, and the  angels have appeared, rank on rank, before Us. Most of the people are  bewildered in their drunkenness and wear on their faces the evidences of  anger. Thus have We gathered together the workers of iniquity. We see them  rushing on towards their idol. Say: None shall be secure this Day from the  decree of God. This indeed is a grievous Day. We point out to them those  that led them astray. They see them, and yet recognize them not. Their  eyes are drunken; they are indeed a blind people. Their proofs are the  calumnies they uttered; condemned are their calumnies by God, the Help in  Peril, the Self-Subsisting. The Evil One hath stirred up mischief in their  hearts, and they are afflicted with a torment that none can avert. They  hasten to the wicked, bearing the register of the workers of iniquity.  Such are their doings.    Say: The heavens have been folded together, and the earth is held within  His grasp, and the corrupt doers have been held by their forelock, and  still they understand not. They drink of the tainted water, and know it  not. Say: The shout hath been raised, and the people have come forth from  their graves, and arising, are gazing around them. Some have made haste to  attain the court of the God of Mercy, others have fallen down on their  faces in the fire of Hell, while still others are lost in bewilderment.  The verses of God have been revealed, and yet they have turned away from  them. His proof hath been manifested, and yet they are unaware of it. And  when they behold the face of the All-Merciful, their own faces are  saddened, while they are disporting themselves. They hasten forward to  Hell Fire, and mistake it for light. Far from God be what they fondly  imagine! Say: Whether ye rejoice or whether ye burst for fury, the heavens  are cleft asunder, and God hath come down, invested with radiant  sovereignty. All created things are heard exclaiming: \"The Kingdom is  God's, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"    Know thou, moreover, that We have been cast into an afflictive Prison, and  are encompassed with the hosts of tyranny, as a result of what the hands  of the infidels have wrought. Such is the gladness, however, which the  Youth hath tasted that no earthly joy can compare unto it. By God! The  harm He suffereth at the hands of the oppressor can never grieve His  heart, nor can He be saddened by the ascendancy of such as have repudiated  His truth.    Say: Tribulation is a horizon unto My Revelation. The day star of grace  shineth above it, and sheddeth a light which neither the clouds of men's  idle fancy nor the vain imaginations of the aggressor can obscure.    Follow thou the footsteps of thy Lord, and remember His servants even as  He doth remember thee, undeterred by either the clamor of the heedless  ones or the sword of the enemy.... Spread abroad the sweet savors of thy  Lord, and hesitate not, though it be for less than a moment, in the  service of His Cause. The day is approaching when the victory of thy Lord,  the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful, will be proclaimed.            XVIII: SAY: WE HAVE CAUSED THE RIVERS OF DIVINE...      Say: We have caused the rivers of Divine utterance to proceed out of Our  throne, that the tender herbs of wisdom and understanding may spring forth  from the soil of your hearts. Will ye not be thankful? They who disdain to  worship their Lord shall be of those who are cast off. And oft as Our  verses are rehearsed unto them, they persist in proud disdain, and in  their gross violation of His law, and know it not. As for them who have  disbelieved in Him, they shall be in the shadow of a black smoke. \"The  Hour\" hath come upon them, while they are disporting themselves. They have  been seized by their forelock, and yet know it not.    The thing that must come hath come suddenly; behold how they flee from it!  The inevitable hath come to pass; witness how they have cast it behind  their backs! This is the Day whereon every man will fly from himself, how  much more from his kindred, could ye but perceive it. Say: By God! The  blast hath been blown on the trumpet, and lo, mankind hath swooned away  before us! The Herald hath cried out, and the Summoner raised His voice  saying: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Most Powerful, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting.\"    This is the Day on which all eyes shall stare up with terror, the Day in  which the hearts of them that dwell on earth shall tremble, save them whom  thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, pleaseth to deliver. All faces  have turned black except those to whom the God of Mercy hath vouchsafed a  radiant heart. Drunken are the eyes of those men that have openly refused  to behold the face of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.    Say: Perused ye not the Qur'an? Read it, that haply ye may find the Truth,  for this Book is verily the Straight Path.

Beware! Walk not with the ungodly and seek...\"      O SON OF DUST! Beware! Walk not with the ungodly and seek not fellowship  with him, for such companionship turneth the radiance of the heart into  infernal fire.        \"58: O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Wouldst thou seek the grace of the Holy  Spirit,...\"      O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Wouldst thou seek the grace of the Holy Spirit,  enter into fellowship with the righteous, for he hath drunk the cup of  eternal life at the hands of the immortal Cup-bearer and even as the true  morn doth quicken and illumine the hearts of the dead.        \"59: O HEEDLESS ONES! Think not the secrets of hearts are hidden, nay,...\"      O HEEDLESS ONES! Think not the secrets of hearts are hidden, nay, know ye  of a certainty that in clear characters they are engraved and are openly  manifest in the holy Presence.        \"60: O FRIENDS! Verily I say, whatsoever ye have concealed within...\"      O FRIENDS! Verily I say, whatsoever ye have concealed within your hearts  is to Us open and manifest as the day; but that it is hidden is of Our  grace and favor, and not of your deserving.        \"61: O SON OF MAN! A dewdrop out of the fathomless ocean of My...\"      O SON OF MAN! A dewdrop out of the fathomless ocean of My mercy I have  shed upon the peoples of the world, yet found none turn thereunto,  inasmuch as every one hath turned away from the celestial wine of unity  unto the foul dregs of impurity, and, content with mortal cup, hath put  away the chalice of immortal beauty. Vile is that wherewith he is  contented.        \"62: O SON OF DUST! Turn not away thine eyes from the matchless wine...\"      O SON OF DUST! Turn not away thine eyes from the matchless wine of the  immortal Beloved, and open them not to foul and mortal dregs. Take from  the hands of the divine Cup-bearer the chalice of immortal life, that all  wisdom may be thine, and that thou mayest hearken unto the mystic voice  calling from the realm of the invisible. Cry aloud, ye that are of low  aim! Wherefore have ye turned away from My holy and immortal wine unto  evanescent water?        \"63: O YE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD! Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity  followeth...\"      O YE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD! Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity  followeth you, and grievous retribution awaiteth you. Think not that which  ye have committed hath been effaced in My sight. By My beauty! All your  doings hath My pen graven with open characters upon tablets of chrysolite.        \"64: O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I  have...\"      O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I have  pledged Myself not to forgive any man's injustice. This is My covenant  which I have irrevocably decreed in the preserved tablet and sealed with  My seal.        \"65: O REBELLIOUS ONES! My forbearance hath emboldened you and My...\"      O REBELLIOUS ONES! My forbearance hath emboldened you and My  long-suffering hath made you negligent, in such wise that ye have spurred  on the fiery charger of passion into perilous ways that lead unto  destruction. Have ye thought Me heedless or that I was unaware?        \"66: O EMIGRANTS! The tongue I have designed for the mention of...\"      O EMIGRANTS! The tongue I have designed for the mention of Me, defile it  not with detraction. If the fire of self overcome you, remember your own  faults and not the faults of My creatures, inasmuch as every one of you  knoweth his own self better than he knoweth others.        \"67: O CHILDREN OF FANCY! Know, verily, that while the radiant dawn  breaketh...\"      O CHILDREN OF FANCY! Know, verily, that while the radiant dawn breaketh  above the horizon of eternal holiness, the satanic secrets and deeds done  in the gloom of night shall be laid bare and manifest before the peoples  of the world.        \"68: O WEED THAT SPRINGETH OUT OF DUST! Wherefore have not these soiled  hands of thine...\"      O WEED THAT SPRINGETH OUT OF DUST! Wherefore have not these soiled hands  of thine touched first thine own garment, and why with thine heart defiled  with desire and passion dost thou seek to commune with Me and to enter My  sacred realm? Far, far are ye from that which ye desire.        \"69: O CHILDREN OF ADAM! Holy words and pure and goodly deeds ascend...\"      O CHILDREN OF ADAM! Holy words and pure and goodly deeds ascend unto the  heaven of celestial glory. Strive that your deeds may be cleansed from the  dust of self and hypocrisy and find favor at the court of glory; for ere  long the assayers of mankind shall, in the holy presence of the Adored  One, accept naught but absolute virtue and deeds of stainless purity. This  is the daystar of wisdom and of divine mystery that hath shone above the  horizon of the divine will. Blessed are they that turn thereunto.        \"70: O SON OF WORLDLINESS! Pleasant is the realm of being, wert thou to  attain...\"      O SON OF WORLDLINESS! Pleasant is the realm of being, wert thou to attain  thereto; glorious is the domain of eternity, shouldst thou pass beyond the  world of mortality; sweet is the holy ecstasy if thou drinkest of the  mystic chalice from the hands of the celestial Youth. Shouldst thou attain  this station, thou wouldst be freed from destruction and death, from toil  and sin.        \"71: O MY FRIENDS! Call ye to mind that covenant ye have entered into...\"      O MY FRIENDS! Call ye to mind that covenant ye have entered into with Me  upon Mount Paran, situate within the hallowed precincts of Zaman. I have  taken to witness the concourse on high and the dwellers in the city of  eternity, yet now none do I find faithful unto the covenant. Of a  certainty pride and rebellion have effaced it from the hearts, in such  wise that no trace thereof remaineth. Yet knowing this, I waited and  disclosed it not.        \"72: O MY SERVANT! Thou art even as a finely tempered sword concealed...\"      O MY SERVANT! Thou art even as a finely tempered sword concealed in the  darkness of its sheath and its value hidden from the artificer's  knowledge. Wherefore come forth from the sheath of self and desire that  thy worth may be made resplendent and manifest unto all the world.        \"73: O MY FRIEND! Thou art the daystar of the heavens of My holiness,...\"      O MY FRIEND! Thou art the daystar of the heavens of My holiness, let not  the defilement of the world eclipse thy splendor. Rend asunder the veil of  heedlessness, that from behind the clouds thou mayest emerge resplendent  and array all things with the apparel of life.        \"74: O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY! For a fleeting sovereignty ye have abandoned  My...\"      O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY! For a fleeting sovereignty ye have abandoned My  imperishable dominion, and have adorned yourselves with the gay livery of  the world and made of it your boast. By My beauty! All will I gather  beneath the one-colored covering of the dust and efface all these diverse  colors save them that choose My own, and that is purging from every color.        \"75: O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE! Set not your affections on mortal  sovereignty...\"      O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE! Set not your affections on mortal sovereignty  and rejoice not therein. Ye are even as the unwary bird that with full  confidence warbleth upon the bough; till of a sudden the fowler Death  throws it upon the dust, and the melody, the form and the color are gone,  leaving not a trace. Wherefore take heed, O bondslaves of desire!        \"76: O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Guidance hath ever been given by words, and  now...\"      O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it  is given by deeds. Every one must show forth deeds that are pure and holy,  for words are the property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these  belong only to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to  distinguish yourselves by your deeds. In this wise We counsel you in this  holy and resplendent tablet.        \"77: O SON OF JUSTICE! In the night-season the beauty of the immortal...\"      O SON OF JUSTICE! In the night-season the beauty of the immortal Being  hath repaired from the emerald height of fidelity unto the  Sadratu'l-Muntaha, and wept with such a weeping that the concourse on high  and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at His lamenting. Whereupon  there was asked, Why the wailing and weeping? He made reply: As bidden I  waited expectant upon the hill of faithfulness, yet inhaled not from them  that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity. Then summoned to return I  beheld, and lo! certain doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws  of the dogs of earth. Thereupon the Maid of heaven hastened forth unveiled  and resplendent from Her mystic mansion, and asked of their names, and all  were told but one. And when urged, the first letter thereof was uttered,  whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth out of their  habitation of glory. And whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell  down, one and all, upon the dust. At that moment a voice was heard from  the inmost shrine: \"Thus far and no farther.\" Verily We bear witness to  that which they have done and now are doing.        \"78: O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Quaff from the tongue of the merciful the  stream...\"      O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Quaff from the tongue of the merciful the stream of  divine mystery, and behold from the dayspring of divine utterance the  unveiled splendor of the daystar of wisdom. Sow the seeds of My divine  wisdom in the pure soil of the heart, and water them with the waters of  certitude, that the hyacinths of knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh  and green from the holy city of the heart.        \"79: O SON OF DESIRE!
