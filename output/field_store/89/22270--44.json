The crime is on my side,  for not having observed the words of the sages, who say, 'When you  combat with one who flings clods of earth, you break your own head by  your folly: when you shoot at the face of your enemy, be careful that  you sit out of his aim.'\"--And not a little wit, too, did the kazi  exhibit when detected by the king in an intrigue with a farrier's  daughter, and his Majesty gave order that he should be flung from the  top of the castle, \"as an example for others\"; to which the kazi  replied: \"O monarch of the universe, I have been fostered in your  family, and am not singular in the commission of such crimes; therefore,  I ask you to precipitate some one else, in order that I may benefit by  the example.\" The king laughed at his wit, and spared his life.--Nor is  this tale without a spice of humour: An astrologer entered his house and  finding a stranger in company with his wife abused him, and called him  such opprobrious names that a quarrel and strife ensued. A shrewd man,  being informed of this, said to the astrologer: \"What do you know of the  heavenly bodies, when you cannot tell what goes on in your own  house?\"[10]--Last, and perhaps best of all, is this one: I was  hesitating about concluding a bargain for a house, when a Jew said: \"I  am an old householder in that quarter; inquire of me the description of  the house, and buy it, for it has no fault.\" I replied: \"Excepting that  you are one of the neighbours!\"       [10] There is a similar story to this in one of our old          English jest-books, _Tales and Quicke Answeres_, 1535,          as follows (I have modernised the spelling): As an          astronomer [i.e. an astrologer] sat upon a time in the          market place, and took upon him to divine and to show          what their fortunes and chances should be that came to          him, there came a fellow and told him (as it was indeed)          that thieves had broken into his house, and had borne          away all that he had. These tidings grieved him so sore          that, all heavy and sorrowfully, he rose up and went his          way. When the fellow saw him do so, he said: \"O thou          foolish and mad man! goest thou about to divine other          men's matters, and art ignorant of thine own?\"          III    ANECDOTES AND APHORISMS FROM THE \"GULISTAN,\" WITH ANALOGUES--CONCLUSION.      Besides the maxims comprised in the concluding chapter of the  _Gulistan_, under the heading of \"Rules for the Conduct of Life,\" many  others, of great pith and moment, are interspersed with the tales and  anecdotes which Saadi recounts in the preceding chapters, a selection of  which can hardly fail to prove both instructive and interesting.    It is related that at the court of Nushirvan, king of Persia, a number  of wise men were discussing a difficult question; and Buzurjmihr (his  famous prime minister), being silent, was asked why he did not take part  in the debate. He answered: \"Ministers are like physicians, and the  physician gives medicine to the sick only. Therefore, when I see your  opinions are judicious, it would not be consistent with wisdom for me to  obtrude my sentiments. When a matter can be managed without my  interference it is not proper for me to speak on the subject. But if I  see a blind man in the way of a well, should I keep silence it were a  crime.\" On another occasion, when some Indian sages were discoursing on  his virtue, they could discover in him only this fault, that he  hesitated in his speech, so that his hearers were kept a long time in  suspense before he delivered his sentiments. Buzurjmihr overheard their  conversation and observed: \"It is better to deliberate before I speak  than to repent of what I have said.\"[11]       [11] The sayings of Buzurjmihr, the sagacious prime minister          of King Nushirvan, are often cited by Persian writers,          and a curious story of his precocity when a mere youth          is told in the _Lata'yif at-Taw'ayif_, a Persian          collection, made by Al-Kashifi, of which a translation          will be found in my \"Analogues and Variants\" of the          Tales in vol. iii of Sir R. F. Burton's _Supplemental          Arabian Nights_, pp. 567-9--too long for reproduction          here.    A parallel to this last saying of the Persian vazir is found in a  \"notable sentence\" of a wise Greek, in this passage from the _Dictes, or  Sayings of Philosophers_, printed by Caxton (I have modernised the  spelling):    \"There came before a certain king three wise men, a Greek, a Jew, and a  Saracen, of whom the said king desired that each of them would utter  some good and notable sentence. Then the Greek said: 'I may well correct  and amend my thoughts, but not my words.' The Jew said: 'I marvel of  them that say things prejudicial, when silence were more profitable.'  The Saracen said: 'I am master of my words ere they are pronounced; but  when they are spoken I am servant thereto.' And it was asked one of  them: 'Who might be called a king?' And he answered: 'He that is not  subject to his own will.'\"    The _Dictes, or Sayings of Philosophers_, of which, I believe, but one  perfect copy is extant, was translated from the French by Earl Rivers,  and printed by Caxton, at Westminister, in the year 1477, as we learn  from the colophon. I am not aware that any one has taken the trouble to  trace to their sources all the sayings comprised in this collection, but  I think the original of the above is to be found in the following, from  the preface to the Arabian version (from the Pahlavi, the ancient  language of Persia) of the celebrated Fables of Bidpai, entitled _Kalila  wa Dimna_, made in the year 754:    \"The four kings of China, India, Persia, and Greece, being together,  agreed each of them to deliver a saying which might be recorded to their  honour in after ages. The king of China said: 'I have more power over  that which I have not spoken than I have to recall what has once passed  my lips.' The king of India: 'I have been often struck with the risk of  speaking; for if a man be heard in his own praise it is unprofitable  boasting, and what he says to his own discredit is injurious in its  consequences.' The king of Persia: 'I am the slave of what I have  spoken, but the master of what I conceal.' The king of Greece: 'I have  never regretted the silence which I had imposed upon myself; though I  have often repented of the words I have uttered;[12] for silence is  attended with advantage, whereas loquacity is often followed by  incurable evils.'\"       [12] Simonides used to say that he never regretted having          held his tongue, but very often had he felt sorry for          having spoken.--_Stobaeus_: Flor. xxxiii, 12.    The Persian poet Jami--the last of the brilliant galaxy of genius who  enriched the literature of their country, and who flourished two  centuries after Saadi had passed to his rest--reproduces these sayings  of the four kings in his work entitled _Baharistan_, or Abode of Spring,  which is similar in design to the _Gulistan_.    Among the sayings of other wise men (whose names, however, Saadi does  not mention) are the following: A devotee, who had quitted his monastery  and become a member of a college, being asked what difference there is  between a learned man and a religious man to induce him thus to change  his associates, answered: \"The devotee saves his own blanket out of the  waves, and the learned man endeavours to save others from drowning.\"--A  young man complained to his spiritual guide of his studies being  frequently interrupted by idle and impudent visitors, and desired to  know by what means he might rid himself of the annoyance. The sage  replied: \"To such as are poor lend money, and of such as are rich ask  money, and, depend upon it, you will never see one of them again.\"    Saadi's own aphorisms are not less striking and instructive. They are  indeed calculated to stimulate the faltering to manly exertion, and to  counsel the inexperienced. It is to youthful minds, however, that the  \"words of the wise\" are more especially addressed; for it is during the  spring-time of life that the seeds of good and evil take root; and so we  find the sage Hebrew king frequently addressing his maxims to the young:  \"My son,\" is his formula, \"my son, attend to my words, and bow thine ear  to my understanding; that thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy  lips may keep knowledge.\" And the \"good and notable sentences\" of Saadi  are well worthy of being treasured by the young man on the threshold of  life. For example:    \"Life is snow, and the summer advanceth; only a small portion remaineth:  art thou still slothful?\"    This warning has been reiterated by moralists in all ages and  countries;--the Great Teacher says: \"Work while it is day, for the night  cometh when no man can work.\" And Saadi, in one of his sermons (which is  found in another of his books), recounts this beautiful fable, in  illustration of the fortunes of the slothful and the industrious:    It is related that in a certain garden a Nightingale had built his nest  on the bough of a rose-bush. It so happened that a poor little Ant had  fixed her dwelling at the root of this same bush, and managed as best  she could to store her wretched hut of care with winter provision. Day  and night was the Nightingale fluttering round the rose-bower, and  tuning the barbut[13] of his soul-deluding melody; indeed, whilst the  Ant was night and day industriously occupied, the thousand-songed bird  seemed fascinated with his own sweet voice, echoing amidst the trees.  The Nightingale was whispering his secret to the Rose,[14] and that,  full-blown by the zephyr of the dawn, would ogle him in return. The poor  Ant could not help admiring the coquettish airs of the Rose, and the gay  blandishments of the Nightingale, and incontinently remarking: \"Time  alone can disclose "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#7)"],[1,"fling the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they  knew not,    S: And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah verifying that  which they have, a party of those who were given the Book threw the  Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing.    002.102  Y: They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power  of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones,  teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at Babylon to the  angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such  things) without saying: \"We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme.\"  They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife.  But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And  they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew  that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the  Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls,  if they but knew!    P: And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom  of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved,  teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in  Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they (the two angels) teach it to  anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore  disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two (angles)  people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife;  but they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn  that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know  that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the  Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their  souls, if they but knew.    S: And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign  of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans  disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two  angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until  they had said, \"Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a  disbeliever.\" Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they  might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot  hurt with it any one except with Allah's permission, and they learned  what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that  he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil  was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this.    002.103  Y: If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far  better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!    P: And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah  would be better, if they only knew.    S: And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against evil),  reward from Allah would certainly have been better; had they but known  (this).    002.104  Y: O ye of Faith! Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import,  but words of respect; and hearken (to him): To those without Faith is a  grievous punishment.    P: O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): \"Listen to us\" but say  \"Look upon us,\" and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful  doom.    S: O you who believe! do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen, and  for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement.    002.105  Y: It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the  Book, nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you  from your Lord. But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He  will - for Allah is Lord of grace abounding.    P: Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor  the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good  thing from your Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will,  and Allah is of Infinite Bounty.    S: Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not  like, nor do the polytheists, that the good should be sent down to you  from your Lord, and Allah chooses especially whom He pleases for His  mercy, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.    002.106  Y: None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but  We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah  Hath power over all things?    P: Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or  cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like  thereof. Knowest thou not that Allah is Able to do all things?    S: Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We  bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has  power over all things?    002.107  Y: Knowest thou not that to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens  and the earth? And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper.    P: Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty  of the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any  guardian or helper?    S: Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the  earth, and that besides Allah you have no guardian or helper?    002.108  Y: Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? but  whoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief, Hath strayed without doubt  from the even way.    P: Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned  aforetime? He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath  gone astray from a plain road.    S: Rather you wish to put questions to your Messenger, as Musa was  questioned before; and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith, he  indeed has lost the right direction of the way.    002.109  Y: Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you  (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy,  after the Truth hath become Manifest unto them: But forgive and  overlook, Till Allah accomplish His purpose; for Allah Hath power over  all things.    P: Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers  after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth  hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them)  until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.    S: Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back  into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even)  after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so  that Allah should bring about His command; surely Allah has power over  all things.    002.110  Y: And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good  ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah:  for Allah sees Well all that ye do.    P: Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send  before (you) for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is  Seer of what ye do.    S: And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good you send  before for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees  what you do.    002.111  Y: And they say: \"None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a  Christian.\" Those are their (vain) desires. Say: \"Produce your proof if  ye are truthful.\"    P: And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a  Christian. These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what  ye state) if ye are truthful.    S: And they say: None shall enter the garden (or paradise) except he who  is a Jew or a Christian. These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your  proof if you are truthful.    002.112  Y: Nay,- whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,-  He will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor  shall they grieve.    P: Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing  good, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon  them neither shall they grieve.    S: Yes! whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is the doer of  good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord, and there is no fear  for him nor shall he grieve.    002.113  Y: The Jews say: \"The Christians have naught (to stand) upon\"; and the  Christians say: \"The Jews have naught (To stand) upon.\" Yet they  (Profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those  say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on  the Day of Judgment.    P: And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing (true), and the  Christians say the Jews follow nothing (true); yet both are readers of  the Scripture. Even thus speak those who know not. Allah will judge  between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they  differ.    S: And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and  the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they  recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like  to what they say; so Allah shall judge between them on the day of  resurrection in what they differ.    002.114  Y: And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the  worship of Allah, Allah's name should be celebrated? - whose zeal is (in  fact) to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves  enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in  this world, and in the world to come, an exceeding torment.    P: And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the  sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and  striveth for their ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they  should enter them except in fear. Theirs in the world is ignominy and  theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom.    S: And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men) from the masjids of  Allah, that His name should be remembered in them, and strives to ruin  them? (As for) these, it was not proper"]]]
