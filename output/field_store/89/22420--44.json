For two centuries following came an  interval known as the Dark Ages, when none of the arts flourished.  But before the Moors had fled from Spain the Italians who lived near  at hand and whose territory the invaders often plundered had tired of  their pillaging and in return had made an expedition into the  Saracens' country bringing back with them to Italy some of the  Majolica ware of the Arabs. When the nations began to awaken out of  their two hundred years of warfare and strife, and Genoa, Venice, and  Leghorn became great commercial centres, then the Renaissance came and  the Italians, who were ever an ingenious people, began among other  things to attempt to copy the glaze on this Majolica ware. As a result  in the fifteenth century Luca della Robbia, who was both a sculptor  and a potter, contrived to perfect his wonderful glazed terra cotta.\"    \"Not the Delia Robbia who did the Singing Boys we have on the wall at  school!\"    \"The very same. He made great blue and white enameled tiles for wall  decoration too; figures of babies and children, as well as whole  altars fashioned entirely from this beautiful enamel. Whether he used  a plumbiferous, or lead glaze; or a stanniferous, or tin glaze, we do  not know. Probably it was of tin. But the important fact is that he  got a fine durable surface, very shiny and very hard, which wrought a  revolution in pottery-making. If you visit Florence some time you can  still see set in the walls of some of the public buildings the  identical enameled terra cottas made by Luca della Robbia.\"    \"I'd like to see them.\"    \"Then tell your dad to take you to Italy after this war is over. We  will pray that Germany may spare these art works of the world.\"    Mr. Croyden did not speak for a moment; then he said:    \"And while you are remembering so many things remember in addition  that the word _glaze_ comes from the term _glassing_ or _glazing_,  which means putting a coating of glass over the surface. Of course  the covering is not really glass, but it is hard and shiny, and so  people used to think it was. Some day I will tell you more about the  different kinds of glazes.\"    \"So it was the Italians who gave Europe its glazed pottery and  porcelain,\" remarked Theo.    \"Not alone the Italians,\" protested Mr. Croyden, \"although they  helped. Somebody else had a share in the discovery--somebody very far  away from Italy. It was the knowledge of the Italians combined with  the skill of this other distant nation that gave to Europe the perfect  product.\"    \"What nation was that?\" demanded Theo.    \"The Dutch.\"    \"The Dutch!\"    \"Yes. You see at this time the Dutch were great traders, and it was  while the nation was at the height of its commercial glory that the  Dutch began bringing from China shipments of Chinese porcelain.  Portuguese traders had also brought some of it into Europe, so in  these two ways the beautiful blue and white ware we know so well was  introduced to the Continent.    \"The Portuguese were content to import it; they never attempted to  copy either the pottery or the porcelain. But the Dutch were more  ambitious. As early as 1300 they began experimenting with glazed  pottery. To the knowledge of glaze which they got from Italy they  added all they could find out about the making of Chinese wares. They  learned that the blue color the Chinese got came from oxide of cobalt,  which would melt and mingle with the glaze when exposed to a high  temperature; they also learned a little--a very little, of the  clay. As a result they began to turn out a blue and white pottery  known as Delft, which they soon made in great quantities and sold to  European nations at a much lower price than imported Chinese potteries  and porcelains could be bought.\"    Mr. Croyden bent forward and tossed a small log upon the fire.    \"This fact revolutionized daily living throughout Europe. Up to this  time you must remember the common people everywhere were using square  pieces of tile or wood for plates, and were eating from wooden bowls  or hollowed out slabs of wood called trenchers. The more well-to-do  used pewter, and kings and queens dined from dishes of silver. There  was, it is true, some earthenware made in Saxony and France, but as it  was of a finer and more expensive quality than Delft ordinary persons  could not afford to buy it.    \"At the time the Dutch began importing their Delft ware into England  Henry IV was on the throne; so you see how long ago all this  happened.\"    Mr. Croyden smiled mischievously.    \"I suppose you have that date at your tongue's end,\" he added.    \"I think it was about 1400,\" ventured Theo thoughtfully.    \"Bravo! I had no idea you would remember it. Henry IV reigned from  1399 to 1413, so you see you are nearly right. As Delft ware began to  be manufactured in 1310 the art was pretty well developed by this  time, and much beautiful pottery was being made. Some of the best  Dutch painters were trying their hand at its decoration, and in the  Museums of the Hague there are old Delft pieces painted by many of  these famous artists. Most of the scenes upon them were copied from  the landscapes the Dutch saw every day--windmills, ships, Dutch women  in their quaint costumes, fishermen, and children in wooden  shoes,--the ordinary sights, such as were common in Holland, but novel  and interesting to those who lived in other places. There were, too,  many imitations of Chinese ware adorned with copies of Chinese  designs. Bear in mind, Theo, that all of this was pottery, not  porcelain; for the secret of porcelain-making had not yet been  fathomed,\" said Mr. Croyden impressively.    \"It was glazed pottery,\" responded Theo.    \"Exactly,\" nodded Mr. Croyden. \"As time went on the Dutch increased  and perfected their output until they became ambitious to make larger  pieces. Potters began turning out small foot-stoves, vases,  candlesticks, and dinner sets. One of the most amusing relics of this  old Delft is now in one of the foreign museums. It is a violin  perfectly modeled and exquisitely decorated. The story goes that it  was one of four such instruments which were made as wedding gifts for  the four daughters of a rich Dutch pottery manufacturer. It is even  asserted that the instruments before being presented to the four  brides were used by the musicians at the wedding festivities. I'm  afraid they did not make very good music.\"    Theo smiled.    \"Besides these fantastic things the Dutch also made tea sets, and when  I say that you must realize that this was a very important fact; for  up to about 1660 tea was a great novelty in England. It had but  recently been introduced there by Oriental traders, and was very  expensive, selling for about eight dollars a pound--at that time a  great deal of money, and even quite a price when rated by our own  standards. People were very ignorant still as to its use. You have  probably heard the story of the servant who, knowing nothing about  preparing the new delicacy, boiled the tea leaves, sprinkled them with  salt and pepper and, throwing away the liquid, served the dainty to  his master in a covered dish.\"    There was a hearty laugh from Theo.    \"As late as 1661 an Englishman named Samuel Pepys, whose diary is an  interesting record of the time, writes: '_I had to-day some tea--a  China drink of which I had never drank before._' Isn't it a pity that  while he was writing the little man did not also put down how he liked  this new beverage?\"    Mr. Croyden drew out his watch and rose.    \"So you can see, Theo,\" he added as he stood with his back to the  fire, \"what it meant to have tea sets introduced into England. Of  course the cups had no handles as do our teacups of to-day. The  Chinese cups were in reality small bowls without either saucer or  handle. Therefore the Delft teacups copied from them were made in the  same way. The Chinese did not drink their tea very hot, you see, and  therefore could take hold of the cup without burning their fingers;  moreover, they used in their houses tables of teak-wood to which hot  cups did no injury. Since, however, teak-wood was unknown in England  and oak was in general use the English found that the hot cups marred  their tables and later they invented saucers to go under  them. Nevertheless it was a long time before it dawned on potters that  they could make handles for their cups. One of the ear-marks of tea  sets of early manufacture is these handleless cups. With this advent  of dishes, of Delft plaques to be hung on the wall in place of  pictures, and of Delft tiles, many of the common people for the first  time awakened to the discovery that the interiors of their houses  might be made attractive, and something more than mere shelters from  cold and storm. They began buying vases and crude pottery ornaments,  images of flower-girls, fishermen, and of the saints. In Holland  people even hung Delft plaques on the walls of their stables. It was a  new thought to have anything about which was not for actual use.\"    \"I should think that with all this Chinese and Delft ware to copy from  the English would have tried making earthenware of their own,\"  speculated Theo.    \"They did,\" was Mr. Croyden's prompt reply, \"and of that I will tell  you some other day. But there is one interesting fact in connection  with these early tea sets. Remember that if ever you see in a museum  or private house a tea set which you are told came over in the  _Mayflower_ nothing of the sort could have happened. The Pilgrims  landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620, and it was not until from 1660 to  1770 that tea and tea sets became general in England. By that time the  Pilgrim Fathers, and more especially the Pilgrim Mothers, were far  across the ocean.\"    Mr. Croyden moved toward the door.    \"Some one may have brought tea sets to them but they never carried  them in the _Mayflower_,\" he concluded. \"Now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#7)"],[1,"which forms the lowest stage of the front it is second only to Wells  amongst English cathedrals. The actual west wall of the church is the  work of Bishop Grandisson, who formed on the south side of the central  doorway the small chapel of St. Radegunde as a burial place for himself.  The greater part of the end wall of the nave is filled by a large window  with remarkably beautiful tracery in its head. The date must be about  1350. Above this is a battlemented parapet sloped at each end to follow  the lines of the aisle-roofs. Above this parapet appears the gable of  the main roof in which is inserted a triangular window, with elegant  tracery, lighting the space between the vault and outer roof. At the  apex of the gable is a niche containing a small statue of St. Peter.    The screen, which forms the lowest stage of this front, must have been  finished in Brantyngham's time, though it seems probable that it was  designed if not begun by Grandisson. It contains eighty-eight figures,  in three rows, representing angels, warriors, kings, and saints. Their  costume and armour are characteristic of the fashions of Richard II.'s  reign. The lowest row consists of angelic figures each sustaining a  triple pilaster with capitals. On these capitals stand the statues of  the second row, a long line of knights and kings, above which are the  angels and apostles of the third row. Above the third row stand two  figures, said to represent Athelstan and Edward the Confessor. The  former once drove out the Britons from the city; the latter, as we know,  founded the bishopric.    This group of statues has been the subject of a monograph by Miss E.K.  Prideaux, who shows that the intention was to symbolize the Heavenly  Jerusalem, where angels, saints, and monarchs unite to honour the  enthroned Saviour and His Blessed Mother, who, as representative of the  Church Triumphant, is being crowned by her Son. The Coronation of the  Virgin was depicted in the central group immediately over the great  doorway, the figures being those of St. Peter, Our Lady, Our Lord, and  St. Paul. At some unknown date the statue of the Virgin was destroyed,  and a figure intended to represent Richard II was substituted in 1818.  Two other figures, assigned to James the Less and King William I, are  modern reproductions by Alfred Stevens; some new heads were also added.  Many circumstances have combined with the action of time to injure these  sculptures: but the general effect is rich if somewhat heavy. Above the  screen is a platform, from which the bishop probably blessed the people,  and the minstrels welcomed with song the approach of royal or  illustrious visitors.    The three doorways in the screen are worthy of notice, being richly  decorated. That on the south side is the most beautiful, and contains  two fine pieces of sculpture, one generally declared to be an angel  appearing to Joseph in a dream, the other certainly recording the  Adoration of the Shepherds. The central porch is decorated with  sculptured foliage, and the Crucifixion is exhibited on the central boss  of the groined roof tracery.    [Illustration: PORTALS OF WEST FRONT.

Fine as is the exterior, the interior of the building is quite as  beautiful. Restoration of an unusually careful and discreet style has  done much to revive the deteriorated splendours of the place. Sixty  years ago the nave was filled with hideous and cumbersome pews, and such  work as had been done towards keeping the place in repair was in the  worst possible taste. But a change has been wrought of the happiest kind  in recent years, so that no cathedral in the country can boast a more  admirable interior.    It has been the custom to deplore the lack of elevation, and its lowness  has compelled comparisons with the cathedrals of France. But this  objection is, surely, rather trivial. For though the long vaulted roof,  uninterrupted the whole length of the building, might tend to take away  from the appearance of height, the work on the roof itself, the delicate  ornaments on capitals and windows, do much to atone for this effect. To  the ordinary visitor, it may safely be asserted, lack of height will  only be obvious when pointed out to him.    #The Nave.#--Little of the Norman masonry is now to be seen, yet it is  clear that when Marshall completed Warelwast's design he found the nave  finished. To quote Canon Freeman, whose book, too technical for the  general public, is of incalculable value to the student: \"On the  interior face of both north and south walls of the nave aisles,  disturbances of masonry occurring at regular intervals indicate the  position of a series of Norman pilasters, the base of one of them having  recently been found _in situ_ beneath the stone seat. Outside, and  corresponding to the position of each several pilaster, may be observed  either flat buttresses of Norman form and masonry, or else traces of  their removal. These remains, linking together the obviously Norman  towers and the massive west wall, point to the conclusion that the  Norman cathedral, as Marshall found it, included the entire nave.\"    When the changes began, the Fabric Rolls, if they \"do not entirely  desert us,\" give us but meagre help, so that the exact date and cost of  each detail is only to be guessed at. Stapledon probably intended, as  early as 1325, to begin the work of recasting the nave. In that year he  made purchases of \"15 great poplar trees bought for scaffolds, and 100  alder trees.\" Further entries tell us of seven and eightpence worth of  timber \"bought by the Bishop at London,\" and \"48 great trees from  Langford.\" The work hitherto attempted by Stapledon did not demand an  outlay of this kind; so, though Grandisson gets the honour of having  finished the nave, something is due to Stapledon for having given the  initiative. The large balances of the preceding nine years had left a  great sum of money in the latter's hands, and a donation of Stapledon's  further increased that balance by the substantial sum of L600. In  January, 1333, is a record of William Canon's bill for marble he had  been commissioned to furnish. He had agreed to supply the Purbeck  pillars for the nave, receiving L10 16s. for eleven large columns, and  5s. a-piece for bases and capitals. This is one of the most interesting  items we have of the building and cost of the cathedral, and occurs  fortunately at a time when such information is unusually scanty. In  addition to the above-mentioned Purbeck marble, stone from the quarries  of Caen in Normandy, and other places nearer home, was procured in large  quantities. In 1338 the bishop gave permission to the Dean and Chapter  to obtain from his agents at Chudleigh \"twelve suitable oaks from his  wood there.\" About 1350 the building of the nave was completed. It was  extensively restored in recent years under the guidance of Sir Gilbert  Scott. The Purbeck columns had fallen into a most dilapidated state, and  were carefully repaired, the material used being obtained from those  spots which had supplied the original builders.    The view of the nave as one enters the west door is most impressive. Its  full height of seventy feet is not dwarfed by the unhindered stretch of  roof. The groined and ribbed roof itself is of marvellous beauty and  springs from slender vaulting shafts, of which the bosses are  exquisitely carved with a strange mixture of religious and legendary  figures, foliage and animals. The artists seem to have ransacked the  whole universe for subjects, and to have interpreted their ideas with  great cunning. The corbels that support the vaulting shafts are equally  elaborately carved.    [Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING WEST.                 The Photochrom Co.

(See Prideaux and Shafto, \"Bosses and                 Corbels of Exeter Cathedral.\")]    They consist of figures and foliage, and the variety of subjects chosen  is no less surprising than the skill the artists have shown in the  realization of their ideas. Whether they are peculiar to Exeter or not,  it may be safely said that one could not easily find their equals either  in design or execution. The subjects treated are too numerous for  detailed treatment in this place, but the carving of vines and acorns  and oakleaves will be readily admired.    [Illustration: THE MINSTRELS' GALLERY.                 The Photochrom Co. Photo.]    The nave has seven bays, and the arcades are supported by clustered  pillars of Purbeck marble, showing various tints of blue and grey. There  are sixteen shafts in each pier corresponding with the eight subordinate  mouldings in each pair of arches, and the diagonal position of each  cluster adds much to its graceful appearance. In the retro-choir there  are earlier examples of this kind of pier, showing how the builders  experimented with the grouping of the shafts before they attained the  perfect proportions of the pillars in the nave and choir. It seems that  they utilized the Norman pillars as the central core round which to  group the Purbeck shafts. The triforium, in groups of four arches, is  unusually low, and rests on small clustered columns, broken in one place  only on the north side to make way for the Minstrels' Gallery.    #The Minstrels' Gallery.#--This is the most beautiful gallery of its  kind to "]]]
