For India's mythology, its religion and its abstrusest of  philosophies he felt nothing but aversion. Especially hateful to him  were the mythological monstrosities:        Und so will ich, ein fuer allemal,      Keine Bestien in dem Goettersaal!      Die leidigen Elephantenruessel,      Das umgeschlungene Schlangengenuessel,      Tief Urschildkroet' im Weltensumpf,      Viel Koenigskoepf' auf einem Rumpf,      Die muessen uns zur Verzweiflung bringen,      Wird sie nicht reiner Ost verschlingen.[98]    Goethe classed Indic antiquities with those of Egypt and China, and his  attitude towards the question of their value is distinctly expressed in  one of his prose proverbs: \"Chinesische, Indische, Aegyptische  Altertuemer sind immer nur Curiositaeten: es ist sehr wohl gethan, sich  und die Welt damit bekannt zu machen; zu sittlicher und aesthetischer  Bildung aber werden sie uns wenig fruchten.\"[99]    After all, Goethe's Orient did not extend beyond the Indus. It was  confined mainly to Persia and Arabia, with an occasional excursion into  Turkey.    To this Orient he turned at the time of Germany's deepest political  degradation, when the best part of its soil was overrun by a foreign  invader, and when the whole nation nerved itself for the life and death  struggle that was to break its chains. The aged poet shrank from the  tumult and strife about him and took refuge in the East. The opening  lines of the first Divan poem express the motive of this poetical  _Hegire_.    The history of the composition of the _Divan_ is too well known to  require repetition. It is given with great detail in the editions  prepared by von Loeper and Duentzer.[100] Suffice it to say that the  direct impulse to the composition of the work was the appearance, in  1812, of the first complete version of Persia's greatest lyric poet  Hafid, by the famous Viennese Orientalist von Hammer. The bulk of the  poems were written between the years 1814 and 1819,[101] although in  the work as we now have it a number of poems are included which arose  later than 1819 and were added to the editions of 1827 and 1837.[102]    The idea of dividing the collection into books was suggested by the fact  that two of Hafid's longer poems bear the titles [Arabic]  i.e. \"book of the cup-bearer\" and \"book of the minstrel,\" as well as by  the seven-fold division which Sir William Jones had made of Oriental  poetry.[103] For the heroic there was no material, nor were some of the  other divisions suitable for Goethe's purpose. So only the _Buch der  Liebe_ and the _Buch des Unmuts_ (to correspond to satire) could be  formed. Other books were formed in an analogous manner until they were  twelve in number. The poet originally intended to make them of equal  length, but this intention he never carried out, and so they are of very  unequal extent, the longest being that of _Suleika_ (53 poems) and the  shortest those of Timur and of the Parsi (two poems each).    The great majority of the Divan-poems are not in any sense translations  or reproductions, but entirely original compositions inspired by the  poet's Oriental reading and study. The thoroughness and earnestness of  these studies is attested by the explanatory notes which were added to  the _Divan_ and were published with it in 1819,[104] and which show  conclusively, that, although Goethe could not read Persian poetry in the  original, he nevertheless succeeded admirably in entering into its  spirit.    We have mentioned Hammer's translation of Hafid as the direct impulse  to the composition of the _Divan_. It was also the principal source from  which the poet drew his inspiration for the work. A single verse would  often furnish a theme for a poem. Sometimes this poem would be a  translation, e.g. \"Eine Stelle suchte der Liebe Schmerz,\" p. 54 (H.  356. 8); but more often it was a very free paraphrase, e.g. the motto  prefixed to _Buch Hafis_, a variation of the motto to Hammer's version  (H. 222. 9). As an example of how a single verse is developed into an  original poem we may cite \"Ueber meines Liebchens Aeugeln,\" p. 55, where  the first stanza is a version of H. 221. 1, all the others being free  invention. Other Persian poets besides Hafid also furnished material.  Thus the opening passage of Sa'di's _Gulistan_ was used for \"Im  Athemholen,\" p. 10, where the sense, however, is altered and the line  \"So sonderbar ist das Leben gemischt\" is added. A number of poems are  based on the _Pand Namah_ of 'Attar, e.g. pp. 58, 60,[105] and two are  taken from Firdausi, namely \"Firdusi spricht,\" p. 75 (Sh. N. i. p. 62,  couplet 538; Mohl, i. 84; Fundgruben. ii. 64) and \"Was machst du an der  Welt?\" p. 96 (Sh. N. i. p. 482, coupl. 788, 789; _Red._ p. 58). But it  was not only the poetical works of Persia that were laid under  contribution; sayings, anecdotes, descriptions, remarks of any kind in  books of travel and the like were utilized as well. Thus Hammer in the  preface to his version of Hafid relates the _fatva_ or judgment which a  famous _mufti_ of Constantinople pronounced on the poems of the great  singer, and this gave Goethe the idea for his \"Fetwa,\" p. 32.[106] In  the same preface[107] is related the well known reply which Hafid is  reported to have given to Timur, when called to account by the latter  for the sentiment of the first couplet of the famous eighth ode, and  this inspired the poem \"Haett' ich irgend wol Bedenken,\" p. 133.  Similarly \"Vom heutigen Tag,\" p. 94, is based on the words of an  inscription over a caravansery at Ispahan found in Chardin's book. The  story of Bahramgur and Dilaram inventing rhyme[108] gave rise to the  poem \"Behramgur, sagt man,\" p. 153. And so we might cite poems from  other sources, _Quran_, Jones' _Poeseos_, Diez' _Buch des Kabus_, etc.,  but the examples we have given are sufficient to show how Goethe used  his material.    Throughout the _Divan_ Persian similes and metaphors are copiously  employed and help to create a genuine Oriental atmosphere. The adoration  of the dust on the path of the beloved, p. 23 (cf. H. 497. 10); the  image of the candle that is consumed by the flame as the lover is by  yearning, p. 54 (cf. H. 414. 4); the love of the nightingale for the  rose, p. 125 (cf. H. 318. 1); the lover captive in the maiden's  tresses, p. 46 (cf. H. 338. 1); the arrows of the eye lashes, p. 129  (cf. H. 173. 2); the verses strung together like pearls, p. 193 (cf.  H. 499. 11), are some of the peculiarly Persian metaphors that occur.  Allusions to the loves of Yusuf and Zalicha, of Laila and Majnun and of  other Oriental couples are repeatedly brought in. Moreover, a whole book  is devoted to the _saqi_ so familiar to students of Hafid, and Goethe  does not shrink from alluding to the subject of boy-love, p. 181.    A great many of the poems, however, do not owe their inspiration to the  Orient, and many are completely unoriental. Such are, for instance,  those of the _Randsch Namah_, expressing, as they do, Goethe's opinions  on contemporary literary and aesthetic matters. Again, many are inspired  by personal experiences, and, as is now well known, the whole _Buch  Suleika_ owes its origin to the poet's love for Marianne von Willemer;  some of its finest poems have been proved to have been written by this  gifted lady. Such poems, written under the impressions of some actual  occurrence, were sometimes subsequently orientalized. Some striking  illustrations of this are given by Burdach in the essay which we cited  before and to which we refer.    As the _Divan_ was an original work, though inspired by Oriental  sources, Goethe did not feel the necessity of imitating the extremely  artificial forms of his Oriental models. Besides, he knew of these forms  only indirectly through the work of Jones. What Hammer's versions could  teach him on this point was certainly very little. Perhaps he did not  realize what an essential element form is in Persian poetry, that, in  fact, it generally predominates over the thought, and this so much that  the unity of a _gazal_ is entirely dependent on the recurrence of the  rhyme. Instead of such recurrent rhyme he employs changing rhyme and  free strophes. Only twice does he attempt anything like an imitation of  the _gazal_, but in neither case does he satisfy the technical rules of  this poetic form.[109]    From all this we see that Goethe in the _Divan_ preserves his poetic  independence. He remains a citizen of the West, though he chooses to  dwell for a time in the East. As a rule he takes from there only what he  finds congenial to his own nature. So we can understand his attitude  towards mysticism. He has no love for it; it was utterly incompatible  with his own habit of clear thinking. Speaking of Rumi, the prince of  mystics, he doubts if this poet could give a clear account of his own  doctrine;[110] the grades by which, according to Sufi-doctrine, man  rises to ultimate union with the Godhead he calls follies.[111]  Therefore to him Hafid was the singer of real love, real roses and real  wine, and this conception of the great lyric poet was also adopted by  all the later Hafizian singers.[112] Unfortunately it cannot be said  that it is quite correct. For even if we ignore the mystical  interpretation which Oriental commentators give to the wine of Hafid,  we cannot possibly ignore the fact that the love of which he sings is  never the ideal love for woman, but mostly the love for a handsome  boy.[113]    With the _Divan_ Goethe inaugurated the Oriental movement in German  poetry, which Rueckert, Platen and Bodenstedt carried to its culmination.  These later Hafizian singers remembered gratefully what they owed the  sage of Weimar. Rueckert pays his tribute to him in the opening poem of  his _Oestliche Rosen_, where he hails him as lord of the East as he has  been the star of the West.[114] And Platen offers to him reverentially"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#7)"],[1,"him to force, and found myself looking under a low  arch, with the Thames beyond, and a few hazy lights coming and going  on the opposite bank.    \"Go steady!\" warned Fletcher. \"It's only a few paces to the edge of  the wharf.\"    I heard him taking a box of matches from his pocket.    \"Here is my electric lamp,\" I said. \"It will serve the purpose better.\"    \"Good,\" muttered my companion. \"Show a light down here, so that we  can find our way.\"    With the aid of the lamp we found our way out on to the rotting  timbers of the crazy structure. The mist hung denser over the river,  but through it, as through a dirty gauze curtain, it was possible  to discern some of the greater lights on the opposite shore. These,  without exception, however, showed high up upon the fog curtain;  along the water level lay a belt of darkness.    \"Let me give them the signal,\" said Fletcher, shivering slightly and  taking the lamp from my hand.    He flashed the light two or three times. Then we both stood watching  the belt of darkness that followed the Surrey shore. The tide lapped  upon the timbers supporting the wharf and little whispers and gurgling  sounds stole up from beneath our feet. Once there was a faint splash  from somewhere below and behind us.    \"There goes a rat,\" said Fletcher vaguely, and without taking his gaze  from the darkness under the distant shore. \"It's gone into the cutting  at the back of John Ki's.\"    He ceased speaking and flashed the lamp again several times. Then, all  at once out of the murky darkness into which we were peering, looked  a little eye of light--once, twice, thrice it winked at us from low  down upon the oily water; then was gone.    \"It's Weymouth with the cutter,\" said Fletcher; \"they are ready ...  now for Jon Ki's.\"    We stumbled back up the slight acclivity beneath the archway to the  street, leaving the ruinous gates as we had found them. Into the  uninviting little alley immediately opposite we plunged, and where  the faint yellow luminance showed upon the muddy path before us,  Fletcher paused a moment, whispering to me warningly.    \"Don't speak if you can help it,\" he said; \"if you do, mumble any old  jargon in any language you like, and throw in plenty of cursing!\"    He grasped me by the arm, and I found myself crossing the threshold of  the Joy-Shop--I found myself in a meanly furnished room no more than  twelve feet square and very low ceiled, smelling strongly of paraffin  oil. The few items of furniture which it contained were but dimly  discernible in the light of a common tin lamp which stood upon a  packing-case at the head of what looked like cellar steps.    Abruptly, I pulled up; for this stuffy little den did not correspond  with pre-conceived ideas of the place for which we were bound. I was  about to speak when Fletcher nipped my arm--and out from the shadows  behind the packing-case a little bent figure arose!    I started violently, for I had had no idea that another was in the  room. The apparition proved to be a Chinaman, and judging from what I  could see of him, a very old Chinaman, his bent figure attired in a  blue smock. His eyes were almost invisible amidst an intricate map of  wrinkles which covered his yellow face.    \"Evening, John,\" said Fletcher--and, pulling me with him, he made for  the head of the steps.    As I came abreast of the packing-case, the Chinaman lifted the lamp  and directed its light fully upon my face.    Great as was the faith which I reposed in my make-up, a doubt and a  tremor disturbed me now, as I found myself thus scrutinized by those  cunning old eyes looking out from the mask-like, apish face. For the  first time the Chinaman spoke.    \"You blinger fliend, Charlie?\" he squeaked in a thin, piping voice.    \"Him play piecee card,\" replied Fletcher briefly. \"Good fellow, plenty  much money.\"    He descended the steps, still holding my arm, and I perforce followed  him. Apparently John's scrutiny and Fletcher's explanation respecting  me, together had proved satisfactory; for the lamp was replaced upon  the lid of the packing-case, and the little bent figure dropped down  again into the shadows from which it had emerged.    \"Allee lightee,\" I heard faintly as I stumbled downward in the wake  of Fletcher.    I had expected to find myself in a cellar, but instead discovered that  we were in a small square court with the mist of the night about us  again. On a doorstep facing us stood a duplicate of the lamp upon the  box upstairs. Evidently this was designed to indicate the portals of  the Joy-Shop, for Fletcher pushed open the door, whose threshold  accommodated the lamp, and the light of the place beyond shone out  into our faces. We entered and my companion closed the door behind us.    Before me I perceived a long low room lighted by flaming gas-burners,  the jets hissing and spluttering in the draught from the door, for  they were entirely innocent of shades or mantles. Wooden tables,  their surfaces stained with the marks of countless wet glasses, were  ranged about the place, cafe fashion; and many of these tables  accommodated groups, of nondescript nationality for the most part.  One or two there were in a distant corner who were unmistakably  Chinamen; but my slight acquaintance with the races of the East did  not enable me to classify the greater number of those whom I now saw  about me. There were several unattractive-looking women present.    Fletcher walked up the center of the place, exchanging nods of  recognition with two hang-dog poker-players, and I was pleased to note  that our advent had apparently failed to attract the slightest  attention. Through an opening on the right-hand side of the room, near  the top, I looked into a smaller apartment, occupied exclusively by  Chinese. They were playing some kind of roulette and another game  which seemed wholly to absorb their interest. I ventured no more than  a glance, then passed on with my companion.    \"_Fan-tan!_\" he whispered in my ear.    Other forms of gambling were in progress at some of the tables; and  now Fletcher silently drew my attention to yet a third dimly lighted  apartment--this opening out from the left-hand corner of the  principal room. The atmosphere of the latter was sufficiently  abominable; indeed, the stench was appalling; but a wave of choking  vapor met me as I paused for a moment at the threshold of this inner  sanctuary. I formed but the vaguest impression of its interior; the  smell was sufficient. This annex was evidently reserved for  opium-smokers.    Fletcher sat down at a small table near by, and I took a common wooden  chair which he thrust forward with his foot. I was looking around at  the sordid scene, filled with a bitter sense of my own impotency to  aid my missing friend, when that occurred which set my heart beating  wildly at once with hope and excitement. Fletcher must have seen  something of this in my attitude, for--    \"Don't forget what I told you,\" he whispered. \"Be cautious!--be very  cautious!...\"        CHAPTER VIII    ZARMI OF THE JOY-SHOP      Down the center of the room came a girl carrying the only ornamental  object which thus far I  had seen in the Joy-Shop; a large Oriental  brass tray. She was a figure which must have formed a center of  interest in any place, trebly so, then, in such a place as this. Her  costume consisted in a series of incongruities, whilst the entire  effect was barbaric and by no means unpicturesque. She wore high-heeled  red slippers, and, as her short gauzy skirt rendered amply evident,  black silk stockings. A brilliantly colored Oriental scarf was wound  around her waist and knotted in front, its tasseled ends swinging  girdle fashion. A sort of chemise--like the _'anteree_ of Egyptian  women--completed her costume, if I except a number of barbaric  ornaments, some of them of silver, with which her hands and arms  were bedecked.    But strange as was the girl's attire, it was to her face that my gaze  was drawn irresistibly. Evidently, like most of those around us, she  was some kind of half-caste; but, unlike them, she was wickedly  handsome. I use the adverb _wickedly_ with deliberation; for the  pallidly dusky, oval face, with the full red lips, between which rested  a large yellow cigarette, and the half-closed almond-shaped eyes,  possessed a beauty which might have appealed to an artist of one of  the modern perverted schools, but which filled me less with admiration  than horror. For I _knew_ her--I recognized her, from a past, brief  meeting; I knew her, beyond all possibility of doubt, to be one of  the Si-Fan group!    This strange creature, tossing back her jet-black, frizzy hair, which  was entirely innocent of any binding or ornament, advanced along the  room towards us, making unhesitatingly for our table, and carrying her  lithe body with the grace of a _Ghazeeyeh_.    I glanced at Fletcher across the table.    \"Zarmi!\" he whispered.    Again I raised my eyes to the face which now was close to mine, and  became aware that I was trembling with excitement....    Heavens! why did enlightenment come too late! Either I was the victim  of an odd delusion, or Zarmi had been the driver of the cab in which  Nayland Smith had left the New Louvre Hotel!    Zarmi place the brass tray upon the table and bent down, resting her  elbows upon it, her hands upturned and her chin nestling in her palms.  The smoke from the cigarette, now held in her fingers, mingled with  her disheveled hair. She looked fully into my face, a long, searching  look; then her lips parted in the slow, voluptuous smile of the  Orient. Without moving her head she turned the wonderful eyes (rendered  doubly luminous by the _kohl_ with which her lashes and lids were  darkened) upon Fletcher.    \"What you and your strong friend drinking?\" she said softly.    Her voice possessed a faint husky note which betrayed her Eastern  parentage, yet it had in it the siren lure which is the ancient  heritage "]]]
