They are not due to the continued  cooeperation and control of the divine mind, nor to the original purpose  of God in the constitution of the universe. This is the doctrine of the  Materialists, and to this doctrine, we are sorry to say, Mr. Darwin,  although himself a theist, has given in his adhesion. It is on this  account the Materialists almost deify him.    From what has been said, it appears that Darwinism includes three  distinct elements. First, evolution; or the assumption that all organic  forms, vegetable and animal, have been evolved or developed from one, or  a few, primordial living germs; second, that this evolution has been  effected by natural selection, or the survival of the fittest; and  third, and by far the most important and only distinctive element of his  theory, that this natural selection is without design, being conducted  by unintelligent physical causes. Neither the first nor the second of  these elements constitute Darwinism; nor do the two combined. As to the  first, namely, evolution, Mr. Darwin himself, in the historical sketch  prefixed to the fifth edition of his \"Origin of Species,\" says, that  Lamarck, in 1811 and more fully in 1815, \"taught that all species,  including man, are descended from other species.\" He refers to some six  or eight other scientists, as teaching the same doctrine. This idea of  Evolution was prominently presented and elaborated in the \"Vestiges of  Creation,\" first published in 1844. Ulrici, Professor in the University  of Halle, Germany, in his work \"Gott und die Natur,\" says that the  doctrine of evolution took no hold on the minds of scientific men, but  was positively rejected by the most eminent physiologists, among whom he  mentions J. Mueller, K. Wagner, Bischoff, Hoffmann, and others.[8] The  Rev. George Henslow, Lecturer on Botany at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,  London, himself a pronounced evolutionist, says the theories of Lamarck  and of the \"Vestiges of Creation\" have given place to that of Mr.  Darwin; \"and there are not wanting many symptoms of decay in the  acceptance even of his. Not only has he considerably modified his views  in later editions of the 'Origin of Species,' distinctly expressing the  opinion that he attributed too great influence to natural selection, but  even men of science, Owen, Huxley,--and at least in its application to  man, Wallace himself,--are either opposed to it in great measure, or  else give it but a qualified assent. Thus, it has been the fate of all  theories of the development of living things to lapse into oblivion.  _Evolution_ itself, however, will stand the same.\"[9] We find in the  \"Transactions of the Victoria Institute,\" a still more decided  repudiation of Darwinism on the part of Mr. Henslow. He there says: \"I  do not believe in Darwin's theory; and have endeavored to refute it by  showing its utter impossibility.\"[10] He defines Evolution by saying,  \"It supposes all animals and plants that exist now, or have ever  existed, to have been produced through laws of generation from  preexisting animals and plants respectively; that affinity amongst  organic beings implies, or is due to community of descent; and that the  degree of affinity between organisms is in proportion to their nearness  of generation, or, at least, to the persistence of common characters,  they being the products of originally the same parentage.\"[11] A man,  therefore, may be an evolutionist, without being a Darwinian. It should  be mentioned that Mr. Henslow expressly excludes man, both as to body  and soul, from the law of evolution.    Nor is the theory of natural selection the vital principle of Mr.  Darwin's theory, unless the word natural be taken in a sense  antithetical to supernatural. In the historical sketch just referred to,  Mr. Darwin not only says that he had been anticipated in teaching the  doctrine of Evolution by Lamarck and the author of the \"Vestiges of  Creation;\" but that the theory of natural selection, as the means of  accounting for evolution, was not original with him. He tells us that as  early as 1813, Dr. W. C. Wells \"distinctly recognizes the principle of  natural selection;\" and that Mr. Patrick Matthew, in 1831, \"gives  precisely the same view of the origin of species as that propounded by  Mr. Wallace and myself.\" Ideas are like seed: they are often cast forth,  and not finding a congenial soil produce no fruit. To Mr. Darwin is  undoubtedly due the elaboration and thoroughly scientific defence of the  theory of natural selection, and to him is to be referred the deep and  widespread interest which it has excited.

[11] _Evolution and Religion_, p. 29.      _Darwinism excludes Teleology._    It is however neither evolution nor natural selection, which give  Darwinism its peculiar character and importance. It is that Darwin  rejects all teleology, or the doctrine of final causes. He denies design  in any of the organisms in the vegetable or animal world. He teaches  that the eye was formed without any purpose of producing an organ of  vision.    Although evidence on this point has already been adduced, yet as it is  often overlooked, at least in this country, so that many men speak  favorably of Mr. Darwin's theory, who are no more Darwinians than they  are Mussulmans; and as it is this feature of his system which brings it  into conflict not only with Christianity, but with the fundamental  principles of natural religion, it should be clearly established. The  sources of proof on this point are,--1st. Mr. Darwin's own writings. 2d.  The expositions of his theory given by its advocates. 3d. The character  of the objections urged by its opponents.    The point to be proved is that it is the distinctive doctrine of Mr.  Darwin, that species owe their origin, not to the original intention of  the divine mind; not to special acts of creation calling new forms into  existence at certain epochs; not to the constant and everywhere  operative efficiency of God, guiding physical causes in the production  of intended effects; but to the gradual accumulation of unintended  variations of structure and instinct, securing some advantage to their  subjects.      _Darwin's own Testimony._    That such is Mr. Darwin's doctrine we prove from his own writings. And  the first proof from that source is found in express declarations. When  an idea pervades a book and constitutes its character, detached passages  constitute a very small part of the evidence of its being inculcated. In  the present case, however, such passages are sufficient to satisfy even  those who have not had occasion to read Mr. Darwin's books. In referring  to the similarity of structure in animals of the same class, he says,  \"Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity  of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or the doctrine of  final causes.\"[12]    On the last page of his work, he says: \"It is interesting to  contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with  birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and  with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these  elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and  dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced  by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being  growth with reproduction; variability from the indirect and direct  action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a ratio of  increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life, and as a consequence  to natural selection, entailing divergence of character and extinction  of less improved forms. Thus from the war of nature, from famine and  death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, the  production of the higher animals directly follows. There is a grandeur  in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally  breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that whilst  this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity,  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most  wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\" (p. 579)    In another of his works, he asks, \"Did He (God) ordain that crop and  tail-feathers of the pigeon should vary, in order that the fancier might  make his grotesque pouter and fan-tail breeds? Did He cause the frame  and mental qualities of the dog to vary, in order that a breed might be  formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the bull,  for man's brutal sport? But if we give up the principle in one case; if  we do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog were  intentionally guided in order, for instance, that the greyhound, that  perfect image of symmetry and vigor, might be formed; no shadow of  reason can be assigned for the belief that variations, alike in nature  and the results of the same general laws, which have been the groundwork  through natural selection of the most perfectly adapted animals in the  world, man included, were intentionally and specially guided. However  much we may wish it, we can hardly follow Professor Asa Gray, in his  belief 'that variations have been led along certain beneficial lines, as  a stream is led along useful lines of irrigation.'\"[13]    Variations, which by their gradual accumulation give rise to new  species, genera, families, and orders,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],[0,"The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#7)"],[1," words of the man who had spoken.       Nobody contradicted him and he announced:         \"'Representative of the tribe of Isaachar, it is your turn!'         \"Now an old, trembling voice spoke:         \"'Let our brethren strive for the abolition of armed force. The       coarse military art is not for the sons of Israel. Not everyone can       be a Gideon! The army is for the defense of the throne and the       school of narrow patriotism. Not the sword, but reason and money       must rule. Therefore at every opportune instance, it is necessary       to help the downfall of the military class, to arouse suspicion in       the masses against it, and to incite animosity against one another.       It is enough for the soldiers to do police duty and to protect the       wealthy from those who have nothing.'         \"'The Lion of Judah has spoken,' said the stranger angrily. 'David       conquered Goliath. The nations will soon wear long coats instead of       military armour. A slap on the bourse will be equivalent to a lost       battle.'         \"It looked as though a storm was rising against this arrogant       sarcasm, but one word from the eldest restored them all to calm.         \"'This is the son of Baal! He may say whatever he pleases. But he       will do whatever is decided by the council of the tribes.'         \"'The tribe of Zebulun may speak!'         \"A dull voice, like a storm in the distance, said as follows:         \"'Our nation is conservative to its very root, and clings fast to       what is old. But our interest demands that we participate, or,       rather, direct the movements of nations. It is indisputable that       ours is a time of many reforms, whose main purpose is the       amelioration of the material condition of the needy classes. But       for this the propertied classes must sacrifice their capitals.       Capital is in the hands of the Jews. Therefore they must outwardly       take part in the movement and try to divert it from social and       political reforms. The masses themselves are blind and foolish, and       permit the shouters to rule over them. Who shouts more loudly and       more shrewdly than the Jews? Therefore our nation has been the       first on the platform, in the press, and in all Christian       communities! The more communities and meetings, the more       dissatisfaction and idleness. From this it follows inevitably that       the people grow poorer, that they become subjected to those who       have money, leading to the enrichment of the latter. Besides, every       movement makes us richer, for the smaller people are ruined and are       contracting debts. The unstability of the foundation increases our       power and our influence. Therefore the support of every kind of       dissatisfaction, every revolution, increases our capital and brings       us nearer to our goal.'         \"This terrible speech was followed by prolonged silence. Every       member of this secret Sanhedrim seemed to be thinking of its       terrible meaning. The son of Baal again laughed hoarsely.         \"'Are you afraid of blood? It isn't yours.'         \"Then one member of the gathering expressed his approval, and all       others followed his example.         \"'Son of the tribe of Dan, your turn!'         \"The answer bore the stamp of a Jew of the lower order:         \"'Every business in which there is speculation and profit must be       in our hands. That is our natural right. First of all, we must get       control of the traffic in liquor, butter, wool, and bread. Then we       shall have in our hands agriculture, farming. We can prepare bread       everywhere, and if dissatisfaction and want should arise, we can       easily throw the blame on the government. Petty wares, which give a       great deal of trouble and yield very little profit, we can leave in       the hands of the Christians. Let them work hard and suffer as the       chosen people suffered for several centuries.'         \"This speech scarcely needed approval. The Levite called on the       next one.         \"'Tribe of Naphtali?'         \"The following words rang out shrilly and with assurance:         \"'All governmental positions should be open to us. Once this       principle is established, the cunning and flattery of the Jewish       employees will help them to penetrate even there, and they will       have real influence. I am speaking only of the posts which bring       honor, power, and pre-eminence. Positions which require work and       knowledge may remain for the Christians. Therefore the Jews may       neglect positions of secondary importance. Justice is very       important for us, the law is a great step forward. This occupation       is suited to the cunning and skill of our people and gives us       influence and power against our natural enemies. Why can't a Jew be       Minister of Education as he has already been more than once       Minister of Finance?'         \"'Remember the scaffold of Haman, the fate of Shushan and Leopold!'       said a warning voice.         \"'Why does the raven croak about the past which is so distant and       almost forgotten? More than one of our people has been a Minister       in France and respected by the King himself.'         \"Approval was expressed in a tone of satisfied pride; then the       orator continued:         \"'Our people must be among the legislators of the governments. The       laws of the goyim against the children of Israel must be abolished.       We will maintain the laws of our Fathers. We need no longer any       laws that would protect us. No. We must concern ourselves about       laws that will give us privileges. A mild law respecting       bankruptcy, promulgated in the interests of humanity, would be a       golden mountain in our hands. First of all we must see to it that       the law regarding usury is abolished in all countries under the       pretext that money would thereby become cheaper. Money is just such       a commodity as others, and the law should give us the right to       regulate its price according to our desire.'         \"'Now is the turn for the tribe of Benjamin.'         \"'What can I add to the counsel of such wise men? The Jew should       also make use of honors, and should be at the head of all       organizations that may give him honor without risks, and he should       engage in science and the arts which are more adapted to the       character of our people and which we can master more easily. We can       become good actors and philosophers, because there is room for       speculation in these domains. In the arts our people will look       after the reception and will burn incense to ourselves. In science       we will take up medicine and philosophy. These afford opportunities       for theories and speculation. A physician penetrates the secrets of       families and holds their lives in his hands.'         \"'Tribe of Asher, your turn!'         \"'We must demand free marriage between Jews and Christians. Israel       will only be the gainer, even though there be an admixture of       impure blood to a certain degree. Our sons and daughters will marry       into renowned and powerful Christian families. We give money and       thus have influence. The Christian relationship cannot have a bad       influence on us, while we can exert a strong influence over them.       That is one thing. Another thing is that we respect the Jewish       woman and we enjoy the forbidden pleasure with the women of our       enemies. We have money, and for money we can get everything. A Jew       must never make a daughter of his own race his mistress. If he       should desire to sin against the Seventh Commandment he should       content himself with Christian girls.'         \"'What is the use of employing the beautiful girls of the goyim in       our stores if not for this?' angrily interposed the representative       of the evil spirit. 'Whoever will not want to satisfy our desire       will get no work, consequently no bread. Go to the large cities and       you will see that they are not waiting for your wise men's orders.       Substitute a contract for sacrament in the marriage of Christians       and their wives and daughters will come to you still more readily.'         \"The terrible cynicism of these words, touching such a delicate       subject, must have produced a profound impression, especially since       the views of the ancient doctrines were so strict on the topic of       moral purity.         \"'What does the law say?' asked one of the twelve.         \"'For adultery with a woman of our own people--death; for seducing a       girl--a fine, if she was not betrothed; if she was betrothed--death.       But the law is not so rigorous with regard to one who lives with a       slave--her body belongs to her master.'         \"'Are the goyim better than our slaves?'         \"This explanation was followed by a whisper of approval.         \"'The tribe of Manasseh may speak now!'         \"The last of the orators lifted his hand and during his speech he       raised and lowered it, as if desiring thus to make a stronger       impression by his words.

Our people must direct the daily publications. We are       cunning, shrewd, and we possess money which we know how to utilize       for our purposes. We need great political newspapers which mold       public opinion--criticism, the literature of the streets and the       stage.
