They  were, however, beaten back after a sharp skirmish, and compelled to seek  shelter again within their city's walls. William hesitated to make a  direct attack upon the city, but hoped by setting fire to Southwark to  strike terror into the inhabitants and bring them to a voluntary  surrender. He failed in his object; the city still held out, and William  next resorted to diplomacy.    (M53)    The ruling spirit within the city at that time was Ansgar or Esegar the  \"Staller\" under whom, as Sheriff of Middlesex, the citizens had marched  out to fight around the royal standard at Hastings. He had been carried  wounded from the field, and was now borne hither and thither on a litter,  encouraging the citizens to make a stout defence of their city. To him, it  is said, William sent a private message from Berkhampstead, asking only  that the Conqueror's right to the crown of England might be acknowledged  and nothing more, the real power of the kingdom might remain with Ansgar  if he so willed. Determined not to be outwitted by the Norman, Ansgar (so  the story goes) summoned a meeting of the eldermen (_natu majores_) of the  City--the forerunners of the later aldermen--and proposed a feigned  submission which might stave off immediate danger. The proposal was  accepted and a messenger despatched. William pretended to accept the terms  offered, and at the same time so worked upon the messenger with fair  promises and gifts that on his return he converted his fellow citizens and  induced them by representations of the Conqueror's friendly intentions and  of the hopelessness of resistance, to make their submission to him, and to  throw over the young Atheling.    (M54)    Whatever poetic tinge there may be about the story as told by Guy of  Amiens, it is certain that the citizens came to the same resolution, in  effect, as that described by the poet, nor could they well have done  otherwise. The whole of the country for miles around London, had already  tendered submission or been forced into it. The city had become completely  isolated, and sooner or later its inhabitants must have been starved out.  There was, moreover, a strong foreign element within its walls.(79) Norman  followers of Edward the Confessor were ever at hand to counsel submission.  London submitted, the citizens accepting the rule of the Norman Conqueror  as they had formerly accepted that of Cnut the Dane, \"from necessity.\" An  embassy was despatched to Berkhampstead, comprising the Archbishop of  York, the young Atheling, the earls Edwine and Morkere, and \"all the best  men of London,\" to render homage and give hostages,(80) and thus it was,  that within three months of his landing, William was acknowledged as the  lawfully elected King of England, and, as such, he crowned himself at  Westminster, promising to govern the nation as well as any king before him  if they would be faithful to him.    (M55)    The conciliatory spirit of William towards the Londoners is seen in the  favourable terms he was ready to concede them. Soon after his coronation--  the precise date cannot be determined--he granted them a charter,(81) by  which he clearly declared his purpose not to reduce the citizens to a  state of dependent vassalage, but to establish them in all the rights and  privileges they had hitherto enjoyed.    The charter, rendered into modern English, runs as follows:--    \"William, King, greets William, Bishop, and Gosfregdh, Portreeve, and all  the burgesses within London, French and English, friendly. And I give you  to know that I will that ye be all those laws worthy that ye were in King  Eadward's day.(82) And I will that every child be his father's heir after  his father's day and I will not suffer that any man offer you any wrong.  God keep you.\"    The terms of the charter are worthy of study. They are primarily  remarkable as indicating that the City of London was, at the time, subject  to a government which combined the secular authority of the port-reeve  with the ecclesiastical authority of the bishop. It was said, indeed, to  have been greatly due to the latter's intercession that the charter was  granted at all, and, in this belief, the mayor and aldermen were long  accustomed to pay a solemn visit to the bishop's tomb in St. Paul's  church, there to hear a _De profundis_ on the day when the new mayor took  his oath of office before the Barons of the Exchequer.(83)    (M56)    As regards the port-reeve--the _port-gerefa_, _i.e._, reeve of the port or  town of London(84)--the nature and extent of his duties and authority, much  uncertainty exists. Whilst, in many respects, his position in a borough  was analogous no doubt to the shire-reeve or sheriff of a county, there  were, on the other hand, duties belonging to and exercised by the one  which were not exercised by the other. Thus, for instance, the port-reeve,  unlike the sheriff, exercised no judicial functions in a criminal court,  nor presided over court-leets in the city as the sheriff did in his county  by _turn_, the latter being held independently by the alderman of each  ward.(85)    (M57) (M58) (M59)    In the next place the charter brings prominently to our notice the fact  that there was already existing within the City's walls a strong Norman  element, existing side by side with the older English burgesses, which the  Conqueror did well not to ignore. The descendants of the foreign merchants  from France and Normandy, for whose protection Ethelred had legislated  more than half a century before, had continued to carry on their  commercial intercourse with the Londoners, and were looking forward to a  freer interchange of merchandise now that the two countries were under one  sovereign. Their expectation was justified. No sooner had London submitted  to the Norman Conqueror than, we are told, \"many of the citizens of Rouen  and Caen passed over thither, preferring to be dwellers in that city,  inasmuch as it was fitter for their trading, and better stored with the  merchandise in which they were wont to traffic.\"(86) But by far the most  important clause in the charter is that which places the citizens of  London in the same position respecting the law of the land as they enjoyed  in the days of their late king, Edward the Confessor. Here there is  distinct evidence that the Conqueror had come \"neither to destroy, nor to  found, but to continue.\"(87) The charter granted nothing new; it only  ratified and set the royal seal(88) to the rights and privileges of the  citizens already in existence.    (M60)    It is recorded that William granted another charter to the citizens of  London, vesting in them the City and Sheriffwick of London, and this  charter the citizens proffered as evidence of their rights over the  cloister and church of St. Martin le Grand, when those rights were  challenged in the reign of Henry VI.(89) This charter has since been lost.    (M61)    The compact thus made between London and the Conqueror was faithfully kept  by both parties. Having ascended the English throne by the aid of the  citizens of London, William, unlike many of his successors, was careful  not to infringe the terms of their charter, whilst the citizens on the  other hand continued loyal to their accepted king, and lent him assistance  to put down insurgents in other parts of the kingdom. The fortress which  William erected within their city's walls did not disturb their  equanimity. It was sufficient for them that, under the Conqueror's rule,  the country was once more peaceful, so peaceful that, according to the  chronicler, a young maiden could travel the length of England without  being injured or robbed.(90)    (M62)    The close of the reign of William the First witnessed the completion of  \"Doomsday,\" or survey of the kingdom, which he had ordered to be made for  fiscal purposes. For some reason not explained, neither London nor  Winchester--the two capitals, so to speak, of the kingdom--were included in  this survey. It may be that the importance of these boroughs, their wealth  and population, necessitated some special method of procedure; but this  does not account for the omission of Northumberland, Cumberland,  Westmorland, and Durham, from the survey. We know that Winchester was  afterwards surveyed, but no steps in the same direction were ever taken  with respect to London. The survey was not effected without disturbances,  owing to the inquisitorial power vested in the commissioners appointed to  carry it out.    (M63)    William died whilst on a visit to his duchy of Normandy, and \"he who was  before a powerful king, and lord of many a land, had then of all his land,  only a portion of seven feet.\"(91) the same which, to this day, holds his  mortal remains in the Abbey at Caen. He was succeeded by William his son.  The death of the father and accession of his son was marked by fire,  pestilence, and famine.(92)    (M64)    A fire destroyed St. Paul's and the greater part of the City. Maurice,  Bishop of London, at once set to work to rebuild the Cathedral on a larger  and more magnificent scale, erecting the edifice upon arches in a manner  little known in England at that time, but long practised in France. The  Norman Conquest was already working for good. Not only the style of  architecture, but the very stone used in re-building St. Paul's came from  France, the famous quarries of Caen being utilised for the purpose.(93)    There was already in the city, one church built after the same manner, and  on that account called St. Mary of Arches or \"le Bow.\"  The object of  setting churches and other buildings upon vaults was to guard against  fire. Whatever defence against fire this method of building may have  afforded, it was certainly no defence against wind. In 1091, the roof of  St. Mary-le-Bow was clean blown off, huge baulks of timber, 26 feet long,  being driven into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19807"],[0,"Sketch of Grammar of the Chippeway Languages (#7)"],[1,"    Peendig, n. inside    Paquahkoostegowng, block-headed    Pequahquod, n. a ball or knot    Poodahwain, make fire    Poodahjegun, n. a musical or blowing instrument    Pookedaemin, n. a mandrake    Pahmetahgun, n. a servant    Pahbegwah, adj. rough    Pahquahskezhegun, n. a scythe    Papahmebahegood, n. a rider, a name for a dragoon    Pamahdezid, the living    Pahsquagin, n. leather    Pahbahgewahyaun, n. a shirt, calico    Pengwahshahgid, adj. naked    Pezindun, v. to hear, to listen    Pinggweh, n. ashes    Pungee, adj. little, not enough    Peendegaye-ee, prep. within    Pegiwh, n. gum, wax    Pemeday, n. oil, grease    Pequok, n. an arrow    Pooch, v. must    Pahkahahquay, n. a cock,--this bird has derived its name from its      crowing; so nearly all birds    Pahpahsay, n. a wood-pecker; this, from its pecking    Penaih, n. a partridge    Pahkaunnahkayah, adv. another way    Q.

Also, in his book _Life and journals of  Kah-ke-wa-quo-na-by_, in the journal entry for the 19th, it says,  \"Arrived at York in the afternoon, and commenced getting a small Indian  spelling book, which I had written, printed at Mr. McKenzie's office.\"  and considering \"Spelling\" was only 12 printed pages--3 sheets of  paper--that, I think, does qualify as \"a small Indian spelling  book.\"    _Syncope:_    Several words are presented in a partial syncope form. For example,  _gagiinawishkiwin_ to mean a fib, a lie or a falsehood, in the partial  syncope form is _ggiinawishkiwin_, and the full syncope form is  _ggiinwishkwin_. Summerfield presents this word as _Kenahweskewin,  n. falsehood_, which seems to match the partial syncope form of the  word. However, if this partial syncope is noted, so should the dozen  or so other words shown in partial syncope.           *       *       *       *       *             *       *       *       *    Errors and Anomalies    _Spelling Book_:      [Title page]    Ah-ne-she-nah-pay,  [-nah-pa]    Kah-ke-ke-noo-ah-mah-ween-twah  [Ka-ke-ke-]      [Words of one Syllable]    Squahch  [Squach]    shwahs  [shwas]      [Words of two syllables accented on the 1st & 2nd]    kah che  [ka che]      [Words of three syllables accented on the last]    ko se non [koo se non]      Words of four syllables accented on the sixth.
