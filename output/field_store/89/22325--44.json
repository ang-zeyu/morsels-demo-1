F. (100 deg. C.). Let us see what may  result chemically from the attainment of such high temperatures of water  in our steam boilers working under high pressures. If you blow ordinary  steam at 212 deg. F. or 100 deg. C., into fats or oils, the fats and oils remain  undecomposed; but suppose you let fatty and oily matters of animal or  vegetable origin, such as lubricants, get into your boiler feed-water  and so into your boiler, what will happen? I have only to tell you that  a process is patented for decomposing fats with superheated steam, to  drive or distil over the admixed fatty acids and glycerin, in order to  show you that in your boilers such greasy matters will be more or less  decomposed. Fats are neutral as fats, and will not injure the iron of  the boilers; but once decompose them and they are split up into an acid  called a fat acid, and glycerin. That fat acid at the high temperature  soon attacks your boilers and pipes, and eats away the iron. That is one  of the curious results that may follow at such high temperatures.  Mineral or hydrocarbon oils do not contain these fat acids, and so  cannot possibly, even with high-pressure steam, corrode the boiler  metal.    _Effect of Dissolved Salts on the Boiling of Water._--Let us inquire  what this effect is? Suppose we dissolve a quantity of a salt in water,  and then blow steam at 100 deg. C. (212 deg. F.) into that water, the latter  will boil not at 212 deg. F., but at a higher temperature. There is a  certain industrial process I know of, in course of which it is necessary  first to maintain a vessel containing water, by means of a heated closed  steam coil, at 212 deg. F. (100 deg. C.), and at a certain stage to raise the  temperature to about 327 deg. F. (164 deg. C.). The pressure on the boiler  connected with the steam coil is raised to nearly seven atmospheres, and  thus the heat of the high-pressure steam rises to 327 deg. F. (164 deg. C.), and  then a considerable quantity of nitrate of ammonium, a crystallised  salt, is thrown into the water, in which it dissolves. Strange to say,  although the water alone would boil at 212 deg. F., a strong solution in  water of the ammonium nitrate only boils at 327 deg. F., so that the effect  of dissolving that salt in the water is the same as if the pressure were  raised to seven atmospheres. Now let us, as hat manufacturers, learn a  practical lesson from this fact. We have observed that wool and fur  fibres are injured by boiling in pure water, and the heat has much to do  with this damage; but if the boiling take place in bichrome liquors or  similar solutions, that boiling will, according to the strength of the  solution in dissolved matters, take place at a temperature more or less  elevated above the boiling-point of water, and so the damage done will  be the more serious the more concentrated the liquors are, quite  independently of the nature of the substances dissolved in those  liquors.    _Solution._--We have already seen that when a salt of any kind dissolves  in water, heat is absorbed, and becomes latent; in other words, cold is  produced. I will describe a remarkable example or experiment, well  illustrating this fact. If you take some Glauber's salt, crystallised  sulphate of soda, and mix it with some hydrochloric acid (or spirits of  salt), then so rapidly will the solution proceed, and consequently so  great will be the demand for heat, that if a vessel containing water be  put in amongst the dissolving salt, the heat residing in that vessel and  its water will be rapidly extracted, and the water will freeze. As  regards solubility, some salts and substances are much more quickly and  easily dissolved than others. We are generally accustomed to think that  to dissolve a substance quickly we cannot do better than build a fire  under the containing vessel, and heat the liquid. This is often the  correct method of proceeding, but not always. Thus it would mean simply  loss of fuel, and so waste of heat, to do this in dissolving ordinary  table salt or rock salt in water, for salt is as soluble in cold water  as in hot. Some salts are, incredible though it may appear, less soluble  in boiling water than in cold. Water just above the freezing-point  dissolves nearly twice as much lime as it does when boiling. You see,  then, that a knowledge of certain important facts like these may be so  used as to considerably mitigate your coal bills, under given  circumstances and conditions.          LECTURE IV    WATER: ITS CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES; IMPURITIES AND THEIR ACTION; TESTS  OF PURITY--_Continued_      In the last lecture, under the head of \"Solution,\" I mentioned that some  salts, some chemical substances, are more soluble in water than others,  and that their solubilities under different circumstances of temperature  vary in different ways. However, some salts and compounds are  practically insoluble in water under any circumstances. We now arrive at  the important result known to chemists as the precipitation of insoluble  compounds from solutions. In order to define this result, however, we  must, of course, first consider the circumstances of causation of the  result. Let us take a simple case of chemical decomposition resulting in  the deposition or precipitation of a substance from solution in the  insoluble state. We will take a salt you are probably acquainted  with--sulphate of copper, or bluestone, and dissolve it in water, and we  have then the sulphate of copper in solution in water. Now suppose it is  our desire to obtain from that solution all the copper by depositing it  in some insoluble form. We may accomplish this in several different  ways, relying on certain methods of decomposing that sulphate of copper.  One of the simplest and most economical is that adopted in a certain  so-called wet method of extracting copper. It is based on the fact that  metallic iron has a greater tendency to combine in water solutions, with  the acids of copper salts, than the copper has in those salts. We  simply need to place some scraps of iron in the copper sulphate solution  to induce a change which may be represented as follows: Copper sulphate,  consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid, yields  with iron, iron sulphate, a combination of iron oxide with sulphuric  acid, and metallic copper. The metallic copper produced separates in the  form of a red coating on the iron scraps. But we may also, relying on  the fact that oxide of copper is insoluble in water, arrange for the  deposition of the copper in that form. This we can do by adding caustic  soda to a hot solution of copper sulphate, when we get the following  change: Copper sulphate, consisting of a combination of copper oxide  with sulphuric acid, yields with caustic soda, sulphate of soda, a  combination of soda with sulphuric acid and oxide of copper. Oxide of  copper is black, and so in this decomposition what is called a \"black  precipitate\" of that oxide is produced on adding the caustic soda. But  it might not suit us thus to deposit the copper from our solution; we  might desire to remove the sulphuric acid from the copper sulphate, and  leave the copper dissolved, say in the form of a chloride. We select,  then, a compound which is a chloride, and a chloride of a metal which  forms an insoluble combination with sulphuric acid--chloride of barium,  say. On adding this chloride of barium to sulphate of copper solution,  we get then a change which we might represent thus: Copper sulphate,  consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid, yields  with barium chloride, which is a combination of barium and chlorine,  insoluble barium sulphate, a combination of barium oxide with sulphuric  acid, and soluble copper chloride, a combination of copper and chlorine.  This is called a double interchange. Now these are a few illustrations  to show you what is meant by chemical decompositions. One practical  lesson, of course, we may draw is this: We must have a care in  dissolving bluestone or copper sulphate, not to attempt it in iron pans,  and not to store or put verdigris into iron vessels, or the iron will  be acted upon, and to some extent the copper salt will become  contaminated with iron. It will now be clear to you that, as a solvent  for bodies usually soluble in water, water that is perfectly pure will  be most suitable and not likely to cause any deposition or precipitation  through chemical decompositions, for there are no salts or other  compounds in pure water to cause such changes. Such pure water is called  soft water. But the term is only a comparative one, and water that is  not quite, but nearly pure--pure enough for most practical purposes--is  also called soft water. Now rain is the purest form of natural water,  for it is a kind of distilled water. Water rises in vapour from the  ocean as from a still, and the salt and other dissolved matters remain  behind. Meeting cold currents of air, the vapours condense in rain, and  fall upon the earth. After coming in contact with the earth, the  subsequent condition of that water entirely depends upon the character,  as regards solubility or insolubility, of the substances composing the  strata or layers of earth upon which it falls, and through which it  sinks. If it meets with insoluble rocks--for all rocks are not  insoluble--it remains, of course, pure and soft, and in proportion as  the constituents of rock and soil are soluble, in that proportion does  the water become hard. We all know how dangerous acid is in water,  causing that water to act on many substances, the iron of iron vessels,  the lime in soil or rock, etc., bringing iron and lime respectively into  solution. Now the atmosphere contains carbonic acid, and carbonic acid  occurs in the earth, being evolved by decomposing vegetation, etc.  Carbonic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#7)"],[1,"with buffaloes not stampeding,  but practically at rest. It is quite possible also that the extent of  the ground may have been underestimated.]    If the advancing multitude had been at all points 50 miles in length (as  it was known to have been in some places at least) by 25 miles in width,  and still averaged fifteen head to the acre of ground, it would have  contained the enormous number of 12,000,000 head. But, judging from the  general principles governing such migrations, it is almost certain that  the moving mass advanced in the shape of a wedge, which would make it  necessary to deduct about two-third from the grand total, which would  leave 4,000,000 as our estimate of the actual number of buffaloes in  this great herd, which I believe is more likely to be below the truth  than above it.    No wonder that the men of the West of those days, both white and red,  thought it would be impossible to exterminate such a mighty multitude.  The Indians of some tribes believed that the buffaloes issued from the  earth continually, and that the supply was necessarily inexhaustible.  And yet, in four short years the southern herd was almost totally  annihilated.    With such a lesson before our eyes, confirmed in every detail by living  testimony, who will dare to say that there will be an elk, moose,  caribou, mountain sheep, mountain goat, antelope, or black-tail deer  left alive in the United States in a wild state fifty years from this  date, ay, or even twenty-five?    Mr. William Blackmore contributes the following testimony to the  abundance of buffalo in Kansas:[24]    [Note 24: Plains of the Great West, p. xvi.]    \"In the autumn of 1868, whilst crossing the plains on the Kansas Pacific  Railroad, for a distance of upwards of 120 miles, between Ellsworth and  Sheridan, we passed through an almost unbroken herd of buffalo. The  plains were blackened with them, and more than once the train had to  stop to allow unusually large herds to pass. * * * In 1872, whilst on a  scout for about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge to the Indian  Territory, we were never out of sight of buffalo.\"    Twenty years hence, when not even a bone or a buffalo-chip remains above  ground throughout the West to mark the presence of the buffalo, it may  be difficult for people to believe that these animals ever existed in  such numbers as to constitute not only a serious annoyance, but very  often a dangerous menace to wagon travel across the plains, and also to  stop railway trains, and even throw them off the track. The like has  probably never occurred before in any country, and most assuredly never  will again, if the present rate of large game destruction all over the  world can be taken as a foreshadowing of the future. In this connection  the following additional testimony from Colonel Dodge (\"Plains of the  Great West,\" p. 121) is of interest:    \"The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad was then [in 1871-'72] in  process of construction, and nowhere could the peculiarity of the  buffalo of which I am speaking be better studied than from its trains.  If a herd was on the north side of the track, it would stand stupidly  gazing, and without a symptom of alarm, although the locomotive passed  within a hundred yards. If on the south side of the track, even though  at a distance of 1 or 2 miles from it, the passage of a train set the  whole herd in the wildest commotion. At full speed, and utterly  regardless of the consequences, it would make for the track on its line  of retreat. If the train happened not to be in its path, it crossed the  track and stopped satisfied. If the train was in its way, each  individual buffalo went at it with the desperation of despair, plunging  against or between locomotive and cars, just as its blind madness  chanced to direct it. Numbers were killed, but numbers still pressed on,  to stop and stare as soon as the obstacle had passed. After having  trains thrown off the track twice in one week, conductors learned to  have a very decided respect for the idiosyncrasies of the buffalo, and  when there was a possibility of striking a herd 'on the rampage' for the  north side of the track, the train was slowed up and sometimes stopped  entirely.\"    The accompanying illustration, reproduced from the \"Plains of the Great  West,\" by the kind permission of the author, is, in one sense, ocular  proof that collisions between railway trains and vast herds of buffaloes  were so numerous that they formed a proper subject for illustration. In  regard to the stoppage of trains and derailment of locomotives by  buffaloes, Colonel Dodge makes the following allusion in the private  letter already referred to: \"There are at least a hundred reliable  railroad men now employed on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad  who were witnesses of, and sometimes sufferers from, the wild rushes of  buffalo as described on page 121 of my book. I was at the time stationed  at Fort Dodge, and I was personally cognizant of several of these  'accidents.'\"    [Illustration: SLAUGHTER OF BUFFALO ON THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD.  Reproduced from \"The Plains of the Great West,\" by permission of the  author, Col. R. I. Dodge.]    The following, from the ever pleasing pen of Mr. Catlin, is of decided  interest in this connection:    \"In one instance, near the mouth of White River, we met the most immense  herd crossing the Missouri River [in Dakota], and from an imprudence got  our boat into imminent danger amongst them, from which we were highly  delighted to make our escape. It was in the midst of the 'running  season,' and we had heard the 'roaring' (as it is called) of the herd  when we were several miles from them. When we came in sight, we were  actually terrified at the immense numbers that were streaming down the  green hills on one side of the river, and galloping up and over the  bluffs on the other. The river was filled, and in parts blackened with  their heads and horns, as they were swimming about, following up their  objects, and making desperate battle whilst they were swimming. I deemed  it imprudent for our canoe to be dodging amongst them, and ran it ashore  for a few hours, where we laid, waiting for the opportunity of seeing  the river clear, but we waited in vain. Their numbers, however, got  somewhat diminished at last, and we pushed off, and successfully made  our way amongst them. From the immense numbers that had passed the river  at that place, they had torn down the prairie bank of 15 feet in height,  so as to form a sort of road or landing place, where they all in  succession clambered up. Many in their turmoil had been wafted below  this landing, and unable to regain it against the swiftness of the  current, had fastened themselves along in crowds, hugging close to the  high bank under which they were standing. As we were drifting by these,  and supposing ourselves out of danger, I drew up my rifle and shot one  of them in the head, which tumbled into the water, and brought with him  a hundred others, which plunged in, and in a moment were swimming about  our canoe, and placing it in great danger. No attack was made upon us,  and in the confusion the poor beasts knew not, perhaps, the enemy that  was amongst them; but we were liable to be sunk by them, as they were  furiously hooking and climbing on to each other. I rose in my canoe, and  by my gestures and hallooing kept them from coming in contact with us  until we were out of their reach.\"[25]    [Note 25: Catlin's North American Indians, II, p. 13.]          IV. CHARACTER OF THE SPECIES.      1. _The buffaloes rank amongst ruminants._--With the American people,  and through them all others, familiarity with the buffalo has bred  contempt. The incredible numbers in which the animals of this species  formerly existed made their slaughter an easy matter, so much so that  the hunters and frontiersmen who accomplished their destruction have  handed down to us a contemptuous opinion of the size, character, and  general presence of our bison. And how could it be otherwise than that a  man who could find it in his heart to murder a majestic bull bison for a  hide worth only a dollar should form a one-dollar estimate of the  grandest ruminant that ever trod the earth? Men who butcher African  elephants for the sake of their ivory also entertain a similar estimate  of their victims.    With an acquaintance which includes fine living examples of all the  larger ruminants of the world except the musk-ox and the European bison,  I am sure that the American bison is the grandest of them all. His only  rivals for the kingship are the Indian bison, or gaur (_Bos gaurus_), of  Southern India, and the aurochs, or European bison, both of which  really surpass him in height, if not in actual balk also. The aurochs is  taller, and possesses a larger pelvis and heavier, stronger  hindquarters, but his body is decidedly smaller in all its proportions,  which gives him a lean and \"leggy\" look. The hair on the head, neck, and  forequarters of the aurochs is not nearly so long or luxuriant as on the  same parts of the American bison. This covering greatly magnifies the  actual bulk of the latter animal. Clothe the aurochs with the wonderful  pelage of our buffalo, give him the same enormous chest and body, and  the result would be a magnificent bovine monster, who would indeed stand  without a rival. But when first-class types of the two species are  placed side by side it seems to me that _Bison americanus_ will easily  rank his European rival.    The gaur has no long hair upon any part of his body or head. What little  hair he has is very short and thin, his hindquarters being almost naked.  I have seen hundreds of these animals at short range, and have killed  and skinned several very fine specimens, one of which stood 5 feet 10  inches in height at the shoulders. But, despite his larger bulk, his  appearance is not nearly so striking and impressive as"]]]
