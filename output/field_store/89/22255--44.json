For they aspire to the highest, and this, in their  sleep-walking, they dream is highest. Wake them and they shall quit  the false good and leap to the true, and leave governments to clerks  and desks. This revolution is to be wrought by the gradual  domestication of the idea of Culture. The main enterprise of the world  for splendor, for extent, is the upbuilding of a man. Here are the  materials strewn along the ground. The private life of one man shall  be a more illustrious monarchy, more formidable to its enemy, more  sweet and serene in its influence to its friend, than any kingdom in  history. For a man, rightly viewed, comprehendeth[75] the particular  natures of all men. Each philosopher, each bard, each actor has only  done for me, as by a delegate, what one day I can do for myself. The  books which once we valued more than the apple of the eye, we have  quite exhausted. What is that but saying that we have come up with the  point of view which the universal mind took through the eyes of one  scribe; we have been that man, and have passed on. First, one, then  another, we drain all cisterns, and waxing greater by all these  supplies, we crave a better and a more abundant food. The man has  never lived that can feed us ever. The human mind cannot be enshrined  in a person who shall set a barrier on any one side to this unbounded,  unboundable empire. It is one central fire, which, flaming now out of  the lips of Etna, lightens the capes of Sicily, and now out of the  throat of Vesuvius, illuminates the towers and vineyards of Naples. It  is one light which beams out of a thousand stars. It is one soul which  animates all men.           *       *       *       *       *    But I have dwelt perhaps tediously upon this abstraction of the  Scholar. I ought not to delay longer to add what I have to say of  nearer reference to the time and to this country.    Historically, there is thought to be a difference in the ideas which  predominate over successive epochs, and there are data for marking the  genius of the Classic, of the Romantic, and now of the Reflective or  Philosophical age.[76] With the views I have intimated of the oneness  or the identity of the mind through all individuals, I do not much  dwell on these differences. In fact, I believe each individual passes  through all three. The boy is a Greek; the youth, romantic; the  adult, reflective. I deny not, however, that a revolution in the  leading idea may be distinctly enough traced.    Our age is bewailed as the age of Introversion.[77] Must that needs be  evil? We, it seems, are critical. We are embarrassed with second  thoughts.[78] We cannot enjoy anything for hankering to know whereof  the pleasure consists. We are lined with eyes. We see with our feet.  The time is infected with Hamlet's unhappiness,--         \"Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.\"[79]    Is it so bad then? Sight is the last thing to be pitied. Would we be  blind? Do we fear lest we should outsee nature and God, and drink  truth dry? I look upon the discontent of the literary class as a mere  announcement of the fact that they find themselves not in the state of  mind of their fathers, and regret the coming state as untried; as a  boy dreads the water before he has learned that he can swim. If there  is any period one would desire to be born in, is it not the age of  Revolution; when the old and the new stand side by side and admit of  being compared; when the energies of all men are searched by fear and  by hope; when the historic glories of the old can be compensated by  the rich possibilities of the new era? This time, like all times, is a  very good one, if we but know what to do with it.    I read with some joy of the auspicious signs of the coming days, as  they glimmer already through poetry and art, through philosophy and  science, through church and state.    One of these signs is the fact that the same movement[80] which  effected the elevation of what was called the lowest class in the  state assumed in literature a very marked and as benign an aspect.  Instead of the sublime and beautiful, the near, the low, the common,  was explored and poetized. That which had been negligently trodden  under foot by those who were harnessing and provisioning themselves  for long journeys into far countries, is suddenly found to be richer  than all foreign parts. The literature of the poor, the feelings of  the child, the philosophy of the street, the meaning of household  life, are the topics of the time. It is a great stride. It is a  sign--is it not?--of new vigor when the extremities are made active,  when currents of warm life run into the hands and the feet. I ask not  for the great, the remote, the romantic; what is doing in Italy or  Arabia; what is Greek art, or Provencal minstrelsy; I embrace the  common, I explore and sit at the feet of the familiar, the low. Give  me insight into to-day, and you may have the antique and future  worlds. What would we really know the meaning of? The meal in the  firkin; the milk in the pan; the ballad in the street; the news of the  boat; the glance of the eye; the form and the gait of the body;--show  me the ultimate reason of these matters; show me the sublime presence  of the highest spiritual cause lurking, as always it does lurk, in  these suburbs and extremities of nature; let me see every trifle  bristling with the polarity that ranges it instantly on an eternal  law;[81] and the shop, the plow, and the ledger referred to the like  cause by which light undulates and poets sing;--and the world lies no  longer a dull miscellany and lumber-room, but has form and order:  there is no trifle, there is no puzzle, but one design unites and  animates the farthest pinnacle and the lowest trench.    This idea has inspired the genius of Goldsmith,[82] Burns,[83]  Cowper,[84] and, in a newer time, of Goethe,[85] Wordsworth,[86] and  Carlyle.[87] This idea they have differently followed and with various  success. In contrast with their writing, the style of Pope,[88] of  Johnson,[89] of Gibbon,[90] looks cold and pedantic. This writing is  blood-warm. Man is surprised to find that things near are not less  beautiful and wondrous than things remote. The near explains the far.  The drop is a small ocean. A man is related to all nature. This  perception of the worth of the vulgar is fruitful in discoveries.  Goethe, in this very thing the most modern of the moderns, has shown  us, as none ever did, the genius of the ancients.    There is one man of genius who has done much for this philosophy of  life, whose literary value has never yet been rightly estimated:--I  mean Emanuel Swedenborg.[91] The most imaginative of men, yet writing  with the precision of a mathematician, he endeavored to engraft a  purely philosophical Ethics on the popular Christianity of his time.  Such an attempt of course must have difficulty which no genius could  surmount. But he saw and showed the connexion between nature and the  affections of the soul. He pierced the emblematic or spiritual  character of the visible, audible, tangible world. Especially did his  shade-loving muse hover over and interpret the lower parts of nature;  he showed the mysterious bond that allies moral evil to the foul  material forms, and has given in epical parables a theory of insanity,  of beasts, of unclean and fearful things.    Another sign of our times, also marked by an analogous political  movement, is the new importance given to the single person. Everything  that tends to insulate the individual--to surround him with barriers  of natural respect, so that each man shall feel the world is his, and  man shall treat with man as a sovereign state with a sovereign  state--tends to true union as well as greatness. \"I learned,\" said the  melancholy Pestalozzi,[92] \"that no man in God's wide earth is either  willing or able to help any other man.\" Help must come from the bosom  alone. The scholar is that man who must take up into himself all the  ability of the time, all the contributions of the past, all the hopes  of the future. He must be an university of knowledges. If there be one  lesson more than another that should pierce his ear, it is--The world  is nothing, the man is all; in yourself is the law of all nature, and  you know not yet how a globule of sap ascends; in yourself slumbers  the whole of Reason; it is for you to know all; it is for you to dare  all. Mr. President and Gentlemen, this confidence in the unsearched  might of man belongs, by all motives, by all prophecy, by all  preparation, to the American Scholar. We have listened too long to the  courtly muses of Europe. The spirit of the American freeman is already  suspected to be timid, imitative, tame. Public and private avarice  make the air we breathe thick and fat. The scholar is decent,  indolent, complaisant. See already the tragic consequence. The mind of  this country, taught to aim at low objects, eats upon itself. There is  no work for any one but the decorous and the complaisant. Young men of  the fairest promise, who begin life upon our shores, inflated by the  mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of God, find the earth  below not in unison with these, but are hindered from action by the  disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire, and  turn drudges, or die of disgust, some of them suicides. What is the  remedy? They did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful  now crowding to the barriers for the career do not yet see, that if  the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there  abide, the huge world will come round to him. Patience,--patience;  with the shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace  the perspective of your own infinite life; and for work the study and  the communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent,  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#7)"],[1,"them we recognize at once undoubted congeners of our  Mediterranean race in Europe. The area of their extension runs off  into Africa, through the Egyptians, who are clearly of the same race.  Not only the modern peoples, but the Ancient Egyptians and the  Phoenicians also have been traced to the same source. By far the  largest portion of this part of Western Asia is inhabited by this  eastern branch of the Mediterranean race.\" The broad-headed type  \"occurs sporadically among a few ethnic remnants in Syria and  Mesopotamia\".[16] The exhaustive study of thousands of ancient crania  in London and Cambridge collections has shown that Mediterranean  peoples, having alien traits, the result of early admixture, were  distributed between Egypt and the Punjab.[17] Where blending took  place, the early type, apparently, continued to predominate; and it  appears to be reasserting itself in our own time in Western Asia, as  elsewhere. It seems doubtful, therefore, that the ancient Sumerians  differed racially from the pre-Dynastic inhabitants of Egypt and the  Pelasgians and Iberians of Europe. Indeed, the statuettes from Tello,  the site of the Sumerian city of Lagash, display distinctively  Mediterranean skull forms and faces. Some of the plump figures of the  later period suggest, however, \"the particular alien strain\" which in  Egypt and elsewhere \"is always associated with a tendency to the  development of fat\", in contrast to \"the lean and sinewy appearance of  most representatives of the Brown race\".[18] This change may be  accounted for by the presence of the Semites in northern Babylonia.    Whence, then, came these invading Semitic Akkadians of Jewish type? It  is generally agreed that they were closely associated with one of the  early outpourings of nomadic peoples from Arabia, a country which is  favourable for the production of a larger population than it is able  to maintain permanently, especially when its natural resources are  restricted by a succession of abnormally dry years. In tracing the  Akkadians from Arabia, however, we are confronted at the outset with  the difficulty that its prehistoric, and many of its present-day,  inhabitants are not of the characteristic Semitic type. On the Ancient  Egyptian pottery and monuments the Arabs are depicted as men who  closely resembled the representatives of the Mediterranean race in the  Nile valley and elsewhere. They shaved neither scalps nor faces as did  the historic Sumerians and Egyptians, but grew the slight moustache  and chin-tuft beard like the Libyans on the north and the majority of  the men whose bodies have been preserved in pre-Dynastic graves in the  Nile valley. \"If\", writes Professor Elliot Smith, \"the generally  accepted view is true, that Arabia was the original home of the  Semites, the Arab must have undergone a profound change in his  physical characters after he left his homeland and before he reached  Babylonia.\" This authority is of opinion that the Arabians first  migrated into Palestine and northern Syria, where they mingled with  the southward-migrating Armenoid peoples from Asia Minor. \"This blend  of Arabs, kinsmen of the proto-Egyptians and Armenoids, would then  form the big-nosed, long-bearded Semites, so familiar not only on the  ancient Babylonian and Egyptian monuments, but also in the modern  Jews.\"[19] Such a view is in accord with Dr. Hugo Winckler's  contention that the flow of Arabian migrations was northwards towards  Syria ere it swept through Mesopotamia. It can scarcely be supposed  that these invasions of settled districts did not result in the fusion  and crossment of racial types and the production of a sub-variety with  medium skull form and marked facial characteristics.    Of special interest in this connection is the evidence afforded by  Palestine and Egypt. The former country has ever been subject to  periodic ethnic disturbances and changes. Its racial history has a  remote beginning in the Pleistocene Age. Palaeolithic flints of  Chellean and other primitive types have been found in large numbers,  and a valuable collection of these is being preserved in a French  museum at Jerusalem. In a northern cave fragments of rude pottery,  belonging to an early period in the Late Stone Age, have been  discovered in association with the bones of the woolly rhinoceros. To  a later period belong the series of Gezer cave dwellings, which,  according to Professor Macalister, the well-known Palestinian  authority, \"were occupied by a non-Semitic people of low stature, with  thick skulls and showing evidence of the great muscular strength that  is essential to savage life\".[20] These people are generally supposed  to be representatives of the Mediterranean race, which Sergi has found  to have been widely distributed throughout Syria and a part of Asia  Minor.[21] An interesting problem, however, is raised by the fact  that, in one of the caves, there are evidences that the dead were  cremated. This was not a Mediterranean custom, nor does it appear to  have prevailed outside the Gezer area. If, however, it does not  indicate that the kinsmen of the Ancient Egyptians came into contact  with the remnants of an earlier people, it may be that the dead of a  later people were burned there. The possibility that unidentified  types may have contributed to the Semitic blend, however, remains. The  Mediterraneans mingled in Northern Syria and Asia Minor with the  broad-headed Armenoid peoples who are represented in Europe by the  Alpine race. With them they ultimately formed the great Hittite  confederacy. These Armenoids were moving southwards at the very dawn  of Egyptian history, and nothing is known of their conquests and  settlements. Their pioneers, who were probably traders, appear to have  begun to enter the Delta region before the close of the Late Stone  Age.[22] The earliest outpourings of migrating Arabians may have been  in progress about the same time. This early southward drift of  Armenoids might account for the presence in southern Palestine, early  in the Copper Age, of the tall race referred to in the Bible as the  Rephaim or Anakim, \"whose power was broken only by the Hebrew  invaders\".[23] Joshua drove them out of Hebron,[24] in the  neighbourhood of which Abraham had purchased a burial cave from  Ephron, the Hittite.[25] Apparently a system of land laws prevailed in  Palestine at this early period. It is of special interest for us to  note that in Abraham's day and afterwards, the landed proprietors in  the country of the Rephaim were identified with the aliens from Asia  Minor--the tall variety in the Hittite confederacy.    Little doubt need remain that the Arabians during their sojourn in  Palestine and Syria met with distinctive types, and if not with pure  Armenoids, at any rate with peoples having Armenoid traits. The  consequent multiplication of tribes, and the gradual pressure  exercised by the constant stream of immigrants from Arabia and Asia  Minor, must have kept this part of Western Asia in a constant state of  unrest. Fresh migrations of the surplus stock were evidently propelled  towards Egypt in one direction, and the valleys of the Tigris and  Euphrates in another. The Semites of Akkad were probably the  conquerors of the more highly civilized Sumerians, who must have  previously occupied that area. It is possible that they owed their  success to the possession of superior weapons. Professor Elliot Smith  suggests in this connection that the Arabians had become familiar with  the use of copper as a result of contact with the Egyptians in Sinai.  There is no evidence, however, that the Sumerians were attacked before  they had begun to make metal weapons. It is more probable that the  invading nomads had superior military organization and considerable  experience in waging war against detached tribal units. They may have  also found some of the northern Sumerian city states at war with one  another and taken advantage of their unpreparedness to resist a common  enemy. The rough Dorians who overran Greece and the fierce Goths who  shattered the power of Rome were similarly in a lower state of  civilization than the peoples whom they subdued.    The Sumerians, however, ultimately achieved an intellectual conquest  of their conquerors. Although the leaders of invasion may have formed  military aristocracies in the cities which they occupied, it was  necessary for the great majority of the nomads to engage their  activities in new directions after settlement. The Semitic Akkadians,  therefore, adopted Sumerian habits of life which were best suited for  the needs of the country, and they consequently came under the spell  of Sumerian modes of thought. This is shown by the fact that the  native speech of ancient Sumer continued long after the dawn of  history to be the language of Babylonian religion and culture, like  Latin in Europe during the Middle Ages. For centuries the mingling  peoples must have been bilingual, as are many of the inhabitants of  Ireland, Wales, and the Scottish Highlands in the present age, but  ultimately the language of the Semites became the prevailing speech in  Sumer and Akkad. This change was the direct result of the conquests  and the political supremacy achieved by the northern people. A  considerable period elapsed, however, ere this consummation was  reached and Ancient Babylonia became completely Semitized. No doubt  its brilliant historical civilization owed much of its vigour and  stability to the organizing genius of the Semites, but the basis on  which it was established had been laid by the ingenious and  imaginative Sumerians who first made the desert to blossom like the  rose.    The culture of Sumer was a product of the Late Stone Age, which should  not be regarded as necessarily an age of barbarism. During its vast  periods there were great discoveries and great inventions in various  parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The Neoliths made pottery "]]]
