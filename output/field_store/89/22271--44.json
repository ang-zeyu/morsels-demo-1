Not that he was the man to  refuse, for he jumped at the offer, and, as he would be of age before the  season came round, and would have got all his money out of Chancery, he  disdained to talk about a subscription, and boldly took the hounds as his  own. He then became a very important personage at Laverick Wells.    He had always been a most important personage among the ladies, but as the  men couldn't marry him, those who didn't want to borrow money of him, of  course, ran him down. It used to be, 'Look at that dandified ass, Waffles,  I declare the sight of him makes me sick'; or, 'What a barber's apprentice  that fellow is, with his ringlets all smeared with Macassar.'    Now it was Waffles this, Waffles that, 'Who dines with Waffles?' 'Waffles  is the best fellow under the sun! By Jingo, I know no such man as Waffles!'  '_Most deserving_ young man!'    In arriving at this conclusion, their judgement was greatly assisted by the  magnificent way he went to work. Old Tom Towler, the whip, who had toiled  at his calling for twenty long years on fifty pounds and what he could  'pick up,' was advanced to a hundred and fifty, with a couple of men under  him. Instead of riding worn-out, tumble-down, twenty-pound screws, he was  mounted on hundred-guinea horses, for which the dealers were to have a  couple of hundred, _when they were paid_. Everything was in the same  proportion.    Mr. Waffles' succession to the hunt made a great commotion among the  fair--many elegant and interesting young ladies, who had been going on the  pious tack against the Reverend Solomon Winkeyes, the popular bachelor  preacher of St. Margaret's, teaching in his schools, distributing his  tracts, and collecting the penny subscriptions for his clothing club, now  took to riding in fan-tailed habits and feathered hats, and talking about  leaping and hunting, and riding over rails. Mr. Waffles had a pound of  hat-strings sent him in a week, and muffatees innumerable. Some, we are  sorry to say, worked him cigar-cases. He, in return, having expended a vast  of toil and ingenuity in inventing a 'button,' now had several dozen of  them worked up into brooches, which he scattered about with a liberal hand.  It was not one of your matter-of-fact story-telling buttons--a fox with  'TALLY-HO,' or a fox's head grinning in grim death--making a red  coat look like a miniature butcher's shamble, but it was one of your  queer-twisting lettered concerns, that may pass either for a military  button or a naval button, or a club button, or even for a livery button.  The letters, two W's, were so skilfully entwined, that even a  compositor--and compositors are people who can read almost anything--would  have been puzzled to decipher it. The letters were gilt, riveted on steel,  and the wearers of the button-brooches were very soon dubbed by the  non-recipients, 'Mr. Waffles' sheep.'    [Illustration]    A fine button naturally requires a fine coat to put it on, and many were  the consultations and propositions as to what it should be. Mr. Slocdolager  had done nothing in the decorative department, and many thought the failure  of funds was a good deal attributable to that fact. Mr. Waffles was not the  man to lose an opportunity of adding another costume to his wardrobe, and  after an infinity of trouble, and trials of almost all the colours of the  rainbow, he at length settled the following uniform, which, at least, had  the charm of novelty to recommend it. The morning, or hunt-coat, was to be  scarlet, with a cream-coloured collar and cuffs; and the evening, or dress  coat, was to be cream-colour, with a scarlet collar and cuffs, and scarlet  silk facings and linings, looking as if the wearer had turned the morning  one inside out. Waistcoats, and other articles of dress, were left to the  choice of the wearer, experience having proved that they are articles it is  impossible to legislate upon with any effect.    The old ladies, bless their disinterested hearts, alone looked on the hound  freak with other than feelings of approbation.    They thought it a pity he should take them. They wished he mightn't injure  himself--hounds were expensive things--led to habits of  irregularity--should be sorry to see such a nice young man as Mr. Waffles  led astray--not that it would make any difference to them, _but_--(looking  significantly at their daughters). No fox had been hunted by more hounds  than Waffles had been by the ladies; but though he had chatted and prattled  with fifty fair maids--any one of whom he might have found difficult to  resist, if 'pinned' single-handed by, in a country house, yet the  multiplicity of assailants completely neutralized each other, and verified  the truth of the adage that there is 'safety in a crowd.'    If pretty, lisping Miss Wordsworth thought she had shot an arrow home to  his heart over night, a fresh smile and dart from little Mary Ogleby's dark  eyes extracted it in the morning, and made him think of her till the  commanding figure and noble air of the Honourable Miss Letitia Amelia  Susannah Jemimah de Jenkins, in all the elegance of first-rate millinery  and dressmakership, drove her completely from his mind, to be in turn  displaced by some one more bewitching. Mr. Waffles was reputed to be made  of money, and he went at it as though he thought it utterly impossible to  get through it. He was greatly aided in his endeavours by the fact of its  being all in the funds--a great convenience to the spendthrift. It keeps  him constantly in cash, and enables him to 'cut and come again,' as quick  as ever he likes. Land is not half so accommodating; neither is money on  mortgage. What with time spent in investigating a title, or giving notice  to 'pay in,' an industrious man wants a second loan by the time, or perhaps  before, he gets the first. Acres are not easy of conversion, and the mere  fact of wanting to sell implies a deficiency somewhere. With money in the  funds, a man has nothing to do but lodge a power of attorney with his  broker, and write up for four or five thousand pounds, just as he would  write to his bootmaker for four or five pairs of boots, the only difference  being, that in all probability the money would be down before the boots.  Then, with money in the funds, a man keeps up his credit to the far  end--the last thousand telling no more tales than the first, and making  just as good a show.    We are almost afraid to say what Mr. Waffles' means were, but we really  believe, at the time he came of age, that he had 100,000_l._ in the funds,  which were nearly at 'par'--a term expressive of each hundred being worth a  hundred, and not eighty-nine or ninety pounds as is now the case, which  makes a considerable difference in the melting. Now a real _bona fide_  100,000_l._ always counts as three in common parlance, which latter sum  would yield a larger income than gilds the horizon of the most mercenary  mother's mind, say ten thousand a-year, which we believe is generally  allowed to be 'v--a--a--ry handsome.'    No wonder, then, that Mr. Waffles was such a hero. Another great  recommendation about him was, that he had not had time to be much plucked.  Many of the young men of fortune that appear upon town have lost half their  feathers on the race-course or the gaming-table before the ladies get a  chance at them; but here was a nice, fresh-coloured youth, with all his  downy verdure full upon him. It takes a vast of clothes, even at Oxford  prices, to come to a thousand pounds, and if we allow four or five thousand  for his other extravagances, he could not have done much harm to a hundred  thousand.    Our friend, soon finding that he was 'cock of the walk,' had no notion of  exchanging his greatness for the nothingness of London, and, save going up  occasionally to see about opening the flood-gates of his fortune, he spent  nearly the whole summer at Laverick Wells. A fine season it was, too--the  finest season the Wells had ever known. When at length the long London  season closed, there was a rush of rank and fashion to the English  watering-places, quite unparalleled in the 'recollection of the oldest  inhabitants.' There were blooming widows in every stage of grief and woe,  from the becoming cap to the fashionable corset and ball flounce--widows  who would never forget the dear deceased, or think of any other  man--_unless he had at least five thousand a year_. Lovely girls, who  didn't care a farthing if the man was 'only handsome'; and smiling mammas  'egging them on,' who would look very different when they came to the  horrid L s. d. And this mercantile expression leads us to the observation  that we know nothing so dissimilar as a trading town and a watering-place.  In the one, all is bustle, hurry, and activity; in the other, people don't  seem to know what to do to get through the day. The city and west-end  present somewhat of the contrast, but not to the extent of manufacturing or  sea-port towns and watering-places. Bathing-places are a shade better than  watering-places in the way of occupation, for people can sit staring at the  sea, counting the ships, or polishing their nails with a shell, whereas at  watering-places, they have generally little to do but stare at and talk of  each other, and mark the progress of the day, by alternately drinking at  the wells, eating at the hotels, and wandering between the library and the  railway station. The ladies get on better, for where there are ladies there  are always fine shops, and what between turning over the goods, and  sweeping the streets with their trains, making calls, and arranging  partners for balls, they get through their time very pleasantly; but what  is 'life' to them is often death to the men.        "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#7)"],[1,"by wealthy men and  tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of  tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of  which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when  extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over  settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston  manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a  representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New  York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European  estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they  ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial  power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances  extending to capital punishment.    The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence  as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge  estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by  slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten  that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large  section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of  America.    [Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]    =The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and  throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of  servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,  the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his  family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the  immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of  labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the  crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In  many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,  the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a  moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and  German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not  propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they  could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced  proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in  small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions  became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the  farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold  system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.    [Illustration: _From an old print_    A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]    =Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western  settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the  same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both  cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence  which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,  however, differed widely.    The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the  English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who  labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice  and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his  entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,  silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the  ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford  or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for  his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the  Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native  goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who  were usually gifted slaves.    The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His  crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English  factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed  local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,  weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him  with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought  by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not  buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and  between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community  was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great  plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,  more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New  West.    =The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in  one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of  an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as  a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration  set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over  mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap  lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path  breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third  generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the  mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following  their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back  stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular  settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes  singly and sometimes in companies.    In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of  Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the  eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west  until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New  York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,  and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,  particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early  filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New  Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In  Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of  advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,  spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying  out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the  Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank  where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties  a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching  the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn  family.    In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was  quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the  cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from  the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams  of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the  other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing  the main supply. \"By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing  and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully  occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.  Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of  home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies.\"    [Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]    Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an  invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As  early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt  buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the  Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the  plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers  followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the  Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier  times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit  rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution  there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older  colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked  the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the  Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our \"embryo  fourteenth colony.\"      INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT    Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was  a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the  staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their  beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to  towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their  numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard  originated in the days when the king of England was \"lord of these  dominions.\"    [Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]    =Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in  addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor  of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry  which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in  abundance in the North and South. \"Every farm house,\" says Coman, the  economic historian, \"was a workshop where the women spun and wove the  serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear.\"  By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth  in sufficient quantities to"]]]
