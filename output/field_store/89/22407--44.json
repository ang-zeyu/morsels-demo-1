In the Aqdas He thus  writes: 'We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of  maturity; this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your  forefathers. He has exempted from this those who are weak from illness or  age, as a bounty from His Presence, and He is the Forgiving, the  Generous.'    \"And in another passage He says: 'We have enjoined upon you fasting during  a brief period, and at its close have designated for you Naw-Ruz as a  Feast... The traveller, the ailing, those who are with child or giving  suck, are not bound by the Fast... Abstain from food and drink, from  sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that  is appointed in the Book.'    \"Also in the 'Questions and Answers' that form an appendix to the Aqdas,  Baha'u'llah reveals the following: 'Verily, I say that God has appointed a  Great station for fasting and prayer. But during good health its benefit  is evident, and when one is ill, it is not permissible to fulfill them.'  Concerning the age of maturity, He reveals in the appendix of that same  Book: 'The age of maturity is in the fifteenth year; women and men are  alike in this respect.' Regarding the vital character and importance of  the Divine ordinances and laws, and the necessity of complete obedience to  them by the believers, we thus read in the Gleanings, p. 175:    'Know verily that the essence of justice and the source thereof are both  embodied in the ordinance prescribed by Him Who is the Manifestation of  the Self of God amongst men, if ye be of them that recognize this truth.  He doth verily incarnate the highest, the infallible standard of justice  unto all creation. Were His law to be such as to strike terror in the  hearts of all that are in heaven and on earth, that law is naught but  manifest justice. The fears and agitation which the revelation of this law  provoke in men's hearts should indeed be likened to the cries of the  suckling babe weaned from his mother's milk, if ye be of them that  perceive...'    \"The fasting period, which lasts nineteen days starting as a rule from the  second of March every year and ending on the twentieth of the same month,  involves complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset.  It is essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual  recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the necessary  readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the  spiritual forces latent in his soul. Its significance and purpose are,  therefore, fundamentally spiritual in character. Fasting is symbolic, and  a reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires.\"            72: FAST (THE)      \"Regarding your question concerning the Fast: Travellers are exempt from  fasting, but if they want to fast while they are travelling, they are free  to do so. You are exempt the whole period of your travel, not just the  hours you are in a train or car, etc. If one eats unconsciously during the  fasting hours, this is not breaking the Fast as it is an accident. The age  limit is 70 years, but if one desires to fast after the age limit is  passed, and is strong enough to, one is free to do so. If during the Fast  period a person falls ill and is unable to fast, but recovers before the  Fast period is over, he can start to fast again and continue until the  end. Of course the Fast, as you know, can only be kept during the month  set aside for that purpose.\"            73: FEAST DAY (CHANGING OBSERVANCE OF)      \"This is really a matter of secondary importance, and should be decided by  the Assembly. Meetings which have been publicly advertised for a certain  date cannot obviously be cancelled.\"            74: FEAST (NATURE OF)      \"Concerning the nature of the Nineteen-Day Feast, in the Aqdas,  Baha'u'llah clearly revealed the spiritual and social character of this  Institution. Its administrative significance, however, has been stressed  by the Guardian in direct response to the growing needs of the Baha'i  Community in this formative period of the Baha'i era for better training  in the principles and practice of Baha'i administration.\"            75: NAW-RUZ FEAST (OBSERVANCE OF FEAST DAY CALENDAR)      \"The Naw-Ruz Feast should be held on March 21 before sunset and has  nothing to do with the 19-day Feast. The 19-day Feast is administrative in  function whereas the Naw-Ruz is our New Year, a Feast of hospitality and  rejoicing.\"            76: NAW-RUZ, TIME OF CELEBRATION OF      \"Regarding Naw-Ruz: If the vernal equinox falls on the 21st of March  before sunset, it is celebrated on that day. If at any time after sunset,  Naw-Ruz will then, as stated by Baha'u'llah, fall on the 22nd. As to which  spot should be regarded as the standard, this is a matter which the  Universal House of Justice will have to decided. The American NSA need not  therefore take any action in this matter at present.\"            77: FEAST (TIME FOR HOLDING)      \"Regarding the time for the holding of the Nineteen-Day Feasts and  elections; the Guardian would advise your Assembly to urge the friends to  hold such gatherings on the prescribed day before sunset. If impossible,  then it is permissible to hold them on the preceding day. In connection  with the nine holy days, however, the friends should consider it  obligatory to celebrate them on the prescribed day before sunset.\"            78: FEASTS (ATTENDANCE AT)      \"Attendance at 19-Day Feasts is not obligatory but very important, and  every believer should consider it a duty and a privilege to be present on  such occasions.\"    \"He wishes the Baha'is to press for recognition of their right to observe  their own Holy Days, and to observe them whenever possible in strict  accordance with our teachings.\"            79: FEASTS AND ANNIVERSARIES--BAHA'I      \"The Baha'i Day starts and ends at sunset, and consequently the date of  the celebration of Baha'i Feasts should be adjusted to conform to the  Baha'i Calendar Time...\"            80: FUND (HOW EVERY BELIEVER CAN TEST THE MEASURE OF HIS FAITH)      \"He wishes you particularly to impress the believers with the necessity of  maintaining the flow of their contributions to the Temple, and also to  stress the importance of the Institution of the National Baha'i Fund  which, in these early days of the administrative development of the Faith,  is the indispensable medium for the growth and expansion of the Movement.  Contributions to this fund constitute, in addition, a practical and  effective way whereby every believer can test the measure and character of  his Faith, and to prove in deeds the intensity of his devotion and  attachment to the Cause.\"            81: FUND (THE LIFE-BLOOD OF THESE NASCENT INSTITUTIONS)      \"As the activities of the American Baha'i Community expand, and its  world-wide prestige correspondingly increases, the Institution of the  National Fund, the bedrock on which all other Institutions must  necessarily rest and be established, acquires added importance, and should  be increasingly supported by the entire body of believers, both in their  individual capacities and through their collective efforts, whether  organized as groups or as Local Assemblies. The supply of funds, in  support of the National Treasury, constitutes, at the present time, the  life-blood of these nascent institutions you are laboring to erect. Its  importance cannot, surely, be overestimated. Untold blessings shall no  doubt crown every effort directed to that end.\"            82: FUND (NATIONAL FUND, CHIEF OBLIGATION OF)      \"Regarding his special contributions to the Teaching Fund; he feels that  this is a matter to be left entirely to the discretion of the N.S.A. He  feels that the continuous expenditure of a considerable sum to provide for  traveling expenses of teachers who are in need, constitutes in these days  the chief obligation of the National Fund. An effort should be made to  facilitate as much as possible, the extension of the teaching work by  helping those who are financially unable to reach their destination, and  once there to encourage them to settle and earn the means of their  livelihood.\"            83: FUND (WE MUST BE LIKE THE FOUNTAIN)      \"We must be like the fountain or spring that is continually emptying  itself of all that it has and is continually being refilled from an  invisible source. To be continually giving out for the good of our fellows  undeterred by fear of poverty and reliant on the unfailing bounty of the  Source of all wealth and all good--this is the secret of right living.\"            84: FUND (THE SACRED OBLIGATION)      \"And as the progress and extension of spiritual activities is dependent  and conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that  immediately after the establishment of Local as well as National Spiritual  Assemblies, a Baha'i Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive  control of the Spiritual Assembly. All donations and contributions should  be offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of  promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout the locality or country.  It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of  Baha'u'llah who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and  generously for the increase of that Fund...\"            85: FUNERAL (BAHA'I FUNERAL SERVICE)      \"Regarding the Baha'i funeral service: It is extremely simple, as it  consists only of a congregational prayer to be read before burial. This  prayer will be made available to the friends when the Aqdas is translated  and published. In the meantime your N.S.A. should take great care lest any  uniform procedure or ritual in this matter be adopted or imposed upon the  friends. The danger in this, as in some other cases regarding Baha'i  worship, is that a definite system of rigid rituals and practices be  developed among "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#7)"],[1,"us thereby to disregard what is extraneous and  unimportant. The answers to the question put forth, would, I feel, be  extremely valuable to the N.S.A. in India, and with the proper backing,  respect and support of the entire friends, they should not lose a minute  in an endeavour to remedy and inspire what ought not and what should be  done, in an effort to spread the Cause.    [From the Guardian:]    I trust that the forthcoming Convention will remedy most if not all the  present deficiencies in the Cause and lend an unprecedented impetus to the  progress of the Faith. The Teaching work should be stressed as it is the  Fountain-head from which all future blessings will flow. We must first and  foremost add to our small numbers, and introduce fresh blood into the  organic life of the community. I will specially supplicate this bounty for  the representative delegates to be assembled at Convention this year.    December 19, 1928          Maintain and Strengthen the Unity of the National Assembly      He was very glad to hear of the success of the Convention. He hopes that  such gatherings will become yearly and, like in other countries, lead to a  better understanding among the friends. It is surely true that as the  Cause progresses differences will more and more arise. So unless there be  a meeting place where the different views are thrashed, true unity of  purpose and activity will not be obtained.    Just as much as the result of the Convention made him happy he was sorry  to hear of the differences that exist between the N.S.A. members. The real  source of the difficulty is, I believe, the lack of constant intercourse  between the different members. As the country is so very vast meetings  cannot be very frequent and well attended, and this ultimately leads to  misunderstandings and lack of faith in each other. Shoghi Effendi knows  the different individuals involved, he knows their integrity and faith in  the Cause and its spirit. He is sure that they, each and all, have no  other purpose but to serve the progress of the movement and uphold its  interests. And they will surely not commit an act that would retard the  very Cause they are serving. What the solution is, I do not know. What  Shoghi Effendi has been hoping during the last two or three years is a  spirit of mutual trust that would overcome physical handicaps. But that  seems to be impossible. A lurking dissatisfaction is sure to appear at the  end.    [From the Guardian:]    Your subsequent letter dated Jan. 24 has also reached me. I will specially  remember our dear and valued co-worker Prof. Pritam Singh when I visit the  sacred Shrine that the spirit of Baha'u'llah may inspire, guide and  sustain him in his great task. Regarding your last convention and the  non-participation of the Burma delegates, I feel that the utmost effort  must be exerted during the coming elections in April to elect those who  are best fitted for this supreme and responsible position, and once  elected, resignation is not to be accepted. The members must meet and  consult in person. Persia is preparing for the holding of national  elections, and for India and Burma to revert to a system that is being  abandoned by the Persian believers would be a decidedly retrograde step.  We must at all costs maintain and strengthen the unity of the National  Assembly. Everything must be subordinated to this end. I will supplicate  our Beloved to enable you to achieve His purpose.    February 12, 1929    It is his sincere hope and desire to see the newly-elected National  Assembly during its term of office, infuse a new and fresh spirit into  every Baha'i activity both in India and Burma, and while establishing  perfect unity and harmony within its own ranks and the entire body of the  believers, should take vigorous steps to teach the Cause and to establish  a progressive and representative Baha'i community in both countries.    June 20, 1929    With regard to your proposal that the N.S.A. should meet once in Burma and  once in India, the Guardian wishes me to record his hearty approval and to  even suggest that if it should be feasible they should meet even more  often than that in both places.    It is his sincere hope that in this manner and through the individual  effort of every member the misunderstandings existing between India and  Burma will be wiped out altogether and that a fresh start will be made in  a spirit of true and whole-hearted accord.    July 8, 1929    He hopes that the new National Assembly will do its utmost to bring about  unity in its group and among the friends. For, as he has often stated, the  work of the Cause will remain cramped unless that unity is obtained. The  petty differences that do exist are the result of misunderstandings and  these can surely be eliminated.    August 20, 1929          \"Baha'i World\"--Foremost Baha'i Publication      I write on behalf of the Guardian to remind you that the next issue of the  'Baha'i World' will soon appear and its editors are already busy compiling  material.    He has been asked by the editors in America to request you please to make  a special effort to contribute as much material as you possibly can in the  form of photographs, reports, accounts, and individual articles; and to  send them as soon as possible to America in order that a work which the  Guardian considers our foremost Baha'i publication in the world, may be as  representative of the many countries and especially Eastern peoples as we  would all wish it to be.    December 15, 1929          \"Huquq\"      ...As regards \"Huquq\", it is really 19 per cent of one's income payable to  the Guardian. But it is not obligatory now.    December 19, 1929          Syed Jenab Ali--Distinguished Baha'i Leader      He was very sorry to learn of the illness of Syed Jenab Ali and since the  receipt of your letter, he has been extremely grieved to learn of his  passing. His sudden departure throws a shadow of gloom upon all of us here  and in India and while Burma loses a distinguished and truly earnest  Baha'i leader, it must be especially unfortunate to you that just at a  time when you were considering and preparing the ground for Government  Recognition and a temporary consideration of Baha'i laws, you were  deprived of his valued cooperation. The Cause in India is as yet in such a  tender age that we can ill afford the loss of those few that keep the  torch aflame.    [From the Guardian:]    The news of the passing of our dear and able friend and collaborator Syed  Jenab Ali has brought profound sorrow to our hearts. He leaves a great gap  behind him. I hope that the friends far from feeling disheartened and  discouraged at such a great loss will arise and redouble their efforts in  order to compensate for the loss which they have sustained. Kindly assure  his relatives of my deep grief, and my prayers for his departed soul.    January 6, 1930          Martha Root Visits India      ...Miss Root is at present in Tehran and she does not know just how long  she will stay, but surely before leaving for India she would inform you of  her plans in time.    It is such a pity that Mr. Vakil is unwell. He is a man we cannot spare  just as the passing of Syed Jenab Ali leaves a serious gap in Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    Miss Root will soon be with you, and I trust her visit may lend a fresh  impetus to your work of consolidation and spread of the Cause. I will  continue to pray for your efforts and activities from the depths of my  heart. Be not disheartened. Persevere in your labours and rest assured  that the Beloved will richly reward those who stand firm in the Faith, and  those who persevere in their endeavours.    March 1, 1930    Miss Root has been delayed by the enthusiastic reception she has received  in Persia and she is now planning to visit southern and eastern Persia  where she has not yet been. We hope her visit to India will prove of some  value in attracting the attention of the intelligent classes among the  non-Baha'is, but perhaps the political agitation will entirely defeat that  purpose at the present time.    April 26, 1930    He was very glad to hear of the activities of Miss Martha Root in India  and hopes that they will all bear some wonderful fruits for the progress  of the Cause in India. It is sure that with the existence of the present  political unrest in that country few are ready to pay any attention to  religious matters, but among the very intelligent people there are  undoubtedly people whose vision extends further than the present  difficulties and desire a spiritual rebirth for that much divided and  troubled nation. To these the Baha'i teachings should undoubtedly present  a much desired reform movement. Anyhow Shoghi Effendi hopes that with the  help of Miss Root you have been able to approach such eminent persons and  have sown in their heart the seed of faith.    July 4, 1930    Concerning the trip of Miss Martha Root, we have already heard about her  activities from many sources. Shoghi Effendi sincerely hopes that the  National Assembly will undertake such measures as would keep up the work  and produce some tangible result from her visit. It is very important to  follow up the work that she started and keep in touch with the people she  has been able to interest.    [From the Guardian:]    With the assurance of my deep appreciation of your many and highly  successful endeavours in connection with the visit of Miss Root and of my  fervent and loving prayers for your own happiness and spiritual  advancement.    September 19, 1930          Baha'i Representation at the All-Asian Women's Conference      Concerning Baha'i representation at the All-Asian Women's Conference; this  is undoubtedly a most commendable thing to do especially as the Cause has  so much concerning the position of women in society. Shoghi Effendi hopes  that the National Assembly will do its best to win the admiration of all  the assembled"]]]
