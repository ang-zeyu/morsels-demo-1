Some of another      sort are made of hair, raccoon, bever, or squirrel skins,      which are very warm. Others again are made of the greenpart      of the skin of a mallard's head, which they sew perfectly      well together, their thread being either the sinews of a deer      divided very small, or silk grass. When these are finished,      they look very finely, though they must needs be very      troublesome to make.[45]    Du Pratz thus describes the art in Louisiana:        If the women know how to do this kind of work they make      mantles either of feathers or woven of the bark of the      mulberry tree. We will describe their method of doing this.      The feather mantles are made on a frame similar to that on      which the peruke makers work hair; they spread the feathers      in the same manner and fasten them on old fish nets or old      mantles of mulberry bark. They are placed, spread in this      manner, one over the other and on both sides; for this      purpose small turkey feathers are used; women who have      feathers of swans or India ducks, which are white, make these      feather mantles for women of high rank.[46]    Butel-Dumont describes feather work of the natives of Louisiana briefly  as follows:        They [the women] also, without a spinning wheel or distaff,      spin the hair or wool of cattle of which they make garters      and ribands; and with the thread which they obtain from      lime-tree bark, they make a species of mantle, which they      cover with the finest swan's feathers fastened one by one to      the material. A long task indeed, but they do not count this      trouble and time when it concerns their satisfaction.[47]      EMBROIDERY.    The use of beads, quills, and other articles to beautify the surfaces  of fabrics and skins was as common, no doubt, with the ancient as with  the modern native inhabitants of the Mississippi valley. In discoursing  on the dress of native women of Louisiana Butel-Dumont says that  the young girls wear--        * * * a sort of network attached to the waist and terminating      in a point, * * * both sides of which are ornamented with      ribbons of thread made from lime-tree fiber, also made into      network. From the waist to the knees hang several cords of      the same thread, to the ends of which are attached claws of      birds of prey, such as eaglets, crows, etc., so that when the      girls walk these make a rattling noise which is highly      pleasing to them. This kind of ornament does not illy      resemble those nets which we use to cover our horses to      protect them from flies.[48]    From Du Pratz we have the following:        The women make also designs in embroidery with the skin of      the porcupine; they remove for this purpose the skin of this      animal, which is white and black; they split it very fine to      use as embroidery thread, dye a part of the white skin a red      color, another part yellow, and a third part is left white;      they usually work on black skin, and dye the black a reddish      brown; but if they work on bark, the black [threads] remain      the same. Their designs are very similar to some of those      found in Gothic architecture; they are composed of straight      lines which form right angles at their conjunction, which is      commonly called the corner of a square. They also work      similar designs on mantles and coverings which they make with      the bark of the mulberry tree.[49]    John Smith testifies to the same practices in Virginia as shown in the  following lines:        For their apparell, they are sometimes covered with the      skinnes of wilde beasts, which in Winter are dressed with the      hayre, but in Sommer without. The better sort use large      mantels of Deare skins, not much differing in fashion from      the Irish mantels. Some imbrodered with white beads, some      with Copper, other painted after their manner. * * * We haue      seene some use mantels made of Turky feathers, so prettily      wrought and woven with threads that nothing could be      discerned but the feathers.[50]       [26] Travels in North America, Peter Kalm.

FOSSIL FABRICS.      MODES OF PRESERVATION.    Contenting myself with the preceding references to the practice of the  arts of spinning and weaving in the various regions of the country,  I pass on to an examination of the archeologic material which includes  traces or remnants of the weaver's work from all sections of the  country. As already mentioned, there are a number of ways in which  textile articles or data relating to them may be preserved in such  manner as to permit examination and study.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. II MAT  OF. SPLIT CANE.]    Through charring by the use of fire in burial rites, and by contact with  copper or preservative salts in burial caves, numerous pieces of cloth  and parts of costumes have come into our possession. One of the most  fertile sources of information has but recently been made available. The  ancient potter employed woven fabrics in handling, finishing, and  decorating pottery. From mounds, graves, and dwelling sites, all over  the country, vases and sherds are found covered with impressions of  these fabrics, and so well preserved that by taking casts in clay or wax  entirely satisfactory restorations are made. Something may be learned  from the recovery of implements of spinning and weaving, but up to this  time the only relics secured are a few rather rude spindle whorls.    I shall present in the following paragraphs such portions of the available  data as seem calculated to illustrate briefly and clearly the nature  of the ancient art.      FABRICS FROM CAVES AND SHELTERS.    At an early date in the history of the country reports began to find  their way into print relating to the discovery of mortuary fabrics in  caverns and shelters. Extracts from some of these publications may  be given.    From the writing of John Haywood historian of Tennessee, we have the  following:        In the spring of the year 1811, was found in a copperas cave      in Warren county, in West Tennessee, about 15 miles southwest      from Sparta, and 20 from McMinnville, the bodies of two human      beings, which had been covered by the dirt or ore from which      copperas was made. One of these persons was a male, the other      a female. They were interred in baskets, made of cane,      curiously wrought, and evidencing great mechanic skill. They      were both dislocated at the hip joint, and were placed erect      in the baskets, with a covering made of cane to fit the      baskets in which they were placed. The flesh of these persons      was entire and undecayed, of a brown dryish colour, produced      by time, the flesh having adhered closely to the bones and      sinews. Around the female, next her body, was placed a well      dressed deer skin. Next to this was placed a rug, very      curiously wrought, of the bark of a tree and feathers. The      bark seemed to have been formed of small strands well      twisted. Around each of these strands, feathers were rolled,      and the whole woven into a cloth of firm texture, after the      manner of our common coarse fabrics. This rug was about three      feet wide, and between six and seven feet in length. The      whole of the ligaments thus framed of bark were completely      covered with feathers, forming a body of about one eighth of      an inch in thickness, the feathers extending about one      quarter of an inch in length from the strand to which they      were confined. The appearance was highly diversified by      green, blue, yellow and black, presenting different shades of      colour when reflected upon by the light in different      positions. The next covering was an undressed deer skin,      around which was rolled, in good order, a plain shroud      manufactured after the same order as the one ornamented with      feathers.

Besides, Frau Bucher  killed everything under these confounding and confounded  circumstances. She sat between him and her daughter and ruled the  conversation. It was little better than taking her alone, so he  abandoned also these enterprises.    In the talk at table the family, with Teuton tactlessness, now and  then cried out the surpassing merits of the German young man.  Unquestionably he led all others. Gard met no success in stemming  the tide, miffed as he was about this social seclusion of the  daughter. He soon saw his mistake in feeling personally hurt, as if  insulted. It was but the custom. Could it be indeed a fact that  German youths were such moral reprobates that girls could not be  trusted to their unguarded companionship? The question had no  meaning to his hosts. It was useless to hint of such an idea,  burning as he often was to launch it upon the waves of discussion.  To them, chaperoning signified the highest morals.    They exploded with, \"It may very well be as you say in America!  That is to be expected. Are there any morals in the United States?  We have heard awful things. There are the Mormons. There is  co-education. And young girls of the best families go around loose  with men day and night. What _could_ be the result? Free love. And  free love means cheap love or no love at all. Admittedly pretty low  conditions for virtue. What else can be looked for in a country  where all sorts of people come promiscuously from everywhere?  Divorces, voting females, slatterns, homelessness, neglected, poorly  educated children.\"    If, in passing, America and Americans were referred to in the  family, and this was rare, Elsa, Gard noticed, kept silent. Yet she  could be very wrought up about other Europeans. This nursed his  fancies. He interpreted it in terms of promise. Elsa, he decided,  was a good girl in a hedge-hog environment of unbelievable traits,  of warring contrasts.          CHAPTER VIII    GERMAN COURTSHIP      Once during the winter he tried on her a course of flirtation which  he had learned very well in his Sophomore year. But German girls do  not flirt. His arrows sank in feebly, impotently, as if her  attention had the despairing resistance of a sandbag. Unperturbed  she made nothing of it. He felt that she thought he was silly or had  the rickets. So he speedily gave this up.    Thus he became aware how vastly different are courtship and other  relations between young men and young women in America and in  Germany. He asked himself.    \"Are the German ways more civilized?\" Certainly, to the Teuton, they  represent a more creditable and becoming evolution. He always  stoutly favors his own customs, and finds little here to discuss.  Even if a rotten morality in his young gods is to be assumed, this  would be proper as in the young gods of the mythologies.    The Teuton marriage refers plainly to property. The language has  prominent terms indicating how espousal means goods with a woman  attached to them. There is scarcely an equivalent in English.  Courtship in the form of natural little raptures that disport in and  beautify enamored companionship in youth, the pure, unfettered,  mystic attraction between the sexes in blossoming time, are  practically unknown to the German social life. The full gloss of  fancy, the velveting of manners, the felicitous fabrication of  innocent emotions into a blessed garment of many colors, find their  development outside the domain of Thor. Such associations have there  no charming playtime, but forthwith make for permanent good or  permanent evil.    Accordingly, for Gard, in his fond inclinations, there was no  experience with Cupids about the Bucher flower garden. Only, as it  were, a sort of rough sledding on broken, jolting ice! And he noted  the comparative absence of such delicate sentiment in German  literature. Aside from Heine, who became French, German letters have  relatively little to offer on this score. The very language  discourages love-making. Since Heine's exile a century ago, the  increasing might of the armored Hohenzollerns had finally almost  killed all this.    Gard was thrown out of gear in another way. Fraeulein's lack not only  of amatory complaisance but of social polish or even facility kept  him dubious and disconcerted. She brusquely alternated between a  sisterly tenderness of familiarity, almost exaggerated, only to  follow it by a sudden, disquieting flop over on the side of a  formality as stiff as buckram. She would be as distant as if they  were two boarders having a tiff in a _pension_. These detachments  were not because of anything Kirtley had done or said. They formed  a natural example of Gothic undevelopedness in human relations, the  rude unevenness of beginners.    But, then, he forgave her for this.    \"Is she not extremely occupied--full of pursuits? How admirable!\"    It shamed him, spurred him on not a little. For days he would only  see her at the generous meals where she exclaimed over her dread of  getting fat. That usually furnishes a German with an excuse for  being helped to more. She dutifully played of an evening in the  family orchestra, yet this was a musical, not a social, happening.  The severe if rich harmonies that were favored, largely with the  idea of drill, created generally an atmosphere of austerity.    She could not understand Gard's offers to carry her umbrella over  her to a class or to bring her a storm coat in case of need. Such  attentiveness meant intrusions almost to be resented. She appeared  to frown upon any kindly little considerations that should have been  agreeable to her or at any rate convenient. She had been brought up  to do everything for herself. There was nothing of the clinging vine  about her. Young German women are not expected to lean upon men in  this wise.    Presents of candy or what-not are looked upon with an inquisitive or  doubtful eye, especially by the parents. For the German girl has no  charming secrets from her father and mother. They must know all,  with immediate conjectures about marriage. Troubling gifts,  consequently, became rather out of the question with Gard.    He feared that Fraeulein Elsa might reflect sometimes the feeling of  unfriendliness which he was aware of in the supercilious Rudi. The  latter exhibited a negligent attitude of indifference toward Gard,  though it was cloaked under casualness. There was a sinister air  about the young engineer, and she would be bound to follow  submissively anyone breathing the military ozone.    Under all these unsettling circumstances, Kirtley's uncertain  attachment for the German language did not increase by Peter  Schlemihl strides. Besides, his regular teacher was something like a  wild boar. He had proceeded to dragoon Gard as if he were a lad. And  Herr Keller's person was offensive. He exhaled a smell unpleasant if  scholastic. Dressed in a soiled, shiny, black garb, and with a  bristly mustache and beard which often showed egg of a morning, he  talked blatantly of having been in Paris as a soldier in '70. It was  his one excursion out of Saxony.    Even the German language at such a cost was not very inviting.  Finally Gard received a curt note to the effect that if he were not  more assiduous, the lessons would better end. Herr Keller did not  want to be bothered with triflers.    \"Bounced from school!\" Kirtley exclaimed. It was the first time. He  took advantage of this opportunity to discontinue.    He could see that his hosts did not blame the professor. Why, he was  capable of forcibly drilling the Teuton language and literature into  a post hole. This doubtless confirmed Kirtley's failure as a student  in their eyes. And this was to be looked for in Americans who think  that they can acquire knowledge and know life by gadding about and  \"observing,\" instead of by book study. The awful German language  seemed doomed to blast Gard's affectionate hopes.    While his burgeoning amorousness met with such blighting  encouragement in the direction of Fraeulein Elsa, it encountered  unexpectedly an immense and yearning bosom in another quarter.  Fraeulein Wasserhaus, next door, clamored for a mate. With cowlike  simpleness she almost bellowed out for love. Of an age verging on  the precarious she waddled into and out from Villa Elsa with bulging  breasts so bared, under the transparent pretenses of white gauze,  that Frau Bucher declared herself shocked. She said that the  Wasserhaus was trying to be a part of the disgraceful Naked _Kultur_  that had been assailing Germany.    When this bovine soul came to know of Kirtley's presence, she  fastened her consuming desires upon him. She had a brother in  America and actively developed a hankering to go there and be near  him. Yoking up with a Yankee would be a most natural and fitting  state in which to negotiate the Atlantic.    As the Bucher wall was too high for her to hang over in her  languishing ardors, she hung over her gate to offer a book or a  tiger lily to Gard as he passed. Several times when the  pachydermatous Tekla banged her way upstairs with an armful of  utensils in her work, a bouncing compote or other unabashed delicacy  would be tumbling about on a dustpan or a slop basin, bound for the  attic room by the linden tree. Twice a belabored missive accompanied  these little couriers, anxiously quoting some anguishing  sentimentality from one of the household poets writhing amid the  pages of the affecting Gartenlaube.    It was at first so bothersome that Gard contemplated leaving the  neighborhood. Even the Buchers, truest of prosy Germans, could  grasp the ridiculousness of this situation, and it was the one item  of noisy fun they could fall back upon when they wished to be  especially entertaining.    \"Mein Gott!\" the Frau would cry out when going over her troubles and  arduous occupations. \"And I've got to get a husband for the  Wasserhaus yet!\" The Herr often went into a deafening rage about it.
